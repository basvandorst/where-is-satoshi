So like LN?
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:44:53
Is that a problem? I mean... Yes, big data, strong pc...
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:51:34
By solving a complex mathematical problem. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 19:06:57
Im nobody... But is op nobody too? He didnt introduce...
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:52:01
I mean, clearly the term is useless for bitcoin and should be redefined. But yes, on wall street, a 10% drop is a crash.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:02:32
Then dont buy it... Reaearch alts, buy an alt you think will grow. If it grows, great, sell into bitcoin when bitcoin dips. If it doesnt grow; youre more knowledgeable and you can get into bitcoin's dip!
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:57:54
?? Who is op? :(

Its not a currency m8... Its a """store of value""""

Yeah but the rest of the world &gt; usa.
@_date: 2017-12-04 12:52:10
Can you post the transaction ID? Im curious about the fees you paid and the actual time it took for 6conf. Because intent to sell is not the same as selling.
@_date: 2017-12-07 12:38:07
Ah i thought it was like 1 node owned by bank of america...
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:30:48
Rx480 provides 22MH/sec. You need 1 TH/sec to not be rejected. He can mine altcoins with a powerful gpu.
@_date: 2017-12-02 19:51:45
Right. Thats fine i think. As long as the option for a "better service" is there, I am satisfied. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:57:13
In 2011 you could have mined hundreds of bitcoins on your laptop.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:21:40
Yep, miner here. Stopped mining btc cause bch looks out for miners. Same pow so idgaf.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:36:14

Buying at ath and it grows is no better than playing blackjack.

No, the network will reject you. Your laptop is too slow. You need at least 1terahash/sec to get accepted on the network.
Your laptop will output at the most, a billion times less than the minimum required.
With your laptop, sign up on nicehash, it will allow you to mine altcoins and get a btc payout. 
You will mine about 20 cents per day, if you mine 24h a day, and your laptop will overheat a lot and will be unusable because 100% resources used on your laptop. 
Electricity costs will be 5-10cents per day.
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:34:59
Uh nope, 100% profit reasons... Mining btc is not profitable anymore because of the direction its going in. I just dont feel safe mining btc, even if it went up by 1000%... 
Bitfinex, fees, tx times... I gotta maximize profits and minimize risk. Bch does that.
If btc fixes their shit, ill be the first to switch back.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:30:05
Nah man, bitcoin isnt about an independant system to the banks, its a bank add-on. The white paper should be changed to fit the bank's needs.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:26:44
Stop spreading BS. Both currencies have the same address. If you sent bitcoin to a bitcoin.com wallet, itll put it in the right place.
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:51:30
10% acceptance
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:30:38
Youre saying this cause youre hoping it wont tank to 1 cent each btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:31:56
Why would you buy anything at ATH?
@_date: 2017-12-09 13:25:49
@_date: 2017-12-03 23:23:44
The newcomers are correct. A crash in trades is a 10% drop. Bitcoin crashed like 4 times over the past week.
Obviously its not as damatic for crypto as it is for the rest of the stock market. But its still called a crash. You cant change terminology because you dont like it.
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:36:07
100% sarcastic
Dont let that whitepaper title "ELECTRONIC PEER TO PEER CURRENCY" fool you. Btc = gold. Just think of fees as the bodyguards you pay to safeguard your gold.
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:53:11
If the entire world uses bitcoin, amd everyone is forced to donate 1sat/byte, the fees grow over time.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:50:08
Bitcoin is decentralized? Are you living under a rock?
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:53:34
focus on bitcoins, not on the people pushing alternatives. Ad hominem fallacy...
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:29:18
Why would they need LN when they can handle 50k tx/sec by increasing block size?
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:39:58
Yeah! Lets call him the opposition names till he breaks! Thats how we show technological superiority!
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:36:34
Fake satoshi??
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:47:29
 Btc can handle 5.5/sec at max adoption and bch can handle 8 times that + an extra 100bytes per MB for all except the first MB per block.
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:35:38
how would an agreement crash the network?
@_date: 2017-11-22 12:38:07
No competitors, government sponsored monopoly!
@_date: 2017-11-18 20:13:42
Why do you think they owe you an apology?
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:55:25
I think you think tx increases for block size increases are linear.

Well its an attack on the brand... Imagine if people people started calling bitcoin bwit...
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:45:40
Are you saying bitcon is an alt??
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:52:31
But bitcoin forked to integrate segwit... It just so happened that there was no other fork at the time. If there were, what you know as bitcoin would be called segwit coin or bitcoin core or something.
Basically, its luck that segwit is called bitcoin while sharing bery little of bitcoin legacy's code. 
Bch is bitcoin legacy's code.
@_date: 2017-11-17 19:25:55
Dude tell someone... If you die, its 0$...
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:44:27
100% agree im on xp, f windows 10
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:30:31
I mean, btc can process 5.5tx/sec at 100% adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:24:35
The internet is centralized, no doom there...
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:41:01
Lol what
@_date: 2017-11-20 12:23:30
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:28:07
Yeah so adoption rate
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:55:19
Domt worry man. BCH is just a pump and pump.
@_date: 2017-11-23 18:33:53
Yeah lets boycott things that you cant use anyways!! /s
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:52:04
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:05:08
Same pow, can use same miners for bch and btc. Cant use an s9 for eth.
@_date: 2017-11-20 17:23:47
Header size is constant per block and adoption rate. Im at work, ill try to remember to do the math tonight
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:44:15


Do you realize how wrong this statement is? You've essentially managed to dissolve an agreement by yelling at people... I think you owe them an apology...
People can do whatever they want. They shouldn't have to dissolve an agreement because other people aren't happy with it and threaten them.
EDIT: Not you personally, but I definitely believe they're owed an apology by people that were vocal about it. They didn't change their opinions overnight, they were under pressure to cancel it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:41:58
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:35:53
 Bitcoin Gold should be referred as Gcash.
Bitcoin Diamond should be referred as Dcash.
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:20:56
Not price, profit.
If something is 100000x easier to mine for onlu 1/100th of the profot of bitcoin, its more profitable to mine.
@_date: 2017-11-18 22:07:48
Thats your opinion...
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:02:43
Im afraid of high btc fees so i think im gonna trade to btc and keep my crypto on an exchange to avoid on chain tx fees.
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:57:54
dislike? Digging up someone's entire past, claiming fraud? How is that dislike? It's extreme hatred.
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:21:38
Bch has the btc pow, so its more profitable for miners than getting new gear for monero.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:36
Changed the protocol? I dont think you understand... Bch reverted the segwit changes. Bch is essentially the original btc code without code corruption.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:50:03
You know theres an actual bcash, which is a mix of bitcoin and zcash?
