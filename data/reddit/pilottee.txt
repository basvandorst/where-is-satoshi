Hey there, Is this opportunity still available? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:58:11
That put the most sincere smile on my face!

Hey, I’m a Xapo teller and would be happy to send you BCH  or another currency in exchange (also use exodus, so our currencies are probably similar) . DM me.

I have a tourist visa, opened up an account at Wells Fargo in mainland US no problem, no questions asked.
@_date: 2017-12-23 19:18:12
I’d have around 0.10239082 BTC

I thought we all already got off with the price?

I’ve never used Bitfinex, if you’re using the bank card that they’ll issue you instantly, you can purchase online from any country. (I’m from South Africa and have used it many times for purchases in store and online in multiple countries), so if you’re using your card to buy, it’s all good.
I think they’re talking about actual bank transfers, like if I were to try send money from my Wells Fargo account to my bank at home.
I can however confirm that the account does accept incoming transfers from other countries (I have been paid by a client in the UK into my Wells Fargo account).
With regards to bitcoin purchasing, It’s been ok, I do use multiple platforms and haven’t had an issue with any of them so far.
Good luck!

Hey there, there is some pretty useful info on r/BitcoinBeginners as well. Welcome to the family and good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:38:17
No problem! To be honest, depending on how much you’d like to buy, Coinbase seems to be the place to be these days. I sometimes use Changelly.com for quick and smaller coin purchases too :) 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:18:29
No problem, it’s a great solution for lazy people who like things to look pretty, so suits me just fine! :P

If you’re feeling adventurous, checkout Exodus’s beta wallet “Exodus Eden” it has quite a few more currencies available compared to regular Exodus.
I used Exodus and switched to Eden last week.
They’re both great imo.

You had me believing you were serious, until the “Ver Guy” comment!
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:20:00
I’m enjoying Exodus Eden, it’s unsupported though, their official and supported app is Exodus. Pretty handy, nice UI and has ShapeShift built in

I always suspected Hal Finney. If I created something like Bitcoin, the first person I’d send funds to, to test it, would be myself... 
Also died though.

The premium that BTC was going for on your site says that perhaps some are interested in getting rich quick first.

Pretty cool, but would be nice if we could view all trades without having to select them manually.

I bought satoshirad.io :P just though Satoshi Radio sounds cool :P doubt it’s sell-worthy 
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:07:01
Haha - I wondered about that PE post in your history :P
It’s a great place, I love it here, they just get funny with crypto :P maybe cs it’s not Beer or Chips �� 
I’m super amped for the festivals this summer in Antwerp!

These guys with their 32mb block sizes.
Today there were less than 20k Bcash tx’s.
32mb / 226 bytes (avg tx size) = 148,470.94 tx’s
Conclusion: Bcash totally needs 32mb blocks

@_date: 2018-04-18 16:50:19
Yeah, 82 days ago you said 32mb block sizes aren’t needed. What has changed exactly in 82 days besides less tx‘s on bcash?

Binance doesn’t require verification. 
They have an API but I’m not sure on what it allows - I believe trading is one feature
The definitely don’t do fiat deposits though 
@_date: 2018-04-04 18:55:11
Ah ok, well that makes WAY more sense! 
@_date: 2018-04-07 06:15:16
Thing is, even if they’re reputable and have no intention of robbing you after the fact, it doesn’t mean that they took enough precautions to ensure every set of private keys are secure.
My advice is spend the extra cash on a HW wallet, buy less BTC initially and add some as/when you can.
Personally I have the ledger nano s, and i don’t regret it at all. The coins are kinda cool and I see the novelty value, and if you’re going only buy a $20 coin you could probably risk it.
The other thing is, they don’t tell you the amount of BTC you’re getting?

What does the value of a transaction have to do with efficiency?

This ��
Paper wallets are risky because if your computer or printer or usb drive that it’s on / was created on has had internet access it is vulnerable. 
The cold storage coin - well, you’re trusting that someone else made you the equivalent of a paper wallet securely and you now need to trust them.
@_date: 2018-04-04 19:02:13
I wish I knew.
I’m South African, but living here, and if you mention crypto these people lose their minds. There are a few guys who do meet ups etc, but that’s it.
I live in the Dutch side of Belgium and like a 30min drive North into the Netherlands gets you a completely different response.
(In general Belgians are odd though)

It’s only a bad idea if you sell it for less than $50 later

You missed all the fun with randoms claiming the handle, tweeting about Turkey. 
A good time was had by all

Doing it atm. Really really helpful and educational!
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:39:38
Yeah this is either coordinated or ever trader is part of the hive mind and just happened to sell at almost identical points.... 
What is also interesting is that if coordinated buying and selling is happening by certain people/groups, regular Bitcoin trading etc is incredibly flat which also isn’t so great...
