Don't take a loan for that long time... What if you get fired? What if the company bankrupts? Then you will have to sell it to repay debt. Take a loan for 2-3 years maximum. Also, NEVER (literally never) invest in alts, because you cannot afford losing 1 BTC, you are taking a loan for gods sake.... Remember- 1 BTC = 1 BTC. Always.

Simple step-by-step solution for small amount of Bitcoin:
\-Scan your computer for viruses (if you are still concerned, install fresh os for this purpose!)  
\-Go to [electrum.org]( and download the wallet  
\-Unplug the internet  
\-Install wallet, create standard  wallet, choose wallet encryption option, choose 12 words seed  
\-Write down the seed on the paper and do not store it on digital media, ever.  
\-In Electrum, click on receive- thats the address you will send your funds to  
\-Send funds, it may take some time to arrive (exchanges usually have to approve withdraw, then you will have to wait 10-40 minutes for confirmation, depending on transaction fee)
\-There is option for Multi-sig (multi signature) wallet and standard wallet. Multi-sig wallet create multiple private keys that are required to make a transaction, you probably don't need this.  
\-The seed are words from which is your private key derived. On Bitcoin (or any other crypto), there are 2 keys- private and public. Public key (or address) is the key to which you send your funds, hence the name. Private key is used for accessing the wallet and making transactions.Never give your private key to anyone, there are no refunds on blockchain.
Caution- Electrum is so called "hot wallet", its called that way because it's running on your PC and you have immediate access to it. This could be a good thing, but it has drawbacks. If your computer is infected, your wallet may not be safe.
If you plan to hold some bigger amount of BTC, spare yourself of hassle and buy the hardware wallet. Thats USB like device that keeps your private key in super secure environment (private key never leaves secure chip). You can use it even on infected computers because you have to physically press the button on device to verify transaction. I would recommend you to buy Ledger Nano S or Trezor. Personally, I prefer Ledger because of its simplicity and beautiful Ledger Live program for computer. Setting up is simple and straight forward. Just follow the steps on device.

Thats the catch ;). Govs are claiming that inflation is around 1.5- 2% annually, but feel free to check the prices of electricity, gas and groceries in a year. They are not 1.5% more expensive every year but 4-5%. That's the real inflation metrics. If you don't trust me- DYOR. Go to the nearest grocery shop and write the price of the milk, for example. Then log in to [futureme.org]( and write an e-mail to yourself with specific brand of a milk and grocery shop name. Send that e-mail exactly 1 year to the future. Check again in one year. The price will not be 1.5% higher ;). That, my friend, is inflation.

Are you retarded? What should he do, trade them from wallet?? Sorry but thats not possible. The guy is a TRADER, he trade with his assets. And to trade, you MUST send funds to the exchange. Also, he made it clear thats not a very big deal (it's obvious he's a wealthy individual since he has 5 BTC for trading) for him and he wrote this as a warning. Nothing more and nothing less. I **hate** when someone tries to help someone and he gets bashed by idiots.

I didn't tried to explain to them, because they don't really care about that. They pay for their things with money, everything works- they're happy with their tunnel vision. They just see and care about FIAT value I made. I don't care about fiat value and I invest in alt projects just to make more BTC and ETH. That are the only two prices I care about. When you start looking at the price in BTC or ETH, market volatility is extremely reduced compared to FIAT and this will give you enough time to make smart decisions without any hurry. A lot of people here plans to hold BTC for year or more, yet they give too much significance to daily/weekly price movements. Personally, I will start using my savings when it becomes spendable (not sellable) without instant BTC to FIAT services like Bitpay- when people really start to see the value of cryptocurrencies.

Thanks for asking :D. There is bigger possibility for Earth to be hitted by electromagnetic wave than finding (or mining from asteroid) big amounts of gold anytime soon. I am not against BTC but you can not destroy gold,its harder to steal (one quick scan of private key vs transporting 30 metric tons), there is no password to be lost, it has growing real life use. BTC will be mined in 100 years yet gold reserves are rapidly declining. Do the math- growing use and declining production= growing price.

-He is crypto enthusiast (not a trader or HODLer of big amounts)
-He is not rich
-He doesn’t own -worth to kill- amounts of crypto
-He is just coming to the crypto world
If he had big amount of crypto, he wouldn’t post comments on Reddit to get ~100$ worth piece of (not significantly,but still) damaged tech- he would sacrifice .0015BTC to keep his wealth safe.
I know this is not BTC joke or meme but it would be nice to choose me :), because I’m the guy I described up there(btw, my crypto worth is around $40 “big”, so if you’re killer you will not profit from me lol XD)

Are you serious?? Inflation is GOOD for economy. People INVEST their money because of inflation. You (and me) are investing in BTC because we want more from our money. Which means- inflation works just as intended- it's running the economy. That's the reason why I will always be for FIAT existence (and BTC as digital gold- reserve currency). Having BTC as daily currency would return the world to middle ages. There would be no incentive to invest your money (and run the economy, aka WORLD)  if you know it will be more worth tomorrow than today. Inflation is good.

If you plan to store at least $500, buy a ledger (ledger will cost you around 10% of your investment). If you plan to buy less than $500, buying Ledger is not worth it and you could install Electrum on your computer.

All cloud "mining" contracts are just pyramid schemes. Old investors get paid by new investors. But the caveat is, you can never withdraw what you've deposited, and it's very hard to break the pyramid, if not impossible. Even Bernie Madoff would be impressed by this.

The truth. He accepted the ALL possible risks when he gave him money to invest. No promises- no liability. Also,  even if he promised, he owes him just the amount he invested. Using your logic-if he pays him 60K today, and Bitcoin jumps to new ATH, he owe him more money. Also if Bitcoin crashes, the investor will have to return the difference.

If you want to totally reset their records, do this. Buy XMR on any exchange (doesn't have to be decentralized). Withdraw XMR to wallet. Create new BTC address. Open [coinswitch]( choose XMR for BTC option. Send them XMR, they will send you BTC to your new address. This way, Coinbase will know how much worth of assets you have, but they will have no way to know how do you spend them. I recently used Coinswitch, it's a bit slow (30-40 mins) but it doesn't require KYC nor account.
Super privacy tip- if you want to mask your IP and information about computer (serial number, model, os version etc.)- Use TOR to mask your location and IP and  [User-Agent Switcher]( to mask your device info.  
EDIT I wrote [coinswitch.cc]( but its [coinswitch.com](

lol, bitcoin has already 2 new generations (SegWit and Lightning) of development, and you are still comparing other coins (mostly schitcoins) with legacy btc?
@_date: 2019-12-02 02:21:58
Yes, I agree. But  what was the capitalization and price per coin? Large markets (BTC now) are stronger and can absorb anything you throw at them, but if you break them- you probably broke them for good.

Rewards will not be a reason for mining a long time before 2140. Right now, miners are getting mining fees and rewards. After the last btc is mined, there will be the fees.

The cost of the physical energy you used to lift that phones to that stand, set them up and plug them in is much, much higher than the amount of BTC that will be able to mine in a lifetime- you spent more money on the food which provided you energy to do that than that miner will produce for the rest of your life XD

It's governments. Banks will never die, they might do a shape-shift but they will never die.   
Imagine the ad: "Your crypto is safe with us, military grade security blah,blah...send to name, not the address with our anti fat-fingering services"  
They will run exchanges, take fees...offer you saving interests, you can see where is this going.  
But with one major difference. They will not have fractional reserves nor possibility to print as much crypto as they want. They can work against people, but not against the protocol of blockchain ;).

It will work when say “1000$ to bitcoin”. But the title is “how much does 1000$ worth” and it shows btc value.
@_date: 2018-04-27 13:16:14
Doesn’t work. It asks me to what currency I would like to convert.

@_date: 2018-04-09 16:00:21
This sounds like good idea, but thats all. 
It would be nicer to say:” I have 100k of Bitcoins” instead “I have 0.001 Bitcoins” and “He’s rich, he has 4 Megabtcs”. But because there is a smaller unit name(Satoshi),change would just make confusion.

The best time was 2 weeks ago, second best time is now. Also, because you don't want to invest a lot of money, I would recommend you alts. Preferably some high risk alts, because high risk- high return, and if you lose your money, its not the end of the world, its just 100 bucks
@_date: 2019-05-25 15:55:46
One of the best (relatively) high risk-high return token is BOMB token. It has only 1M token supply, it's the first deflationary currency, there was no an ICO, all tokens were airdropped for free, the team has 10% of the supply (other projects are usually in the 20-30% range). Current Market Cap is just above $1M and there is A LOT of place to grow. $1M in crypto space is nothing, any token can achieve that, but not every token is the first in something, they are usually copycats of some another coin while BOMB is different, there is no other deflationary crypto. ETN isn't a good investment IMO, but that's just my opinion :) Check out bomb at coinmarketcap.com/currencies/bomb

The problem is next, Christmas lights will be here for few days, not the 24/7/365. Next problem- Christmas lights are sustainable. People use them for decades, and will use it in the following decades, unfortunately I can not say that for BTC. In the next few years, there will be only ~10% of 21M to be mined. The rest is meant to be mined for the nex 100 years. I am bullish about BTC, but BTC will not be worth 500K in 2023..so we have a problem. No one will want to mine it, because it reward will be small compared to price.
@_date: 2018-12-24 23:51:08
It's interesting to hear another well argumented opinion, I really like this debate :).
Did you know that BTC uses as much power as Chech? I understand that security=complexity=high power usage, but I think there are better (more efficient) ways to make BTC secure and efficient. One more thing, BTC is so secure that it really doesn't matter if it immediately became 50% less secure. It still requires trillions of years to hack ANYTHING.

@_date: 2018-12-24 23:36:25
You are kind of right. It is a great thing that power is making BTC, and I am not talking about that, I am talking aboit efficiency of that.
Thats like external combustion vs internal combustion engine. Both will make the car move, but internal combustion is much more efficient.
@_date: 2018-12-24 22:35:45
Thats great, but it's still WASTED energy.
BTC energy consumption can power a LOT of better things.
Please don't tell me the classic "It's not wasted, it's backed by BTC itself" because its not true, there are much more energy efficient and sustainable alternatives for mining BTC. dPoS, PoS or even Hybrid PoS (temporary solution) are energy efficient alternatives. If you are thinking that PoW is sustainable for the long term, you are wrong.
