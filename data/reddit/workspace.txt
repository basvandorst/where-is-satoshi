If that's the principle you're using then that involves banning all talk of alternatives, so not just positive talk of other cryptocurrencies but also negative mentions are them. "LiteCoin/Ethereum/BCash are trash" would be just as bad and off-topic as "LiteCoin/Ethereum/BCash are the future".

You could have spent that $1000 on buying 10 coins instead of mining 1.
If you mine at a loss then you'll probably end up making a profit when the coins later go up in price, but you won't make as big of a profit as if you'd just bought the coins with the original money instead of using electricity and mining at a loss.

Maybe it will happen someday, but it certainly hasn't happened yet. No outside observer would compare the two at the moment and think "yeah, BitCoin Cash, that's the canonical BitCoin".

My first concern was that it's unclear where exactly you're drawing the line. What makes you an "altcoin pumper" rather than someone who has a genuine opinion that another cryptocurrency has the edge over BitCoin in one area?
My second concern was that this isn't really about keeping people "on topic" and talking about BitCoin, but rather it's about keeping everyone "on message" and saying positive things about BitCoin (so talking about other cryptocurrencies is allowed if you're saying negative things about them, but not positive things).
For example, this thread mentions one BitCoin exchange ordeal but the thread is clearly about BCash (although it's negative about BCash). Should that be allowed on a subreddit that's dedicated to BitCoin?


This thread is also about Roger Ver and and not about BitCoin itself. Same thing, and it doesn't even have the *tangential* relation to BitCoin of mentioning Mt. Gox:


And if anyone thinks I'm a "shill" or an "altcoin pumper", I've never bought or held LiteCoin, BitCoin Cash, or any other cryptocurrency aside from BitCoin and Ethereum (I primarily have BitCoin).

Well you've convinced me with that amazing argumentation.

What counts as an "altcoin pumper"? What kind of advocacy for other counts is allowed?


Yeah, it's dumb for them to say that.

It just seems that a discussion of BitCoin would naturally involve comparisons to other cryptocurrencies (as an investment, on a technical level, etc.). Sometimes people will think that BitCoin has the edge, sometimes people will think that other coins have the edge. If people can say that BitCoin is a better investment tool than Litecoin, but they can't say that Litecoin is better for day-to-day transactions (because that's "pumping" or "shilling" and "they can do it in their own subreddit"), then readers really aren't getting the full picture. They're getting the comparisons where BitCoin comes up on top, but not the ones where it doesn't.
And what happens if all crypto subreddits do that? They end up as echo chambers.
