What platform are you using?  
 I guess you're trying to make an algorithm. I've been thinking about this but haven't done it myself.  
So first, get the data. An API I guess.
Then take the values you want, normalise them to  whatever values would represent a buy or a sell. Take the average and that's your signal.
That's my thoughts.

That's "Shi" (as in satoShi) in Japanese katakana, and also a cute smiley face. 
As in "Ess hat" sounds like sat.

I'm thinking sideways around $12k for a couple of months.
@_date: 2019-02-19 08:03:08
Sell sell sell. It's going down to $2k before it goes up again.

You did it to early!

Yep. I'm buying every 2nd day. Time cost average ftw

Can I buy Bitburger bier with Bitcoin?!

The catalyst, as I see it, is if this run gets higher than the previous peak. About $4.1k. 
If it does then $3.2k might have been the bottom and we're heading for the moon.
Of course it's likely that it will drop back to $2k in the next month or two. And even if it doesn't we'll need to wait at least 6 months to beach $10k again, and a couple of years before it's $100k or $1m.
@_date: 2019-06-26 01:57:29
Yeah, I'm waiting for a 20% pullback. Ben waiting for 2 months now .. fml

Lambos are cool bit I'm saving for a Tesla roadster with the hover rockets. Or possibly a SpaceX rocket to the moon.

When you see the rollercoaster, that's when you sell.
@_date: 2019-06-29 00:18:58
Well we can be certain of one thing, it will go to the right. All the time I have been following, it has gone up and to the right, or down and to the right. Never to the left, so that's something I guess.
@_date: 2019-02-24 02:11:45
Rollercoaster guy is the sell signal. This is the pinnacle, it's all downhill from here.
@_date: 2019-06-29 09:06:03
Great Scott!
@_date: 2019-06-16 05:16:05
Shit. Do I buy now? I was going to start accumulating at 7k... Surely it will dip again before  the next big bull run.
@_date: 2019-02-19 08:02:15
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh. Thx.
@_date: 2019-02-22 13:39:38
Yep, any bot worth its bits would know this is a sell signal.
@_date: 2019-02-18 18:36:15

@_date: 2019-02-06 09:47:14
At this point it's not worth pinning it. The issue is resolved and it's an electrum problem, not a bitcoin problem. Promoting it further only discourages people who are at r/Bitcoin looking to invest in Bitcoin for the first time.
@_date: 2019-02-21 09:10:06
Ahhhhhhhhhhhh, a sandwich! Of course, thanks for clarifying. I thought a $7 was a bit low, even for a small actual Cuban.

@_date: 2019-04-02 05:53:54
Hmmmm, under $5k is say. 
Hodl or sell?

\^ It's Roger Ver.  
 Your reverse psychology won't work on us bud!
@_date: 2019-04-27 03:26:09
When it went through $10 in 2011 it receded to $2 once. When it went through $1k in 2013 it receded to $200 then recovered slowly. 
Maybe it will go lower. Certainly if it goes under $1k I will lose a lot of confidence, still a good buy but the $100k or $1m thesis will be less likely.
@_date: 2019-04-03 10:06:05
It is very likely to drop back down to the $2k range over the next year before the bull market gets going. 
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:40:06
That's the bottom. If it goes below $2k for long, we're stuffed, but it won't because we're going to bounce then slow and steady ramp up to the moon! 
@_date: 2019-04-27 02:41:08
It would be so easy to trade if btc was a consistent sine curve.

In five years, if we are successful, we will implement socialism comrade. 
We will no longer have to pay for lunch like the greedy capitalists.
Also, there will be no lunch.

Meaning it was full of hodlers trying to expound upon the virtues of the wondrous Bitcoin. 
It appears super cringy to non believers. Like a scientology thread with people raving about the benefits of having your brain detoxed. You can't blame us though. We just want the price to go up to the Moon!
@_date: 2019-01-02 11:41:17
It's definately going sideways.
@_date: 2019-01-10 10:06:01
Patience buddy.  We may well go below $3k before we go to the moon.
@_date: 2019-05-04 09:32:49
What is Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-05-25 01:41:39
If you can't spend it, what's the point?
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:47:50
I think it will go down to $3k. I didn't think it would go this high, so there's some doubt, but I think it's unlikely this run will keep going to $10k or ATH. It's too early.
Have a look at the run in May 2014. I think this might be a similar situation.
@_date: 2019-05-12 03:00:29
Yep. The weekend warrior / drinking trader bubble is gonna pop when the institutions open on Monday morning.
No reason we can't push it to $9k before then.  
Yay! Lambos!������...��
@_date: 2019-05-11 07:17:59
$6900, lol.

Sorry bro, I hope I'm mistaken
@_date: 2019-05-14 05:28:14
Woah. I'm a dribbling moron compared to the brilliance of your intellect.
\s. I'm not really.
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:22:21
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:15:15
Probably not the best time to buy. I think it will go down again .. but what do I know.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:35:38
@_date: 2019-05-25 01:39:50
Dude. 
I personally think it's too early for the big bull run. I'm waiting for $6.6k (20% drop from $8.2k high) before buying. If it goes over $8.2k I'll eat my hat, and buy.
@_date: 2019-05-22 07:15:20
It's just as stupid as cash or physical gold. That's why it works.

Wow. I always wanted to be part of a community that has ideas like this. I imagined a small community of very rich people, but a large community of moderately rich people works just as well!
@_date: 2019-05-10 08:15:38
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:20:46
Yep. I've been selling since $5k. I think it will go to $100k in the next few years, then $1m but not before it goes below $3k. We'll see.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:57:17
Jeez, he's just being a little too honest there.
@_date: 2019-05-11 04:04:57
Well it's gone up again
@_date: 2019-05-25 16:56:13
A stock goes up, if your not able to sell it and spend the profit, what's the point of the stock going up!? 
Also, yes, many stocks pay dividends.
@_date: 2019-05-11 03:35:54
And that's the peak.
