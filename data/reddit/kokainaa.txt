2 business days within the country $40 fee
 3-4 international $60
Interact debit is 30 min$ 1.50 
The fact that your stating to not use Bitcoin as a means of transfer which is a utility proves that most economists are correct that Bitcoin is a bubble. Bitcoin needs to get its act together transactions that take more than 40 min to confirm is ridiculous and not how it was in 2015.

I don't know if this is really an attack. Miners are voluntarily choosing to not mine btc for BCH. Miners always had the option to mine what ever they want.

Yeah it's alternating between the two, BCH will have the miners again when it's more profitable for them. What every bitcoiner should be wary about is that BCH is in a better position to fork a version where it's consistently better to mine in the long run. The fact that Bitcoin is even experiencing this makes me question the value.

By BCash supporters you mean miners right? Because it's the miners that are switching from one chain to another which is causing the delay.

What attack? The miners have always had the right to choos what to mine. If miners are leaving your chain then it's on the chain to figure it out.

Remember how Bitcoin is decentralized? Well not so much, your going to have to wait for the oligarchy of miners to switch back to the btc chain to mine and confirm those transaction.

I don't think it's over, seems like the Bitcoin civil war just got started.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:55:05
It's because miners are mining bcash instead of btc.

Bitcoin is going to give justification for banks to further increase there fees now lol
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:02:36
I would give it a couple days I think the Bitcoin civil war has just began
