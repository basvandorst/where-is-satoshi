EOS is the answer wait till it starts running...  wont slow down at all!

Understandable,  Crypto manipulation is to the point where whales could leave a large amount of people unhappy (broke)
@_date: 2018-05-04 17:37:04
Lol hey gains are gains.  I bought EOS at .76 and i am doing very well now.   Have you went away from doge coin?   EOS will still go up in the coming months.
@_date: 2018-08-02 20:28:10
Not only that, gold still has a tremendous value compared to Bitcoin.  If thats the case then all stocks are somewhat manipulated.
@_date: 2018-05-23 20:55:23
Not true...    bitcoin is far from centralized “far from centralized”. To control bitcoin any government would have to own every computer mining the coins in the world!
@_date: 2018-08-03 13:43:05
Generating and manipulation are two different things...
@_date: 2018-05-04 15:45:09
Oh is life going to slap you in the face.
@_date: 2018-08-02 16:51:24
Manipulation is a “dam” good reason to decline an ETF.......

@_date: 2018-04-12 21:06:43
I am helping this guy out with his career change, which hopefully does help.  Spreading awareness in different types of coins only progresses blockchain.  One doesn’t have to be blind to other coins.  Bitcoin serves one purpose alts serve others.  
@_date: 2018-04-16 12:14:38
Contact EOS platform.  If your idea is good enough they will fund it.
