"Plummets"... it's only down 5.95% for the day and 8.34% for the week

As optimistic as this subreddit is, I've found most of the people to be correct. Bcash pumps and dumps, January dip followed by a nice rise, etc. Obviously there's some issues so I have no idea how things will go more than a year out, but I'm really optimistic about bitcoin, ethereum, and a few other cryptos over the next year.

I can now buy almost 4 of my car that I bought 4 years ago :) Also, I feel like bitcoin provides lots of good, better-than-free entertainment.

They're saying it'll shoot up and the adoption rate will be higher.

Sometimes I wonder if people are telling others to sell just so they can buy
@_date: 2017-12-28 06:19:41
I didn't check it today for 7 hours. New record (minus when I sleep).
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:15:17
In that case, I'd encourage more people to sell
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:30
I'd love to see 6k or 7k again
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:23:13
I think this is definitely a possibility. Have an opinion of when you think it could happen? I'm figuring I'll keep my money in for a year to avoid capital gains taxes, maybe longer depending on how things go.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:48:49
Similar views here. If I can hold for a year, I'll owe 0% in long term capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:29:34
 1h, 1d, and 1w all show the recent downward trend. Currently if you bought in the beginning of December, you'd be coming out roughly neutral or slightly ahead. If it keeps going down like it has since the 8th then those people are going to be hurting, at least for awhile.
@_date: 2017-12-15 07:19:05
Relatable. Got my degree in elementary education, but got too sick to use it. I'm able to work 3 hours a day most of the time at my office job and I'm lucky to get disability money. I'll check out OMF! It's frustrating when there's no cure and doctors don't seem too willing or able to help.
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:02:52
As usual, feeling like I should've bought more! Oh well, got most of mine at around 6k so I'll be doing alright either way
@_date: 2017-12-10 07:19:07
Some people bought at, say, $17,000 and then when the price decreased, they got worried that they'd continue losing more and more so they sold at, say, $15,000. Most of us expect it to rise above that again so then when it goes to $19,000 the person in this example would've lost 2k plus not gotten in on those gains. That's why a lot of us think it's a good idea to hold.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:57:22
*sees btc going up $100* No, stop, keep going down so I can buy more!
@_date: 2017-12-07 06:06:35
Yeah a dip will happen eventually, but maybe it'll go from 25,000 to 15,000 in which case you'll be better off if you bought now. Hard to say when the dip will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:12:38
At the moment, it seems to be holding near $14,000. No guarantee that it'll go lower. I'd say hold because I see it going above $15,000 in the future. But if you're super worried, no harm in taking out some or all of your investment.
@_date: 2018-06-11 06:48:38
Yeah I was expecting stocks to drop this week and cryptocurrency to increase in price because of G7

It seems like every currency will eventually fail and/or be replaced by something else. The USD might be overdue.

If people have their coins on there even for a short time in order to buy or sell, they're still going to get screwed over unfortunately

Yeah I'm assuming that she only knows about bitcoin. I think her opinion might've been somewhat sour between the volatility and knowing that it's been used for black market stuff. But it's a good sign that she vaguely understood the purpose of it and that people have asked to use it. I'm not as bullish as some people, but I think bitcoin has some good things going for it.
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:44:01
He wasn't trying to keep the money on an exchange though. He immediately tried to sell it according to the article, and he wasn't able to get that money out.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:50:07
It's going down slightly at the moment. I put most of what I can afford into it at $6,100-6,250. If it gets to $5,700 I plan to buy more. I think $5,500-6,100 would be a good time to buy.

I work at a nonprofit that brings in millions of dollars a year. I asked them about accepting cryptocurrency. My boss said that once in awhile they get requests to accept it, but she doesn't see the need for it at the moment, especially since most of our donations come from older people who don't own crypto. She knew that it's used for privacy reasons and to "try to take down the banks". I pointed out that there are currently some good use cases for it, like international transfers. I thought it was interesting to hear what she thought about it and learn that a few people have asked to pay using crypto!
@_date: 2019-02-19 05:06:14
There's a Trezor app, so maybe you can connect the Trezor to a phone? I'm not sure what the functionalities of the app are.
@_date: 2019-02-20 14:10:28
Tl:dr; The risk is mostly 51% hacks and smart contracts. It's mostly about cryptocurrency in general, but I thought that some people might find it interesting.
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:47:17
This is what worries me. People want to believe that if you're responsible with your coins, you won't get screwed over like this. Unless you avoid exchanges completely, there's some risk. People can lessen it by moving their coins to a wallet, but I still think it's an issue.
@_date: 2019-02-01 07:20:03
I wonder how often these get used considering the extra cost
@_date: 2019-02-09 23:14:13
I mean think about nationwide nonprofits like United Way. I'm betting they also get millions.
The 2 highest people in my organization often work ~60 hour weeks and each get $50,000-$100,000/yr
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:25:02
50 bitcoin? So you're charging  $350,000? Seems reasonable
@_date: 2017-11-23 09:04:53
Do you have a link you could send me so I can use a copy of this for myself? I love spreadsheets like this!
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:46:44
Yep, I'm waiting as well. With stocks, the common saying is "don't try to catch a falling knife". I think the same applies here. We just don't know how low it's going to go before it [hopefully] rebounds.
@_date: 2019-02-10 01:22:17
Wait, if you're not bullish at all then why do you think people should invest in bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-17 04:46:24
You can download an app called Blue Wallet. Create a lightning wallet, click receive, and then type in the number of sats to create the invoice. Click the withdraw link from the intip bot and copy and paste the invoice there. It's only a custodial wallet though. If you have a node, you can set up your own channel I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:29:59
I'd recommend using gdax.com if you can. You just use your coinbase login, but you can set limit orders without any fees.
@_date: 2017-11-23 03:33:01
I'm sure if you'd be willing to pay for shipping, they'd send you one. I ship a lot of things for my company and the US gets free shipping but we charge shipping fees for international orders since it costs us double to send.

Sounds like I need to move to Germany to be honest. I fit into the category of being disabled and the US government is only helping me to just barely get by. If I didn't also work part time, I'd likely be homeless. I'd prefer a system that's somewhere in the middle between what the US has and what it sounds like Germany has. Are most of those things Germany's form of welfare? It seems odd to me that certain immigrants can get those things but poor (likely non-working) immigrants of other skin colors/religions and Germans can't.
@_date: 2019-04-25 07:20:02
Why work then if you can get all those benefits without working and you think they have it better?
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:22:22
Ah ok, I don't know what it's like over there but I get sick of people here in the US saying how easy it is to receive and live on welfare. "Just claim you're crazy and get on disability" they say, not realizing that it's an incredibly difficult process to go through and many people on disability are still in poverty. I hear it often about all sorts of safety nets from people who seem to not care that there are a lot of people who genuinely need the help. But yeah, I'm not a fan of people who have zero desire to work despite having the ability to do so and yet want as many benefits as the German system gives them.

We were in the $6,000s for a bit longer than this and it dropped again, so I wouldn't say that we're necessarily out of the woods yet. My long term (at least 3 years) outlook is that we'll be higher than the current price considering that bitcoin development is continuing and we're seeing things like the new cryptocurrency wallet on the Samsung Galaxy S10. You could do dollar cost averaging to put some in now and then put the same amount (in dollars so that you're buying less bitcoin when the price is higher) in later.
@_date: 2019-01-27 07:41:17
I'd think so because it could introduce a lot of people to the concept of cryptocurrency. To people who weren't previously invested in cryptocurrency it might also make it seem more legitimate. Maybe it'll be seen less as magic internet money if it's somewhat backed by a trusted/real/well known company like Samsung.

This is my plan. I sold about half of what I had. I figure if it keeps going lower, I'll probably buy back in. If it goes higher, it happens; I'll be making money off what I have left in there.

I hope you're right, but in April and May we were over $8,000 and the price decreased after that

This statistic always surprises me. I lived in poverty for most of my adult life and am disabled so my income is low. I've always had at least $1,000.

It's confusing to me because let's say that I transferred $15 in btc to myself, which was my whole wallet balance. The transaction ended up sending $20 and being split into $15 and $5. Apparently the amount that went into my wallet is the same amount that I sent, but the other $5 got sent to the other address. Maybe I'm just too tired to process this right now ha I'll have to take a look at the transaction again tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-12-24 10:07:16
I keep thinking the same thing. To me, cryptocurrency is not an easy thing. I have a trezor, have made multiple transactions, have checked my seed to make sure it works, and I double check the addresses for every transaction, but it still seems scary. There are a lot of people out there who are more careless.
@_date: 2018-12-26 01:10:49

Got it, I guess I hadn't seen that yet with my other transactions. Thanks for the help!
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:27:26
ah I looked that up, so after enough confirmations it'll eventually go into my wallet?
@_date: 2018-12-24 08:18:21
Question: I sent some btc from coinbase pro to trezor, but the transaction split into 2 addresses. The one is for almost $5 and is different than the transaction fee. Is there a fee that I'm paying besides the transaction fee? I can provide the transaction addresses if needed for someone to check it out
