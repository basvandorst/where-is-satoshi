Fiat is capable of deflating.
Governments choose not to do this. In democracies, you are free to elect leaders who will choose to deflate a currency. 
Bitcoin is incapable of inflation.
There is no choice.

Try paying for a round of beers with cocaine.
It's not exactly a smooth transaction.

What does a miner need to do to receive a 50 BTC reward? Which wallet does that 50BTC come from?
It is creation of new money, to pay a miner, in exchange for doing math.
The situation will change once we hit the cap, though.

Difficulty doesn't matter if you're not mining. There is nothing special in terms of security about leading 0s.

In general, yeah, the record is the record and the implementation might do math as part of the feature list. 
But Bitcoin is an implementation, and it does math. And we are discussing Bitcoin, which is distinct from other coins because of the math.
So how is Bitcoin not about using math to create value?

How does one process a transaction without doing math?
