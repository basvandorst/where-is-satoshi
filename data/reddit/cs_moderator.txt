check out the list of exchanges which are a substitute to Shapeshift - [

Shapeshift’s hand was forced by US  lawmakers, likely with the threat of subpoenas and prosecution should it  fail to change its business model. That being the case, it should be  noted that any other US-based Shapeshift competitor is liable to meet a  similar fate when it’s built up enough business to attract the attention  of US prosecutors. For now, at least, the following services provide an  alternative means of switching between cryptocurrencies such as BCH,  BTC, and ETH.

Great, are you planning to hold them , or you are wanting to trade them and diversify your portfolio? 
@_date: 2019-03-22 09:42:54
Great,  I do not know if you are a newbie or you have some little experience  with trading, you should definitely hold some of your BitCoins, but if  you are looking to make some profits then
* invest  in some of the AltCoins, remember do not see the price, price is an  important factor, but currently since the market is at all time low, see  the VALUE of the project which it will bring in next 5-10 years, like  BAT Token, LTO Network, Maker and couple of more.
* Learn to keep your funds safe (Learn what happened recently with cryptopia, and the famous mount gox exchange)
* Use a non custodial exchange, which does not hold your funds for longer run in there wallet.
* I work at [coinswitch.co](  exchange, you can check us out, we are an exchange aggregator platform  that is you can compare the prices offered by leading exchanges like  Binance, Changelly, ChangeNow,  KuCoin, HitBtc, HuoBi, IDEX etc on us,  and trade either with best rates or with any exchange of your choice,  and you do not even need to login or do KYC.
* The  benefit that we bring from CoinSwitch platform is - You do not need to  create account on multiple exchanges, since every exchange has limited  no. of coins only.

okay, I get your point.
@_date: 2019-06-07 08:30:40
exactly my thoughts!
@_date: 2019-02-19 07:13:20
I am going to do an experiment, ask random shopkeepers and various other vendors, if they would like to accept bitcoin for larger transaction, specially in Mustafa market, little India, and china market, there are lot of local vendors who sell cheap goods.

In my personal opinion, the most reliable and safest way to store any crypto is (either for investment or for trading too) by having a **hardware wallet**. There are various reasons to support this:
* Hardware wallets are basically external devices that are only connected when a transaction has to be performed. When disconnected, they are isolated from PC and thus from the internet itself. This helps in securing your private key that’s stored inside the wallet.
* In online wallets, your private key is stored on an online server by a third-party application (the software) and chances of your wallet getting hacked is **very high**.
* The pin or password helps in securing your wallet, so, even if somehow, it gets lost, or stolen, then you don’t need to worry about your cryptos being stolen. But, you do need to remember the password as without it you won’t be able to access your cryptos.
With that being said, some of the recommended hardware wallets are ***Ledger Nano S, Trezor*** and ***KeepKey***, etc. 
But if you don't want to spend a $100 bucks, or are looking for a wallet that has an in-built exchange feature then ***Atomic Wallet, Exodus, Guarda, Coinbase***, etc, are good choices.
But no matter what, the safety of your funds is the MOST important thing when dealing with cryptocurrencies, so choose your wallet accordingly.

please do not give such advice to anyone, people have lost a lot of money, market is 90% down since 2017-2018.

I don't even know whether to trust this supposedly new Facebook crypto they're going to release, after seeing their ability to provide privacy and security to FB users.
After all, the main concern after having cryptos is privacy and security. And no one would want to compromise with that.

BNB wasn't, but 7000 Bitcoins were stolen, accounting to over $40 million.

I wasn't spamming. I was just providing information on both the wallets. And as for the link, it is for an article that describes the differences between both the wallets. 
But if you still think it's spam, then I'll remove it.

We are in a massive scam zone, not believing them is the best.
