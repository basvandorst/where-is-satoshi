Omg, never heard of this.  Thanks, you've just officially killed my afternoon.  Now I have an entire new concept to grok through, lol
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:00:02
ooh good idea :)  thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-27 19:08:34
Took a quick look and this information doesn't look available through the public api's on the exchanges i have listed.  Do you know of any way on how to get this info?
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:00:03
thanks so much!
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:37:59
just submitted to as well.  hopefully they'll give some feedback on the code , but i'd also love some feedback on potential project ideas here too :)
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:59:58
Completely forgot about IRC :)  Thanks man!  Hopefully I'll be doing some cool stuff like you someday!
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:53:54
Sweet thanks!!!!

What features would be useful to you?  I'm thinking of adding a major update to this so we can access all the exchanges api's, not just the price ticker.  Would probably use oath2 since that's what i see most exchanges have as their login security.  
@_date: 2015-01-06 18:35:33
What command did you use to install it?  It probably did not install to your global npm repo.  If it runs the test then it's definitely somewhere on your pc, just need to point to the correct location of the lib.  
Maybe try var xchange = require('./lib/xchange.js');  
or  
var xchange = require('../lib/xchange.js');
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:10:33
Well yes that's why i'm posting this project on reddit :)  Need some review/guidance however I can get it.  
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:23:38
thanks!  Most of the exchanges don't actually this in their ticker api's.  I thought if I added it , then most of them would be blank which would be confusing.  It wouldn't be hard to include however, if you need to tweak the source, just update the apis.js json file and also add the relevant line to the response decorator.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:17:34
Cool, yeah I plan to add all the major exchanges in xchange.js at some point.  If you have any suggestions like this , feel free to issue a feature-request/bug ticket to [the xchange.js project](
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:48:00
Yeah I read the Satoshi's whitepaper and have been looking to speak with other devs.  Seems the best place is here on reddit and bitcointalk.org :)   Let me know if there's any other hidden resources!
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:51:54
Can you elaborate a bit on what you mean by currency pairs?  Do you mean have the response display have a field for both usd and say cny (or whatever currency)?  Unfortunately, this btc-stats library sits on top of my xchange.js project which is somewhat limited currently.  The btc-stats is my first example of what you can do if you have all the exchanges information located in an easily accessible way. 
  
Yeah so my roadmap is to actually refactor the xchange.js project into 1 large library that lets you interact with literally _every_ exchange and _every_ api that each exchange exposes.  So something that lets you access the functionality of say bitfinex (usd), btcchina (cny), etc...   So you can do wallet transactions, login to your account, see spot prices, all of that.  The thing I want to eventually make would be 1 super super simple api with common responses (i'd have to aggregate everything and wrap the responses into something common among them), and also provide really easy to use documentation.  Think of what Stripe does for the online payments but this would be for Bitcoin transactions.  
  
Would you find this valuable?  Maybe we could chat for a few minutes on IM to see if I can get a few of your ideas?
@_date: 2015-01-07 18:39:59
Your comment is resonating with me and now I'm torn on which direction to take.  I'm starting to think this ideally would be a separate project and I should have named it something other than xchange :)  but I'll think of something, and create at least 1 other small module with analytical functions.  I think I'll leave the ticker() in xchange but incorporate some other exchange api's such as accessing wallets, etc..  To me something called "xchange" should be related to functionality of actual bitcoin exchanges.  I agree, analytical functionality should be called something different altogether and kept minimal.
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:33:44
Thank you kindly :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:03:59
ahhh ok , that gives me some more ideas actually :)  I think alot of the requested features will rely heavily on xchange.js , so I'll have to look to revamping that one first.  Once this base module is built I see alot of possibilities for things like what you just mentioned above.  I might ping you in the future for some feedback once I get this going :)
@_date: 2017-02-27 04:37:35
Maybe coinbase?   I have a small nodejs library that attempts to wrap most of the exchanges APIs into a single common one.  
Actually if you have any suggestions on how to extend this or other side project ideas I'd love to get some feedback.  From my experience on this project though the best api was coinbase
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:55:20
I'm still very new to the concept of decentralized exchanges, so forgive me if this is a simple question.  But can you explain the major differences between BitShares and Ripple?  
@_date: 2015-01-14 14:41:46
As a software developer who's fairly new to Bitcoin -  
 How/where can I learn about the mining process in general?  
The algorithms, methods, etc...  I've been slowly learning as much as I can about cryptocurrencies, but most of my learning has been from resources fragmented across the internet.  
@_date: 2015-01-06 16:57:52
Awesome thanks!  I could use help testing :)  Please let me know if you can think of any other useful features!
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:32:55
Whoa, wasn't even aware of this!  Thanks!
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:08:04
it is in the readme?
In the first section...
"Bitcoin price api to calculate statistics on spot prices across exchanges. Uses the xchange.js module to retrieve current ticker prices.
Note!! This is highly in the Alpha stage.
This project currently supports the following exchanges
bitfinex  
bitstamp  
okcoin  
btce  
bter  
hitbtc  
ccex  
@_date: 2015-01-06 17:33:29
Hahaha, was waiting for someone to mention bitstamp.  Thanks for the tip!  
@_date: 2015-01-22 17:15:04
I very much miss listening in on the Diane Rehm show.  My work schedule changed a few years back and I always loved the discussions here.  I'll definitely take a look when I get home tonight.  
Thanks for sharing
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:33:08
you're very right, sorry about that :)
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:24:54
Here's a relevant explanation on stackexchange -  
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:48:34
For something like that you'd probably want a REST endpoint that you could consume in php.  I think some of the exchanges provide api's for this from their side, but you'd have to go through each of their docs and consume it yourself.  Maybe I could expand this project to aggregate all of the different endpoints and expose them through one common easy to use set of endpoints?  Maybe even add my own REST documentation to display it all in 1 central location.  Would be a cool project.  
PM me , we can talk about this.  
  
Would anyone else find something like this useful?
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:59:49
Also... you're project looks great :)  That's actually my next move after some basic analytic functionality.  Create a complete api wrapper for an entire exchange (say bitfinex or whatever), then move onto another exchange , etc..  until I have all of them wrapped into 1 awesome library.  Maybe add some good looking documentation somewhere so devs have an easy way to look through the inputs and expected responses.  Let me know if you'd want to collaborate sometime
@_date: 2015-01-07 13:59:27
cool, yeah i was taking a look last night.  i wasn't even aware of this project so thanks for the tip!  This is why I come to reddit :)
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:55:00
Awesome thanks!!  Can you think of any additional features or enhancements that would help me differentiate?  Even if it's just performance or documentation related?  
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:09:36
Ahh wait, I think you're referring to the dependency xchange.js project though.  It's not in the xchange.js readme.  I'll have to update the docs on that project.  Still a learning process :)
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:49:45
You're right , thanks for pointing out my mistake.  I'll update this soon.  I had to set the user agent for btc38, as it was required.  I think I just copied/pasted the agent from my browser and overlooked this.  Thanks kindly for the code review, wasn't trying to be evil :)  
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:25:57
Can you please give a little background on the history of the company?  In particular, I'm curious how bitcoin exchanges are initially formed?  As in the initial motivations, who was involved, first steps to create an exchange, etc..
@_date: 2015-01-06 15:51:48
Cool thanks!  So, now my next question because I don't want to continue re-inventing the wheel.  Do you know of any other features I could work on, either related to this project or not?  Any other ideas that haven't yet been coded or could use some help?  
@_date: 2015-01-06 19:55:49
That's actually something I've been pondering as well.  I decided to just keep this minimal for now and let the client choose their own implementation.  
Is this something you could see as useful in the future?  I've looked into Q, but will have to research bluebird.  
If I end up creating some analytic functions (probably my next phase), such as average, median, etc..  I'll definitely use some sort of promises library inside the lib, so it probably won't be too hard to add this feature and expose it for users.
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:16:26
Thanks!  Coinbase isn't an actual exchange though.  They pull their info and work with other exchanges, from what I hear mostly from Bitstamp but others as well.  It wouldn't make sense to include in this project I don't think since it would just be duplicating data.  Perhaps this should be added as a separate section in the app though.  Would have to think how I'd want to integrate it.
@_date: 2015-01-13 16:00:29
Just wanted to point out that Stripe is working on implementing Bitcoin into their system -   
  
Hopefully this takes away alot of the pain points.  As to all the different api's across the different exchanges (transactions and others), you're right the system seems too heterogenous to me and many of the exchanges api's and docs suck.  I'm considering working on a bitcoin exchange wrapper to aggregate everything into something more easier to use.  Just need the time :(  If anyone's interested PM me, it's a node.js project
@_date: 2015-01-06 20:11:43
Thanks so much for the feedback!  Yeah , it looks like there's a couple unused dependencies I'll have to remove.  Thanks for the catch.  I've never heard of superagent, so i'll take a look tonight.  
Thanks for the contact info, I'm sure I'll connect with you at some point!
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:15:02
I have a personal goal of a new project every other week.  So just check back every other Tuesday and you'll see more posts from me :)  Or follow me on github, my profile could use some friends, lol
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:52:50
That's on my todo list in Trello :)  These are all based on my [xchange.js]( project, which will undergo a major update.  Feel free to pm if you're interested in collaborating/contributing!  Or even just to help give some suggestions.
@_date: 2015-04-09 00:57:04
cuz the LTC ain't got nothin on BTC
@_date: 2015-04-09 01:01:50
May I?  Look inside 'yo wallet.. for 'yo keys and.. snatch a little sumthin..
@_date: 2015-04-24 13:48:12
Can you explain a bit how you envision the "virtual gift card"?  I like the idea of not having to setup a wallet and make it super simple for someone to use bitcoin without knowing much about it.  However, it seems like the different exchanges (changetip, etc..) _sort of_ have this feature already.  I mean this in the sense that I don't really need to know much (or anything really) about wallets, just send me some bits and i can spend it how i want.  Perhaps the more difficult part is how to actually _spend_ the money from your virtual wrapper.  How do we get vendors to accept payments from it?  Each vendor taps into the given exchanges api's to do the transaction, we'd have to sell the vendors on this, correct?  
  
PM me if you're serious about exploring this.  I like this idea alot actually
@_date: 2015-09-04 01:02:42
been watching you for some time, you helped me out on some advice a while back.. kudos on these numbers!  
this is an inspiration to me :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 15:57:15
  Thank you for posting this.  I probably would not have heard about the hackathon if it wasn't for this follow-up post.
@_date: 2015-02-19 19:48:17
I'm very interested in this question as well.  And while we're on the topic, where does BitPay get it's exchange rate?  How is the market rate determined on all of the exchanges (they're all different and sometimes have a fairly decent size variance).  
@_date: 2015-02-20 03:23:24
You coinlock , are awesome.  thank you for taking the time to post this.
@_date: 2015-02-19 21:46:48
This clears things up a bit for me.  I'll do alot more research on this, but your reply along with the Stackexchange posts help clear up my understanding, so thanks.  
  
I'm not confused on what bid/ask is , or spreads, etc... My question (I probably should have worded it differently), is how is the literal USD exchange rate calculated (as in...  when they represent it in their api as a single value), which you sort of hinted at.  Is it an average of the last few transactions (if so how many), is this done across different exchanges, if so which ones and etc...  Is there any amount of variance included?  
  
This is all out of personal curiosity though because sometimes I'll see an exchange rate seemingly drastically different between 2 different exchanges.  I was wondering if there was some industry standard or if each exchange has slight alterations in how they calculate it.
@_date: 2015-02-19 20:03:09
Thanks for the link.  Gives a bit of info I didn't read on BitPay.  
  
However my question still remains, how do the "individual exchanges" come up with their exchange rate?  Basically BitPay is saying.. we calculate it for you based on our algorithm, which I'm not criticizing.. just trying to find how this stuff is actually calculated.
  


@_date: 2015-02-19 20:33:26
C'mon no need to give me that face :(  I'm legitimately trying to learn (still relatively new to bitcoin in general).  
  
I've read through these before -  
  
  
  
  
Point# 5 in that last link is where I'm confused too.  I usually see exchange rates different from what i see in the last transaction price.  I need to do some more reading/homework though, but maybe someone can give some guidance?
@_date: 2015-02-19 18:51:05
"Stripe charges just 0.5% per successful Bitcoin transaction. There are no other fees."  
  
WoooooHoooo!!!
