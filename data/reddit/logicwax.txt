Checkout Twister.  It was an attempt at making a decentralized clone of the Twitter service, using a blockchain-based system for user registration and DHT for messaging.   Very similar to BitMessage.   The mining incentive is that you get the privilege of advertising on someones twister feed. Where it falls apart though is that mining blocks in twister is only for user registration. 
I always thought that they should have used the blockchain for messaging as well.  Miners essentially mine blocks of TX's (that are messages in of themselves, just like bitMessage) but get to include ads as their mining incentive.
You could take this farther and build a decentralized blockchain-based GMail system.  The miners get rewarded with putting ADs at the side/bottom of your email.   Their mining provides the storage of emails in the system and the bandwidth to handle it.  The miners can even resell the ad space or outsource the actual advertising to others and be simply brokers who inject it into users' email messages.

What exactly would this altcoin be serving, in terms of a DAC, to the world?
Bitcoin is a Decentralized Autonomous Corporation/Organization, where people all over the world have set up servers to run a global payment network (miners).  Those that lend resources to run this network, are rewarded by the users of said network (We agree they deserve a coinbase TX, and give "value" to said tokens which can be exchanged for fiat, etc).   Miners do their part for selfish reasons, and we benefit from their services in exchange.
So what exactly would redditCoin be supplying?  Are miners creating new shares?  New shares for what?   Why would we want to support running a kick-ass trading platform for only reddit shares?    
Do they even need a blockchain for this?   Just send out crypto tokens.
It would be interesting if the mining incentive was something related to providing services for the website itself.  Such as lending bandwidth, storage, etc in exchange for voting points or advertisement space.   Twister was an attempt at doing this, where miners helped to support a decentralized Twitter social network, and were rewarded with ad space in your twitter feeds.    Using a new isolated blockchain to offer shares of your company "just cus blockchains are sooo cool" seems like a misunderstanding of how DACs like Bitcoin operate and why they exist in the first place.

but why not just use Alice's original pubic key?   In order to spend her inputs, she needs to prove she owns the address (that the prev inputs were sent to) by disclosing her pubkey (that others check if it hashes to the correct address).   Why go through the trouble of creating yet another public/private keypair?    Wouldn't this afford the same privacy?
@_date: 2014-02-01 23:57:11
yes, I thought the nonce was the pubkey of the payer, as shown in this diagram:
can't both parties arrive at the same shared secret via:
alice's private key * bobs pubkey = bobs private key * alices pubkey  ?
so bob would just scan every transaction of the blockchain, take the pubkey of the payer from the transaction and multiply it by his payee private key, then add that value calculated to his pubkey (and privkey), and see if that pubkey equals the output address of the transaction.   If so, it's for him (and use his privkey from that calculation to spend it).  If not, then rinse and repeat for every other transaction.
I hope I understood it correctly, because I was really impressed by this trick..

Too many posts here recommending not to use Brainwallets.... Brainwallets weren't used in this case (and other brainwallet implementations like Warpwallet are considered safe anyway)
I'd like to point out that another source of weakness where entropy can bite you is during signing of your transactions.  What did you use to sign those transactions over to your final addresses?   This has bit Android users before as well.  If you don't use a wallet implementation that doesn't make use of RFC6979 then you are sourcing entropy every time you sign a TX, and if it's weak entropy, then your private keys can be revealed if you sign using the same private key more than once.

Internet is microwave-linked over from the nearest town.   Also, Papa-Legba camp runs a open-source (OpenBTS) GSM/UMTS network that allows anyone with unlocked cellphones to text/call each other, and they also periodically bridge via VoIP/etc to the outside PSTN.

why is OP_RETURN necessary?  isn't the pubkey of the payer part of the transaction anyway?  (doesn't alice/payer have to prove she owns the previous address used as an input by divulging the pubkey that would hash to that address?)

Why bother with an ephemeral key?   Why not just use the private key of the payor's address coins are being sent from?
PayorPrivatekey x PayeePubkey = shared secret
PayeePrivatekey x Payorpubkey = shared secret
Then payee just scans every TX and multiplies his privatekey by the pubkey of each output of every TX, and then takes that shared secret and adds it to his pubkey, and then checks to see if that's the output destination address.

There are other better ways to implement brainwallets, such as using PBKDF2+Scrypt (key stretching) instead of plain ol' SHA256 (for which there are lots of mining equipment laying around to use as cracking machines).  Key stretching prevents rainbow tables from being easily generated.
I recommend checking out WarpWallet,

The QR-code found on that card does indeed scan, just that with the resolution of that photo, the grainy noise, and angle you are past "the tipping point".
I played with that vanity QR-code a lot and found a good level of error correction just below the tipping point where that it would scan on every iPhone and android phone I could throw at it (holding the phone a few inches directly at the card under optimal lighting conditions). I tested it every Bitcoin wallet found on the AppStore including a few QR-code scanners.

I've noticed that after about almost 300-400 transactions breadwallet will stop working correctly (hang on sync, and/or crash exit the app).   I'm assuming the bloom filter gets too cluttered and perhaps the developer needs to split the wallet into several different bloom filters in order for breadwallet to scale.  
For those that need to go in and salvage their money you can try the BIP39 generator on github, and remember that breadwallet uses /m/0/k for normal receive addresses and /m/1/k for change addresses.

That's why I forked Warp to be a Bip32/Bip39 generator: 
@_date: 2015-08-14 04:50:29
No way.  Just because brainwallets began with horrid implementation doesn't mean all brainwallets are bad.  brainwallet.org used the same EXACT hashing algorithm that ASICs were literally built to crunch out at amazing speeds for mining.   That's a terrible idea.   
Other than users not exercising good password practices, brainwallets mainly need to concern themselves with resistance to rainbow table generation.   brainwallet.org used SHA-256, allowing rainbow table generation to be performed at crazy fast rates.    Warpwallet, on the other hand, uses both scrypt AND pbkdf2 to perform key stretching.   Stretching is a SERIALIZED function that cannot be processed in parallel.   In other words, it slows down rainbow table generation.  That's the entire point.  Creating a rainbow table for 8-character passwords in WarpWallet takes magnitude's of more time than a simple SHA256 in brainwallet.org.   In addition to this, Warp has a UX feature to allow input of an email address to act as a salt for the password, which means any attacker would have to devote their cracking resources specifically to you.   They also have a contest running "The WarpWallet Challenge" with a bounty for anyone who can crack warpwallets with x amount of chars as the password.   Currently, the 8-character password has a reward for 20BTC!   This is a pretty smart canary if you ask me.....if someone cracks the 8-char reward and you have a 10-char password, you will have some time to prepare and move your funds elsewhere.  If you can remember a password that is 10-chars long of a pretty unique ""random""ish sequence of characters, then you're not going to get cracked.   The resources required to generate rainbow tables of the entire 10-char space in WarpWallet would far eclipse the amount of BTC you hold in it.     Even going through every word and every quote or song lyric would (spelled correctly) would even be out of reach with warp (but realistic with brainwallet.org).    As years go by and hardware gets faster, the key stretching iterations can be increased.
I've (very hackily) forked WarpWallet (  ) and added the ability to generate BIP39 mnemonic sentences and BIP32 extended keys, for easy import into any wallet (mobile or desktop or web) of your choice.   I've kept all my BTC in these without any problem.

@_date: 2015-08-19 00:02:12
Is it though?  If every wallet client, mobile or desktop or web, ignored and rejected the new changes....then wouldn't the few miners staying back on the older version be the new direction of Bitcoin?  (While the new version miners are forked away into their own imaginary world).     It always seemed to me that Bitcoin is more of a UX thing.   It is what the majority of its users say it is.   With miners being voting power almost like the electoral college system.    If every user (and non-mining node) acts like Bitcoin can be more than 21 million, and a few miners join the party, then it seems the momentum of those users decide where Bitcoin is.  Or perhaps you could argue it is whatever the fiat exchangers / money processors say it is.  
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:18:27
No, you're not considering that accidental (or intentional forced) loss *IS* a vector.  If it's a paperwallet then that also means I have a back-up plan to re-generate it in the event I lose that key (whether paper, or digital).   If key stretching caused the most modest computers to take a full week to generate one key, then rainbow tables are impossible (which is another fork I've made, btw).  And I'd much rather take the "theoretical" cracking of an extremely stretched key from a brainwallet risk over the risk of me having to maintain the data integrity of a private key.   Remember, you can roughly calculate how much money in hardware it would take to crack these stretched keys, allowing you to control whether it is financially in anyone's interest to even attempt to crack your wallet.     If you follow good sound password practices and can come up with any 12 characters that even "seem" random (and also fill in the salt email field), then you have made it not worth anyone's time/money/effort to crack a wallet with anything less than 30-40BTC (I'm pull these numbers out, based on the 8-char WarpWallet challenge which hasn't been cracked yet and is worth 20BTC).    
@_date: 2015-08-19 01:10:09
how could they manipulate unspent outputs if they can't re-sign the TX?     MIM can only really block transaction / silence data.
@_date: 2015-08-19 23:34:54
First off, Warpwallet on github has the complete compiled html file available (warp_src.html in the root, and also in the "web" sub-dir).
Secondly, I forked Warpwallet to include BIP32/BIP39 generation:    (very hacky, I still need to clean it up a bit.  Going to include a coinb.in or some js wallet maybe soon).  I use this to import BIP39 mnemonic's into Breadwallet, Android Wallet, Mycelium, Hive, etc, and never had a problem.  
 
Warpwallet is awesome.   Key-stretching makes rainbow tables harder to generate (the more time you spend to generate a key, that's longer a cracker is spending per rainbow table row).  Plus it's not SHA-256...using the same hash function that is used in mining is a horrible idea!   You're free to edit the source and make stretching even longer.  I've often thought it would be nice as a back-up plan that if your house burnt down with the private keys in it, that a Brainwallet that took several hours/days/weeks to generate on modern hardware would be awesome.  As a last chance safety net to generate your keys back.  Stretching a key to that extent would make any brute forcing not worth it.  Perhaps creating an algorithm that doubles the amount of stretching every 2-years or so to keep up with advances in technology (although you'd have to remember which year you created your wallet).     
&amp;nbsp;  
Don't forget, Warpwallet has a great canary system:  warp wallet challange!   The 20BTC reward for 8-characters still hasn't been cracked.   
@_date: 2015-08-14 18:39:42
No, that's what nLocktime transactions are for.   Plus, I may or may not have backups of the private keys stored somewhere.   I am much more at risk of losing my private keys due to data loss, or simply forgetting where I have them stored, than I am of forgetting my 15 character password (plus an email salt) which I practice typing in every so often on an offline computer.
@_date: 2015-08-19 00:53:13
regarding 6:  I understand that the curve bitcoin uses isn't exactly 256-bits of security, but it quite more than 128.   Since private address generation uses 256-bit keys it makes me feel uneasy about using 128-bits to source the entropy for all 256-bit keys.   Are you saying that 128-bits of entropy provides the same security as 256-bits of entropy when generating a private key?

I've thought about this before and thought it would work well if it was fully integrated into a client like uTorrent that automatically by default setup a receive address for you and broadcasted it.   That way, over time people would get the idea that if they left their client open it would collect money for them.  
There's plenty of legal uses for torrents and I can see this tipping mechanism really useful for free/Creative Commons/independent content that makes use of torrent for distribution.   Most of the replies on this thread are coming from the angle of people who mainly use torrents for illegal content, but if you haven't noticed recently that the company "BitTorrent" has been trying to market and position themselves as an alternative CDN provider aside from Akamai and all those others.  I remember they were trying to convince Sony to use them as a distribution platform for "the interview".   Think about it: If I'm an indie movie producer I could post my film on BitTorrent and then take any money I would have spent on expensive fast hosting and spend a fraction of that tipping those nodes who seed.  With torrent clients implemented in JavaScript/WebRTC this could be a really attractive solution and low-cost barrier of entry for content producers, especially those that produce content requiring lots of bandwidth.    This would essentially be the decentralized CDN of the future.   
Now add on lighthouse, decentralized bandcamp, and storaj-like features and you got yourself the next Netflix of the future.

it's a deterministic wallet.  So you wouldn't want that feature as you would lose all of the benefits of a deterministic wallet.   Breadwallet does support swiping privatekeys into it though.
In a way, it does.  You can "create" a new wallet, which would be creating a set of addresses.     Unless of course you're talking about pencil and paper creating your address?

I don't pay blockchain.info any money.  I am not associated with them in any way.  They are free to do anything they like.
Sometimes, blockchain.info has went down for a few hours, which has resulted in many mobile wallets completely grinding to a halt.  The app developers aren't responsible for it (they're just using bc's back-end services).   It's already a big leap to rely on a decentralized payment service for transactions.  Why also rely on a 3rd party centralized service whom has no incentive to service you?
A SPV wallet is a true bitcoin thin client.  You only need the bitcoin network (and a working internet connection) for it to work.   The store of value you own is entirely by cryptography.    No other centralized service needed for it to work.
Think of it like how people type in website names into Google out of laziness.    Sure it's nice....but do we really want to do away with the DNS system?   We don't want to be dependent off of Google for domain resolving.
@_date: 2015-02-20 22:48:52
Absolutely love breadwallet, amazing work, so this is in no-way bitching.  Just suggestions:
Few things:
1) The touchID logic is really weird.   It only asks for PIN (and not TouchID) when making transactions.  although filling out balance, clicking on lock brings me to touchID.     It's not really pointed out that tapping "breadwallet" initiates a touchID auth request either.  There should be just one TouchID prompt at the beginning of opening the app (like how bitWallet does it, or circle, or coinbase).   That way it's simple UX, and once authenticated, the user is able to go in and do whatever they want.
2) are push notifications supposed to show when the app isn't in the foreground?   I can only see a pop-up in-app notification only when the app is in the foreground and loaded.
3) the notification bubble could be shown longer (slower fade-out), higher up on the screen.
4) push notification should also include a sound notification along with it.  Lots of people I know rely on this audible sound with the other wallets and android wallets during rapid merchant exchanges.
5) would be great to have display in BTC, and not be forced to use bits.
6) 24-Word BIP39 support!   If we rely on 256-bit private keys, why not 256-bits of seed entropy as well for a HD wallet.
7) configurable fee's
8) when entering in amount that exceeds wallet amount, automatically adjust accordingly (including adjusting the amount so that amount+fees=walletbalance
9) adjust red/green "receive" and "send" widgets to resemble colored arrows.
10) include full time in transaction log (as opposed to just the hour number after the date)
11) ability to configure the app to automatically launch into camera scanning mode when launching the app (since a common use-case for mobile wallet apps is to open-&gt;immediately fill out info to SEND money)
12) handling of bitcoin URI handlers across the OS.   I noticed AirBitz has taken over handling these on my system...is there any way to configure/over-ride?
13) on my iPhone6, the app displays with the "enlarged"/low-res status bar across the top, usually reserved for apps that haven't been updated for i6/i6+ displays yet.   Is there a way to update it for these displays?
14) add visual queues to "receive money:" and "send money:" such as arrows or icons
15) get rid of address re-use prompt.  If I'm using breadwallet, it's not ME that is using insecure practices of address re-use.  It's the person I'm sending money too.   They should be warned about it, by whatever means, but useless to warn me.
16) the decimal button on the keypad when entering amounts-- it looks like a comma.   
17) About screen-- update to 2015.   And put a donation address in there too.   Take my money!   I want to support this.
18) consider using green or blue coloring around the app.  It's been psychologically proven to make users feel more secure or that the app is more "professional" when it comes to money dealing apps. 
I get that most of my suggestions are subjective about UX, however, most bitcoin software suffers from the problem of engineers designing the UX/UI which doesn't really communicate well with the general population.   Breadwallet has excelled in this case, which is why I've turned my attention to critiquing every detail about it.   Keep up the amazing work!

Key-Stretching is not snake oil.  It's use is primarily for rainbow table resistance.   If it takes me 1uS to generate a row on my rainbow table (for say, SHA256) and you move to a hash function that requires 1mS to generate on modern hardware then you've slowed down my table generation by an order of magnitude.  Brainwallets have been cracked by large rainbow tables connected to the bitcoin network watching for any addresses that match a row.  Generating a rainbow table for SHA256 for 8+ characters is easy stuff these days.  Generating them for long stretched scrypt/PBKDF2 passwords?  Not so much.   Else WarpWallet would have been cracked already with their 8-char bounty.
I'm not sure you understand the utility of BIP39.  BIP39 is a way of conveying the same bits of entropy.  It isn't "bad" or insecure as it it's use is not in security of where you source entropy.    Checkout my fork WarpWallet that combines both these concepts (key stretching to resist rainbow tables, and BIP39 for easy import into wallets):
