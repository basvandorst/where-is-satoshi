Cause this isn't sketchy at all

Ah I see

You would think people would have learned by now from MtGox not to store your BTC online like that. 
I was sketched out having 3 BTC on coinbase for a few days.

I get along just fine. I store my BTC in my Electrum wallet. Coinbase has a function that allows you to send your BTC to a specific address and it will instantly convert it into cash. 
From there, you can deposit it into your bank account. They never have to hold your BTC long term if you are smart about how you do it
When I said "online", I meant on an online exchange/storage wallet. Never let anyone control your BTC for a long time. Just like you should never keep all your money in the bank. It's not a problem with BTC, it's a problem with people being too trusting of 3rd parties

back up

Yeah I'm not taking the bait. Either he is trying to set someone up, or collect addresses for some reason

That's a new message. Looks like they are working on it.

Yeah I'm a broke mofo lol 3 BTC was a good portion of my total savings (for now). Ended up making about $550 though on my first buy in/sell

looks like they were hit by a ddos again -

I don't think it's fair to compare the price 3 years ago to the price now. That was cheaters in the market, this is an actual market value
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:37:27
I made a lot trading above $1200 actually, but that last trade was a mistake :'(
@_date: 2017-03-19 13:36:51
Lol I already had my cry when we were nearing $900, now I'm just trying not to stress out and wait it out lol
@_date: 2017-01-06 14:57:15
Yeah, they could...but then they'd get caught. Like I said, I'm not outright accusing them of this, I'm just saying it's a possibility that one could do it. Maybe improbable, but not impossible.

I can't say for sure, but if I was to speculate I would say to manipulate the market in their favor (either prevent its users from pumping or dumping at certain crucial times).

Legal tender = monetary regulations. 
Keep the BTC market free!
