It is both. Major businesses do accept cyber-coins although the propensity to do so is decreasing with the current crisis caused by the fact that such currencies are also considered as financial assets. 
Let me tell you, it's good for the economy but I think that the big corporations are pushing back against them, hence why we have the current situation.

While you're talking about Bitcoin sinking into oblivion in the future, Ohio may have become the first state to accept it for taxes' payment. You can't possibly deny that capitalism has run its course and that there are more sustainable alternatives to it (which include the use of cryptos).
Granted, there will always be a need to regulate the system but it is far from being a fraud. When the Supbrimes crisis occurred, nobody said that speculation was bad but people realized that there was a need for stricter control in the banking system.

I certainly hope the same. However, when I debated the question with my friends, they were quite unanimous about the fact that the bitcoin price drop actually has a negative effect on all cryptos, thus they suggested that it might not be the best time to invest in either bitcoin or altcoins. However, we all know that while they are very volatile, they are also very popular, so it's very likely that I will buy me some as soon as their price gets low enough.
