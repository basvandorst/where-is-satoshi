Hey thanks a lot! We try to be as transparent as possible. Just makes things easier for everyone.

We launched 2 1/2 years ago. There's another racing(ish?) themed typing game called TypeRacer that you are probably thinking of!

The game is  -- I just didn't post the link above as I didn't want this post to be seen as promoting our products (I see that too much around here).
Oh also worth noting, the bitcoin support is on the new version of the site which is still in open beta at  -- But this new version will be pushed to the live site next week, or as soon as we can get all the final bugs squashed.

Hey, this is a problem on the old site that we fixed on the new site:  (still in beta)
It makes you take a quick speed test first before putting you with real players. On top of that, there's a bug on the old site that prevents guests from racing in the right speed bracket. Oops!

Nitro Type is fortunate to have a really passionate player base. Over time I learned that reactions such as this are really just because people love our site, and want it to be the best thing ever. The majority of times a user will complain, or even say something a bit harsh, its because they believe in us and our game :)
The same goes for bitcoin. is very passionate about bitcoin, and he obviously really wants it to become more mainstream. I can totally understand him feeling let down that we would add it, then remove it! I think maybe its our fault for not being more transparent about our plans, but there's only so much we can do in a days work.
Just another thing to learn from.

Hey there! Thanks for checking us out. If you're looking to teach your little ones, check out our typing tutor  
Nitro Type is more for once they know how to type, but want to get faster (people generally double their typing speed on Nitro Type within a month or two, with many people going above 100wpm within a year).
If you end up going with Typing.com, shoot me a PM with your kid's username(s), I'll upgrade them to gold!

Hey, thanks! I definitely don't deserve it though. Check out this great [list of charities]( that could use your bits though!

Because stripe is super easy to integrate with, and we wanted a smooth way to allow users to choose between credit cards and bitcoin within one little window.
We looked into Bitpay, but it just wasn't quite what we were looking for.
Hope this helps!
