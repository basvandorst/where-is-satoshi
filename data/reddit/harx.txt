also The Newsroom. The list are just getting longer!

Unfortunately you got the facts wrong.
[Better source here](  
**EDIT:** Now this is interesting, it might be a good news, the statement contains:


  
it translate as: Bitcoin is not a unit of currency or a legal tender in Indonesia.  
  
Does that mean it can be regarded as **digital commodity**?
2nd paragraph states:


  
It can translate as: People in Indonesia can freely use Bitcoin at their own risk, because there is no regulation towards it.

I can confirm. My client pays me via Paypal, and I eat those nasty currency conversion. Can't wait for bitcoin to be more mainstream and easy to use in this regard.

Uh, I had to double check if their channel is legit..  
  
  
Yes, they are legit.

Only time will tell.

I've tried, they don't even interested in taking the steps to try it. I guess it is still complicated to use for average joe?

I think one of the reason is because of this news sparks the increased adoption (it's on late October though):

It is because bitcoin is one of the solutions to the problems that was stated on this video.

Amazing. I can't even find a single shop that accept bitcoin as payment method here in Jakarta (Indonesia's capital city). To think that a small island near Bali has one is awesome!

such wisdom

In the butt.

I think we should at least report those videos and the channel as scam or something, in a way to protect new people from these type of videos. 
Dislike it and commenting on it is not as effective as putting it down.

Hi guys, I'm new to Bitcoin, if I were to buy some, is it a good time right now? Or should I wait a couple days for it to collapse a bit for maximum profit later? (Right now it sits on $305)

I'd like to ask about setting up wallet in blockchain.info: Is it considered safe to keep my bitcoins in there (With 2FA, 2nd password etc)?
@_date: 2013-12-16 17:34:40
Ssshhh. He's a wizard.
@_date: 2013-11-25 02:17:07
Wow man, good job. That is awesome!
@_date: 2013-12-09 15:00:17
Somehow I kept thinking that they always trashtalking Bitcoin for one particular reason, which is to let the mainstream avoid it, so it won't get popular and price won't go up so quickly so they can still buying low as much as they can.
Or am I just underestimating their ignorance?
@_date: 2013-11-21 06:53:40
I think this is old news :
@_date: 2013-11-11 18:42:04
Roughly translates to it is still in stage 3 out of 9, which is in its early stage.
@_date: 2013-12-04 18:25:24
Don't forget to secure your wallet.  Use 2FA and everything else  :)
