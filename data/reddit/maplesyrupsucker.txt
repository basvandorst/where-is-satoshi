Smells like troll and smear tactics.

This subreddit has gone to shit. Put the pitchforks away you loons. Go build something better, contribute, and stop just being a worthless hodlr.

I can't help but find it funny that you guys don't see what he did. He weaponized your autistic tendencies to help someone he actually respects. By giving one smarmy tweet to Andreas, countless small blockers donated in droves. 
He helped make Andreas a millionaire, helped miners earn likely around $10,000-$40,000 in fees, and forced you guys to stop hodling for a minute and try spending again.

Thanks for the honest replies. You've left me with more to think about. I suppose the fear of corporate interest has had me very cautious of change this drastic. I see merit in both arguments so just need to read more on both sides I suppose.

But isn't Litecoin a different crypto not built on the same codebase as Bitcoin? It's like, medicine for rats might not work on humans because were different creatures with different genes. 
Doesn't this sort of side chain experiment stifle innovation on Bitcoin? There is a world of money to be made in microtransactions and alt coins are already taking that away from a more trusted network. Then there's the moral dilemma of why is your 50 dollar steam purchase more beneficial to society and the growth of Bitcoin than my five dollar latte. 
I also read that lightning transactions were going to require a subscription payment to process transactions. Whether that's for merchants or large consumers, the end result is larger fees for all consumers as merchants.
I like the idea of faster transactions but it seems that moving off chain adds a whole other layer of trust to a 3rd party that we're all giving power to. 
So to blow out visas tx per sec we would need approx 200mb blocks if you go big block. Which I'll agree seems monstrous. But realistically interest and transaction volume is currently only a fraction of that visa tx volume. Assuming steady growth of Bitcoin over the next ten years and assuming tech continues to grow why not conservatively increase block vs rewrite the original vision of Bitcoin. 
Honest question as I've never read it cover to cover, but was there mention in the white paper for the need for off chain solutions like lightning?

Has segwit been tested with real dollars yet? What about atomic swap? Are we talking like a few million has gone through and we are all sure this is safe and secure? 
I haven't heard a good argument for small blocks with a side chain yet. Explain like I'm five if you can because I'm open. Couldn't processing power handle on chain transactions at a faster speed for a more simpler solution?

The is only one Bitcoin. Bitcoin cash

I'd recommend moving some into cash. Bitcoin Cash that is.

I think the game is over. Big blocks win. Sorry not sorry.

Roger Ver and some fellow big blockers are starting a libertarian country. No tax. I recommend there. Just be sure to trade since for BCH. I hear good things.

I've met Roger, he's a normal dude. You make him out to be something more grand than he is. He just happens to have money, and strong beliefs, and a strong sense of economics. Something this subreddit lacks at times. I'm no more a Roger supporter than I am a Peter R, CSW, Deadalnix. I believe in similar beliefs as all of them, but that doesn't mean I hold them to such high regards as to know when they're being silly. But Ver has never struck me as being silly. That finger was well earned. Might not have been professional but it was funny for all parts involved. We cheered him on. You cheered your guy on because you got a reaction. Everyone won. 
I'd recommend everyone go watch Roger's interview on Rubin Report which aired today. I tried to share it here earlier but it got auto moderated.

Quite peacefully. Usually I'm so tired after a long day of work building different ways to use Bitcoin as a currency or communicate with our growing community and returning old community coming back to make Bitcoin great again.

Gavin was the one trusted by Satoshi to carry his vision forward. Unfortunately Gavin didn't ask for such a burden to be placed on him so he spread it out to those involved in the community at the time. In time it was revealed how much he regretted giving commit access to what would become core. Gavin and Mike were pushed out as they were 2 big blockers vs the rest who were dead set on small blocks despite the cut to utility that full blocks would cause. 
Gavin is and always has been the closest thing we've had to Satoshi and he was spit at for having differing opinions. The mud slinging towards him and CSW is pretty ridiculous. Attacking their ideas with your own is always fair game. But dismissing people based on who they are vs the ideas they bring to the table is juvenile.

Isn't that what segcoin did?

Mob mentality and tribalism is part of humanity. Whether good or bad. But at the very least users keen to read opposing views can open a buried comment and see what the hubla is all about. I hope you don't self censor yourself just for fake internet points. Wear your opposing views, but like any good person keep an open mind versus buying into an idealogy.

Sound money needs to be able to be spent in any way, shape, or form. You guys fall back on the coffee argument all the time, but it's not just coffee. Bitcoin is snubbing their nose at huge, marketable ideas using micropayments that would increase adoption and grow the currency, like it had on the years prior. The system can and has supported larger blocks in the past. What's wreckless is throwing the baby out with the bathwater.

You may be correct but that's the beauty of the hard fork. Letting the market decide which solution works best. We have two sandboxes to see which can support the bigger Castle.  Ten years from now I'm sure we will look back and see all the writing on the wall versus a couple chapters in the middle of the play. 
If Bitcoin cash had the decentralization Bitcoin has would you support its hypothetical growth as a unique path for Bitcoin? Again we aren't sure what the decentralization pie chart truly looks like and I'll admit that's a problem. The unknowns may be a few miners or possibly just one.

Better downvotes than bans no?

That's some Olympic level mental gymnastics. While we're on the topic of time, don't you hate how slow bitcoins transactions are lately? How inconvenient.

I believe he's shadow banned from these neck of the woods, which is unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:39:39
During which time Bitcoin loses more market share, turns off new users and loyal users, and changes a proven method of growth that has worked for the past 8 years. Seems risky.

Andreas has a good speech on why these ATMS are pure garbage. It's in his book the internet of money. Recommend reading it.

YouTube is next to join the identify politics censorship brigade. It's already begun with Mark Dice. 
lbry and steemit seem like potentially good alternatives and could provide additional profit to content creators.

Ensure your website and social media profiles indicate you now accept Bitcoin!

Whenever I explain Bitcoin to anyone the immediate response is "so why isn't everyone using it yet?".
I think it's still at such an early stage that all these posts claiming next month will really win the hearts and minds of the masses is just delusional. My parents and grandparents struggle with facebook. I walked them through torrenting step by step overnscreenshsrinfnmutiooe times for tracking down old TV shows they want to catch up on. They don't torrent. They are barely on facebook.
Until Bitcoin can wrangle the people waiting in line at the back into an easy, trustworthy, non intimidating environment I can't see it being widely adopted until biological obsolescence takes place. Amongst PayPal users maybe. But the bank till visitors might be a lost cause.

Loved that analogy. He's got a way with simplifying things so anyone can understand.
