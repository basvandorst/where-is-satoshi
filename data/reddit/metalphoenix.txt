Fucking there it is. How about "No." At least one purpose of bitcoin was to be outside of the control of governments.

I can see that kinda. Been a long time since I've looked at a newspaper but don't they use title-case too?

Ah, well, there is that.

This is why I use google voice numbers when I have to give a phone number on the internet for anything. I set it up, do whatever needs a phone number, wait a couple weeks and then delete it. Even better for job hunting because annoying recruiters will call years later knowing that your resume is so old that it needs to be carbon dated.

Sorry, let me edit my post a bit so that my question is clearer. 
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:21:25
No, fucking no. You tax *income* and not *transactions*. ~~If I understand it correctly (and please correct me if I'm wrong), simply moving bitcoins from wallet to wallet would qualify for a tax???~~ **Edit**: I have been corrected, thanks.
~~On top of that, the US citizen is getting taxed then when they make the fiat money, when they purchase Bitcoins, when they move bitcoins, when they buy something with bitcoins, and when they withdraw into fiat. Talk about over taxation. This has obviously been drafted by someone who knows taxes but not how bitcoin works.~~

I can see why you couldn't go back in time with them but why not forward?
@_date: 2015-01-08 01:35:07
Thanks for all that. I read that a couple times so the time you spent typing that was worth it, at least to me. So after today, I apparently have 3 wallets, 99 cents in bitcoin, a working knowledge of how it works, several places to purchase bitcoin (with credit card which is far easier for me), and a solid understanding. I saw the post on Coinbase wanting your credit history and saw how they want a photo of your state issued id and since I can't even talk to the guy let alone walk into a physical location, that makes me uneasy (you don't even need a SSN (an SSN?) to open a bank account... But with alternatives at hand, you guys have helped me out. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:34:23
Thanks, I'll be separating my "eggs" ... more work but I see the reasoning.
@_date: 2015-01-16 21:33:36
Thank you!
That only makes sense if you're using bitcoin like a currency conversion investment... which over enough of a time I suppose you are. 
@_date: 2015-01-08 00:30:12
Dude, thank you! That helped me see the process in action and made a lot of things clear :) I'm exploring and seeing just how all that stuff I read works and it's making sense now. 
@_date: 2015-01-26 16:53:00
Why do I get a bad feeling about this? Is that just some silly voice in the back of my head or is it really because "that's no moon?"

bread wallet and greenaddress seem like reasonable services so I'll be looking into both of those more deeply. THanks for the tip

Thanks, checking circle out now. I was tipped a $1 and seeing it actually go is putting it all together for me... suddenly making sense and everything fitting into place.

Dude! Thanks. Hope the charity tip helps someone.
@_date: 2015-01-13 18:04:26
~~I wish I knew some charities to point you to that I could actually agree with... :(~~
I just remembered one that I've used before, if that makes sense...
Cars for Kids.
If you have a car that you can't get rid of (or just want to get rid of), let them know, they'll come and pick it up and give you a tax deduction receipt.
Edit: now they give you a hotel voucher (3 days, 2 nights)
@_date: 2015-04-08 10:17:49
You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.
Seriously, please learn the correct language.

Yeah, because *that'll* get carried down at some point. They don't even carry down dead people. 
Seriously, this is not cool. People take all kinds of stuff up there and leave it and no one will *ever* take it down.

Only if you disclosed it and they wanted a wallet installed on their system (which won't happen)

Heh, sounds like an idea. Keep us informed on your progress. (and thanks for the tip!_
@_date: 2015-02-21 22:57:10
If that were me....
I would walk in, ask to speak to the branch manager, make an appointment if you need to. Dress nice, business, not business casual.
Sit him down with that letter and explain to him that you're closing your account and that you will recommend everyone you know to do the same. Tell him that you conducted a legal business transaction and that your decision is based on sound business sense: your bank is refusing to remain stable throughout your transactions and you will take your business elsewhere. If he wants to explain, feel free to let him. Don't interrupt. Let him get it all out. Then very calmly but firmly tell him "That's your problem, not mine. But you're making it my problem. My decision remains. I am closing my account today." This will show the futility of his concerns. When you're done telling him that you're closing your account, tell him you will be filing complaints with whatever state organizations oversee bank activity.
This will change nothing *for you* but it will send a very very clear message. If banks get this message enough, they will HAVE to comply with ~~your~~ our legal transactions.
@_date: 2015-02-10 02:27:56
And not only is there no way to track it back to you unless you've linked your bank account, you can always say "Hey, my computer is dead." They can't force you to get a computer to get your assets. 
@_date: 2015-02-03 23:51:19
I suppose that's an excellent reason. Thanks for taking the time to let me know!
@_date: 2015-02-22 02:10:22
I suspect that you might have replied to the wrong comment XD
No, seriously though... when you give your money to the bank, you don't have money... you have a ledger, a balance, a voucher (so to speak) and the bank takes on a debt to you. That money allows them to create money out of thin air (fractional reserve banking) so when you take that money and put it into something that they can't get, of course they're not going to like it... that money disappears. He said he did a triple digit transaction so let's just spit out that the rate of fractions on that is 10 to 1.... [for every $100 you put in, there's $1000 net]( That's only 10%... and if he did a $999 transaction, that's $999 actual cash gone and an additional $9990 credit that the bank can no longer create out of thin air (which could be invested in the form of loans for up to 25ish% making them quite a lot of "money" for that original $999. Hell, yes, they're going to have a problem with this. 
If you want to deal with *real* money in a nonfractional nonreserve bank so that you don't have to deal with this, go to Free Lakota. Between that and bitcoin, you ought to be able to set up some seriously interesting stuff.

I know this is more of a question but why is credit/debit not a good way to get them?

Am I missing something or is that qr code for sending instead of receiving? 
@_date: 2015-02-10 12:29:40
And all you have to do is move it a couple times and then put it in an offline safe claiming that you already liquidated it.
@_date: 2015-02-14 22:16:08
That makes complete sense!Thanks

I'm not sure newegg is a good source of info about bitcoin until they start taking it as payment again.

Your problem is that you don't know how to talk to people so that they *want* to listen. Have you heard that old joke about two brothers getting dating advice? It goes like this:
A younger and older brother were talking about a girl in school that the younger brother likes. The younger brother is talking about how he doesn't know how to approach her.
"You go up to her and say something charming like 'When I saw you, time stood still. '"
The younger brother thinks on this for a minute and decides that he'll try it. He thinks his brother and leaves the room.
The next day the younger brother comes in and he has a blackeye. The older brother says "What happened what did you do? "
The younger brother looked at his older brother and said "I took your advice I did exactly what you said and she hit me. "
"What what did you say to her? "The older brother asked. 
The younger brother said "I looked her dead in the eye, smiled, and said you have a face that could stop a clock."
See, the problem with what you described is that you're coming off as an arrogant, powerless fool and deserve to thrown out on your ear. When you present a solvable problem to someone, especially in service situations like this, they will have a tendency to listen. I do this all the time and it works 100% of the time (with one exception where I had to involve lawyers but it was Time Warner and I still got what I wanted). You start off being an unassuming, non threatening customer. Strike up some pleasantry and always be respectful and smile... The don't get enough from customers with problems. Move into an explanation of the problem: "I have a bit of a problem here that's leaving a sour taste in my mouth. If we can come to a resolution, that will be awesome but if I walk out of here without a resolution we can both be comfortable with, my very next actions will be to close my account and file complaints and I will do both of those today."
See, now you have the person's attention. You have specified that there is a problem, you want a resolution, have shown that you're not there to cause a headache but you're not going to take no for an answer either. "No" means that you'll go to another solution that either forces them to do what you want or you will find another way to get what you want. 
Every time I use this approach (and I do mean without exception), I have their attention. They are instantly focused and are willing to listen without bias. All they know at this point is that there's a problem and you have attempted, on good faith, to open a dialog with them as an employee and as a person. Usually, when you have grounds to file a complaint and have your ducks in a row, if you file that complaint you will attach their name to it. 
In this process you have declared that that are people, that they have power, but *you* are in control and you've done it in a way that flatters them (by acknowledging their power).
The next step is to explain the circumstances without getting into details that caused the problem. You are establishing the legitimacy of your claim. 
Next, you ask if they still follow you. (The answer is usually yes at this point).  
When you get a yes, *then* you explain why there's a problem with what happened. 
I promise you, when you follow this approach, you will get more, better results than yours. If someone were to ever walk into my place of business doing what you described, I wouldn't even have security drag them out. I'd have them arrested after the first refusal to leave. Never walk into a situation mistaking arrogance for power; you'll lose every time.

Did ya see me say the word "again"? I did, I was there when I said it. When I posted that, they had had a way to accept bitcoin previously but then it wasn't there on my last order. While the cause of this was described by someone else, what I saw when I placed my order was a lack of an option to accept bitcoin followed by some research with people saying that they stopped because of funding issues. Sounded like incompetence. Not cult fanaticism but rather being guarded about my money. Nothing more.

Just tell them there was a crash and you lost everything. Understand that they will give you crap but that's okay because they're not asking you for money and then guilting you for not giving it to them.
