I'm fairly computer savvy, and I found it fairly difficult to buy bitcoin in the UK. There's just not that many places to buy it. For me it was one way too as I was just using it for donations and things like paying for VPNs.
I couldn't imaging the struggle trying to explain to someone how to receive and cash out the bitcoin.
I think you'd basically need a western union like service that used bitcoin to transfer and did all the work for people. You give them cash and you get cash back.
Then there's the volatility of bitcoin too, could be an issue.

So will it be possible to vote for them tomorrow? In what areas?

There's one thing I don't understand.
In my experience it takes at least ten mins for a transaction to be confirmed.
In this situation, or where people pay for drinks etc., do they have to just sit around for ten mins waiting for confirmation?

Interesting experiment, but something makes me uneasy about the way you've posted loads of girls' images, name and snippet of chat online.
I know it's tinder so kinda public anyway and there wouldn't really be any way to identify any of them, but just seems kinda like not respecting their privacy.

Yeah it's not really that big a deal. I mean the tinder profiles are semi public anyway.
Still interesting to see random people's reaction to bitcoin.
Would have expected less to know what it was, but I suppose the Silk Road news really brought it to the main stream.
I wonder what percentage just googled bitcoin before replying. I was looking at the time to respond as an indication, but can't tell really. Some of the responses  did seem like they just looked it up though.

What happened today?

Unless maybe you have some kind of vulnerability built into the RNG or implementation.

OK so you know what a hash function is? Oh ok well have you heard of cryptography? Oh ok, well a computer works with 1s and 0s...

This is actually possible I think, according to an article I read recently.
You can have a transaction which needs to be approved by multiple parties. The money stays in the buyer's account until 2/3, for example, of the parties approve it. One being the customer, one the vendor, and one the arbitrator.
