Yeah, I agree with you.. The momentum they had leading up to launch was almost to much for their own good = Disappointing first impression.. in saying that, we just need to give it time, i am sure the UX will improve.

I think the underlying real asset of BTC is blockchain. I think this will be a total game changer but BTC lacks historic intrinsic value. Why not have real money like gold on the blockchain?

Im a happy customer:) I have been a customer for 4-5 months now and  the experience has been great! I used to be a big believer in BTC and the decentralization of money but Im starting to learn now that without implemented KYC laws in BTC very serious criminal groups can use BTC as reserves to store there theft. With so much violence in the world right now I would not want to be holding all BTC. As they could quite easily halt the network to cut off major criminals supply. With BitGold (still decentralized aka personal gold standerd)  I know my money is safe as you can get real time audits on your allocated gold anytime. Plus it publicly traded audited by PriceWaterhouseCoopers, one of the largest auditing firms in the world.

If you don't think the government can shut down Bitcoin your may be in for a surprise.

I think KYC process must be conducted when it comes to money, so criminals can't use it as a loophole.. The exciting thing is that there are services that are decentrelized but have safe practises of not allowing criminals participate in the service. A company like BitGold who is reintroducing a personal gold standard I think leads the way for the future of money.

you make zero sense, its completely logical for a company to commence a clawback on referral bonus's if the the referral doesn't utilize the service... It was designed to serve family and friends that you engage with all the time.. I referred friends/family and most deposited because I introduced them to the platform and they saw the benefits = are now active members. (kept referral bonus)

totally agree, UX is is the most important thing to build around in tech companies. Killer user experience will increase the likely-hood of success.

I do not understand the highlighting of $100.00? They made it clear in t/c if your referrals did not deposit into the platform they would reclaim the promotional balances to their owned resources as an unclaimed promotion. The users you referred did not deposit and you probably mislead them saying "join here for free gold!" so yes this entire post is misleading. You never understood how the program functioned and if you did you would be an affiliate which was more designed for people to refer more users...

link for proof?

This is a misleading post... firstly, we should all be grateful for having a BitGold account in the first place, as if you actually understand the platform and the importance of gold for savings you would of protected yourself likely from the recent ripple of currency devaluations. I understand that it's disappointing getting a chargeback (which I did too btw) but it's totally understandable that the company reclaims referral bonuses if the party you refer doesn't deposit into the platform (it clearly states this 11.3 in t/c). It sounds like you didn't really understand the purpose of the Golden heart referral program, as for my understanding from the get-go the program was designed to refer your family and friends. If you did so, there is strong likelihood that your referrals would start utilizing the platform. (due to you educating family/friends). If you were hoping to make a business out of referring BitGold users you could've easily signed up for their affiliate program as this looks to be designed as more of a business-refferal program.

I love btc; but I think theirs an emergence of other underlying money's outside the banking system that could become the next big thing. For me anyway, the volatility in btc month over month is too dangerous to link all my time/effort too (accumulation of wealth) .. Take a look at [this page] ( this type of (outside the banking system) network looks revolutionary.  Thoughts?

If they did this and had an affirmative date I think btc would skyrocket... would be a massive influx to btc from the underground/people that want privacy still when conducting transactions.

This idiot was one of the leading economist at the IMF... he is one of the biggest names pushing this cashless society movement, he is a big name.... 
shows how toxic the system is when a guy with this much power thinks he can eliminate bitcoin. xD.....

This truly shows that when confidence fades in these paper notes we carry, paper notes erode in value.
with constant insanity via quantitative easing &amp; central bankers thinking they are 'magic people' read: ( i think it will happen sooner rather then later. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 20:02:43
Pretty disgusting what's going on right now, Central Bankers &amp; Academics are going to force people to participate in negative interest rates and could put an erupt end of other runs to money with a click of a button. Better prepare now!

“We do not define ourselves as left or right but rather as a party that focuses on the systems. In other words, we consider ourselves hackers – so to speak – of our current outdated systems of government.”
Exciting!

Incredible, these types of metrics are interesting. Shows the type of trend that is emerging. Are people starting to see the potential here? Must be all this looming chaos in financial markets.
