OMG... No way... I'm living just bairly above homeless right now I'm so broke. I can't even imagine that much $! Sure hope Polo will let me have it because I don't have any clue what password I used and no longer have access to that email account...

But would you have listened?  I'm the ONLY tech literate person anyone has ever met in this rural hicktown... so I took it upon myself to start preaching Bitcoin and cryptocurrency to anyone and everyone back when I was buying them at $30. They ALL said I was crazy and Bitcoin was laughable 'imaginary money'.  My ex-wife actually sued and took custody of our children claiming I had gone off the deep end for quitting my job and Mining full-time. She still insists it is fake money even today! Eventually I managed to convince just ONE person, my mom, to get like $200 out of pure pity...

Or Hashfast... Or MtGox... Or LTCGEAR... or all of the above, like I did. Trust me, better to miss out than to make a fortune only to lose it all + more! Mistakes are hard to live with....

Oh yeah it did didn't it?! I have an OLD Polo account I put 500 DRK into and forgot about it... I haven't bothered recovering it because I knew DRK was long gone... But, would that actually be 500 DASH now?!!?!!?

Seriously? Last time I looked, they didn't have a single user showing on even localbitcoins! Is there anywhere to actually spend BTC in Shreveport? How about those massive casino's?
Now, if I just had some way to know where to find this ATM... Like, some kind of street diagram thing... MAP! ... no? hmm.. LINK!! oh... Well, I could try the business name? Address? Latitude/Longitude? Really??? You just going to leave me guessing?
