I'm donating $500 in btc later today. It's a great organization and they are open to trying new applications in the Bitcoin world. We had a lot of success with Lighthouse.

Hi Jesset77, yes, if you do a search through the link you provided, the Albany chapter comes up (139 South Lake Avenue) when you input United States/New York.  I'm not sure why some of the chapters don't have their website listed.  I personally had a meeting with the executive director.
If you want to donate, you can go directly to this link:  
I'm donating any tips that I receive with the wallet address that I provided or through ChangeTip.  I'll be donating $500 in Bitcoin to the Ronald McDonald House of Albany regardless if we hit that number. :)

Thank you.  You can also tip me directly or utilize ChangeTip:
All tips will be sent to Ronald McDonald House of the Capital Region!

December 2nd is Giving Tuesday - the Black Friday of charities.  They were going to announce on that day, but figured they would get a head start.

AchillesUSA ... Looking forward to beta.

Directly to Ronald McDonald House?  I'll be in contact with them to show them how to redeem.  Thank you.

I understand.  You can always give them a buzz tomorrow if it makes you feel better - (518-438-2655) Thank you.

I only have a $1 from Reddit so far.  That's not a problem.  Either way, I'm donating $500 in Bitcoin to their amazing organization!  I will get an update in a few days from Ronald McDonald House &amp; BitPay to see how we are doing! :)

I'm part of the NY Bitcoin Group who set Ronald McDonald House of the Capital Region up to accept Bitcoin.  I'm matching up to $500 in Bitcoin donations from everywhere - not just Reddit!  Thank you everybody for your support!

Yes, Varoufakis is an attention whore and a hypocrite. I think he believes and enjoys Bitcoin, but turns around and jokes about it to mainstream. He was basically saying that Bitcoiners are a proud and happy bunch, but they live in their own world, their own small communities. I honestly stopped listening to him after that.

Thank you - donated!

Yes, give the Ronald McDonald House of Albany time to get situated and gain some experience with Bitcoin - then I recommend having your chapter give them a call for feedback.  If you need any support - paul  - Thank you!

Yes, it's a small community, but it's the way he comes across as a "bully" - like he's making fun of us. Nevertheless, he's got issues to deal with in Greece and should be focused on those.

The City of Troy would use BitPay, a merchant service provider, who freezes the volatility for 15 minutes. If it's $2500 in property taxes that the Bitcoin holder needs to pay then the City of Troy will receive exactly that. It gets converted instantly to US Dollars and deposited into the city's account. No fees.

He's got a lot on his plate with local issues, but is still finding time in the evening to learn about the technology as well as reading the news from our industry. Heck, he even has Breadwallet and Snapcard installed on his phone...and a ChangeTip account thanks to Victoria!

Thank you! I'm in meetings the next few hours and will match as soon as I get back along with any other pledges!
