That is assuming the dummy would not serve its purpose.
@_date: 2016-08-06 23:47:56
Having all the 24 words will not be enough for the attacker to know the correct combination for your seed. The attacker would have to test all the possible iterations (24!, minus invalid seeds due to checksum) and hash them using SHA-512. This means that it would take an immense computing power to get to your private key from  the 24 seed words out-of-order.
Of course, the safest solution would be running the recovery on a newly installed system, but even on a compromised computer, this recovery method will protect your private key.

You can double check the address with another device, like your phone (reading the same email, for instance).
This is advisable especially when sending a large amount of money.

Yes, you can verify the code running on the device. You can compare the firmware built by trezor against the firmware you build yourself from source.

You can compile it yourself and flash it yourself.
@_date: 2018-09-05 14:31:26
For security reasons, there is always a small chance that Trezor erases its storage during an update. For such cases, you have your recovery seed, generated for you when your first set up the device/wallet. If you keep this recovery seed safe and have it during updates, there is nothing to worry about.
@_date: 2017-12-27 00:13:24
Yeah, I've been talking about trezor :)) no worries, lost in the context.
Trezor wipes its memory and displays a warning on every start when the firmware is not signed by the vendor, but lets you run the code at your own risk.
SE can give you a feeling of security, because it hides its data everyone but itself. Of course, then it has certifications etc. But in the end, it is security by obscurity, while trezor prefers security by open source. Also, certifications don't necessarily mean *secure*, as we have witness from the recent Infineon chip case and or other previous secure chips vulnerabilities.
Anyway, as you say, it is up to individual preference. It's a free market.

Fair enough with the UN terminology, though some might not agree with it. I think that especially in the eastern part of the country, many will object to "Česko/Czechia" as a geographical term, and will consider it more as a political term.

In any case, off topic :)

@_date: 2017-02-28 12:01:49
TREZOR prides itself in the fact that it can be used on a infected computer as well, without security loss to you. The only thing you need to make sure is that the address you are sending your coins to is the correct one. (There are malwares that can potentially switch addresses, thereby stealing your coins.)
Every single operation on TREZOR has to be approved by you, on the device itself. The computer has no control over that and cannot "force" TREZOR to do things without your knowledge.
More information on this is available in our documentation: 
@_date: 2017-02-27 09:37:49
It definitely appears that the firmware got corrupted. As suggested by someone in this thread too, double-click the buttons when plugging in the TREZOR to start it in bootloader-mode. Then open wallet.trezor.io to initiate firmware update.
This will most likely wipe your device though, so have your backup ready.
@_date: 2017-02-14 12:45:09
No, it's an older feature.
Since Keepkey just copies TREZOR's code, I would sincerely doubt that they have implemented BIP39 Passphrase support before TREZOR.

When crossing borders, or in general even, you can just disable the passphrase encryption feature in TREZOR Wallet, Advanced Settings. Then it will look like you never had passphrase encrypted wallets in the first place. The hidden wallets will not go away, they will just be inaccessible from the GUI.
When in need of using them, enable again and use them again.

TREZOR should validate the checksum, so it should reject a non-valid seed
@_date: 2017-02-22 14:29:23
You can always generate your own master key, transform it into a 12 or 24 word seed and then import it into TREZOR via Recovery.
Though, to address your concerns with master key/seed generation, stick, our developer described the process here (entropy source, etc.) 
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:02:12
Just tested, TREZOR generates the same address as iancoleman/bip39, bip32.org, electrum. (TREZOR does all the priv key deriations by itself, inside the device, not relying on third parties.)

KeepKey uses Trezors code. The entire software is taken from trezors open source. So basically the difference is the form factor.
And then it's entirely up to you who do you want to support.
Also, I'm sure that if you purchase trezor from the eShop, [shop.trezor.io]( the price is definitely not $300 for one trezor.
@_date: 2017-02-20 12:51:57
Not your keys, not your coins. Online, custodial wallet services are basically just IOUs, promising to pay you on request. But what if they go offline or close down? You won't be able to recover your coins.
afaik, these services are not insured either, so it's not like a bank, which you can *partly trust.* If it closes down, your money is gone.
Not to mention the KYC/AML rules would require them to identify you, making it easy to track money flow to your identity.
@_date: 2017-02-07 13:19:24
No, the last word (24th) should be the checksum. It verifies that the previous 23 are correct and in a right order.
When you restored the seed into TREZOR, did it open a wallet or did it show an error?
@_date: 2017-03-07 09:02:33
You realize he's not the first one to do that, right.
@_date: 2017-02-23 08:11:58
TREZOR is not affected. The device does all the private key derivations by itself (using a third party would be insecure, and beats the purpose of TREZOR).

Just reposting my answer from ------------------
First of all, sorry you feel this way, I understand that this is a serious issue, especially due to the backorder, but let me try to explain the rationale behind this refund policy.
The value of the product is stated in US dollars, and therefore what you are being charged is the BTC equivalent of US dollars at the time of purchase. Consequently, when you apply for the refund, the USD value of the product is converted to BTC, which is then paid out to you. With a currency as volatile as BTC, it is very possible that the two BTC values will not match. 
If we were to refund you the BTC value at the time of purchase, irrespective of how the exchange rate moved, then it is quite possible that we would end up paying you more in USD value. Imagine this situation: Someone buys a TREZOR but overnight the BTC price goes up by 50%. That person could then ask for a refund, get the full refund in BTC and then purchase TREZOR again "50% off". This puts us at speculative risk.
In an optimal case scenario, TREZOR would be priced in BTC. Then refunds and payments would be more straightforward, without the need to apply the "exchange rate rule". As BTC is volatile, I can imagine that this would jack up the price of TREZOR by quite a lot. As the value of BTC goes up, so would the price for TREZOR and hence the device needs to be valued in USD.
Needless to say this exchange rate rule/policy works both ways, it just depends on how the exchange rate moves: If you purchased TREZOR for $99 at 0.099 BTC and suddenly the exchange rate would drop from 1BTC=$1000 to, say, 1BTC = $500, then we would pay you more in BTC than what you have paid us (we'd have to pay out 0.198 BTC). 
_________________________ 
To conclude, despite of how much I hate these kinds of arguments, still I'd like to mention that we are not the only ones that use this rule. If you have a credit card in Euro and buy something in the US, then ask for a refund, the merchant will refund you the US value, not taking into account the exchange rate change. Closer to the bitcoin community, Expedia's bitcoin rules are the same as ours, protecting the company against exchange rate movements.
This policy is in no way designed to steal money from our customers.

That figure you quoted is the amount of SHA-512 operations needed to be run to cycle through all combinations of a 24 word seed. 
The actual number of 24-word seed combinations is 24! ÷ 256, which is around 2,423,626,569,270,466,560,000 as has said :)

@_date: 2017-03-09 09:37:52
TREZOR does **not** rely on the PC to generate they key. It generates the keys itself, giving you the seed only once for backup, during the setup.
You might be confused because of where the entropy comes from. Part of it is generated on the device (hardware random number generator) and part of it is taken from the computer. These are then **mixed together**, to provide a stronger entropy. Mixing also means that even if the entropy from the computer was weak, the result of the mixing would still be strong, as entropy always increases.

Trezor is safe against the mining fee attack, that article's quote of is not entirely clear.




However, this does not mean that HW wallets like Trezor do not already do that. This is actually the reason why some Trezor transactions take so long to calculate: the device is hashing all the inputs to verify the values. 
The comment about viability stands in support of SegWit: this lengthy process is incredibly inefficient and SegWit would resolve this. It is not true that Trezor ignores this attack vector.

The PIN that shows up on the TREZOR screen is not actually a PIN. It is just the layout of the PIN pad displayed on your computer screen when you plug in your TREZOR.
So, if you choose your PIN to be 4839, you will press the appropriate buttons on your computer screen, according to the layout given to you by the TREZOR.
Of course, you should choose your own PIN -- this grants you physical security

Initially we planned to release full BCH support in the Wallet, but bugs in the code forced us not to. The guide was only amended to reflect that development, allowing you to send BCH elsewhere. When the BCH support is fixed and released, the title will make more sense :)

Yes, the device erases its storage if firmware without a valid signature is installed. This is happening correctly in all FW versions.

Unfortunately deleted, I tried to have a look.
But even with a database of serial numbers, this could be created at the time of manufacturing and wouldn't require the device serial number to be logged, just looked up.

I was gonna accept this comment as a subjective point of view of a satisfied customer (which is alright), but really? Better seed?
All popular hardware wallets use the same standard for seed generation.

Most if not all hardware wallets are backed up with a 24-word mnemonic (BIP32/39/44). You can restore your entire wallet on any compatible wallet (software or hardware).

How hardware wallets work: HW wallets like trezor safeguard your private (secret) keys with which you sign your transactions (like an order). Every process of signing is done on the device, so there is no danger that someone can steal your keys and order the bitcoins to be sent to his/her address.
Main security concern: what if SatoshiLabs goes rogue and codes a new firmware to steal users' coins. Well, the code is open source, everyone can see what is being built. There are also ways how to check if the build that is officially offered by Satoshilabs is actually based on the publicly published code.
In any case, if someone at SL wanted to steal your coins from your device, and let's say the official FW was modified in that way... Then you would still have to update your Trezor to that FW first, before SL would be able to steal your coins. With people suddenly noticing their coins gone, word would spread fast in order to dissuade people from updating their FW.
So, for long term holding, Trezor is absolutely safe. No one can touch or spend your coins if the Trezor is not plugged in and you haven't approved any transactions.
@_date: 2017-01-09 13:44:10
I store my main stash protected by a passphrase. You can also divide it into many different passphrases, but that does not really solve your problem with remembering the passphrase.
One idea I had recently was to take the first few words from your favorite book as the passphrase. Like one wallet, first word of the first chapter, second wallet - first two words of the second chapter. You can be creative. You just need to remember the book and the pattern, which is imho easier than remembering a bunch of passphrases.
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:45:51
It is definitely an odd way how to release an alleged hack.
First, they describe a fixed vulnerability.
Second, they skip certain parts of the process.
Third, they mention Defcon, which is unrelated to this vulnerability.
Fourth, they claim that 15 seconds is enough.
Fifth, they provide no video, only photos.
Sixth, you need to pay in order to verify their claims.
If there is really such a hack, then they could have contacted us (we have Responsible Disclosure and a reward system).

Not sure why you had to look up your email, as you do not need to have an email to start using TREZOR. You only need it for order and delivery, but not for the actual use of the device. There is no sign up or registration to use the device.


SatoshiLabs is not a US company, not under the Federal jurisdiction. We are based in the Czech Republic; data protected by Czech and EU Privacy Laws.
But that does not really matter. This is only shipping information and if the government wants it, they can request it from the shipping companies too. The essentials, like serial number that could associate the TREZOR to you, your address, are not recorder or tracked. We do not know which TREZOR, with what serial number, was delivered to you. Device ID is reset each time you reset your TREZOR. Either way, **we do not log any of these numbers**.
Basically, there is no way to associate a specific TREZOR to an individual or mailing address.

Update to 1.5.2 and you don't need a passphrase.
But having a passphrase will increase the physical security of your TREZOR significantly. It also allows you to have plausible deniability. If you are comfortable with how it works, there is no reason not to have it.
@_date: 2017-01-15 20:41:21
That is odd, because you are not ever required to update your FW in order to use TREZOR Wallet.

What do you mean by our posture? We have released a fix before the first article surfaced. Moreover, the first article combined correct info (the actual vulnerability) with misleading info (such as 1.5.2 is also vulnerable -- it isn't) and therefore we considered it as FUD. 
It's actually a pretty smart way of spreading FUD, to give it apparent legitimacy by incorporating true claims, and spread false claims.

He/she is not restoring the seed.
Besides it is entered in a random order, so even on a computer compromised by a keylogger, the seed will still have to be cracked (the difficulty is around 24! I think). Of course, you should avoid this if you are more security minded -- after recovery move your funds to a new seed.
(Or restore using Android. We are working on advanced recovery methods that would not expose the seed, ETA soon)

If, by any chance, you flash an unofficial firmware on your TREZOR, the device will wipe your seed so that the unofficial FW (not always malicious, depends on whom you trust) cannot read your seed.
If you then plug the device in, TREZOR will warn you that you are about to use unofficial FW. It will always do this at start.
Bootloader is non-flashable.
@_date: 2017-01-25 23:05:11
The seed is restored in a shuffled order, so even with a keylogger it is still difficult to guess the correct order.
We are introducing a new, advanced recovery mode, with which you won't need to enter whole words on your computer anymore, to be released soon-ish.

Unconfirmed transactions are unreliable by design.
Currently, due to the large size of the unconfirmed transactions in the Bitcoin network, it is possible that not all of them will fit into the memory of relaying nodes immediately.
It is an inherent technical issue of Bitcoin. For instance, the transaction can get temporarily "lost" on its way in some node (generally happens to low fee txs) and therefore it will not propagate to our servers. Hence, the transaction will not show up in TREZOR Wallet right away (this applies for txs sent into TREZOR).
Once these transactions are confirmed by the network, they will show up in the Wallet again.
If the issue persists, our support team will take care of you. Just contact us at support

It is protected by a PIN, which has an exponentially increasing counter for wrong tries, giving you enough time to recover your wallet with your seed elsewhere and move your coins to a safe wallet.


In this case, you should initialize your TREZOR with a Passphrase, which acts similarly to a 25th seed word. Your wallet keys will be deterministically generated from the 24-word seeds plus the passphrase. As the passphrase is only stored in your brain, and everywhere else you choose to write it down/store it, it is impossible to retrieve it from the device.


Paper wallets are not convenient to be used, as you always have to send your coins to a new one, if you wish to use them. With TREZOR, you will need a paper backup, but it should not be used unless you need to recover your wallet. You can just conveniently and securely spend coins with the hw device.
@_date: 2017-01-13 15:23:12
Why wouldn't you recommend using TREZOR Wallet?
@_date: 2017-01-03 11:37:51
You can externally initialize Trezor, just supply it with a 24-word seed, which was generated elsewhere

With TREZOR, your private keys never touch the internet (those keys are needed to sign your transactions). They are generated and isolated to the device. Every process using the keys is done on the TREZOR, only the result is sent back to the computer.
This isolated environment makes it a safer storage for your coins.

No. PIN provides low entropy for encryption, it would be easily crackable. Added complexity for no increase in security.


No. See above.


No. Cracking hashes for PIN could happen fairly quickly. Where would you store the salt?


No. There is no such function in the hardware or official software of the device. Not the memory, nor the storage can be dumped by connecting two pins.

Your keys are derived from the 24 words. When a new currency is added, TREZOR generates keys for that new currency, with a different derivation path, specific for that currency (SLIP44). This means that the 24 words are future proof.
For instance, bitcoin keys are generated with the coin type 0. Litecoin has coin type 2. By using different coin types, the keys won't overlap and you can always add another coin type and generate new keys.

For some, it is actually a question of more than just a minute. Transactions with many small inputs can take as long as 10-30 min to sign.

@_date: 2016-11-25 11:26:22
Hardware wallets are as safer than paper wallets, because they give you an additional protection layer (such as pin and passphrase). They're also more convenient to spend from. Spending out of a paper wallet is actually quite insecure as you have to import your private keys somewhere, but if you want to hodl, you probably don't really care as much about this.
 What you might care about though, is that even with a hardware wallet, you can import your XPUB into mycelium and have a watch-only mode on your phone. You can still accept coins through mycelium, but to send it, you'll have to connect your hardware wallet into your phone. This is because your private keys will be stored in your hardware wallet only.
Now, which wallet? I work for SatoshiLabs so I will obviously recommend TREZOR :) $20 with blackfriday16 code right now
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:26:15
Thanks for the feedback. I mean it, it is always helpful.
The only reason why I labeled it as FUD was because of the misinformation in the post, written alongside of legitimate information. If the post only referred to the valid information and stated that the vulnerability was fixed in 1.5.2, we could have even linked that post from our blog as an independent source.
On the contrary though, he stated that even 1.5.2 was vulnerable to this attack, which is, respectfully, very misleading, and we had to defend against it.
@_date: 2017-01-16 10:34:48
Exactly, just one clarification:


Yes, the serial number is queried only in bootloader mode, but it is not logged anywhere.

*Disclaimer: Work for SatoshiLabs which makes TREZOR*
You won't have any problems moving your funds from anywhere to TREZOR. It works like any other wallet, with a difference that it stores your private keys securely: isolated and offline. Computations using the private key is also isolated.

Unless you've sent them to a wrong address/malware-changed address, then don't worry, the transaction is just stuck in the mempool (quite a lot of transactions waiting, actually). Since the transaction was displayed in myTREZOR at the beginning as unconfirmed, I think it's more likely to be stuck due to low fees.

When we were considering what the label would be, the reason for choosing Bcash at first was to avoid cases where new users might think it is the real Bitcoin. This was our only intention, despite of all the theories that we were guided by someone.
There was a sizable opposition to this label, despite of its merits as a shorthand. I assume this is due to the perception that it is offensive. While I personally don't see why it should be so offensive, we had to take this into account when deciding to relabel the coin in TREZOR.
Even before the poll was manipulated, the division of votes was roughly 60-40 for Bcash. So, on one hand there is a majority which presumably does not want the name to be confusing and on the other hand, a sizable minority which really wants the "real name". 
So we came up with a compromise. The name would be changed to Bitcoin Cash, according to the minority, and there would be warning in the BCH wallet that it is not a bitcoin Wallet, resolving the worries of the majority. I think that this is an okay result, since a tyranny of the majority is not always a good solution, especially if it is about a currency that the majority might not use (while the minority would).

Spain doesn't have a national currency though. But you are right that they can find a way how to limit the ability of their citizens to withdraw money, enforced by banks (like it happened in Greece). 
In the long run though, capital controls in a single country, which is in the eurozone, are unsustainable (unless they are applicable throughout the eurozone). People would either switch to cryptocurrencies, but there is still a steep learning curve to bitcoin. It is much easier to just open a bank account in a neighboring country. /OT
This limit to €1000 is just enforced so that people would use cashless transactions. In Europe, with a large population that has access to banks, this will not cause the same problem like the abolishing of some bills in India. The government probably just wants to have a better oversight (read: surveillance ) over what people use their money on. Also, the argument can be: limit tax evasion and corruption. Either way, I don't think this will drive people to bitcoin. Not in Europe, where people are *used* to banks.
(My two cents, feel free to convince me otherwise)

A lot of people only read the title. So it's important not to be misleading when writing one. Saying that "it's clarified in the text or this other article" just sounds like an excuse, honestly.
Moreover, it's quite easy to make this concrete title factually correct. Just remove the comma between "open source" and "multi apps."

@_date: 2016-12-09 12:41:28
If I understood you correctly, here is what you will need to do:
Initialize all 4 Trezors and write down all 4 sets of recovery seeds (24 words each) and set up their PIN. Grab one address from each and then use your Trezor to send the coins to those addresses (4 in total). Now the 4 Trezors will have funds on them. (No need to go through an exchange.)
The tricky part comes now. How to make sure that your kin will safely receive the Trezors, PIN and the seeds. One way I can see it working out is to put a Trezor, its PIN and its seed into a box and seal it (= 4 separate boxes). It must have some kind of a seal, which will break upon opening, but then again, its very easy to fake a seal. Alternatively, number the Trezors and write a letter where in which you will leave the seeds and the PIN for the Trezor, and store separately, sealed. There are many ways how to do this.
Keep in mind though that whoever gets the seed will get to the funds. They will not need a Trezor to access the coins -- the seed is the most important part so secure it adequately. (Private keys used to sign transactions are derived from the seed. Signing transactions == sending money.)
There is a more advanced option though, and you should only do this if you are comfortable with it. It is, imho, more secure. Using CoPay, create a shared wallet, where you will put all your bitcoins. The trick here is that in order to spend those bitcoins, a number of members of the wallet will have to agree on it (co-sign it). The number will be set by you when you create the wallet. Let's say you will create a shared wallet from 5 Trezors, and will require the signature of 4 to successfully send a transaction. Then your kin will have to all agree to equally distribute your funds, which ascertains that your money will be divided according to your wishes. Of course, this assumes that they will understand the way bitcoin transactions work. (Downside to this is that if two will refuse to co-sign, then the money will never be divided... requires at least 4 signatures.)
Check out how CoPay works with TREZOR here:  and a general overlook at multisig by copay:

Imho, I'd recommend using an offline android phone with sideloaded Trezor manager app from Github as the safest way of recovery 
@_date: 2016-12-16 12:13:39
You can always restore your wallet with your seed, that is correct. In fact, anyone with the access to your seed can, so you need to protect it well.
Mycelium &amp; Copay, or any other mobile app, cannot be compared to hardware wallets like Trezor (or others). Mobile phones and OS are not specifically designed to counter bitcoin threats. They are complex, multipurpose OS's. Phones have a myriad of fixed and unfixed vulnerabilities, some of which we might not even know of. (Mobile phones are basically computers: they face the same threats.)
On the other hand, hardware wallets are designed to be as secure as possible, by being as simple as possible; and they do one thing only -- work with asymmetric keys. The surface of attack is thus minimized (no rogue app to steal your data). Not to mention that you cannot get the seed/private keys out of the hw wallets.
@_date: 2016-12-22 12:28:27
That's not true though. Most of the hardware wallets are backed up with a 24-seed (paper back, sort of), that you should store somewhere safely and only use if the device is lost/broken.

@_date: 2016-11-22 16:04:37


No, that is quite misleading. TREZOR uses a normal microcontroller, because only then we can open source all the code, in order to make it reviewable by independent experts and auditors. You cannot do this with a secure element. Passphrase is an additional protection, first you enter PIN, which is shuffled. Cracking the PIN would take both a lot of time and effort.
If it is so easy for someone skilled to read data from TREZOR, why has there not been a single case of bitcoins going missing/being stolen from TREZOR? Because it is not that simple. Yes, there were some ways how to attack the TREZOR using a side-channel, but these were fixed as soon as they were discovered. Again, to reiterate, not a single bitcoin has been stolen from TREZOR.


If there are people who know about bitcoin and hardware wallets, and have the intent of stealing it/them from you, then  it does not really matter if you have Nano S or TREZOR. They are both well known enough, so a thief would recognize either of them. Also who plugs in a USB pendrive with a cable? 
@_date: 2016-12-16 15:41:44
It may sound easy, but it is quite difficult to redesign an app with so many features.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:32:40
TREZOR does not reveal the seed to the computer upon set up. 
During recovery you enter the seed in a random order, but you can do that on a air gapped Android device, only used for that purpose. Either way, we are working on a new on-device recovery. Should be out in the next release.
I work for SatoshiLabs so I'll be biased about the recommendation ;) Keepkey uses a lot of TREZORs code, so there is a bit of an overlap when it comes to functionality, but only TREZOR has U2F (out of the two). Also (imho), TREZOR is smaller, better storable and more environment durable.

Working for Trezor and if I can suggest anything, get a hardware wallet (with a display).
An idea about encrypted flash drive was thrown around here, but I'd say it's not very secure. Especially if you want to spend your Bitcoins, it's gonna be more difficult to keep it secure compared to a dedicated hardware wallet. 
HW wallets are both safe and convenient to use, designed specifically for this purpose. They're are constantly developed and updated to keep your coins secure. On the other hand, with an RPI, you're gonna be responsible for maintaining the wallet. If you don't trust hw wallet producers, this is the best way to go. If you trust hw wallets, then you might as well depend on them.

Speaking for TREZOR here (Disclaimer: I work for SatoshiLabs).
If you are worried about the OG TREZOR being dated then don't, it is not ;) It will continue to be updated and maintained alongside with the v2. Another point is that we don't know yet when the v2 will be ready, so it might still be a wait.
Apart from the above, the TREZOR is also quite future proof thanks to its customizable firmware. There are developers out there adding more and more features every day, such as SSH, GPG and FIDO/U2F. Some of these are then implemented into the official firmware, if they pass quality and security checks. That is without mentioning altcoin support, such as LTC, DASH, ETH and ZCash, which is also continuously expanding.

You can turn that argument against Ledger and SE too, why has noone hacked a SE yet? Because there are easier/cheaper ways how to steal money.

If you wanna be certain that your seed is secure, use it only on one device/wallet app at one time (of course, keep a seed backup written somewhere, like in your cryptosteel). So yes, you should move your funds to a wallet on a new master seed. 
You do not need to move the funds to a new mycelium wallet though. Just wipe your Trezor, then set up a new seed, and then move your funds from mycelium.
If you want to have a overview of your wallet balance on your phone, that is still possible. You can just import the XPUB from Trezor into mycelium. When you want to spend your funds, all you need is to plug Trezor into your phone with an OTG cable and use it normally.

Hi, I work for TREZOR, and obviously, I can't recommend it enough.
But I would rather react to point four. It is always important to think about the worst possibilities. I solved it by giving a copy of the TREZOR to my partner, but it is not always a good idea for everyone.
Another option is to give your partner a copy of your TREZOR (the device with the same seed), but use [additional passphrase protection]( which would be necessary to access your wallet. This passphrase could then be written into your will. Without the recovery seed AND the will at the same time, no one would be able to access your money.
Or you can get other ideas from the community here. I would recommend reading [this article]( by Pamela Morgan first though.

Hi, I'm that guy!


That's not a bug, it's a feature. The logic behind TREZOR and other hardware wallets is that you do not want to have your signing device constantly connected to the internet. You only connect when you use it, so that no nasty things can occur in behind your back.
Sure, you can turn the phone off and on, but in general, phones have lower security than crypto-tailored hardware wallets.


So can you with TREZOR. Just plug it into your phone with Mycelium. [Here is how. (blog.trezor.io)](

For security reasons, there is no way how to access the funds on your TREZOR, if you do not have the PIN or Recovery Seed. Otherwise, this would beat the purpose of having the TREZOR in the first place.
@_date: 2017-04-18 14:14:14
If I am correct, you can do the same with Ledger.
If you do not have an OTG cable, you can always just import the XPUB manually. Follow the guide, but instead of choosing TREZOR, choose Scan (Bitcoin Address) and scan your XPUB.
@_date: 2016-09-20 11:44:00

@_date: 2016-09-19 11:33:02
Encrypted thumbdrive? Good, only until you need to use the private key, because then you'd need to decrypt the drive and your computer would need to calculate the operation using the private key. This means that the attacker could have already hacked your computer and is only waiting for the key to be used by the computer (and thus be able to copy the key).
Trezor is not just storage, it actually does these calculations, using the private key stored. Instead of the key being used on a possibly compromised computer, the operation is isolated to the Trezor. This minimizes the chances of the key going into the wrong hands. Trezor only returns the output of these calculations/operations.
Trezor also lets you control all the operations on the device, through its buttons. On a computer, with an encrypted thumbdrive, a hidden program could run on the background, using the key from the drive after decryption. This is not really possible with Trezor, as you would have to knowingly approve the operation.
@_date: 2016-09-15 21:04:22

If Dridex gets control of the computer, it could possibly steal databases and keys of the local software wallets. But users of all kinds of wallets should be cautious, because:




It seems like Dridex could inject a specific bitcoin address instead of the real addresses a user would want to send bitcoins to (on websites, payment links, etc.) The user would then send the transaction to that address, thinking it would be the correct one. A good practice would be always double-checking the destination address with your phone, or on another computer. Otherwise, I can't see how Dridex could attack hardware wallets.

Well, storing your private key in a USB drive is unsafe, because anyone can read and access the USB drive. On of the differences with Trezor is that the Trezor keeps the key encrypted and safe. 
How? The key is only used by Trezor, for operations run inside the Trezor, and only after the user physically confirms the operation. Therefore, the key never leaves Trezor.
As for the BTC, they always "remain" online. There is actually no money ever stored in BTC wallets. What you're essentially keeping in your wallet is the private key that approves the transactions, and without which it is not possible for the coins to move. So even if the site is hacked, your BTCs are safe, because they will not have the private key (it's on the Trezor!).

You can generate your own seed, if you do not trust Trezor's randomness, and then enter it into Trezor via the recovery procedure. As others have pointed out, this tool is the best for this procedure, and can be run offline: 
I am not aware of any tools that let you choose your own seed, but I don't see why there shouldn't be any. Of course, there is the checksum though. When it comes to randomness, a computer beats human, so letting a computer do it would be safer, but I can understand why would you wanna choose your own.
When recovering Trezor, you can run it offline, by using python-trezor. Alternatively, you can wipe your android device clean, go offline, sideload Trezor Manager apk from GitHub (or build your own), and recover/enter your seed through that way.

Think of it this way. Trezor is your car key, and the web wallet is your car. You need your key to start your car, you need the Trezor to send your bitcoins. (The metaphor kinda ends here.) 
The web wallet communicates with the bitcoin network, in order to send the transaction, but it will not do that, unless you approve it with your Trezor. The difference between online and hardware wallets is that your private key, with which you sign the transaction, remains on Trezor and never leaves it. This is also concerning your third point: With online wallets you store your private key on the server. Not only do you need to trust the server, but you also have to believe that it will never be hacked (which is silly to believe). 




As already described, you can back up the wallet by saving the mnemonic backup seed somewhere safely. You can find a bit more about the seed here:

It also has been fixed, even before the first article was released, so that also erases the risk.

Make sure the seed is securely stored and do not make a digital copy of it. Do **not** send it, even if encrypted, over the internet.
You can make an identical copy of the entire wallet by recovering the seed on the second TREZOR. Since I have just recommended not to send the seed over the internet, you will have to visit him to get the seed anyway. It is therefore just simpler to send to the coins into a newly initialized TREZOR.
I can't stress enough how important it is to write down and safeguard the recovery seed (and passphrase if used). If you forget the device PIN, you can always recover the entire wallet with the recovery seed. But if someone steals your recovery seed, they can basically access your entire wallet.
Do some research and make sure you understand how TREZOR works. Don't use advanced features, such as passphrase, unless you are absolutely sure how they work. Here are some TREZOR resources and guides:  , you can take your time to browse through the [documentation]( too. It is a lot of money so better safe than sorry.

Feedback: Can you use a more legitimate source for the physical memory access issue than that misleading article (first link)? You can use the [official source]( or an alternative [technical write up]( by an independent developer. No need to use an article, which is sensationalist and borderline FUD (due to inaccuracies).
And related to the second link in the article, it also contains some severe inaccuracies. For instance, you cannot dump the memory of a TREZOR device and you cannot flash the bootloader of the device. You also cannot bypass the PIN entry, as the article suggests. These factors alone should prove to you that the article is baseless.
Regarding the content of your article, I am sorry that you have had that experience. Our Support Team answers queries as soon as possible, but due to high demand, the wait-time for the first answer could be 48 hours (from last message). 
To answer your question about the return policy, we accept unopened packages returned within 15 days from the delivery date. (In other words, if you received the TREZOR on the 1st day of the month, then you have up until the 15th to ship it back.) If it has been already opened, the refund is still issued, but not the full value (the 15 days requirement still holds). 
For malfunctioning devices, the refund conditions do not apply. Instead, you can open warranty claim (2 years warranty). To verify the claim, we test the devices on our computers after they are sent to us. If they work, they are not broken, and therefore the warranty claim is unsubstantiated. If they are indeed malfunctioning, we replace them or offer a full refund.

Yeah, I do and we have an UX team always looking for improvements so I would like to help them with anything I can.


It is, and it has not received many visible updates because we are preparing an entirely different version of the Wallet. A better one :)


Updates are stressful, I agree, but that's because of the security architecture of the device. You need to first start the device in the bootloader mode, because the bootloader needs to write the firmware and then check the signature of the firmware. If the signature is incorrect, then your data will be wiped, making sure a malicious firmware won't be able to steal your seed/master key. This means that your data will also be erased, if anything wrong happens during the update process -- a classic security-usability tradeoff.


We are also working on improving the onboarding process.

TREZOR is actually open source (HW&amp;SW)
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:42:17
Hardware wallets run operations with private keys exclusively on the device, without leaking your keys.
 HW wallets like TREZOR only use the host computer for the UI/interface and network connection.
In contrast, an encrypted USB drive would leak its content to the host computer whenever it is used (decrypted) and apps on it ran. Similarly to a paper wallet -- you need an actual host computer to run the operations with the private key.
@_date: 2017-10-23 21:54:45
I will still say it, security by obscurity does not always work. We believe that open source will let the community audit our code, put it under greater scrutiny to see what is actually going on.
Moreover, Common Criteria and FIPS did not really make Infineon chips secure. 
@_date: 2019-09-20 14:28:06
Bad idea. Don't trust anyone that easily with your savings.
I'd recommend getting a spare Trezor and recovering your seed into it. Any mobile, web, or computer app will compromise the security of your recovery seed and if someone obtains access to your connected devices, they can get access to your bitcoins.
*Full disclaimer: I work for Trezor.*

Except that TREZOR Wallet (web interface) won't run unless the device runs a firmware version with the fix.

No, U2F uses public-key cryptography, similarly to Bitcoin. In other words, your public key can be exposed without danger to your private key.
A bit more detail: When you register U2F, you send the server your public key. When you try to log in, the server will send you a challenge, which the device signs using the private key in the device. The server gets the signed challenge and verifies with the registered public key that it is indeed you. This way, the private key is never exposed to the server.
TREZOR also uses different key-pairs for U2F than for Bitcoin or other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-10-24 08:23:32
Infineon secure chips have been found to have weaknesses before (2010). Also, secure chips are worthless if the implementation is faulty, like was in the case of PS3.
Open source implementation can limit or decrease these implementation faults from happening, namely due to the increased scrutiny of the code.

By doing this, you have compromised your seed. The TREZOR seed, while compatible with those apps, should not be entered anywhere else but the TREZOR. If your TREZOR breaks or is lost, then you should restore it in those apps, for example, but not pre-emptively.
Essentially, by typing your seed into Mycellium, anyone with access to your phone can steal your coins out of your TREZOR.


Your coins are probably in the new account, which supports SegWit. Mycelium does not support SegWit yet.

First of all, I'd recommend moving your coins from coinbase anyway, as offline key wallet is always safer than online key wallet (remember: if you don't own the keys, you don't own the money). 
Trezor will be maintained and should always work (support won't be discontinued with the release of the next generation). You can even run your own myTrezor instance, Bitcore server or connect it to a third party wallet to get to your coins, in case the world ends and our servers stop running. Trezor also does not need to be updated, unless it is a security patch. On the other hand, talking in 10+ years is a bit too far. 
I would be okay with putting Bitcoins on the Trezor for a long time, but I'd check the news on the device every year at least, maybe twice a year. 
But definitely, store the seed safely too.

Calling people idiots and inferior will cause the exact opposite, i.e. they will not look into the actual issue but instead focus on ad hominems. You are shifting the focus of the debate on insults instead of the development.


Not everything needs PR to be used, I agree. On the other hand, if you cover it in *bad* PR and call dissenters stupid, then you won't really impress them, no matter how great the code is. Right now BU people are in minority, so you might think it's not a big issue, but who knows.

@_date: 2017-05-03 14:09:31
The recovery seed is your "master key" in easily rememberable 24 random words in a specific order.
So when you recover your TREZOR, the device takes the seed words (wordlist: BIP39) and converts them into a master key. From this master key, your keys to all currencies and accounts are derived (hiearchy: BIP32), as defined by BIP44.
This means that for recovery, you really only need those 24 words, as everything else is derived from them :) 
@_date: 2017-05-10 10:03:28
Your recovery seed is composed of 24 words. When you recover your wallet, you use this seed, which will recreate the exact same wallet on your new TREZOR.
With passphrase enabled, your wallet is created from a total of 25 words: 24-word seed AND your passphrase. 
This means that if you stored your bitcoins on your TREZOR **with passphrase enabled**, you will need to enable passphrase in the newly recovered TREZOR too. If you only restore from the seed and without the passphrase, you will get an empty wallet.
(You do not need to do this during the recovery process though, you can always enable passphrase protection later in the device settings and use the same passphrase as on the old device to access your coins.)

@_date: 2017-05-24 22:14:10
A hardware wallet with a display on which you can confirm transactions is definitely the best way you can go. I'd recommend TREZOR, not only because I work for it :)
When you use a hardware wallet, you should always have the recovery seed (12-24 words) stored somewhere safely, in case your device breaks or is lost. Then you can conveniently recover the entire wallet with all the coins previously stored on it with any BIP32/39/44 (standard) wallet.
Why is a hardware wallet better than a paper wallet? When you spend out of a paper wallet, you need to trust the interface you are using as you give it your private key. After using a paper wallet it becomes insecure, and you need to move your coins to a new wallet. This will not happen with a hardware wallet, as all operations are done on it, and only the result (signed transaction) is sent back to the interface.
@_date: 2017-05-06 17:15:24
Default seed has 24 words. It is not hard coded, it is generated for you when you first set up your device. You can always delete it and set up a new one (but don't forget to move your coins first)

The **probability** of an all-purpose OS to have security vulnerabilities is higher than the probability of a specific one-purpose device to have one. This is logical: an all-purpose OS like Android is much more complex. Also, which device do you think will get a security update faster?
You can't just open up a TREZOR and read its memory, it does not work like that.
TREZOR will wipe itself and display a warning every time you use it, if the code running on it is not signed by the manufacturer. So, that's a no to malware exploits through USB.

I work for TREZOR so I will write down a few points vouching for the device ;)
TREZOR is the first crypto/bitcoin hardware wallet and has been on the market for a few years now. It has a clean track record, history of safeness, and a wide community support. We maintain a regularly updated [blog]( with various guides, there is a Telegram community chat and a responsive support team.
It is also completely open-source, both hardware and software, allowing for third-party audits. Integrations continue gradually, both for cryptocurrencies and services. All functions are built into the firmware, and sent to users through optional updates. Firmware signature is verified by the device, and if it does not match our company's signature, then the TREZOR wipes itself and displays a warning at start.
As for the form, it looks like a garage remote, if you want to conceal it as something :)

If your hardware wallet breaks, you can recover your wallet with another one, or even in software wallets like those mentioned by OP, with the help of your **recovery seed**.
Recovery seed is basically a paper wallet. Store it away, like you would with your paper wallet. The difference between a hardware wallet and a paper wallet is the security for spending. You can't easily and safely spend out of a paper wallet. If you plan to only hodl for 10 years, I guess you could bet on a paper wallet. But a hardware wallet is better for versatility.

If they follow the BIP32/39/44 standards then yes, these seeds are compatible.
It's not very difficult to get the private keys out of a seed, as **it is a standard**. Feel free to check out the converter here:

You are safe buying now.
Your bitcoins cannot magically turn from 2k to 200, as long as you don't use them. Their value might fluctuate though, but the market decides that, no one can predict it now.
IMHO, After Aug 1st, you should wait a bit until the dust settles. Then you can continue using btc normally.
If bitcoin splits in two separate chains, then TREZOR will eventually support both. You will not lose any coins though, even if the split happens.
@_date: 2017-05-24 09:33:53
Your phone, wallets, etc. (Anyone) can recreate all of your keys (incl. private keys) for all currencies with these 24 words, so it is important to keep them safe.
Anyone with your 24 words can access your entire wallet.
Edit: 12-24 words, generally
@_date: 2017-05-01 22:19:59
How do bitcoins get sent: Using your private key, you sign a transaction ordering your bitcoins to go to Bob. So, anyone with your private key can spend your bitcoins.
What is TREZOR? It's a hardware wallet, which holds these private keys. The signature process runs on the device, so that your private keys are isolated from the internet.

You don't need Chrome to use TREZOR Wallet (wallet.trezor.io). You can try using Firefox, just make sure you download TREZOR Bridge and set up UDEV rules.

Hardware wallet (like TREZOR) vs. paper:
* You can spend easily and securely with a hardware wallet.
* An unplugged hardware wallet is basically as secure as a paper wallet. Actually, it is safer. Paper wallets have no physical protection, anyone with access can use it.
* HW wallet's keys generation is safer. TREZOR uses entropy from the host computer combined with its own RNG.
* When spending out of a paper wallet, you have to trust the terminal/interface you are using.
* Paper can fall apart over time.

Can't help you with the app recommendation, but if it's a good wallet, you can import your TREZOR's XPUB to create a watch-only wallet on your phone.

TREZOR Is open source, you (or others) can check what it is running and if it is running what we say it is.
Randomness is generated using entropy from the host computer and the entropy from the device's random number generator.

If the firmware is not signed by SatoshiLabs, TREZOR wipes itself and displays a warning everytime you plug it in.

Yes, it's in the same repo as the firmware: 
@_date: 2017-07-04 23:26:51
I concur with on this one: if a fork happens, do not send any transactions. Wait until the dust settles. If you had coins on your TREZOR (or any other wallet where you control your keys), you will have the keys to both (all) coins after a chain split.
On the other hand, if you send a transaction during an uncertain time, you might lose coins on both chains due to attacks like replay attack.
@_date: 2017-05-05 16:22:34
Because when you spend with your paper wallet, you are entrusting your private key to some interface. To be secure, then you'd have to move your wallet to a new paper wallet.
Sure it might be easier to use Coinbase, but by using them, you are trusting them to pay out your money whenever you request it. Since you do not hold the keys, you depend on them. If you are using bitcoin to get away from banks (assuming you do), why would you trust another bank-like entity?
@_date: 2017-05-27 08:03:15
Well, of course we are not talking about remote attacks but physical attacks. Like, if the attacker gains physical access to your phone and uses some of the system's yet-undisclosed vulnerabilities. The probability of a phone with a wide-spread OS to have a vulnerability is higher than the probability of a simple, one-purpose device to have one.
Ultimately though, the main threat for Bitcoin is online: hacked exchanges and hot wallets. I am not saying your strategy is wrong or weak, not at all. I'm just saying there are reasons why a TREZOR is imho more secure.
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:20:23
I'd argue that's subjective and not objective. Security through obscurity isn't necessarily better, but as I said, it's depends on your point of view.
@_date: 2017-05-21 11:25:17
This is an issue with mempool: it is limited. Transactions with low fee can fall out of mempool. On the other hand, they do not disappear from different mempools at the same time. In this case, the transaction probably disappeared from our servers' mempools while some other node might still have had it. It's close to impossible to know the state of mempool for all the nodes out there.
I will ask our developers what's the setting on our backends, to increase the memory if it is necessary.
@_date: 2017-05-05 12:30:01
1. No, you need TREZOR to sign the transaction, and send it back to the Wallet interface on your computer. Unplug when you are done with using the Wallet.
2. Just unplug it, no need to eject.
3. No need to have TREZOR plugged in to receive transactions. But if you want to see what you received, then yes, it needs to be plugged it. Alternatively, you can [import your XPUB]( into a wallet to create a watch-only wallet. Then you won't need to have TREZOR plugged in and can still see your wallet balance.

All of the changes to our firmware are committed publicly to our GitHub repository. This allows for external audits but also internal verification of submitted code. The official firmware must then be signed by our **keys** before it can be run on a TREZOR without any warnings (if you're running unofficial firmware, your TREZOR will display a warning everytime you plug it in)

No, Litecoin is a completely different cryptocurrency, independent of Bitcoin. Of course, its value might fluctuate due to general uncertainty in the market. If you want to trade LTC, keep them on Coinbase. If you are looking for a good place to hodl, move them to TREZOR ;)

Exodus sets the mining fee. Keys are in Trezor.
When you set a transaction in Exodus, the app sends the request to Trezor (with address, amount, and fee). You then confirm the tx on the Trezor, which then signs the tx. (In other words, Trezor does what Exodus tells it to do, with you verifying that it is what you want it to do and eventually confirming it on the device.)
@_date: 2019-05-09 09:21:58
Each word represents 11 bits. You have 12 words. `12*11=132`
Why does each word represent 11 bits? Because the word list has 2048 words. log2(2048) = 11 
(2^(11) equals to 2048.)
In other words, there are 2048 possible combinations of 11 bits.
Word 0 = 00000000000 
Word 1 = 00000000001 
Word 2 = 00000000010 
Word 3 = 00000000011 
Word 4 = 00000000100 
... 
Word 2047 = 11111111111
Once you combine your twelve words together, you get 132 bits, a 132-long string of ones and zeroes. Let's say, you have Word 1 and Word 5 at the beginning of this string. The beginning would thus look like this: 0000000000000000000100...
You can play around with this tool to see how the words translate to bits: [
Generate 12 words, and then select "show entropy details". Interesting fields are then: raw binary, binary checksum (last 4 bits), word indexes (position of words in the wordlist), among others.

Hi, TREZOR Community Manager here. I am sorry for what happened. There are a few points that I want to clarify though. We are still a small company so it is not yet possible for us to have telephonic support. We do try to respond to all support tickets as promptly as possible, but the load has been quite heavy in the recent few days. Support workflows can always be improved though.
Now, to the RMA process. As I said, we are still a small company, therefore we require the devices to be sent back to us for investigation. After the investigation, if the device was truly defective then we send you a new one. If the device was not defective then we send you back the old one. As for the shipping costs, initially you bear the return shipping costs, and we refund them back on a case-by-case basis, depending on the result of the investigation.

Can you please PM me your email so I can look up your support ticket? Thank you
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:34:18
No, because these kinds of attacks (side-channel) require physical presence. If an attacker can get close to a hardware wallet, he can also get close to a paper wallet.
A side-channel attack (fixed in TREZOR) would require more work than simply stealing a paper wallet. Of course, you can encrypt the paper wallet, but you have to decrypt it anyway, whenever you want to spend it -- exposing your keys in any case.
In any case, the biggest threat to a bitcoin user is not a side-channel attack, but rather the $5-wrench-attack, no matter how safe the hardware is. This can only be mitigated by plausible deniability.
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:50:09

Litecoin is supported in [TREZOR Beta Wallet]( and Ethereum (all) are accessible through MyEtherWallet​, so you wouldn't lose access to them. Or you can access some coins such as BTC, LTC or DASH through their respective versions of Electrum.
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:24:33




Even if you had an unbreakable physical safe, it would be meaningless if you did not take the basic precautions, like not leaving your key combination on a table nearby.
Point is, hardware security is only one part of the system. If the user does not act safely him/herself, then his/her security will be obviously weakened. It's only as strong as the weakest part of the chain, and in this case, the weakest part is the user.
