Again. Assuming all of them are criminals. Fine dont pay your taxes. But dont use our roads. Dont use our bridges. Dont use our parks. Dont use our sports arenas or any kind of entertainment establishment. Dont use the sidewalk. Dont use street lights either.  Basically dont use anything that you benefit from me paying my damn taxes.

Paying taxes does not give the government more power over us. Sorry. We have a constitution and amendments that have protected us for over 200 years.

I dont really see your point. Paying taxes isnt a bad thing. It helps fund basic necessities we count on. And it also helps a lot of people. It also builds towards a strong economy. Just because you think everything that has touched the governments hands makes it tainted doesnt mean everyone else does. Seems like you are kind of paranoid and rebellious than actually caring about your rights that you think are being stripped away. 
Which they are not. Pay your dues just like everyone else does. Not because were scared to go to jail. Because its what is necessary for the current state of our society. We could be living like  people in some poor and underdeveloped parts of africa have too.

And that would be a great reason for us to elect this into legislation one day!

This makes absolute sense, as the government should not have a right to tax someone on what is not the governments intellectual or distributed form of payment. When exchanging one ledger owned by a government to another ledger which has no governing body, I think it should be common practice to only allow tax on the money which is sent to exchanges/entities which convert assets along with a tax on the monetary value of the fiat that is received by the receiver of that decentralized ledgers fiat value.
