Never too late to get involved in crypto currency.

They are cheaters, beware! You can never ROI with them. I'm registered 2 years ago and still not even close to ROI. 
First they pay daily, by the btc rises amounts going less and payment times become long. Now I'm getting payment every 10 days which I can take my money back in about 5 years.(if they won't lessen payments.)
Warn everyone you know for not their money to be stolen.

You're not idiot. Just inexperienced about crypto currency and fees like all of us once was. Next time try LTC instead if accepted for lower fees.

Dear jeantheboy, we both understand each other. They are disappointing either way. They are very responsive when taking your money and when you tell your complaints they answer late and all they say is "investing in crypto currency is your own risk" I've sent tens of emails to them, some are polite some are angry but they are shameless cheaters and nothing's changed after all. What I wanna say is solving a problem with them is waste of time and investing on them is loss of money.

Better not post square code next time.

I see. I didn't know how these cheques work.

Would you declare it online if you're a bitcoin millionaire? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:36:10
They seem so but definitely not. You can never ROI with them. If so, you're lucky. I've invested 0.5 BTC for BTC mining 2 years ago, they pay me  roughly 0.0080 BTC / month. You do the math.

That's because of the "HODL" think. Every currency, including physical ones, will go up as they circulate and traded.

Coinsbank is decent. Been using it for 3 years. Go register via web and get the app. You can also get debit card from them for instant cash.

They already know with this post ;)
