The wall is back. Again, this all seems awfully suspicious. If I were a seller with so much to sell, I would have been leaking out small amounts throughout the day. This activity suggests malicious activity.

Perhaps Bitstamp is hacked? No logical seller would advertise such a large amount...

There is just one risk to this otherwise guaranteed progress... The internet is inherently not secure. In an internet of things/data world the worst case scenario can be some leaked celebrity photos or intelligence cables or even some passwords. In an internet of money/value world the worst case scenario can be total-loss to underbanked adopters of this technology. 
A solution to this risk must be developed prior to any major adoption.

Based on  there could only be 27 wallets with that much BTC balance. If we do not see some significant movement as in (debits) from these wallets shortly, then we know something is off at BitStamp... A Hacker could be spoofing offers and buying BTC in other exchanges...

The problem is they cold-store 98% of their bitcoins. Most of these vaults are closed on weekends. That means these hosted providers are either long or short bitcoin (against customer claims) over each weekend. Could see potential losses due to this flawed model.

The interest rate is no longer decided by market forces. The interest rate is simply the "price" corporations, governments, and financial institutions are willing to pay everyone else to aggregate the majority of their capital and be the first to invest it. Gone are the days when the local interest rate corresponded to the local opportunities in your community. Oh Well..

BitGold looks to be backed by reputable investors such as the Soros Family, Eric Sprott, and Sandstorm Gold.
