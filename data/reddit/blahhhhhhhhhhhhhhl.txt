You don’t even have to read past step 1 line 1 
If you want to give away bitcoin just give them to me atleast I’d be thankful. 
But seriously it’s a 100% scam
Edit: *puts on tinfoil hat* 
Or maybe OP is looking for the noobs who don’t know what to look for in scams to in return find easy prey to scam them.

Had some sitting while it was close to 20,000 was waiting for a dip

There was a post on this sub where OP uses it to buy everything and no longer uses fiat money. It should be on hot.

I wouldn’t recommend it. Money and family don’t mix well. It causes disagreements and resentment after the fact. 
It’d be better to each get an individual wallet so they can be in control of their future and there’s no finger pointing. 
But your choice I’m just a random guy on the internet

Hodl my guy 
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:49:16
I have chase. 
No issues so far. 
Not disagreeing with you, just sharing my experience.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:32:06
This has always been my concern, and my skepticism of buying bitcoin.
