Yeah but if they see bids coming in they can pull their offers and change the best offer price or liquidity. Citadel And co. are top of book in a lot of shit. They're not paying 10x for that flow for no reason, these guys are ruthless. I would know.

HFT firms aren't custodians of the order at that point are they?  They just have the first option to execute on it. I pull offers when I see big bids literally all day, but I'm full prop.

Right? "Banks are evil, look how much more money this crypto exchange makes!"

Good,  now you stop repeating the drivel that you don't know anyone interested in equities. 
I hope you're not older than 16.

I don't even know what to say to that. What I do know is it totally disqualifies you from having an opinion on the comparison of exchanges.

If you don't know what The Nasdaq is you are not any kind of trading expert. Full stop.

No they aren't and no it doesn't. This post is so stupid it's unreal. This is a BAD thing. It means it's way, WAY more expensive to trade crypto than equities.

As it became more profitable from the increase in market cap wouldnt more computing power be put to mining and then hash difficulty increase and power consumption increase??

Oh, thank God.

What? This is a uninspired attempt to ride the coattails of a meme-ified recent purchase of banana at Art Basel. He tweeted about free money to a group of people waiting for him to give it away.
I, personally, dont see a modicum of artistic value in this.

Not everyone who doesnt believe in bitcoin is an imbecile. Especially one of the most influential economists of our time. Hes asked to opine on everything, hes going to get some wrong.

This could anonymously be bansky for all I know, so no. No I would not.

It's not a secret lol. It's a tool of monetary policy.
