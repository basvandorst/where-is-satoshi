Darkcoin's Darksend+ is much more private than CoinJoin and it will be open source very soon (pending an audit by Kristov Atlas and other unnamed individuals). Darkcoin makes a lot of sense to me because it extends the Bitcoin protocol and is working towards strengthening the fundamentals.
For example, the trustless decentralized mixing nodes (masternodes) require a proof of stake (can be kept in cold storage) to help protect against Sybil attacks, and they're incentivized in a free market competition manner by being rewarded for proof of service. They will likely provide other privacy related services in the near future as well, but I believe IP obfuscation is next on the list.
Monero is an interesting experiment, but it's far from battle tested and has some scalability concerns. Just the other day they had to stop transactions because of a critical bug being hit. Will be interesting to see how things progress.
@_date: 2014-09-06 23:03:53
I'm well aware who created CJ, and it is not nearly as private or convenient as DS+, which I'm sure GM will have no problem acknowledging once he can see the code for himself.
DS+ is by design stronger privacy than CJ and is being extensively tested in public as we speak. Go ahead and see for yourself. If you're afraid of the temporary closed source aspect, then simply use open source tools and try to trace some testnet transactions.
If you have genuine concerns I'd love to hear them, but so far Evan has repeatedly demonstrated he's in this for the long haul and understands how to strengthen the Bitcoin protocol fundamentals very well.

I don't think it's a healthy discussion at all given BMG hasn't presented any legitimate concerns and seems to be just ignorantly hating and pushing XMR (which by the way I haven't hated on at all, I've just expressed a couple of valid concerns).
That said, the MNs are not all on Amazon/DO, and if you look at my initial response you would see I said I believe IP obfuscation is next on the list, so the developers and supporters are certainly aware of the potential threat vectors. It has already been discussed and agreed upon that some people may want to select their MNs in addition to the already implemented feature of selecting the number of mixing rounds.
Far as operators and authorities go, I'm pretty sure doing such a thing would be illegal in most jurisdictions given an individual using cash/having financial privacy is not a crime. Even if it somehow were, a MN has no reasonable way to know if the service they're providing is being used to facilitate a crime. Not that I'm suggesting one should rely on the law to protect them, but everyone has to decide for themselves how far they want/need to go to have privacy. It's certainly a process, not a product, and I'm all for healthy competition in this space.
One of the big reasons I'm a supporter of Darkcoin is because Evan has demonstrated he understands the strengths and weaknesses of the Bitcoin protocol, and he is utilizing similar incentive structures to build a stronger network. I look forward to seeing what other privacy related services the MNs will have the option to provide!

We all deserve it? There are all sorts of people involved in Bitcoin. Either the fundamentals are there or they aren't; they will either be embraced and extended or they won't. Focusing on some perceived idea of a community seems pretty pointless to me. If we're relying on community/network effect alone to succeed, then we have in fact failed to create a superior form of money/payment network.

If anything this is a strong incentive to not operate too large of mining operations. If they get too large they will be a target, and if those regulators manage to get them to agree to do something stupid, then the value of the currency will plummet, which will destroy their investment.

LOL! You do realize that there's no such thing as perfect privacy right? I can name some theoretical attacks against XMR that are a lot more plausible. Regardless, the reason there are so many MNs on Amazon right now is because it's free/cheap and it's still experimental.
@_date: 2014-10-21 15:39:08
Sad how we just get downvoted rather than people stating why they don't think fungibility matters.
Why should consumers and businesses trust/have to pay centralized entities for privacy when using a decentralized currency/payment network? Given it's an immutable public ledger, strong privacy is very important for mainstream adoption.
What happens to our low cost frictionless payment network when regulatory entities decide that since there is a trail to follow, every business handling the currency has to take on the burden of policing?
@_date: 2014-09-26 15:46:28
Privacy is a process, not a product. I applaud CN efforts, but their design has yet to be properly battle tested (not to mention the scalability concerns). Even if the math/protocol hold up well otherwise, we still have to find ways to properly mitigate the attack vectors that all blockchain based currencies face (Sybil, etc).
Unfortunately, this is an area where the base Bitcoin protocol is lacking significantly, and the core developers have not made it a priority despite the threat to fungibility. My hope is that efforts like Darkcoin will at the very least force their hand on privacy concerns.
@_date: 2014-09-20 04:39:30
You should definitely bail on Bitcoin then, because there are certainly entities in positions of increasing power now, and it was always known such a thing would eventually happen assuming the long term success of the project.
The reason why we can still trust the system is because the incentives are there for these entities to compete in a healthy way, and for them to continue to operate and develop the protocol transparently.
Darkcoin is a genuine attempt to build upon the strengths of the Bitcoin protocol while addressing some of the weaknesses. We may not ever reach a truly perfect form of digital cash, but I do think we should keep moving towards that goal. :)
@_date: 2014-08-25 01:00:28
It's not about it being difficult; it's about it destroying their investment. Adding significant friction to a system designed to be frictionless would all but guarantee those voluntarily using it would leave and never return.

Yes, it does. In what way is it flawed? It's superior to CJ in every way. Why would I want to use Dark Wallet when it's centralized and less private? You obviously didn't read the instant transactions whitepaper or you wouldn't claim the Bitcoin protocol has that level of assurance instantly. What promises has Evan not kept?

This is one of the main concerns I have with the Bitcoin protocol. Strong privacy should be built into the base, because it's important for consumers and businesses, and because fungibility is a requirement for proper digital cash.
Luckily Darkcoin is well on its way to strengthening the Bitcoin protocol fundamentals. It has decentralized mixing already, and encrypted multipath routing is coming soon, as well as decentralized instant transaction validation (InstantX).
I don't know if DRK will be around in 5-10 years, but I sure am glad to see an altcoin project that's actually raising the bar and bringing genuine innovation! :)

It's pretty clear that you're more interested in acting like an ass and/or believing in biased viewpoints than you are in actually facing the realities and trying to come up with solutions. If the existing systems are working so well then why are we even talking about this? Your "points" and semantic arguments are quite moot. How many more middle class have to be relegated to lower class before you start looking for actual solutions to all our delusional nonsense? Most of those people will never recover for many different reasons and you don't even seem to care. Keep pretending and marginalizing, that's an awesome approach. You clearly have no idea how much pretending we actually do right now, and it's all coming to a head, whether we believe things or not. I never said it's immune; I said it's free market based. The ultimate goal is to be as incorruptible/stable and frictionless as money can be. No more excuses, or promoting/moving of bubbles and other forms of pretending. Bitcoin is not the only technical solution that's going to help either, but it's a great start to a solid base framework.
People like you are the reason why I don't even bother getting on sites like this very much. My time is much better spent working on technical stuff that actually solves problems.

I don't know why I'm even bothering to reply to this--especially so much later, but I'm rarely on reddit. It never ceases to amaze me how people think they can educate others on issues when they don't even have the slightest clue who they're talking to. I spent literal months studying economic theory and monetary policies worldwide before I decided to fully embrace Bitcoin. I've actually talked to many people that are struggling in this economy; I've even helped some of them with their budgets, so I know the actual numbers involved. Allow me to educate you a bit, but actually using some tact.
Most middle class people do not have the same investment options as others. Most of them are living week to week. Many things that should be getting done are not because of this, like basic vehicle maintenance. This ends up costing them a whole lot more when their motor doesn't last as long, or possibly even their lives because they're driving around with unsafe tires or worn out struts, etc.
They don't know when they might need some cash for unexpected expenses, which happens a lot more often than it should when they're constantly having to make compromises that simply shouldn't be made. The result is they try to save everywhere they can, which means they buy the cheapest tools available and do their own work on stuff; often times these tools don't even last through a single job, but what choice did they have but to take a chance they would hold up for their purposes?
They buy the cheapest foods available, which are often heavily processed and unhealthy for other reasons. They're on such a tight budget that they don't even get the variety in their diets they should, which has a serious effect on moral and overall health; it's a vicious cycle.
They end up having to put things on credit cards, or doing other extremely high interest things like taking payday loans. Inflation is nothing more than a stealth tax that mostly affects the people that actually need to keep their purchasing power. It creates a culture of disposable things. It discourages people from taking pride in their work. It promotes a culture of debt and fake numbers. It encourages people to do stupid things like buy lotto tickets and other high risk/get rich quick type nonsense. It encourages people to say "Why should I care about anything anymore? No matter how frugal I am, I still can't ever get ahead! What difference does a little more debt make when I can't pay any of this off anyway!"
The "job creators" complain that they're being taxed to death, so they're encouraged to try and use loopholes and hide their money. It's always excuses coming from all sides and pathetic attempts to use force where we know for a fact it will continue to fail. Bitcoin isn't even really a deflationary currency; it's a true free market based one, with the ultimate goal of being a stable currency that has the power to reduce fake numbers, excuses, and unreasonable taxes. It empowers people of all levels for many different reasons. It has the power to reduce or eliminate a lot of problems while saving people a lot of money on remittances in the process. It has the power to streamline banking and many other areas. I don't believe elemental currencies are the answer for many different reasons, but that's a topic for another time. You keep saying Libertarian, but you don't seem to understand that Bitcoin is money that's entirely independent of politics.
@_date: 2013-08-13 12:03:59
If they do something really stupid like ban US businesses from working with virtual currencies the show will in fact go on. The only actual effect it would have is further damage to the US economy.

Bitcoin will spawn competitors? There are plenty. I'm not aware of any so far that are genuine competition for Bitcoin. There will be growing pains no doubt, but I'm confident the open source community will continue to provide proper solutions.
To me Bitcoin is vastly superior to gold. Gold means you have to accept either counter-party risk or the risk of theft (vault vs home). Bitcoin is a much more flexible medium of exchange and store of value. Proper cold storage methods make it safe and cheap to secure.
Also, it's a bit surprising that someone writing for Forbes doesn't know the difference between an evergreen tree and a country. :P

I have a negative gut reaction when I hear people saying inflation is necessary to promote spending. I don't believe this is true, and the worst part is, the only people that seem to be able to properly insulate themselves from its negative effects are the people who need the least protection from it. It hits the young people starting their careers, the small business owners getting started, and the retired/elderly the hardest.
The other thing that really bothers me is that the official inflation numbers don't match reality. Economist.com requires a subscription for the full data, but I found a couple of other summaries based off it that cover how badly things appear to be.  
@_date: 2013-04-12 16:05:22
In my view you simply don't do business with people you can't trust. Granted, that means when a new company or person comes along someone has to test the waters a bit, but how is that really any different than how things are now? This is the information age, and we should be developing proper webs of trust for this sort of thing.
Having a third party involved simply wastes time and money pretending things are different than they are. If you really are concerned about this sort of thing, then I'm sure someone will come along and offer a dispute resolution/escrow service for a much better price than Paypal can offer.

@_date: 2013-03-07 16:07:03
I like the idea, but don't hotels still require a credit card to cover any extras/damages?

I don't think the bot reads edits. You'll have to post again.

1) Buy a bunch of BTC domains.
2) ???
3) Profit!
I would wish you luck, but it seems there's not much hope for you.
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:20:46
Yes. I heard you the first time.

What sorts of infection vectors are they using?

I just did a quick search and posted what appeared to be the most relevant one by the title.

It seems to be quite easy to find relevant credible research on these subjects if people actually bother to look.




How exactly non-ionizing radiation manages to do this may take quite some time to figure out, but it definitely seems to be happening.

I'm not a gamer, but I love this idea. I'm so glad it's working out well for you!

How you can spend so much of your life trolling is beyond me.

I wonder have they finally run out of videos for a while?
@_date: 2013-03-31 11:27:09
This is highly unlikely given the CIA invited Gavin to come speak and help them wrap their heads around how Bitcoin works. :)

Inflation erodes purchasing power from those who need it most while promoting a lifestyle of wastefulness and disposable things. People who have enough money can invest in things to protect themselves from this. There are other ways to handle loans, you really need to study some economic theory besides Keynesian. I'm aware it's imperfect. You can laugh all you want because I'm not a Libertarian, and I don't follow Alex Jones at all. I did a quick Google search to try and find the data I needed to reference.
@_date: 2013-06-12 21:19:37
Yes, those are clearly the only possibilities. 2 second search revealed this paper and others.

When was Max promoting it?  I just see the RT he did of Bill Still's video (where he admits he knows practically nothing about this stuff).

You're the one with an attitude problem that apparently doesn't know what you're talking about. Most feature length documentaries cost a lot more than $70k USD to produce. Look it up. They are not documenting this themselves they're using professionals, which you would know if you had done the slightest bit of investigation.
@_date: 2013-07-17 23:13:51
Thanks! I will definitely try to do that. I've had quite a few people essentially try and run me off, so it's been discouraging to participate in discussions at times. I've been working very hard to find my ideal role(s) in the Bitcoin world. Hope you had a great cake day! :)

Far as I can tell, webs of trust are the best way to really protect everyone. Sure, the merchant could show proof they shipped something to the consumer. Problem is, there's no way to know what (if anything) was actually shipped.
@_date: 2013-09-07 16:05:36
Glad to see you chiming in here because I don't see any mention of this on their web site.
@_date: 2013-07-19 21:08:32


It's called MintChip, and [as Matonis said]( it largely misses the point, so it is not a popular idea.
@_date: 2013-03-31 14:21:17
I'm aware of that. Just thought this is pertinent information, that the CIA, one of the top US intelligence agencies, can't understand Bitcoin without help. Do you honestly think this could be the pet project of any US intelligence agency? It's far too elegant, and it potentially cuts off their revenue source. Our best and brightest work in the private sector, period.

Wow! I think that's the most innovative candy I've ever seen! :)

While this is amusing, it is incorrect. Only the miners were affected. Not the vendors or the users.
@_date: 2013-07-09 21:04:50
There's [a new hot wallet]( that seems quite nice. They seem to know what they're doing and are apparently providing some of the first Bitcoin bank style services. Free transactions, free mixing, lending, etc.
@_date: 2013-06-25 05:26:48
Easy to use browser plugins that utilize public key crypto to create organized/intelligent webs of trust sound great to me!
@_date: 2013-02-17 02:37:48
Let me try to put this another way for you. You're right, but you already trusted the machine with your fiat *before* the transaction. :)
@_date: 2013-02-14 22:52:00
Everyone in big cities do something like this! :D
@_date: 2013-07-15 01:12:48
1. I'm not aware of any expert that has lost money this way.
2. Hardware wallets.
@_date: 2013-07-14 06:25:44
Apparently at least [one type of BTC bank]( already exists.

I never said most of our problems come from fiat, and therefore I'm done talking to you. I barely even know anything about Ron Paul, and what I do know is that he does have some points at times, but he mostly takes things too far.
@_date: 2013-02-18 00:12:33
Please tell me they're planning to start deploying nationwide! :)

Seems Apple doesn't understand the concept of temperature sensors having enough control to actually protect the components in the system!

We can't just be excited to be able to be rid of banks after all the problems they've caused? Riiiight.
@_date: 2013-04-03 06:49:34
Suggesting that the poor will be just as poor is ridiculous. Fiat (inflation) is not only theft, but it holds the poor and small business owners down, while promoting a lifestyle of debt, disposable things and consumerism (better convert your fiat to shoddy products before it disappears!). You also seem to be ignoring how Bitcoin can be utilized to put an end to stealth taxes/wasteful spending.
@_date: 2013-03-16 06:03:08
Wait a minute here. You think fiat has a clean reputation?! The USD is the  currency for illegal activities now!
@_date: 2013-02-16 20:45:54
I think it's increasingly attractive in a lot of ways!

They are not taking any of the money raised.

Forgive my ignorance, but there are mobile Bitcoin apps that download the entire blockchain? Wow! Having a mobile full node is certainly nice, but that seems like a great way to make most people think our system isn't worth the trouble.
@_date: 2013-02-10 05:55:30
Yes watch the whole thing and compulsively hitting refresh definitely pays off! There seems to be no end in sight. I'm guessing anything beyond 5000 µBTC has to be manually approved or something, because they haven't paid out in a while.

This isn't about me. I'm smart enough to protect myself from them. Why am I getting downvoted for speaking the truth?

Great look and feel. Nice features. Keep up the good work and stay vigilant!
