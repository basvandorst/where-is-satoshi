I mean, sure, there are plenty of way advanced things today. CERN being at the top of the list. However, the ancient people supposedly only had sticks and fucking stones to build all of their monuments. Look up puma punku in peru and check out their H stones. The only way this can be replicated today is with lasers. This means people 5000 years ago had laser beam shooting gadgets or they had some other type of advance technology which we dont today.

Recently got back from a 6 month trip in India. Its a beautiful place. This video, as well as many peoples preconception of India, is that its a shithole. Its just that our perception of life is that of living in a 1st world country. The thing to get over, if anything, is the culture shock; seeing how different life is there. Might be rough around the edges, but its a place rich in culture with a great, hospitable people.
@_date: 2019-07-17 04:10:20
Im a skeptic by nature. As a kid i always found it interesting how most ancient civilizations believed in a flat plane. Considering how these peoples were building shit we couldnt hope to achieve today, 10k years ago; I wouldnt call these people cavemen who didnt know any better. I am not 100% certain the earth is flat, but then again im sure as hell not certain the earth is a globe.

Not just the Egyptian pyramids. There are thousands upon thousands of hidden pyramids around the earth. There are ancient sites on virtually every country. Sites that are beyond today’s  technology are Machu Pichu, the Easter islands sculptures, Stonehenge, plus many more sites in hotbeds of ancient activity like egypt, Peru, and central america.
The point you made with the angles can also be done on a flat earth plane. Like i said, im not convinced of either possibility. I sure as hell believe that NASA is a complete fraud, its just an entity made to suck trillions of dollars in taxes. 1969 moon landing my ass. The official videos are a joke, totally staged. The fact that supposedly we havent been to the moon since that time just proves how far fetched the idea of going and coming back from the moon in the 60s is.
Either way it makes little difference in my life wether the earth is flat, a globe, or a simulation.

Mining is what gives Bitcoin value. By investing your resources in energy and mining equipment you secure the network and verify transactions. If it costs you 5000 usd to mine a bitcoin, that price is usually going to be the minimal valuation of Bitcoin

“If they mine bitcoin for 2x the market price they simple need to stop wasting money and buy them from the open market instead.”
It will never come to that. If miners buy from the market and stop mining then mining difficulty will drop, making mining more profitable. Real Bitcoin value is always around what it costs to mine.

These heavy hitting mining operations dont sell at a loss unless they completely have to. If they are mining btc at a cost of say 7000 usd and btc is worth 6000 usd these guys wont sell. Why should they? Im not saying miners dictate what is the exact price of Bitcoin. Im saying that the real value of Bitcoin is always what it costs to mine. Heres an analogy of the top of my head. Mcdonalds. Say their cost to make a burger is 30c and they sell for a dollar. If there is a lot of demand then they are going to raise the price. 1.50, 2, 2.50, and so on. If there isnt any demand then the lowest possible price is 30c. Anything below and theyre operating at a loss. Obviously Bitcoin isnt a company and yes the market dictates the price. However the REAL tangible way of valuing Bitcoin is by how much the miners are willing to pay to get their hands of some sweet btc.

Well im from Uruguay actually, but we are basically brother nations. Our economy depends heavily on Argentine tourism. If Argentina falls into recession, Uruguay shortly follows. 
Argentina is in a deep hole at the moment and personally i dont see a bright future for them. Theyve asked [the IMF for a loan]( last year, which im sure they will either default on or somehow negotiate to restructure their debt with the IMF. 
Interest rate in Argentina is currently 60% to attract foreign investment but that has not worked at all. It just shows how desperate the current government is. 
I got to buenos aires every couple of months. Last year i would pay ~70 usd a night for a decent hotel in the [Microcentro](  and about 15 usd for a meal. Now that same hotel charged me ~30 usd and ~ 6 usd for a meal. 
If youve held any other currency except the [Argentine peso]( then you would be very very well off. 
Now if youve held the ARS, boy you are royaly fucked. In the end its the same old story. The rich get richer (the rich and anyone whos smart keeps their money in dollars) and the poor who live paycheck to paycheck get poorer.

Lol dont be naive, there wont be any evidence. 
Coinbase ≠ honest. 
Browse r/cryptocurrency and you will find dozens of posts that prove Coinbase doesn’t give two shits about their customers. Regardless, if the banks have been practicing fractional reserve with wild success its hard to imagine Coinbase wont do it as well. If there is money to be made all morals go out the window.

Im in the same boat as you mate. Plan on doing something similar as ive learned from my mistakes during the previous run up. One word of advice is to over estimate the peaks and troughs of Bitcoin.

I get what you mean but its essentially the same thing. The problem is that merchants do not want to accept crypto due to price fluctuations. Instead of selling your crypto for goods your are selling your crypto to the service provider who in turn pays the merchant with fiat. Its a roundabout way but the only way atm

I agree with pretty much everything you said, the only thing that i want to add is that btc marketcap has tripled over the last couple of months. This astronomical growth is great but its not stable at all. Btc last stable price range was 1500 - 2000. Im not saying its gonna drop that much, i do think btc will stabilize around 3000 - 5000 in the near future

Bitcoin’s been in a slump for 3 days now, first time its done that since god knows when. If it drops below 6000 i see MANY weak hands folding; if it drops below 5000 more ppl will panic and it wouldnt surprise me to see bitcoin stabilize at around 3000 imo

True. The avalanche begun in 08 but was put on hold by QE. Now there is no amount of QE able to stop the incoming recession. My only question is the following; what if all governments decide to implement a permanent negative interest rate economy? They want the people to keep paying their game, so what is there to stop them from doing this scam world wide?

The thing is you will think you sold high but Bitcoin keeps climbing and you will miss the next parabolic advance. Besides this point, yeah, trade the shit out of Bitcoin.

Stupid argument. Being president/prime minister/governor is a serious job. The most important job in a country. The ideal candidate should be wiser than 10000 people. If not he has no business trying to govern others. Also. if Hitler had won WW2, he would be the hero and america would be the regarded as the villain today.
An emperor/king/dictator is the best method of leading. Imagine a two party system trying to lead a corporation. They would never get shit done and would get eaten alive by the competition. In the same manner, an incompetent CEO would also be terrible for the company. In business, as in government, there has to be a capable commanding officer, kept in check of course by other branches of government.

Not really. Im from uruguay in south america. Our country is uber corrupt, like politicians steal a shit ton from the government owned corporations like the power company and oil company. Im talking hundreds of millions of dollars overall in the last 5 years. This money could easily be used to fund a serious startup to make the next big thing. Btw my people are still starving thanks to this wild corruption. Fun fact: our politicians are exonerated from any financial crime they may commit while under office, so they can pretty much do whatever the fuck they want and they dont even get a slap on the wrist.

The germans are doing it right. They view bitcoin as private money and impose no taxes if you hold your coins for at least one year.

I mean, the logical thing for them, entities who control the worlds currency supply, would be to amass as much bitcoin to themselves as they possibly can while publicly demonizing bitcoin to the people. That way if bitcoin catches on they are still in control and if bitcoin dies out well then they are better off.
