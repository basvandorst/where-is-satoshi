47, here. Not a joe sixpack, but close. Just took my meagre RRSP (401k) stash and am converting to BTC. Waiting to fund.
I have a backup, but it's perfect. If the backup fails, BTC makes me win. If BTC fails, I have my backup. If BTC wins, and I get my backup in time before it all falling apart in 20-30 years, I still win.
A life of waiting for boomers to retire to make way for me, a lifetime of not getting my crack at something good, I am aiming for this to be the best decision of my life. I haven't made the best decisions, so let's ride the wave.

@_date: 2017-12-27 18:01:47

To make BTC worth one million each, BTC has to be worth about 21,000,000,000,000.

Even if it does, we are still bound to inflation. In 20 years anyone can be a millionaire. Houses cost that now. Nothing special houses. 
The giant industrial and corporate engine that sucks wealth from the middle class and poor to the 1%’s vaults needs to be destabilised. 
So let’s hope that the average person of sound mind can control their money in a better way. And if it gets to a million then booyah. But that will leave many in the cold that don’t buy in at all.

And gdax is fucked up right now (settings error) that I can't move my $50 in coinbase to it. I have $50 in coinbase and it lets me send $1 with $49 in fees to fund ICX.
Fuck every exchange right now. GET YOUR SHIT TOGETHER. I email coinbase to tell them the error message is being ignored by their webdev team as it's pervasive for some time now. email support coinbase app tells me.

Solar flares won't kill bitcoin. There is always a part of the planet that is protected from it and many people have physical storage, non-electronic storage.
And if the power grid goes down, like ALL of North America, bitcoin lives. I don't think you have read the whitepaper or understand decentralisation.
The illegal money in bitcoin is miniscule. The majority of illegal activities on this planet deal in USD $100 bills.
Laundered money also is insignificant. Most of the money in bitcoin was put in there by regular people who snapped it up at $0.12 lol

I have all my bitcoin files data and research in a folder. I open this folder as a disk image. I encrypted it with 256 bit option in Disk Utility. It also sits beside my time machine backups on said time machine. 
I strongly recommend this as your next implementation.  Even further, create a separate user account just for bitcoin stuff. No browser history etc and put it behind a crazy password. 
Also, once you find your key, go buy some metal like aluminium or brass, a stamping set (alphanumeric) and stamp it into the metal. Cover the metal with wax or plastidip and then stash it somewhere ultra safe like in the ground or at grandma’s house.

Shitcoin and the alts aren’t doing anything. I don’t think the XBT run is anything solid. If you want to make a few bucks I say sell now then buy at the coming -10% dip. 
Also, I think we should call it by it’s traded name, XBT. Calling is BTC just fuels the shitcoin sub.

Dips and corrections is nice talk for “people that sold” or “profit taking”.
I’m sitting here pressing f5 every 3minutes on QuadrigaCX hoping for funding approval to move the last of my fiat into bitcoin. 
No way will the freight train of the last month not resonate with people that have a hint of it. 
My gf is not even remotely into tech. We’ve been watching mr robot together and she sees me watching crypto charts all night long. She is going to buy a coin or two. 
The cat is out of the bag. People want in. Even if there is a correction there are HORDES like me who would pounce and buy ASAP.  Then the price will shoot back up. 
And the boomers are onto it. If they move even 1/10th of their portfolio to cryptocurrencies, ot would makes every Gen X and Millenial Who got in NOW or before, quite wealthy.

You underestimate coinbase buyers buying at full price. It’s massive. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:07:19
I only say that low because I don't know how many out there that want in fully understand they can buy part of a coin or that their exchange can have a buy or sell order put in at a set price and if the price drops overnight it will buy or sell for them.
They still think like wall street. You have to be awake and checking price/volume to make a purchase and that you have to buy UNITS of stock. I have had to explain to way too many people that I can't buy 1/10th of an Apple Stock with my fucking iPhone but that I can buy that equivalent of Bitcoin.
If they have $7500 to put in they might wait until it gets close to that to buy as close to 1.0 BTC as possible.

Waiting for a dip? Research the “never happened” housing price bubble in Vancouver. 
I sat there one day and realised that prices we’re going up 2.4times faster than I could save for a mortgage. I opted for a zero down mortgage and got in. Cashed out a few years later and moved away from Vancouver. Not much cash, but I bought a house and cut 5years off my mortgage. 
Now? The down payment required to buy in Vancouver is what my house here is worth. 
I should have bought back then. And it taught me that now is the time to buy bitcoin.

Vancouver, under BCHYDRO, has some cheap electricity rates and they are mostly green kilowatts that don’t come from coal, but hydroelectric.

I gotta figure out a way to make money off that.

You can sell them at $100,000 sure, but who would buy them?  Engineering a crash of that magnitude is historically doable, but they would have to have bought them at 1/5th crash peak (20K) to genuinely profit since it could drop well below 20k before people bought them to stop the slide.
China and Russia don't gamble with that kind of wealth in my books. They would rather manipulate indirectly via cyber attack or social engineering.

I think if it as a currency if it were pegged. 
And I won’t think of it as a currency until I can buy and sell it against itself with zero fees. Think trading two $50 bills for a $100 bill.
It can only become a currency if people accept it and it’s stabilised.  Right now it’s a Wild West money sink. 
If I put an ad up for my truck online, asking one BTC for it, the price that people pay fluctuates too wildly to be a currency. As a Canadian who has had to endure years of buying from America, I’m tainted. My currency fluctuates way too much against the US dollar. It stops me from buying sometimes.

I’ve lost about $8000 CAD waiting for fucking quadriga to approve my funding. I would have been way better off jamming all my cash into my credit card and porting it through coinbase and paying $1000 in fees.

I took a gamble. BTC was all over the map but r/cryptocurrency was really talking up lend. So I have moved my coin from quadriga to binance to trade some altcoins for a bit. 
I made some good gains on XRP (ripple) then saw that LEND was still really hot but in a bear trap. Enter risk. Bought all I could at 0.00001222 and set a sell order for 0.00001600 overnight. Woke up to it being 0.00001800 lol.

You need to read more positive comment on here. Some of your statements are way off.

You missed my point. If you believe in BTC and look far enough into the future, you may not have to cash out. Or pay taxes. 
You don’t have to cash out to USD or a US bank.

Best part is that these transactions are small. They are investing. Saving. Hoping. Gambling perhaps.
But when they cash out with a few hundred dollars profit and give up the game, they will download another popular app and move on. Making more BTC available for us at a still inexpensive rate.

Yo Mr. 16. Google daily compound interest calculator and add 0.5% a day to your 20 dollars. Most only let you do a year at a time. Do it for 10 years. See how much you will have in 20 years. Fiat equivalent that is.
Do you see the effect of compound interest? Let bitcoin slowly creep in value as the world moves towards the idea. HODL on to your money. Put $20 in every month. 
At 16 you have years on your side. If I was 16 and had your forethought, I could have bought Apple, Microsoft, Ebay, Google, everything... for cheap and had YEARS to sit on it.
Stay in the game.

I read a post here yesterday that someone did the math. There will only realistically be 811,000 people on planet earth, regardless of population, that can hold at least one BTC. 
Think about that. Only 811,000 people will be able to get in and hodl one coin. I aim to be one of those people. I may be rich, I may stay status quo and everyone else becomes poor. 
I was there the day eBay went public. I wanted in. I didn't have enough cash to open a stock trading account. I had enough saved so that by end of day one of trading, I would have had $48,000. I will not miss out because some old white dude tells me I have to jump through 87 hoops and sign up for him to be the overseer of my money along with exorbitant fees.

I'm 47. And Canadian. You don't get to where I am and not realise how to get around capital gains. We currently have no law on crypto-currency capital gains. Only foreign currency or when you turn BTC back into CAD. I have a paper trail showing I've paid in CAD funds only. If they ever change the law. And If I ever care to report it. The "cash out" I hope to have may involve me just transferring my bitcoin to someone and poof, no capital gains.

I’m hodling until it hits 1 million CDN. Because then I won’t need it. I can sell a bit, live mortgage free, buy a rental property to get someone to pay for it and get all my interest written off, and still have 0.5btc to draw off. 
I don’t have kids but I want to leave my niece and nephew with each a paid off house and hopefully 0.1btc once I really cash out. 
Edit- I also hope by then that I can have my renters paying me in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 15:45:27
I’m well aware. I’m just talking about infinite supply and finite supply along with the differentiation between who can grow bulbs and who can mine coins economically. 
It’s a bad comparison. You can compare Honda Civics to other Honda Civics or Ferrari 430s to Ferrari 430s. But to say “cars” is invalid. Bubble to Bubble is the same here. Different kinds or bubble.

Understand that bitcoin isn't rising in price, it's that USD is CRASHING against BTC. People don't have faith in USD or what back it. Or any fiat currency.
I'm here thinking 20 years from now. Where current policy will take us. Where current geopolitical currents will be taking us. I remember the 70s. The future is here and now for me. I have the experience to see that 2037 could be very serf and fiefdom.

You think bitcoin is made of fiat. Fiat is just as "nothing" as bitcoin in terms of value. It's that fiat is made of value and the idea of value is switching to bitcoin. Again, people are not putting MONEY into bitcoin, they are putting their VALUE into it.
Bitcoin and blockchain technology itself are going to take over many verticals soon. Example: Ticketmaster is dead in the water soon. Ticketmaster sells to scalpers in milliseconds then they resell the tickets at 3x the price to consumers. Blockchain technology will kill Ticketmaster.
Want to send VALUE to your friend in exchange for goods? Or buy something from craigslist? You both pull out your phones and exchange the VALUE. It goes through no bank. What if you could pay rent like this? Services? What if someone decides to offer mortgages based on VALUE not money/fiat? 
Value. Where people put their blood, sweat, and tears. Dream of a future free from corporate billionaires deciding YOUR value. That's just ONE facet.

@_date: 2017-12-09 21:55:13
I think you underestimate the amount of people waiting with fat accounts for the price to drop. The buys will start flooding in and balance out the drop at no less that $7000.
If the government decided to do it it one fell swoop they would have some pretty stupid people running the show. Slowly build the "flood" to X coins per day in a gradual release. Once half or 2/3rds of the coins are spent, turn off the tap immediately. Watch the price spike perhaps 10% or more, then start the process again.
I'm a nobody and I know this would work better than DUMP.

Coinbase is crashing harder that BTC
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:31:39
Finite supply. Russians farming. China against it. 
I’m in.

If bitcoin went to 1mil CDN and I had one btc, and if I could be perceived as a millionaire, buy real estate, buy gas, tea/coffee then yes, it’s a utility. 
But I can’t buy and sell btc without fees or equality so it’s not quite there yet.

This was Christmas shopping money profit taking once it hit 11k. Then everyone wanting in bought and everyone who sold for profit (spending money) is back to where they were. 
Do this monthly please lol. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:27:04
Yeah, if coinbase would actually function. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:54:22
I’ll watch tonight and see lol

Well put. My investment is nearly 10k. I would be FAR more pissed about missing out on the gold rush than about losing my 10k. 
I have a backup plans and this endeavour is my ultra risk, where my main assets are ultra conservative. 
It’s my gambling money I guess. Where the rent money is safely in the bank. Analogy only.

Plus it's finite supply that is limited in price by the cost of electricity to find one. It's a gold rush yes, with electricity projections coming in at 2020 when the world's electrical output would be 100% for bitcoin mining at today's rate of climb.
It's a finite curve that will bubble, or it will be astoundingly high because there are no more left or it costs a shit ton in electricity to find the remaining few.
Vancouver real estate taught me that bubbles are in the minds of the people that stay on the bottom floor.

What hardware do you have?
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:27:35
Not so easy if you are Canadian. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:25:09
People want Christmas spending money and sell. When there is a big profit taking sell, the prices can crash. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:58:13
Gone so far as to look on redbubble for a HODL shirt lol
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:56:01
People saw it high, took some profit for Christmas money, outsiders bought in and made the money back. 
November, November, remember the 28th of November (hint, this is the second cycle of this)
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:16
It crashed harder than BTC
Coinbase is a joke, at the largest.  Bizarre. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:47:49
He should have bought $7 more btc instead. Weak. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:37:43
Then I could buy 2 lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:09:37
I have a good inheritance down the road. Not rich, but I might pay off my house. The money I have saved myself over the years could buy 1.5 coins  today and I've been totally holding off out of fear.
Today I realised that losing ALL of that money will not be as crushing as losing out on doubling it. I now know I have to buy ASAP.
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:31:06
I’m gonna cash out at 1million. I’ll pay off my house. Buy another house for rental.
Rent my two houses out, then buy a third house to live in. The rent should cover about today’s equivalent of $3500a month in income after tax benefits. I could finally work for myself or just not really work at all. Three houses, mortgage free, two rented. 
I’d be happy cashing out and making it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:55:08
So he has a shit tons of Bitcoin then. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 15:12:52
No one that spells it “checks”
People that don’t use them spell it cheques. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 22:52:20
News flash. Cheques are used everywhere. 
Just not to pay for groceries.
