Here you are assuming the hacker knows that there is ceaser cipher applied. The point is if someone dosent knows its difficult to decipher. And again its very flexible too. say I add 2 digit to every number not divisible by 3 and substract 3 digit for those divisible by 3 . Easy to implement and decrypt if you know what formula you applied and very difficult for the hacker to implement such infinite brute force possibilities.

Try telling this to the venezualan ppl. And dont think that this cant happen to USD. The time china decides to dump USD, you will be scouting your wages on a daily basis.

I dont know how its easy to break such kind of encryption. 
Eg say my private key is 6djwic4d1 . If we do shift by 2 gives 8flyke6f3. Now tell me how you find the above string is correct from below string.

True. Its just sliding back to 1 week back levels. Not even reached there. So just a minor 1 week bubble.

Lol ... rem ford also mocked tata when they launched indica that they can't make a decent car. And now tata bought over jaguar and land rover from them. 
Karma my friend. Karma.
