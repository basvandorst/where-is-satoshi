It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense
@_date: 2014-07-01 05:03:14
It moved about $15 in less than a minute, so it wasn't a tiny movement, I was expecting it to jump $50+ within the hour, which it eventually got to, but just not in an hour haha. Anyway, as you have seen, it has risen $50, not big, but at least some movement...
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:53:36
nope, bought quite a few bitcoins at the low price and transferred them out...
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:58:14
Thought just struck me. What if they purposely did this so that everyone would buy in and they gox us all? I don't trust that zhou guy (to memory that was his name). This explains why I cant move my bitcoins out of that wallet.
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:51:28
When I buy, it drops. When I think to buy, but don't, it rises. How about everyone pays me $1 each, then I won't buy and it will rise and you all win!
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:13:04
Thanks for explaining that for me!
@_date: 2014-05-25 12:56:28
[Yeah, screw this, I give up] (
@_date: 2014-07-03 13:41:22
They have $5,000 limits per transaction, though past that, I thought it was unlimited transactions?
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:22:50
pay day? Could you elaborate on that more? As in a majority of citizens get their pay on every Wednesday?
@_date: 2014-05-25 13:00:59
I have spent thousands with coinjar, whilst it is reliable (as in you'll get your bitcoins), i wouldnt' be too hot to trust them, so store shit offline. Secondly, their support is terrible, they don't seem to really give a toss about anyone. 
I have gleaned this from a couple of instances, the most notable where they held a fair amount of money I transferred to them for days, without explanation (this wasn't a first transfer or anything, had done quite a few). I finally got it though (before support even bothered to get back to me) and when support did get back to me, it was more of a "oh...yeah...my bad...". They never gave a reason and don't think they even apologised and not a single shit was given. 
**tl;dr** Can get bitcoins off them, don't trust for a second though
edit: Just to clarify, I mainly use coinjar to get my coins.

maybe it is, maybe I'm wrong. But I do remember my English teacher back in high school making the distinction when we were studying Othello lol. But maybe it's wrong.
@_date: 2014-07-03 08:23:10
Yeah, noticed. Thinking they made a mistake amd are accidentally displaying aud price as usd. Thinking to buy now and sell it when they correct the price
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:37:33
yeah it dropped after I made that edit. It's now stagnant again...damn lol. 
edit: it seems to be dropping back down again. I'll come back in 30 mins and see what happens lol.
@_date: 2014-04-04 12:02:33
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:44:12
I've tried contacting them many times to no avail. It seems like they simply don't care as seen in my case and the other public cases in their ticket system.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:29:12
cash out, buy back on the low. By holding for the entirety of the time, you make less.....
@_date: 2014-10-06 04:42:00
well when bitcoin reaches mainstream adoption, no one will be looking at market charts anymore. For instance (this is purely hypothetical), people will think of bitcoin just like they think of fiat in relation to what it is worth. So just like people think like, "$2.50 will get me a bottle of milk", at true adoption, it will be the same, just thinking, "0.3 bitcoins will get me a pack of gum". 
When bitcoin reaches true adoptions, no one will be obsessing over market forces lol. It will just be referenced to goods and services, just like fiat is. 
@_date: 2014-06-02 10:44:43
sorry for the noobness, but how do I see the volume statistics?

looks like some people have their fingers hovering over the buy button and some are prematurely launching. Imo, just wait it out, it will dip in the vacuum that is to come with the lack of auction results. Next couple of days will be interesting.
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:36:52
I do know how it works, I just have some gaps in my knowledge that really shouldn't be there. I have learnt my lesson and going to do some more reading. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 09:13:25
You'll say it needs to drop back to $600 in a couple of years, don't sit on your hands.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:03:01
Good to see yours ended well. I definitely didn't have an error or anythign with any reference numbers, bank numbers or anythign. I directly copy and pasted the info they ahd given me. This wasn't my first transaction, so I had already had experience of what to do. 
I'm just every disappointed with the ticketing system. If you have a quick browse of the public tickets put forth, you'll see quite a few people complaining about their lack of support. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:17:08
better be quick.
@_date: 2014-05-25 08:00:24
just to clarify, envy != jealousy (which has the negative connotations). I, like you admire the courage it took in the very early days to invest in bitcoin. My own friend invested thousands in the very early days, back when it was a couple of cents and he is now a millionaire and I'm happy for him.

yeah sure, no worries! Here's my password, **********, and I'll upload the wallet.dat file shortly :P
But in all seriousness, thanks for your re-assurance! I really hope I didn't lose my bitcoins, it was 60% of my total savings :(
@_date: 2014-04-02 12:06:51
when you say that, do you mean I just keep backups of the wallet.dat file, or is there more to that?

do you even lift? Brah?
@_date: 2014-06-02 10:46:14
Yeah, I'm planning to hodl for the long run lol, but it is more effective to ride the ups and downs and sell in the long run as well. So the assets you hold in bitcoin you keep making money off them on bitcoins journey to greater value, rather than just hodling and cashing out once, when you can cash out every couple of weeks without losing your overall bitcoin worth.
@_date: 2014-06-07 12:58:59
About half a million dollars in USD. Ouch.
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:16:55
yep, still no luck.

I just did too!

Yeah you need to be logged in. But you can also go to  that was off the top of my head, so it may be wrong
@_date: 2014-07-03 08:35:32
seriously thinking of just buying now, and selling later when they correct the price. Whjat do you reckon?
@_date: 2014-07-03 10:49:46
you are quite right in your observation, this would make a lot of sense of why they only have a $45,000 worldwide limit because they only buy $45,000 worth of btc each day...
Still doesn't explain the wallet situation though....I still haven't checked the transaction on block chain, I was watching a movie lol, checking now...
@_date: 2014-05-20 03:28:24
yeah, I noticed as well haha. Just bought 1.5BTC, we'll see what happens. But it's stagnating around $496 (AUD) atm.
edit: It's now rising again...
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:47:59
Still no sign of my bitcoins, no idea wtf just happened. Going to look it up now. They probably havent released it on their end even thougj the system says they have made the transaction. Looking it up now...
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:31:42
wow, thanks for leaking this. Do you have any more info? Did you take any of the file(s)? Any more pictures or anything?
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:09:02
well I just bought a few bitcoins, tried to transfer them out, it said it transferred, but they aren't showing up on my bitcoin client :( They aren't in my coinjar wallet or bitcoin client :(
@_date: 2014-05-22 16:47:15
Well I sold at $518. It looks like the price is starting to creep up again *DOH*. I might buy in again lol. Prices are so confusing, very hard to tell what's what :/
@_date: 2014-07-03 09:46:49
Coinjar went from $640 to $670 thrn back to $640. All in the space of 30 swconds. Looks like their pricing is completely spazzing out.
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:36:12
Thanks for your advice, I'll definitely take it on board
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:48:22
we all gonna make it brah ;)
@_date: 2014-04-05 13:08:58
mmm here in Australia, bitcoin is still largely reported in the media and 'well-known/big' companies haven't really adopted yet. I don't knwo of any high end companies like Porsche accepting bitcoin (in Australia that is!). It'll give a really good image of bitcoin I think and even if it doesn't make the news on TV, I'm 100% sure the newspaper will pick it up, since the Porsche outlet is on THE main road for business in the city and therefore the biggest newspaper outlet in our city is on that road as well, so I'll pop in and have a talk to them as well if all goes well!
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:58:42
yeah, sorry, that's what I downloaded, woke up today to find it had the same error while downloading the blockchain. Not going to use bitcoin qt/core again...
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:18:12
Sorry, I don't follow, can you please elaborate? Are you referring to the hole or the shit? If you're referring to the hole with the shit, then no, it doesn't have intrinsic value because both take basically no effort to make/have. Whereas digging for a day to get to a piece of metal, has instrinsic value because of the value of a day's work.

my exchange takes a little bit of time as well. What I do is I deposit money beforehand and just leave it in there. So when something comes up, I have money already there waiting. So just deposit whenever and just leave it in there. Don't go bubble-&gt;deposit-&gt;react, go deposit-&gt;bubble-&gt;react

well china is going to sleep now, so cash out now? Price is starting to gently drop as well. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:22:19
wow, it's down at $560 now. It was at $585 just an hour or so ago.
@_date: 2014-04-05 05:54:14
eh...I lost $250. Damn.
@_date: 2014-03-23 11:29:26
lol, the definition of "need" support as I have found in my case is everyone, as what happened to me, can happen to absolutely anyone. I did nothing wrong, just transferred the money as instructed and as I have done before with coinjar and suddenly I'm in a world of problems. Coinjar, never again lol.
@_date: 2014-07-02 00:31:51
wow, thanks for leaking this. Do you have any more info? Did you take any of the file(s)? Any more pictures or anything?
@_date: 2014-10-30 14:21:02
No, you could just gather someone else's shit, or wait till you shit again....so your shit would have no instrinsic value. That's like using the argument, "here is a leaf, I will dig a hole 1 km underground and put it there, therefore a leaf has an instrinsic value of thousands of dollars...." when in reality, you would just pick up another leaf off the ground...
intrinsic value implies that there is a limited resource AND coupled with that, reaching that resource has a minimum **opportunity cost**

I like it when I am casually browsing reddit and something like this pops up onto my reddit feed because by the time bitcoin actually enters my train of thought, it's 1 hour later and the buy in opportunity has passed. I'm not thinking of bitcoin 24/7, so with it coming onto my reddit feed, I can be more or less alerted to seize the opportunity. 
Lastly and most importantly; too*
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:16:31
hmmm interesting, still no sign of my bitcoins. Looked it up on blockchain, unconfirmed transaction, no sign of it on my bitcoin client either, even in an unconfirmed form. Price has gone back to $700. How long ago did you transfer the btc from cj wallet to your personal wallet?
edit: wtf, went back to $640 now. This is so retarded. My honest advice is for everyone to try get their coins out and wait for this to blow over....something doesn't feel right
edit: 5 confirmations and counting, yyeeaahhhh buddy!
@_date: 2014-05-25 05:18:44
It's about 1PM in china IIRC. I've been looking at world times right now, can't figure out who it is lol.
@_date: 2014-03-23 08:01:30
[This shouldn't be here then...](
Aside from that, the main point is the complete lack of support and I mean a complete lack of support. I haven't heard a word from them this whole time which is extremely concerning when I have put down multiple tickets over the period of this whole ordeal...
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:57:07
Awesome, coinjars 1% fee keeps shafting me haha. When trading a lot of bitcoins, it actually takes a sizeable amount

Like L from death note
@_date: 2014-07-03 11:27:02
hmmm I sent out my coins way earlier than both your transactions? Maybe they're letting smaller transactions go through and bigger ones, they are holding onto? Idk, this is so weird. I'm watching the price really closely atm as well.

And here we go again. *straps rocket boots on*
@_date: 2014-03-23 10:27:22
Mmmm tbh, I think they ARE trustworthy, they just have really really really shit support, which show their complete disregard for their customers. And yes, that's correct, I haven't received a single response or even acknowledgement that something is wrong. This is $680 we're talking about, this is people's money they're playing with. At the very least, they could acknowledge that something is wrong. 
Mmmm I directly copied and pasted the bank account number they gave me, so that's definitely right.
@_date: 2014-03-23 07:35:57
This happened way before the weekend....it's been a couple of days now...I've checked my transaction history three gajillion times and the details were definitely right and everything. I directly copy and paste the account numbers and everything anyway, so there's definitely no error there. 
I honestly wouldn't mind if it takes a little bit of time to process, I can understand at times they get a lot of volume. But the COMPLETE lack of support is extrtemely concerning and shows they really don't give a shit about their customers. I would at least at the very minimal like to know what's going on, just a simple "we have a lot of volume atm, we'll attend to it as soon as we can" would be the very least they coudl do. I have had NO response at all from them. 
I'm just extremely disappointed and pissed off. $680.00 is a lot of money to me and I should have been a lot more careful before trusting them. I guess I'll just find another entity to buy my bitcoins from in the future. I was under the impression they were popular and reliable in Australia though....
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:15:43
It's $530 now, so I bought back in :/ If it goes down, I'll just put the coins in cold storage to sell during the next bubble haha. With this mini-bubble, it is very hard to tell what is happening with the price, whereas with others the price consistently went up by a lot each hour.
@_date: 2014-06-30 06:03:35
Sorry, what does going short mean?
@_date: 2015-04-29 06:49:49
I think they're going to be in for a rude shock over the next five or so years when bitcoin continues to gather traction...
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:33:29
I have absolutely **no** doubt that bitcoin will 10 years from now. However, what I'm lamenting is that it's going to be a lot smaller than it we expect. Let's face it, it's the western world that we want to capture with bitcoin, for really, they are the financial backbone of the world along with China. But I highly, highly doubt that the American government or any other western governments or banks are willingly going to let something flourish that will render them **less control and power** which is what it comes down to at the end of the day and as we all know, China has banned it about a gajillion times and we all know China's antics when it comes to power and control *cough cough internet censoring*.
I have no doubt, that 20 years from now, there will be countries that went through instabilities politically, economically etc that are environments which caused bitcoin to flourish, but as I mentioned in my point above, if western governments &amp; banks don't accept it, then that's a huge blow. 
But as I said, I have no doubt that bitcoin will continue to exist in one way or another, which is great.
@_date: 2015-03-31 11:41:31
no, believe me, believe me, I do. With all the big companies that have supported it in the last year, the startup scene that has flourished around it and all the bright and intelligent people that are pushing it forward into the future day by day. At the same time though, I don't think we should be so naive as to underestimate, I hate for this to sound pejorative, but naive as to underestimate "the mob", i.e. the public. If the government bans it, then it's going to be only the teach saavy people that are a subset of society that would be looking to use it and within that subset, only a subset of the tech saavy people would actually break the law to use it.
But yes, it'll be interesting to see the future seeing as, as you did mention and I acknowledge bitcoin has HUGE momentum behind it, so it will take a HUG force to stop it as well.
