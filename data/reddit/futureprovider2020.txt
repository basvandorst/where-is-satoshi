my opinion is cryptos are the future... so in this example we will use fiat currency as a horse and buggy and crypto is the ford model T.. it took time for people to come around and see the potential for combustible engines. now we cant imagine a life without them.. same with crypto in 20 years u will be "rembering a time when u used to use paper as a exchange"
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:13:42
i would argure BTC is 9 years old.... gold has been used as a medium of exchange for 1000s of years so gold is a little more "stable" but BTC is more valuable

dont listen to these fools telling u, u cannot shop with crypto....
they r "investors" not believers in crypto.... crypto is here and it is just starting to change the way we live.. look at japan... they are a good 5 years ahead of the crypto game... most their merchants accept crypto... so to those na-sayers. GET LOST!

im state side :( so i sadly do not know...

xodus.io is my personal favorite to store most my coins... however they seem to have a high fee to move ur coins out of their wallet. this will eventually change.. until i do not spend my coins i send there i just hodle them.
i did download the bitcoin.com wallet to see what that is like i have yet to send bitcoin to it but i do have $10 in bcash on there. i also have blockchain wallet for my phone. i guess my long rant is to say the more wallets the better... just make sure to store ur seed keys in a safe place where u wont lose them.

i do not rule it out.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:56:51
actually i think it was added yesterday :)
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:47:16
and BTW i said "...if btc hits $10..." not that it wont ever happen.. my wont ever happen comment was about how the US gov will not go back on a gold standard and will not balance a budget...
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:43:51
well ill agree to disagree we both are speculating. no one knows. i admit i know nothing
@_date: 2018-01-18 20:52:17
hahahahaha balance budget.... ur funny.. there is no incentive to balance the budget. so we will spend our self  right to the next depression.... luckily i will have crypto to combat the hyper inflation we see everyday... 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:09:17
i can tell u more then a million people see its value. 
thats one indication of value, is acceptance.
another value is limited supply.
another value is decentralized
now if u asking how i convert that to USD value i cannot answer because you are asking me to show u value in something that has no value (usd).
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:05:14
BTC will eventually be valued in BTC but until then we use the next best thing to value it which is fiat currencies 
@_date: 2018-01-19 00:11:57
i do believe u are having a hard time grasping the concept of bitcoin's acceptance... and for that i will refer u to just look at how many people have got into crypto within the last 3 years..... a staggering amount when u consider bitcoin has been around for 9 years... time will tell but i see a future where the gas station charges more if u pay in usd because they have to pay taxes on usd... and u can get a discount for paying in crypto because well its peer to peer and removes the 3rd party
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:26:13
i just doubled checked... u cannot buy anycoin via bank card via blockchain app
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:19:08
no u cannot buy btc via blockchain app
and on a side note why would u want to sell ur BTC for (lets just say) 100% gains. ok now u put those gains into a currency that is on its way out... buy BTC for the long game not the short
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:12:09
but u are missing the point.. if BTC falls to $10 then that means the us govenment balanced the budget and went back to a gold standard.. those wont happen ever!
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:36:12
so i will answer your question with a question.... what gives the USD value?
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:46:56
if u have not had problems with coin base consider yourself lucky and stop using them b4 u have a bad experience with them... if u see all the post talking shit on coin base there is a reason.. coinbase sucks!
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:32:18
u misunderstood 
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:02:55
BTC is the gold standard... 
there are other metals (coins) that have value but its compared to gold (BTC)...... the market moves with according to BTC
@_date: 2018-02-02 05:14:51
nice i took all my btc out of coinbase today, paid $3. im cool with $3 its not $.02 but it beats $18
@_date: 2018-02-04 14:42:36

@_date: 2018-02-02 05:36:16
buying btc with paypal is like luke and leia having weird sexual tension in "a new hope". it just cant happen ok.
