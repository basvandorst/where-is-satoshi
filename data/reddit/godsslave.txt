I doubt that sir:) That is for sure:) Come and ask basic question, I can guarantee you will not be banned.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:14:16
Your intense activity proves me right. Noone would fud a dead project:) We have already over 50 comments here, which proves me that this project is real and legit sir;)
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:17:01
I have no idea what you are talking about, yesterday CMC had 13$ so I don't know what are you talking about. Also when we have trade on Aph Dex I know always  it is real through the commits sir:) You are desperaet attempts only prove that we are real and great sir:) I understand , well I am sorry that the Aph Dex doesn't show the last 24 hours trade volume, however this doesn't matter I see the real volume through commit and also through CMC anyway. ;) You try to attack us on any possible thing:) Are you this desperate? When is Nex available? No answer sir?:)

@_date: 2019-07-01 08:30:38
Well I act already if this would be a bull market since it looks very bullish to me. Yes, my alts are down, but if you are a Bitcoin holder you enjoy huge profit sir:) You can buy when Bitcoin will be confirmed in a bull market when we hit 30k$ within a year.
@_date: 2019-07-15 11:27:32
Bitcoin is the king. 65.8% record dominance for 2018/2019 so far.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:50:20
Lovely, another brilliant use case.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:34:39
You are scared off Aph sir with your friend:) If you would not be worried you wouldn't put an effort into this sir;)
Sir, this product is already conquering the market. 11.66% up , 52686$ volume , over 633k market cap, 13$ volume sir:) Well I am quite honest one, I want to put money into this myself and I will put. I do hope that you manage to make the price lower so I can buy more at a cheaper price, honestly I doubt that you can manage to have any meaningful effect but it is a good effort sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:45:08
Man, you are a redditor for 3 weeks;) And this is all of your activity to try to discredit a legit project? Yes, Neo Core dev working for us sir. I don't offload any of my aph only hodl sir and commit. I understand, you are just doing your civil duty here sir, thanks for your help sir;) What a joke;) You are helpless. Shall I propose to the pope to make you a saint? This is what you call canonization. Your mission is to scare people off from mega gains. This is epic sir. You are a true helper and a buying signal.
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:24:51
You are welcome. Also be careful , however we are finally in a bull market I believe:)
@_date: 2019-07-01 17:06:56
Classic flyer. So any guess? I hope we will be around 13900$
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:10:57
No side stepping. I don't need any debate. Enough if we got crosschain by end of this year, this will destroy your whole argument with one step.
@_date: 2019-07-03 10:37:35
Bitcoin to the moon! Thanks for your story. Yes, Bitcoin has changed the world and soon it will transform the whole financial world completely.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:33:55
I believe you sir. Probably you are a member then in Nash unofficial TG forum. When I told them that Aph is not dead since someone claimed there that Aph is dead I was banned straight away:)
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:29:43
Sir, How much volume got Nash?:) We are 250$ ahead of Nash. By the way do not focus your Fud work on Aph that much. Our competition is not each other but Libra for God's sake. Sir, Jeff Solinsky , he got a senior position at Amazon sir;) Sir, you are pretty much scared of Aph, hence your activity sir:) you make me laugh.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:46:33
Well, probably you were not so polite. They ban only the worst fudders there sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:46:30
:) Sir, you are a big buy signal, that's all. Nothing to add sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:13:46
Then I am glad sir.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:03:32
Nothing new under the sun:)
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:09:16
Time will tell who is right sir, once we got our Crosschain your word will become nothing sir.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:10:19
If this is true, this might be big news?
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:10:25
Crosschain will be ready by end of this year. Sir, you are clearly very busy fudding us, so we must be a very important project otherwise you and your friend wouldn't provide over 60 comments in this topic. Thanks for making us trending.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:59:59
You have a wild imagination;) Reset my telegram and reddit?:) Why? Who are you?:) Reddit God and TG God? Plus Nostredamus:?&gt;:) Sir, I bought in the dip, I bought originally around 0.49$ or even higher, then I did dca at 38 sats and then I bought not enough at 23 sats, I should have bought more and at lower sats, but now I am willing to buy more at even 120 sats;) sir I believe in this product, is that a sin?:) It looks like it is according to you sir;) you are a buy signal with your friend. However I am fair, I share in our TG channel your response sir. I promote your ideas. No problem. You should share my responses in your Nash Tg channel for fairness sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:06:37
:) Our dex is perfect, I am using it. I have no clue what are you talking about sir. Honestly. I am happy if you achieve some price decline. I wish. So I can buy more.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:09:58
I promote Aph since it is a proper project sir. So I should just let you spread here all kind of baseless accusations sir? Despite of the fact that our Dex is world class and working?:) This is funny isn't it?:) LIkes to lick windows? What does that mean? Nice, I need to propose your canonisation as well with the holy Father sir. You are a proper saint, protecting people from money, from gains;)
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:35:41
Sir, your paid activity shows how priceless is our project sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:57:00
We did already 20% up since we were listed on Bitmart, patience sir;) To be frank I don't want a quick 10x sir, I haven't increased my Aph holding so please fud more sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:34:08
Right, as you can see I am that naive and innocent. I am doing this for free. I am sure you are paid to do this activity. If not then you should be paid or you are just a saint too!
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:11:39
Well, the show must go on, more and more development is going on. Soon we are going to have cross chain and so on by end of year. Watch and learn. The team is working on this magnificient Dex to make it more and more perfect.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:09:32
:) Sir, I am claiming and Ian that by the end of this year Aph is going to have its own crosschain. So you say we won't have. What if we are going to have our own crosschain, then you can admit that everything what you have claimed here is bullshit to put it politely. We can agree on this dear sir;)
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:29:56
You are right on this too.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:53:57
Do your own research and invest into coins which has got great potential. If you want to play safe invest into Bitcoin only , which is the nr 1 coin and big daddy and the pillar of our whole industry. You cannot go wrong with Bitcoin especially if you get in at a very good entry point.
@_date: 2019-07-20 19:11:44
:) Thanks, they are going to use it sir:) We are already at 69 comments sir:) Well, who would fud us freely this much?:)
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:55:06
Well, I am a huge gambler , Sometimes I do double up, double up 4x on black, so you are right once again. However usually I do play only slots. This year I am only £14000 down this year already. This is a great result since it was a month ago £30000 down. So I got £16000 back already.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:12:11
So now you are admitting that Crosschain will happen with Aph too? Before you have claimed , we won't have Crosschain since we supposed to have already cross chain long ago. You haven't heard about delays? Probably you have heard if you are familiar with Nex. When they are going to launch their Dex finally sir?:) You huge amount of reply proves me right, that Aph is a future major player sir. If we wouldn't have a chance to conquer the market, you would not spend this amount of time to try to prove me not correct. Our development process will prove me right sir:) Test our product sir.
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:14:15
I have no clue what are you talking about.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:34:57
Everywhere sir. For example we are going to have cross chain. You are claiming that we won't.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:25:42
You are talking nonesense:) That is obvious. Who said there was 700$ volume today, noone sir. When you commit, you know always how much is the volume through the result, how many Aph you got that day. Check CMC if you want to see our volume. 13$ for today. You are talking nice about Aph, this is your obsession.
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:12:27
Fact is the matter, we are the biggest contender at the moment to be nr 1 Dex sir, if this would not be the case you wouldn't spend here so much time with your friend:) I am happy about our price at the moment sir:) I can buy more cheaper:)
@_date: 2019-07-04 04:59:49
Big daddy, here we come?!!!
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:53:55
Congrat, brilliant advert for Bitcoin and mass adoption as an investment vehicle. Bitconnect was an aweful scam , however I do like Carlos Matos. He is a character and he inspired many classic music song.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:28:56
We are getting there:) I foresee a bullish 2019 and 2020 at least sir.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:23:36
Not good. Every newcomer please be careful. I have Invested into two scammy Ico during the 2018 Ico fever. That cost me £15000 as a start. Anyone who is promising you guaranteed return without a risk must be a scammer or at least , well it is very suspicious.
@_date: 2019-07-03 00:11:55
It is so funny to think of that in 2010 and even in 2011 people used to give away 1 Bitcoin for free actually;) In 2010 for sure.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:26:13
Really?:) Let us make my post trending sir:) Thanks for your hard work.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:03:28
They ban only serious fudders sir. Well all of my price prediction will come to life. Thanks to you and to your friend, it shows and proves that this is a hot topic, we already made 38 comments, thanks for that;) The gains here with Aph sir;) Haven't you realised that?
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:30:16
Please fud us more. I want to buy more at a cheaper prices. We are only increasing sir:)
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:05:27
It is not a hobby. I am a professional gambler, I am earning usually. I have got loads of money from casino. Hencewise I am banned from most of the casinos. Last year I was losing a lot in the bear market but I got loads of money from casino. This year Crypto is good casino is like this, but I am optimistic to get back that £14000 as well and even more. Trend is now again my friend. Finally.
@_date: 2019-07-21 09:13:42
Haha, by the end of this year we are going to have Crosschain too. Good that you agree too in this. Ledger support will be sorted as well, thanks for your contribution sir;)
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:23:53
;) Sir, what if we are going to have Crosschain, then what will you say? You were wrong, or you will say something else why that we won't achieve 1 million $ volume from 300k $ volume ;)
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:27:11
I got that:) However it is already very unlikely to hit 6000$ or even 7000$. Possible but unlikely 15% I would say.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:45:43
Volume will grow sir. Soon we are going to have million dollar volume sir. Thanks for your support.
@_date: 2019-07-03 07:35:23
We are getting there. Our belief in Crypto eventually will be rewarded.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:09:22
What product? It had only a big fat scam.
@_date: 2019-07-22 21:11:08
Fact is that you are and your mate running scared of Aph, you made already nearly 120 comments to my simple news :) That fact is telling more than anything else dear sir;) There is no such thing as bad publicity.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:42:57
Yes. I am a classic hodl and DCa guy myself too. This strategy is amazing this year , however was very bad last year. Last year the shorters were smiling and this year this has changed, apart from recent days when they could short Bitcoin from 13800$ back to 9800$. I know a guy who did short Bitcoin from 12000$ and his positions are still open. I have never liked shorters however in a bear market it is a good strategy and I might learn it in the future or to be long:) End game? Well Bitcoin will hit IMO 30000$ within a year by late June 2020. This would a be good point to sell your Bitcoin and buy it back cheaper. However it is possible that Bitcoin will shoot up to 100k$ so YOU CAN get back only at 40000$ , this is the obvious risk what you face if you sell your precious Bitcoin too early. What I would to do is to use my altcoins/ Bitcoin for products and services once we hit a new Ath. I believe in mass adoption and I want to support that in my own way. I have offered 15% off if someone pays in Crypto on Ebay, however noone ever used this option so far. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-07-03 19:27:29
Brilliant isn't it?:)
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:20:23
:) Time will tell who is right. People will come to us, especially when we got loads of pairs and Eth and Btc trading pairs too sir.
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:09:24
He is just scared of us;) No need for that sir. Be scared of LIbra and not of Aph.
@_date: 2019-07-01 08:26:13
I still believe in the potential of Bitcoin as a payment method and not only as the best assets and digital gold in the world.
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:45:05
Good thinking. I believe that in the future Bitcoin lords will finance and control the world.
@_date: 2019-07-01 18:52:16
You are right. However hopefully Bitcoin will hold 10k otherwise this might get ugly and we might see 7900$ even. Bears got the momentum, shorters are very happy too. Myself I am a hodler and I don't do shorts. So hopefully we are going to see once again a 12000$ Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2019-07-19 22:56:13
Sir, you cannot say I am not fair, I am sharing your accusations and nonesense in our Aph TG channel just to promote your ideas.
@_date: 2019-07-02 14:49:16
Wow, you are mega lucky and potentially very rich. Good luck!
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:08:16
Thanks for the advert. Well, there is no such a thing as bad publicity. I do understand that you are very scared of Aph sir;) We have a working product, nothing changes this fact. Also we are at 612k market cap;) This makes us the most undervalued project in the whole space. I would bet with anyone that from this point we can make 100x easier than any other project;)
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:41:48
Well, we have a product sir, this is the mistake in your logic. Aph dex is working perfectly. Commit sir, commit your Aph token, thanks.
@_date: 2019-07-04 06:53:24
Wow:) Hip hip hurray;)
@_date: 2019-07-18 22:34:08
Hopefully they are going to stop Libra, however it is unlikely. Facebook has paid too much money for too many influencers. I would be happy Mark to support Libra for £9000 a month. Later my price will increase sir!:)
@_date: 2019-07-19 21:50:51
If this would be the case, then you would not be so active like you are now to prove me not right:) Sorry sir, your effort is not effective. We are going to conquer this market:)
@_date: 2019-07-02 17:48:43
Bitcoin is the asset. Most powerful asset in modern world. Best performing asset also at the moment. Nothing like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:17:42
:) Sir, I am perfectly happy about the price sir;) Also sorry, but our Admin asked me not to post there your smart comments sir. I am happy that you are an insider and knows everything about our listing and partnerships and so on:) You are doing this very hard:) You are the perfect example why to buy into this. I guess Eth at the beginning was facing this much Fud like we face right now;)
@_date: 2019-07-19 23:04:15
Pretty much everywhere. I told them to come here. I don't like to deal all of the fudders here alone.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:29:46
YEah, but the only problem is that the bear market has finished already with 2018, 2019 is a bull market. :) In order to say that we are in a bear market we should break 3120$ first, I think that is super super super unlikey. I would be happy to bet with anyone in this. The odds would favour me so much.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:27:53
I am not sure that Bitcoin is going down to 9k ever in the next 2 years. Maybe you have 20% chance to buy at 8900$ overall.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:25:09
Mass adoption is already happening. Please don't listen to fake news but to real ones. Soon Warren Buffett is adopting Bitcoin too.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:24:08
Bitcoin will be mass adopted. If you have Bitcoin means you are rich. High Bitcoin dominance is good news to the alt holders as well long term. Alt season is coming, it is actually under way already.
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:45:51
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:17:53
Bull market confirmed. 3120$ was the bottom. I don't believe in 5k anymore. 5k? I guess you would never bet on it, since that is also extremely unlikely. I would say 1% for 5k and I would say 0.1% for 2k$ :)
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:21:34
Nice, soon, 30000$ by late June next year. My expectation.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:22:54
I used to use Coinbase Pro to buy Bitcoin , for altcoins I am happy to use even Binance or Kucoin, or even Hotbit, or Bilaxy or Aphelion Dex to buy Aph or Neo. I am looking for a new 0% maker fee exchange where I can buy Bitcoin for Fiat. Coinbase Pro is not 0% maker fee exchange anymore. Unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:16:32
You are lucky if you can buy around 10300$. It is very unlikely that we are ever going to see anything below 6000$ , also we have a chance that we are never going to see anything below 8900$ neither. I know, I know the bears still believe in their 2000$ Bitcoin price. Let us keep them in their delusion:)
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:48:50
I think, it is pretty slow to realise and pretty much late to realise for  a trader or for anyone who wants massive gains that we are in a bull market once Bitcoin finally reached all time high:) In my textbook we have grown from 3120$ to 13800$ and we are still above 10k confidently. It is bullish , very bullish. Also 2k$ will never happen regardless. Would bet with anyone in that. Nothing can bring Bitcoin to as low as 2k$ not even an outright ban by USA I believe. So for you only a new all time high would mean that we are in a bull market?:) Even Tone Vays hasn't got the nerve to say anymore that this is a bear market;)
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:20:21
You are good, if you hodl your Bitcoin, you are doing pretty good. 30000$ by late June 2020. Moderate prediction. We are in a bull market.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:51:45
I think the Lightning Network is advancing pretty well. Everyone is working hard in the background to achieve mass adoption, which can be good to the Crypto market overall. Only challenge what I can see really is Libra. Not happy about Facebook really. It is a huge opportunity for mass adoption and a huge challenge at the same time.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:38:35
True, Einstein would approve your observation too. Soon we are going to hit 30k too. Within a year sir.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:24:40
Who would say such a stupid thing?:) Bitcoin not going to 0$ nor to 2000$ :) That is a pure nonesense.
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:26:40
Nice, good luck man. Bitcoin is the new digital gold. I should have listen to my wife, who told me to invest 50% of the money into Bitcoin purely and keep in it and not to buy with it altcoins too early;)
@_date: 2019-06-30 23:19:20
This is natural, especially if you are beginner. Well, you know, you should have bought at 3120$ and in January and February or March. However just to encourage you I believe that by next year late June we are going to see 30000$ Bitcoin price at one point. I expect new all time high.
@_date: 2018-12-13 11:30:55
Yeah. We are at the most brilliant entry point for many many projects such as Yggdrash for example and many other altcoins too. Ladies and gentlemen it is time to get your ticket on the moon train. Or do you want to go to the Mars rather?:)
