| With PoW, you only need to choose the right software once,
You assume no hardforks or softforks then? I doubt there is much *real* difference between the two on weak subjectivity.
Related to the topic, I find VBs take on "camp spawning" very interesting.  Seems like a substantial flaw in PoW to be honest:

Prediction, Bitcoin will be at 70% within the year
@_date: 2017-03-24 07:01:51
I have seen them, they dont compare. Oh how the mighty have fallen.
@_date: 2017-03-27 15:41:57
It is not shit because you own some. So obvious it is embarrassing...
@_date: 2017-03-16 10:34:07
You misread, the dog is Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:16:35
Unlike PoW, that can run on thin air??? Right?  The amount of shit people pulls out of their asses at this sub....
@_date: 2017-03-13 18:10:13
This is a joke, right?
@_date: 2017-04-19 19:25:40
You should not be so worried about the value of your time.
@_date: 2017-04-18 15:53:46
It might have something to do with the skill gap between you.
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:26:47
I just think you just confirmed it. Thanks. :)
@_date: 2017-04-18 20:21:13
Perhaps in next life, you make better choices. Then you won't come out as a total crybaby.
@_date: 2017-05-21 16:38:31
not true at all. most exchanges have eth/usd/eur pairs.
@_date: 2017-05-14 21:47:42
5 minues;  they are slow, but will eventually get around
@_date: 2017-05-31 16:21:35
This is intended behaviour of bitcoin according to the elite at blockstream. It is a feature...
@_date: 2017-05-14 00:19:15
His issues are valid, your answer was not.
@_date: 2017-05-15 20:11:09
there u are

I don't think it is possible to underestimate the power and impact of all these memes! They really show that this subreddit is a serious place, not some shit-sub like @_date: 2017-07-04 22:31:41
As someone who watched PeterTodd Luke and Maxwell gloat over the eth/etc split, this is hilarious. So much for the "stability" of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:48:17
thought you got banned for posting such topics here? new policy?
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:47:23
and use nano s or trezor...  Still, you are subject to fake input addresses altered on your browser.
@_date: 2017-06-23 20:59:39
Is this one of the "you can post without getting banned about ethereum if you say something negative"....  yes, it is.  I have heard bad things about eth for 3 years here, good thing I didn't listen to that shit.  Would have cost me some serious money.
@_date: 2017-06-16 23:23:13
probably because they don't give the "right" answer
@_date: 2017-06-06 22:36:02
what OS? Windows 10?  What does the anti-virus scan say?
@_date: 2017-06-09 23:05:54
I mean, it is perhaps more likely that some plugin-extention did it?
@_date: 2017-06-09 21:02:48
What was the extention.  And is it "repeatable", if you test it now?
