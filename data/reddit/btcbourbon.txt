Oh wow.

CME launch. Much larger boatload of investors
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:58:42
Correct. Cash settled. But good likelihood investors hedging their bets by selling their own BTC and/or buying it up.

5PM Sunday CBOE starts. Much lower volume than the impending CME 12/18. 
Edit: 5PM Central I believe

I'll be impressed if their "BTC expert" commentator BK points out the difference it BCash gets brought up. Then again after his fail demonstrating how to purchase BTC via Coinbase a few weeks back ;)

Yep! I appreciate that he supports crypto and was an early adopter for CNBC but disappointing he chose the wrong side of history 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:12:01
Haha really hope so ;)
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:40:06
Think you mean HODL ;)
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:04:33
Yea just saw that ugh. In before confusing layfolk with BCash ...

Haha good on Melissa Lee to attempt to pigeonhole him into focus on Bitcoin. Course he went straight to Bcash within ten seconds and said he was concerned bout Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:36:45
Doesnt help that BK threw down and said there might be more potential with BCash too .. dumb money to potentially pump

I agree and think we're on the same page for the most part. Just want to note that they can use actual BTC on an actual BTV exchange (e.g. any bought BTC during this recent run up from 8k -&gt; 19.5k; regular 5BTC per 30sec bot that's likely institutional investors) and mass sell to cause a drop to hedge their short on Futures. Or perhaps pump up BTC to prop their longs. 
Personally do think CFTC allowing futures legitimizes BTC so less likely to get a firm U.S. ban now unless they royally f it up
In any case for the newbs ... be cautious, BTFD, and HODL ;)
