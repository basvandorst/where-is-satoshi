I don't think the black hole is a legitimate threat. I'm totally guessing here but in order for transaction to take place, both the recepient of the bitcoin and the giver of the bitcoin have to agree. 
Why would the giver agree to give money to a black hole? Black holes don't give anything back in return.
If the black hole is just removing transactions, then its blockchain will be shorter and therefore not considered.
Really just guessing here, but, it seems to me for the black hole to do any damage, it would have to take over 51% of the compute power.
So, again, if the 51% attack is worrying you, install miners on your computers.

Define "the price go up" - time scale?
Your question is a proof that language allows for reasonably sounding, completely ambiguous (possibly dumm) questions.

Agree with lordgilman. 
The only concrete "attack" you mentioned is the 51% attack.  To help counter that TODAY, start a bitcoin miner on your computer now and join a mining pool.
I challenge the OP to come with ANY other concrete type of attack, and then we'll figure a way to counter it.

Yes, foreseeing large amounts of incoming funds, the site added 2 factor authentication in the newest release.

What do you mean "still" Starlightbreaker ? This is the premiere exchange of crypto in this world. Go see the link, if you are a trader, of course.

Yeah, this is what is great about crypto. You can invent new solutions and incentives. Without being bogged down by silly regulation (actually not silly but usually downright stacked against you, my man)

Regarding ahem retirement plan, not exactly, but a lot closer to it after the MCX fee shares tripled overnight.

Well let me tell you, once upon a time, you could earn interest on fiat. Those were the times ;)
@_date: 2013-10-28 21:33:24
yeah, cool beans, esp. part 1.
Part 2, I don't get what is the connection???

Your deductive capacity is unbelievable.
