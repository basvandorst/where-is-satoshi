Craig's thesis has appeared in the CSU library dated February 2017, so presumably his PhD has now been awarded.
[The quantification of information systems risk: A look at quantitative responses to information security issues / Craig Wright](

In Australia at least, making a thesis available in the university library is one of the very last steps and is only done once the thesis has been examined, amended if necessary, and accepted by the university. I appreciate that might not convince you, but a university releasing a thesis before it's examined just isn't done, they are kept under strict embargo until accepted. So, regardless of the process, Wright seems to have been awarded his PhD now.
It's also been placed into the research output database of the university [here]( The database is meant to contain "the final accepted, post peer-reviewed and pre-publication manuscript", so I think that it's reasonable to take that as confirmation.
Either way, it's out now and people can make their own judgements on its quality. Just skimming it I can see a sign error in Eq (5) on page 80, and a mistake in Eq (6) on page 81 (I think he means N_i(T) not N(t)) so clearly the examiners were not very careful.

I have to disagree that there's no need for any additional papers. There was a lot of disagreement with that claim from people who are reasonably knowledgeable, so I don't think it's clear at all that bitcoin script can be used to simulate a two-stack PDA. I'm not expert enough to be sure who is right.
In any case, if it were Turing complete the unequivocal proof would be to write a Turing machine in Script. That would settle it once and for all. Since this hasn't been done (that I know of) it seems unlikely to be true.

Where was that from please?
@_date: 2018-02-18 01:56:04
That's why I said "in some sense". It was never clear to me what the specific claim was, so I am trying to find out if there is any new information.
The two teams were nChain/CSW and Ryan Charles &amp; Clemens Ley.
@_date: 2018-02-18 03:34:03
Almost certainly - I am asking if there's been any update on those **claims**.
@_date: 2017-07-07 04:04:14
Wow ok, my mistake!

His name isn't listed, just the job title, but there is only one deputy commissioner.
Edit: I'm wrong, there are several.

What is written in the article is




The symbol he uses is the "implies" symbol. Nothing in the above makes any sense mathematically. He is trying to say that the statement "an increase in P implies an increase in MV" is equivalent to "P ⇒ MV". P, M and V are continuous variables, not Booleans, so it makes no sense to use logical symbols to relate them. It is hopelessly garbled. Presumably he does mean
P = MV
and as you say &amp; &amp;asymp; &amp; V + M &amp;
Edit: furthermore the units in his
&amp; = 0.962 V
make no sense. &amp; would be units of money (dollars or whatever), 0.962 is a ratio so is a pure number and V is velocity of money which has units of 1/time.

I agree, that is probably part of the motivation. They are out the $15m they already paid for his worthless IP. Robert MacGregor already either left or was booted from nCrypt.

He was completely lying. Here is his old CV that says he did a PhD at CSU from 2009-2012.
You don't get to claim you have a PhD **five years** before it's actually awarded.

No it wasn't - look at the metadata, it was OpenOffice formatted to resemble latex.
@_date: 2017-07-04 13:55:30
I can't say I agree. Claiming to have been awarded a PhD when it's actually still in progress is highly dishonest.
By the way, I looked up what an official transcript looks like. It would clearly state the degree and date of conferral.
@_date: 2017-07-23 03:27:30
Either nChain are in on the con, Craig has them bamboozled, or some mixture of these. Nobody remotely competent could fail to see through this nonsense pretty quickly. I imagine the people under the nChain "chief scientist" have already worked out that their team leader is a crackpot but want to keep their jobs. Employees of his company in Sydney essentially said that already - ["best conman I've ever met"](

It's not a screenshot, it's text and you can search it for PhD and find it about 3/4 of the way down.
"Charles Sturt University
PhD, Computer Science
2009 – 2012"
The transcript doesn't necessarily mean it was completed in 2014 because once you submit your thesis, while you are still considered a student you don't have to keep enrolling while it's being examined. Even if he did get it in 2014, his CV was still wrong.
The absolute proof is right in his thesis. The signature on page 10 is dated 8 Feb 2017. That is the date of the final version that would have been submitted after changes recommended by the examiners. He can't have been awarded it before that date.
Edit: as someone else pointed out, normally a transcript would have the actual date of conferral printed on it, which that one does not.

The honest thing to do would be to list the year you started until the year it was awarded, since the conferral date is the "official" date that candidature ends.
By saying PhD 2009-2012 he was suggesting that he had already been awarded the PhD, even though it was still in progress.

He also said in the bitcoin panel in Las Vegas in Oct 2015 that he had "a couple of doctorates" - see 1:20 at
He has it on his profile at the Conversation
He also claimed it in Andrew O'Hagan's article
I could go on...

The 0.962 comes from here:


So over a year,
∆M/M = 657000/(16.5*10^6) = 0.03981818182 ≈ 4%
1 - ∆M/M = 1 - 657000/(16.5*10^6) = 0.9601818182 ≈ 0.962 in round figures.
But I can't see any way to reconcile his ∆P = 0.962 V expression with P = MV/Y. Earlier in the article he says (in a convoluted way) that he's assuming Y is constant, and I suppose he is also assuming V constant but I don't see that stated. The best I can do is
P' = M' V/Y (assuming Y and V constant) so
∆P ≈ ∆M V/Y
I can only conclude that this is hopelessly garbled.

Filed by the ATO deputy commissioner on 13 April 2017.
This is the same deputy commissioner who was just charged with tax fraud (nothing to do with Wright as far as I know).
Edit: I'm wrong, there are several deputy commissioners, I don't know which one actually filed.
