One of the best analogies I have been able to give over the past couple years is that BTC and the crypto market as a whole are a micro cap stock relative to other assets that are store of value. Adoption, adoption, adoption is your answer. Look at a stock with a market capitalization under, $500m versus a megacap stock that has a MC greater than $100b. My order of 1m shares on a micro cap is going to make serious noise versus placing a 1m share order on XOM or MSFT. BTC and the crypto markets are a micro cap stock at best when the broader asset classes hold the following values: Broad Money Value = $80 trillion, Stock Markets = $70 trillion, Banknotes and Deposits aka Fiat = $30 trillion, Gold = $8 trillion and now to Crypto $250 billion. There is much more stability in proven and adopted markets. If you look at any of the other values mentioned here and move some of that to crypto, you will see a tremendous shift in stability. The bigger it gets, the harder it is for these wild swings to be considered "natural." Hope that eases your mind. But for now, we are nowhere near those values.

I like these comparisons. I have one here as well:

To add to his point, net exports is one of four factors of GDP which signals the total production of our economy for goods and services purchased. Signifies the health of economy. So greater exports should improve GDP.  
Government Spending + Consumption + Investments + Net Exports (Exports - Imports) = GDP

I agree with others that this comparison is not really applicable to what it is trying to convey. Maybe comparing that while cryptomarket is 264b, broad money is around 90 trillion, stock markets are 70 trillion, banknotes and deposits around 30 trillions, gold 8 trillion, coins and banknotes 5 trillion...etc in the following:

Search Bitcoin IRA and I believe a company out of California should pop up. I reached out to them back in 2016 and I think the transfer in was somewhere around $10/15k minimum. Could have changed though.

Coinbase Pro is about 95% cheaper on trades. Coinbase is criminal in the fees they assess.

Well, back in late 2017 and early 2018 we saw it rise to $830b in market capitalization. This is the retail market at work as well.
In the United States, pension plans manage about $18 trillion based off data I pulled from MMD. Majority of these plans invest in a wide variety of asset classes to diversity their risk. More of these plans are deviating away from the 70/30 split of investing in stocks/bonds. It is more of a 60/30/10. 60% in stocks, 30% in bonds &amp; 10% in alternative assets such as, private equity firms other types of strategies that the average retail investor can not partake in. Where this ties in, if you take that 10% of $18 trillion, you have about $1.8 trillion in alternative assets that could be utilized for crypto's. So lets say a quarter goes to crypto, you add $500b right there with ease.
I look over at the institutional investment managers, and they manage close to $80 trillion among: stocks, bonds, private equity, real estate and derivatives. If you were to take a modest 10% of these monies and apply to crypto, you add $8 trillion right here.
It is hard to see where it could go without the right perspective. Luckily, being in institutional sales, I have heard some of the prominent investment forums discussing crypto as an asset class to offer up to their clients. These numbers given here today only apply to U.S. pensions and investment managers. When you apply these thoughts to a global scale, the space looks even bigger. So, I could easily see the crypto space at around $10 trillion dollars in 10-15 years which would be roughly 40x the size today.
I am a HODL'r and accumulating as much as I can prior to the expansion into the institutional market place. I suggest you consider these findings as well as you formulate your own opinion and enact on it.
Hope it helps!

Well, to your point, I think you are not looking at the comparison from a wide enough lens. If it helps the reader compare, then the graph has done its job.
I would say that my thoughts are geared at the sheer potential and I would rather compare crypto to the largest asset classes such as the stock market as a whole which is denominated in fiat. Replace this fiat with crytpo and you have my thought process.
Both are good for comparisons but I think one, here, is setting the bar way too low.

Bitscreener allows you to add each transaction by coin on that specific date for that price. Good way to review your portfolio as a whole and look into the gain/loss of each coin within the portfolio.

Again, to each their own. Your appetite for risk is not as great as a leveraged trader. That’s, ok. 
I want to agree with you that it’s impossible to time the market but, do something enough over an extended period of time, you probably have a better sense of what is to come. I still haven’t figured this out yet myself but when I do, I will share it with you my friend.

That stems from the question of how risk averse you are. To each their own.

So...you mean the YouTube ad that pops up all the time showing the guy who turned $500 into $1,000,000 is full of &amp;\^%$? If he can do it, why can't I?  /s

Technically you are right but the graph itself only pulls from January as the naked eye can see. Good to know you had nothing else better to do than point that out.
