You sound fun at parties

You spent a little money and got back far more than you invested - hard to see anything wrong with that. Congrats!

Non-sociopath: being a profitable business is not incompatible with circling around the struggling poor like vultures.

Glad everybody on here has a good sense of humour

Most banks in other non-US, first world countries.

This is actually way bigger than news than BIC, there’s a Yamada in pretty much every town

I've lived (and held bank accounts) in five countries and never experienced anything like the aforementioned fee. The US banks have just made these predatory tactics seem normal to you.

So 5 garages in a small city.

"Japan has made it a mainstream national currency, everyone there is accepting it or investing in it."
Utter bullshit. Nope, they aren't. There might be exchanges, but in a year of living here, I've seen three stores that accept it and only within conservative amounts. 
Japan is actually fairly luddite and will only accept technology that's commonplace in other countries in a kicking and screaming manner. They barely have internet banking and fax machines are still the norm in the average office.

Hitting a little close to home?
You can laugh at a joke whilst disagreeing with the underlying politics.

Hard logic there
@_date: 2018-01-09 02:46:48
Not fake news, but certainly a bunch of PR fluff pieces that rarely came to fruition or were cancelled when companies realized how unusable it currently is as a commercial currency.
The exchange, mining markets etc here may bigger than in other countries but mainstream adoption is fuck all, even compared to the west.
BTC isn't even on the radar of the vast, overwhelming majority of Japanese people.

This seems like something my dad would email me embedded into a Word document
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:35:13
I live in Japan, no it's not.

Congratulations man, I know the threshold for success on here has shifted to lambos but I'll be ecstatic if I could just pay off my credit card and buy a Nintendo Switch or something.

Yes, ther's a tiny handful in only the major cities, hardly widespread usage.
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:07:24
Take a breath, mate.

Great level of discourse around here.
@_date: 2018-02-17 12:27:18
Hard to influence anybody if you can’t string together a coherent sentence.

Did you actually read the article or just eat triggered by the word ‘women’?
The article was exclusively about women engineers already interested in blockchain despite the juvenile maturity level of the industry. It’s no secret that crypto is largely a bunch of adult virgins.

They didn't do any mining 'on Teslas', just used some publicly accessible cloud servers that belong to Tesla.

I like that we're just adding the Bitcoin logo to memes that 'Live Love Laugh' parents post on Facebook.
