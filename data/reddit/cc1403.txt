Don't matter as long as licensing, payroll taxes, and the electric bill can be paid the same way. But they can't. This is the same thing as a corner store that won't accept credit cards because they can't eat the 3% fee. They are plentiful.

LOL were you around in 2007/2008. Obama wasn't president and the stimulus money was flowing into was street like wine.

Main Street can finally invest in the underworld without having to break knees. Plenty of value in that. Walter White is no longer needed.

Or more like the store that won't take checks because they lose a percentage of revenue on the ones that bounce... and I'm not saying that Bitcoin is not stable. I'm saying the price has to be stable, from the time the product is moved from the creator to the distribution to the customer, and all have been paid. Bitcoin hasn't necessarily provided that.

Customer buys game, transaction canceled do to inflation, customer is pissed. With fiat customer is pissed at the government. Decentralized customer is pissed at the seller? Pissed off customers are a problem, stable currency is paramount.

Mining is maintaining the network correct? What incentive do miners have for doing this computing after the last Bitcoin has been created?

You're misunderstanding me. That's what I mean. If it goes up because people think it's supposed to go up, then get out. If it goes up because it is producing value for people that's different. In my case I can make overnight transactions that used to take weeks, that's new value.

I know I was being nit picky, but I'm new to the community. I started using bitcoin for some regular purchases and found myself holding a small amount in a wallet for convenience. I figure if I'm going to be a Bitcoin person I may as well get to know and understand it's utility and it's user base as much as possible.

That says UK right? Pretty sure all currencies are a strong buy if you're money is in Pounds.

It is fallacious to think gold will go up in value over time because that's what it's done for the last 100 years. Or because it dropped from 1800 to 1200 so it has to come back at some point. But just "to think gold will go up in value over time" is not a fallacy in itself. It is a speculation.

2013 was a bubble

"•Three years with no major bubbles, I mean come on this used to happen all the time, we're long overdue."
I'm a regular on r/poker. This is called the gambler's fallacy. Nothing is 'due'. Or, like you read in a stock prospectus 'past performance is no indication of future results.' The next bubble is a bubble because there's no reason for it. If there were a reason, then it wouldn't be a bubble.

It seems to me like everyone is overly concerned with how many people are buying BTC. This is what trading volume and market cap are measuring right? That's all well and good for investors, but it seems to me like a GWP is a much better measure of long term value of your holdings. If more companies and people accept bitcoin as payment for real world goods and services, those on the ground floor stand to make more on their savings than in all the speculative bubbles to date.
