1.  Yes it will work.  Bittrex batches their withdraws though, usually takes between 5-60 minutes for them to send.  But, they send with a large  miner fee, so you will get in the next block after they send.
2. It will always arrive at the current price of btc at the moment. 
3.  No real risks, as long as you make sure to copy paste the address correctly.

Paxful, if you can accept the terrible rates that they give.  I sell as well, can use Facebook Messenger payments which allow PayPal and/or debit cards, at current rate.

Only if they give the info, you have to ask the person/company running the ATM

Ah, thats does suck.  Thats terrible of them.

No, that is not normal.  It is normal that it might not have a confirmation, but you should at least see it after 4 hours in your wallet.

Just make sure to use 2FA, and you should be fine.  I use my phone on Bittrex also, no issues, other than it takes a little getting used to visually wise.

It isnt confirming because the fee was less than 18 sat/b.  That is insanely low.  That may never confirm.

No, but if you know the seed, you can get a list of every address that is in your wallet both now and in the future.

If you know the wallet seed words, go download electrum, and enter the words into there.  It should restore your wallet.

Why they would send a 28k batch tx with a 2,00 dollar fee is ridiculous.

We worked with Betcoin in the past, and this is not 100%, but I know people pretty close to the source, and I trust them.....
I do not believe anyone bought them, they are simply getting rid of poker.  They lost a lot of money recently, and instead of dealing with it, they made a deal to exit the agreement with WPN, as they were on the hook for a ton of money.
They have been getting pretty shady as of late, and the glitch they had was probably the straw that broke their back.  Now they are trying to make it look like they are selling to someone, to get the heat off of themselves.
That is my opinion, with the little bit of info I have.  Take it as that, an opinion.

You can still send an unconfirmed tx from your wallet to yourself.  Well, most wallets will let you.  I know electrum lets you.
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:48:44
Is your payment one of the larger ones?
If so, you could send it to yourself, with a higher fee, trying to do a modified CPFP tx.

Someone should report to your financial aid department or lender that you are gambling your aid, so it gets revoked.  This is one of the single handedly dumbest things I have seen someone do in recent memory.

My atms arent through this company, but on mine, it shows you the amount of btc youbwill receive after each bill you insert.  Then you can cancel if you dont like the rate.

I do this locally in st. Louis.  More as a favor since my bar also has a bitcoin atm, and people always ask about using it. 
@_date: 2018-10-26 19:44:50
Then you are an idiot. The atms are easy to use. And they always show what you get. Period.
