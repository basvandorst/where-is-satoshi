I really like bitcoinity.org as well as bitcoinwisdom.com
Both have highly customizable views and should be able to track historical data back several years.

Like was mentioned above, it sounds like the initial email you got might have been fake, the link provided could have been for a phishing site that then stole your login info. When you clicked the link in the initial email did you actually log you into your account through it? Or did it take you to a login screen where it replied with like "invalid login, incorrect password" etc. After entering your credentials. 
What really worries me is seeing the slew of subsequent logins from Russia after you reacted to the initial email...
Check the sender address for the initial email, or post the email message headers (if you're familiar with how to do that). Someone here should be able to tell you if it was a legit message from them or not.

Looks like they're having DNS issues, and are aware of it:

I really don't understand why everyone insists on arguing with to you so vehemently every time you post here. I find what you're doing very interesting and good for you for doing what you enjoy. If people don't agree with your decisions that's fine, but they don't have to attack you as if what you're doing affects them in any way whatsoever :P
Are you still using the excess energy to do hydroponic greenhouse farming? Or are you now just straight up mining? I really enjoyed reading about the entire greenhouse operation in the last post.

awesome, thanks guys!  I'll make sure to keep in touch with you guys when I feel comfortable enough with the development that I open the site to the public. I plan on opening registration for artists immediately after launch.
