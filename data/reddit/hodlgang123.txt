So the real question is why you asked a stranger for advice about setting up a wallet 
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:36:22
Wonder why they fomo in for you and not just send all your crypto to an account? Why have access and do something like make a purchase  they know will be pending. I'm sure they would have just emptied existing accounts knowing your account does not have instant transaction. I am 100% backer of coinbase. I would like to see the official outcome of this. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 19:44:19
Serious markets? I'm sorry please elaborate.
@_date: 2018-05-26 15:00:30
Only 32 pre mined pieces of glass very limited supply
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:49:38
Haha!  Mine was around 250 (+/- 50).  I remember that number simply because 1 molly = 0.2 BTC :P.  
It wasn't even a conscious "investment" ... was holding it to buy stuff.  Yeap .. BTC really was used as a currency then.
@_date: 2018-08-09 23:51:37

I was thinking the same wonder if he will drop in today. I have a feeling he won't :)
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:42:54
All I'm saying is why can't he show anything  at all. It would be nothing for him to show us 10 btc if he has capital as he claims. If not he's doesn't have a lot to puss in
@_date: 2018-05-27 20:19:09
I highly doubt u have more than a couple hundred bucks to your name. My guess is u sold probably around  .02 btc at 7500 after buying at 9k now your are looking to use "trolling powers" to drive prices down so u can claim u made money shorting bitcoin. You lost for sure if not prove your emense wealth.

Can we agree these puzzles are shames remember anyone who has money to give to strangers also have family friends acquaintances that would also like a "handout". It is hard to believe people are giving money out to random reddit users and not actually people in there own lives which leads be to believe it is alot like a Facebook post with a pile of cash saying like and share and this could be yours or possibly actual money laundering. The fact is we will never really know who gives and gets the money like others have said it could very well be the same person and we would never be able to prove otherwise. I love the idea but honestly not realistic.

Agreed the pain has been real for shortimers. I felt this way the end of last year sold out and watched it go to 20k. I'm experiencing similar feeling now. I have been buying dips to watch them loose % but I know i will regret the sale as I did last year so I sit and wait buy couple hundred worth every new dip and hope for the best.

I've always in the recent past advocated for coinbase and at times still do good product. Great tool for making profitable trades on forks get new coin dumps not good for being on cutting edge but.... they do work very hard I believe to keep us from being "cut". They are very responsible in this very new age of digital tech, which I believe will protect us in the long run.

@_date: 2018-03-14 22:24:15
I got into bitcoin and other cryptos to try to save a bit of a nest egg with the hopes that I could see my investment grow I've seen ups and downs but honestly if I do well I hope to use some as a down payment on a home and the rest for my  kids college education. I think lambos are great but I believe most people with 200k would find other ways to spend it to help improve the lives of the people around them. If we would spread more down to earth finacial dreams of ours we may find more support. And hopefully make it harder for tv personalities to make fun of us. Any financial dreams of yours u would like to share?  
@_date: 2019-01-17 02:48:32
Look at what bitcoin actually is compared to other "tech" stocks i.e Netflix  Facebook. And compare the inovation. The potential bitcoin and crypto has  if we could grab a percentage of that market cap.

I think bitcoin is gaining acceptance and is in a good position to respond to failures of governments as we can see politicians and politics are arkaik governments of old now can be simply replaced with a kiosk incert code to manage said laws and let ai do the work. They are in a power struggle trying to gain acceptance from new generation but fail to to. We are no longer looking to leaders as all knowing trustworthy respectable people u are all flawed and and I think persons will look to technology for future leadership knowing it is not bound by such a primitive processor.

Keep in mind how humble that generation is. They will work rather than accept government help. They will say things like I choose to be hear some may be honest but I would imagine most folks would rather see themselves spending time differently in the golden years. Let's say most did not envision there retirement this way.

Undercover millionaire at your local grocery store.    Get this story 20 20 60 minutes would pay mightily  ohh wait they told you they are extremely wealthy? You know them to be extremely wealthy? Not so undercover and not likely behavior of a actual wealthy person to tell everyone coming through the doors of Wal-Mart about there vast amounts of wealth.
@_date: 2018-12-10 21:45:07

What if later in the future we do find exchanges are trading against their clients. I understand pull coins from exchanges but could that hurt a potential participation in a class action lawsuit. If they are currently trading against us.
@_date: 2018-12-16 16:55:55
I agree nothing's wrong with work completely and whole heartedly but I also believe the buy power these poor folks once had has been undermined by inflation and was curious if you think this loss of buying power will be experienced buy us as well.
@_date: 2018-12-11 21:52:32
