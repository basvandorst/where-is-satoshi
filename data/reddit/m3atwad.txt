some people like their cucumbers pickled 
@_date: 2018-01-16 04:35:41
that's a good way to lose more
@_date: 2018-01-24 17:56:37
Why does everyone repeat "it has to see 8k low" ad naseum.  If everyone believed that they'd all just sell out and rebuy there.  which hasn't happened..so..
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:13:49
 hoping we get down to ~650B market cap so I can comfortably smash the buy button 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:55:21
Erm, most people didn't expect 20k till the end of the summer earliest.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:23:41
Didn't quite reach it still got to shop a couple sales though
@_date: 2018-01-08 18:22:46
what if it ends up like apples stock chart tho?
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:51:02
In a crypto subreddit talking about bank accounts, I don't think you get it.
@_date: 2018-01-08 16:20:32
the crypto market was way into overvalued territory it was at +800B on cmc.  Much more comfortable in the 660-700B range
@_date: 2018-01-24 19:19:04
So you think there's a fundamental value at 8k?! Interesting...   
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:49:50
Historically mid-late January is a fantastic time to buy.   So, maybe?  Personally I added to all my crypto positions early this morning.

Gdax is the actual exchange for coinbase.  Go to gdax.com and link your coinbase account.  USD/BTC/LTC/ETH transfers from coinbase-Gdax or vice versa are free and instant.
@_date: 2017-12-17 05:07:00
You can buy it on coinbase and then transfer it to a wallet that's fine. If you leave your bitcoin on the coinbase website you don't have control of the keys.  Read about Mt. Gox  
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:24:02
True.  It's probably not worth it just cause now he's the dick his boss and to pay in bitcoin.  If you were lazy and didn't really care enough it could be worth it, I guess?
@_date: 2017-12-26 17:51:11
that's a bit odd I just transferred from gdax to binance this morning took about 20 mins
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:56:31
Dividend ReInvestment Plan.  You can use DRIP for any stock you own that pays dividend.  Instead of receiving a cash dividend your broker will give you an equivalent amount of stock(usually a fraction of a share).  You can probably find it somewhere in your account settings.  I don't believe you will have to pay tax on the dividend this way, until you sell the underlying stock of course.

You can't just look at a chart and draw lines and say yep, uh oh, thats a head and shoulders Robert Downy Jr. chocolate eclair..Understand the catalyst behind each downturn and decide whether or not they're overblown in the long term.

Just a guy offering sound financial advice.
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:43:44
Depends which echo chamber you subscribe to.  No one knows what will happen.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:22:41
they use the fees from coinbase to subsidize gdax transfers.
edit: They're the same company
@_date: 2017-12-25 01:20:43
gdax is free homie
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:15:35
GDAX to anywhere is free(they pay it) seems to take about 30 mins-3 hours in my experience.  Is instant to coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:43:35
no but I just withdraw btc to my hardware wallet for $0.  took about 2 hours.  use gdax.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:15:15
I imagine for him simply hastling with his boss 1 time is worth not having to deposit cash, transfer to an exchange then purchase bitcoin every 2 weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:21:16
A stop order at a price of 400 would trigger the sell when the price of ltc is below 400.  So i imagine it just immediately sold? You were looking to place a limit sell order I assume?
Edit: place stop orders below the current trading price if you're worried about a crash
@_date: 2017-12-06 16:19:31
just had a nice dip to 12.5k
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:58:26
Don't know.  You can set a limit sell at whatever price you want which will trigger once it hits.  Or wait till it goes over 400 then set a stop loss/limit at whatever price you're comfortable at.  Stop loss will trigger a market sell order(might trigger significantly lower than where you set it but most likely will trigger), stop limit will attempt to sell at that exact price(won't always trigger)
@_date: 2017-12-13 18:15:46
Limit order you enter the exact price you're willing to pay for btc.  If the market moves to your price it goes through.  Market order is guaranteed to go through but you will always pay the ask price or if selling receive the bid price.  Google "Bid/Ask spread"
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:21:54
yeah it took me about 2 hours I believe.  Others are reporting 30 mins-6 hours. I strongly encourage you to use Segwit
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:25:06
no fees if you use gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:03:36
Sales using what? He could've transferred btc to the bars address for free in 30 mins-6 hours using gdax
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:05:36
You mean you would like to buy with a limit order.  You should use gdax.com
@_date: 2017-12-26 18:08:47
@_date: 2018-08-03 05:07:45
At no point this year was bitcoin anywhere near 5200
@_date: 2018-08-05 03:35:21
put your orders wherever you like I'm just letting you know you can likely get a lower buy then 5200
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:59:35
There is 0 support at 5200 tho lol unless you plan on dropping 10 mil there I wouldnt't expect it to stop there on its way to the 4ks
@_date: 2018-08-03 05:05:05
longing Tesla would've been a much better play
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:36:02
You are emotionally invested in $100??  Sell now dude That is not even worth 5 minutes of anxiety.  
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:32:18
??? 17k-6k-11k -6.4k-9.9k Bored you?
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:04:41
you can use crypto on like any online sport betting site dude
@_date: 2018-05-08 01:10:30




Don't expect anyone to understand that from what you wrote.
@_date: 2018-05-07 15:02:01
Um yeah I'm having trouble understanding where the 10k came from.  What your OP means to anyone that understands English is "I haven't bought since I made my first purchase in December.  I purchased $100 worth ofnbitcoin."


@_date: 2018-08-03 14:52:42
no it's  10% away and there is 0 support at 5200 have you looked at the chart? We're gonna have 6800, 6300, 5800 then likely high 4000's
@_date: 2018-05-07 14:53:34
So your first post is a weird lie? huh, that's neat.
@_date: 2017-12-17 23:19:59
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:58:20
I believe you have to deposit $ into your actual gdax account

Arizona and Georgia.  Bills haven't passed yet but are on the way.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:58:27
the market dropped 1 random day in february and has since recovered what the hell does that have to do with googles decision to ban crypto ads lmfao 
@_date: 2018-03-19 02:49:15

@_date: 2018-03-09 04:54:05
well everyone gets 3 day trades per week but yeah, you're basically right
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:47:13

@_date: 2018-03-09 04:56:46
well they dumped 35k bitcoin into the market.  albeit it was over 3 months but that's still a decent amount of supply to add.
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:45:26
Your post is just nonsense my man. Source on your first claim?, not that I think that'd even be possible. 
When did the stock market "plunge"? 
Why would google ban crypto ads because their stock price is up 1% this month?, again what plunge?
What the heck does you last few sentences even mean?
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:21:26
yeah that vol spike was dank.  The etf self-terminates by design once it hits -80% 
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:34:25
until it doesnt
@_date: 2018-02-19 19:58:32
you need to inverse yourself
@_date: 2018-03-15 03:33:29
sell now?  I'm trying to move funds around to buy more
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:18:28
@_date: 2018-02-24 22:10:05
Some people just like to be trolls I guess. idk man why don't we go outside and ride our bikes about it
@_date: 2018-03-27 02:34:37
Most people manually set their fees I'd imagine
@_date: 2018-02-25 21:13:58
make a gdax account. transfer from coinbase- gdax (instant+free) then gdax to anywhere you want for free
@_date: 2018-02-25 18:55:05

Streamers are usually either 
1. Very, very good at the game.  Do you enjoy watching the top professional athletes play sports on tv? very similar except you can interact with them
2. Provide comedy! You're watching people play a game but they are also talking to chat and other friends they are playing with.  Most streamers are entertaining people.
3. Have huge tits.
