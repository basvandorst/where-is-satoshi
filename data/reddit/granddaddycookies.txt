I can´t get the ID, when I click on the link in my wallet it sends me to blockchain and says "Transaction not found" this is the wallet I am trying to send the bitcoins to 1FtP7DDQVuyj89vhxgM1yBMKYVVC1bFjdZ

They only reply monday-friday, but bitcoins were just returned to my wallet and in the transaction history the deposit I tried to make wasn´t there

I know it is new, but in my other account I really wanted to go anonymous so I used some password I never use, then I forgot it

The transaction was canceled minutes after posting, coins were returned to my wallet, the company that was providing services to my wallet was down for some time, so no ones transaction was made like in a 6 hour window in the wallet I used

The wallet I used to withdraw the bitcoins is called volabit, and at their fees page it says there is no fee in deposits and withdraws made in BTC, only when withdrawing the bitcoins and its 0.0001 and goes to the miners, I think the last one talks about changing BTC to mexican pesos since this wallet service is used to buy bitcoins; but I´ve already used this service twice, the first time it was 20 usd worth of bitcoins and the second one around 6 usd
