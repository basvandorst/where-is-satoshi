v0.1.0 in semantic versioning is like a first alpha release.

I already get $0 fees a month from my bank as I do everything electronically with them and don't get paper statements. Why would I voluntarily pay a couple of dollars per month ($24/year) for this new LN method?

It's a shame that it costs at least 240~ Satoshi to send a transaction though.

Step 1: Join BlockStream as an employee or contractor.
Step 2: git clone...

Mining chips are optimised to do sha256d which is sha256(sha256(nonce)) trillions of times very quickly. They can't do a single sha256. The signature verifications and other things which need sha256 are done in the node software which is general purpose running on a regular server and separate from the mining rigs.

Really nice site and very well done. Quite interesting to learn this way.

This will be an unpopular opinion but I don't see it reaching 20K again for a long while. There are other alt coins now with better features (smart contracts, private transactions) and that resolve other issues like having low fees and scalability solutions ready to go (not in alpha/beta etc). Bitcoin squandered its first-mover advantage. I think it will be toppled this year or next. Eventually the price might go back up to 20K just due to its limited supply but some other coin with less issues will be worth 50K by then.

5500 USD would trigger some extra money laundering type flags with authorities and banks. Not surprised it's missing. You're better off sticking to under $5K.

Housing is also a reasonable store of value if mortgage free. Also you can live in it which provides good security in itself. You can also always sell it and buy somewhere cheaper and pocket the cash to buy other things. Don't tell them to sell their house. Just tell them to buy $100-$200 in crypto every month.

Why do they call it "Bitcoin Core" though. Perhaps there is some history here that is missing. Their claim is that Bitcoin development is centralised to one repository, the Bitcoin Core repository and their approved developers. If there's any truth to that decide for yourself.

All that shows is that a lot of people stopped using Bitcoin all of a sudden. Probably gone to use altcoins.

I guess if you shouldn't use it for buying/selling it's like a stock that can only be traded back to fiat. However the stock you're now buying has no backing in reality (no company behind it or precious resource/metal backing it) so it's essentially worthless, it's only value is speculation. You may as well just trade basketball cards. Bitcoin was originally designed as a P2P digital currency, which is where it derives its value. Take that away and there is no value.
TL:DR; OP is a moron.

Nobody owns "Bitcoin" as a trademark, hence there's no infringement and hence lots of other coins using the name well before BCH appeared e.g. Bitcoin Dark.

You're a brave man.

This is pretty stupid.
1) The _Block Explorer_ page where it mentions Bitcoin (BCH) is not the same as the _Buy Bitcoin_ page where they are clearly differentiated as Bitcoin Core (BTC) and Bitcoin Cash (BCH). You're going to have a very hard time proving you bought the wrong coin without also proving yourself to be a complete failure at doing your own research to figure out what you're buying.
2) I tested the Bitcoin.com wallet myself and it creates a BCH and BTC wallet. The BTC wallet is hidden by default but you can choose to show it in the settings.

If you travel in any country you would be wise to check for skimming devices and also cameras which capture you entering your PIN. Also use cards that have a chip in them which are harder to forge than the purely magnetic ones.
