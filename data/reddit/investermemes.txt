super noob question here, but I thought you use a hardware wallet, and a paper wallet recovers your wallet if something happens to the hardware, is this incorrect? and sorry another noob question, but can you keep different currencies on one wallet or do you need a different wallet for each currency.

how do you get your coins during a fork? im assuming this is a pretty complex question, i may have to read up on it myself, but i assume that cant be in the same wallet as the bitcoin itself

I guess because I feel the chance of me losing it or having some sort of technical error, like the dog eating the flash drive or spilling water, or even keeping it in a safety deposit box all of those things are not insured, whereas coinbase actually is insured.

so like they just took everyone's money and ran? was this a us based company?I mean I can google it myself and I will in a minute but I feel that bitcoin is starting to become safer the larger it grows.
