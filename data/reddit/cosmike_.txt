It might be a problem with your bank not with coinbase. Contact your bank.

Literally no one knows.

Kids and their imaginations.

Are we supposed to be impressed?  
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:25:50
What is happening? 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:01:49
People buy, price goes up. People sell, price goes down. So what caused the dip? Lots of people selling. Why did they sell? That’s anyone’s guess. Sometimes it’s tied to some bad news that comes out, or the exchanges clogging up so people can’t log in and then panic selling begins. Or high rollers manipulate the market. All of the above plus the unlimited potential of the human psyche. Does that help? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 05:42:17
They made a few thousand bucks in a couple weeks? Sounds like they’re doing just fine and you might be feeling a bit bitter. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:29:57
I understand, I only meant in terms of value. Fiat currency has value because we, and our governments, say it does. Crypto is the same way, in that it’s valued by shared consensus, it just isn’t regulated. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:39:32
You must be new here. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:16:13
Crypto currency IS speculation. The only reason it has value is because people buy it, and agree that it does. Just like any other currency. They’re not all of a sudden going to come to this grand realization that they’ve invested lots of money in nothing. They know. We all know. And if you don’t know then you probably don’t have the funds to buy enough bitcoin to effect any sort of change anyway. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:09:31
I’m not sure you “foresaw” as much as saw the dip that already happened lol. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:35:36
That’s very unlikely. This isn’t a stock, and it isn’t a very great currency either. It’s something new so traditional forms of thinking won’t apply. Adapt. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:30:59
Are you Australian? That analogy seems like something that makes no sense to anyone but an Australian, and I love it. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:40:21
Magic 8 ball says go for it. But it may drop more. Or it may go up. Or it may stay the same. It’s all a guessing game my friend. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:10:08
No. Just know that this is uncharted territory and no one really knows what will happen. It could plummet tomorrow, or never. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:48:54
Then don’t buy it. No one is forcing you to. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:30:33
Nothing about crypto currency is normal. You need to think outside of “normal” market parameters. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:56:36
No. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 20:03:22
That’s absolutely true. Just like you could mow the lawn for $100 bucks for your neighbor and not report profits. You’re supposed to, and it’s the law, but that doesn’t mean you’ll go to jail if you don’t, because you’ll probably never get caught. Most people aren’t jumping through hoops to avoid taxes though, they’re just trying to buy some coins and make a profit at this point, in which case they should be aware that they need to pay taxes on those. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:32:07
So you’re going to spend a extra $400 dollars? Why not return and just get a laptop that has a better graphics card...

Pretty sure you aren’t aware of how a Ponzi scheme works. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:25:13
I do, everyday. Again, what expertise or information are you using to come to this conclusion? You seem more like a butthurt dude who missed out and is angry that everyone else is making money. Who are you to offer speculation worth listening to? 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:05:39
But that doesn’t mean it’s a valuable currency. I understand the value of the technology, or the intellectual property, but that doesn’t translate to a currency. It’s valued as a currency because we all agree it makes a good currency, not because  of the value of the technology. By your standards it’s a stock, which it isn’t. We want a digital currency, so we accept it as forms of payment for things, because someone else will also accept it as payment for things. Inherent value is different than implied value, and this has both, which makes it something entirely new and not just a stock or a currency. A dollar doesn’t have any other use except for being a dollar, its value as a dollar doesn’t come from the underlying protocol, it comes from all of us, and the government, agreeing that it’s a usable form of currency that has value. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:32:27
Here be dragons. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:52:34
The devil. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:07:18
I would probably look at the floors of the last few dips and average out a price from that, then add a few hundred dollars. We’re sort of in uncharted territory here, it looks like it might breach 15k tonight so honestly it’s anyone’s guess what will happen next. It might never go below 10k again, or it might crash. Who knows. I would honestly just hang on and hold through all of the dips and crashes unless you severely need those funds for something critical in your life. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:51:07
The price for convenience and user friendliness is unfortunately inaccuracy. If you’re trying to time ATHs and dips definitely set your limit orders on gdax, but it seems like you know that. I wouldn’t be trying to time the market with coinbase. But again, all of that is explained on the website. They definitely won’t give you a refund. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:42:52
The price displayed on coinbase is not the price you will get for a specific sell. When you actually place the order it will show you the real price you’re selling/buying at, plus fee. It’s wise to know how things work before investing large sums of money into them. All of this is explained on the coinbase website. Thanks for playing! 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:58:47
So you’re planning on passing them on to your children or what? If you never sell them how can you reap the benefits of holding? 
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:21:53
Sounds like the only thing informing this opinion is that you no longer have any, so you don’t want it to go up. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:26:31
Talking dollar amounts. There are limits to how much you can buy and sell in dollars on the exchanges. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:50:08
And that is way too much for that laptop. I bought an Asus ROG over Black Friday with all the same specs but a GTX1060 instead for $350 less...
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:40:16
Why wouldn’t they pay taxes? Any profits made through buying/selling crypto currencies is considered capital gains, and is taxable. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:09:32
And you’re basing this on what?
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:31:52
You can’t kick yourself for not being able to predict the future. You made a decision that’s allowed you and your family to live a comfortable life, honestly, you made a mature decision. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:03:57
I think it doubles, and then you have to wait 2 months for it to increase further. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 13:42:44
There was a man, born inside of the bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:47:14
How could anyone? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:10:01
Sounds pretty fishy, I’d imagine your “friend” is lying to you and has neither bitcoin nor a rich family, other than his mother who periodically wanders into the basement to change his bedpan and feed him cheesy poofs. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 19:36:30
This is all explained on Coinbase’ website, and has been asked ad nauseam on this subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:41:42
How so?
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:42:48
Is 10k all of the money you “ran into”? I would weigh this decision based off of how much you make per year, how much debt you have that could be paid off, etc. If this is your first time investing I definitely wouldn’t A) put $10,000 into something you know nothing about and B) Put $10,000 into something you know nothing about on the advice of Reddit users. Budget first, figure out what realistically makes sense to put in (not $10,000), and then spend a month researching the technology. If you’re in it for the long run, which you should be given how you’re having to ask Reddit for help and therefore shouldn’t consider day trading, then whether you invest now or in a month it won’t really matter when projected over 5-10 years. The best strategy in my opinion is to invest steadily, every few weeks, and take advantage every once in a while of dips. If you can pay off a car/credit card with that money that is going to improve your life much more than investing in bitcoin. Just my .02 BTC. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:38:38
I’ve only been in this for a few months and I can tell you this is not unusual. You’ll get used to it. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:10:39
Jealous! I long to be a part of the whole numbers club. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:01:33
How is it ever going to grow if no one invests after a certain point...
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:48:00
It just seems like you want people to be impressed but like, people are buying Lambos and houses with their profits on this subreddit. Not really sure why you felt it necessary to post links to a budget laptop and a budget tv...
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:49:34
Why wouldn’t you just invest now? If you’re in it for the long haul, $500 difference is inconsequential. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:38:20
How is this relevant?
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:57:21
Up for me. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:06:07
�� 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:07:43
Yes, because as we saw last week, you can’t rely on the exchanges being up and running when they get overloaded, which tends to happen with the dips. A limit order will kick in automatically when your price hits. Of course, you’re risking never hitting your limit order, or setting it above what the bottom of the real dip is. There are no guarantees in this crypto business, but it’s definitely a way to make sure you can at least take advantage of a dip somewhat. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:24:19
I’m not putting you down for getting what you want, I’m just saying like, what’s the point in linking to the actual computer and tv? Why not just say hey I was able to buy a computer and a tv with my profits? Again, comes off like you’re trying to impress, which is more the thing that’s annoying than what you actually got. Everyone has different goals for their money, but showing off regardless is lame. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:08:40
I mean, “bulk” varies from person to person. What are we talking here?
@_date: 2017-12-27 20:14:08
Yeah, you’d have 100 in a climate controlled garage bigger than a Macys department store staffed by gorgeous Armenian women in skimpy outfits who say things like “yes sir” and “anything you need sir”. Sounds awful. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:45:24
Yeah. Caution is definitely the key word, and should be applied by all. Lots of people trying to get rich quick which is extraordinarily unlikely. I’m fine as long as I make ANY money, as I get enjoyment following along and being a part of the community as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 12:27:22
Everyone says simultaneously that it’s going to crash and that it’s flying to the moon. No one knows what they’re talking about. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:12:01
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:13:38
We’ve never seen cryptos before, we don’t know what is going to happen. They aren’t stocks. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:44:17
That’s highly unlikely. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:14:13
This is the game. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:05:04
I just tell myself that future me can’t afford present me to not put in more than I can afford. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:20:42
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:34:57
I’ve been buying in since 7k and bought some at 11.5k afraid of a huge rush. I know this is a marathon and not a sprint but still disappointing seeing all that red. Seems like this was solely the fault of the exchanges not being able to handle the traffic, which is disappointing. How are people going to be confident in buying if the exchanges crash so easily? 
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:24:03
If thanksgiving was a huge boon to bitcoin due to families talking about it around the dinner table, how do you figure one of the highest watched shows talking about it to tens of millions of people won’t have the same effect?

You can’t make a profit if you never buy...

But he didn’t even buy, it was gifted to him. He’s making 100% profit no matter what. Why not hold out?
