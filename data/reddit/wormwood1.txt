I dont need to know the "scammers and spammers", I just need to know who I want to get through...everyone else has to pay.

If you could get this phone system to work. Your phone would earn itself. You could always maintain the newest phone you desired.

It should probably bounce back an email with a Message " Your message was rejected..." followed with a link to buy access to the message you sent. 
You could offer to complete the email for a  fee.
Or 
The mailer can buy access, like a subscription.

"you cannot force anyone to pay for access to you."
I control access to me.
I pay for the phone.
I pay for the internet.
I control that valve, turning it off and on, and people are already paying for access. Telemarketers buy phone lists, for example.
You are right I cannot force them to pay, but I can charge them for access. BUT they cannot force me to pay for their access to me either.

What do you mean "go mainstream"? Big gov approved? Big business sanctioned? Perhaps something big banking would like.
Bitcoin was not intended for them and if you make Bitcoin electric government fiat I will go to an alt coin.

Perhaps 
Telemarketers spend money on lots of people that never buy. Telemarketing works because the few sales they do make cover the cost of making those connections. If you don't charge enough to make it unprofitable to them, it may still be profitable to you.
Nevertheless, if they don't call because I charge, I would be happy with that.

If Redbox integrated Bitcoin, you would have seamless integration throughout that system, and consequently opportunity for Bitcoin transactions in every community that has Redbox. Sounds like a win win situation.

 does that mean if I held it at another restaurant nearby you would come? If so, join the MeetUp and tell me where you would rather meet. Perhaps Cracker Barrel in Gaffney?

Until they get High Speed internet in my neighborhood I will be using physical media.

Someone needs to do a press release about this event, and where possible list restaurants taking Bitcoin.
