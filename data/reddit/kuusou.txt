If they started stopping these people, or at the very least group leaders, from spending money and whatnot, it might become one.

A new form of mining even? Mining through and decrypting all of the lost codes.
@_date: 2012-12-03 15:34:11
Your spreadsheet is using a reasonable power usage right? Underclocking everything and getting the card to its peak hashrate right? And yes, keeping the cards at the best temp possible does help your hashrate so that does matter, but that can vary a lot from person to person.
Because as far as I can tell, most of the main cards still work just fine for people with 11c/kwh at current rates.
You also cant take into account the cost of hardware, like I said. No one should be buying new hardware right now. It wont pay itself off. But if you already own the cards, why not mine with them? As long as you at least break even, it's worth it.
Many people that are mining already have fixed power bills or they don't pay them or they are actually lower than 11c. So there is that to take into account as well.
And no, I didn't mean that ASICs are the sole reason that GPUs will become unprofitable, but it will be the only thing to kill GPU mining before the next halving. The only people that are going to be turning off their GPU miners are the ones that were small game. No one that put a lot of effort and money into mining is currently losing out because of the block halving. They always made more than double their energy costs.

Well I guess those would have to be on the list as well as they are used in the same exact manner. But I was more specifically talking about precious metals and gems. And we could continue this into even more forms because we place value on many "base" items, such as ingredients in food. Tobacco would be another big one. There are things that we wouldn't consider a currency that are exchanged around the world that are far more widespread and accepted than Bitcoin...
"circulation as a medium of exchange." covers a lot of things that we have and use. 
I just think its fairly obvious that the list is not of "circulation as a mediums of exchange." but of accepted money. It's very obviously a list of ISO 4217 recognized currencies. Not just things we use as currencies.

Halving the amount you get per block doesn't do much for most people. Most people were making more than double their electric costs.
The issue is going to be ASICs. I think a lot of people confuse the halving with the release of ASIC miners. The ASICs are the GPU killers, not the block halving. 
Also I think a lot of people who think GPUs were going to just stop, were and are taking into account buying GPUs. It's wholly unreasonable to buy a GPU in order to mine. It will take years to make up the cost at current rates. And we all know it's just going to get harder. So it's reasonable to assume that you would never pay a GPU off, especially a new one.
This doesn't even take into account someone who might mine with a GPU they plan to use later, meaning they also don't need to take their GPU cost into account unless they plan on letting it break. And also people who think that they will sell their GPUs as soon as it actually does cost more to let the card run then it does to just buy the coins, mitigating a lot of the cards cost.
But people who already own their GPUs are not going to just turn them off. They are going to let them run as long as possibly, making as much as they can. As long as they make even a little bit more than the cost of electricity, it's profitable now.
And then you run into the idea of future value. So people that break even or even mine at a loss are using one of the easiest methods of "buying" Bitcoins that we have. At least, without buying them at quite a loss. And down the road, the Bitcoins that they mined, will always just go up in value.
And none of this really touches on the fact that there are a lot of people that are trying to get out of mining, but taking most of this stuff into account, they will let those cards run forever until they find a buyer with the right price. 
No matter how you want to look at it, halving the income was never going to shut down mining overnight. Even ASICs are going to take a bit of time before they fully push GPUs out.

The large sums don't bother me. I think it's nuts how many people start up and then stop. All of those small piles laying around. It would be pretty awesome if there was a way to get them..
@_date: 2012-11-15 13:05:21
Well there is not an inflation going on with bitcoins. It's a natural progression and it has a limit. People mining are doing work for the Bitcoin users (in more ways than one.) and getting rewarded for doing so. That's not the same as printing money.
@_date: 2012-12-13 11:29:48
By your definition though we would have to add a hell of a lot of things to that list.
It's obviously a list of registered currencies and not just things that we trade and value. It's not a list of "mediums of exchange." 
I have embraced it as much as I can, and I love it, but I just don't think people have the right idea about it sometimes. Becoming a publicly accepted currency is going to take a bit more doing, and I personally don't believe it's going to be as awesome as so many people think. I think it's going to cause a lot of issues.

They have talked a lot about needing more ads on the site because of all of the traffic. Reddit gold is the counter to that. They have stated this outright.
So you are donating because this service is completely free and it costs a shit load of money to maintain. You donate so that they don't have to resort to using more ads on the site. And when you donate you are rewarded with features that they have said are sort of "in beta" and might later be released to the public.

Well that is just silly. It's not trying to be Bitcoin. It's not 3 years too late. Bitcoin is Bitcoin. But why would we want just 1 of these cryptocurrencies? So far Litecoin looks to be the best alternative.
I think it's a good thing. 
@_date: 2012-12-02 00:27:58
I personally think the best way to obtain Bitcoin from money, is to buy things people want and sell them for Bitcoin.
There are even services like Bitmit that allow you do it do it Ebay style. Though that site is not as large as I would like it to be.
You do have to take the time, and put the effort into protecting yourself though.

I'm pretty sure Bitcoin is not actually a currency though. So there is that.
People talk a lot about it getting currency status but I don't know if that is even a good idea. It sounds to me like a call for governments to get involved. And I don't know how far we would get before people start seeing a lot of issues surrounding it. 
Putting Bitcoin on that list is no different than putting some form of game currency on there or gold or diamonds or some other form that we trade. It's not a currency just because we value it.

I know things are in the works, I didn't say it was a silly thing to want or that it wouldn't happen, I'm just commenting on the current state of Bitcoin, and my predictions for it down the road if it receives the status that so many want.
I also still believe it will take a lot more for it to become widely used and accepts. It's looking good so far though.. Lets just hope nothing gos horribly wrong.

I'm over on deepbit. As long as you are using one of the more well known pools (and choose to keep doing so) there is really no reason to pick one over the other based on anything but preference. Some have fees, some don't, some offer a bit more, some a bit less. 
I just think deepbit has a good site. Most of the other site are either really clunky or don't have enough features. I would be willing to change if I ever felt like another service was offering me a better deal/community/site.
As for switching to a smaller pool it's almost the same thing except you need to take into account that most will take longer to get your payouts (slower speed and all). Either way you are going to be getting about the same in bitcoins though. Some of the smaller pools also offer competitions and have a more social setting. It's a toss up between consistent pay and up-time and that social aspect in most cases.
@_date: 2012-11-11 23:41:18
Well something that could crack these codes in general would be just amazing. It really is kind of unrealistic right now and it would be able to do it to anyone. So it would be stealing. It could grab anyones code and crack it open and take the coins, easy as that and we all use codes like that so no one would be safe.
If this was done, as you said before, it would be in a time where we were already using far better encryption than we are now and cracking the stuff we use now was fairly simple. We would be using a program to find the old codes, ones that no one would ever use anymore, and taking those coins.
It would just be doing clean up unused codes of a time long passed. I'm sure it's the kind of thing that would be done behind scenes for a while before it got out. But then again, it would be a lot like mining now. I would be far faster and easier to do in a pool. 
But yes, we are pretty much talking about creating a botnet that hunts down and cracks bitcoin wallets. It's not the kind of thing we want around any time soon.
@_date: 2013-08-30 06:44:17
I had no idea that they were selling for so much. I honestly feel like I should sell it at this point. I'm almost stupid not to. I too feel as though I would be giving something up though.
But honestly. Couldn't we just buy some freaking USB miners or something and feel the same way? But have more money?
I might put mine on sale soon.

It's exactly like saying I wouldn't randomly send dollar bills over the internet, because I have absolutely no way of getting them back.
It's not a "Non sequitur" it's just exactly what I'm saying. It doesn't make sense to spend amazing amount of money on things from people that you don't know and cannot trust, because they might not be real.
It sounds to me like you're just regurgitating things you have heard people say on this subreddit multiple times. Just because it can be compared to cash doesn't mean that you should try and compare it to such in every single situation as if that's some kind of catch all. And don't say "non sequitur." like it's the coup de grace....
As I said, it's exactly what I'm saying. I don't plan on randomly sending cash over the internet to people I don't know any time soon. It's a really good way to get scammed.

@_date: 2013-07-23 06:22:34
Ha, everyone time someone says this I have to remind them that the same exact thing happened when people switched to using GPUs.
Could you afford to make a GPU farm? Did you? For that cost or less you could still be making plenty of coins right now with asics. No change in cost, just in hardware.
It's actually fairly stupid for you or anyone to act like the average person not being able to farm bitcoins would harm it in any way. You can still buy them and use them and sell them all the same.
I mean, do you think most people are making money on farming bitcoins? There is SO MUCH MORE than that going on here.
The "wealthy people." have always had the upper hand. Nothing what so ever is changing, just shifting over to new tech.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:29:49
I don't believe that what so ever. People still think they are making money because the USD they spend is less than they will get the from the BTC later. And without taking into account that you could have just gotten some BTC with your money in the first place and come out even farther on the other end, that's pretty true... but in reality because the other option is so obvious, you are losing money.
At certain points in time, like lets say, back when BFL started taking orders, it might have made sense to think in terms of USD only, because buying BTC has not always been as easy and safe as it is today. There was way too much risk in dealing with a stranger and random sites, and dealing with a company and your credit card was much safer because no matter what the company said, you could at least get a chargeback on your card...
But now it's quite trivial to buy some coins, so it doesn't make as much sense.
Buying a USB miner or two could be fun though, so I get the draw, just don't act like you didn't have a clear alternative that would have made you more money in the end...
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:33:55
His advice was absolutely awful. I'm not going to start telling you how to do anything specific, only because you seem to be really new to all of this, so I'm just going to direct you to the sidebar of this subreddit. 
There is a getting started section along with all kinds of simple information that new people might have, including (if you follow links and actually read.) how to buy and sell Bitcoins properly.
More than anything though I would just say not to jump into anything and don't be too trusting of anyone or anything. Stick to common paths and sites and keep an eye out for new information at all times.
It's not nearly as "hard." as it seems, but it's not exactly plug and play at this point either.

No, all that matters is what Avalon makes, not what Bitcoin is worth. It's only about the interest in Bitcoin and peoples willingness to buy things from Avalon.

I have a dual boot right now running mint as well as windows 7. I even have Steam on mint so that I can play a whole bunch of games over there without even having to switch over. I figured I would switch over when there was a real reason to.
I use Windows 7 full time. I actually want to uninstall mint because it makes reboots annoying (it's the default option so I have to switch off of it during boot.)
For a long time I was waiting for Steam on Linux and now I have that and a lot of games. But simple things like Netflix are still not viable and it's really annoying to deal with.

And I got a cool toy out of it, and if anything went wrong I had a real company I could go after for my money. I will see a nice return on the product, and there was far less risk. It's now far easier than it was to get coins, far more outlets that are trusted. And I don't remember it being 11 dollars, at least, not anywhere I could get coins reasonably. More like 20.
I think the big issue is that people are all hopped up on this bet issues. As if, I was making a bet and trying to get rich. There are idiots out there who look at Bitcoin as some sort of get rich quick scheme, and I partially feel bad for them, but not by much. Only an idiot buys into random companies online for a tonne of money and believes they are going to sit back and watch money accumulate in their bank. 
There's a reason I spent 170, I knew I would make my money back easily, even if it took them a year to get it to me. All of these companies are shitty in my eyes, and I don't plan on giving anyone any more money, but I have no qualms over my purchase. At the time, it was the easiest way for me to ensure that, no matter what the increase in cost of bitcoins was, I was going to get some, and if I felt cheated, I could get my money back (at the time.)
And if I had made a bet (not my thought process at the time), I probably would have gone the same way. There was no way of knowing BTC would have a bubble because of the media and settle at or above 100 per coin or that the increase in difficulty would be what it is. I remember people quoting 20m as if it was a lot and would be crazy to see once asics came out. I would rather bet and come out on the other end with 7 coins (within the period that chart shows, and although the drop is fairly steep, it can still produce longer than that.) than place my trust in an 11 dollar (Once again though, I'm fairly certain it was more like double that at the time, at least from places I was actually able to get coins, meaning I will end up closer to even than anything else.) BTC to rise enough to make up for my cost. All done well before everyone hindsight started kicking in.
It's fun, it's a toy. But it's also going to make me money.
Also it's mining at more than 5GH. It's actually closer to 6, and that's without any extra care taken to cool it or get better speeds out of it. I also don't pay electricity on the 30 watts taken up, so that's another increase. I also don't pay those fees. My calculation puts me at 7 coins made. So we are talking about a ~1 coin loss here. People are paying one coin for far less these days. And like I said, I got it for fun. I say the risk was worth it (especially if you take into consideration when I got it, and not look at it from todays perspective.), and I think I'm coming out reasonably even on the whole thing. You can continue to quote unknown variable and tell people they made the wrong move, but it's meaningless.
No one here is special for being able to look at the numbers today and look back 8 months and tell people they were wrong. None of this was calculable back then. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:34:57
That's going to happen anyways. I can't stand that people are using this as some sort of "SEE THERE IS A REASON!" as if that means we should all blow money on companies that are selling novelty items as if they are actually worth the money they cost....
The network will grow as new, better, more reasonable technology comes out. I put money on it that we will continue to see new generations of miners that turn a profit.... but the tiny little USB miners are not going to do jack for the network as a whole. It's unreasonable.

No, you are misunderstanding. It's still decentralized, as I said, everyone can still participate. The issue is that, from the very beginning, the use of technology in general, creates a situation where it's a game where people can be big or small. It's really that simple.
The issue though is that people feel as though because they are not making a bunch of money every day, they are not participating or doing anything, and that's just not true.

You don't make less than 2 dollars an hour if you live in the US. Your company HAS TO PAY YOU MINIMUM WAGE, there is no way around it. If you didn't make up the rest in tips, they have to cover you up to minimum, no way around it. You don't need tips to survive, that's just outrageous. We have a minimum wage for a reason.
And also don't act as though you don't make plenty of money from tips, more than minimum wage (because if you didn't, you would be paid minimum wage by the company...) working a job that gets tips. I don't know a single person who doesn't love their tips, because they make the job much better than it should be.
I don't care if people give out bitcoins as tips, I personally think it's a complete waste of perfectly good bitcoins, but honestly, I don't care. I care far more about people like you who are brainwashed into thinking you can actually get paid less than minimum wage if people don't throw money at you on every single order.

When you buy Bitcoin you are.....
Buying into it becoming widely accepted later on.
What this means for most people is that it's a long term investment. Over time it should do nothing but go up. If you ignore all of the little bubbles, this should be true.
Everything you are commenting on right now is only true if you look at the few bubbles that Bitcoin has had, and that's it. And those can be attributed to interest in them, and nothing more. Once Bitcoin becomes far more widely accepted these things should not happen.
Early adopters will be (if everything works out) the ones to make money in the end, but the end goal isn't really investment, it's the adoption of a whole new currency.

God damn it. I just finally started trading and stuff (I sat on my coins for quite some time.) and it just so happened to coincide with all of this shit. For me the little boom was nice, as trading before would have been less fun, but I really could care less about it...
And now all of this shit...
And I knew better than to get into Gox, they get DDoSed every minute and they just hold too much market share, I wanted to take my stuff elsewhere...
And Bitfloor looked so damn nice...
It's a good thing I had almost everything in coins too, that's simple to move into my wallet... but I have fucking 67 CENTS sitting in there. I can't trade it over into BTC like I was going to, and it just feels worthless to get all of my information in there to take it out.. but it's my money......
God.. so shitty. I really really liked that site.. I hope that maybe this isn't permanent.
And now I'm just bored. I mean, what service do I use now? Most seem shady at best and the giant Gox feels wrong...

I find that incredibly funny. I have already made over 10 dollars in the first day. I will have my money back in 20 days or less.
It's like some sort of sour grapes situation here, no one cares about the facts or the actual logistics of the situation, all they care about is that someone else, what they have, that must not be awesome, because I don't have it.
Come on, really, have you looked into ROI what so ever for these?
Edit: I wanted to make something more clear. I said 10 dollars, but in reality what I have made is .1 Bitcoins. The more Bitcoin goes up in price, the more I will have already made. ROI is not even remotely an issue here. It will be in a couple months, maybe, if prices don't rise. But I see prices going up plenty.

I think the one "flaw." in terms of BTC for me is that I will just never use them with a company online. Not one that I can't easily hold accountable that's for sure.
The main reason that I got a Jalapeno back when those first started taking orders was because at any time I could walk into my bank and tell them to get my money back. It was that simple. And BTC was not nearly as simple to purchase back then, it didn't even remotely feel safe that's for sure. This last bubble did a lot of good for security I think. Lots of new and better sites.
I feel sort of bad for people paying into BFL. But not really. Especially ones not taking precautions.

I didn't make a bet though. I think that's the big issue here. I might not get that many bitcoins out of it, or maybe I will invest what I make properly and see much more of a return. I had money that was not even remotely easily capable of being put into bitcoin. BFL on the other hand, made it very simple. 
There is a reason I didn't spend 30 fucking grand or whatever on the device. I got a 170 toy that will pay itself off within 30 days and then randomly make me money. I wasn't betting on anything other than having fun with bitcoin. And in the end, I will come out ahead no matter what. With way less risk on my end as BFL is a company I can go after for my money back should anything happen.
I also am fairly certain it wasn't 11 per coin when I got this, but once again, this is an issue of being able to actually get my hands on coins that were 11 per coin and not get ripped off.
Since Nov there have been tonnes in improvements in the way of buying coins.

It's pretty sad that "hacker." is now some sort of slur word.
Hackers created the computer, the internet, your operating system.. all of it...
It WAS hackers that created bitcoin and it's hackers who maintain our programs, and I wish we could say that proudly. 
That being said, I'm willing to use different words when needed. Other people should be as well. Correct people when needed without being rude. Let people know the truth without sounding like you feel ahead of the game or special.

What if one single person does, randomly, for some reason?
And what else are people going to put in their signature? 
It's just one of your many public keys and if you only use it for random donations (I use mine for anything considered "free." bitcoins.) and don't link it with your other addressed than your fine.
I personally think it looks better when someone has an address in their signature.
@_date: 2013-08-13 05:55:48
You will.
I'm in almost the same boat, I'm a bit ahead of you. We are perfectly fine. 
You need to keep in mind the price of bitcoin will go up too.

They have a no refund policy in place, you can't get mad at them because you gave them money and accepted this. Older orders probably still have a chance to be refunded, as people have, but newer orders are not going to be awarded this benefit. 
Please stop the circle jerk that is getting on BFL. We get it, but don't just make up new issues when it's actually not their fault what so ever.
@_date: 2013-09-20 17:39:40
I agree. I "believe." in Bitcoin if you will. I like it, I want to use it, I can't wait for it to get easier and easier to use. But it's still kind of.... unsafe in many ways. You still have to be super aware of everything and I just don't like that.
But I can wait. 
@_date: 2013-06-02 04:02:10
I agree, and have an upvote.
What I wonder though, is are the donations enough for them. Maybe the whole draw is the donations. Someone donates 100 bucks, that's 2+ peoples worth of pay for a whole year.... and so on..

Or if he was specifically saving those coins and not spending them and believed they would increase in price over time.

I'm cool with that. I want one. But 50 dollars or more? You can suck it for that price.
I would love to buy something like this, for me, for some friends maybe. But not only will they be disappointed, but It will have cost me a bunch of money for no reason.
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:49:13
Ew are you serious? What about my comment would make me even "pro BFL." let alone a sock puppet for the company.
The issue here is that people just LOVE to circle jerk over this shit. It's REALLY simple, if you give them money for a product, that's it, you don't get your money back, you agree to that when you go through the process. They are not being sly, they are not lying to you, there is no trickery and it's not their fault at that point, it's yours.
If you don't like their policies or their company than you don't but from them, there is nothing else to it.
I'm not a sock puppet account, I'm just not part of your little circle jerk and I'm not an idiot who just throws my money into things without knowing what I'm getting into.
@_date: 2013-06-26 10:27:48
But that's just too bad. You don't buy from them than. You don't go ahead and pay into the company and then start complaining on forums when they don't adhere to things you want, when you clearly agreed to not being able to do them.
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:25:17
That doesn't even make sense.
The issue is should you buy the BTC outright right now or buy the mining machine.
If it costs 100 dollars for a miner, and 100 dollars for a Bitcoin, but the miner will only ever make you .9 Bitcoins, then you don't buy the miner believing you will come out ahead just because Bitcoins are worth 1000 dollars next year.
Your investment lost you 100 dollars in that case because there was a clear alternative to what you did.
You don't think of it in terms of "no matter what I make more USD." when you are in fact making less than you would have if you had done the obvious alternative.
@_date: 2013-04-19 09:10:38
The only thing I ever regret is being a child when all of this stated.
I knew what it was, what it could be, what I wanted it to be... but like every single thing in my life that I "know." will make me money or turn out to be awesome, I don't have the money for it.
So back when this all started I tried to mine on my CPU but it didn't really do much because I didn't have any power really. Now sure, I got some coins or whatever here and there... but I always remember thinking that a few coins didn't mean anything at all and I should just stop. Thinking back, that was really stupid of me. But even now looking back I can only think about how much I wish I could have just thrown a few hundred into BTC when they were a few cents each.
Sadly I lost those addresses and wallets, though I fully believe that if I had put real money into them that I would have done a better job of things. I was young, I just lost interest in it all, I figured I would get back into it later, maybe when I had the money for a real "Rig." or something.
And more recently, right before the whole BFL and ASICs started showing up, I was mining with my card (30 MH/s) and I got a friend to loan me a spare card he was not using (80 MH/s) but it was all for fun, I just wanted to play around with the programs and stuff. I turned off the main card because I couldn't actually use my computer with it mining and I let the other one run. It mined 0.55 BTC for me. And after I paid for my Jalapeno from BFL I figured hey.. I'll stop mining, because it feels like a hassle, and I will just wait for my shipment (I also thought my friend was going to take back his card, something he has still not gotten around to doing). Thinking back that was fucking stupid. I would have had a few coins from mining by now with just this 80 MH/s card, that translates to 100s of dollars... and BFL STILL hasn't shipped... bonehead move...  
I just remember thinking about how the cost of electricity made it where I was basically breaking even, trading cost of electricity for BTC and how having extra programs running on my computer was annoying... But with the price of BTC now all of that would have been worth it...
So I guess my only regret(s) can be boiled down to not sticking with Bitcoin/Mining Bitcoin. Be it because of my age, the age of Bitcoin itself (and it's uncertain future, especially when looked at through the eyes of a child.) or thinking that I would be able to do more "later." without actually knowing for sure.... or even just thinking that what I was doing was "not  good enough." because I didn't have what, at the time, was considered a lot...

Mine pad for itself in 19 days. It's still reasonably profitable if you are receiving them now. It won't be very soon though.
@_date: 2013-07-31 05:28:19
It was a good move when I got it as well.
The ROI for the device at current rates is just under 19 days. That's at 100 dollars a Bitcoin. And do you think Bitcoin is going to go up over time, or down? I'm not exactly worried.
@_date: 2013-08-19 22:28:18
I'm sick of these giant prices. I want someone to make the next gen $200 dollar ASIC. 
Something that isn't going to break the fucking bank and leave me hanging waiting and needing a ROI ASAP.
@_date: 2013-07-30 19:13:39
There is also the issue of using the increased prices 
My BFL Jalapeno cost me 170 including shipping. Not the 274 quoted here. 
Anyone looking to buy one of these and get rich or something is an idiot though and I can't stand the attitude that if you are not making the fat loots within a few days of getting it than you are fucking SOL BUDDY!
I will make my money back within a month (20 days if everything keep up well.) and after that it's smooth sailing. I hope to make enough money with this little thing to start running it off of solar (maybe, it's just a random fun project I might do.) and as long as I use the funds from it I'm all in the profit. Shit, I'll buy the solar setup with Bitcoins in order to facilitate the community and economy. 
And if in the end I break even? I got some random miner, a solar panel setup, and I had fun, using Bitcoins. That's all that matter.
I feel bad for anyone that paid into this more than they were actually able to afford, or anyone who thought they were going to quit their job and let some little machine make them wealthy. That's just never going to be the case, it's unreasonable. 
Too many people look at Bitcoins as some get rich quick scheme and it's just not.
Edit: I also wanted to add onto this, because it seems I just get downvoted no matter what I say, as if I MUST be lying, even though I have the device sitting in front of me and I'm making exactly the amount of ROI I should be. The other issue is that people keep using the current price of 100 USD per Bitcoin. I mean really? Do you think this number is going to sit where it is? Or go up? If I don't sell my Bitcoins generated with this device till I see a price of 250 USD/BTC than I will have made my break even point at 8 days into use for the product. So not only is anyone quoting 12 months as the definite "You must break even at this point or you fucked up." point, wrong, but they are also not taking into account the future price of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-08-23 08:56:28
Don't forget though, with BTC you lose ALL protection. Your bank can get your money back in many cases. You will absolutely never get BTC back. And the money in your bank can't be stolen like BTC can. I know some people might argue that people come in and legally take your money anyways, but you know damn well what I meant.
You give up a whole lot to use BTC, you get some freedoms, but you lose just about all security in the matter.
@_date: 2013-07-21 11:30:40
That's fine and all, but it's up to you, if you give a shit about Bitcoin at all, to teach these people the ropes and get more and more people on bored. Bitcoin is not exactly at a stage where "figuring it out on your own." is going to pay off. 
As far as I'm concerned, your advice is what gets people scammed. Not asking questions, not getting people with real knowledge of the ins and outs of buying and selling Bitcoins, and just "figuring it out." It's an easy way to get taken advantage of and I don't understand what so ever why you would have that stance.
So how about you stop acting as though Bitcoin is only for people "in the know." and start acting as though you care at all about this "movement." if you will, and start helping people out when they don't understand what this is or how to do/use it.
@_date: 2013-08-31 05:15:59
It has absolutely nothing to do with experience or stupidity. It was a failure in the system they were using. Bitcoins are "hacked." or stolen all of the time NOW, and we have nothing even remotely that large going on. If you think people will not try harder and harder as time goes on (assuming the currency grows.) then you're the idiot.
It had nothing do with "Africans."
And the whole point and the reason these were the main focus of the story or whatever you want to call it is because the western societies had obviously collapsed.

The point is to turn this into a stable, usable currency. Not a savings account or investment. It's just like that now because it's so new. 
@_date: 2013-08-13 16:13:44
That has absolutely nothing to do with anything. We are talking about devices that are already paid for and are already mining coins right now.
And just because the price will go up doesn't mean anyone knows how high or when. No one could have possibly predicted 100 per coin coming from 10 - 20 per coin when people started buying these devices. 
Anyone buying anything in the past few months or any time in the near future is an idiot. 
@_date: 2013-07-09 06:05:03
Right on that very page under "Software wallets." there is a list of four wallets, the first still being Bitcoin-Qt. Not much searching needed there.
MultiBit is already, and I think anyone going nuts over Java needs to take a chill pill. But I will say that the features for Armory are quite awesome, and Electrum is another lightweight wallet like MultiBit but is written in Python I believe.
So people have plenty of options here, no one is being forced to do anything. I do think that the first wallet people use should not be Bitcoin-Qt though. The amount of space it takes up on my computer sometimes bothers me, and I could easily see it turning some people away.
@_date: 2013-10-01 02:02:50
I got mine for 160 dollars and it ran at 5.6GH/s
I made a hell of a lot more than I spent in electricity....
As I said, it's completely dependent on when you got the device. No one is making a profit now, but I sure as hell have.

As others stated, Bitcoin was worth a bit more than that...
But no, I got it in November. And that price was there for a while so most/many of those people got it at that same price. I would have to look into when the price finally went up, but the calculations people keep doing are definitely not taking it into account.
This thing will make a ROI in just under 19 days at current rates. And that's at 100 dollars a Bitcoin. If it were to go up to 250 USD per BTC than it will have made a ROI in only 8 days. And do you think Bitcoin is going to go down? Or up. And do you think I'm going to just sell off my coins at a low price or something?
Don't be silly. It was well worth the investment.
@_date: 2013-08-30 06:46:53
That sounds like an absolutely AWFUL idea.
@_date: 2013-08-03 05:00:41
It's too bad too, because at that price they are reasonably priced. They could make back that 17 dollars in a month, and although the difficulty would continue to increase, you would have at least made back your money.
You're not gonna make much on the things, even at that price, but it's way more fun and reasonable to buy something like that that is going to at least attempt to break even.

I tried to get out at 230 with a few coins but couldn't because none of the sites I used were up or working properly.
It actually kind of pisses me off. If I had more than a couple coins, or had a lot of money in there, I would probably care a lot more...
I also believe in Bitcoin and it's future, but that has nothing to do with taking advantage of a trend. I definitely wish I was able to sell at 230 and but back in now or later, doubling, or better, my coins...
I don't plan on ever getting out of Bitcoin fully though. 
@_date: 2013-09-16 18:38:24
