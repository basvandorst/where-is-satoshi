not knowing how to handle money is EXACTLY what the system wants. I'm not just talking about balancing a checkbook. Could you imagine a world where people were actually taught how equities, bonds, and currencies worked and were traded? Sure they teach 'economics' but that's a far cry from the kind of empowering finance knowledge that holds people back.

oh the irony of all these college educated folks not even understanding what a 'non-profit' designation even means. SMH.

That's what I thought at first as well. But the more I thought about it, this completely unregulated market can be manipulated through any number of unethical and immoral means. It would be just too easy for those with the right resources.
And the last 2 days proved me 100% correct.

I know the feeling. It took me almost four years but I just paid off my loans. Dropped about 5k which sucked when working for not so much, but it's one less thing over my head.

I feel bad for some people's ignorance. Seeing as how we do such a good job teaching about modern finance in school...

that's one of Buffet's golden tenants. Buy into something with inherent value to society that is going to be there for the long haul.

yes. proof that society is actually better off have a good balance between laisez-faire and imposed regulation.

that's just bullshit. You deserve to lose it all if you're seriously taking investment advice from this place. that sounds heartless, and I do feel for you if you've already lost a bunch, but...
Each individual needs to take RESPONSIBILITY for their own actions. They chose to buy, sell, or refrain. It's not up to 'to bring sound investment advice and hold these ignorant fools' hands. They can research. They can learn about risk and reward. They can make decisions for themselves.

Inflation adjusted middle to lower class incomes in the US have not seen a gain in over a decade.
