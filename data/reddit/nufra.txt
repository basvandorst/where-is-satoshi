I discussed with him a year ago about Freenet and MORPHIS and it’s surreal to think that he’s dead. A crazy world were people disappear that way :(
But his death strengthens my resolve in a thing I learned in my life: Better take small steps for 30 years than take one big step and end it there. I thank C. J. Cherryh for that: In her collection of short stories she wrote “Never follow an ideology over a cliff”.
I’ve been contributing to p2p software for the past 15 years. I plan to continue to do so. Slowly but steadily.

So the goal of putting money in the absolutely transparent BitCoin network are tax evasion and preventing devaluation of money?
A corrupt government will just put you into jail (or worse, I won’t spell it out here) if you don’t hand over your BitCoin key, and it will know you have one because it will have a record which shows that you bought BitCoin and that you never sold it.

That’s a tax, retrieved one way or the other.


I think you should rethink that double hypotheticalizing. If you talk about a corrupt government, but assume that that government won’t just lay claim to your BitCoins, then I consider you far deeper in hypothetical territory than me.
Do you remember that gold possession was outlawed in the US once? See 
»The Gold Reserve Act outlawed most private possession of gold, forcing individuals to sell it to the Treasury«
»A year earlier, in 1933, Executive Order 6102 had made it a criminal offense for U.S. citizens to own or trade gold anywhere in the world«
If you live in the US, your Bitcoins are just one Executive Order away from being claimed by the government.
