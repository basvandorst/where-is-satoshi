Yea, but as majority owners of the coins compared to others, they can be manipulating the price. Just by selling and then rebuying. This is just my belief and opinion, I may be totally wrong about them and you can be right. We'll never really know though?

Best advice for people who want to invest into bitcoin, is do it with money you're willing to lose. You shouldn't borrow to invest, or invest money you need for life. Don't expect a quick return, and you likely have to pay a fee to buy or sell with whatever site or app you use.

Don't use it all at once, but bitcoin is your bets bet. Right now is not the best time to put money in bitcoin though. Ethereum is a good option too.

Roy Raymonds sold Victoria Secrets for 1 million dollars to Leslie Wexler in 1982, It's now worth about 7 billion! He killed himself ten years later jumping off the Golden Gate Bridge. I just hope you don't live in San Francisco.

Funny how James Dimon the CEO of JP MORGAN and one of the guys responsible for the 2008 crash, and now this guy both call it a scam. The reason you know its not a scam is because if it was they would be behind it rather than against it!
