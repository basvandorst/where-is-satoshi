I like your video you are good, tank you .   My English is not perfect do.  
But visa and the others are no afraid. I know in the community of crypto you saying Jamie (bankers etc) buy Bitcoin in secret ( there’s no evidence or small proof of it).  And i hope they both a small amount lol. Just to understand how it work ...  and more in petty sure they test mining Just to understand how it’s working.     
Bitcoin is so small any kind of wind make it raise or lower it!   Any way’s...   
but you see curiously visa spoke after the congress’s of the G20. And that is interesting!
You can see gouvernance and banking took different position since then.

“Pinto started a business called Dr. Miner where he charges a one-time fee to install a single mining computer in a home. The owner doesn’t need to know anything about cryptography or even mining; the software runs on the machine and the owner can earn from $200 to $900 per month, he says. The machines generally cost $100 to $300.”
Oh yeah????  Really?    That’s impossible!   That’s fake news!

Bitcoin is a small market.  Easy to manipulate.  And I won’t be surprise Bank are putting a honk of money in and sell off few time to make fiat money.   They do this in crypto and on Venture.

Could someone could please explain me that « “When you cut leverage from 15 times to 2 times, it means that anyone who had been trading at 15 times leverage, on $10,000 capital which was able to buy $150,000 worth of bitcoin on margin in his account, could now hold a position of $20,000 worth of bitcoin.” »

How you burn coins?
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:33:06
Ok for goods.   But It’s different when it’s currency.   
Right now must of bitcoin buyer are “investors”.  So there’s no actual real demand for the bitcoin.  There’s no close market accept only Bitcoin.  I am wrong?
@_date: 2018-04-22 02:42:45
I don’t agree 
@_date: 2018-04-06 14:45:29
Goods have a life expectancy, think about car, food...       Currency no.  Currency it’s a complete different notion.  You can’t lose money, it’s transfert to someone else.  You can’t destroy money,  (rhetorical what is destroyed it’s transfert to the rest of the currency)...  so no it’s not cognitive dissonance.
