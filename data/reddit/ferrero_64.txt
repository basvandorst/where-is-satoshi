As much as you hate Trump, he is helping Bitcoin for sure, he probably has a huge investment on Bitcoin so we both win , hopefully no ww3 so we can enjoy being rich

Chile or Argentina, the rest you can either get killed or vaporized by a nuclear war, having a citizenship is really easy and you can have a great quality life , for example a house in the best place to live in Chile is a million dollars, can go up to 1.5 but that's about it and it could also be considered to be high class if your house costs 400k but not exactly rich, Argentina also is using Bitcoin a lot cause their currency has a huge inflation problem since the 90s, I've heard they even have like 50 Bitcoin ATMs   they introduced a bigger bill but yeah, srly think we should isolate from the rest of the world cause the rest is fucked up yet here from middlehalf and up class you can live a peaceful wealthy life, no terrorism, no School shootings , srly the only bad thing right now is the Colombian/Haiti
Emmigration :/, imo it should be the wealthy US/ Europeans who should come instead cause of all the fear of nuclear warheads and self blowing terrorist randomly anywhere , here there is nothing of that and our culture is 100 son of Europe culture, so we speak the same language culturally, can't say for the rest of the countries in South America, maybe Brasil but you have to be very very very rich to be totally safe there and interact with other wealthy ppl there
