I feel for you.  I'm in the same boat.  If it matters, the Dutch police are investigating them and multiple reports have been submitted, but these kinds of things take a long time.  And once they finally do catch them, then what?  They'll go to jail, but we probably won't get our money back.

No it was NOT obviously fake.  It looked very real to me too, and I lost a lot of money on these guys.  There was absolutely no indication without quite a bit of investigation that they were fake.  I noticed that people like to criticize others right after they've been scammed saying how obvious it was that everything was a fake.  I think inside they feel kind of bad for you, so they pump up to protect themselves from feeling anything.  It's a pretty childish reaction really.
Until Bitcoin people only worried about this rampant scamming stuff with MoneyGram, Western Union, and the like.  Well, now you have to do the same with Bitcoin and every other cryptocurrency.  You can figure every single vendor that accepts Bitcoin is fake unless there is a social feedback mechanism in place that is tough to fake.  Even then it might be fake.  Ironically Bitcoin probably spends best in one place - the dark web buying black market stuff.  That's where the honest people are that will deliver.  Yeah, it's the regular internet that is full of thieves with Bitcoin.

It's not obvious or true even.  You can buy Antminers FOR A PRICE outside of Bitmain.  It'll cost you a good 40% more, but they'll take escrow and deliver.
