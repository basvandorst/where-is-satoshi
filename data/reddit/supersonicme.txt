This what this [article]( is about?

I haven't look in every files but so far, I don't see anything that suggests they could open a backdoor via Windows Update.        
Maybe I didn't look in the right place, but all I see about windows update is some technics to [list every installed patches]( 1 guide to install a [difficult patch]( and another to use windows update server on a [non-domain-joined windows workstation]( (a trick you can find [on the web]( .
Yes it's classified as "secret" but it hardly looks like a way to exploit a backdoor. You know what it looks like? Tricks and tips for windows users.         
Now ask yourself the question, what OS is installed on the CIA computers? What kind of OS are the 20,000 CIA employee the most familiar with? Archlinux? I don't think so.
edit: got the first link wrong, my bad.

Of course, I didn't say Linux or any other system are 100% immuned.             
My point was that, ~~a lot~~ not all theses papers are technics of the CIA to break into computers. Some of them are just mundane tricks for CIA users on **their own** computer. And that a lot of the CIA employee are not tech-savy and use Windows and have the same problems that we have and need the same fixes that we need, hence some "top secret" papers on [how to install a patch](        
At least that's my guess. Maybe the [how to list every updates]( is a first step to disable some updates, could be...          
By the way, I got something wrong in my first post, I'll fix it.

That's what I thought, thank you.
