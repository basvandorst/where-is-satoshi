Hi there Cygnify, 
Cointrack.net is a solution for users who need a convenient location to keep track of their various digital currencies stored in a variety of forms.
Cointrack does not store your coin; instead it displays any number of your address balances. It can also notify you of balance changes via email. This streamlines the process of keeping tabs on all of your addresses, especially if they are stored remotely and/or on paper.
If there are any features you would like to see added, please let me know..
Currently supported: BTC, LTC, DOGE, FTC

I am coming out with a Bitcoin game in the next couple of months that uses a model that I have provisionally patented called the inverse freemium business model. It benefits players by paying them bitcoins for completing puzzle games, memory games and logic games. Im not making players visit websites or other rubbish like that.
So you might wonder where the bitcoin is coming from; it comes from advertisers who want their logos inserted into my puzzles. So the user must focus on the ad/logo in order to solve the puzzle and in return they get some bitcoin for it. Of course, as the creator, I think its a great idea. But it will be exciting to see how it actually turns out. If you want to know more, you can sign up for these games early or visit my bct thread at
