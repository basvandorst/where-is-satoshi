You're refering to bitcoin exchanges not wall street futures exchanges.
Futures are trading, but at tiny volume. This is a volume issue. % of daily market cap as affecting by derivatives volume is about to boggle the mind.

The crash will feel like there is zero force going against the selling. It will feel frightening.
The bottom will be a "whipsaw." Usually the most velocity of the entire move, to a level you can't fathom, followed by a rapid recovery. This recent correction in Bitcoin you can see this "whipsaw" phenomenon. I use technical analsyis (charting) to detect whipsaws. 
Usually, a crash will cover a % of the previous buying. (You can see this currently in BCH). I use the previous run up as my guide for how far it will fall. The previous run represents previous buying, and thus, potential selling.

It’s easier said than done. But yes, we’re about to hit the Wall Street game and it’ll be much different than what you’ve been used to so far. 
You will also likely not sell the top. You’ll sell early and feel FOMO like you’ve never felt before. 
It’s going to be hard, but steel thyself to the whole process, even if you get fully caught in it on the downside. Just dust yourself off, mortgage the house, and buy at the bottom.
My personal rule is to buy when I feel my absolute worst. I’ve conditioned myself to it after many years and many crashes. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:10:51
I like this. I'd say the greatest psychological dream of 1 BTC is that it could by a house. I think many HODLers have the same psychological target.

Yeah this doesn't matter to me. It's not a natural monopoly either. Because you think that you feel it's hopeless. It's not. It is a "free market" (no such thing really, but "free enough") and providers will arise to provide a solution or maintain their existing solutions for the need of unfettered internet access.
I COMPLETELY understand your fear, but I just don't care. I don't think you understand how markets work nor how they react to problems.
The idea they would stop me going to reddit or crypto exchanges is bizarre for you to suggest.

What? The first statement is factually untrue. There has never been a medium of exchange that is like BTC. It can’t be debased. It can be confiscated. It’s easy to store and hide. It’s relatively easy to transfer. Putting fiat under your mattress doesn’t solve its inflationary aspect, which is the silent theft of your purchasing power.
Yes, BTC is the most faultless near perfect store of value humans have developed/discovered.
Want an explanation of why it’s the most important discovery? Because money is the fundamental medium by which humans take action in benefit to one another. This is done via trade. Trade is the foundation of society’s order. The problem is when the medium of exchange within society is corrupted, trade becomes inefficient our actions become ineffective. The outcome of a corrupted medium of exchange is wasted capital, less prosperity, and ultimately less human happiness. 
How this inefficiency occurs is via the psychological effects that inflatable money has on humans. Primarily, the concept of malinvestment and wasting of capital. Entrepreneurs invented the internet, food technology, the automobile, and they achieved these outcomes by allocating scarce resources effectively. When prices are awry, distorted, and interest rates manipulated, it is hard for entrepreneurs to plan and deliver a visionary future. 
Sound money means sound planning for the future, which means much less wasted resources. Which will mean, eventually, a profound snowball of entrepreneurs and managers being more successful on the aggregate in delivering and managing the capital of the future for all of our benefit.

The way of the HODLer
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:39:32
I feel this is the first innovation in a fundamental asset type in about 400 years. This “bubble” (I’ll call it that when the heavy leverage enters), will likely be the biggest in living memory, perhaps in the history of markets. Since it’s a deflationary monetary asset, it technically should rise in value forever. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:36:03
A dangerous future event being morphed into an opportunistic one. HODLers won’t be ready for this. Hearts will be broken. The crypto kids need to get some wall street smarts before they fly the nest.
@_date: 2017-11-18 16:32:36
You confuse debasement with market price changes. You confuse being robbed with government confiscation. You confuse inflation with prices. 
I’m actually much older than a millennial, operate my own business in the financial sector, and have studied Austrian economics for over a decade. I have read Rothbard’s “What has government done to our money?”, as well as “Man, Economy and State with Power and Market” and Jesus Huerta De Soto’s “Money, Bank Credit, and Economic Cycles” and countless other tones on this area. Now if you know anything about economics you’d know these are seminal tomes that are huge in scope of which only a select few take the time to slog through.  Which spend a great deal of time on the concept of money — it’s history and application. This is why some people call themselves CryptoAustrians because this is the primary theory that underlies the development direction of Bitcoin. CryptoKeynesians care less about store of value and go in the direction of Bitcoin Cash.
Anyways, you’re likely just an old man with a poor understanding of every concept just discussed and are arrogant enough to think you can comment on such complex matters.
I’m the end, price will tell whose right. Good luck old timer!
@_date: 2017-11-19 21:42:47
Never, ever, EVER reduce your BTC count. BTC has the highest future value of any asset in the history of assets. You don’t part with it nor use it for consumption. If you need to buy a coffee, take out of your pay check or take out a loan and use that money.

This little game that Roger Ver and Jihan did with BCH was pretty amateur hour as compared to what's coming from Wall Street. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 23:16:57
No it’s not a natural monopoly. And I don’t care about these disputes. This is all FUD.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:01:28
The best advice I can give on this is to look at what BCH just did. In a short period of time it went absolutely mental. 1200 was already 100% in 2 days. Then ripped past 2000, then 2800. When you feel that level of upward velocity, you might want to pair back atleast some portion. And just like BCH, which is now under 1k, which is almost around a 60% wipeout from the top. 
In BTC's case, let's imagine a similar sort of pattern of events occurs over 6 months. That's sort of what I'm talking about. Let's imagine it goes 300% and you now feel SO WEALTHY. You're excited, you're happy, it all paid off. At that point I'd really heed this advice I've laid out here.
@_date: 2017-11-16 18:55:14
I understand what you're saying. What I mean is the distribution of the volume between buyers and sellers is more... reasonable ratio. When the leverage is added to BTC the ratio of buying to selling is going to be, from my own opinion, the greatest lopsided bid in history.
@_date: 2017-11-17 23:04:23
Legit this is good? I love the idea of the pin, I’m on blockchain and I hear horror stories about it and it’s making me uncomfortable. The transaction pin is a gamechanger.
@_date: 2017-11-16 02:51:50
Yes, that’s the key. And the problem with crypto is it seems like it’s built on nothing, especially when price gets annihilated. It keeps happening to HODLers at every bottom low. 
It’s important to really get engrained that the Bitcoin blockchain is one of the most anti fragile structures on earth. Especially over the next few years.

This will be different. Most early adopters by the end of the stage I'm talking about will have become very rich. This correction will hit closer to home because people will have built their lives around the gains they received over the years.

21 million limited supply says to me we'll likely have an uptrend for all conceivable future. But, it doesn't say we won't have viscious fluctuations within that uptrend. I agree with others that these fluctuations will level out as time goes on, particularly after the "wall street levering" like I'm talking about. After that happens, I think the true golden age of Bitcoin happens. Mass adoption, comfortable uptrend, wide society acceptance and use.
Anyone who understand Austrian econ knows the nature of deflationary currency and why we're so excited with the store of wealth properties of Bitcoin. But it's also, because it's on financial markets, a speculative financial instrument, and will experience the euphoria and depression that goes with it.
@_date: 2017-11-22 20:40:21
Bitcoin's  use case is protection from government censorship and hyper inflation.
It may have started as a black market medium to buy drugs, or launder money, but as it's proven stability and access it's become the go-to method to find refuge against government mismanagement of fiat, a la Venezuela and Zimbabwe.
If you look at a graph of bitcoin price, it perfectly matches hyperinflation in Venezuela.
This fundamental use is now pushing price and stability to a level that is attracting the next stage of interest: protection from all inflation, not just hyper inflation. This is when mass adoption occurs in advanced countries, and will be the primary price driver, NOT the need to buy a cup of coffee. It will become standard practice to have 5% of one's net worth in Bitcoin just as they do currently with hard assets.
The use case to "buy a coffee" is literally 120 years in the future when Bitcoin has empowered people against government fiat and governments have imploded and no longer can regulate and control medium of exchange.

The volume will be so huge that transactions are a very lucrative business. The coin reward was the original incentive to develop the ecosystem, but when it’s all mined the incentive is no longer required as you’ve hit hyperbitcoinization.
@_date: 2017-11-18 23:02:12
The very act of HODLing BTC is a moral act. Furthermore, once we pass the “asset mispricing stage” where Bitcoin rises to match is societal store of value level, it will be these wealthy HODLers that provide the capital to make BTC loans. This ecosystem will not be fractional reserve, but rather direct transfer of savings to users with full payback plus interest.
It will be this highly coveted HODLed capital that will be lent out to careful entrepreneurs who will use it to create profound economic prosperity.
The era of malivestment will be over.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:31:56
A billion dollars a day you say?

@_date: 2017-11-16 04:01:45
I'm not making a comparison to the S&amp;P.What I mean is it will simply have gained leverage of some exponential magnitude. It really doesn't matter what it is in gross terms, it will simply be of a magnitude far greater than now. We already have 40% corrections at the drop of a hat. Even with modest Wall Street exposure this will enhance greatly. That said, it also ensures spectacular gains on the way up.
Circuit breakers don't do anything, just stack the sell when it reopens for trading.
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:43:40
Why would you ever buy ANYTHING with Bitcoin? You people are fucking crazy.
@_date: 2017-11-16 16:09:39
This would add to it. All forms of leverage have heralded major market events.
1907-1913 - Creation of Central banking (leading to 1920s depression)
1920s - Margin is offered on accounts (leading to 1929 crash)
1982 - Futures and options on S&amp;P500 (leading to 1987 crash)
2000s - Credit Default Swaps and ETFs (leading to 2008 ultra bear market)
2010 - Leveraged ETFs and VIX futures (leading to....???)
So, now take BTC, which is a major financial innovation with minimal leverage due to its infant financial markets. Now apply margin, futures, etfs, leveraged etfs, etc. All of these leveraging elements will first join on the upside, as BTC has huge buying interest, probably most ever on any financial instrument, so Wall Street will join the frenzy, not short it. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:44:26
I made a bunch on that pump. No idea it was happening. Saw the cup and handle breakout around 600 and went long. Switched all the profits for BTC at the low when Ver got whipsawed selling his BTC under 6k.
Been watching it in case the attack happened again, but expecting it to fall badly without it.
It hasn’t happened and I just deleted that stupid fucking BCH ticker from my TradingView. 
Now that the dust has settled its pretty clear to me and everyone how much of a fucking scumbag Roger and is his cabal are. I’m happy I was able to add some satoshis to my balance, but I feel really sad for how many of the newbie traders got caught in FOMO.
What an absolute joke, I hope they all sold out of BTC and got caught up in their own bullshit pump. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 04:49:15
Totally agree. Great to have you on board with your savvy experience. I think the good hearted BTC holders who see it's philsophical value will need experience and perspective like yours to keep steady in the coming years.

This is a great example of how derivatives can be used to manipulate share price, this case, to the downside. This is actually a very very good question and I could write a whole article on how "stores of wealth" lend themselves to be easily manipulated, since they are not governed by the same rules of real economics as I pointed out with corn futures, for instance.
That said, I believe that gold was not easily manipulable until post Bretton Woods in 1971. A true store of value where it is in high demand for this use, will eventually cause great losses to the manipulators. They may succeed short term (BCH Roger Ver Jihan etc are a good example of this), but get whipsawed long term because the fundamental trend is deflationary.
Once Nixon took the US off the gold standard, the store of value feature of gold was impaired. It's value became purely psychological and could therefore be manipulated by price swings.
I don't think they will achieve this with Bitcoin. It has REAL utility. Ask Venezeulans, or Zimbabweans.

Do you know nothing of economics? Gresham’s Law means it will never be a currency. You’ll literally have to destroy all governments (and their fiat) to make it a currency.
Why the hard on for payments? Visa, MasterCard, interac etc have that well covered.
People that want payments have no idea what the economy is actually asking for.
@_date: 2017-11-18 09:48:34
This payments philosophy is so dead wrong. 
Payments are NOT what the world needs. We have many centralized systems (Visa, fiat, banking, interac, etc) that do this well.
What does society and industry NOT do well? STORE OF VALUE.
The killer app of blockchain is STORE OF VALUE plus CONVERTIBILITY (what Square just announced with easy Bitcoin convertibility into fiat).
If you want a languishing share price (like BCH) then focus on on-chain useless scaling. Go ahead, be wasteful and enshrine in perfect blockchain history bullshit transactions like your daily coffee purchase.
Bitcoin has stumbled upon the biggest, and I mean biggest (bigger than the internet, bigger than the automobile, bigger than farming tech that fed the world) need that society has been screaming for since the dawn of agricultural society: a reliable store of value.
For god sake you are literally a part of the greatest innovation in human history and you’re fucking upset it’s a bit expensive to buy your coffee with!

50-60% crash when it was worth little and hadn't dramatically made people wealthy is much different than when a holder of 2 BTC is wealthy and their live if dramatically changed due to BTC. Imagine the great majority of the viewers of this subreddit are now wealthy, millionaires lets say.
