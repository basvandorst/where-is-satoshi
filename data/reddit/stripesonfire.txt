And if you had held you'd be up over 100x

The one thing I've learned while from following crypto the past 5 years and never claim you know shit about what will happen.     And if you really believe that why don't you out your money where your mouth is And short it.  Everyone I talk to that calls bitcoin a scam or fake or whatever else just repeats whatever they hear from the talking idiots on the news who don't know shit.  Do your own research and form your own opinion.
Imo it's disruptive technology that is going to be attacked from all sides from the legacy economy. The upside on bitcoin and crypto is unfathomable. Sure it could always   lose 99% of its value but the potential reward is insane.

Mines all in foreign and emerging market funds...up like 30%...feels so miniscule compared to bitcoin...and it's weird knowing that 30% is a historically amazing return.

Yea, cause it's impossible to convert it to usd or whatever other currency.

As if the $5 in my wallet is intrinsically worth anything...other than what we all agree it's worth.

it matters to the merchant...cash flow is a thing.

Banks are federally insured on their Fed deposits...of course the Fed isn't going to allow companies that sell a federally illegal product to keep deposits at a bank.

exactly, those who bought at 1200 or even 800 that are now panic seliing are dumb as shit. they either have no idea what bitcoin is or were investing money they shouldn't have been investing to begin with.

it took a week to get the verification answers correct even though i'm 100% positive i answered everything correctly everytime.

I think his point is don't spend everything you have at what you preceive to be the bottom.  spend some and if it goes down further buy some more and so on.
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:50:27
that doesn't make sense...why do you have money in bitcoins that you absolutely need for bills?
