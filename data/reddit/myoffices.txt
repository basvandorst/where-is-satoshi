The beauty of bitcoin is it shows a new generation what hope is. This possibility shows what risk is and it teaches the millennials all about HODL and trading thus preparing them for a future of : if you put nothing in don't expect to free load and get something out.

There are a lot of people left out in the beginning- Szabo, Hal Finney, Theymos, Adam Back, Wei Dai Please include. Jarvis, Hearn in the beginning - Nice work.

When Satoshi returns and bring back IP address to IP address 0 confirm 1-sat/b transaction then it becomes a real payment platform plus store of value. Everything was put into the soup recipe from day 1.

There was an old twilight zone episode that inspired Satoshi- IMHO Rip Van Winkle Caper where the stranger is in the desert  He offers gold as a reward for helping him to town. But in this future gold is worthless.

Its time to do a network study. The block by block study should show where the pool bottleneck is coming from. Once the attackers run out of money the mempool decreases. 
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:38:35
I think the first block was mined a few days before for 6 days arriving on the 3rd then the second block completed on the 9th six days after and so forth. It would take that long to mine a block in those days with a reward of 50 BTC. Everything was mathematical with Satoshi it seems.

Martti Malmi made the linux version. Integral in that area. Really key since Satoshi did not know Linux coding.

Some of that hash rate is for transactions not just for new coins right? Just curious if there is another hash rate for New Bitblocks or blocks transferred from one buyer to a seller in a transaction.

There is the point: most people think people in these countries only have 5k some have much more than that but they have no banks. Your cash is always good but when your assets are transferable because you now have a bank things change. Scenario person bout 10 bitcoins for 100 bucks now worth 100k has an option to leave with access to 100k. Try walking across the border with 100k in a crisis. BTW the 5k was what the guard at the border charged you to get your family across to safety ... now what.
@_date: 2018-01-30 10:05:08
You think the guard is going to take a straight out bribe or a secret bribe. If you ever had to experience the situation then you would know a guard getting caught gets shot in that circumstance. We both start with cash but all yours &amp; mine are taken who survives? We both cross the border but now once across you work for me since I have the assets to rebuild. Checkmate

He is very much alive ask Andresen. He has been emailing him but no response has been provided. So prepare for the return very soon. A good source told me this recently. Spread the word.

Satoshi was a true visionary &amp; he knew the answer before the question. When asked he knew that by taking the .org even though the .com site was not used for his message it would circumvent any claim by making the project open source &amp; protect the intellectual property from theft.
Then he registered the bitcointalk.com to allow for discussion which was truly innovative to get public feedback. BCASH buying the name is a smart move by Ver. If you consider both versions like $50 bills &amp; $100 bills then they all can survive in the same ecosystem. In one you store the higher values and in the other you store your coffee money you want to use on the go. 
Its time to solidify and unite under one umbrella to win the war. Satoshi answered many questions in the early days. Everything he did was to timestamp his legacy a few words at a time. Brilliant move making it open source. 
He needs to return soon.

In the beginning the users were the nodes. Then the complications of the equations increased intense and the networks grew to the point where only the miners had the equipment to handle the processing. It was all built in and anticipated. Easy to Start was the key phrase which meant it had a growth plan. But the alternative to get a free transaction was not given anymore. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:22:51
As I understand the value comes from the price to obtain each coin. If the value to generate 1 coin is X that becomes the price based on supply and demand. If bitcoin transactions create a value that value gets added to the equation like the P/E of a stock. Then the cost to mine a coin must also be input into the equation to bring the final point. If the price to mine is 100000k now then to dig up that one coin would include that price plus all other value factors. Demand should be based on how much coins are offered for sale and the value of the network in fees. As a store of value how much value is it storing. Then how much value is it creating in fees plus how much it cost to move that value makes up the starting value.

Agreed. When the founder created the platform he welcomed competition to allow for proof of work down to allowing copycats to enter the arena. The system is adapting like nothing ever seen before. Its fighting man and machine and it works. It may be slow but someone said when you are running away in the middle of the night from men with guns which would you rather have as you near the border.

This is lower fees before the LN is even implemented. So it shows a major spammer has gone offline as well. Segwit has what impact now? Can anyone explain how with no updates to mainchain mb limit how any credit is being given and to whom should that credit be given.
@_date: 2017-12-16 09:04:58
The way the system is supposed to work. Notice that he wasn't talking about a fee to send the coins. The fees should be a function of the merchants not the consumer the way credit card merchants operate. 18 coins for the product + 1 coin for the merchant for processing. Buying a tesla today should be so easy.

Silence is consent. When the founder keeps their position it shows commitment. If you knew the price in the future was $1 per satoshi how much would you sell.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:50
This was not an advertising it was a mention of my book that is key to understanding the process. If you don't understand the process why are you even in anything at all. Like Satoshi said - If you don't understand or get it, I don't have time to convince you.

The key metrics are still the size of the trades- mostly institution. If they can go up $1000 per week on average we have 50k back in the bag. With the Vix products getting bad press the hedgers need an offsetting product to work with.

Don't forget Martti Malmi who was his first student who assisted with the linux version which was very important. Satoshi today has been locked out of all of his access points by those seeking to capitalize on their association in the past. Pineapple &amp; Jalepenos pizza -

Bit coiners believe in the power of AND while the talk on the side people talk about or. How many borders have you crossed with cash in your pockets. Yes we are nuts. I have friends that bought in years ago who have changed the way they walk due to Bitcoin. Bought houses paid off debt and since they live outside the US had no income tax to pay.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:24:22
Satoshi was a radical and he tried to express his views with action. Matrix and V would probably be in his top ten movie playlist.
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:53:46
In the middle of the night usually and with a team when I do. How do you think I know what I know. My coins are not there to go buy a beer they are there if I need to start a new life. Its about access to emergency capital not convenience. Shoes &amp; socks are for money in a robbery. Bitcoin is for after you have been robbed.

With Wei Dai Satoshi before the release discussed the The network infrastructure can support a full range of escrow
transactions and contracts, but for now the focus is on the basics of
money and transactions.
