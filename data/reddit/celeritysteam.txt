A 2 line comment in a common meme format. Even if you don't find it funny I'm not sure why people are thinking it's an attack.
Not sure why they'd be anti old people either. Crypto offers actual equality. Anyone can mine, sell, trade... and you neither know nor care the age, gender, etc of the people doing it. At most I could see it being anti new people since that means more volatility via panic sells but if you HODL forever fiat numbers don't matter anyways.
I am more than a little surprised how pro statist certain elements of the crypto community are though.

"If the shoe fits..."
If it doesn't fit then you ignore that comment.

Even if that is true, your goal is hitting x amount of money. If you can reach x 100x faster it does not matter if it doesn't hold out forever. Also, for something even be considered an investment it must beat inflation. Just about every conventional investment fails this, the few that don't are even more unstable and out of your control (you buy stocks in company x who puts a token diversity hire in charge and gets half the nation's financial dox dropped, hi Equifax!)
There are risks in everything but you will almost always regret exchanging crypto for fiat, it's just a question of degree.

Just check the comments of just about any of the many mainstream media articles which are the propaganda arm of statist attacks. It's the most common remark there, and the specific subset of old people the thread pokes fun at don't have any other argument beyond that because they are simply hating that which they do not understand.

I love this thread is mostly a bunch of political rage. Not getting in the details of that but just the fact the government cannot even agree about keeping itself active is the reason why crypto will either rule or get banned and rule even stronger from the shadows.

If I were genuinely insulting someone it'd be a lot more scathing and less ambiguous. It is telling that despite being 100% fair and open it is still almost exclusively male, and there are reasons for this (females don't take risks, among other and less charitable reasons) but that's a bit overly red pill for this forum.
I think a good part of the reason why a lot of the responses are high strung is that crypto is under statist attack so a lot of responders are either in a state of anxiety from this or are the statist shills themselves.
The irony of this is that every time a government says we're controlling/banning crypto so there's a dip, people just buy the dip aka move more money out of fiat and in crypto... the exact thing they are afraid of. If governments would rather keep their power they must boost crypto so that people who still need fiat will sell for fiat at a peak.

My point is simply that Social Security is definitely a Ponzi and probably won't pay out because the money has been taken for other things. People can argue if Bitcoin or altcoins are or are not but there's at least a chance your funds will remain in perpetuity. I don't think crypto is a Ponzi, I just know a few old people that really like gloating over every dip or negative happening in the crypto world even if it's something like Bitconnect which is not directly tied with Bitcoin.

And what crypto that isn't dead already offers less than 1-2% gains a year? Even less than 100-200% is unlikely. HODL is a meme for a reason.

Here we go again. Sarcastic amusement = hate only in the minds of the extreme intolerant who project that on others by calling everything hate.
What's actually happening is I'm making fun of a specific set of anti crypto people on a pro crypto forum. A bunch of people who presumably are pro crypto think I'm talking about them, take everything personal then get triggered instead of running with the joke. They then assume my age.
Disapproval =/= hatred, but only the mature know that.
Oh and do spare the white knighting for children, would ya?

Let's say there are 3 hotdog merchants. One sells hotdogs for 1 dollar each and has 2. One sells them for 2 dollars each and has 1. One sells them for 3 dollars each and has an unlimited amount (assume the hotdogs are otherwise identical).
Someone can come in with 4 dollars, buy 3 hotdogs and any future buyers must pay 3 dollars each. That one small "trader" tripled the price.
This is obviously an extreme example but that's why setting off extreme cascade effects in either direction is easy. Someone selling a large amount at once will snatch all the highest bids out leaving the next highest bid significantly lower.
Consider also crypto, even BTC is a relatively small market (= high volativity) and crypto traders love panicking so every time anyone with a large HODL does anything people lose their shit. Satoshi is under the same watch as this Gox wallet.

And this is why I'm not interested in using crypto for ordinary daily purchases. The CustServ teams of ANY large company nowadays are gonna be incompetent or bots in one way or another and will botch your order. If you use a payment method that isn't reversible you're screwed. 20 dollars isn't much but it could have been a large order just as easily.
As flawed as banks are with a credit card if you contact CustServ and get stonewalled you can then contact the card's CustServ and even though they're also often incompetent or botted you will almost always get your money back and the merchant will get a penalty fee for the chargeback.

I'm no expert but the maximum amount of bitcoins that can exist is 21 million and the number of people in the world is much greater than 21 million. Most countries and some states also have populations &gt; 21 million.

California be like hey look we make so much money! And they do indeed have a number about twice as large... then they pay 4-5x more for absolutely everything giving them 40-50% spending power overall. Then they act like they're still coming out ahead when the reality is that money is so worthless there a quarter million a year is middle class. Of course the "poverty" rate is high when you cram a bunch of intolerant people in a tiny space. Then they project their external control locus, aka everything is the fault of (a red state/Trump/Nazis...)
California makes California set its own towns on fire, not anyone else.

I had a few of these people making that argument. They think bitcoin = crypto and people still GPU mine Bitcoin directly. They also thought crypto dropping would lower GPU prices which didn't happen either. Then they slacked off for a few months since NVIDIA cards are better for gaming and barely moved in price until people bought all the AMDs.
I just lol, keep gaming on dual 1080 tis and be that asshole that bought all the GPUs as a hobby and feast on their salt.

They could try but even the dedicated CPU algos like Cryptonight are much better handled by AMD cards. 1 580 = 2.5-3 7700Ks. Both cost about the same per unit (and after price gouging about the same per hashrate but that won't last forever).
