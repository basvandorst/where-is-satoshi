Exactly. Hell there's one at the mall near where I used to live. Unless you were trying to convert large sums of money (like a few K) they wouldn't bat an eye. Fuck getting actual GOLD, which BitCoin is suppose to be a digital equivalent to, is easier to get then BitCoin.

Honestly the vibe I've gotten from the BitCoin community is that its really a community of gold diggers. Those behind the technology want to see it be used like Dogecoin for goods &amp; services, but the community has been poisoned by "investors" who only wish to either horde or day trade their bitcoins to earn profit. The only reason Dogecoin is working is because people are actively spending it and are putting together the PR campaign to promote itself as a currency instead of a virtual version of gold.

As far as I'm concerned you all bought into the Apple Ecosystem and knew what you were getting into with Apple's walled garden. You should have seen this coming as Apple doesn't like anything that can possibly alter the flow of money in their system away from their direct control. As far as I see it you have 3 options:
1. Use a html5/web based wallet.
2. Jailbreak your iPhone/iPod/iPad and install a wallet via a 3rd party install.
3. Abandon the platform for another more open system. Apple doesn't own a monopoly on the smart phone/tablet market so there's plenty of choice out there.

In the USA its very common that software engineers have to sign contracts that for the duration of their employment everything they make is owned by the company. And anything new and/or ground braking must be patented and added to their portfolio. The reasons span from being able to profit off all of your works to preventing you from running off with the next big thing that may or may have not been possible without company resources.

Just in time for the halving. It's probably ready to ship now, but they'll get more orders just as it gets harder to mine bitcoins.

Like I said to gox, Apple doesn't hold a monopoly on the smart phone market. If you don't like the walled garden that is the Apple Ecosystem then abandon it. There's plenty of choice out there.

While I know where you are going with that I still have to point out the error in that number. To use bitcoin requires access to technology. Namely computers, smartphones, and tablets. Ya know, stuff that is mainly a 1st world commonality. Most of the 3rd world citizens are lucky enough if they can cobble together a homebrew radio from scrap they find in the trash never the less a computer. So the likelihood they'll hear about bitcoin, forget dabbling, is slim to none. I'm afraid bitcoin will forever be a gift of the 1st world.

Honestly if they still work for Microsoft or Google that's kinda irrelevant. As a software engineer pretty much anything you develop, even on your own time, is property of the company you work for.

Honestly Op stated the "discount" is just no fees (like the 3.99% you see at bitinstant). Could just be someone who doesn't want to pay fees themselves and/or are tired of waiting on Mt. Gox to get caught up on their orders to cash out.

Considering folks in Greece are already bartering with stuff like food, water, alcohol, gold, silver, etc. I'd say its pretty bad and very likely BitCoin is gaining traction, but none of the governments in the eurozone want that to be known.

Honestly Apple has performed worse anti-competitive actions then restricting what their iPeasants can do with their iCrap. There was a point where I had respect for Apple, but these days they spend more money on their legal department then they do their R&amp;D department in attempts to crush the competition in order to create a monopoly instead of innovating new things they claim to pride themselves on. Trust me in the grander scheme of things very few people give a damn about the hardships their users legally agreed to suffer with. Either work around the problem, break the system, or abandon it. Those are your options.
Sorry if I sound a little cynical, but I feel their abuse of the patent system far outweighs how they manage their App Store. If there's any reason they should be sued for anti-competition it should be for the current patent war they're waging.

Microsoft has -NEVER- bundled other browsers with their OS. Re-read your wiki link, they eased up their licensing allowing non-Microsoft software to be bundled by PC OEM's in their slip stream discs and pre-installs. MS's API stack never prevented other browsers to install or be used, it just had a bias for IE with IE specific enhancements.

I see it generates a new wallet each time you visit unless you bookmark the address. Is there any plans to be able to register a permanent wallet with an easy to remember address if you have a tormail or similar anonymous email account?
@_date: 2012-06-17 03:30:38
Honestly the risk is the same with a laundry services or any other online wallet. Really though I can't see anyone planing on using this as their primary wallet. More likely it would be used as a laundry service with the extra option to pay others indirectly after washing the bitcoins making it a disposable wallet so you don't have to create another permanent wallet to shuffle funds around.

Nah it almost failed once and could easily happen again. They were saved by Bill Gates because if Apple fell at the time it gave lawyers more ammo to be used against Microsoft in those Anti-Trust/Monopoly lawsuits that were happening around that time.  The only reason you don't see Apple putting MS in their crosshairs with their patent wars is for that very reason, they owe Gates/Microsoft big time.

Honestly it might be a good idea is to punish people using hacks at their wallet. For example being caught cheating during a game would cause you to be kicked from the match and lose your bet. Multiple infringements would cause you to be banned which forfeits your entire game wallet and you would have to pay a fine to be allowed back in with your ranking dropped. When the risk becomes greater then the reward folks will stop cheating.

But PayPal isn't a computer generated currency either. They're a creditor that deals with government established and backed currencies. There's a big difference so your argument is pretty moot.
@_date: 2012-06-14 02:47:45
The fact remains when you bought the iDevice and agreed to the terms of service meaning you signed a contract restricting what you can use on it. MS didn't use any kind of ToS to create a monopoly with IE on Windows. Hell the whole basis of that argument in that lawsuit was that no optional web browsers were offered when you bought a PC and MS used their licensing with OEM's to restrict them from installing other browsers which took a long time to download over dialup or purchased separately in a store. So honestly I fail to see the parallels here your making.
@_date: 2012-05-12 17:44:04
Honestly some times you gotta wonder if these "hacked systems" were really hacked at all and not the admin pocketing the money. After all Bitcoins aren't exactly easy to trace and someone could easily fake a hack and send the coins off to their own personal wallet.

When you buy into the Apple Ecosystem you should expect to be in a locked down bubble where you are expected to only use Apple approved hardware and software. Why? That's how they operate and maintain that "high quality in apple products." If you don't like it then you should abandon their ecosystem. Apple doesn't own a monopoly on the smart phone and tablet markets meaning there's plenty of choice out there. If they did they wouldn't be so anti-competitively spending billions attempting to sue their competitors out of the market.

I didn't buy it with intentions of having a dedicated miner. Personally I don't think I will get into mining as I don't have a desktop PC to load in high end GPU's nor am I willing to spend $500+ on a FPGA miner to make mining worth it. I bought it to use as a secondary PC, a portable retro-game console, and/or a portable mini-repeater for the stuff I do in Ham Radio.

Possibly but not likely. The low rate doesn't make it worth it. Hell even my gpu mining sucks because it's not a high end model nor is the pi a fpga. Maybe if I was really bored I'd set it up for mining.

Bought this in starter pack form from BitCoinin.com a week ago with some BTC I had laying around from when it was $5 per BTC. There was a hiccup with the shipping since they ran out of the power bricks, but once they got in they expedited the shipping to guarantee I'd get it in the time frame that was promised at purchase date. They also left a hand written note apologizing for the wait. Definitely a 10/10 and will purchase from them again when I get some more bitcoin. Its experiences like this that definitely strengthen the confidence in this system.
