Tl;dr  Economic bubbles are actually a type of Saddle Point in a complex system, where regulating feedback loops that limit malinvestment and kill off bubbles early are removed by forceful intervention.  These loops include diversity of investment strategies and timings, diversity of competition in the real economy, market transparency, freedom of agents, and valuations.  Spotting and timing bubbles is about assessing the attractors and repellers that make them up.  Right now financial markets represent one giant saddle point bubble that has been allowed to flourish by central bankers removing the regulating feedback loops in the system.  But repelling forces are coming to dominate, and ironically these repelling forces are the same ones that previously acted as attractors - monetary intervention and earnings boosting trickery.
Bitcoin is now acting as an attractor for the repelling force that intervention has now become.  There will and have been severe bubbles in the dollar bitcoin price, but the bitcoin ecosystem has the necessary regulating feedback loops to parse malinvestment more efficiently, making it even more attractive.
Tl;dr tl;dr  Bitcoin is an Attractor in complex adaptive systems terms, and will grow exponentially now the intervened/controlled economy’s primary attractors of intervention are becoming repellers.

Tyler def a hodler and zero hedge in general seems to be pro but the readership are gold pom pom people. Don't get me wrong I like gold as money as much as the next zero hedger but they all seem to be "Team Gold" and have closed their minds to anything else

That's a very good point, they certainly think that, and like you say it should be considered.  It's good to plan for the worst but if you *only* plan for the worst it makes you unadaptive.  Preaching to the choir here but still

"Applications which do not attempt to evade oppressive governments have little or no reasons to use decentralized systems". Not true, it's about trust in third parties in general not just oppressive governments.
Going through these definitions is easier when **a** blockchain is framed the way Vinay Gupta (and others) puts it - distributed blockchain technology fuses the network and the database into a single entity. Wherever you are on the network, you also have a copy of the whole database. If it's not this but calling itself a blockchain, it's just an append-only database, which we've had for a very long time.

Like a horse's saddle. Maybe I should've said that. I'll stick a diagram in, cheers

That's not what I meant, just getting people to see it as legitimate by diluting and changing what makes it good is a huge cost. This isn't ideology or whether I think government regs are legitimate or not, this is about the fundamental reason for bitcoin as a currency - inclusive and unmanipulated. Regulating the fiat gateway tightly reduces these benefits. Regulation is also why so many are scammed, it domesticates and removes necesary skepticism, and legitimises institutional fraud

That makes sense

It's both, so two U's, one facing up the other facing down and perpendicular. So agents in the system attracted to it come into the upward facing one so tend to the middle, hence the attraction part. The repelled ones come into the downward facing one, so just go over the top of the saddle and away. Does that makes sense? Granted a picture tells a thousand words

Sweet pun

Exactly, trust is the central theme. Cyberpunk and cypherpunk thinking about trust in a scaled society is what created it, whereas most think it came from a need to improve online payments. This is why us bitcoiners don't appreciate the classification as a subcategory of "blockchain" (not that you did, I'm explaining why centralised blockchains are different)

Sure, [Complexity Explorer]( has some good intro resources

Regulation doesn't give legitimacy. If you only care about institutional money and the price then yes
@_date: 2016-04-24 21:46:26
True, although I like to think they're a bit more clued up than your average monetarist, which is why I think it's surprising they treat money like religion
@_date: 2016-04-25 04:20:33
I think that's a good idea. You can only understand the decentralisation revolution in those contexts
@_date: 2016-04-24 16:03:58
Yes, here's one -

Yeah, just saddle. Or saddle up and hodl. I like it

They mean for paying bills

Or blackmailed. His patent clumsiness could be a cry for help
@_date: 2016-05-01 16:19:04
I think you might be a little naive
