I would question whether the valuation of a currency or a commodity should be compared with the market cap of businesses.
If we are to view it as a currency, I would suggest we [use the equation of exchange to reach the appropriate value](
    Bitcoin Supply * Velocity of Bitcoin Transactions = Price of Bitcoin * Index of the Real Value of Aggregate Transactions
The Bitcoin supply is fixed at a maximum of 21 million however, considering the number of lost Bitcoin, the actual supply is presumably less,
The velocity of Bitcoin transcations is determined by the rate of transcations on the Blockchain which has its limits set by the protocol and varies based on the number of Bitcoin transcations there are ina  given time period.
The Index of the Real Value of Aggregate Transactions is, to simplify amtters, the equivalent to the GDP of Bitcoin. It is an index of the number of transactions * the value of each transaction.
[The manipulation of these variables will determine the future value of bitcoin and other market phenomena will alter its price.](

Well it is the Chancellor who sets the financial aims for the BoE - who are the masters of monetary policy (but, distinctly not fiscal nor any other kind of policy). The Monetary Policy Committee of the BoE receives these aims and uses the tools at its disposal (e.g. QE, interest rate setting etc.) to achieve those aims.
Let's not forget that Mark Carney has to write an explananatory letter to George Osborne any time monetary policy fails (e.g. when inflation targets are missed by greater than 1%).

Aren't interest rates variable and dependent on things like risk and profitability anyway? If Joe Bloggs comes up to me, and he says he'd like to open a restaurant in a restaurant-demanding town that has no other restaurants (god forbid) and he has a great reputation (been successful w/ investments before, good credit rating, etc.), he'll get a cheaper loan than John Smith (terrible credit rating, has made poor investments) who wants to blow it on some weed. Why? Because banks recognise and reward those who will probably pay back because their venture is profitable/the debtor is trustworthy.
Also, while I like the idea of asteroid mining, carbon nanotubes, and space elevators; the average guy won't directly benefit from these ventures any time soon. Like it or lump it, housing is a bigger priority than space ventures. Why? Because people need houses. They don't need space elevators. Moreover the risk involved in any space venture is huge and profits are as yet unproven. A house in an appreciating market represents an obvious profitable asset, and furthermore, it's of obvious social benefit because the now greater housing supply will reduce the cost of a house and mean a family can find a better place to live comparatively cheaply.
Now if Branson, Musk et al. can show how these ventures will more than *likely* be profitable, the market will accommodate them with a nice loan. If it's unlikely, the market will offer them a bad loan. That's capitalism, folks.
Now if these space ventures will more *likely* be in the social benefit and be unprofitable; then the government, charities, and governmentally/philanthropically incentivised private enterprises will give out a cheap loan or even give out a grant. If these space ventures are unlikely to be in the social benefit and unprofitable, well then you can always rely on [Wonga]( That's a mixed economy, folks.

Alright. He's basically ragging on fractional reserve banking (something not really possible with Bitcoin) which leads to everyone being in perpetual debt. Sure, it's true that fractional reserve banking leads to perpetual debt and leads to some institutions depending on that debt.
The issue is that those businesses which take on that extra bit of debt are often the ones we need to keep our living standards nice and cushy. Pretty much every business takes on debt to invest in capital goods - goods that make our lives better.
So where does inflation/deflation plug into all this? It's all about the incentivisation of risky spending. In a deflationary economy, businesses realise that it's far more profitable to hold their money and not spend - except for that which is absolutely necessary. Sounds great? Well by not taking any financial risks, they're not expanding their businesses and not employing more workers and not giving them better wages.
So why is (low) inflation any better? Well firstly the value of your money decreases if you hold it - unless you make some noice and successful capital investments - so you're incentivised to spend it! Secondly as you expand your business, living standards rise, and the population rises, (i.e. real output rises) you need an expanding money supply  to satisfy your expanding economy - and hey presto inflation's a great fit.

That's wishful thinking. Firstly, the rate of deflation may well increase to numbers where beating the marginal rate of deflationary return may be nigh on impossible without factoring in a massive risk. Furthermore what about consumer consumption? The consumer will not be incentivised to spend on anything other than necessities and capital goods that are 'beating the marginal rate of deflationary return '. I don't need to explain why that's bad in every respect.


You're missing the point here. Regardless of the divisibility of your currency, you will be experiencing deflation which is bad for the reasons I've outlined above. Growing real output and an expanding money supply means the price of goods, in real terms, (should) remain constant in an economy with plenty of spare capacity (see LRAS). In an economy with little spare capacity (i.e. 1st world economies) you want very little inflation so the price level remains flat as possible. **By dividing up your currency further and further you're just reducing the price level - it's just an effect of deflation.** While I'd love to see the return of the shilling, it wouldn't be very good for the economy.

Debt allows people to buy things. Consumer goods like food.
Moreover businesses who need to expand their operations due to increased demand may take up debt to purchase capital goods (say, a bigger and better machine for their factory) and expand their operations, allowing for greater future profits. That money can, of course, be reinvested in labour (i.e. increase employment/wages). This means both aggregate demand increases to match the increase in aggregate supply.
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:04:10
1. Inflation rate should ensure 'price stability' and match increases in output.
2. In the UK the inflation *target* is set by the Government (w/ Bank of England advisement) and the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee uses their macroeconomic toolbox to fulfill the Government's target. I would assume the US has a similar sort of system.
3. The number is (typically) measured by the Consumer Prices Index.
I'm British, so my knowledge is dreadfully Anglo-centric. That being said, the [Bank of England's Monetary Policy Framework]( is very useful for anyone.
The entity,a s you put it, judges that in our top-tier developed economy, we aren't going to grow much year-on-year and our economy doesn't have a lot of spare capacity. Because of this, we need to have slow growth (a low inflation rate). This ensures any monetary expansion matches our slow growth in output and it ensures price stability - year-on-year the price of things tends to increase nice and slowly.
In an emerging economy, you'll want greater inflation because you have a ton more spare capacity.

Of course technological breakthroughs are hugely beneficial to society. I honestly wish companies took it upon themselves to take such risks.
You've identified the issue though, mdanko, "Many people did not see the benefit of the horseless carriage, the telegraph, flight or the space program". They can't see the benefit, so they won't give the money. If they do give the money, it'll be with a high interest rate to nullify the huge risk they think they're undertaking.
You have to see it from the bankers' perspective: he's got to give $billions to an enterprise doing something never seen before hundreds of thousands of miles away in an untested environment where the slightest mistake could cost millions.
Those willing to take the risk have identified what you have, mdanko, that "Asteroid mining can turn rare expensive minerals into common, cheap ones". I'm sure there have been banks that have identified this oppurtunity and invested/loaned based on this profitbalility. The issue is that to reap those benefits, you're putting **billions of dollars worth of eggs in one shaky basket for a (admittedly handsome) return that you won't see for years and years**. Housing on the other hands is **billions of dollars worth of eggs in millions of both shaky and stable baskets for a (perhaps less handsome) return that you'll see soon enough**.
There are enterprises these days that work in the long-term social benefit, some which focus on space ventures. They understand, however, that they're undertaking a project that's very very expensive and risky. They also understand that they might just change the world for the better!

I'm afraid I'd argue the opposite. Once Bitcoin has reached 21 million coins (-completely inactive/missing coins), and output in Bitcoin grows, we'll see growing deflation. To over-simplify the situation, look at the situation as a basic division problem: (Money Supply)/(Money Demand). As the supply of money remains stagnant (at 21m) and demand increases and increases - as it becomes more and more "adopted" (a never-ending movement as the economy expands and output (in this context, in Bitcoin) always grows) - the price level gets lower and lower. Deflation will never stop with a  stagnant money supply - though it might get slower as maximum adoption is reached - and it will be rampant if output rapidly grows.


Really? I would be genuinely interested to see that.


Fine, my argument is predicated on deflation being bad, and here your argument is predicated on it being good. We'll have to agree to disagree here!


Ok three separate questions here...


Because aggregate supply will undeniably have to fall in a period of deflation, you want this because you like being employed.


Of course you do. It's just that you need a job to afford those things. Moroever most people - who haven't got loads of savings -  need to borrow to afford certain things, it'll be damn hard in a deflationary economy.


Of course you do. It is undeniable that Bitcoin deflation will cause your Bitcoin PPP to shoot up. That is of course, if you have a great amount of Bitcoin savings! In a deflationary world where we trade in Bitcoin and get paid in Bitcoin, the price of a good would fall. The issue is the reduction in price would lead to workers being paid less and therefore having less to spend (an inevitable reduction in the standard of living) which would lead to workers being unable to pay for goods and lead to the price of goods either declining further or not being produced (unless they were entirely necessary) - this would lead to a reduction workers' wages and when a worker wants a loan, it's far harder for him to get one anyway because it's better to simply save - unless you want a crazy interest rate. And so the spiral goes on... Unless of course you've got plenty of savings - if you're already loaded you'll be having the time of your life as prices fall and labour costs fall! :D
@_date: 2014-04-20 20:13:03


Sure there's a base rate, but creditors factor in risk and bump up the interest rate.


That is the nature of trade, yes. You would hope that the buyer's 'loss' is made up for by the fact that he's got a nice appreciating asset on his hands.


Indeed and that is a problem of a lack of housing supply and a lack of employment/high enough wages.


I'm not super well-versed in the American property market, but from what you're saying they built housing supply that was inherently too expensive? That is the fault of the property developers being stupid and the fault of the local government for granting them planning permission.

This links in with the Quantity theory of money which is the same equation, just typically rearranged with the replacement of T with Q (which is GNI) to take into account the fact most economies can now measure GNI. It's MV=PQ
OP, the issue I have is that one assumes P and T are known variables, and to an extent, whether or not M is a known variable.
P is obvious as it is the market price. However for economists and traders looking to determine BTC price - the most common use of the quantity theory of money, I'd bet - it is as-yet-unknown result. Even if we were to factor in the market price, it may well yield an inaccurate result as we all know it is a figure that is subject to a great degree of speculation, manipulation, and other market phenomena that skew the price away from a stable true number.
T is hard to determine because of an issue you've already raised - how do we know the transactions in the system are between two economic actors and therefore should count toward T?
M is perhaps the variable we can be most certain of - 21 million BTC - however of these, how many have been lost? We can only estimate that number and not necessarily to a decent degree of accuracy.
If I were estimating the velocity of Bitcoin, I'd take into account 'Transactions to the most popular addresses' which should take into account transactions to the likes of SatoshiDice, Overstock, and Expedia. I'd also take into account recognised merchants such as the ones listed [here]( or on the Silk Road. The remainder are personal transactions and unlisted merchants - the best way to determine what proportion of the remainder are between two economic actors would presumably be to take a survey and use the data accrued from there and extrapolate it. I would say this gives an accurate number of inter-party bitcoin transactions.
This figure would, of course, allow for a more accurate T figure too.

I see your point. When I said that they would 'control the price as they controll the supply', I meant they would, through better economies of scale &amp; better equipment, offer a lower price and thereby price out the smaller miners who would, as you've said, "stop mining, switch to more profitable alts or upgrade their equipment".
However, consumer demand does determine the price as the quantity of issued Bitcoin is greater than that of new Bitcoin. Therefore other determinants of demand come into play. However I would say that, though perhaps comparatively small, the large miners' need to profit would set the price to an extent.

It should be subject to capital gains tax if profits are made via forex.
Bitcoin goods and services purchases should be subject to the same taxes a GBP goods and services purchase is currently subject to.
A merchant who accepts bitcoin should pay, int erms of tax, the same as they would do in GBP.
Just treat it like ordinary money - VAT is inappropriate as this isn't a good or service we're trading.
Now what Bitcoin innovators might want to look at is a specific tax as opposed to an ad valorem one. Should we see prices stay high and stable, there could be a n argument for charging taxes based on a unit of bitcoin as opposed to the value of a bitcoin.
So instead of having, say, a 15% tax on £100 of Bitcoin - taxing £15, you'd put out a rate of charging, say, £30/bitcoin. I think the latter would massively encourage Bitcoin trading, ensure money laundering stays minimal and would allow the government to rake in a bit of extra moolah.
A little addendum: I'm not sure if there are specific reliefs or other dispensations for companies/individuals who are involved in forex trading - if there are, those should be applied to bitcoin.
