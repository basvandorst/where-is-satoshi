I don't understand why people are upset at Coinbase for this. Segwit for them was contingent on 2x as per the NYA. No 2x = no Segwit. You guys should all be blaming the No2xers for fucking this up.

I was paranoid of Chase closing my account too. So before I withdrew my sold bitcoins I went into a branch and talked to a clerk and they added a note to my account. So far so good.

It's just fanaticism. Replace Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash with Xbox vs Playstation and you basically get the same thing.

None of this would have happened if people didn't bitch and moan about Segwit 2x being a closed-door deal. Coinbase wanted a block size increase and now it's going to get it.

Yup, this is what I'm going through right now. I bought the dip last week and now the whole thing is crashing down. I'm just going to sit back and watch my money get flushed down the drain.

Like-kind exchanges involve a lengthy process that's much more involved than clicking a few buttons on an exchange. I'm willing to bet 99.9% of the people who are trying to use the like-kind exemption have not followed this process. So if you didn't follow the like-kind process should you file for it? Up to you, but I'm not taking my chances.

This is a TERRIBLE ad because people are going to zoom by in their cars and think it's a road sign and then get confused and miss the exit they were supposed to take because they're still trying to process what they just saw.
