Nope. One of the reasons metals are used as a currency is exactly because they have intrinsic value in industry. Gold has a lot of uses in electronics, computing, medicine, and aerospace. If everyone rejected gold as a currency, it would still be valuable. If people exclude the industrial value of gold, it is no better than fiat currency.
I still prefer Bitcoin though.

Fuck off, many people including myself live on less than 1k per month.

Yes, making money is an asshole move. You should sell all of your things including your computer and give it to the poor.

Says the guy wasting energy and oxygen writing his shitty comment. The deflation thing is 100% predictable and exponentially falling.

The thing is that people are getting Bitcoins and instantly converting them to fiat. So the popularity and use of Bitcoins is at an all time high, but the price stays low. A lot of people don't want to keep Bitcoins because they are so volatile, but will once the price is somewhat stable.

I think a big part of it wasnt. But then people freaked out and made it worse.

There's still lots of people that have and want to keep their bitcoins.

For every seller there's a buyer.

Geeks should be the first to know the value of gold in electronics and aerospace engineering.
Gold is a great conductor, is very resistant to corrosion, shields against radiation and heat, and can act as a lubricant where organic matter is unsuitable due to such radiation.
