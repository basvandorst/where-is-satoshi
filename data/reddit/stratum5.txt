This is crazy. They need to suspend trading. The market is being manipulated unless (they are in on this).

I think there is some concern for some. Its a very new idea and I think people will take time to adopt it. As an actual currency it needs to be stable and not fluctuate as much as it does now.
More vendors need to adopt it so we can get some decent cash into the market to hopefully even it out. Right now we can see its being used and manipulated which is not great for the Bitcoins overall perception in the public eye.
I am keeping a close eye on what the market does and whether it does overtime become popular and stable.
**TL;DR Bitcoin needs stability as a currency but its looking good as market**

Yeah. The volatility is off the charts when it comes to Bitcoin. I would wait for this rush to end because right now. I think the price has been inflated due to the speculators.
Right now Bitcoin is the IN thing but with such an unstable market and no downside protection. Is it really worth it? On the other hand it can be highly profitable with a booming market.
If we can see some actual consolidation with a support maybe then it would be a good time to hop on if your willing to take the risks.

Bitcoin is not safe, it is very risky. Do not put anything in there that you aren't prepared to lose!
 I would stay out of Bitcoin because of all the Mt.Goxx issues at the moment as well as the price. If the price drops and the Oscillator (RSI, Stochastic) is below Oversold levels and the MAV (Simple) is pointed up. This may be a buy signal (note this is technical analysis it doesn't work all the time but some of it does). Or you can take a long term view but right now is not the time to buy Bitcoins.
**TL;DR Bitcoins are very highly priced. Do not buy now. Wait for it to drop**
