Call me stupid, I didn't understand it. Looks cool, tho.
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:36:51
Hats off

It's annoying as a steam sale...

Since when is "the cowgirl" non-reversible?

Whenever I need financial advice, I go to the Estonian Central Bank...

Title is 75% of a very dangerous four-word combination. 
Guess the missing word.
@_date: 2014-02-09 09:52:17
Hm... sounds familiar. Oh, lol!
@_date: 2014-02-01 06:59:44


Thank god, this doesn't happen with credit cards. Imagine the horror!
@_date: 2015-04-01 09:55:19
I think it's predatory practice.
@_date: 2015-02-27 15:16:54
That requires comparing 3 stages: old (say 200), newer (190), newest (100). 
@_date: 2015-02-27 09:06:24
How much is "10x less memory?" My mind can not really process this.
@_date: 2013-11-24 07:59:06
I can't get past the bank verification, it asks for a sort code that I don't have.
Also, my country is not in their listbox.

We can't pay our suppliers with bitcoins.
Care to explain how does Coinbase remove the volatility issue?
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:41:36
Can you give a starting address? Google did not give any meaningful result...
@_date: 2013-12-09 12:20:50
Why the fuck would you want that?
My vote is on a helicarrier... well, make it two.

He doesn't have the backward wallet's address, only the key.
If the seller doesn't release the backward key, he still gets only 1 times the money, but the buyer is lost double amount.
The seller has no true economic interest in holding the key.
But again, this type is best suited for reputable seller/questionable buyer...

So some guy hacks multiple neteller accounts - and it's not their fault?
@_date: 2013-11-23 19:13:38
i got that from localbitcoins....
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:18:16
So bitcoin (exchange) can be controlled by governments?
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:47:22
I have 0.0145 or so - I started mining a year ago (for one day), but stopped because it didn't pay off - at that rate.
If I continued, I'd have around 2 BTC by now.
Edit: correction, I have 0.01867853 BTC
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:02:33
I wouldn't say threat. Execution squad.
@_date: 2013-12-19 15:08:38
It's not fair linking an almost 20 year old article, especially about a fast-developing industry as IT.
@_date: 2013-11-27 14:17:16
฿: Free money!*
*Not controlled by any agency or goverment.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:14:26
O nice, thanks!
Yeah, this is just about what I proposed :)
So it's already done.. hmmm.. nevermind.
@_date: 2013-11-23 10:20:03
Please don't forget that right now, BTC is quite volatile, so you may need to adjust your prices daily...
@_date: 2013-11-28 11:17:30
Thanks for the info, I'll save this for implementation.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:05:09
where = were
shrink = sink
"through" - correct spelling
missing commas
Anyway, good job.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:39:24
...And it failed.
@_date: 2013-11-23 20:15:56
@_date: 2013-12-19 14:56:00
Yes, don't commit suicide.
Your coins would be trapped FOREVER.
Think of the coins!
Sell out first...
@_date: 2013-11-28 10:10:25
Thanks, I'll save this address as reference for the implementation.
@_date: 2013-12-04 06:09:08
In order to spend, you have to have it, and be willing to let it go.
I have neither of those.
@_date: 2013-12-21 08:16:28
They are not archaic, they are greedy.
@_date: 2013-12-17 14:40:36
Give it a second thought. As I mentioned, overcharge does not need to be 100%, it's up to the seller/buyer agreement.
You forget the fact, that it's possible that you buy a computer with bitcoins - and you receive nothing, and you have no tool to remedy the situation - your coins are GONE and the seller HAS them.

Annie owns 1 doll.  Sally owns 1 doll.  Jane owns no dolls.
Now of course, doll ownership in the Potter household is only as good as to when Annie, Sally, Jane, Mom and Dad agrees to who owns what. Annie can't just take Sally's doll, as everyone knows it's not hers and will just restore rightful ownership.
However, Annie comes up with a plan. She makes a bet with Sally at school. She rolls a dice, with the terms that if Sally wins Sally would get Annie's doll when they get home. If Annie wins, she would get Sally's doll.
Let's say Sally is honest but Annie is not. The roll the dice. If Annie happens to win, Sally gives her the doll. They're both happy... well, except for Sally - but they're in agreement at least.
However, if Annie happens to lose, she quickly goes running to Jane and say: "Hey Jane, remember that doll that I have, I can trade it to you for your bottle of Corona". Jane says ok, so then they phone up mom and dad, and say: "Hey mom, Annie's doll now belongs to Jane, and Jane's Corona now belongs to Annie".  Mom and Dad says ok, so now Annie's doll now belongs to Jane, and Annie starts her long journey of Corona addiction that ends with her turning tricks on Hollywood Boulevard until one very unfortunate night with Gary Busey... but more about that at another time.
Meanwhile, Sally gets home and finds that she's not getting Annie's doll. Since everybody else now thinks that Annie doesn't have a doll anymore, and it now belongs to Jane. Sally can complain like she wants, but mom and dad doesn't understand why Sally would make a bet with Annie against a doll that really belongs to Jane. Of course, in real life Sally would now beat up Annie with a baseball bet, which is why a stunt like this works better in BitCoin land than in Vegas (well, except if you cross DPR.).
This explanation of double-spend really got me.

Thanks :)

Damn, got stuck at bank account verification...
@_date: 2013-12-17 15:36:13
Thanks!
