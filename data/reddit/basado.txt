Why do we need a side chain to handle transactions when we could just increase the blocksize and handle everything on chain? Storage isn't that expensive and is only getting cheaper. The lightning network just doesn't really seem needed to me.

Damn, I missed out!
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:02:35
Well that's just like your opinion, man. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 21:32:08
Agreed. Happy trails!

:P I'd rather not use fiat, but I have to for some vital things right now.

Solid advice. I think I will sell and wait until the next dip and start all over again.

Clicked your link while I was in class. My volume was all the way up.... But the class got a good laugh out of it so all is good. Teacher just ignored it. Worth it lol.

I'm probably going to take my money and run haha. I bought in at $780 so I'm liking the return I would get. This is my first type of investment I have ever made.

This post should really be on the front page of this subreddit.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:12:47
Thank you! I think that is a great idea.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:43:37
This is amazing! Thank you for taking the time to put this together for me! I will add it to my list of sources to check out. I'm going to be iced in for a couple days so I plan on learning all I can in that time. This is greatly appreciated.
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:40:28
I'll definitely keep all of that in mind. Thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-14 16:39:55
Added to my list, thank you!
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:49:11
That's reassuring, thank you! Ah yes, I was only transferring them to Coinbase to sell them. I am waiting for my Gemini account to be confirmed.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:12:01
Thank you! I will check out everything you listed.

I too came out of the darkness and bought my first Bitcoin. I bought as much as I could when the price was at $776. I feel very confident about my investment and I'm in it for the long run.
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:18:50
I was actually just wondering about this yesterday so this information is much appreciated! Thank you so much!
@_date: 2017-01-13 20:41:29
Love it! May the Coin Be With You as well Master BTC_Forever.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:06:58
Thanks, much appreciated.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:09:50
Sounds interesting, I'll keep it in mind. Thanks!
@_date: 2017-01-25 20:56:11
Ahh, thank you very much! I just received a similar response to the email I sent you guys. Just a worried noobie here :P
@_date: 2017-01-15 01:02:54
Thanks, will do!
@_date: 2017-01-25 18:41:58
Thanks, mate. I'll give this a try.
@_date: 2017-01-14 03:08:54
I probably wouldn't get a master's in digital currency, but I am definitely interested in Bitcoin and will be getting more involved in the community.
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:09:43
Are you able to buy with cash at these?
