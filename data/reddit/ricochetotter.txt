I still have no idea how "Doge" is even pronounced and so I keep reading it as "Doggycoin" which just sounds stupid.  I can't take a currency seriously if the way I read it makes me think I'm talking to a toddler.

Virgin Mobile is prepaid, not postpaid, so there really isn't a "bill" to speak of.  You pay in advance for a month of service, then 30-31 days later it shuts off unless you've loaded up your account with funds.  
I have them automatically charge my credit card each month, but I could also buy a reload card from a grocery store, or deposit money with PayPal.  I could put $10 on the account or $123.45, it doesn't matter as long as I've got at least enough for one more month's worth.  In that regard, it would be cool to have Bitcoin as a funding method, but it really wouldn't do anything particularly revolutionary.  The same thing could be accomplished by having Gyft stock the Virgin Mobile top-up cards.
Though as someone else said in this thread, Virgin is owned by Sprint, which is now owned by Softbank, and they're too busy trying to figure out how to get the US regulators to let them buy T-Mobile that I doubt this would get any attention anytime soon.

Yeah, this fatal flaw was tried in the very earliest days of Bitcoin before people realized exactly what you said and moved to "one address per transaction" systems.  Back then it was excusable since we mostly just had  as the only viable method to "spy" on a transaction like that.  Nowadays it's inexcusable to try to accept Bitcoin while still knowing so little about it.

I meant to include "food service" in my statement above, in addition to retail.  I've edited it accordingly.
@_date: 2013-04-29 22:03:40
I think everyone should be required to serve 6 months in a retail/restaurant position just to see what it's like on the other side of the counter.  I've never served in a tipped position (closest to that would be right now where I work for minimum wage + commission) but I'm sympathetic to the cause.
I highly HIGHLY suggest reading the book "Waiter Rant" if you get the chance.  Maybe it was more enlightening to me as a non-waiter but it was well worth the ~$10 I paid for it.
@_date: 2013-03-25 22:42:59
But let's be honest.  The Bitcoin economy is still fairly weak, so we're mostly paying for stuff with Bitcoin to raise awareness more than anything.  For my purposes a 10 minute wait time is adequate, but I'm thinking about how this would work on a global scale, in a retail environment.
If I'm paying for something as a consumer, my patience wanes after about the 10-15 minute mark.  I would not like to hear "Oh we saw your unconfirmed transaction, but we don't like miner fees so it could take 2-3 days for it to get cleared."

Hey, just wanted to report problems I've been having with the Gyft Android app. If I try to do most anything that requires the app to generate a list of cards I can buy, the app freezes entirely for up to a full minute. Android even prompts "Gyft doesn't seem to be responding, would you like to close it?" until it finally loads and I can continue with whatever I was doing. 
At first I thought it was a glitch in the app, as I know you've released bug fixes lately. But then I tried it again this morning at 6 AM and it worked perfectly fine with no freezing at all. Trying it again now at 2:30 PM and it took forever again. I'm thinking there's a bottleneck somewhere. 
Could you check your server logs and make sure they're not bogged down during the busier parts of the day? I've got a Galaxy S3 so I doubt the issue is my phone not being powerful enough. 
To be clear, I'm talking about anything that loads this screen:

iMessage is a completely proprietary format specific to Apple products, one that Apple seems to protect rather highly.  Lots of encryption going on.  If the best Android app developers can't find a way to talk with iMessage (and Facetime for that matter), I doubt that random Bitcoin hobbyists will find a way either.
I would love to be surprised, trust me.  I'm just cynical by nature; thus I just don't think it's realistic to expect an iMessage interface for this site, that's all.

Bitcoin was never meant for microtransactions.  You can go back 3 years and find forum posts stating that.  In fact the entire point behind transaction fees is to minimize microtransactions that clutter up the blockchain unnecessarily.  
EDIT:  Or at least one of the main points behind it, if it's not the "entire point"
@_date: 2013-04-29 21:57:19
Same here man.  The best I can usually do is link to the WeUseCoins video which is rather out of date by this point, but explains the basic concepts and benefits better than I can.  Whenever I try, I get too caught up in the lengthy technical details and lose focus of exactly WHY my listener should care about Bitcoin or what it could do for them personally.

I'm at the point where I'm going to switch from the standard client to a "light" one. Bitcoin is taking up 20 GB of my laptop's 160 GB hard drive and I really need the space. I just don't know which light wallet service I can trust. 
@_date: 2013-07-30 02:37:50
You're right, and I don't know why you're getting downvoted.  From the Bitcointip bot documentation:




0.001 + (1,413,896 *.00000001) = 0.01513896 BTC.
The "REDEEM KARMA" command also has a hard limit of 0.01 BTC anyway.  
While it's possible that perhaps Apostolate has accumulated enough unclaimed tips that he now has ~.63 after claiming them, he certainly didn't get that much by redeeming his karma.
EDIT:  grammar fix
@_date: 2013-08-16 02:05:12
I'd like some clarification on this too.  The only time I've ever gotten an actual call to deal with BTC was my very first Bitcoin purchase when this guy actually ran my debit card after calling me with the phone number my bank had on file for me.  But this was in early 2011.  Requiring a phone call in late 2013 seems almost archaic.  Then again, the stakes are higher since, as mentioned, SMS can be spoofed.

@_date: 2013-07-30 02:29:18
First off, it's really cool to see a name I recognize jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon, or at least show a tiny bit of interest.  Try not to let us scare you off, heh.  
The absolute first thing to do, if you're new to Bitcoin, is to watch [this short 01:45 video]( for a rough idea of what Bitcoin is.  While the part about mining coins is out of date, this video is still my go-to resource because it explains the basics very concisely and much better than I could explain it myself.  The second thing would be to get those coins under your own control, which I'll explain a bit further down.
Based on the [calculation provided by the Bitcointip bot]( and assuming that the 1.4 million karma I see on your profile is correct, you should have received much less with the REDEEM KARMA command, closer to 0.015 which is roughly $1.50 worth right now.  Plus, the bot itself limits the payout for this command to 0.01 BTC anyway, so that's a maximum of $1 worth.
However, if people tipped you using the bot within the past certain number of days (I think 21 days) and you just now sent Bitcointip the ACCEPT command to collect all your pending tips, then there's no telling how much you "should" have.
Bitcoins are trading at roughly 1 BTC = $100 right now (I tend to use [Bitcoincharts]( to track the price), so just move the decimal point two places to see how much you have in USD for a ballpark estimate, in your case, $63.  
As for what you can do with them, think of it like having a balance on your Paypal account.  As long as the store accepts Paypal, you can pay using your balance without ever touching a credit card or bank account.  Same with Bitcoin.  
We just need to get that ~0.63 BTC into a wallet you have control over so that you can actually spend them, or gamble them away on Blackjack at Bitzino or SatoshiDice, or whatever you wish to do with that money.  I highly suggest using Bitcointip's "export account" command to export your whole wallet to a  account, as I've found Blockchain.info to be one of the best and most trustworthy online wallet services.  It's also fairly straightforward in my opinion and has a mobile app for managing your funds on the go.
Bitcoin can be confusing as hell for new users (we're working on it, slowly...), so please don't hesitate to ask if you have any questions about anything we say.  
Thanks, and again, welcome Apostolate.  
@_date: 2013-05-29 01:41:42
Not too much.  Really about as much as any other electronic money system, like PayPal or Second Life dollars or whatnot.  It just happened to be one of the earlier ways people bought Bitcoin, before even MtGox started up.

My college's wifi setup acted somewhat similar to this (you had to log in with your student credentials to get around the redirect) but had the misfortune of not working on gaming systems that wouldn't necessarily have a web browser.  Their solution was to have an "advanced option" on the page to use your credentials to unlock access for a custom MAC address rather than the one seen by the page.  It worked well enough until they got a more robust system in place.
Would something like that work here as well?  Default to the MAC address of the device accessing the payment page, but have an optional field to manually specify a different MAC?
@_date: 2013-08-16 01:56:03
Yeah that works, but that's still a dollar's worth.  What if you just want to tip someone a penny (bad example but go with it)?  0.0001 BTC today.  What if you want to tip someone a penny when the price is $1000/BTC?  Trying to count the zeros becomes confusing and extremely easy to make a mistake because unlike numbers before the decimal point, there is no real convention for separating the digits into groups of three for easy reading.
I dunno about you, but I base my purchases on number of dollars, not fractions of $100 bills.  Thus, for the vast majority of people right now, Bitcoins are worth *approximately* 100 times too much for "1 BTC" to be the base unit used to price everything, so right now mBTC seems to be a better solution.
EDIT 2 HOURS LATER:  grammatical fix to something more similar to what I actually meant to say: changed "number of $100 bills" to "fractions of $100 bills"

Exactly this.  Every argument I've ever heard against tipping is basically some variant of "Well they're guaranteed at least $7.25 an hour anyway, because if they don't get the tips then the employer is legally required to offset the difference."
Yeah they're legally required to do that, but good luck keeping the job if you decide to pursue that avenue.  What's supposed to happen on paper and what actually happens in real life are very different things in this particular instance.

I agree, if you don't let it fully sync upon opening you'll have issues. 
I also have better luck if I first open my blockchain.info app and login, switch to Gyft, then it takes two tries or so for it to pass both the address and amount parameters correctly. 
Sometimes I can copy and paste the address, other times I can't. That's probably my phone acting up though. I'm rooted and have a custom rom installed which may be contributing to the problems. 
I've had good luck with Target gift cards (they just use the their handheld scanner) and Amazon.com gift cards. Haven't tried it anywhere else yet due to that uncertainty of whether they'll know how to process it or not.

If you're willing to buy in bulk, Costco.com sells K-cups for closer to $0.50 apiece, less if you've got a Costco nearby and can buy them directly from the warehouse rather than online.  The "San Francisco Bay" french roast one is my favorite, great for people who like really strong coffee.  It's also the cheapest, something like $0.25 a cup in the warehouse, $0.36 from the online site.
Source: I was a sample person at Costco and gave out samples of various flavors to try to sell either the coffee or the Keurig machine.
In any case, I like this idea.  At the very least, it makes people curious about Bitcoin, which is great.
