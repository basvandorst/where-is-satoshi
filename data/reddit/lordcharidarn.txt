*looks at the people that made up the critical mass of every revolution, ever* 
Yes. Yes, exactly that.

“There’s something deeply fishy going on here.”
Clinton (D) – 8 yrs in office. 2 criminal indictments. One conviction. One prison sentence. That’s right nearly 8 yrs of investigations. Tens of millions spent and 30 yrs of claiming them the most corrupt ever and there was exactly one person convicted of a crime. 
Trump (R) - Currently 2 years 177 days. The data I found while on the crapper (because I’m not wasting that much of my time attempting to convince people who already won’t see facts) comes from September 17th 2018, nearly a year ago. Trump’s administration was at 89 indictments and 24 convictions. That’s more convictions than the prior 18 years of presidential administrations, put together. You have to go back to Nixon to find a higher total. And Trump’s already speeding past Nixon, at the rate his administration is being convicted of criminal activity. 
So, yes. Looking at the facts, something definitely does seem fishy here. But comparing a political family like the Clintons, who have been literally investigated for decades, with nothing that has actually turned up, to the Trump family, which in just two years in the political spotlight has shown to have more criminals around them than any political family in a generation, is either purposefully naive or outright deceptive. 
TL:DR- Clintons investigated for decades, no crimes. Trump investigated for 2 years, such crimes, much convictions. No informed honest person would make the comparison.

That wasn’t the bet was for. The bet was for the Dotcom guy’s networth. 
Dotcom would have doubled his worth if he won, lost everything if he lost. 
Billionaire guy is (supposedly) so rich that he’s gambling Dotcom’s entire fortune like it’s pocket change, on what is basically a coin toss.

What ‘last post’?

Nope. That’s your job; since you’re making the claim it’s your responsibility to provide the data to back it up. If it’s ‘right there’, go get it. 
If you can’t even be bothered to do that, why should I bother wasting my time, listening to you?

Yay. My money is safely stored in Bitcoin. Where it can’t be accesed because the government cracked down on internet usage. Or because the government made it illegal to process transactions with bitcoin and no honest merchants will take it as payment, or it never catches on mainstream and Walmart won’t accept it the same way they won’t accept German Marks.
The Bitcoins themselves might be super safe, but there are many ways for government or corporate interests to interfer with the exchange process. And wealth you can’t spend is useless, since its sole function is as a medium of exchange.
Idealism is great, but Bitcoin is still far away from being practical for everyday use as a currency.

Same here. Bought Thursday night. Spent all of Friday working, only to see I missed the 11k dip. Oh well. I’m not investing, just playing for fun with safe money.

No, he’s saying that her only qualifications being ‘Rich’ and ‘White’ is what makes her unqualified. Being ‘Rich’ and ‘White’ should not be the only necessary qualifications to be a US Senator. 
But it so often is.
@_date: 2019-11-30 05:37:18
I have no clue what he’d consider meaningful qualifications.

You do know that the Tax Filing Industry (H&amp;R Block, Turbo Tax, etc..) spend millions of dollars a year, lobbying to prevent the IRS from doing your taxes for you, right? 
If we had a President and Congress that would say ‘Fuck you’ to that industry, the IRS would send you a prefilled form for you to review and approve or dispute. The government already *has* all your info. The only reason you need to tell the IRS what they already know is because there are several Corporations that make money off of making you do that pointless task. 
Changing the tax laws and the way filing works would get rid of ‘expensive accountants’.

I find it adorable that people think that ‘Big Banks’ are not majorly invested in Bitcoin. Just like oil companies invested in natural gas, solar, and wind. 
Big banks and financial institutes probably *love* the wild west of crypto: easy to manipulate the market if you have enough money.

You’re right. It’s because the narrative is controlled by people who own houses. These people have an investment in increasing the value of the properties they own. So they’ll crow about the positive side: that increase in value. 
If the 20-30 year olds coming out of college and grad school were in charge of the media empires, the headlines would definitely be “Wow! Half a million dollars doesn’t buy you what it used to.” Because those people have an investment in purchasing. 
Which is why I’m leery of anyone crowing about the 50k/1000%+/undeniable future of crypto: I assume they have Bitcoin property they want to offload.

That’s because they don’t care how *you* were paid; they will, however, expect you to pay your taxes in USD. And your taxes will be based on what your income was. Which they will know because your employer told the IRS for their taxes.
So getting paid in bitcoin doesn’t hide your money or exempt you from taxes.

Oh fuck ‘reasonable cops’. The whole organization is corrupt; reasonable cops exist, sure. But the systemic corruption and peer pressure will most likely turn them over time, or push those with good intentions out. Otherwise you wouldn’t have cops getting away with murder. 
That massive corruption is why you DON’T allow a search, or even say more than ‘I’d like to speak to a lawyer’, ever. Your best hope of not getting fucked over is having an arrogant asshole who knows your rights better than you or the cop do, defend them.

Unless you have ‘Fuck You.’ money, you don’t own yourself, no matter what rabbit hole or mattress you hide your pennies in.

You’ve got to be kind of dumb to drive with the cash out in the open. Or agree to them searching your car without warrent or a lawyer present. 
Not that this should happen at all, mind you.
