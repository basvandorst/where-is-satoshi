I'll tell you a story...
I was one of the first miners of Litecoin. If you look back at the history of Litecoin, you'll see that it was an offshoot of something called Fairbrix. And Fairbrix was an offshoot of Tenebrix. The guy who created Tenebrix was apparently a wiseass guy from Belarus (Lolcust) and I paid him something like 250 TBX for him to create for me FBX. Unlike his project, Tenebrix, my coin, Fairbrix, would not be premined. It would, however, retain his key feature of using the Scrypt hashing algorithm. I thought it was a fun little deal. Well wouldn't you know it, Fairbrix had a bug. After a certain amount of blocks, it stopped paying out.
Project abandoned, right? Not so fast.
So I get onto IRC asking around for help (I'm in no way a programmer) and me and about 3 others (Charles Lee, AKA, Coblee, being one of them) decide to retry. We decided that calling it Fairbrix again, after such a colossal failure of a launch (IIRC, it was actually launched twice, with each one failing) was going to be bad press, so we named our new creation Litecoin. Someone set up a webpage and I kind of served as editor for that. I helped manage the parameters of the new coin and kind of served as general manager for a while, but ultimately, because it was clearly Charles who was the brains of the outfit coding wise, it fell to him to release the coin and make the announcement.
Like all alt-coins, it was super easy to mine and before I knew it, I had 25,000 of them. If memory serves, Charles even gave me several thousand. What no one really knew was that I didn't really think the project would take off like it did. I'm still a little puzzled at why people value LTC. I, myself, own none. So when they became worth a little bit, like a couple hundred dollars, I sold. I needed the money, or at least, I felt at the time that I did, and that was that.
Fast forward two years later. Litecoin becomes, for a time, worth about $50 per coin. My couple hundred dollars would have been over a million. It took a while to get fully over that.
Now I have a very small amount of BTC (way, way down from my peak of 200 which were also sold when they were worth very little) that I'm just holding. So, the answer to your question is, yes... they exist, but many sold before they got rich.

99% of the young guys on Bitstamp hoping to turn $60 into $140 so they can order a 1/2oz on Silk Road rather than a mere 1/4 aren't on the list, but they make up a significant portion of the traders. Taken in the aggregate, I'd say their influence on the overall market is very much underestimated.

No. I'm just saying that you're placing trust in the guy on the other end of the line when you use a credit card.
For example, I made a purchase with a credit card a while back over the phone. I gave him the information and he ran the card. How do I know that the guy didn't copy down my information so that he could order something online a month from now? I don't. When and if he does, I might not even notice.
So there's this enormous infrastructure in place to handle such events. Why is that? Because it never happens? No - It happens all the time and costs an enormous amount of money. It's built into the very structure of that payment method; that's how pervasive it is.
I'm not willfully dismissing anything. It is true that once your coins leave your account, there's nothing you can do about it. You'll find no argument on that from me. But better consumer security is on the way, in all kinds of different forms. And Bitcoin is what... 5 years old? How long has Visa had to solve the problem I've described?

Let's look at what happens in the aggregate with these sorts of buy only ATM's. The owner orders the machine and links up a Coinbase account to a bank account with a couple thousand dollars in it.
He loads up 10 BTC or however much on the ATM and sets it out in the wild.
Customer buys $100 worth of Bitcoin at $580/BTC. Owner gets a message and he immediately buys $100 worth of Bitcoin at $566/BTC which is the going Coinbase rate. This happens 3 times a day and once a week the owner empties out his ATM and takes the cash to the bank and replenishes his bank account.
It's all buy pressure.

There are other methods, but they come with a certain amount of baggage. So imagine that you're presented with an invoice that is due within a certain period of time from a merchant. You want to pay with your phone at some point in the future, but don't want to deal with scanning a QR code, e-mailing something to yourself, etc... All you want to do is open a wallet, tap some digits, and have the pertinent information filled in for you into the wallet.
You just write the paycode on your hand and make payment a day later when you're not in front of your computer.
I think this is one of those things where people will find uses in areas that seem obvious only after the fact.
So for example, let's suppose that I go to McDonalds and order something through the drive thru. If I make an order, I'll have a minute or so to make payment while I wait in line, but what I don't want to do is struggle to give an e-mail address, scan a distant and faint QR code, etc... So instead I just get 6 clear digits, pull forward in line, and pay before I arrive to the window.
Or suppose you order something over the phone. You have a couple options. The merchant may give an e-mail address where a link or address/amount will be sent or the merchant can use this and simply relay a 6 digit paycode. And the buyer has the prescribed period of time to make payment.
This to a Bitcoin invoice what a Bitly link is to the URL.

The truth of the matter is that cloud mining operations can go for a long time without mining at all. You simply make daily payouts approximating what the actual payout would have been had the mining actually taken place.
It all falls apart at some point like all Ponzi-style schemes, because there aren't enough new customers to pay out the existing population of "miners".

Why is Bitcoin preferable?  Let us suppose I am not to be trusted, and I have your card information.  I can make charges on your card and defraud you, your card company, etc...  This is known colloquially as identity theft.
Let us suppose that I can be trusted and I don't intend to defraud you.  Now... the best case scenario is that I swipe your card, get the money 2 work days later, and pay a 3% fee for the privilege.  Best case scenario is you paying 3% more than I would otherwise charge in an all cash world and waiting days for your order to ship because I won't send anything out until it all clears.
With Bitcoin, when you send a payment to me, I don't get all the information I need to make charges on your card.  This is akin to sending an e-mail to someone else, and then giving them your password so they can log into your account and read it from the "sent" folder.  It's so backward, one wonders why theft isn't rampant ... oh wait.  It is.  The Bitcoin payment fully clears (becomes liquid for the recipient) in minutes and is irreversible, and regardless of how much value was transferred over, cost either nothing or pennies.

No. But each wallet needs to integrate Nakapay into their system.
Let's suppose that you are using Pheeva and I am using Breadwallet, and both those wallets have integrated Nakapay. You can simply tell your Pheeva wallet that you wish to receive 1 BTC within 24 hours and it will generate an invoice, paycode, sign both with your receiving address, and sent the whole thing out to multiple servers. Let's suppose that it is sent to the Nakapay server, Pheeva server, and Breadwallet server.
You then tell me the paycode.
I punch in the paycode at my leisure (provided it is within the 24 hours you've specified) on my Breadwallet and it pull the invoice from all three servers. They all have identical signatures and so my wallet is populated with the relevant information and I send.

My guess is that something has gone catastrophically wrong at Gox and they are attempting to use their own fees to purchase BTC to remain solvent.  Basically, they're trying to cover their losses with fees.  They're trying to eat losses to remain long term solvent.  The market is betting that they won't be able to.

If the podcast isn't going to make any kind of a gesture beyond merely accepting Bitcoin, he's only going to capture current fans who are current Bitcoin users.

The problem with explaining Bitcoin is that it is very difficult, and even stepping foot on the roads of mining, blocks, transaction fees, volitility, etc... to explain the details, gets you deep into the weeds immediately.  So really, the way to do it is to work from the ground up...
"Messages have certain properties.  They are created by someone, sent over some means to someone else, and then read by the recipient.  We used to use carrier pigeons, then the Pony Express; now we use e-mail and phones.
Money has certain properties.  It is scarce, verifiable, divisible without losing value, and transferable from one person to another.  Cash, checks, credit cards, all fill these roles, but they all have certain flaws.
Cash is cumbersome and not easily transferred around the world.  Checks cannot be trusted.  Credit cards impose fees on those accepting them, which means you pay more for your products.  And let's not forget all the stories about identity theft.  The money with have now is better than old forms of money, gold, shells, and cattle, but not as good as it could be.  There is room for improvement and that technology is called Bitcoin.  Bitcoin has all the properties of money, without all the costs, literal drawbacks, and baggage of what we use today.  If money were messages, most of are stuck with the Pony Express; those who use Bitcoin have a smartphone.
Bitcoin is scarce, verifiable, divisible without losing value, and can be transferred to and from anyone with an internet connection.  It is more accepted every day than it was the day before.  The purchasing power may swing up and down, but the general trend is up.  Get a little and save it if you want, or spend it.  Experience the future."

Unless it is cash, it is probably reversible, unlike Bitcoin. That means that some customer pays you $100, you send that to "Coinbase for merchants", then they pay you in Bitcoin ... and then ... the customer (or you) claims all sorts of fraud and tries to reverse the transaction.

The plugin is free and just incorporated into Electrum.
Creating a new wallet gives you 3 keys that you just print out along with your seed words.
You hide the keys.
You take the app on your phone and scan the QR for one of the keys.
You make an Electrum transaction just like normal, and then your app on the phone comes alive for you to "confirm", but really you're just signing it a second time and broadcasting.
The app is 5 dollars. *Would you buy it?
I'd buy it.
I think everyone with over $1,000 in Bitcoin would as well.

I've always thought that just a billboard that ran for perhaps 6 months in the top 10 markets would do wonders. Just do a digital billboard on a freeway and have it say something like...
1 bitcoin = $471.98

Because buying one lump sum on a semi-dark market might be more efficient than putting in a bid that may never fill at the market price. We've had a few people say that they didn't bid high enough on Twitter and the price has gone up already.
I think there's a good chance that the high bid will be far higher than anyone expects.
The goal of that buyer will not be to merely attain 3k BTC, they're making a statement.

I didn't know something like this was possible.  3 things...
The thing about the App store that people really don't like is not only the denial of space to Bitcoin wallets, but also denial to various things that people consider immoral or kid-unfriendly. I'm curious as to what kind of policies will you have in place to keep your store clean? If you don't intend for it to be a free for all right out of the gate, can I suggest that you give the user the option to see the free for all? If the apps in your store go through some kind of vetting process, can you let us at least see the unapproved apps as well?
Second, are you planning any work with the AppleTV, Roku, Amazon Fire, etc... These little set-top boxes can be powerful media playback devices, but they always seem to take a back seat to phones. I'd like better apps on my AppleTV ... will there be any work in that area?
Last, will we be able to pay for the apps with Bitcoin? One of the things that drives Bitcoin desirability up is when a use for it is found that isn't available with traditional payment means. So let's suppose that someone creates an app that would never in a million years be on the Apple Store, but would be wildly popular among non-Bitcoin users (prior to the app), they would now need to acquire Bitcoin to not only get the app, but perhaps use it as well...

Show someone taking a phone order and getting credit card info over the phone. What he is really doing is writing all the information on a post it note doing the transaction for his employer.
He goes home at the end of the day and you see his desk is full of these notes. Thousands of them.
Blank cards, old hotel room keys, various electronics are littered about the place. There's a nice car in the drive way. The whole thing is clearly better than what some sales guy on the phone can afford. The guy is clearly a criminal. Maybe show an ankle bracelet or something.

This needs to be said more often.
"Here is how a typical online transaction works.
Step 1 - Give the merchant or the merchant's agent all the information they need to spend money in your name.
Step 2 - Cross your fingers and hope they spend the correct amount, don't spend any at a later time, and don't keep the account information in some place where other people might get to it.
Step 3 - Watch your account like a hawk for charges you don't recognize.
Step 4 - When the guy from half way around the world finally does get around to spending money in your name, you must now go through a ton of hassle trying to reclaim your funds."

**So... what would you say you do around here?**
Well, I warn people about obvious dangers. On the off chance that people still hurt themselves with the obvious dangers, they can come to me and complain. I'm a good paid listener.

It is a wonder anyone selling hashing power in whatever form is able to do so at all.
@_date: 2014-10-22 22:29:16
It is 6 digits in the place of all the other options. There's no need for anything else. All you do is enter the digits and the wallet is able to pull the relevant information from the invoice stored on the server(s). There is this idea that if you're going to do a transaction with someone, you must establish a strong connection with them, whether that is physical (QR code in a situation where the parties are standing with each other), proximal (wi-fi, NFC, bluetooth, etc...), or through some means of communication (e-mail, SMS, etc...).
These are burdens that don't need to be there. If you want someone to give you cash, you don't first ask them for an e-mail address. Why, if we're dealing with digital money, should Bitcoin be any different?

It seems like a quasi idle could be enforced by simply limiting mining to a period of time. Let's say block 0 starts the clock at 0:00. Then, minutes 1-9 are strictly for gathering transactions to include in the block. 9:00 to 9:30 are used to mine and everyone submits their lowest hash. 9:30 to 10:00 are for everyone to find consensus on who got the lowest hash.
The next block includes the transactions from 9:00 to 19:00.

You just have to work backward from the customer and see how far back you can go. So lets say you're a burger place and you have 3 main suppliers. Bread, meat, vegetable.
Now you work backward. Try to get those suppliers to accept Bitcoin in addition to fiat.
But it goes further, because those suppliers have suppliers of their own. The bread people have wheat, oven, and electrical suppliers.
Where you really start to see benefits is when the Bitcoin moving down the line end up in the hands of people who aren't going to immediately convert to fiat, which is why employees getting paid in Bitcoin is such a huge deal. The sooner you close that loop, the better.
But if after the initial purchase, the initial supplier (Newegg or whatever) doesn't have a bunch of employees clamoring for Bitcoin, they need to pass them along somewhere, hopefully up the production chain until they hit an entity that has employees willing to take them as part of their pay.
I'd be looking less for B2B, but rather B2E (business to employee).

I can foresee Mastercard, Visa, and American Express being replaced by Bee, Coinkite, and Coinbase, in the years to come.  Instant transactions are the key and moving funds within a network can provide that.  Even if the individual consumer only has one card (or whatever) with one service, if merchants can accept any of the big 3 or 4, as merchants do now with credit cards, that would be tenable.
In that way, the transactions are happening off the chain, with various consumer protections, the fees that go along with that, etc...  Meanwhile, if you're a cash person, you have what will then be considered an old school wallet with funds that you send to an address (think about that being considered quaint), you may still do that.

Despite all the facts, you've declared Google the market share winner and insist on saying Apple doesn't innovate, has ponzi traits, is considered a joke in the technology world (I guess that's why the tech press didn't bother attending the announcement...), and their customers are zealots convinced of an untruth.
Who's the zealot again?
I never disputed Apple's market share. But that's not the relevant thing, we're not comparing charities who have a mission statement of getting their platform into as many hands as possible; we're comparing large corporate superpowers who are trying to make money for their shareholders. Google makes tons of money and moves tons of product (much of it software on junk hardware), but let's face it - Apple, generally, crushes Google. When 2/3 of your 80% market share are the equivalent of burner phones ... what's the point?
@_date: 2014-09-16 15:18:48
The reason is not me wanting you to. The reason is you wanting to.
Depending on where the numbers fell, your million dollars for the single bitcoin might yield a nice payday. It could be that at that level and 10 years down the road, the next target is .1%, meaning your million, assuming the target is met (and by that time you have a history of the community meeting targets), you've increased your purchasing power from $1,000,000 to $1,001,000.
It would require lots of people all operating under the same rules. But if the amount of people following the rules have far greater power than the people trying to break the rules, the rule breakers simply hurt themselves.
They pay too much and sell for too little. They eventually take themselves out of the market unless they're bigger than the rule followers, but this is impossible because the bigger group simply becomes the rule maker (sets the next target %).

C - Goal is either reached or not.  If not, password is withheld (optional).  If reached, password is released and Judge decrypts the content.
D - If content is accurate to description, Judge signs off and funds are released.  If content was a lie, Judge gets 10% and the other 90% is refunded back to everyone who paid out.  Good judges will get more business.  Good content creators will get more initial funding.

For people that ask me about mining, I basically put it like this...  Unless they have the product and will ship when ordered, just assume it is a scam that works thusly...
ASIC man says he has product for 10 BTC and will be shipped in 1 month.
You pay 10 BTC and wait.  The scam requires ASIC man to keep BTC for now.
Suppose USD price goes up.  You demand refund.  He sells BTC, gives you dollars, and keeps the difference.  Or he keeps the BTC and runs.
Suppose USD price goes down.  He simply refunds your BTC and loses nothing ... or he keeps them and runs.
Either way, the only person taking a risk is the person making the purchase.

I'm only implying that the common wisdom is one thing, but I think the effect will be the opposite.  For example, if Amazon announced tomorrow that they were accepting BTC, and that they would be immediately sold on the open market for dollars, most people here view that as a positive price signal.
I'm only proposing that it is negative.  Positive for press, adoption, etc...  But the immediate practical effect would be a swarm of sellers flocking to the open market with BitPay and Coinbase and intermediaries.

Right, but that's a different situation, isn't it? Now a miner doesn't simply have a black list, he also perpetually has the longer chain. The situation I was referring to was a miner deciding to not include various transactions, for whatever reason. Maybe the transaction fee isn't high enough, maybe he only includes transactions without fees, maybe he only includes his own transaction, or transactions on a list he purchased, whatever... Quite frankly, I'm OK with that because those are the rules of the game, and we're all playing the same game.

No. In that case, you're not the one finding the blocks on the longer chain. The problem is that this whole premise is asinine.
*Miners should mine all transactions that fit the criteria I determine to be best.*
And the miners each reply in unison - **Make me.**
Saying that miners should not have black lists gets you karma because lots of people agree with that, but it doesn't actually have any bearing on anything because one can no more force a miner to mine every available transaction than anything else. What about transactions without fees, or high fees? Should miners mine those? What if they just don't feel like it. What are you going to do about it? That's right - Nothing.
Miners, or more appropriately, mining pool operators, are independent and autonomous, and some guy on Reddit saying that they shouldn't keep black lists is about as effective as me saying that you shouldn't downvote my posts.

I think there will be at least 1 surprising winning bid, on a level of $1,000 or so. The winner of that bid knows that it will ignite another bubble as the perception will be that that is the new floor. Imagine the Winklevoss twins having a winning bid of $6 million or so, setting the price at $2,000 - You're no longer in a rush to sell at $700 on Bitstamp, are you?
Meanwhile, the twins watch their holdings soar.
Buy 10,000 at $600 over the last month.
Buy 3,000 at $2,000 in this auction.
Your dollar cost average is now $923 with 13k BTC at $12MM.
Watch your holdings go up to $1,800 per BTC. This could be the catalyst of 2014.

And all the water fountain makers are saying, see how great this is? All you have to do is drive to our water fountain, press a button, and water will flow from 3 miles away through a tiny pipe we buried 7 months ago, get cooled in this outdoor refrigerator, and then you bend over can drink it as it shoots up out of this spout filled with gum.
And I'm the jerk going, wait a minute, couldn't we have just buy 100 bottles of this stuff from the store and keep it *wherever we want it*?

For those of you who don't have any, would you like to have some?
Have them create a wallet during your presentation and then then send them a dollar or two in front of the class at the end. Then you let everyone know what happened. Tell him to watch his wallet and let you know when it arrives.
"I just sent John .0021 BTC. This transaction made it's way through and was independently verified by thousands of computers around the world in about a second. A record of the transaction will be kept in thousands of places all over the world for as long as people care to run the network. The record cannot be easily, cheaply, or forcefully altered. Should Bitcoin become a predominant means of financial transactions in the future, that .0021 BTC worth about $1 today, could have the purchasing power of between $200 and $2,000 of today's dollars."
Don't be surprised if more people want some after that.

Right, but the idea is that there is a large pool of buyers at the current target. So you don't get down significantly below 471 if that is the target for that time period. If the target for that day is 471 and there's collusion among the large players to set walls at levels to converge on that price, you're going to need to sell a lot of coins to break through that bid wall.
You don't like the scheme, but you benefit from it because they buy up all you have at 470 and then turn around and attempt to sell at 472. They're playing a spread on a target that is publicly known and they're all saying the same thing...

I love the idea of major money coming into a low market cap asset like Bitcoin and A - it does so without the market noticing, and B - it moonshots to ... the previous all time high.
Let's not forget how little it takes to move Bitcoin. First, buying a million a day for 3 months will move the market.
Second, apply numbers like a moonshot to $10,000 or $100,000 and all of a sudden it starts looking appetizing to even the wealthiest, most diversified investors.
You can't have it both ways; you can't say that major wealth will start buying on the market and then act like the price will hardly move.
@_date: 2016-02-17 14:13:38
I'm beginning to think that major economies are playing a game of last man standing. If failures start to happen, everyone is hoping that it happens to them last so that they can accumulate the wealth of the failed nations while the new currency overtakes the old.
Here's an example: Let's say there are 3 nations and all of them have their own money. They are all overspending relative to their GDP's and have horrible debt to revenue ratios. Then, seemingly out of the blue, 1 of them begins to experience what Stockman is talking about. Their money becomes more and more worthless so they try to diversify into the strongest currency.
"Give us just a little of the good greenback stuff and we'll do X, Y, and Z." X, Y, and Z are, resource transfers, bonds, and other future commitments on the production of weak nation. Sooner or later the weak guy is on the dollar full time and all it had to do for the privilege was sell itself. Well now, the strong nation is even stronger and the nation that used to be the weakest is now (thanks to his new stableish money) not at the back of the pack.
Repeat the cycle.

But you can't not move the market with the level of investment Bruce is talking about. That's all I'm getting at.
So, premise 1, that you can pump a bunch of money into a relatively small market without moving the price is gone. So what does that do to premise 2? Well, now that we accept that such an investment will move the price way up, calling $1,200 a moonshot seems overly pessimistic to me. A large investor just pumped 30 million into Bitstamp, 30 into Coinbase, 30 into Kraken, and 10 into BTC-e, remember?
@_date: 2016-02-11 13:06:07
I'm just saying that the premise is flawed. You can't put an additional 100 million into the market and not move the price. And if institutional money comes in like that, $1,200 isn't a moonshot anymore; it's a floor.

I still remember submitting a name for what would eventually be called the "Jalepeno" and ordering 5 of the things when my name wasn't called and I didn't win one for free. After a month of waiting past the expected ship date I eventually got a refund.
I think part of what I thought was a scam back then was that they'd accept Bitcoin as payment and then if they failed to deliver, they'd give you dollars back as a refund. Too bad the 15 BTC you send them tripled in value in the meantime. In an upward market all you have to do is take orders paid in BTC, fail to deliver, and then refund the original amount in dollars, sell a portion of the BTC to make up that loss, and keep the rest.
Then, when and if the hardware ever did come in, you'd mine for yourself on it for 2 weeks to do a "performance test".

Think of it like this...  You have a private key and a public key, and so do I.  Everyone on the Bitcoin network recognizes everyone's public keys.  A private key will translate to a public key when it is run through an algorithm that everyone agrees on.  So my private key of **joop778** might translate to a public key of **jhg987**.  They real keys are much longer than this.  The algorithm only works 1-way, so while it is very easy to get **jhg987** from **joop778**, it is impossible to work backwards from the public key to get the private key.  This is why you can freely distribute your public key (your Bitcoin address) and rest assured that no one else will be able to figure out your private key (stored on your computer only) to spend your coins.
Remember, when you get coins, it isn't as though the coins exist on your computer.  It is more like the coins exist for everyone at a public key, but only the people with the corresponding private key can spend them.  So if you send coins to my public key **1La9edoK42g9vYnTtFEx3ZyssiZgHSTNLS**, only I can spend them because only I know the private key that hashes (gets run through the algorithm) to that address.

As I understand it, Bitcoinica is a site that allows someone to sell borrowed BTC with the agreement that they will buy it back later.  Bitcoinica settles its own accounts by trading on MtGox.  Someone (call him a whale) borrowed and sold for a low price, meaning there was a series of large sell orders which were filled on MtGox.  People panicked and drove the price down further.  When the sell price (the price at which the whale could buy back the coins to give back to his creditor, Bitcoinica) on MtGox fell below what he originally sold the coins for, he had paper profits.  Because he was so leveraged, it appeared as though he would profit big time.  But his bet came with a risk, if the price immediately went higher, then he would be unable to buy back the coins to return to Bitcoinica, so Bitcoinica reserves the right to take all of the whale's money in reserve.
And that's exactly what happened.  The price rose again when regular trading resumed and he was unable to maintain enough reserve to guarantee that he was able to purchase the coins back that he had borrowed and sold from Bitcoinica.  Bitcoinica then liquidated his position and the whale lost it all, as far as I'm aware.
I could be incorrect in all this.
If you hear someone say that he "shorted" the market, this is what that means.

Aside from tech that allows people to either create smaller block chains, use only portions of the block chain, you also need to keep perspective.  10 years ago, the current size would be a problem.  Currently, our hard drive space increases so quickly and cheaply, I don't think it will ever be a problem.

So people with BTC want the price to go up; they blame the bot for persistently selling for profit and keeping the price down.
I have USD, so I guess I should complain about the constant bot *buying* keeping the price up.
There is as much of an argument to be made that bots are keeping the price high as low.
The reality is that these bots are merely a reflection of their owners' desires to make certain kinds of trades while they are away from their respective computers and pose no threat to the market at all.

If you could force them, you'd be correct.  People holding BTC can't force anyone to do that.  But if a small percentage of the world begins to accept BTC in lieu of the local currency, the USD value would be radically higher, due to the BTC inherent scarcity.

Well I don't think that there are 40 trillion "dollars" out there anyway, but that all the currency out there if converted to dollars would be roughly that.  Either way, one needs to think globally with BTC precisely because there is no home economy for it.  The value will come from what percentage of the world uses it.  If 100% of the world used BTC along side whatever they use today, then there would logically be a conversion rate.  You either pay 10 dollars, euros, pounds, etc... or X BTC.  Doesn't matter to the seller because they're equal.  If BTC takes off for even a small fraction of the world, each one, due to their extreme scarcity, would be worth a fortune.

The difference between your sandwich and TV example illustrates why Bitcoins can succeed.  Deflation critics say, "Would you rather have 1 sandwich today or 2 tomorrow."  At that rate, holding on to your sandwich money on June 1st would yield over 1 million sandwiches on July 1st.
That's why, I'm assuming, real life more would more closely resemble your TV example.  And in terms of sandwiches, it amounts to, "Would you rather have 1 sandwich today, or 1 sandwich with a little more meat on it in a year?"  Now spending today, instead of hoarding, makes more sense, especially if you have an immediate sandwich need.
It also aligns with reality, insofar as there are hundreds of people trying to sell their Bitcoins on MtGox, as I type this, for dollars, despite the apparent never ending rise in Bitcoin value (over $17 now, up from $14 12 hours ago).  Critics say, "No one would ever spend Bitcoins on anything in such an environment..."  and yet, there they are, spending Bitcoins on dollars.

What happens when the pub decides to not participate anymore?

It seems like someone could set up a locker system where only the holder of the private key can open up the locker and a public key signature would be used to open it.
Sender opens locker and places package inside.  He sends message to locker saying only someone with private key UVW can open it again and signs that message with his private key ABC.
*Just dropped off package into locker.  Only open when someone can sign a message giving public key DEF.* **Signature XYZ**
Receiver comes up to locker and scans in the message.  *Open locker that has package from person who signed it with public key XYZ, I am receiver with the correct private key.  Signature will confirm.*  **Signature DEF**

Incorrect.  It is conceivable that the exponential runup relative to the dollar could continue forever.  In short - As long as dollars can be printed at will, 1 BTC could conceivably buy any number of them.
The problem that everyone makes is that they think of Bitcoin like a stock, which is tempting, because it has those kinds of qualities right now.  And treating it like a stock right now is entirely appropriate; people should speculate on it while it searches for equilibrium.  *But it isn't a stock.*  It is a technology, which very well may have a steep adoption curve like microwaves or cell phones.
Unlike microwaves or cell phones, Bitcoins have a tendency to become MORE difficult to make and get over time, not less.  So as the adoption curve goes vertical, it eventually approaches a maximum, let's say that 50% of the public will be into Bitcoin, the value in terms of purchasing power (products, currencies, etc...) will rise exponentially.  What this author fails to realize is that while it looks like a bubble, so long as people value the idea of money, it never has to pop.  It may ... but it isn't necessary.
The mistake this author makes is that he's thinking that when and if the Bitcoin adoption curve approaches 100%, people will be bailing out for dollars, yen, and pesos.  Nope.  Remember, the more people use Bitcoin, the more all those other currencies simply fade away.  Bailing out for dollars makes sense when you're at the very bottom of the adoption curve like we are now and you think that it can't go any higher.  This is tempting with the purchasing power is at its all time high, and many will do that.  But stop thinking in terms of $ and start thinking in terms of adoption and you'll be more likely to hold.  Bailing out of Bitcoin now is like bailing out of *the internet* in 1985, right after you saw your buddy proclaim that usenet usage was at an all time high.

It seems to me that sooner or later, one of these large software vendors would buy something like 1,000,000 BTC over time.  The price would be driven up, maybe, who knows.  Suppose it costs them $20 million.
Then they announce that they are going to adopt BTC as their payment system for their software at an initial rate of $100 per BTC.  Have a game that sells for $10?  Now it sells for holders of BTC for .1 BTC.  As the exchange rate rises to meet this new rate, the vendor sells.  Now they have $100,000,000.  Not bad, huh?
Sooner or later, we'll see something like this, a sort of gaming of the system whereby a large organization can manipulate the price up and profit by buying relatively cheap coins and then offering their popular product to a target rate.

This is going to be answered again and again, so I volunteer this one...
OK... the way the estimations work is they take the time between blocks for the past X amount of blocks and estimate based on that.  When the new difficulty is calculated, the estimate is changes to something very inaccurate after a large difficulty change because they're calculating not only the few new more difficult blocks, but also the older easier blocks.  So if the estimation is based on the past 100 block times, and we're 3 blocks into the new difficulty, the estimate is based on the 97 fast easy blocks and 3 slow hard blocks.  That's why the estimation is thinks *whoa... everything is still going way too fast... the next difficulty 2,000 blocks from now must be way higher than even the current difficulty!*
Can someone sticky this in the side bar or something?  I remember this getting asked 100 times a day during the great spike of 2011.

"Dear refund tech,
There are these things called Bitcoins that people are selling on ebay.  The problem is that they are virtual, but there is a solution.  Whenever a buyer asks for a refund, he's basically saying the seller never sent the coins.  You can know for certain if he sent the coins because the buyer will have given the seller an address to send the coins.
I looks like this...  1Ax8UUgGtUDc2sxVvxJN8Gaoh7pnqMnskT.
So to check if the seller actually sent the coins, go to blockchain.info.  In the search box, copy and paste the address to which the buyer asked the seller to send the coins.  You'll see a list of recent transactions.  If you see that the amount requested was sent at the time the auction ended to the address the buyer requested, it is highly unlikely the seller defrauded the buyer.
Thank you,

Interbank remittance will be much faster with Bitcoin, if the banks themselves are using Bitcoin on their back-ends.  When a customer of Wells Fargo can send value in a matter of minutes to a customer of the Emirates Islamic Bank, without so much as a mention of Bitcoin, that's when it will really begin to shine.  In order for it to work, the banks will need to actually hold the Bitcoin, and if they're going to be moving hundreds of millions on a daily basis, you can understand that they'll need to hold many billions on reserve.  And where will they get them?  They'll need to buy them on the open market, just like everyone else.
But as others have said, even that is more of a middle-game, because sooner or later, the customers of each respective banks will be sending value in Bitcoin itself, bypassing the banks altogether.  If you want to give your friend $100, you simply give him cash.  You don't make a deposit at your bank and then transfer the money to his...  That would be insane, and yet that's exactly what we do all the time, any time the recipient isn't conveniently located near you at.  True peer to peer cash, regardless of proximity.  That's the end-game.

What happens if people are only willing to sell them to Gox for $101?  When that happens, you've got yourself into quite a pickle.
I will say that price stability would be possible with large amounts of money and BTC if it were publicly known that a bid wall of 200,000,000 dollars would not come down under $99 and a sell wall of 200,000 BTC would not go up beyond $101.  Public adjustments could keep things relatively stable.

Exactly.  If time isn't of the essence in these BFL sales, or if BFL doesn't know this, why do they insist on declaring that delivery is right around the corner.  If time doesn't matter ... they'd just keep their mouths shut about it.  In other words, if BFL is to later claim that time really wasn't of the essence, they're going to look awfully silly when the record shows that, ostensibly, time was of the utmost concern to them.
BFL is like the guy who sells you a concert ticket, delivers it after the concert is over, and then acts bewildered when you demand a refund.

Honestly, I think the maximum needs to be 2 names, just like dollars and cents.  Bitcoin and Satoshi.  How much is a dollar?  100 cents.  How much is a Bitcoin?  100 million Satoshis.
How much is a burger?  25 million Satoshis.  Is this awkward?  Yes.
That's why you'll want to say *point two five Bitcoins*.
When a Bitcoin is worth a million dollars, it will be much less awkward.  Watch...
1 BTC = $1,000,000
$1 = .00000010 BTC or 10 Satoshis
Now how much is an $8 burger?  80 Satoshis.  And the world is in balance again.

I'll say it's a scam.  You forget that at the time, they were claiming expected shipping dates of October 2012, then November, December, etc... all the way to June.
And now a select few people are getting units, when at the time the orders were placed, they were saying persistently that they were mere weeks away from full scale shipping, hundreds of units a day.
And it isn't that they're estimates were wrong alone, they were wrong over and over and over, WHILE telling people that shipping was merely days/weeks away.  If it is November 30th, and you don't have vital parts to even begin the process of building the units, then yes, it is a scam to say you expect to ship November 2012.  You don't wait until December 1st to change the ad.  You change it when you know it's no longer correct.

If such a thing is needed, you could get them to do so beforehand.
This could be done a couple of different ways, and one has been done on the forums extensively.  The vendor simply posts a single address and everyone who wants a product pays that address some specified amount.  After the fact, you private message them with some information and the signature which they can verify.
The second way would be to have the buyer and seller agree to terms and then sign a hash of the terms.
"The terms are x, y, and z, and this goes on for 30 pages.  1 BTC shall go to A address owned by seller and shall be sent from B address owned by buyer."
Then the seller pgp signs it.
Then the buyer pgp signs not only the contract but the seller's signature.
Capture all that and hash it so it ends up with something like ... 648537d55dc72f15417f24ce5a5642d5d10353fb7beaebf8d9edc0799b735849.  The hash is the message signed by both the buyer and seller from the correct addresses.  After signatures confirm everything, send away.
Now, not only have you identified whomever owns the address, but also the terms of the contract.  And should the seller decide to deny everything, they're either going to be proven wrong by the signatures OR they're going to need to change up their pgp keys and end up in a world of hurt with all the other business they're transacting.  What I mean to say is, such a procedure would only be really necessary for large transactions, which is why you don't sign a contract every trip through the carwash.  And if some entity like Wells Fargo or E-Trade sent up a message saying that their pgp keys had been compromised, they're going to lose a lot more in business and goodwill than whatever it is their gaining through your purchase/their denial.

I disagree there.  A small amount of leading zeroes are much more difficult to grapple with than a large whole number, unless the whole number isn't ever in the mind of the user, like a trillion dollar deficit or something.  No one can wrap their heads around that, but $100,000,000?  That's easy, it is 100 decent houses in California.  When it is broken down, it becomes simple, and that's what we do.  *Well... I can buy this house, or 10 used cars.*
A house with a purchase price of $5,000,000 is no more difficult to work with than a hamburger costing 76,500 Satoshis.  People don't have trouble with millions, and should BTC equal $1,000, we wouldn't be dealing with millions anyway.  And because such a denomination would be future proof, we won't need to have the discussion again, which is why I prefer this over the people saying we need several transition names.

Meanwhile, Kyle just buys and holds, increasing his holdings tremendously, but not quite to the level where Cartman was at his best.
This is where the writers would turn it into some kind of saga wherein Satoshi is revealed to be a time traveling AI from the future, and Kyle, if he merely holds for the next 20 years, will become the richest man on Earth.  The AI seeks to kill Kyle like a terminator machine and Jesus, King of the Jews comes to his rescue ... you get the picture.

People will hand over $1,000 to get their weird denomination, their 10 pico bitcentoshis, and think they've got 10 Bitcoins.  After they're taken advantage of, they'll be smarter... sure.  But at what cost to their confidence in the people using the system?

This sort of remote hashing may be a scam.  Here's how it works.
Pay 1 BTC for some amount of hashing power.  The mining begins at a point where it looks like you'll never get your BTC back.  So they say you're mining at some rate and they pay you back diminishing returns for a year until you wind up with .87 BTC.  They never mined at all.  They just paid you back BTC with what you paid them and they keep the difference.

I won't get into the whole thing, but  is even easier to refute than you make it out to be.  You are of course, correct, but there is an easier way to do it.
The anti-deflation people say, "If you think the price will decrease tomorrow, you won't buy today."
Well... in an inflationary environment, why can we not simply say, "If you think you may charge more tomorrow, you won't sell today."  We see that this statement isn't true, logically or empirically in the current environment, so why would the first statement be any more true?  If the deflation or inflation is predictable (like Bitcoin is) neither statement is true to the degree necessary to make the argument that either is catastrophically for the economy.
Sellers will sell in an inflationary environment and buyers will buy in a deflationary environment.  The question then becomes, what if we take these to the extreme... which is preferable?  One encourages debt and the other encourages saving.  Seems like a clear choice to me.

The differnece is, Bitcoin becomes more of a sure thing the more people put other currencies into it.  Person A puts his money in.  Persons B - Z put their money in, which raises the price.  Person A sees his gamble as a win ... repeat.
It resembles a Ponzi scheme on the surface insofar as all the BTC sellers who are indulging A-Z buyers hold all the dollars, yuan, yen, peso's, etc, but underneath there's something else happening; products themselves start to be sold for BTC itself, in ever increasing amounts, for an ever decreasing amount of BTC.  In this way, it is the exact opposite of a Ponzi scheme, where instead of the dupes holding worthless shares in the scheme, now the dupes are the ones holding all the legacy currencies!

They buyer will need to show where the item was supposed to go.  The seller, if he sent it there will easily be able to prove it was sent.  So in this case, should the buyer make that claim (we don't even know that), the bank may try to put the burden on the seller.  Keep in mind that this is irrespective of a MITM attack and such a claim can always be made by a buyer.

Well, its only gaming in that they know what will happen ahead of time.  But yeah, I see that this will eventually happen and whoever orchestrates it will become very, very rich, right along with everyone else.  And the brilliant part is that it only works to make the price higher.  If Apple announces that you can now download $10 worth of stuff on iTunes with .1 BTC, the price will quickly rocket up to about $100.
If on the other hand, Apple said you could buy $10 worth of stuff with 10BTC, you'd simply keep your BTC and pay with $, or you'd sell your .5 BTC on the open market at $20/BTC and pay with $ anyway.

Sooner or later, a small government is going to get smart and purchase a large amount of Bitcoins for themselves.  Then they're going to decree that Bitcoins are not only legal, but considered no different than cash, or something to this effect.  Traditional currency goes down and Bitcoin steps in to take it's place.  Government becomes wealthy because they bought all those coins beforehand.

It isn't anonymous so much as it is psuedonymous.  It isn't that one sends a BTC to a person, but rather to an address that a person may or may not control.  An address looks like this... 1HDx964HwwV66pJDFHSKfYusz1q9JWTjo6.  Who controls it?
Unless someone connects themselves publicly with this address (they say, "This is my donation address..." or something), there's no real way to connect a particular person to a particular address.  This is how Bitcoin is, should one decide to take various precautions, anonymous.

Better to work with whole numbers, where 1 dollar will buy you 1,000 Satoshis.

So when mining, you are increasing your nonce and not restarting it until you shut down your miner and go again.  So if I mine for a month and my winning nonces were 100, 200, 300, etc... until 1,000,000, with a predictable pattern, I would show up as a line on this graph.  If I restart my miner all the time or mine intermittently, I would be more difficult to see because I would be scattered in with 1,000 other people who are just trying out the program.
Is this correct?
And when the line goes back to zero, that is just the miner, Satoshi, shutting down his machine and taking a break, right?
@_date: 2013-10-21 15:32:10
Previous run ups have been in that area.  Not to $2,000, but from $1 to $30 (30x increase) and $20 to $250 (~13x increase).  There is no reason to think that from about $150 we cannot experience another enormous increase, like from 10x to 20x.  I'm not saying that it will happen, just that one should have a plan of action **if** it happens.

Well, I think if someone has cash and wants BTC, they don't really need a machine right next door.  They merely need a machine that is a 20 minute drive away.  They way it works now, if you want to do an in person transaction, you have to find someone, which is a pain.  Contact them.  Agree on a price.  And multiple e-mails later, they set a time and place where the guys each become a target for robbery.
With any luck, the transaction takes place, with a huge fee because of the enormous work and risk involved.  I've accomplished this with a fee on 8%, just in case by the time I rebought the BTC, the price went way up.
Depending on exchange rate, this machine changes all that.
Now you simply drive up to the machine and do it, daily if you like.  Always the same place, same terms, and all you'd need is the cash and a piece of paper with your public key.  Honestly, if these guys wanted to sell machines to entrepreneurs, they'd sell one in every major city.

If the concern from ebay is that people selling Bitcoins aren't really sending them to the buyer (hence the buyer is wanting a chargeback), all they need to do is read the message from the buyer to the seller.
*I won your auction.  Please send 1 BTC to 1Ax8UUgGtUDc2sxVvxJN8Gaoh7pnqMnskT.*
Then all they need to do is check the blockchain.  The proof that the product was sent in good condition to the buyer is there for all to see.  Ebay doesn't even need to incorporate a wallet into their system.  All they have to do is a simple search.  Something tells me that ebay is unaware of this.

What this ultimately boils down to is, do people/businesses have any compelling reason to wish to accept Bitcoin.  I think they do.  Imagine having a wallet with some amount of purchasing power in it, like $100 (assuming dollars are 100% stable over time, which they aren't).  So you open it the next day, and there are $101.  Then 98, then 105, then 101, then 140, then 120, and it is all a lot of fun because it seems to go up more often than it goes down.  Indeed, this has been the trend.
Would this be attractive to you?  If you were running a business, with expenses, would this be attractive?
Now imagine that as the market cap goes up, the level of impact a single large player can have goes down.  So now it doesn't go up 20 a day, but rather .1, day after day after day, because more and more people are desiring to hold these tokens of gradually increasingly valuable scarce tokens.  Is it speculation?  Sure, but so what?  The only question that needs to be answered is, will people continue to want these tokens for their gradually increasing purchasing power?  Yes.  And if that is the case, 10 years to capture 10% of the e-commerce seems overly pessimistic.
@_date: 2013-12-06 13:02:17
What I mean is that people have time preferences.  So the theory that everyone will just hoard their coins ignores the fact that people on a deep level realize that having money is no good unless it gets spent at some point.  The classic example people use is to ask, "Why would you spend when 1 BTC could buy twice as much tomorrow?"  Indeed, your time preference would need to be exceptionally high to spend if you thought such a thing to be true.  But at some point, your willingness to spend now will outdo your willingness to save now in order to spend a little more later.
That's why no one puts any substantial amount of money into savings accounts, or at least very few do.  There is very little return for the time you give up.  If the theory holds, as many think it does when it comes to Bitcoin, not only will no one spend their ever increasingly valuable Bitcoin, but no one will ever spend their dollars either, they will perpetually put them in some vehicle that will barely beat inflation.  Why buy 1 cup of coffee now when you can put the money in X and buy 1.01 cups of coffee 2 years from now?  All of a sudden, saving every penny in order to have a little more later sounds kind of dumb.
Bitcoin will eventually get to such a place, where savings will have a marginal impact on your purchasing power.

I happen to agree with OP on this.  Consider it like Facebook compared to Myspace, and whatever else exists.  As long as Myspace is around, you can always make the argument that Facebook is only popular with *some* people.  But effectively, Facebook is the current winner of the social network game.  Other services may not all be zeroes ... but they're all near zeroes.
Same with Bitcoin.  Right now, Bitcoin is a near zero and at least in the US, the dollar is the current winner.  I don't see this as a game that can end up in a draw for any length of time, and unlike Facebook or dollars, Bitcoin is global.
I think there is a significant chance of Bitcoin becoming the worldwide winner; it won't exist in the margins forever.

Well, not quite.  They are only created at a constant rate when the hashing power isn't making large swings up or down consistently in any direction.

The response was basically ... "Umm... you're probably running a Ponzi scheme, so no one will buy."  And no one did.
The trouble with these remote mining operations is that even if you are legit, you still will look exactly like a Ponzi scheme, so you're always open to that criticism.

We're still at the extreme low end of a very tall S shaped curve, where the line represents purchasing power.  Look for it to begin to flatten at $500,000 to $1,000,000 per coin, and eventually settle years later to about $2,000,000 per coin in 2013 dollars.  We'll be completely out of the dollar mindset long before that, but use it for now as a metric.
Go on dupontregistry.com and look for a house worth about $2,000,000.  In 20 years, that will be 1 BTC.
What will drive it?  People looking at charts.  Imagine this...
The year is 2015 and a Billboard pops up on a freeway you take to work.  It is simple.  All it says is 1 Bitcoin = $----17,862.21.  The value in dollars is a live feed to the largest exchange.  A month later, it says 1 Bitcoin = $----21,121.84.  A month after that ... $----27,854.96.  And on it goes.  How many months go by before you start the conversion?  1, 2, 6, 12?  Multiply this by the million people in your city.
Multiply this by 300 of the world's largest cities.
Merchants want BTC, so they start accepting it in droves.
Early adopters are glad to spend their windfall in very small increments.  60% of Bitcoins are hoarded ... which is good because now only 40% of all available BTC must handle 100% of the traffic.  Large holders spend in extremely small amounts; mainly, this is large banks and governments.
Within 10 years, the world has converted.
You stash of 10 BTC that you buy today might very well be enough for an early retirement for you and your family.  Live on 1,000 acres of pristine land in a large estate.

I'm not denying that.  I'm just saying that there is a feedback loop at work here where it appears that everyone in the game is getting rich and everyone not in is experiencing a huge opportunity cost.  The common thinking is that the Bitcoin people need to solicit merchants to ask them to accept Bitcoin.
Let the purchasing power go up an order of magnitude every year for another few years and they'll be seeking Bitcoins themselves.

Ideally, the splash screen would be a question?
"Do you have a Bitcoin Wallet QR code?  Press YES or NO."
If they press NO, then one is printed.  Either YES or NO brings them to the next screen.
"INSERT DOLLARS - INSERT HAND WHEN DONE"  User puts in cash and watches his BTC return rise.  When they have enough in, they put their hand in the scanner.
"Hold QR code under reader."  Transfers to that address.
User walks away.

Do you know why they're mistaken for a couple in real life?  They're doing it on purpose.  They're acting like a gay couple.


You're tripping all over your own point here.  This isn't about a particular look or act.  This is about a pervasively gay theme (at the very least, anti-masculine) in the show masquerading as nerdiness.  What an insult to nerds.  You keep interpreting what I'm saying as, "If you don't even lift bro you must be gay."  That isn't it at all.  What I'm saying is that The Big Bang theory plays on elements meant to be compelling for gay people.  The fact that there are a million online conversations and articles about it should tell you that I'm on to something.
I'm not just making it up.

Unless you control the wallet, all you're really doing is requesting that someone else send it.  Because you don't control that .eu exchange wallet, you just asked them to send it, and when AND IF they get around to it, you'll see it on blockchain.
Had you sent 1 BTC to me and then requested that I send it to that address, you'd be in the same situation.  You're at the mercy of the one who controls the keys.

Here's the thing.  If BFL can deliver soon, then you'll probably be good.  The common logic on their forum seems to be, well, they have infinite time ... so surely they'll deliver at some point.  When they do, people will mop up.  Some people ask for refunds, and that's OK.
But this can only continue if it doesn't cost anything, or they're paying those costs by some method other than pre-order funds.  The former isn't true.  The latter may be true, if there are some angel investors funding everything.  BFL has been running a large expensive operation, with no delivery times even reasonably in sight.  I wouldn't be surprised if general delivery (your order) is another 6 months or a year away.  The question is, how long can they continue before either they burn through their line of credit or pre-order funds.  It is very possible that they will come close to finishing everything off and then they simply run out of money and it will all be over.
Or they're nothing more than a scam, but I think that is unlikely.
I give it 50/50 either they'll deliver relatively soon and things will go more or less as planned **or** they'll run out of money, including your pre-order money, and you'll have nothing more to do but lament your losses.

The 25% attack works as follows...
Pool A has 25% of power and pool B has 75%.
Block 1 is found by pool A.
Block 2 is found by pool A, but it is kept secret, so they work on block 3.
Block 2(b) is found by pool B.
Block 2 is broadcast by pool A.  And now they have a jump on pool B.
Now the question is ... who wins the race for block 3.
The idea is that pool B never catches pool A because pool A always has a little jump on pool B, just like the turtle, who has a head start on Achilles in Zeno's paradox, always maintains his lead.  Every time Achilles catches the last place the turtle was, the turtle is just a little bit ahead.  Every time Pool B finds a block, they see that Pool A broadcasts an older block has a jump on them for the following block.
But if I understand Bitcoin correctly, this only creates a competition for block 3.  The older block 2 isn't automatically favored over block 2(b).  The larger network is attempting to work on the 2(b) block to find block 3, and 7.5 times out of 10, they'll find it first.  And now, for all the secrecy, not only does the large network get block 3, they also get 2(b).  Pool A has their block 2 orphaned.  Pool B always surpasses pool A in the long run is what I'm saying.

This is a way of preserving anonymity.  If you done some transactions with BTC, you've probably done it without knowing it.  Suppose I have 10 BTC.  I want to send you 1.
So my software signs 2 transactions.  It creates a new address (or reuses an address already created) and signs 9 to it.  Then it signs 1 to your address.  Any 3rd party is going to have a difficult time tracking the BTC because they see one address break into 2 parts, each going to somewhere else.  Did you receive 9 or 1?  Did I just send it to myself?  If you are verifying things, the blockchain is persuasive.  If you're trying see how much money someone has now, only knowing how much they had at a different address in the past, and they have done several transactions, it quickly becomes nigh on impossible.

The real way it becomes mainstream is for it to be treated first like a game, second like a speculative investment, and third as a store of value.  We're at the beginning stages of step 2.  Step 1 involves buying a pizza for 10,000 BTC, which is kind of like buying a pizza with monopoly money.
We are at the stage where people are looking to see gains going from notes to Bitcoin and then back again.  This can only last so long and the upward curve of $/BTC will level off into a slightly upward curve.  At this point, you enter stage 3, where people keep it as a store of value.  If the seller of something can get 2% per year in real purchasing power by accepting Bitcoin in lieu of dollars, there's no reason for the buyer to convert.  And on it goes until Bitcoin becomes the de facto world currency.
The error this author makes is assuming that the volatility is A - can continue forever and B - that right now, it is a bad thing.  I cannot continue forever because while the limited amount of Bitcoins are chasing a limitless amount of goods/services, the production of those goods and services is limited.
This is simply to say that if there are 1,000 tons of gold in the world and that is the only good available for Bitcoin, then the 21 million BTC are chasing that amount of gold + the amount that can be harvested in the future (taking into account the amount of time it takes to get it).  So the author makes the mistake of thinking that the 21 MM BTC will volatile it's way up to 2,000 tons worth of purchasing power ... but this of course is impossible, as there are not 2,000 tons out there to buy.  The volatility we see now is destined to level off eventually.
And right now, the volatility is a good thing.  It creates an active market, wherein the old hands give way to new hands, weak hands to strong.  People come in and out because of volatility.  If people want stability, they can bonds.  Moreover, if the fear is that a seller who sells for BTC will lose 50% of his trade overnight, not only are there services that hedge against that very thing, also he must realize that historically, the dollar value has a tendency to go up rather than down.  You don't see anyone complaining when their BTC goes UP.

I agree.  But it could be more than 9 characters as 10 or more would simply push everything to the left and appear as 9.  Can't say I didn't try some words though!
Best guess, the owner of the wallet is going to do some market manipulation or the video maker is attempting to do some market manipulation.
Either the owner is going to move some coins and pretend that his brain wallet was guessed, making traders think an enormous sell off is imminent.  Owner snatches up cheap coins.
Or the video maker has shopped the whole thing and is hoping for a sell off on the assumption that a good guess is imminent.  This is unlikely because everyone knows that if someone has the private key... they'd just send the coins to a clean address rather that going through the hassle of markets and manipulations.

It was always my thought that Bitcoin ought to be integrated with a messaging system.  So when you send a transaction, you also send (off the blockchain I would assume) a short encrypted message only to be decrypted by the owner of the receiving address.  Typical use would be this.
"Selling product X for 1BTC.  Send BTC to 12oosisKqW1CL2CucikfPUufdJQWfgM4pC with message containing shipping address."
Customer sends money plus an encrypted message to that address with his shipping address as the message.  Congratulations, you've just eliminated 90% of e-commerce software.  And not only that, everything you've done is verifiable later on.  The merchant can later send you a 1 satoshi message with your tracking number.

During the crash and lockup of MtGox, I thought the ship would surely go down so I could snatch up some cheap coins.  What did I do?  I sold at $72.  I held strong as the price rose to over $100 and watched it fall to $55, live on my computer.  *Everything is going as planned* I thought.  Then it began to rise.  And rise.  Until eventually, it hit $110, where I could stand it no more, and I rebought in, losing a significant amount of coins.  And here we sit, back down again to $95.

I went to youtube and searched "big bang theory".  The first result was this...   Here's some highlights...
3 minutes in and I'm watching 2 *men* swim in a ball pit, one popping his head up and saying "Bazinga".  The guy with glasses doesn't leap after him, he waits for the Sheldon to dive under again, in a never ending game of hard to get.
5 and a half minutes in, the men are wearing shirts covered in glitter.
7 minutes in, an effeminate man comes into an apartment wearing an Aquaman costume, complete with pink seahorse.  30 seconds later, a woman punches (more like a push) Batman in the arm.  He reacts as though she stabbed him with a pocket knife.
10 minutes in, Sheldon whimpers out, "Oh lord my belly."  The drama over a fart borders on lunacy, and the manner in which he deals with it reminds me more of a pregnant woman than a man with gas.
11:20 - Sheldon shows of his cat, "Zazzy."  This is said of course, with a lisp.  12:45, he does it again.
I think anyone who watches this link will agree with me, that if this is at all representative of the show, it is dripping with homosexual overtones.  This goes beyond a show merely featuring characters that are less than super masculine like Frasier and Niles; this is making a show where nearly every character (that I've ever man unfortunately enough to witness) is a clone of Cam from Modern Family and every scene revolves around a competition to see who can act less masculine than the other.  And to top it off, during the entire 13 minute video of Sheldon's *best moments*, there's not a laugh to be found that I'm aware of, and absent a laugh track, I'm certain the straight fans of this show would be utterly confused.

I'm not saying that Bitcoin can go exponential in terms of value forever, but it can go exponential in terms of dollars forever, depending on the creation of dollars.  My main point is that we need to stop thinking about it as a stock and start thinking about it as a new technology.

Think of it like this...  There are 10 people doing bitcoin.  They all agree on certain rules.  These are the rules.
1 - Starting with a phrase, a hash will be made.  A hash is an irreversible function.  Example - the word "rollercoaster" will hash to 586fc97a344b20db2e0bd5204a6f11a3042a6ba60cc4847f39922c7ee78bc889.  Anyone can check this out.  Let's call it block 0.
2 - Working in blocks, there is information that will be hashed into the next block.  Each block must contain certain information, for our purposes, we'll say it contains the number of the previous block, all the transactions the node has included, the block reward, the hash of the previous block, nonce (little counter), hash of this block (winning hash).
3 - For the first block, the reward is 10, and the reward halves every 100 blocks.
4 - The winning hash must have a first digit less than 5.
5 - The block format will be ...
t=blockfinder gets 10
t=blockfinder to ? 10
Now we can run the network.
We have the prior block at 0, so the block while you're looking for the winning hash might look something like this...
t=blockfinder gets 10
t=blockfinder to alice 10
But now if you hash this, you end up with 53e87831d4017f85594beead0c5a6969dbfc4a5ac89837b753cbd651ed412879.  this is not a winning hash ... and you know why?  If you tell the other 9 participants that it is, they'll reject it because the winning hash must have a starting digit less than 5.  Now what do you do?  Well, it is a race, so you very quick try different nonces.  Go up to nonce 4 and the winning hash is 34c4249326e115f32c34019e0db3569de9cd55676c8856f4398dc477e5e25ecd.  Now you're the WINNER with the name alice!  And you publish this for all the world to see...
t=blockfinder gets 10
t=blockfinder to alice 10
And now everyone begins the race for block  hoping to collect their reward plus transaction fees.  And on it goes, with the miners (the ones collecting transaction data and trying out nonces to get to the next block) getting rewarded.  And what happens if they cheat, saying that they will collect more reward than they're entitled, or publishing a transaction that isn't legit?  Well, the other 9 miners will look at their own ledgers and hashes and reject the cheater.  In this way, everyone has an incentive to keep everything legit.  The miners serve this purpose by racing to find the winning hash, and now the race is so powerful, it would be very difficult for a cheater to fool a majority of the miners.

This is what makes games fun.  You see a hash that is 0783bc7e0ea68a4bf3e4f23dd6792c134f304357c41ea9ab099422965a24cff3 and you don't know what it says.
Then after you bet, the source of the hash is revealed.

The problem is that you sent the transaction with a fee of .0001, rather than .0005.
This has led to the delay, as stated on the SatoshiDice website... "MAKING SURE BETS ARE RETURNED QUICKLY
SatoshiDICE attempts to calculate your Bitcoin bet and return it within 30 seconds. However, due to a number of variables, there is sometimes a delay. The best way for you to ensure your Bitcoin bet is returned to you quickly, is for you to include the standard fee of .0005btc in your payment transaction. This helps it get noticed by the network faster, and SatoshiDICE picks it up, calculates it, and returns it to you faster. Sometimes, this fee issue can mean the difference between your bet being returned within a minute vs. hours."

I can foresee the 1 mil + figure as being totally doable in 10 years or so.  What people tend to forget is that even if you go ahead and make all your calculations on 21 million bitcoins, that doesn't mean there are 21 million in regular circulation.  The number will be much, much lower, especially as large institutions start to hold BTC as a hedge on the dollar, gold, etc...  Bitcoin will be like gold is now, with a huge quantity held in reserve, and a smaller portion being used for transactional purposes by everyday folk.

Print them each a paper wallet with .1 BTC on it and give it to them as a gift.  Tell them that you'll buy them back from them for $13 each ... or they can simply keep them and ask you periodically how much they would be worth on the open market.
They'll put it in their wallet and then they'll forget about it.
In a month, you give them a little update.  "Hey mom, that piece of paper is now worth 17 dollars."
They'll still think its a joke.
A few months later... "Hey dad... do you still have that thing I printed you?  You do?  It's worth 25 dollars now.  Just so you know."  It will still be a joke.
But sooner or later, they'll try to call bullshit on you.  And then you'll sign them up for a Coinbase account and transfer the funds for them, resulting in a deposit on their account of $73.  Eventually, everyone hops on board.

Well, what about a local escrow service in each city?  Like is someone is in San Antonio and they want to trade out Bitcoins for something, they could come to see me and I'll do it right in front of them...
"OK, seller, hand over the goods.  OK, buyer, hand over the money.  My fee is 5%, is this OK with both of you?  Which of you will be first to leave?  Please sign here...  Thank you.  Buyer, here are your goods.  You are free to leave.  For security reasons, I'll be holding seller's money for 10 minutes while you leave... wouldn't want seller to chase you down and rob you... right?
OK, seller, here are you funds.  Have a nice day!"
3-4 trusted escrow services in the top 20 major cities would do wonders for the community.  How many people were spooked by that story of the kid with the headphones?  Imagine dealing with large items.

I might be missing something, but I agree.  That way, the 3rd party bank (need their sig to spend) can simply go away and you may still spend your funds.  Just bury the 3rd key or put it in a safety deposit box or something; put it in a place appropriate for one time use.

I'm of the mind that there ought to only be 2, the Bitcoin and the Satoshi.  There's no need for anything else.  Honestly, there's no need for anything other than Satoshi, and everyone who has 1BTC simply has 100 million Satoshis.
In the future, people dealing in BTC will simply have high amounts of Satoshis, just like when Mexico was dealing with Peso's in the early 90's.  No big deal.  How much for that hot dog?  1,700 Satoshis?  OK.

You're not understanding Bitcoin - once it is sent, it is sent, regardless of what Bitstamp and this other exchange tells you.  Unless you see it on blockchain, just assume it was never sent.  Even if it was sent without a transaction fee, which is a bad practice, it would still show on blockchain, but simply be labeled unconfirmed.

Maybe.  I wonder what the incentive will be to run p2p nodes when you're not collecting transaction fees.  The ability of the off chain bank to tax all transactions, like .1 cent's worth per transfer seems a compelling reason to run one.  What reason will there be for a p2p node?

Bitcoin as an investment is the scariest of all possible investments.  Scarier than gold, silver, pink sheets, etc...  After the crash from $260 to $100, if you're still in it, you're not the kind of person who cries about it going down to $75.

It is annoying because if the site is only storing hashes of passwords, then a strong password should be safe even if the site is infiltrated.  Now, even though the passwords were apparently hashed, we're not only assuming that they have the hashes (useless with strong passwords), we're also assuming they have the password itself.
So if those are the assumptions that are going to be made every time someone makes any kind of penetration ... what's the point of hashing them in the first place?

This is something that I've been meaning to ask.  Do you merely need to have a certain number of leading zeroes, or does your entire hash need to fall below a particular value.  Let's say that the hash* will be 10 digits long and contain only numbers.
Let's say that difficulty 1 means the winning hash needs to be less than 0999999999.  This means that the winning hash might be 0111111111, or 0999999998.  Doesn't matter.  However, is it not an error to simply say that the winning hash must contain 1 leading zero?
I ask because suppose that difficulty 25 requires a winning has to be less than 0555555555.  Now if your nonce makes your hash 0999999998, you've got the 1 leading zero... but your hash is still greater than the target hash.  If leading zeroes are the only concern, there are only 64 potential difficulties available.

I'm thinking more in terms of 1 BTC being $500,000 to $1,000,000 in that time frame.  Or it will be worth 0.  I don't see there being much of a middle ground.  BTC either takes off or dies; right now the BTC plane is just warming up its engines.
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:34:42
You're making the assumption that sellers may sell in any quantity at the last price.  Suppose it trades at $100 and I put in a million dollars worth.  Common thinking tells you that I'll be able to buy 10,000.  Nope... unless there are 10,000 to buy at that price.
More likely, and what you're seeing, is I put in my million, my purchase raises the last trade price to $110.  Now I don't have 10,000, I have 9,000, because as the price rose, I could buy less an less.
Now you want to make the assumption that I'll be able to sell all 9,000 at $110 each...  Nope.  I'll need to wait for people to bid that much first, which might not happen at all, let alone immediately after I make my purchase.

But everything is such a stretch.


I already addressed this.  He waits until Sheldon dives under the balls again before going after him.  He's trying to arbitrarily extend the chase because a man chasing a man in a ball pit is considered compelling drama.  Had they stripped down to their underwear in a bubble party it wouldn't be any more gay.


Bromance?  No.  Jerry and George are a bromance.  These two guys, if they were real people, would be in an obvious and open relationship, not that there's anything wrong with that.  If you're trying to tell me that they're not in a relationship on the show (I don't know because I don't follow it), that only strengthens my point.


Weakling?  No, he's just super excited to show how weakness, because strength is seen as a masculine thing.  Did he spend the rest of the episode with an injured arm?  I'll guess that he didn't.  It allows his character to be anti-masculine without requiring the writers to have the necessary talent to incorporate it into the rest of the episode.
I could go on and on, but I'll just stop here.  Which seems more likely, that these males act like almost no one from planet Earth who is straight, appealing to .0001% of the American audience... or... THEY'RE GAY.
Also, the actor who plays Sheldon recently came out as gay.  Like there is a single person who didn't pick up on that the the moment he opened his mouth on the show...
