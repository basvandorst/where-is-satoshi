What's crazy is that this was all hypothetical the year I graduated from HS.

When I was in the Caymans the tour guide said there was $2T on deposit there. I’m sure that was all for legitimate purposes.

Doesn't look like you missed 4/20.
@_date: 2019-11-05 14:09:19
Wow, I've never smoked weed and I at least know 4/20.  Have you ever been outside a library?  :D

Send me 2 bitcoin and I’ll tell you for sure.

Regardless, even if it was just for drug sales the dude knowingly setup a marketplace to sell drugs globally.  Did you not think he'd end up in jail for that?  
@_date: 2019-02-13 18:36:51
I certainly don't agree with the drug war and I certainly think prohibition has failed with many things in history (alcohol, drugs, etc) but the guy knew what he was doing, knew he was violating the law and did it on a large and systemic basis.  So he's in jail now, sucks to be him.  If it was up to me all drugs would be legal, regulated for safety and taxed just like alcohol. 
And let's not forget Silk Road went well beyond just drugs.  Fake passports, passwords, weapons, hitmen (though I'm sure most/all of those were either a scam or cops), credit card numbers, stolen identities, etc. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:18:04
Exactly. I class it the same as the guy selling drugs on the corner.  He knows he's doing something against the current laws, he knows he can make a lot of money doing it and he's accepted the risk. Silk Road wasn't directly selling drugs themselves but they were helping the buyers and sellers meet to make a deal which has been proven many times in court to be more than enough to lock someone up.    
I think of it like Craigslist.  Guy sets up a site for people to sell stuff.  People sell loads of legal stuff on there like lawnmowers and cars.  But occasionally they might sell prostitution services.  It wasn't setup purely for hookers.  Silk Road was setup TO SELL DRUGS.  It's all about intent and that goes a long way when someone gets into a court room.

Good rule of thumb is this.  If you have to ask "is this a scam" you can generally guess that it is.  99% of the time you'd be right.  If you think it's fake go straight to the source and check if there's a newer version to download.  You did check, there's no version 4.0.0 so you've already answered your own question.

Going to jail for drugs is dumb in general.  However, it's still illegal and when you add up all the aggregate charges guess what....that's a long time in jail.  
@_date: 2019-02-13 17:52:54
Why?  There are lots of legitimate cases that deserve clemency review long before someone who ran a site that was a clearinghouse for massive amounts of crime.  Maybe let's review the old lady that is in jail for 30 years for selling a tiny bit of pot to pay her rent before we get around to this guy.  
Also, what the fuck does this have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-02-05 01:39:50
Sure, stand by. 
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:38:26
The law is the law.  If you break the law, you go to jail.  That's just how it works.  
I am pro-legalization, I am anti-drug war, etc and will continue to be that way.  But for now while the law is that these actions are illegal it's FUCKING STUPID to be involved in enabling drug trades via an open internet site.  
@_date: 2019-02-13 19:07:16
You're obviously missing the point that this guy was involved in long term systemically enabling crime.  Guy got locked up for legitimate reasons.  Sorry, not sorry.
CIA agents going to jail for drug running, lol.  We'll never see that happen.  
Verizon isn't providing cellular service for the purposes of crime, crime just happens on their service.  Just like Ford isn't responsible for drunk driving. Stop being dumb.

I buy hamburgers with US dollars.  If I had a sub that discussed US dollars would it be appropriate to post an article about hamburgers just because I buy them with USD?  Of course not.  That's why this being posted here is somewhat silly.

Shit if you pronounced that in Brazilian Portuguese (specifically someone from the Rio area) you might actually have gotten pretty close.

Won't even cover the retainer. I know lawyers that do less public criminal cases than this that have $50k retainers (higher in plenty of cases).

You'd think a rich guy in charge of a large national budget would know a little bit more about how money works.

Best advice, don’t download shit that’s been sent to you unsolicited.
