Just need to get my wallet addresses from an old wallet
@_date: 2017-09-18 02:05:51
Have a look on YouTube, the vertcoin website also has a good walk through 
@_date: 2017-09-25 10:43:32
Rumours are bouncing around, wonder if they create an exchange that would be cool. 
@_date: 2017-09-14 21:08:53
Charlie Lee is a trusted guy, litecoin should be king!
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:19:28
Whats the problem up and coming, no exchanges?
@_date: 2017-09-14 19:12:55
Could there be any more damaging news? This has to be the worst?

I thought they wont be able to trade, at least majority of exchanges 
@_date: 2017-09-20 02:44:11
Where's the movement its moving like hold
@_date: 2017-09-27 09:01:48
Still great!
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:34:32
All bitcoin and alts at least the top 100 will grow big tine by December this year. All this ban stuff on the news is huge promotion

Exactly financial advisors have basic understanding but more understanding than their clients so it makes it ok lol
@_date: 2017-09-05 02:33:43
Its only ICO not a ban on cryptocurrency, just banning shitcoin ICOs from taking advantage of people
@_date: 2017-09-11 00:33:33
Very good points, they are expanding not only their bitcoin mining but also ether, this is actually the biggest in the world. My opinion you guys might think otherwise is that all the commotion has to do with ridiculous ICOs that are just there to pump and dump, regulation of these ICOs will allow for better quality investment, thus bigger and brighter future

ATMs ate being pushed out across the globe, mobile payments for merchants and online payment systems coming! This is most likely the reason for do much condemnation

Are we starting to see acceptance?

Why wont my encrypted wallet.dat file load, it rescanned for 3 hours
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:16:36
@_date: 2017-09-10 21:45:40
No, I have been reading online it was fake news. Unless the news about the fake news was actually fake news
@_date: 2017-09-15 21:07:12
There will be someone to buy the mined coins lol and only 23% of trade volume is from China. All the major ups and downs in price have come from when the US wakes up until they go to sleep
@_date: 2017-09-19 10:38:14
Good move!
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:17:14
Figure them out?
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:34:40
Just use coinspot
@_date: 2017-09-09 21:34:15
Nobody can ban bitcoin or alt currencies, they can regulate the currency but that just makes the existing currencies more popular 
@_date: 2017-10-09 21:12:00
Could it be the hard drive making the sync slow?
@_date: 2017-10-16 23:56:17
I have a 4-5 year old wallet.dat from bitcoin-qt, was storing this for the long term and have found out that qt is not supported. I am wanting get access to my coins by unable to load then in to bitcoin core wallet. How can there be no option in bitcoin core to load qt wallets, have tried upgrade features in the console but nothing
@_date: 2017-10-17 01:32:45
No error just loads as normal but doesn't show any coins and not encrypted, this is a common issue I have seen for other bitcoin-qt wallets.dats
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:38:24
Have an i7 3ghz 8mb RAM and decent net connection, went to 50% quickly then started taking a long time
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:51:25
Thats for bitcoin core the wallet was from the previous bitcoin-qt
@_date: 2017-09-24 22:20:11
To me this is just the dip before the new beginning, lets see how the price fairs over October 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:01:28
How low could it go
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:01:33

@_date: 2017-10-09 06:12:23

@_date: 2017-09-10 04:41:59
What do you mean big one?
@_date: 2017-10-16 11:26:50

@_date: 2017-10-16 11:25:06
Dump wallet doesnt work
@_date: 2017-10-09 05:19:33
