Such amaze! Very Jeff!

Congratulations to the whole team.  What is most impressive is the project is progressing at a  lightning speed compared to other options out there.

Possibly. If it is a pump and dump, then it is going to be one of the biggest ones in history.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:06:22
They did.  See you on day 2.

Ethereum just forked Counterparty back into an Ethereum contract.

Here is your consensus mechanism.

Counterparty smart contracts does not working! Is in testNET, not production.  If working, not scalable.... HUGE difference!

Hey Bruce, thanks for putting this together.  Event planning is mostly a thankless job.

You just made an argument on why the the US dollar should remain the reserve currency.
@_date: 2016-03-03 20:40:36
This is good for Bitcoin!

If it was, then they are succeeding.

All of this infighting is causing flight into the other coin.

Title should be named "[META] On ~~hardforking~~ *mentioning Ethereum*: If Bitcoin is so vulnerable to reddit posts and a man who codes in the open, that it requires censorship to stay safe, perhaps it is destined for doom after all."
@_date: 2015-08-10 18:58:36
What's with the censorship?
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:01:22


Well that turned out to be a mistake...

It does not get banned unless someone reports it. I have reported this post as being off topic. I am confident that the post will be removed as the rules on r/bitcoin are enforced with an equal and consistent standard.

I suspect that their entire database including 2FA reset keys was compromised in March 2014 where customers received invoice.jar attachments in their email.   Many customers lost funds.  The line about "Even with this latest development, we are proud to say that we have never lost customer funds." is utter bullshit.  They (Joseph David) also scammed investors, see

Thanks for the update, Jeff.  Just a suggestion, you may want to post an update to the KryptoKit Twitter.

That is what the entire ETH community did with ETC at first. Dumped it to $0.60.  ETC us now worth $13.

It is not a .pdf. It is a .jar file. The .jar file delivers a Remote Access Trojen (RAT) virus to your computer for the purpose of stealing bitcoins.  It allows the attacker to control, keyboard log and surveil your computer remotely.  The email was made to look like it came from backup  Examining the email header, it actually came from zsstar  
This is due to a Cavirtex leek if all of their customers database email addresses in March 2014. They say it is a 3rd party's fault but that is a load of BS. Customers have been receiving .jar virus attachments since March 2014. Customers *have* lost significant bitcoin due to this.  RIP Cavirtex.
