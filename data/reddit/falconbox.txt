I don't understand anything of what you just said :/
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:43:20
But don't you only pay tax once you sell it from an exchange?  
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:19:25


Wouldn't that make sense though?  Coinbase announcing it is now trading BCH leads to a surge in BCH.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:31:03
What do you mean 0.1?  You mean 1/10th of a bitcoin for 17k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:17:33
Gotcha.  So because you received BCH at the time of the fork (essentially you just got it out of thin air), they are considering that as taxable income.  And then any gains on that is capital gains.
For example, I had a small amount of bitcoin in Coinbase.  It only amounted to about $50.  Today I just received an equal amount in BCH, totaling $8.  That $8 essentially came to me from nowhere, so that would be the taxable income (I know, it's a nothing amount.  But if that were larger, then it would come into play in my taxes.)

I'm somewhat new and confused.  ELI5.  
What is Bitcoin Cash, what's wrong with it, and what did Coinbase apparently do wrong?
I've had a Coinbase account for years from a purchase I made in 2015, but have never used it since.  I only have like $50 in bitcoin leftover from that purchase (it was $1, but has grown since BTC exploded).
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:21:59
But this article kind of says something different:


In your gold example, if someone gave you 15k in gold and you sold it for currency, that would be 15k "other income", not capital gains as you said in your example.  Capital gains is reserved for *gains* from the time you received it to the time you sold it (ie:  If you held that gold for several months then sold when it was at $20k, you'd report $5k in capital gains).
You'd report the initial gift of $15k in gold as Other Income, plus $5k in capital gains.

What makes them sketchy compared to other coins?
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:51:33
I've never been to What's wrong with that subreddit?
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:23:19
What is SegWit?  I keep hearing it mentioned.
Give me a very very simple ELI5 answer, since I don't know much about crypto.
@_date: 2015-12-09 08:44:20
I have nothing to hide, but can't "go for it".  I can't get past the address screen since I'm in the US.  Oh well.
And of course, one of the other sites someone linked does work in the US, but not my state.   
@_date: 2015-12-09 07:21:27
I'm in the US and just want a virtual card, yet it still asks for my address for verification (even though I don't want a physical card shipped).  Any way around that?
@_date: 2018-05-04 16:57:25
No idea how to do that.  I'm new to all this.
@_date: 2014-04-05 06:10:58
OMG, why doesn't my local Pizza Hut accept Bitcoin?!  WTF!
Seriously dude, get a credit card or something.

This man knew the laws, and he decided to break them.  He deserves what he got.

Are computers that energy inefficient?  Or would you need like 10 rigs running 24/7?
@_date: 2017-01-07 02:09:37
So now the people with enough money to house these massive pools are the ones getting the bitcoins.
So just like everything else, the rich get richer.
@_date: 2017-08-12 16:49:16
Damn, I should buy some Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:26:17
So when I go to that site and hover over parts of the graph, it's like you said.  The left side says, for example near the middle, "Can be sold: 30btc for 300,000 USD" and the right side says "can be bought:...."
What exactly is that?  People have 30btc to actually sell?
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:23:52
So you're saying I should buy some...
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:04:44
Reminds me why I got into accounting rather than finance.  I hate this stock stuff.
Also funny that people have orders in to buy it at $200.  If it ever dropped down that low again, I'd imagine people would be hounding to get in at such a low price again.
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:57:04
Got it, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-26 05:22:43
It's 2017 grandpa, we all eat ass now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:50:56
12.4 now.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:49:12
ELI5 what I'm looking at?  Why the huge jump at 10,000?
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:47:54
lol, that makes me feel better about my disposable income.  I was thinking "damn, I would love to have $5k to buy 2 btc a few weeks ago."
As it stands, I'd get a fraction of a fraction, small enough where these jumps wouldn't amount to much profit for me. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:18:03
There's @_date: 2018-02-01 07:11:57
What's wrong with graphs?
@_date: 2018-02-24 10:17:04
That's why you render it as an mp4 video and just upload it to a site like Streamable instead.
A 3 minute + long gif is insane (yes, I know imgur and gfycat convert them to video files anyways, but it saves you the hassle of the super long render).
@_date: 2018-02-03 09:46:40
Same here, kind of.  Wanted to buy LTC at $360 through CoinBase, but my bank denied it for some reason because they thought it was suspicious.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:11:10
it is pretty funny watching the neckbeards freak out though.  Keep investing in your made up online Monopoly money while the rest of us earn real money.
