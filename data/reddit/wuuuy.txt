No, no, no, no. The blockchain is still immutable. The Bitcoin rules as first proposed are not changed. The 1mb restriction was a temporary measure to prevent spam. We know this. I personally think that we should tread carefully when upping the block size, but it will have to be increased at some point of the future, sidechains won't be any good if it doesn't. 
I would prefer to see a kick the can down the road approach, where we first got segwit to take care of some transactions, and *then* increased the block size, but we've come to a point where there is more support for bigger blocks than for segwit. 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:06:45
A POW change would be way worse in terms of changing Bitcoin consensus. I'm all for segwit *before* a block size increase (due to sidechains), but I'm calling bullshit on your argument. Consenus is majority, so if a majority blocks segwit and/or switches to another client, then **that** is the defacto client that makes up Bitcoin. 
I really hope Core rethinks a block size increase if it comes to that, as to appease big blockers, because they have some really talented people, and I think the best of intentions.

No, we can't know that. There's no way of telling what the majority of the economy wants. You can tell what the miners want and you can tell what users running nodes want, but don't try to say that the majority want segwit, because we don't know what they want. They might not even care for all we know. I'm a segwit supporter, but I'm not gonna pretend to be on a majority side when it's unknown where the majority stands.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:27:43
How are big blockers *terrorists*?
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:07:33
While I have been a supporter of Core, but willing to accept a move to BU if that would happen until recently (I wouldn't follow to their chain anymore), I also expect what you are saying. 
Many if not most ("casual") users will likely follow to the chain with the shortest confirmation times or where their coins are valued higher. And that chain **will** be Bitcoin, by definition. It's just a scarier Bitcoin where large miners' control grow even more and with a development team that have proven themselves to be unsuitable for the task of having control of a major client.

No trade fees == Fake volume
That's why China has a smaller impact on BTC after the introduction of trading fees after the PBOC meeting with the Chinese exchanges.

I'm not super excited about Lightning tbh. I'm excited about bringing altcoin functionality to Bitcoin through sidechains. I'm excited about Bitcoin being the layer that sidechains communicate through and transfer value through and all the yet to be invented innovations that this will bring. Electrum has a pretty cool idea, but we can't do chain-to-chain transfers, which means we need to trust exchanges. Lightning will be nice, but it's nowhere near what I expect developers to innovate in the future.

I completely agree with this. There's gonna be a need for larger blocks later on, even with SegWit, so add a 2MB block size increase to avoid going to BU and SegWit being "blocked". Then we can finally get the cool sidechain applications (LN, Etehereum-like Rootstock, Anonymous transactions and many other cool things not even thought about yet) that I've been looking forward to for so long.
@_date: 2017-03-14 10:22:39
Wouldn't Core *contributor* be good for people who have made contributions to Core (even if it's just one or two small changes), and Core *developer* be a good term for those actively contributing?
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:40:21
That's still not a compromise though. SegWit was already planned and in the works when this discussion started becoming serious, so it was never a compromise. I support SegWit, but I'm not going to pretend that it's any kind of compromise. 
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:54:56
We're gonna need a block size increase some time in the future in order to accommodate sidechains anyhow, I wish Core would do it now (together with SegWt) just so we can get this fight over with, heal the community, and finally get some cool sidechain action going.

Good bot!
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:34:02
The issue is that they're not telling users that it's the 2x "upgrade", but only saying that it's the "segwit upgrade". This is misleading as it follows that the only difference here would be the segwit part.

Cash is king in Japan. This will have a minimal impact, and most likely only affect people already holding bitcoins. It's great for recognition, but don't expect it to increase users.

I just wrote a lengthy response with some questions to you, but after opening up the white paper again since it was released, I realize I need to do some more reading on how the actual routing of payments work in LN. :)
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:36:27
Not really though. The scenario I was describing was for those that wish to use a more centralized service. You'd still have the option to setup a payment channel directly to the party you wish to pay. And it would probably be more beneficial to do so for services that you'll be paying often to, but maybe not for services that you only want to make a few micro transactions with. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 07:41:48
Solid TA!
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:18:06
You dropped this: 
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:53:52
You'll still pay the on-chain fee for settling. But one transaction fee is much smaller than 100 transaction fees.
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:52:01
I expect Bitcoin's sidechains to overtake the use cases that Ethereum aims to cater. That doesn't mean I think there won't be alts that might have a small userbase, bu I think that the immutability of the Bitcoin blockchain will play a bigger role than the chain that is hardforking when you don't write a contract right (which you might be able to do on the sidechain, but not on the backbone that will be the Bitcoin blockchain).
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:29:27
Not at all. We could just switch to algorithms that are quantum computing proof (which is what I mean't when I said "in the future", maybe I should have clarified that better), though it would still require all existing users to transfer their values to new addresses to ensure they are not compromised.
@_date: 2017-05-13 14:08:01
Yeah, I wrote that unlikely would be close to impossible in a previous edit, but I wanted to be clear that there is a probability, especially if the crypto gets broken sometime in the future. But yes, it's practically impossible.
@_date: 2017-05-13 15:08:02
Yeah, informed me about how the LN is supposed to be able to route the transactions itself. I had actually missed out on that, and it only makes LN even more exciting to me! :)
@_date: 2017-05-06 09:07:19
Wow, I had completely missed out on ZKCP. It's brilliant, and it just makes so much sense to verify what you purchase like that. You get a lot of extra smart contract functionality, yet with minimal stress on the blockchain. Amazing stuff!
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:08:25
Wouldn't you be able to have like a middleman that you could open up a channel with? 
Say one hub that has a lot of payment channels up with different parties. As long as that hub have many users opening their channels to them, and many partners that they work with (Starbucks, NY Times and similar small (and even smaller) purchase partners), couldn't your transaction fee costs be greatly diminished? 
Ie. You pay the hub for all your micro-transactions, in one channel, with the partners with which you are buying access to news articles, coffees etc., and the hub has channels open with all those partners and pass along the transaction amount, taking small fee but still cheaper than what you would pay by closing the channel to the partners directly.
It would require a certain level of trust in the payment hub you connect to, but that could be a reasonable trade-off for some types of micro-transactions.

What? You didn't contradict who just said that OP can use it in whatever way they want. If OP wants to use it as a store of value and want fiat, then they can absolutely do so. If OP doesn't care about online payments, then they don't have to. There's nothing wrong with that, there are plenty of other users (myself included) who enjoy Bitcoin for the ideas it represent besides a store of value. You can buy a collector's item because you really like the item, or because you think it will appreciate in monetary value over time to sell it later. Doesn't make either party's reasons more wrong or right than the others.

It's not that no one could control the private key to it, it's just that considering how hard it is to brute force generate a private key for a specific address, it's extremely unlikely that anyone will be able to get a hold of the private key belonging to that address with current technology. So that address is often referred to as the Bitcoin-Eater, an address where coins can be dumped to be considered lost/gone/inaccessible.
@_date: 2017-05-17 08:15:28
Yep. But that's the point. If you want to make them inaccessible you can send them to that (or a smilar) address. 
@_date: 2017-06-08 19:23:31
Tweet them. Took them less than a day after I tweeted them. 
@_date: 2017-05-13 13:11:36
Nah, it's just been discussed to death before. The overall feeling is that the price would tank, though I personally believe that it would be a good thing to either have those coins re-distributed (Satoshi selling) or sent to the Bitcoin-eater address to ensure such a thing can't happen.
