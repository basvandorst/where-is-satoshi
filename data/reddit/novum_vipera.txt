Interestingly there's still some confusion here in Blighty over the tax status of crypto gains.

Welcome to day trading

Yes, at your desk. Into a jar.

Nope, Brit here. 
mifid II confused the shit out of me for a brief moment though - I feel sorry for the folks over on the continent losing access to contracts without document translations (i.e if you're French you can't trade an etf that doesn't have a full French translation of all it's documentation).

Because the underlying principle of the stock market is "give me some money for a bit of my business, and if we do well you'll get dividends and a bump in the alpha which means you can then sell your bit of my company for profit."
Insider trading is taking an investors money and going "lol, suckers, we'll sell before the bad news and leave our investors fucked (or buy before the good news and lock everyone out of that opportunity too)" - it's a breach of the moral contract between a business and it's shareholders (and coincidentally the legal one). 
If it were allowed, no one would want to invest in listed companies and market liquidity would dry up faster than a Californian dam. 
Edit: FX isn't quite so clear cut though, since insider trading would technically refer to a central Bank (hmmmm) but certainly exchanges could be accused of insider type fraud if they're front-running trades.

Just stop there, OP. That's the perfect answer. Good work.

When GTA moves from satire to documentary, shit has officially gotten out of hand.

And surprise surprise, the year old story about Trump is pushing this down and off the front-page.
I suppose it doesn't matter that it's a primitive tactic if it works.

Perhaps users of both operating systems and OS architectures stopped using that terminology when George W was still your president. This so cringe-worthy I'm tempted to share it with hailcorporate.

Since punch cards were being used we knew this was going on  - it just used to involve printing a ream of data after everyone had gone home. Now they can sit in Langley in their slippers doing the same thing.

As a Scotsman first and foremost, I'm just going to sit back and have dram while all this sorts itself out.
Hmm, finally stop lurking in Bitcoin and I post about whisky...

I'm curious, you guys are all reacting to the fee but what's a good average fee these days? Whenever I transfer coins from cex to my wallet I paid about .001
@_date: 2018-06-02 10:14:24
Alright I'll ask - what's the red/green indicator you have following the price action? High/Low or something else?

That looks exactly like how I imagine HK being. I can almost hear the buzz of the neon.

Alright Trotsky, what would you classify Venezuela as then? This ought to be good.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:41:48
Well a) that's not the same as the situation in Venezuela by a long, capital controlling long shot, and b) glad I don't live in either country.

Yeah but deregulate the sand market and pretty soon no one can afford any sand and even people who don't need sand are somehow losing money thanks to it.

Protection of private property is one of the cornerstones of western democracy and one of the fundamental reasons for the west's global dominance since the earliest days of market economics. It's why the UK and USA were the driving force behind global economic expansion for much of our modem (post agrarian) history.
Even if these people are trying to stymy crypto etc, they're undermining their own safety and success in the process. Indeed this goes beyond assets and into the nature of one's society. This is a problem for everyone.

What's the psychological barrier here? $3k? $3.5k? That's where profit taking will hit in a big way and has the potential to end the current trend. 
Edit: why the downvotes? Btc is still a short term commodity for most investors so a take profit drop makes sense
