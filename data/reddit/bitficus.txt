You're right. I totally had the wrong attitude. I'm obviously biased to the character. But I understand that there are many arguments against it as well. Thanks for your feed back and open discourse.

Miners are still incentivized to mine new blocks. The idea is you can create a transaction with a hash of some arbitrary data into a block. Fees will incentivize miners to include data in the block.

If you've ever been to Japan, you'll notice this symbol is literally everywhere. It would be the equivalent of using "the" as the satoshi symbol.

$ is used in US, Canada, Mexico, Australia... the "$" symbolizes money. The ○ designates its internet native.

Lightning is not bitcoin. Lightning Network is a scaling solution on top of bitcoin. If lightning had a horrific failure today, bitcoin would still function. We can't use the lightning bolt from a tech that's only been around for 1 year.

2 points:
1-All the physical infastructure is an extremely valuable recourse. Markets will force ISPs to change their business model to protect those resources. 
2- the idea of a mesh network is that there's no central source of internet service provider. Currently, we all rely heavily on cell towers and fiber hookups. But in a mesh network, we all manage our own node and connect through each other. If a cell tower goes down, you're in out of service. If a node goes down, you just connect to another one nearby.

You could charge a fee for using your node. If you're a good hub with solid connectivity and reliability,  then your node would earn money for you. You can use the fees to pay others for content and connections. So everyone would have income from fees and simultaneously pay fees to other nodes. 
I'm not an expert, but I think this is a paradigm shift in internet structure.
@_date: 2019-03-04 04:02:04
You can put the line through when writing it by hand.   I would say you can even put the line through in other fonts and styles of this symbol. There are fonts of the $ with and without the solid line.

There's an enormous community of bitcoin outside of the subreddit. Tone and CW are personalities that don't represent bitcoin as whole. I would say that many (if not most) serious bitcoiners are in it for creating an escape from the current system. For me, it matters a lot more that we build a sound decentralized monetary system for the needy. Price is just a metric.

Mining is the process of minting new bitcoin. To create new bitcoin you have to solve an algorithm which requires intense computing. Mining is electricity intensive because your computer is constantly competing against other miners to unlock new bitcoin. Essentially, bitcoin is backed by all the electricity it requires to mint and protect the network.

Zap is an open source *lightning enabled* wallet. The iOS app has been out for sometime, this is the long awaited Android Beta. In my experience, Lightning for mobile as a whole is cumbersome - NOT excluding Zap. However, Zap is considered by  many to be cutting edge when it comes to LN mobile UX.
tldr: Lighting on Andriod with "Zap" is here.

Actually bits and satoshis could coexist. I think a bit is  100 satoshis. So the example given would be 7.3 bits or 730 sats or 0.00000730 bitcoin. 
Personally, I like sats.

It's a digital fiat system that uses a distributed ledger controlled by unelected officials. In the end, it has to clear international regulatory hurdles, and is still handicapped by the underlying monetary problems of state run fiat. 
On the whole, I see it as a net positive. Also remember, Bitcoin doesn't care, or know, about Libra.
