Or, as I couldn't pay for such loans, he just dies of a broken back. Not to mention good economic externalities when you have more educated people in your society, or the fact that many poor people have shit social mobility under the loan system due to the fact that their immediate income is too low to pay the interest and they are considered a risky loan. Then they can't get a good job and are stuck in a vicious cycle of poverty. There is a reason countries with socialised education have better GINI scores.

Americans have high taxes actually. Max income tax in Brazil is 27.5%. In the US, 39.6%. Inheritance tax in Brazil= 4%. In the US= 40% at 1M US$ and over. 
The if the US military budget was half its size (Still the largest by a mile) US people would actually pay less. Or have universal healthcare/subsidised universities.

43, not that it has anything to do with taxes, it has more to do with the countries institutions and market structure. Heavy taxing Sweden, Norway, Switzerland and Lebanon have more billionaires per-capita that the supposedly low taxing US. AB InBev owner, JP Lemann, is Brazilian. He also owns Kraft foods, Heinz and Burger King. 
Also, Federal Estate tax is 40% for individuals with a Estate that sums over 1M USD. (Tentative tax). What happens is that you get tax credits that reduce the effective tax rate, but still, you're being taxed at 40% and then given the money back. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:36:46
Federal Estate Tax. You can look it up, it's even on Wikipedia. What generally happens is that you get tax credits, which bring down the effective tax rate.

Keynes never said debt was good. He said debt was necessary in times of economic downturn to stimulate growth. He writes multiple times that countries should pay back the debts in times of plenty. If the economy is booming, no need for the State to make new debts. If you're gonna bring Keynes into this, at least read his body of work first. Also, Friedman's monetarist school of thought is much more appropriate for BTC.

He isn't a complete moron when it comes to business investment, but his blunders are just extreme. I'm pretty sure he just tried to manipulate the bitcoin market to have a better entry.

Zimbabwean and Venezuelan money are slowly losing their capabilities as money. I know that in Venezuela people are using USD instead of the Bolivar, not sure about Zimbabwe though. Think of 1920's Germany. The Deutsch mark had lost its ability to function as money. 
This is the beauty of Jevons (Not mine, I just used his) definition. You can see that when something that used to be money starts to fail one of the 3 criteria, it isn't too far of not being used as money anymore.

And yet, all those payments systems seem to work faster and more reliably than the Blockchain somedays. Honestly, imo, the biggest benefit of bitcoin is it being divisible into 1/1000 of itself. Something you can't do with the dollar. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:29:07
Honestly? I don't see bitcoin as a better form of money than, say, wire transfers. Right now, bitcoin's flaw far outweigh it's benefits imo. And it still has a long way to go become viable money. As I said in other comment, something like bitcoin might be the future, but I doubt it will be in this century.

Money and the Mechanism of Exchange (1875), William Jevons. University College of London, creator of the Marginal Value theory, father of math in Economics. Influenced Irving Fisher and Alfred Marshall. It's literally hard economic theory. Bitcoin isn't money and never will be in the current form. ZWD isn't accepted in most FOREX trading and is failing money, just like the Deutsch Mark after WW1. It's literally losing it's functionality as money, just like the Venezuelan Bs.F. Money only works as money while it is stable and you can used it as store of value. Bitcoin fails that requirement as it's value fluctuates enough for economic calculus to be impossible. Therefore, it isn't money. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:59:23
Yeah, no. You can walk into Cochabamba, Bolivia; Timbuktu, Mali or Jalal-Abad, Kyrgyzstan and spend US dollars. Everyone accepts it. Try doing that in Bitcoin.  Dollars are easy to trade and have stable purchasing power. Bitcoin will never be a viable currency with the current market volatility. That's not to get into the electricity/internet access requirements. Bitcoin is a nice idea, but it has more flaws than features. It might be possible in a distant future, but not in this century.

Because most people in this sub are economic illiterates that don't know the definition of money and will just have a jerk reaction to say I'm wrong without ever producing an argument because they love bitcoin and want it as a currency regardless. 
Also, I do that to show that Bitcoin isn't currency **JUST** because it's not widely accepted. It's not currency because it fails all other requirements, and to show **WHY** it can't fail the other requirements. 
In short, to be didactic.
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:07:39
Bitcoin fails in literally every function of money.
It's not accepted widely enough to be a mean of payment, it's too unstable to be a store of value and it can't be used as a unit of account. 
Until you fix all of that, it can't be used as money. 
Money literally never has an agreed upon value (Neither does any good). Some people value it more, some people value it less. That's the whole point of the subject theory of value. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 20:50:31
It will only be viable when the volatility is comparable to the US dollar. Having the dip is already a sign that it isn't viable as money. Until bitcoin has a +-3% change in the course of a whole year, it will most likely not be used as money.

Because I'm also a masochistic jerk, I guess. To be fair, idk either. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 01:46:28
Yes, it's stable in it's rate of change. Bitcoin can go either up or down 20% in the next weeks days if a minor thing changes. No money can be used when it can have 20% inflation **or** deflation in such a short period. Bitcoin manages to gather the worse effects of inflation and deflation. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:47:32
Because it fails all 3 functions of money.
1) it is not currently a viable mean of payment. Not everyone accepts it, mostly because;
2) it is not a store of value. Bitcoin is way too volatile to be used as a currency. Imagine if your dollars would lose 40% of their purchasing powe in a week... Only to regain it 2 weeks later. You can become a millionaire and then broke in a few weeks, without changing the numbers in your bank account. And because of that, Bitcoin can't be used as;
3) Unit of account. How can you price something if the value of currency itself changes? You can't price something in Bitcoin because the value of bitcoin itself changes too fast comparatively to everything else. It's a quasi-inflation rollercoaster. When bitcoin loses value, it's inflation, when it gains value, it's deflation. To make long term plans, you need a stable currency, where its value doesn't change. Imagine you own a shop. You want to invest because you think you can make 10% more money if buy whatever. However, there is also the possibility that the money sitting in your pocket will, by itself, value 30% in the same time of your investment. So you don't invest because you're afraid you will lose that potential 30% gain. It becomes impossible to make plans to the future because money won't be usable as an unit to.make the calculations of the investment. 
TL;DR: Bitcoin isn't currency because it's not even money. It can't be money until it's value becomes stable enough that it won't fluctuate more than a normal inflation rate.
