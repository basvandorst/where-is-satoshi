Well... Bitcoin was built on a theory, that it's value is backed by the computational cost to create, and validate bitcoin (as coins are created during the validation.) 
Clearly that would contradict with having a inexpensive exchange, as that would be counter to the original theory.
Exchanges change this somewhat, in that if you decide to trust the exchange they can move the money from one account to the next without paying that price.  This cannot happen if the end customer wants to poses the bitcoin to trust the technology, rather than putting all the trust in the exchange.
IMHO trusting the exchange defeats the whole purpose of bitcoin, as it centralizes and removes the use of the blockchain.  Bitcoin the algorithm is determined by popularity.  So those holding currency can just start exchanging bitcoin using new software, and the most used software wins out.  So if those holding bitcoin are OK with leaving behind it's rarity, and giving up some of it's value justification, they can change away from the rarity cost, but while coin is at a high value, why would they do that?

You have to remember people can be real assholes.  These laws are meant to make it so they can arrest people who buy up, or hold back on supplies to make them more scarce to drive up the price.  The idea is that supply is inelastic in the short run, so make sure as many supplies get sold as possible.
Not saying it improves things at all, but it might.

And I thought we wanted a currency that was used to buy and sell things.  Guess not, just something else to gamble on.

Just curious when Mt Gox happened, you would rather Japan, US courts to have stayed out?  You think the courts shutting them down, investigating, and finding 200k bitcoins was bad?  You would prefer Coinbase to be able at anytime to defraud everyone whose coins they poses, without any fear of any legal actions?

For the most part holding any currency isn't very smart. I keep my savings in a brokerage, they will automatically adjust my holdings if bills/purchases lower my bank account to low, allows minimizing the amount of currency I do hold.
Bitcoin is interesting and fun to gamble on, HODL is clearly the opposite of promoting or using it as a currency though.

Interesting!  That shows Nexus has put a lot more thought into what it takes to pull this off than gotenna.
Appears the bitcoin part of gotenna is all hype, can't find an actual detailed plan for a functional blockchain path. they appear to have a limited network in need of a mass appeal app to expand. So throw some blockchain spaghetti on the wall, and see if any sticks.

Found video of the entire interview here:
[St. Louis Fed's James Bullard talks bitcoin and the economy](
He actually only said bitcoin is not currently a threat.  He hedged more on crypto-currencies together, bitcoin alone is not.  
Bitcoin may have a role in replacing a national currency, more as a value backer to other crypto currencies;  In it's current form, bitcoin wouldn't work well as a stand alone currency at a nation level.

That reads like more a we'll do crypto company hype and pump, all theory no meat.  So not only do you need a bunch of other users to bounce through (density close to 9 per 3x3 mile areas), you have to bounce until you find a gotenna user with cell phone internet, blue-toothed to gotenna, and running the same crypto app, you will have to broadcast to find that person, and trust their app to be legit, and it will currently have to be within 4 hops to find that white elephant in the desert.
Seams like they really need to switch to having those dongles to have 3G/wifi built in, and find a way to reward people for providing a gateway for others.  Gotenna would have been interesting, when the network could be used to also send and receive text to people who don't have the hardware or gotenna app installed, and to be able to bridge your mesh with internet as well, so be able to hop from gotenna networks that were not connected via the gotenna mesh, but even when both networks are only internet connected by a single node.  But that will require master nodes, high data use...

Would you notice if a single communist country suddenly [had 75% of the mining]( would that count?  What if they had a highly regulated internet, so you know the government was fully aware?  What if they highly subsidized electricity that would be required to get to that stage?
@_date: 2018-10-15 14:10:04


Not really, not from the Government anyway.  Getting a loan, the bank cares about every penny because it affects their loan risk if you are possibly borrowing down payment money, etc. I didn't need a loan for my last home (approx $190k) the only thing they cared about was proof I had it when I made a offer, and how to get it at closing. Had it been truly cash, and made to a bank/business, the bank would have had to fill in form 8300, which does require a SSN/TIN from the person paying. The buyer doesn't have to tell anyone where the money came from, but if the IRS cannot find that money trail, you're likely to get audited.
I assume bitcoin payment would be handled as Cash, with the form 8300 for businesses. If no loans exist between the private parties, no reporting required.

Just PM me your wallet and private keys, and I promise you I will be the last persons to sell all your remaining bitcoins.

Not really illegal, they can legally ask, and under current interpretation, they do not have to give you back your phone for weeks if you don't allow then in.  Also they are allowed to "randomly" select someone for additional screening, and if they are not a US citizen, they can decide to not allow entry for no other cause.
So it may be easier to give up your right to privacy, to save the time, hassle, and costs of booking other flights...

Only if they are in a mining pool nearly as big as the pool with 1/3.  As I understand it, if a mining pool has at least 1/3 of all miners, and is 2* the size of any other pool.  They can take more than half the solutions.  They do this by not publicizing finished blocks immediately so they get a head start on the next block.  IE the blocks take on average 10 minutes to solve.  If your pool solves one in 2 minutes, but only publishes the results internally for the first 3 minutes  after solving, your pool will start working on that next block immediately.  When that block is published at the 5 minute block, your block (which is 1/3 of all miners) has had 3 extra minutes head start.  Their odds of solving the next block (which was 1/3) first is going to be at least 1/3 higher.  So now their odds of hitting the second block in a closer to 50% instead of 33%.  But if they are able to eventually delay that second published block by an additional 2 minutes (for 5 minutes total) now they have a 50% time advantage, as well as a 1/3 computing advantage.  So they should have a 2/3 odds of getting the 3rd block in a row.  with that 2/3 advantage you can get several blocks in a row, before eventually losing on one to a external miner.  But also since block chains that are the longest (don't recall how much longer they must be) they are automatically accepted.  So if you have a internal block you have been working on un-published, and someone else publishes a competing solution, if you get your solution out at the same time, and built-on faster (with your pool advantage) you will take away the competitors block.  Once a hardware owner, sees a pool that has 1/3 of the miners, but is getting 2/3 of the solutions, you would be smart to switch to that block, as your pay will be double.

Yes, your post does.  What do you think it is, a popular vote?  It can be swung by the miners, if you have no choice where to exchange you will folow where the affordable transactions happen.  Or the large holders, mostly exchanges, no money to be made if the transactions are not paid for.  HODL'ers have no say.
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:43:09
Correct, but their have been enough forks that people are following, that already we have more than 21 million bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-03-16 17:11:10
May we get what we want. May we get what we need. But may we never get what we deserve.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:51:50
Not all of the forks are, but many of them are.  They created Lite coins, bitcoin gold...  Those are spinoffs where many wallets count both together and hold both, but they are spin-offs of separately spendable coins.  I understand these are handled somewhat as separate entities, but good examples there is no "guaranteed", all is still possible as bitcoins are still in a development or experimental phase.
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:13:57


B.S.  That is a analysis of the original bitcoin math.  But the bitcoin protocol can, and has changed, there were at least 20 forks last year.    If it becomes better for the majority of miners and owners of bitcoin to allow 40 million coins, there will be a code update to allow 40 million coins to be created.

Only illegal in china, it is just being pointed out the US could (but hasn't) and do the same and destroy the value of bitcoin in the US.  Basically it would just be all banks, and payment processors would be banned from processing, or dealing with known processors.  So you could still barter with BTC directly, but only with people who didn't care about their value in USD,  people who want to collect BTC could trade them.  Since Bitcoin sucks as a prime currency, it's hard to imagine it living.  Other crypto currencies with less transaction costs, like Litecoin on the other hand, possibly would pick up the slack.
@_date: 2018-03-09 01:51:27


I mean no one person can, but if the largest holders or largest mining pools wanted to support a fork without the cap, the cap would be gone.  Arguably they have already done this by spinning off light coin, bitcoin gold...
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:12:12
Which is also why it is useless as a currency, current owners are more interested in it's "value" than in it's utility.  They push up the difficulty as it became popular pushing long delays and uping the costs to do transactions, creating opportunities for people to reverse transactions by submitting a second transaction at a higher payoff.  Reducing it's stability and increasing the difficulty of wallets, so now doing it on your own requires a PHD in bitcoin.  This all is increasing the value of exchanges to avoid the cost of transacting coins directly, thus creating more opportunities to be defrauded.
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:44:53


I think it just requires having a seperate blockchain only published to your pool.  IE when you pool solves a hash faster than normal (say 2 minutes instead of the average 10 minute time) instead of publishing immediately externally, publish first to your pool and start working on that internal blockchain.  If you can delay 3 minutes to publish the last result, you will have a 1/2 chance of getting the next block, instead of the natural 1/3 based on hash power alone.
