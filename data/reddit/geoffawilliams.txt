I wonder about the nature of the threats that caused him to flee....could be that he had some less than "upstanding" local investors (it is Cyprus) that would not be pleased to find out that he managed to blow all of their cash in about a month. (Cue the Theme from the Godfather)

The volatility of Bitcoin makes it nearly impossible to come up with an adequate Risk management model at this time.

Unless his attempt to sell all his equity was the reason
@_date: 2014-02-28 20:14:32
Unless he split the key(s)... see [Spllitng keys]( . Then neither would be able to access
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:47:07
sounds like a true banking/trading system with a real G/L (something that can be audited) needs to be implemented
@_date: 2014-04-02 18:36:12
to the Moon!!!
@_date: 2014-02-19 15:18:35
Nah, actually if they replace the ticket with a paper wallet no change at all
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:44:20
What if the private key were somehow stolen or corrupted by a virus. Then his claims would tie back to all evidence
@_date: 2014-10-29 14:43:42
Love how some one likely turning a HUGE profit on his sale is being called "defeated" ... SMH

maybe the keys will show up on Storage Wars :-)

Not MySQL!!!
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:40:15
What if they were colluding with GOX when they thought it was a smaller scale theft. When they found out how big it was, they got cold feet and ran?
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:04:37
I think that the audit should go farther that just the technical implementation. The business itself should be audited. I think that the temptation for fractional reserves is just too great out there.
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:25:23
Not trying to be a downer or anything, but right now it just looks like it would be a run-of-the mill off-shore bank account. The bank itself will not be handling BTC exchanges to currencies (lot of hurdles to clear on that one esp. obtaining and maintaing enough BTC to be liquid)
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:15:14
And that is the beauty of it... there is nothing stopping us from coming up with a better way of doing things. If I don't like the way my bank is doing things, I could change banks, but I damn sure can't make my own.
@_date: 2013-05-03 18:37:16
Pretty sure it is r/Bitcoin not r/libertarian... You don't need to be a "libertarian" to be interested in BTC
@_date: 2013-04-11 16:45:00
But why should they? Aren't they making money off of each transaction? The thing is that what is in our best interest may not be in theirs.
@_date: 2013-06-05 13:06:24
Umm... put $1 million USD equiv on a bitcoin paper wallet, how big is it? Now try to do the same with USD cash.  Which one is easier to move, which one is more noticeable? I think that the argument isn't that those things are possible, its just that it is much, much easier (except the tracking... it's easier to track BTC)
@_date: 2013-05-07 11:47:57
Americans use banks (which report to the IRS) even for cash deposits, not everyone is trying to evade taxes. They will use exchanges if they are safe enough
@_date: 2013-11-26 17:44:27
Actually fiat can be stolen... some one steals your wallet... odds are you aren't getting any cash in there back. It's just that the majority of our fiat is stored in insured accounts at banks.
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:49:38
I took a look at something like this a while back. It seems to be one of the best fits I've seen for BTC. It's also probably one of the Gvts biggest fears regarding BTC.
@_date: 2013-06-18 13:06:06
Upvoted...because some buyers not only prefer to have protection but need it because some sellers are scammers as well
@_date: 2013-05-02 14:06:02
Ummm... doesn't the blockchain do just that?
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:16:35
I'd bet on Latvia
@_date: 2013-04-10 21:19:50
I'll tell you one thing... I wish that I had kept my copies of the cypherpunks list archives. There was a lot of stuff there regarding digital currencies and exchanging secrets without either party trusting the other. Bruce Schneier also had a lot of that as well. I can envision scenarios involving encrypted dummy wallets, stenography and shared secrets. Hey that gives me the start of an idea :-)
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:19:50
Thanks for the reply!! 
I think that one of the big things that makes me look sideways at it right now is the fact that we all keep talking about the benefits of Bitcoin for transactions, yet the crazy value swings tend to make it somewhat less useful for puchasing/selling goods, back to my example of Russian ruble in the 90s, when you are selling an item can you price it in BTC if you don't know how big a swing the BTC is going to make on a daily basis. Answer, you don't... so you keep pricing things in an equivalent stable currency (USD, Euro). Maybe its not really a currency at all? Maybe it's something more like digital bearer bonds at the moment. Not saying that it can't become a currency, since the main historical reason for not using gold and using notes instead was portability. Its just that there could be a lot to this, but I'm afraid it might be heading the wrong way
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:29:57
What prevents the "robber-barons" from taking over if you succeed in toppling the gvt.?  Do we end up back in the days of Dickens?
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:50:01
The only spies that would accept BTC are Boris Badenov and Natasha :-)
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:17:00
Don't forget that some people like to use Paypal and CCs because they can be reversed in case of fraud.
@_date: 2013-05-02 15:43:47
Except for the fact that people can do cash to cash txns without needing to go to an ATM at all
@_date: 2013-04-29 01:35:46
Do you have a link?
@_date: 2013-06-18 13:41:16
Something's not adding up... On a complaint case Paypal won't immediately reverse, usually it would show a hold until the case is resolved. Sounds like somehow the sale was arranged to avoid Seller protection. Which is usually a Red-Flag for me.
@_date: 2013-06-18 16:23:04
Problem is, there would have been a hold not an immediate reversal... something smells fishy
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:38:32
Problem with using other countries is that there would need to be some way of transferring the initial currency into the account esp in the US
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:23:47
You said it much better than I could
@_date: 2013-07-18 12:53:45
I don't really see the banks adopting BTC for interbank xfers. They aren't really moving much in the way of cash or hard currency. (Fed reserve flights to Moscow notwithstanding) Plus the FED has a vested interest in keeping these transactions valued in USD esp the international ones.
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:52:18
One quick point... not every progressive liberal is a democrat :-)
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:35:19
How would you inject liquidity? The supply of BTC is limited correct or am I  missing something basic. if so could you explain it like I was a five year old? :-)
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:52:17
That response sounded a little snotty... let me try to clarify...
When we normally think of "fiat currency" we think of governments saying this has value therefore it is valuable.
Aren't we essentially doing the same with Bitcoin... maybe instead of gvt or organization fiat it is "open-source fiat"
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:22:58
Micro transactions without a large fee are doable using bitcoin. Non-reversible transactions between untrusted parties over distances. Neither of which have anything to do with taxes
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:12:03
Netbank already existed
@_date: 2013-04-18 13:35:52
Actually you might want to learn what fiat means before thinking you know what it means
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:44:14
And how many of the local donut shops are gonna have 5 grand sitting in the register to give out?
@_date: 2013-06-18 16:15:22
Only if it was shipped to a confirmed address. But there are other issues with the whole story
@_date: 2013-06-18 12:55:01
So basically if the mediator sides with the buyer he's out the money (which is what happened)
@_date: 2013-08-22 14:55:38
I was just about to ask this as well
@_date: 2013-05-30 15:40:21
In reality PayPal is piggybacking off of the bank's verification process when they use the bank account. Otherwise without verification your txn amounts are limited
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:05:56
But in the examples we keep giving we aren't taking out the middleman all we are doing is changing the middleman (for better or for worse mostly for the better)
@_date: 2013-06-05 15:38:00
It seems to me that a lot of people the decry government want the parts that they like, but don't want the parts they don't like not that they want no government at all
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:22:25
But aren't most of the new people not really interested in Bitcoin per se , but they see an "easy" way to make money. Remember when everybody and their grandma got into flipping houses?
@_date: 2013-05-09 02:12:54
Will the bank be based in the US?

Can I steal this? Best explanation I've ever read.
@_date: 2013-12-24 14:34:31
If a WU is out of cash, you can just go to another one. Usually around the corner if not next door. I don't think there will be that many BTC ATMs around.
@_date: 2013-05-28 16:06:55
I've always thought that the big banks and the gvt have a "You scratch my back, I'll scratch yours kind of relationship". If the gvt wants to nail someone, the info will conveniently show up for them
@_date: 2013-08-27 15:09:56
They did say that small scale laundering would work. Doubt if you'd be able to find someone willing to bring $1 million cash to a parking lot :-)
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:21:50
If they can prove it asset seizure :-)
@_date: 2013-04-11 14:11:01
Are you maintaining arbitrage positions between BTC and hard currency (USD, EURO) only or are using also taking positions in other virtual currencies? Also are you winding down your positions in BTC daily / using paper wallets  or are you leaving BTC in exchange accounts online?
@_date: 2013-06-05 14:58:43
I worked in Russian/Central Europe in the early-mid 90s and got to see the effects of the shredding of the social safety-nets and the rise of the Oligarchs, it's not something I want to see happen here
@_date: 2013-05-09 20:55:10
So we would use the bank account to purchase BTC and you would send it directly to a specified wallet. Will the process be like most banks when the currency isn't on hand... ie you put in a request for x amount and when the currency is avail you can get it
@_date: 2013-05-07 11:31:32
Well you said it better than I did... but not only that how are they going to move to BTC... Open an acct with MtGox... wait 45 days :-) transfer the money to MtGox (who by the way follows AML laws) then put out a massive buy order, which will raise the price of BTC...which will cause more people to hold... which will raise the price of BTC...
Yeah, right
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:44:37
'Cept if you paid with Paypal you can get your money back
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:58:46
What if the ATM is out of cash? Unless you have a huge number of them around that is always possible. Also what about ATM fees? They gotta make their money somehow, so now you are looking at 2 fees (transmission and the one to cash out the coins)
@_date: 2013-08-27 16:32:24
HSBC and BOA would be happy to help with that deposit :-)
@_date: 2013-04-18 14:32:05
You know, that might be it... the exchanges look like they've been modeled on modern Forex systems. Maybe we should be looking at something more lo-tech like an IVTS ( hawala, fei ch’ien or a hundi)
