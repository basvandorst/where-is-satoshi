Capped internet is not suitable for anything besides low level internet use. (fb, browsing, minimal streamig, etc)
Get a proper connection or a server in a decent place.
This argument shouldn't be a reason to leave bitcoin crippled.
@_date: 2015-08-26 06:03:45
Sure, thousands of traders will abandon LBTC because you had a problem. The same way everyone left paypal because it caused problems for some /s

If they've choosen a higher number then a single big pool could veto the decision. It wouldn't make any sense.
@_date: 2015-08-30 04:59:38
Bitcoinist doing clickbait...that's unusual. /s

The miners completely depend on the userbase. Their hands are tied. They risk their business if they go against the users.
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:17:58
Firstly, an 8MB limit doesn't mean 8MB blocksize straightaway! It's just for creating headroom.
Secondly, This sounds bs unless you live in a remote area.
I don't think most people are affected who run nodes already.
A single pc game is more than 35GB on average. HD content is space consuming too.
Capped broadband is useless for any power users. My seedbox uploads terrabytes of data monthly alone for example.
This argument shouldn't be a reason for limiting the rest of the network.

Xt is identical to Core at this stage.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:05:38
I agree with most of your points especially about account termination and I really miss detailed statistics, especially on defaults.


That's a bit harsh considering that it's a startup.
I've been using btcjam for a while, yes there are a lot of scammers, but also a pretty nice community of reputable borrowers and lenders.
Having said that, it is still very high risk (so as any form of lending).
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:45:26
People in australia should lobby their politicians to improve infrastructure instead of the survelliance state.
Or better yet, rent a server somewhere without limits.
Btw, even satoshi foresee that running a full node/mining are not for everyone but professionals and enthusiasts on the long run.
@_date: 2015-08-26 05:53:33
It's open source software.mike can't do anything dodgy.
I'm a lot more concerned about Blockstream though.
@_date: 2015-08-26 09:52:54
That's debunked BS.
It can also be disabled. Or you can run the bip101 only version of xt whih is equal to running core with BIP101.
@_date: 2015-08-28 22:01:23
May I recommend migrating to TooConservativeCoin instead of crippling bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-08-26 05:37:40
Like what :O
@_date: 2015-08-27 13:21:31
No, I implied that the ecosystem should decide, not a dev or a group of devs.
They should create studies and tests not social media fighting or useless live debates.
More science and less bullshiting is needed.
Does not help that Blockstream and representatives didn't hesitate to spread lies and FUD. (xt is altcoin, gavin/hearn evil, centralization, failure, trojan, blacklist, fake satoshi email, etc.)
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:23:49
Apparently, you can't have an adult debate with a bunch of kids especially on a highly censored forum.
Blockstream's conflict of interest is highly on topic and shouldn't be ignored.
@_date: 2015-08-27 20:58:36
You are right partly, as blockstream has been funded in 2014 although stalling core development when it comes to the blocksize limit is a 3 years old thing.
It is also a fact that Blockstream controls Core development.
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:12:02
Ok then please try to construct a decent argument on how hearn is dishonest.
@_date: 2015-08-27 00:05:03
This shouldn't be degraded to reality show levels.
Blockstream should release studies and code instead of this useless crap on social media and asking for live debates.
I cannot believe that people still take them seriously.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:51:23
With optional patches and bip101 implemented.
@_date: 2015-08-26 23:35:16
Apples and oranges.
Miners are functioning in a completely different framework compared to the entities of centralized models.
Edit: I've got an 8 min long delay on my comments and maybe a shadow ban. What a toxic subreddit.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:43:16
How about not trying to follow an authority for once?
@_date: 2015-08-27 11:00:38
Thanks to Blockstream and sockpuppets.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:05:26
Nobody controls or should control development.
Developers can propose ways but the ecosystem has to choose.
As it stands the Core devs seem to dislike freedom of information and choice.
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:48:14
The nodes are not a reliable metric to use for consensus as the numbers can be inflated artificially. This is why triggering forks are the task of miners (you can't fake hashpower).
Also, no high throuput networks are designed with capped connections as priority.
It's like complaining that you can't run a seedbox on your crippleband.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:40:52
It's a fork of bitcoin core. It's a copy of it.
@_date: 2015-08-22 19:04:59
While I enjoyed reading those posts, his involvement through twitter made me question his motives.
I think he deliberately tries to manipulate public opinion and he is aligned with blockstream.
Edit: oh and the tendency to follow the "leaders"
This is why I became bearish...human stupidity is infinite.
@_date: 2015-08-27 08:04:04
No developers are irreplaceable.
Devs with conflict of interest is an existential threat to bitcoin anyways. Blockstream has been acting questionably since their inception.
Stop worshipping people/companies.
@_date: 2015-08-27 05:36:36
Says the troll. Sad that only trolls and shills remained here.
@_date: 2015-08-26 10:02:55
Reading comprehension? Any implementation/dev can be sidestepped.
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:12:14
It doesn't even exist and it's a completely flawed idea anyways.
If anything like this succeeds then I'll dump all my BlockstreamCoin.
@_date: 2015-08-27 07:54:04
It does seem like a hivemind with an apparent agenda and questionable tactics
@_date: 2015-08-23 08:31:45
No, I was refering to the fear mongering and hyping of certain shitcoins.
@_date: 2015-08-28 06:58:56
Did you never comment something incorrectly by mistake? 
I do not make things up. Blockstream employs core developpers and changed the way how alterations can happen to core (unanimous "consensus").
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:58:22
Laughable. Go learn the basics of information technology.
Also, get some sense of logic. Crippling the bitcoin network will mean either centralization or failure down the line.
@_date: 2015-08-30 04:19:52
Considering the amount of FUD I think this will be the most reviewed implementation by far. :)
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:07:26
Too low, still cripple coin category.
BiP101 ftw
As expected blockstream will do everything to cripple the experiment
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:46:44
Your comment doesn't make any sense. If anything it proves your complete lack of insight to this debate.
You should get off the blockstream cool aid.
@_date: 2015-08-30 04:48:32
Vapor....vapor everywhere.
It well worth it to disturb the community, thank you failstream.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:17:53


Are you aware how old is the blocksize limit debate?
I think you completely disregard that Blockstream basically halted any progress in this area
@_date: 2015-08-28 19:02:14
BIP100 is a joke.
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:15:22
Actually BIP101 doesn't even trigger if less than 75% of the blocks are mined on it.
So that scenario is highly unlikely (impossible is a better word).
@_date: 2015-08-20 23:11:48
Also, contrary to the fear mongering campaign, the likeliness of a split is basically impossible because the way BIP101 triggers the fork.
@_date: 2015-08-30 07:59:35
Tbf I have never seen anyone else throwing tantrums, ad hominems and imature attacks like Peter Todd usually does in this space.
Todd creates a toxic environment and his contributions proved to be rather questionable.
I would be happy if he worked only on his shitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-26 15:51:36
@_date: 2015-08-29 22:39:53
It's open source so it's not that he can sneak in anything.
@_date: 2015-08-28 20:55:52
Sure buddy.
@_date: 2015-08-21 17:05:33
I would agree if certain participants didn't obtain too much power.
As it stands all mainstream / bitcoin news sites, the 2 main bitcoin forums favour blockstream, furthermore they have exclusive control over bitcoin development.
@_date: 2015-08-31 17:14:20
Why would anyone rush? Wake me up in January...
@_date: 2015-08-28 21:41:33
It's completely flawed because it gives too much power to the miners and many people dislike bumping into the tentacles of Blockstream everywhere.
@_date: 2015-08-26 22:38:14
Having a crippled bitcoin will not aid decentralization. Neither having a single company complete control over development.
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:07:10
Do you know how BIP101 works?
If majority won't choose it then it won't be triggered and nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-08-29 17:24:42
Which can be turned off or completely bypassed
@_date: 2015-08-23 15:35:31


Should there be a hard fork taken when there is legitimate and wide spread disagreement over the validity of the hard fork?
What a fud spreading, manipulating troll.
The real questions are:
1. Should blockstream keep their influence and tyrannical rule over bitcoin development?
2. Can we ever trust them again even if they rise the limit seeing all the FUD and lies released by them?
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:25:00
This. Bigger blocks enable more users and potentially more people who can afford to run nodes.
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:09:43
Tbf the agent didn't even try to hide his tracks.
I wonder how many thefts like these happen undetected.
@_date: 2015-09-01 22:47:07
No sane person would sign this nonsense.
