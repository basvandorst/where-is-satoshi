so what is really the point of undercutting someone by like 10,20,40,50 you sell for less money, or is it they just don't give a fuck if they cause the market to go down, or is it done on purpose?

you are comparing a digital to a physical - Credit is essentially digital 1' and 0's it has a chargeback system somewhat an insurance policy. He was simply pointing out there is no way to halt, reverse a transaction in the event of a mistake in the address.

yea but you have a bank system in play that can simply put in a reverse request for the money, as well as an insurance policy in play for said money. ACH and wire are direct transfer that the bank supports with known addresses. Have you ever done a chargeback? I have with credit lines and they work. Crypto is still in its infancy and I am sure one day we will have more that what we have now, and I believe in the tech. But again majority want decentralized system and this is what you get with a decentralized system.

Alt-coins get there value from Bitcoin as its the pairing, Bitcoin tanks and there is no other pairing Alt-coins will tank.

You can, just an example if you direct deposit a form of payment to someone you can have it reversed. Same applies to paychecks if a company were to direct deposit to your account and a mistake occurred they can submit a request to reverse the payment. It's in the contract agreement with the payment/deposit company.

@_date: 2018-02-03 09:05:19
I understand that, but why go lower by 50? unless its just binance not being able to keep up and my computer acting slow.

ACH Reversals
National Automated Clearing House Association (NACHA) rules cover if and when a simple reversal is allowed, and there are only three situations that qualify.
Wrong dollar amount: if the wrong amount was transferred (for example, $200 instead of $150)
Wrong account number: if a transfer had the wrong account number and the sender or recipient was not the right account. This is why “bank errors in your favor” are so elusive.
Duplicate transaction: if a transfer goes through more than once, the duplicates would obviously be reversed
In the situations above, the reversal must take place within 5 days, and the affected bank account owner must be notified that her account was debited.
