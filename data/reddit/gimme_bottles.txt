the routine they use to caltulate if you lost or won is completely transparent and can be viewed by the following link:
just replace YOURTXID with the id of the transaction you send your funds with. (it lookscryptic, here is an example for a TXID: f937e8275b6fb1eb9cb01e9c2c5d743085127b0fe54cc8796d401ebd6f90ca58)
to understand the algorythm background knowledge about bitcoin is needed, but also for newbies /non technical users the site above helps to build trust

you can look at the sites code, all the address generating stuff is done on your machine. therefore you can save the site to an usb-stick, transfer it to a pc running a live cd, and generate your address there, without connection to the internet

but getting guns on the darknet became a lot more difficult, since one mayor "firm" closed.
(i will not name it here)

the technical facts about bitcoin are just plain wrong :P
i could not resist to wirte a comment, but i guess it won't make it through moderation...

I shot you a message about donating two ASICMINER shares to you a couple days ago, but i then thought it would be easier for both of us if I just sell them and hand you the BTC this way.
Keep up what you are doing :D

I don't use blockchain.info, so I can't tell you anything about their way implementing paper wallets, but I can tell you about paper wallets in general.
A paper wallet backs up your private keys on paper. You can back up multiple keys, some wallets (eg Armory) can back up an entire wallet, even private keys that you generate after the paper wallet is created.
On security: A paper wallet is theoretically the safest way to store your key, unless you lose or destroy it. So make sure to keep multiple copies in multiple locations.
If you store large amounts of Bitcoins on a paper wallet, you would generate the paper wallet on a computer with no internet access and a plain OS to make sure the keys are safe.
blockchain.info lets you backup your private keys to a paper wallet, but still, they are stored elsewhere. So if someone compromised blockchain.info, they could steal your private keys and your paperwallet would be emptied.
If you want to move to a paper wallet, make sure to generate a new one, for example via bitaddress.org. then move your coins to the newly generated address.

there is a difference between the address generating process for both clients.
Bitcoin-qt pregenerates 100 (that is the standart value, you can change it somewhere) addresses with the corresponding private keys and stores them in your wallet.dat. with every address you use one more gets pregenerated so you are always 100 addresses ahead.
Armory handles it different. it generates a random value (very long to avoid collisions), and all the generated addresses of the wattet are dependant on that value. by example: lets say your random value is "TOTALLYRANDOM", and you start generating addresses, you will always get the same addresses, even on different machines. this is why a paper-backup of a armory wallet is so handy.

i don't use blockchain wallet, but i think it is also called the transaction hash. just copy'n'paste it to the link above, you should then see your game with the amount you gambled with and your outcome

Depending on the level of error correction, some data can really be recovered. This is heavily used, for example when you want to embed an image in the QR code, like [so.](

yes, thats correct, every bitcoin address has one corresponding private key. if you have only the private key, you can generate the address from it. if you have only the address, you can't get the private key. that's the fundamental thing behind bitcoins security.

depends on what you want to do with your coins. if you want to hoard them without spending, create a paper wallet ( print it out and send your coins to the given address. to make it even saver, use a fresh installed os, load the page, disconnect your internet and then print the page. to redeem you need to import the private key into your bitcoin client.
if you want to spend some coins regulary and you are paranoid, look for the offline transaction feature of the armory client. (
regarding the backups: it is recommended that you back up your wallet regulary, eg every day, to an external memory. if you just have an old backup and received funds after you made the backup, it is possible to get those coins, because every wallet has its next 100 addresses already created and stored.

Keep up the great work!

yes, one private key can get you the bitcoins that were sent to  one address. but lets assume the following:
1: you receive bitcoins with address A
2: you back up your wallet.dat
3: you generate a new address B and receive coins with it
4: your wallet.dat gets lost and you did not make a backup after receiving funds to address B
in that case you can still use the first backup, because the private key for your address B was already generated, prior to really using address B

no, QR codes have error correction, so a few missing pixels leave the QR cide still readable

No, they store one, lets call it "base key". From that base key, an infinite number of private keys can be derived. Every of those private keys is dependant on the base key and the previously generated private key. You can imagine it as a chain of private keys that can be enlarged whenever you need a new bitcoin address.
Your second question: If the addresses of your paper wallet are used on the blockchain that means that the private key has signed a transaction and thus has potentially been exposed to threads, eg a compromised PC. That's why users of paper wallets should generate their paper wallets on a freshly installed OS that has never been connected to the internet. Always be a little paranoid :P
