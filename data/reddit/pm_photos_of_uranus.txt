Given the risk and the situation this puts you in, I highly advise you sell all but maybe 1 BTC and put the rest into safer value investments. You could be set for life if you invest correctly. BTC is not safe.

I'll sell you a few at 257 right now if you'd like!

This is why mass adoption of bitcoin is a pipe dream

I concur as to the whole but I want to point out that the most glaring flaw in the current plan for crypto is lack of accessibility. I can guarantee you that my parents will never use bitcoin. I dabble in it but the learning curve was fairly steep and I'm very technologically inclined. It's a very complicated process when you get down to it; getting the masses to suddenly adopt this new, confusing, unprecedented currency is going to be a one in a million shot.

That's a complete load of shit. You humble yourself. Technical analysis isn't what some people make it out to be but it's very plain that you can make some predictions in some circumstances with a degree of accuracy that surpasses pure luck.

That's really poor advice. If you can read technicals you can absolutely see when it is a terrible time to buy. When to go long is tougher and involves a much higher degree of luck but with you're basically telling people to buy knives unquestioningly

This is an incorrect explanation. Criminal vs civil has nothing to do with whether the actor is known. It can be both criminal and civil, however we don't have sufficient facts here to support a crime. Criminal cases don't get your money back. Civil cases do.

Criminal case doesn't get your money back. That comes from the civil end. Criminal cases just punish the criminals.
