I dunno, but nothing says "ready for business use" quite like a backlog of 60,000 transactions.

TL; DR - bitcoin is a gimmick with no future?

It is bitcoins fault it doesn't have a standardized fee. To an outsider, this whole thing seems like an attempt from miners to force higher fees which fucks over users, aka me.

Sigh, now I know, but not before my $200 is lost in cyber space. Will I get it back..?

I'm not a BTC power user man. I have a coinbase wallet and I keep BTC in it and I send it to traders I am buying from. I put in the address, the amount, and I click send. What fee is attached to it is not set by me.
And it shouldn't matter anyway. If the point of bitcoin is to be a usable currency, then it needs a standardized fee. I want to click send on my phone and send money, not get a Math Ph.D. for trying to pay a guy/girl/goat/website for its services.

Congratulations, I'm not adding a $10 fee to transfer $200.

It means you get to watch the crash of bitcoin real time.
And I get to have to spend $200 traditional dollars because the $200 I already spent in bitcoin is floating in nothing.

Correct, but shouldn't I be able to at least view the transactions as recorded? It's on coinbase, and normally I am able to click on the transaction and view hashes, etc.

I just sent it in the most basic way possible, copied the address and amount into coinbase and clicked send. Fuck that site, I'm out as soon as I am sure transactions are going out.
