I'm sorry you are in this situation right now, keep your head above water. 
But a question concerning a possible bankruptcy: What if it happens: Would USD be untouched, so that we were able to withdraw them somehow, or is it more likely that it will be allocated to the losses?
Again: stay strong man.

I want my fucking USD back. They stole BTC so I really want them to seperate their losses from everything that's left.

Zane, is there any way to withdraw $ from Finex in case of NO insolvence and a magical relaunch short/mid term . "hypothetically"
@_date: 2016-08-05 12:53:33
Hey man! I maybe missed the information, so here's my question: 
I only had $ laying in the exchange-wallet. What would be a proper way to withdraw it, once withdrawing is activated? "hypothetically"
I'm german citizen and fully verified. 
Keep up the good communication!

Is it more a matter of days or a matter of weeks till this could be available?
@_date: 2016-08-05 14:36:21
That's a precise answer, thank you!
@_date: 2016-08-03 09:20:46
But how can someone withdraw $ from Hongkong? tell me.

Zane, hypothetical question ahead. Would like to hear a hypothetical answer if possible :)
Is there any way to withdraw $ (just Dollar, since you are in Hongkong) from Finex in case of NO insolvence and a magical relaunch short/mid term.  
@_date: 2016-08-03 11:06:35
my question aswell. but how to withdraw them from Honkong?

And for every bill you pay, let's say 10 a month, you pay big txfees? that's also incredible
@_date: 2015-12-29 15:52:42
Totally natural. This is the true sign of adoption. /s

maintenance-time is usually announced.

Take a look at IOTA-Token. Good for your business. 
@_date: 2017-09-06 00:04:57
Let's remember this convo. See you in 12 month :)
@_date: 2017-09-05 08:48:09
You should buy IOTA instead of Bitcoin, considering the prospect, but good plan!
@_date: 2015-11-26 14:53:43
your words in gods ears man
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:07:24
for the newbs here. what does it mean?
@_date: 2015-11-13 21:54:21
Of course. Either I make profits and sell then, or I'll wait till I can buy bread at a local shop around the corner. I'm not gonna sell the BTC under value.
@_date: 2015-11-13 21:11:11
Well it overcame its ~250$ grave and started to rise again. Now after the last peak it fell but didnt fell to rockbottom. I'm a total newb here but noone thought it would come back like that so isn't that a good signal that it's peeling to ~330 at this moment?
@_date: 2015-11-30 00:34:12
Yeah, at least I knew that. But this picture is full with things I don't recognize.
I own BTC but this image does'nt make sense to me. Especially the different "markets" on the left side. Is this a trader(simplefx) where I can buy/sell with this environment on several pages? 
edit: ah. googled it.
@_date: 2015-11-13 22:04:06
So either way I just wait because BTC-history has shown volatility but that means also that it still can go up like it did 2013. I was asking because a lot of big voices said recently that Bitcoin is dead. And I doubt it.
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:52:56
I mean, that whole thingy has yet to be proven, but *if* it's true, I personally assume that we will see not only the summerhole, but a relatively big reaction by the markets. 
too many hacks/problems in the last quarter. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:44:29
are the markets more stable than back in MT.Gox times, so that a lousy 9% dump is the only reaction to 3 billion dollars confiscated on one of the major exchanges? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:35:55
if true, possible midterm bear-market?
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:36:20
@_date: 2015-11-26 13:49:32
is it certain that bitcoin will rise then?
