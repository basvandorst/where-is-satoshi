I use QuadrigaCX (Canadian),  it took me 48hrs to verify.   Once verified I was able to deposit via online banking, purchase BTC and withdraw to my own wallet in about 15minutes.   I am blown away by the terrible experiences I am reading about Americans having with exchanges.  I don't get the 5 day wait for coinbase people, and this post reminds of my experience with bitcoin-trader.biz (when they folded and runned off with our magic internet monies).   I hope this is incompetence and not conspiracy.

I just follow the fib lines.  If the price moves big either way, they are a self fulfilling prophecy.  If it goes up,  i made money on the ones i picked up at the 204 fib line.  If it goes down,  i pick up more at the lower fib lines.  I dont expect collapse.

Careful, a number of people purchased shares of this business using bitcoins early in the game.  Then the shares where delisted and are not able to be traded.  The legality of the way those shares where issued is in questions and you may have ALOT of people coming out of the woodwork at you.  Proceed with caution.

All im saying is my home PC will not be able to run a fullnode.   Id love to, but the computer will not be able to handle the size of the chain and my ISP will shit bricks. (this assumes a 20x increase in actualnblock size which many have pointed out will not  be the case in the bear term).  Why is this sub so combatitive?  Lets be friends,  Ill start!   I'm proud of you for having such strong beliefs!
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:32:02
Bad as in people modifying the software to give them an unfair advantage.   Maybe they will reject valid blocks from a certain pool and only propagate blocks from their pool, maybe they will reject blocks that have  transactions from certain addresses.... maybe they will hold back longer chains and then release them which will cause other chains to be orphaned allowing a double spend.   The potential for abuse has not been well explored to my knowledge.

My point was that the number of fullnodes will drop dramatically if the blocks increase in size today.  This should not be overlooked.  Are you mad at me?  Because I'd like to be friends!
@_date: 2015-02-10 00:22:14
In a way.   If the fullnodes are controlled by a bad actor,  i believe that is a vector of attack on the network.   If im wrong A bunch of people will explain that to me (usually in an unpleasant manner) in a short moment...
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:04:11
fullnodes verify and broadcast blocks around the network.   when you connect and download the blockchain,  fullnodes are the peers sending the block data to you.
@_date: 2015-02-10 05:00:25
I have buy orders in below the recent lows.  But its taking alot of effort lately not to change those to panic buys!
@_date: 2015-02-08 17:49:39
Without them, there would be no where to get the block information. This contains the transaction information.  Miners mine the blocks, send them to fullnodes who verify, and propagate them along the network.  
@_date: 2015-02-08 00:03:21
I think they already know that and are hoping potential ~~victims~~ clients don't.  (sorry to be cynical, but it's  been a rough year for scams)

I will be turning my fullnode off if block size increases 20x.   Its not just the miners.

Ive had dealings with the owner.  I go the impression he was in over his head.  My guess is when the issue was identified, instead of going through the meticulous process of rebuilding the platform and ensuring that the compromised information cannot be exploited to steal funds, he just gave up.  Lets be honest, with a daily volume of 200ish BTC, the margins are really not there.
@_date: 2015-02-11 03:02:58
Do you mean it's not ready, or never?
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:49:44
I don't complain.  I run it if practical.  If the blocks actual size (many people have informed me this won't happen in the near term) increases 20x, it will no longer be practical for me operate a node.  My intent here is to remind people that the fullnodes are currently mainly run by guys like me.  If we make it impractical for guys like me to run a node this early, there may be trouble.
@_date: 2015-02-08 06:26:36
Would you believe,  compensation for constructive feedback?
@_date: 2015-02-09 23:40:58
K.  Well if it doesn't dramatically increase block size, it should not be an issue.  As I understand the miners will be incentivised to include a minimum of transaction in their blocks (so they win the race) so you may be right.  Why do these interactions need to be negative?

@_date: 2015-02-09 23:43:47
I am hoping that pruning will alleviate the problem from a total chain size perspective.  If the block sizes increase proportionally to my ISPs bandwidth offers, I will happily keep my node running and there should be no issues.
