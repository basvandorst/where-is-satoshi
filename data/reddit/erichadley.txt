Click here to buy the crypto you've never heard of that's about to overtake Bitcoin cuz this discount Bill Gates. 
Wasting your ad dollars on me buddy. But I do find the pic pretty hilarious. Why does this get through adbloker? More questions than answers.

1. Use Tor and/or a VPN to obfuscate your internet packets if Cuban ISPs are packet inspecting and censoring Internet traffic.
2. The great thing about Bitcoin is you can create a wallet offline and send your public address over any medium: text message, a handwritten letter in the mail, carrier pigeon, etc. Now people can send you Bitcoin without anything needing to happen in Cuba.
3. In an extreme situation where you are unable to use a broadcasting node within Cuba, similarly if you want to send Bitcoin you can sign your transaction offline and broadcast the text of your transaction over any medium for someone else running a node to broadcast for you. Again, text message, handwritten letter, pgp-wrapped email, etc.

~44% of nodes in the United States are still running affected versions of Core on MAIN NET. If you are in this camp, please look at running 0.16.3 or 0.13 ASAP!
@_date: 2018-09-24 22:35:53
UPGRADE YOUR DAMN NODE!
and consider running a &lt; 0.13.x instance in parallel for extra precaution
@_date: 2018-09-29 11:21:31
Then downgrade to 0.13, use one of the new binaries to reinstall the patched version of 0.14-0.15, or at the very least stop running the affected node to reduce risk of chain split.

Unconfiscatable, deflationary store-of-value is actually quite good enough.
I'd accept Bitcoin as payment from anyone.

From a certain perspective this graphic sends all the wrong messages about Bitcoin. However, will assume the artist's good intent!

I'm disturbed by the overwhelming support for a soft fork in these replies. Does anyone commenting *really* understand the technical implications of adding something like this? Yet you're ready to run the new software today! This could be a great idea but we need to move slowly. This sort of uncritical support for changes is how bitcoin can be killed by social attacks; raise the 21M limit, etc. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 17:22:20
nice azimuthal projection ;)

This is wrong. You're good with Core, which allows you to download the blockchain and run what is called a "fully validating node." This is the correct way to be a bitcoiner. 
@_date: 2018-10-25 11:46:58
Not crazy. Generate a new wallet/words and never type them in or speak them. 
@_date: 2018-10-15 11:03:21
Great job downloading Core. Next steps are installing/running it. It will take some number of hours/days to sync the blockchain.
You (or anyone) can send bitcoin to a receiving address Core can generate. After something is sent to one of your addresses you will see your balance in the application. You can buy coins for fiat at Coinbase or Square's Cash app, or with cash in person, or you can earn them by doing work for people who will pay in bitcoin.
How much to get is up to you. I usually recommend that everyone try to get their hands on 1 whole bitcoin. You can do this in pieces as small as .00000001 bitcoin. 
Once you have some bitcoin in your wallet, use the menu options in Core to create a backup of your wallet (will create a file like wallet_backup.dat or something) which you can put on a USB stick (or multiple).
Once you have more than a few hundred dollars of bitcoin, boost your security by using a hardware wallet like the Trezor or Coldcard. But keep running Core so that you always have an up-to-date fully validating node.

If there are any I wouldn't trust them yet

Close the channel, then send the BTC from your regular wallet to the exchange. 
@_date: 2018-06-25 11:19:01
This is so spicy thank you so much

Get paid as a continuous stream of BTC.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:36:28
There are around 600k addresses that hold &gt;1 BTC.
Given that people can have as many addresses as they want and many of the addresses with loads of BTC are exchanges/business, I'd guess we're talking a **couple hundred thousand** people in the world are currently sitting on 1 or more BTC.

If you can afford to lose £40 every couple weeks I think this is a great way to start owning some Bitcoin.
I think the value will continue to rise. It's cheap to buy right now. Hold until 2020 and reassess. Then hold until 2024.
Some altcoins will outperform bitcoin in the short run but 99.99% of them will die off. Don't play in this swamp.
We've moved beyond GPU mining. It's way more economical to just buy the bitcoin directly with the money.
One last tip see if a buddy will sell you the £40 worth of BTC directly. Then you can avoid the exchange nonsense and maintain your privacy and anonymity.

You can't link physical objects to blockchains. Nothing can prevent all the opportunities for fraud at the physical-to-digital interface. Blockchains for supply chain management is buzzword marketing.
Bitcoin is THE example of a decentralized blockchain implementation.

Companies and users who are getting cut off from Coinbase clearly don't understand the first thing about Bitcoin-- controlling your own private keys. Gab can just post their own BTC address or set up a Lightning node. Stop using shitty centralized hubs like Coinbase! No one is making you!

Or even pay for video by the second/frame.

Delusional or dishonest.

I see the joke, actually lol'd. People seem to think you are a bot account on the fritz. If they just went a step further in their logic they would see how funny this is.

Can't speak from experience. GreenAddress works pretty well.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:25:39
Get your coins off the exchange and move them to a hardware wallet (like Trezor) or, less ideally, at least a wallet where you control your private keys. Run a full node like Bitcoin Core. Don't worry about the price. If you're in this to get rich you're doing it wrong.

Holy extrapolation, Batman. There was one poll taken last week where 200 current college students answered in the affirmative. Now not only do 65 million Americans own crypto, but these are just the ones who bought with student loan money?
From the description of the study linked to in the article:
In a recent survey conducted by The Student Loan Report, we found that 21.2 percent of current college students with student loan debt have used financial aid money to fund a cryptocurrency investment.
The survey was administered over the course of four days and the participants were ​asked the following question: "Have you ever used student loan money to invest in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin?"

This is a very important question irrespective of if Cobra bought some Bcash. Points of centralization are security holes. Imagine someone in control of the domain linking users to malicious versions of Bitcoin Core. We need to come up with a way to decentralize this more.

Impossible to not say this in my head every time I hear someone getting two of something. Classic!

@_date: 2017-10-25 11:20:45
Pretty sure Roger Ver made SegWit into a controversy and pushed bigger-block hard forks as the only solution to the mempool spamming he was doing with his buddies. Problem, reaction, solution. He never wanted to come to a consensus around scaling. The plan was to create Bcash from the beginning, pump the price, and make millions.

As others have said, just buy .1 BTC or even .01 BTC.

Stopped by and Derrick walked me and my fiancee though sending pgp messages back and forth on Tails. She totally grokked it! Really nice guys that run this spot and the Free State Bitcoin Shoppe two doors down.
The one thing to know is that they are out of the free state libertarian movement, which I totally support, but unfortunately this often means they are very much in the Bitcoin Cash/Dash/Monero camp. I'll do my best to bring them to the light side, starting with getting them to read The Bitcoin Standard. On our side I think we can do better at explaining SegWit.
They support Bitcoin regardless, and have helped other shops in town get set up to accept Bitcoin. You can buy all sorts of things downtown and get lunch at Street and pay for everything in Bitcoin or Dash. It's a pretty neat glimpse of the future.

Looks good! I'm curious-- what API you are using to get the market data? Also how are you able to get the coin icons?
@_date: 2018-04-22 12:12:10
Big if true.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:49:47
The smartest thing to do is to set up a wallet on your phone or computer so that you control the private key. This won't automatically split coins for you after the fork, but you can find instructions on how to do that later.
The lazy and risky thing to do is transfer your coins to an exchange or wallet service that has explicitly stated they will handle the split and give you those coins. You might be angry if the exchange only gives you ~85% of the split coin, like Bitfinex did with bcash.

Download Cash app on phone and Bitcoin Core on desktop/laptop. The Cash app will give you ability to buy BTC for fiat. Bitcoin Core will be your Bitcoin wallet. You will withdraw your BTC from Cash to Core and now you own BTC.
