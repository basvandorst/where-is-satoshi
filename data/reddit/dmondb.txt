My favorite relatives, circa '16
E: they all came running in '17 during the rush to ask if I still had it lucky you, you made copies. I made the mistake thinking they would care, but paper is forgettable if it isn't a "formal document" to the plebes.

For real, assholes use a Coinstar machine but "does not accept coins for Bitcoin."
I used Rockitcoin twice, second time I could not redeem my fiat and it took THREE fucking days to get support to do anything. Their support didn't know they could verify a tx on the blockchain and had to do whatever verification "process" they have in place to get me my funds.

That's why the Bitcoin community is the best! 
I just can't figure out if he had sent money to a different wallet then sent it to you wouldn't he have noticed then? And yeah, 2 tx 30 min apart, did he send it to you on accident after you had already left? It's bad practice to copy and paste addresses without confirming them with the receiver on his part for this exact reason. I'm guilty of it myself, lesson learned.

Is that what he tells you or have you seen proof? He may not want to admit that he himself got scammed. Or it's still early in the ponzi scheme and the guy that makes all this money still has people signing up. But once that stops he will cut and run. I mean you just have to ask yourself. 
It just screams scam. If you could make more than 100$ with just 25$ how long would you do that until you decided to just keep it. People like that just plain do not exist, especially from the internet.

I'd say we're pandemic virus rather than endemic one, otherwise I agree full-heartedly.

They cant call something the people control a currency. They know as soon as its known to the general public as a currency that people will drop fiat in a heartbeat and all those millions dollars become worthless virtually over night.

To answer the question, no.
Depending on the type of order made (market, stop, limit) and amount you are willing to buy/sell will determine where on the order book you will be placed.
Market orders are fairly instant as it will attempt to fill the order priced at what the market is currently trading at for a given coin/token. This is considered a "taker" position and does not populate the order book but clears positions, reducing liquid volume.
A limit order will limit the price you are willing to buy/sell at. These orders are generally for longer positions as you are anticipating the trend and are trying to capitalize on the swing. These orders take your coin and place it on the order book for the amount you specify. It is a "maker" position and increases liquid volume.
Stop limit is essentially a type of order that will become a limit order once a user specified price is reached. You input 2 prices, a stop price (which triggers the placement of the actual limit order) and the limit price (which is the price you limit what you're willing to buy/sell for)
For example.
You bought Bitcoin at $7500 and it is now trading at $8000. The price is beginning to drop, but dont want to lose any gains. Place your stop price at 7900. This means that your order will not go on the order book until the price reaches 7900. The limit price entered in stop limit orders is exactly that of a normal limit order. In this example we will set our limit to 7700. This means we will not take anything less than 7700, be aware that these orders may not get filled entirely before the price changes beyond your limit.
With all that said, orders are cleared off the book in order of market demand and chronologically. If you want to sell your one Bitcoin at 8k but there are already orders for 50 Bitcoin to be sold at 8k your order will not clear until all 50 BTC is cleared from the order book. Another caveat is that if the price continues to drop, a lot of people will place orders pennies under large volume orders at a loss to get out a position quicker.

People taking gains is completely normal. Corrections will always take place on the way up. Most day traders would be silly not to take their gains in a bull rush like this. Until everything is priced in Bitcoin people will take gains against their respective local fiat for purchases

Sounds great in theory but unless operating a lightning node becomes profitable I dont see any U.S based exchanges implementing one.
With that said, companies should stop looking at the bottom line and realize that the more nodes there are the more decentralized its becomes and therefore more immutable/unfungible.
Something the BCH camp just doesn't understand.
Keep up the good work!

Well its argued that PoW coins like Bitcoin creates centralization through mining which is hypothetically true but is not the case with Bitcoin. 
For example (and this always pisses people off for some reason)
Bitcoin a Bitcoin Cash are both Proof of Work.
Bitcoin Cash is centrally owned by Roger Ver
Bitcoin is DEcentrally "owned" by the 3000+ verified contributors and thousands of independent miners
Bitcoin Cash owns all of their miners and has their devs on payroll. Which, if you are running a business is required. 
Now what does that mean?
If at any time Bitcoin Cash wanted to, they can manipulate their network for personal gains because of how small and centralized the network is. 
Bitcoin would require the consensus of tens of thousands of people. They get feedback from their supporters and make decisions based on said feedback.
Bitcoin wasn't created to make any money off it and if your plan was to make something truly decentralized like Satoshi did, you do it at a loss not trying to make money off their project. People forget and newbies need to learn that Bitcoin and its supporters operated at a loss for years before even pizza guy got on the news.
Ik this sounds like I'm bashing BCH in particular but it's the easiest example I could lay out. I like BCH for what it can do RIGHT NOW but all cryptos in their respective forms can NOT compete with current payments processors realistically. We are all trying and know that day will come but until then, use what's safest even if it's still fiat... for now

I hate to be negative Nancy here but gold will still have value after we are hit by a solar flare like the Carrington event and instantly erases all digital record. Might not be worth as much as clean water will be at the same time but still... :D

First, do NOT put all your savings into ANY crypto. Any financial advisor in any market would tell you that's just stupid. Only put what you can AFFORD to LOSE as cryptocurrency is an extremely volatile market. 
Take it slow. Dont jump in and buy 20 different currencies. Do yourself a favor and buy something that is cheap and has a lot of coins for the price but still has support (like DOGE) and "play" with it. Learn how to create cold wallets, transfer funds, sign keys, etc.
Decide what you want to do with your cryptocurrency that you buy. Are you going to use it for payments? Are you going to use it as a savings? Are you looking for long term growth? IMO buying and holding or HODL is the best bet. Dont get caught up in the "day trading" phase unless you're truly dedicated as it takes real work and there's no easy way to get 2×, 3× your returns in any short time frame.
Dont get discouraged and sell because your (for example) bitcoin dropped 40% in a week because it happens very often. Try to move your thinking from how much purchasing power you have with your bitcoin compared to a (EDIT)*fiat* and remember that even if its value to a particular fiat pair drops significantly that 1 bitcoin still equals 1 bitcoin. 
Just something quick for you to skim, hope it helps!

Coinbase itself is fine, but dont use the phone app. Leave it on your desktop so it requires you to have access to it rather than it being in your pocket.
I personally dont like moving my funds off my cold wallets and only move funds if/when I need them (which should be not anytime soon). Anything you keep on a hot wallet (i.e anything used to store your funds with an active internet connection) is susceptible to being hacked/stolen.
@_date: 2019-05-21 05:46:33
Ok since people are taking this seriously
In my world ending solar flare scenario where the flare is strong enough to knock out all orbiting satellites, blow the capacitors in every electronic component, even affect the contents of cold stored coins in your DIY faraday cage.
What I was joking about was how gold would have value because it actually exists and is tangible. But with the world ending catastrophe happening simultaneously, I would say people value clean water more than they would gold.
Horse beat enough for you?
