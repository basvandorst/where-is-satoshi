Not sure what those links have to do with sending international money wires which you claim "often isn't an option anymore".
Regardless, I don't see anything too concerning about the first link which could be Wellsfargo doing their due diligence in fraud detection which is extremely prevalent in the world of bitcoins. I haven't heard of them closing/freezing accounts involved in legitimate bitcoin transactions and I personally have done many without any problems.
The second link was Wellsfargo complying with a US federal warrant because Mt.Gox did not register as a "Money Service Business". Every bank in the country has most likely complied with federal warrants by freezing accounts.
While I'm not a big fan of big banks they do provide services that my credit union does not (such as international money wires)...

Technically getting a refund doesn't change your tax obligation. Neptunes were priced in USD (which is why you get USD refunded) so the taxable event was when you spent the BTC thus capital gains tax are due regardless if you get a refund or not. Basically any time an American spends BTC they have to report that as capital gains (or loss) to the IRS based on the price you bought the BTC at. Major PITA :(
KNC misled a lot of people with their "customer appreciation" Neptune pre-orders that falsely advertised a possible "Q1" delivery. Very sad...

It helps verify it was a cash deposit (and not a check for example) since the bank I use for cash deposits does initially state what type of deposit was made via their website. It's also useful in cases where you are waiting for 2 deposits of the exact same amount so I can verify which buyer made their deposit.

I like to think of Bitcoin as simply the logical advancement of "money" just like the internet is the logical advancement of "communication". Money is a tool society uses in many different ways with varying degrees of success. A few things Bitcoin advances on our traditional "money":
- Can not be counterfeited. This can not be said for any other currency to date as even gold is "forged".
- Fixed limited supply. Again something no other currency can offer. Gold is still constantly mined and actually quite common in the universe.
- Extremely portable and secure. No bank/wallet needed as Bitcoin can be possessed with only a thought but does have the weakness of being dependent on the Internet but the strength that the Internet is global.
That's just my top three off the top of my head. If you really think about the implications Bitcoin will be extremely disruptive. Given time, humanity will exploit these advances to improve societies in ways we still have yet to image...

You need BTC in an exchange if you want to leave limit orders up. For example if you want to take advantage of the many spikes that have occurred you need to leave BTC sell orders up 24/7 since it's almost impossible to take advantage manually before the price crashes back down.

The amount of down votes this comment has is depressing. For those that have confused an increased money supply with inflation:
Yes we can predict the supply of Bitcoins but we can not predict the demand. Thus we cannot predict the price and therefor cannot predict the level of inflation/deflation.
Edit: Actually I worded that incorrectly. You can predict the increase in circulation but not supply as many Bitcoins are not for sale. Therefor you can not predict the supply or demand of Bitcoin.

You weren't talking about Luke's technical competence but the morality of miners attacking minority chains.
Luke Jr, a core dev, killed multiple sha256 alt coins with 51% attacks to the point it could be argued it's the reason alt coins switched to scrypt POW algorithm. Of all my criticism of Luke, that is not one of them because that is the nature of blockchain technology. Morality does not secure a blockchain...

What makes BU hostile exactly? I am a long time Bitcoin user and I personally want larger blocks. You might not want the same but all XT, Classic, and BU have done is offer this option to miners and node operators.
The only way seeing that alternative clients as "hostile" makes any sense to me is if you feel that core is the central authority for Bitcoin development.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:53:07
Wow, this is incredibly disingenuous. Are you claiming that the intent of your mining wasn't to destroy the value of the coiledcoin blockchain? Anybody who doubts the innocence of your intentions can read your [comment]( in the thread where the dev states coiledcoin is "dead courtesy of a &gt;51% attack by Luke Jr".

That would still only be a temporary solution and we could end up in this same situation down the road if we start hitting full blocks again.  If we're going to hard fork to fix the scaling issue, let's do it for a solution which solves the problem permanently which is what the BU's approach does.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:18:48

If that is the case I am still confused. Why would you buy when the price dips? You can only identify a price dip AFTER it has occurred and the price has recovered. So he is saying that when the price drops from $650 to $550 and rises back to $650, he buys at $650 because it dipped?

I'm starting to wonder how many people don't really understand how and more importantly WHY bitcoin works.
To even use the term "hostile takeover" implies you don't understand the decentralized shared consensus nature of bitcoin and instead view the "central authority" to be core and thus blockstream who employs a lot of the core developers.
There have been hardforks in the past, were those hostile take overs?
In reality, there is no central reality to make decisions on the evolution of bitcoin. Any time there is a disagreement, such as the case with scaling, then competing solutions and implementations are presented and miners and node operators can chose which to support. If there is majority consensus that requires a hardfork then that is not a "hostile take over".
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:11:08
Skipping a block would not be considered behaving properly because that means it has loaded an invalid blockchain.

I'd be curious to see the commit % as well as lines of code contributed to both SegWit and overall total.
Regardless, it's silly to suggest that even 25% of developers who are paid by a for profit private corporation have little influence on the process. One quarter is not a trivial amount.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:51:16


If they did that then the giant block would not get relayed and would get orphaned. Why would any miner do that? They will only mine blocks that will propagate and become part of the chain. In fact they will only mine blocks they deem are the optimal size to guarantee getting included in the chain while maximizing the number of transaction fees.


That's your definition. That's like saying a web server is a user. The people USING bitcoin are those sending and receiving it. The "user" in UASF indicates exchanges etc, not node operators who hold very little influence. I will note that you mean node when you say user.


Wow, that's it? I'm sure you read that in some UASF propaganda based on a line in the white paper but the fact is that miners are the ones that do the work and they are the ones that secure the network. They are the ones that prevent double spending and a majority of that work is required to change the protocol. In the event of a UASF, miners could still refuse to activate SegWit and mine the current chain and new exchanges not part of the UASF would instantly pop up to allow them to sell their bitcoin. The UASF supporting exchanges would have no way to even transact with out the miners! I hope core does try a UASF because they will prove that miners are the ones in control as intended.


I really don't think you understand the fundamentals of how a blockchain works. Nodes do not have the vast majority of the power now. You can't activate SegWit via nodes. All the UASF does is try to force the miners to activate SegWit by starving them. It will still be the miners choice to change or not, nodes can not activate SegWit. In the event of a UASF, nothing stops brand new exchanges from popping up so it will fail.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:47:03
In other words you have no argument. Got it. As a bigger block supporter I would love to know why I am "hostile". If bigger blocks would have a negative effect on Bitcoin, I would love to know why as well but so far in my attempts to engage those against it, I can't get a sound argument.
@_date: 2017-03-15 22:24:06


Well there you go. You can't back up your claim with any legit sources, got it.


You indicated the true functionality of the block size settings is "disguised". Not that you have a different interpretation of the effect of that functionality. Regardless, the functionality assumes miners are going to maximize their individual profits. They won't want to mine blocks that the network won't except and they won't want to leave transaction fees on the table either. They will naturally find the most efficient block size based on the evolving state of the network.
@_date: 2017-03-19 23:25:57
It might not make sense if you think in terms of a central authority where Core or BU devs make decisions. That is not how any of this works. BU doesn't get to decide. They only provide the tool.
BU provides a scaling solution that allows the network to find consensus for block size on the assumption that miners will intelligently seek the most profit. At any time a miner can create a +1MB block. Right now that block would most likely be orphaned and unsupported by exchanges.
If a hardfork occurs, it will most likely happen when big blocks are supported by 75%+ of mining hashrate, major exchanges, and wallets. That is when a miner might feel that they will make more money by mining a larger block to capture as many transactions as they can.
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:35:41
I'm pretty sure it doesn't. I haven't tested myself but I'm pretty sure that core does not handle a locally cached invalid blockchain gracefully. There's really little reason for either client to invest the resources to gracefully handle this situation which is an edge case that is avoided with a fresh install.
@_date: 2017-03-26 23:33:43
Thinking you can simply base your price on worth in a market where your competitors have a lower price (and cost) is a sure way to lose market share.
I really hope that core does not believe people will pay a premium to use Bitcoin simply because it has brand recognition as the first blockchain. It's going to be a competition in perceived security and reliability and having an artificially high cost to due restricted block size is going to put Bitcoin at a disadvantage...
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:41:55


I run a Classic and XT node as well and will run any node that supports larger blocks.
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:16:25


What? First, if they had majority of the hashpower they could literally double spend transactions. There are far larger risks than "too big of blocks" if somebody has majority control of the hash power!
Second, what would a miner gain by mining on a chain too large to propagate? The chain would be worthless.


I want them and so do many many more. What other blocks will there even be? You can't create a block with a node or an exchange.  What blocks will you have if if the miners decide to ignore the USAF? Do you see how it's still the miners choice in the event of a USAF?

How would you like me to prove I am a genuine Bitcoin user? (I am)
@_date: 2017-03-17 18:38:50


Again this idea only works if you believe that core is the central authority.
You realize that Bitcoin has hard forked in the past right? When there were two incompatible nodes on the network, what decided which ones were legitimate? Guess who? The miners! They decide by choosing which protocol to support.
This is what keeps just anybody from changing the protocol. Exchanges can't decide. Wallets can't decide. Users can't decide. All they can do is present protocols that miners can opt to use or not. The miners decide what a "legitimate bitcoin node is", not you or I.
If 75% of miners decide to support a BU hardfork then the "core chain" will now have 25% of the hash power. Exchanges will have to decide if they want to support a chain with 13 minute blocks or one with 40 minute blocks. The core chain will also be less secure and open to 51% attacks. The market will decide the value of these two chains.
It might not play out as well for the minority chain as it did with the Etherium Classic hardfork because Bitcoin's difficulty doesn't correct as quickly...
@_date: 2017-03-28 23:42:20
That's not what he did. If you send a SegWit block to a BU node it rejects it. What he did was download a SegWit block via core, then switched the client from core to BU which did not gracefully load the invalid blockchain from the local cache. It would be like trying to load the Etherium blockchain from Core and making a fuss if core crashed.
@_date: 2017-03-29 03:15:58
Those consensus rules are determined by a majority hashrate. If 80% of the miners start mining segwit blocks or +1MB blocks, the economic full nodes will start validation those new consensus rules. It's obvious that now that miners haven't shown majority support for SegWit, BlockStream is trying to change the narrative away from miners creating consensus.

Claiming that 25% of the people the contribute to a project have NO influence on the maintainers is either naive or disingenuous. The reason that Gavin relinquished control of the core repo to those currently in charge was to avoid the politics which says a lot...
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:09:04


Are you saying with SegWit that a block will be larger than 1mb? If so then you don't understand SegWit. The total transactions recorded in the block will be larger than 1mb but the block will still have a max size of 1mb.


Theoretically. The capacity increase depends on the type of transactions being recorded. All of the high estimates assume a high volume of large multisig transactions which give the most "compression". I would put the increase at 1.7 to 2.4 based on my research which is not enough.


Please elaborate. I'm trying to take you seriously but I just don't see how you can make the argument that increasing the block size DESTROYS BITCOIN. Would love to hear more...
Increasing the block size is probably the simplest and easiest scaling option. It's practically 1 line of code. SegWit has quite a bit more risks and possible flaws that have not been uncovered as it is vastly more complex. 
@_date: 2016-01-14 17:43:36
I have a simple test you can use to determine if they are altcoins. Install the client you suspect is an altcoin, say BitcoinXT. Import your private keys from Bitcoin Core into the BitcoinXT client. Send all of your "XT coins" to 1HB5XMLmzFVj8ALj6mfBsbifRoD4miY36v. Now check your Bitcoin Core client to see if you still have any Bitcoin. If not then it's not an altcoin ;)
@_date: 2017-03-24 19:45:43
Wow, so many Bitcoin users really have no idea how it works.


If 100% of the miners decide to make a change that 100% of the users disagree with, guess what happens. There is only 1 chain for the users to follow. They have no choice.
Miners do the work that makes a blockchain possible, not the users. It's designed so that it's in the miners best interest to create a blockchain that has utility for users which will increase the value of their work. The miners work for the users in essence but they are ultimately in control collectively.
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:00:18


I stand corrected. I wasn't aware that the extra witness data was actually recorded in the blockchain. TIL. That means SegWit is not truly a fully backwards compatible softfork as native nodes are given "filtered" blocks and thus are no longer full nodes. They aren't even relay nodes! SegWit via softfork is even more convoluted that I originally had realized! It should be a clean hardfork. This fact also completely negates every argument against bigger blocks without SegWit!


Do you have a source on this?


You might want to read up on BU. You can read about the MG, EB, and AD settings here:  It's a pretty clever way to allow a dynamic block size based on signaling from the entire network.
@_date: 2017-03-16 23:27:13
Not sure where your comments on "open source" come from as I didn't mention that in my comment at all.


This is the only thing in your reply that makes any sense which was exactly my point. If the miners decide to back BU, that's not a hostile take over.
@_date: 2017-03-27 21:23:11
The list on the left should include Classic devs as their client will support a bigblock chain as well.
I would be willing to bet that if 75-80% of miners create a bigblock hardfork supported by BU and Classic nodes and manage to kill the smallblock blockchain supported by core nodes that core will update their client to support the new bigblock chain. Will probably be easier to get SegWit support at this point so no reason to just throw in the towel especially if the hardfork to bigger blocks is successful.
@_date: 2017-03-16 01:08:51


You can't just claim that statement is backed by logic. You made the claim that "BU completely removes the ability of users to audit the blocks miners produce, and allows the majority of miners to create blocks that other miners cannot audit (thus drive them from the network)". You can't just say that statement is true "because logic". A source would be independent facts that back up your assertion. That statement really doesn't make any sense, maybe you can clarify if you don't have any source?


You keep referring to users. Do you mean node operates or people creating transactions or both?
Why do you say "disguised"? The functionality is clear as day for anybody to review.
I'm curious how you think BU would cause mining to centralize. Regardless, a majority of miners already make all of the decisions so not really sure what you're trying to say here. Who do YOU think "makes all of the decisions right now"? Core?
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:12:20
Sounds like another core supporter who doesn't understand what a fork is. Some of us aren't afraid of forks which create TWO networks and I want to be on the one with larger blocks. Unless you think the block size will NEVER need to be increased then you have to accept that at some point a fork is required.
@_date: 2017-03-28 22:15:50
Have you tried this? Does it gracefully load the blockchain to the point of the big block then gracefully overwrite that big block and subsequent invalid blocks with new valid blocks?
@_date: 2017-03-07 18:07:54


From my POV, there was a healthy debate about how to approach the scaling issue until the censorship started. That is what really damaged my faith in core's intentions. They no longer seemed confident enough to let their arguments stand on their own but instead tried to control the narrative and stifle discussion on alternate solutions.


Many of us remember that Gavin was an original core developer that worked directly with Satoshi and was once the maintainer of the core repo before relinquishing control to avoid politics. Those who agree with his approach towards solving the scaling issues don't see it as "taking over bitcoin" but continuing the mission described in Satoshi's whitepaper.

BU is open source. That is how it works.
@_date: 2017-03-24 23:38:55


Yes, that means they had no control over the previous blockchain that they are leaving. Now they are at the mercy of the miners on the altcoin that they are joining who will be in ultimate control of that blockchain as well.


You said "No, in the end it is the users who have all the power not the miners". That is simply not true. It's a relationship where miners have control of the blockchain who's value is derived by demand by users. Users influence the decisions of the miners through their demand of the miners work but the miners are the ones that ultimately decide the protocol of the blockchain.


Yes and they will need miners to secure that new chain and those miners will then be in control of it.
@_date: 2017-03-15 18:40:54
I wish I could but that's up to the miners and if you noticed, there currently is more miner support for BU than for SegWit which, by the way, is not a block size increase. The small capacity increase SegWit allows will only help with scaling very temporarily so a REAL block size increase will still be urgently needed. BU permanently solves the block size issue.

In theory a publicly traded stock's price is based on it's earnings but in reality they are all extremely overpriced based mostly on speculation. The vast majority of stocks pay less % in dividends than inflation. These days the price is more about speculation, much like crypto markets.

How much income did you make on FB dividends? Last I checked FB has yet to make a single payout so the stock has made it's shareholders $0. It's all based on speculation.

Of course not. When somebody invests in stock they can expect to turn a profit in two ways. One is through dividends and the other is by selling the stock at a higher price. Right now the vast majority of investors are looking for the former. Everybody is speculating on growth, not investing in existing performance.
Apple just payed one of the largest dividends in history this summer which was still less than 2% and will be lucky to beat inflation. 
If you compare the value of public stocks to their current earning potential, everything is deeply over valued. The value is based almost purely on speculation that demand for the stock will increase, much like crypto markets.

The average Joe would never. The only people who have any incentive to secure a blockchain at a loss are large stake holders. I want no part in any blockchain relying on "average Joe's" to mine at a loss because it's not feasible...
Also, it's not the price of power, but the exchange rate and difficulty that determines which chain is more profitable to mine.

That's not how atomic swaps work. The exchange rate is not fixed nor determined by token supply. They simply let you trade tokens on one blockchain for tokens on another without a trusted third party.

Back in the day you could mine gold using a pan in a stream (CPU). Eventually somebody learned you could use a pickaxe (GPU) to dig it out of the ground even faster. Soon everybody was using pickaxes depleting the easy to reach  surface level gold making it harder to mine so somebody invented a backhoe (ASIC) that was specially designed to mine gold. Now the average Joe can no longer mine gold because he can't afford a fancy expensive backhoe and using a pickaxe now mines less gold than the cost of the pickaxe...

OP posted a valid concern that has been floating around about BIP100 and asks if the creators have addressed it, plain and simple. No demands, just a simple question asking if this concern has been addressed. It sounds like he doesn't even know Jeff Garzik is the author of BIP100 and probably doesn't know where to look to find the answer which is why he's posting it on Reddit.

Again it appears that you don't understand how multisig works either. Almost all of multisig's benefit exists right now. The issue is that the use of multisig increases transaction size putting even further pressure on the block size limit. Without segwit then we'll see less transactions fitting into 1MB blocks as multsig is used more and more. There is currently no reason for a wallet to NOT implement multisig without segwit.


Again this shows you lack a fundamental understanding of segwit and multisig transactions. Segwit ONLY saves space/fees in relation to a non-segwit transaction. A segwit multisig transaction will still be larger than single sig segwit transaction and WILL NOT SAVE FEES.

@_date: 2016-02-22 22:11:27
Yes the vast majority will OVER TIME. It's going to take awhile for every single software and hardware wallet to implement support and some will never do it. We know for sure it's not going to be 100% day 1 so saying 2MB is not accurate. Day 1 will be more like 1.6MB and slowly increase from there. By the time enough multisig transactions are being used to fit 2MB in a 1MB block, the blocks will have already been filled long ago...
@_date: 2016-02-23 00:36:48

@_date: 2016-02-23 18:46:32
Now you're just repeating yourself. You're clinging on to a single NON-TECHNICAL quote and ignoring information directly on the official core website that completely contradicts your claim lolol.
Here's the best part. Are you aware that Gavin is the guy that helped create the Bitcoin Classic client? Yes, the guy you are quoting does not believe segwit will provide the capacity increase needed and literally wrote a client to hardfork to larger blocks. Too funny...
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:19:35
Again, to see 2MB fit into a 1MB block you need both segwit AND multisig. Those wallets you listed do not force all transactions to use multisig. The vast majority of those wallets will still be sending standard single sig transactions. Find me a link showing all of the wallets with multisig enabled for all transactions by default. Actually find me ONE wallet that currently does. Good luck...
There's another factor you may not understand about multisig transactions. It's the SOURCE of a transaction that determines it's size, not the destination. So let's pretend that day one every single wallet supports segwit and uses multisig by default. Guess what, still 1.6MB because everybody's coins are still going to be in single sig addresses. When I move my cold storage in a year, guess what, still a single sig transaction.
Day 1 will be 1.6 and by the time we're at 2.0 the blocks will have been full for quite awhile...
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:57:06
No, you do not understand what Gavin is saying. I will try to explain this to you one more time before you embarrass yourself further.
Gavin is saying that segwit will allow 2-3 times more transactions per block ONLY IF EVERY SINGLE transaction is using multisig. He's not predicting when that will occur. So when we are talking about scaling we are interested in day 1 block size after it's released. If you look at the number of transactions that are currently using multisig RIGHT NOW it's very small so when segwit it's released, we will have around 1.6MB of transactions in a 1MB block. That efficiency will increase as the use of multsig increases and nobody is currently avoiding the use of multisig because segwit is not out so it's not going to happen over night. It's going to start at 1.6MB and increase from there, not 2.0MB.
@_date: 2017-04-05 22:26:33


"core" is just slang for the original client implementation started by Satoshi.


You're just arguing semantics. The code base that Gavin moved to GitHub is what core is today and Gavin was in charge of it after Satoshi dissapeared. That could be described as "leaving Gavin in control of core" since Satoshi abandoned the SourceForge code base.


Do you have any source on this being his reason for handing over control of core? Looks like Gavin was making lots of commits leading up to him stepping down to me (still in top 4 even now): 
@_date: 2016-02-22 20:37:29
Yes, they save even more because they are inherently larger. If you believe a 15/15 multisig transaction will save space over a normal singlesig transaction, then you definitely are ignorant to how segwit operates.
It's like saying a zipped text file saves more space when you add a bunch of white space to the end of it. Just because the zipped whitespace bloated file "saves more space" doesn't mean the resulting zip file will be smaller.
Edit: To help you understand, let's say a normal single signature transaction is 1.5KB. If you make that same transaction a 15/15 multisig it might now be 15KB. With segwit they might both be around 1KB when recorded in a block. So yes the 15/15 saved more space but the resulting transaction is NOT smaller than a normal transaction.
@_date: 2016-02-23 20:16:31

No it's quite funny. You just keep revealing your ignorance.


Are you aware that Gavin was the LEAD DEVELOPER of core and it's maintainer on github and voluntarily stepped down because he wanted to stay out of the politics? He's the closest link to Satoshi and was already in control.

I have a suggestion. Instead of clinging onto this quote from Gavin that you obviously don't understand, why don't you do some independent research yourself and see if you can come to the same conclusion you think Gavin has. All of the information is out there and you can reference that instead of this quote over and over.
Here's a link directly to Bitcoin.org to get you started:
Search for this question:


At the bottom you'll find:


So yes, Gavin was talking about multisig transactions. The only way you can fit 2MB of transaction data into a 1MB block is if they are all 2/2 multisig segwit.
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:02:45
Are you sure you understand how segwit works? You will not save fees by using a 15/15 multisig transaction over a normal transaction since both will be around the same size with segwit. If you look at the typical transactions taking place right now, segwit will allow around 1.6MB of transactions to be stored in a 1MB block on average.
@_date: 2017-04-06 03:00:44


The "Bitcoin project"? Nope, "core" is slang for the full name "Bitcoin Core" which is not "the Bitcoin project" but a single client implementation originally created by Satoshi. The Bitcoin network now consists of many different node types, so you can't really call core "the Bitcoin project".


Except neither you nor I worked closely with Satoshi immediately before he disappeared and abandoned the SourceForge code base. Satoshi could have given the keys to that project to somebody but chose not too so it can easily be said he "left" the project in Gavin's hands. Gavin didn't just "nab a namespace". He continued the work on Satoshi's code which has evolved into what we now call Bitcoin Core. It's not like there were a bunch of competing forks after Satoshi disappeared and Gavin just got lucky grabbing the Bitcoin name on GitHub. It was a seamless continuation of Satoshi's work and Gavin was in full control because he was at ground zero when Satoshi disappeared.


I see more commits from Gavin prior to relinquishing control than many other prominent core devs make now. Is this all you have to base your assertion that he gave up control because "he had not been contributing any code for some time prior"? For the record, here his what he said at the time:
"Today, I find it harder and harder to keep up with all of the great Computer Science or Economics papers related to bitcoin and other crypto-currencies […] to be clear: I’m not going to disappear […] I’ll just spend a little less time writing Bitcoin Core release announcements, and a little more time catching up on the latest bitcoin-wizards thinking on how best to implement transaction history pruning."
If Gavin was as you describe him to be, there is no way he would give up control of core. Imagine if he hadn't and instead chose to implement a blocksize increase in core instead of XT. The small block devs would be forced to do what he did voluntarily and fork to "Bitcoin Limited" or something and would be in the position of making the case that core is on the wrong path. They would be in the same boat as Etherium Classic is now. The fact that he did not take advantage of his position to further his goals says a lot about Gavin.


What new knowledge exactly?
@_date: 2016-02-22 21:26:32
Here is some information on why some people believe 1.6MB is more accurate than 2MB. The TL:DR is that the vast majority of transactions today are standard single-signature P2PKH transactions, not multisig. All transactions would need to be 2/2 multsig to fit 2MB in 1MB and that's not going to happen.

Yes there are different predictions to the exact impact segwit will have on the number of transactions a 1MB will support. That is another argument and based on my research I believe the more conservative 1.6MB to be most accurate but that is not the point of my comment.
NOBODY is saying a 15/15 multisig transaction will save space over a single sig transaction. Your statement "Because you will save fees, the incentive will be there to perform these transactions." is 100% incorrect. People will save fees when their tx uses segwit compared to not using segwit, not when compared to using multisig. That is where your understanding of segwit is incorrect.

Miners most certainly set the "validity rules" as they do the work which creates the blockchain. Full nodes can increase the value of a blockchain which is the only influence they have over the consensus rules. They can't directly change the rules but they can influence a miner to change them.
Fundamentally, a blockchain's value is derived via the utility created by it's immutability. That immutability is created solely by miners who do the work. That is the root of everything.

@_date: 2011-05-20 22:39:32
The system already has a built-in auto-correct for something like that. It's not much different from the possibility of new computing technology being discovered that makes mining much easier. Think about the shift from CPU to GPU mining. It would correct the same way but in reverse. If suddenly cancer was cured then there would be less incentive to mine meaning less people mining meaning the difficulty decreases every 2 weeks until it's balanced again.
In addition, people already do folding for free, the only incentive is to cure cancer, nothing financial. If they were mining coins and trying to cure cancer as the same time, I doubt they would just stop and give up their coins because cancer is cured.
Edit: Also, what is to be gained is that the more incentive there is to mine, the more people will mine and the more secure the network will be, especially when there are only transaction fees to pay miners in the future.

The current lack of wallet security is going to effect the market whether it "shouldn't" or not. Right now if there was a new potential investor researching BitCoins, they will find the news of the $500k theft, news of the trojans, and learn about the security issue with wallet files and lack of recourse if your BTC are stolen. Is this potential investor going to feel their holdings will be safe if they decide to invest? Probably not unless they are savvy with encryption which is going to rule out a ton of investors. Until this issue is addressed, it is a factor...
@_date: 2011-08-23 03:17:14
I agree they "won't be inclined" but I doubt they will "unanimously refuse". Right now there's no way to even choose which transactions are included unless you run a modified client. I'm curious what the max number of transactions that can be included in a block is because if miners can chose which they include then technically even transactions with fees might never be confirmed if there's enough transactions with higher fees to chose from so I'm pretty sure they've accounted for this in the protocol but now I've gotta check it out :P

Why does the work have to be otherwise useless? If cancer is cured or alien communication is discovered, then the work just becomes "otherwise useless" just like it is right now.
Yes if mining has other uses then that increases the value of mining but I see that as a good thing. More incentive to mine means more miners means more secure network. Especially in the future when no more BC are generated and miners only have transaction fees as incentive to mine.

Anything is possible when you're talking about future changes to the network, but the current system as it is working right now has a hard limit to how much a BTC can be divided.

Nope, bitcoins really are divisible to 8 decimal places as advertised. Transaction fees are optional and in your example would just be rounded down to 0 instead of preventing somebody from transferring 0.00001 BTC. Technically there are 2.1 quadrillion units which are called "satoshies" (0.00000001 BTC). If a satoshi was worth one penny ($0.01) then that would be the equivalent of 21 trillion $ worth of BTC and in your example $567,567.59 for each person in CA. Plenty to go around.

You mean P2P poker has not yet been invented ;). The way I could see it working is that the "dealer" is actually a bunch of peers on the P2P network, not the players themselves. The pots would be raked which would pay the dealers which would create incentive to run nodes on the network. If you had dozens of random nodes doing the dealing, it would be pretty hard to purposefully mess up your own game. I don't see why it wouldn't be possible, just very tricky...

1&gt; That $300 price wouldn't last long as people rush to cash out as there wouldn't be any other $300 buyers.

I think it could even freak people out and cause a sell-off since it could look like it's crashing.
2&gt; Somebody investing $4.5mill would most likely go the ASICMiner route and fab their own hardware instead of buying from a risky vendor and would probably spend even less than $25/ghash.


I'd say it's a bit more complicated. GPU mining has been king for the past few years and while there were some moments where GPU's were hard to find, they've been pretty abundant that entire time. IMO the exchange rate is a much bigger factor since it of course is one of the biggest variables in mining profitability. For example, the network's speed actually decreased in 2011 when mining became unprofitable for many due to the low exchange rate at the time. That had nothing to do with availability. If BTC dropped to $5 tomorrow, there would be a lot less people considering investing in AISC miners because of the greatly increased time for ROI and if somebody started a $4.5 million mining op, that would also increase the time for ROI for everybody else which would discourage others from mining as well. Regardless, we're talking about a measly 6 weeks in my example so I'd say it's safe to say that in a worse cast scenario you could mine much more than 69k BTC before a $4.5mill mining operation become unproductive.
So yes I do agree it's not as simple as "buy 4.5mill in ASIC miners" but do you honestly believe that if you had $4.5 million to invest, you'd do so in one giant $65/BTC buy order? Chances are you'd try to buy them over time for &lt;$40 or invest in mining so I stand by my prediction that a 130k BTC sell is much MUCH more likely than a 69k BTC buy worth $4.5 million.
Right or wrong, I just LOVE talking about Bitcoins :D

Unfortunately a sorry isn't going to change the fact that you denied many requests for refunds during the last failed pre-sale. This new excuse that "you were too busy processing orders and being extorted to issue refunds" isn't much better than the previous "you submitted two support requests so the fee is justified" excuse. Refunding our fees is the only way to restore faith and good will towards your service...

AAAAAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA! By transparent you must mean claiming they will ship in "only a few more weeks" over and over for a year while their CEO behaves like a child when dealing with his understandably irate customers.
For a real world example, I pre-ordered miners from both Avalon and BFL at the exact same time in February. While a few months late, my Avalon's have now been running for over a month at 20+% their advertised hashrate. Meanwhile, my BFL pre-order (which I resold long ago) still has no sign of shipping any time soon as they still haven't caught up with their FIRST MONTH of pre-orders back in June of last year...
Yes Yifu really sucks at keeping his customers in the loop and there's pretty much no customer service but there's no comparison to Josh which has been a complete unmitigated disaster for 90% of their customers.

There is still quite a bit of uncertainty with bitcoin. It's close to impossible to predict the future exchange rate and mining difficulty isn't much easier to predict. I think most of the big investors are just buying BTC outright instead of getting involved with the uncertainty of mining because it's not for the faint of heart. IMO BTC is still way over priced and it's all based on speculation so to me it's more like gambling than investing at this point.
When KNC opened their pre-orders the exchange rate was still dropping towards the July low but it still looked like an amazing deal on paper. While the exchange rate has recovered from the July low, the difficulty has also increased a lot more than most estimates. Luckily KNC came through on their "under promise / over deliver" motto and bumped the hashrate up 66% so right now KNC miners will still have a positive ROI assuming exchange rate holds. Anybody with a pre-order has been on a roller coaster these last 4 months while they wait to see how the dice land. If the exchange rate crashes tomorrow then all KNC customers are shit out of luck. If it had crashed before they shipped then KNC would have been out of luck when everybody canceled their orders since they offered a refund up to the day your order went into production.
I really liked ASICminer's route where you just sell shares of a mine and everybody splits the profits. I'm glad the people that backed them early on did VERY well. The only problem of course is they had a pretty big chunk of the network but now they are selling hardware as well which mitigates that problem a lot.

64C is fine. Extreme temp changes can cause problems but you can run most GPU's at 80C 24/7 without problems. The other factor to consider is fan speed. Most GPU fans will have a reduced lifespan at higher RPM's.

What exactly is obvious? Since they accept Paypal and aren't doing pre-orders, how exactly could they scam since it would be pretty easy to get a refund if they don't ship.

I noticed some very odd patterns on Mt.Gox starting an hour ago.  It's now showing over 10 million BTC have been traded in the past few hours which I can't imagine is accurate. Is Mt.Gox glitching out or maybe an attempt at price manipulation?

It would take some major balls to invest that much when the price has already doubled in the last 6 weeks and only a year and a half ago lost 90% of it's value in just a few months and of course it would be much cheaper to mine them so that seems pretty unlikely IMO. Seems much much more likely that all of the early miners/investors are going to be looking to cash-out before the price crashes again.

Avalon batch  made an absolute FORTUNE. While late, batch  also did very well. KNC is shipping now and looks to make a positive ROI. Bitfury also turned out to be legit and I believe had positive ROI.
Pre-orders are unfortunately a necessary evil right now because few want to risk the money needed to bring an ASIC miner to market so the only way is to spread that risk to the miners that want them. I agree it's been pretty ugly with BFL, bASIC, etc but if you do your research you can raise the odds. Bitsyncom and ASICMiner both sell "off the shelf" ASIC miners but because of the auction format they are WAY over priced so I personally am going to keep looking for legit pre-orders who will share the rewards with the risk...

Unfortunately he hit the nail on the head. I've been waiting over 2 months for USD withdrawals to complete and their support can only tell me "blah blah blah 2 week backlog" and when I ask for an estimation all they can tell me is "soon". My only 2 options are to keep waiting and hope they aren't going under or take a 10-20% loss by converting back to BTC so I can transfer to another exchange. Until they fix withdrawals then Goxbucks are &lt; USD unfortunately.
Since other currencies are not having this problem I'm hoping they are having legit "banking issues" and will eventually work out this problem and resume withdrawals but I can't deny I'm pretty nervous about their future...

You made three different posts to about basically the same thing within 3-4 hours. It's obvious you're freak'n out because your magic money machine isn't working correctly and you are trying to light a fire to get their attention any way you can and honestly it's not going to help and if anything just add more noise...
They are probably busy sifting through the 100 e-mails some another guy like you sent about the same thing thinking that would somehow get them to fix their problem faster which in reality just adds more work and makes it harder to prioritize their efforts. They aren't just sitting around wacking-off ignoring everybody's problems. All you can do is send an e-mail, post/contribute on the forum, and wait.
@_date: 2013-03-02 01:47:49
Right now a 69k BTC buy would cost almost 4.5 million USD. That's almost $65/BTC!
So using the Avalon as an example, current ASIC miner costs run ~$25/ghash. $4.5 million would buy 180thash! That means if the network hash-rate increased 600% by the time you started mining, you'd still have 50% of the network total which would mine 69k in less than 6 weeks.
Maybe my math is wrong but I'd saying investing $4.5 million in mining is going to net A LOT more than 69k BTC IMO...
@_date: 2013-03-02 02:10:05


How are you measuring demand exactly? I know you can't use market volume to gauge demand but last month's volume on MTGox(USD) was less than 40k BTC but a year ago it was over 44k BTC so there's actually been LESS trading in the last month than a year ago in that example.

The market cap was HALF that only 6 weeks ago and right now it would take less than $1mill USD to buy the price up to over $40USD/BTC so it's not a very deep market.

Wow I didn't notice that. I wonder exactly how much they made off that pre-order fiasco since I doubt we're the only two people to make that mistake. When dealing with their "customer service" it was quickly obvious what kind of company they are.
@_date: 2013-03-02 00:50:44


How about it? Yes the price is high because there is more demand than supply but what I am pondering is WHY there is a high demand and yes I considered the cause being new investors but thanks for that. Considering that the price has doubled in less than 6 weeks and is still climbing I feel there must be more going on than a bunch of new investors willing to spend TWICE what they would have 2 months ago...
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:10:18
I'm not going to read them all but in the second one the guys says "Well its not like mine is dysfunctional it's hashing at 140 Gh/s for my murcury, so it's just mainly annoying".
Almost every single one of those posts are less than 24 hours old and these forums are for community support, not direct KNC support. If you want direct support email support and check the forums while you wait or try calling them.
Yes I know how frustrating it when your magic monkey making machine isn't working but trying to drum up some heat on them is not going to help you. I've ordered miners from 3 different ASIC manufactures and I can promise you KNC is doing MUCH MUCH better by an order of magnitude compared to the others when supporting their customers. Just take a deep breath and keep researching on the forums...

If anybody wonders if this is an actual "shitstorm" please go check the forum directly (it's not):
Time is money when bringing a bitcoin miner to market and they brought a 28nm ASIC to market in a little over 4 months where there is simply no time to do normal QA. The community is providing a lot of support if you actually look at the threads which is the purpose of these forums. Sure there are a few people that will go ballistic who are the sames ones that rage all over the forums when their Sony TV arrives dead. I personally am amazed with their results and the increase in network hashrate speaks for itself...
@_date: 2013-02-18 05:45:56
IMO there's not a lot of math to do when the majority of the variables are very unpredictable. It's pretty much a gamble. The BTC market itself is still very unpredictable so who knows what the price will be down the road. There's no way to really know when and IF any of these ASIC miners will actually ship and begin mining and increasing the total network hash-rate. So yeah do your math but you'd probably have better luck crossing your fingers :P. My hope is that I can at the very least recoup my investment in a year...
