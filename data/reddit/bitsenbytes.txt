if you logged onto multibit and your "wallet" was offline, on a different machine, usb drive, or external hard drive, and was not accessible, then yes multibit will create a new empty wallet. 
If this happened to you then you need to, shutdown multibit, delete the empty wallet, or better, just rename it, and then drop your original wallet in place and restart multibit.
@_date: 2015-06-26 02:36:38
You can download all kinds of wallets, electrum and multibit are quite popular for PC use.  For use on your phone there is mycelium which is popular but there are others.  Then you need to buy some coin either from an exchange, bitcoin atm, or someone who has some.

upgrading to XT will help to make your vote heard...more and more nodes are switching to XT to say something tangible about what needs to be done.  But nothing will happen until the next release of XT or unless the Core group finally makes a decision to up the block size.

A fine example of a conceited young man with an over inflated sense of himself, having done little and riding on the coat tails of a great inventor.  
 I've come across this type on occasion in my years in IT.  I would not hire this kind of person or have him on my team.  I'm sure many of the other developers are keen, smart, humble young boys and girls, wanting to figure out what to do next in the best way, but this is not one of them.

Even you have just one connection your node is relaying transactions and blocks.  It doesn't matter whether in coming our outgoing.
You also don't need to port forward.  Upnp is on by default.  Port forwarding gives  you a very small performance boost.  I never bother with it anymore.  But if you want to run with two or more nodes on your network then you do need port forwarding.
@_date: 2015-06-11 07:17:35
only if you have turned on "allow incoming connections" ...what that does is allow other nodes to connect to you and download blocks from you.  if you don't have that turned on then you are just running a client with a full blockchain.

@_date: 2015-12-16 15:27:21
That's a great observation.  Anybody who is new and looks at that wallet is wondering if their node is actually doing anything.  There should be a small area with stats for tx's, blocks, connections that continually updates every minute or so rather than having to find the debug window.
@_date: 2015-06-11 18:21:35
just in case there's any confusion, with something like "changetip", you can send less than the "dust" limit because they're an off chain business...but anything on chain needs to be above the "dust" limit.

what version of QT are you running, do you have the latest 10.2.  There is a monitoring tab which shows you a few things like network traffic and number and type of connections (in/out).  You can find it under the menu.  I'm away from home at the moment and don't remember the name of the menu item, you'll have to poke around a little.

I started a node last week as well.  Seems that the node number for XT is steadily rising...last week there were about 70 , now almost 100.
@_date: 2015-06-11 17:41:52
one other thing , I'm not sure you can send 200 satoshi, I believe that's below the "dust" threshold...somewhere around mid 500's...you'd have to be at least 600 satoshi I think before the transaction would be included in a block.

Nice post.
It seems that the miners want to increase block sizes when they understand that they can, even in China where some say they are against it because of bandwidth/latency issues.
In addition, I wonder if any miners have reduced their block sizes when they found out they can???

Are you running on windows.  I think there's a bug in the windows version that can corrupt the database when you shutdown the client.
You might want to try reindexing the blockchain or reinstalling the blockchain but use the same wallet, OR try to export your private keys and import them into a different wallet such as multibit.

I suppose it's a roundabout way of seeing what motivates the miners.  It seems they want larger block sizes when they understand that they can have them.  Even in China, where supposedly they bandwidth/latency issues and would fear having more orphans.

If they're running a real ETF then they have to have a place to buy and sell BTC to keep the price of the ETF in line with the price of BTC. Just like the gold ETF "GLD"  buys and sells gold as people buy and sell their ETF shares.  It's more difficult to manage than a fund like GBTC.  With the ETF the amount of BTC held will fluctuate and so they need a reliable market to trade in such as their very own exchange that they have control over.

Whoever created it the "genesis" block was most likely somebody living in , from, or visiting England at the time. If he was American then he probably would have used a headline to embed from the New York Times and not the British newspaper "The Times".  Sorry, not everything revolves around America.
 From the book mastering bitcoin:
"The genesis block contains a hidden message within it. The coinbase transaction input
contains the text “The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for
banks.” This message was intended to offer proof of the earliest date this block was
created, by referencing the headline of the British newspaper The Times."

Front running is only possible IF, the miner is the one who was able to mine the block...that's something that can't be predicted.  But true, if the miner can mine the block then they could theoretically front run the order.

why not just add coinjoin functionality to bitcoin?  each bitcoin node could run in a coinjoin mode that would allow for coin mixing, and it would also incentivize node runners since they could collect small fees for their coin mixing services.
@_date: 2015-06-29 14:15:34
This is a much needed functionality, although it won't get used unless blocks get full.  Of course what we also need is larger blocks, coupled with this new ability to change your fee to a higher one if needed and when/if the network gets too busy.  I doubt very much it will get used much but it's a good "to have" in case the network is attacked/spammed or backs up under heavy loads.

It's very easy to do network packet filtering without the need to block any ports or IP addresses.  Any bitcoin traffic can be blocked using ALF network filtering.
At some point, the bitcoin protocol may want to be totally encrypted.  Right now, we can see and decode the packets very easily which allows this type of filtering to work.
@_date: 2015-06-24 23:55:00
I doubt that very much.  I've done performance testing for major US corporations as well as the Stock Exchange for the last 20 years.   The only thing they may do is shut down production for a few hours and bring the production system back up pointing to a test database.  We did that occasionally at the stock exchange on weekends because there was no full backup test system to play on.  
But it's basically a  cardinal rule not to test in production.  The only people that think it's Ok and can't understand it are oddly the developers.  They're great at coding but generally not good at understanding the risks of performance testing.  
@_date: 2015-06-17 11:24:34

28 days is not enough of a sample space.  Go back a few years instead, and also look at block size as well, because number of transactions does not necessarily mean a linear increase in block size because individual transactions can be smaller or larger.

Bitcoin as money is just the tip of the iceberg.  This blockchain technology is really about record keeping: The Ledger.  Any kind of record's proof of existence can be kept, unalterable, on the blockchain.  That's what bitcoin really is, a decentralized record keeping system. Your bitcoins can be thought of as ownership (like a stock or share) of a piece of that ledger system that you can trade like money.

Also makes me laugh a little that they try to divorce the blockchain from bitcoin but they can't really pull it off because as we know Bitcoin is THE blockchain.

Well that is just totally ridiculous.  I wasn't getting any incoming connections all day on XT.

Then I switch to Bitcoin Core and suddenly I'm getting inbound connections.  So I switch back to XT and now I am getting inbound connections there again.  You might want to try doing this as well, as bizarre as it sounds.  Try running Core and see if you get connections then go back to XT.

Basically it's a method of dataset reconciliation.  Just a term to describe syncing data between two nodes.  Or in this case, what am I missing (which transactions) on my node to be able to construct a block.  Since most of the transactions to build the block are already in my memory pool, I just need to get the transactions that are missing, maybe one or two rather than download the whole block.

you're willing to take that risk?
I've done performance and scalability testing for 20 years.  What I've seen is when systems reach capacity they fail either catastrophically or they limp along in degraded mode.  Take your pick, nobody knows  which one will happen since part of the problem is trying to figure out how people will respond when they hear there are problems with bitcoin.  Will they all try to bail out and end up increasing the transaction rate further causing more problems? or will people just hang in there?

You have stop trying to think of bits of data or information having some sort of value.  The ledger entries themselves are not where the value resides.  The reason Bitcoin's have value is not because they are money.  Bitcoin is much more than a currency, it's value lies in the entire system of record keeping.  And what each Bitcoin represents in effect is a share (just like a stock in a company) of that World Wide Ledger.  You have ownership (a non voting share) in that Ledger.  And that's what you are trading when you spend your bitcoins, a small piece of that ledger system that you own.

I would think a great deal of transactions are already being done off chain through changtip, online gambling sites etc...but still the blockchain needs a bigger block size long term.  Setting it at 20Mb or some other number just means we'll have to make another hard fork later. We need a system that can gradually change over time such as the settings for "difficulty" already change every 10 minutes. It should be easy enough to code in a block size change based on some statistical average over maybe the last month or two,with maybe a 20 or 30% extra size, and have the system update every day. That way, as block size needs gradually grow, we have a block size that also grows, with a little extra to accommodate unexpected surges in activity.  And we don't have to hard fork again at a later date!

the block reward is 25 BTC , but the miners also get the bitcoin fee's for any bitcoin sent on chain.  The fee's vary as well as the number of transactions and so it's never the same but always more than 25.
@_date: 2015-05-30 22:13:04
Yes they can , but with the hard limit of 1mb in the Bitcon Core software, it doesn't help anyone.  If the hard limit in the Core software were removed then the miners  can set whatever limit they wish and it would be valid, but right now they can only set it somewhere less than 1mb...currently most of them set it to 730Kb,  the default.

Currently miners don't need fees to make money, they get most of their money from mining blocks.  But what IS very important is that Bitcoin can scale and allow for a greater adoption.  Maybe in 10 or 20 years fees might be and issue?  I doubt it, but it certainly doesn't matter today.

you said :  "A static max block size is also a security measure. Suppose that 10% of the nodes are known to be running on computers that have only 8 GB of memory and no swap memory. Then a malicious miner with (say) 1% of the total hashpower could try to mine blocks with 9 GB of bogus transactions. After about 100 trials he will succeed. Then those 10% of the nodes will crash, while the other 90% will acept the 9GB block as valid. From then on, those 10% will be permanently unable to process the blockchain, unless their memory is physically expanded."
Yes, this could theoretically happen but it would be only temporary...a miner doing this would be wasting his time and efforts to be able to drop a few other miners.  Once they are dropped it just becomes more economically feasible to get involved in mining, thus increasing the mining pool again.  It would be a temporary attack with temporary results...Market forces would prevail.

I have to agree, at current levels we're already using up nearly half the available size but if/when Bitcoin prices start surging, the transaction rates, looking at past data, typically double or more for quite a number of weeks during these strong price rallies.

You have to have some capital to do that.  
1)  You need to have the GBTC shares
2)  You need an account at a bitcoin exchange with money already in there.

From what I understand, XT will relay that someone is trying to double spend some coin.   Sounds like a good thing to me and actually means we don't need to worry about confirmation times as much because we would be alerted to the fact that a double spend is occurring when it happens.  Currently double spends just get dropped from the system without anybody being alerted.

You can think of the XT client as just another client.  It will use the same block information so you don't have to re-download the blockchain but if you want to use the client then of course you have to send you coins to it.

There will be black stain that the world will not easily forget.
And why shouldn't "everybody and their mother use"  bitcoin as you said.  Sounds a bit elitist to exclude most of the world and just reserve bitcoin for the "big ass" payments.  Any government can create their own coin if they want for those big-ass transfers but bitcoin is about decentralization. Trying to monkey with miners fees, smells very much like government central planning to me, distorting the market place so some small group benefits, rather than opening up the market and allowing all to participate.  The miners will mine if their are profits to be made, and when they can't profit some will drop out and leave the profits for the remainders.

 You said, "To use bitcoin you had to set up a wallet and you are now ALWAYS 100% in charge of your own security". 
Somewhat true, people are always giving up their freedom for a false sense of security.  When you give up your freedom for security you end up with neither...It was Benjamin Franklin that said that.
And besides, their are exchanges now that insure your deposits.  It's going to be coming everywhere, just a matter of time.  Even so, I'm finding using bitcoin in most cases the preferable route.  It's hard to explain to someone if you haven't used it.  You should try it sometime...

Everything in the world requires energy.  How much energy does it take to get out of bed in the morning.  If people didn't get out of bed we could save a lot on heating costs, food, water etc.  It's of course a lot of socialized, central planning nonsense.  Only the market determines how much energy can be used by miners.  If energy costs are too high then they can't mine but other more efficient miners can.

The problem with custodial services is the same as always, "is the gold really there in the vault when you need it". Western gold bullion banks are notorious for running re-hypothecation schemes, or in short a type of fractional reserve bullion bank.  All the gold isn't there but has been partially lent out.  If there's some kind of financial meltdown and time comes to get your gold you may find that you only get half or less back because the IOU's that the bullion bank holds on the gold lent out can't be collected on because the financial institution owing the gold has gone bust. 
 It's estimated by some that more than 50 to 90% of the gold has been lent out in this way and many who claim there is very little gold left in Fort Knox!   Remember when there was a drive to count the gold reserves at Fort Knox a few years back and there was so much push back that the matter was dropped, all because it would cost 15 million dollars to count it.  When was a politician ever concerned about 15 million dollars, they spend that every 30 seconds in the USA (actally every  25 seconds)!
Buy gold and keep it in your hands if you can, at least some of it.  Stay away from ETF's like GLD and SLV but if you want a good fund you might try CEF.A in Canada, they do regular inspections of their gold/silver by a third party.  But still, you need some gold under your own control.
Bitcoin and Gold is a powerful combination.  Gold for hard savings and Bitcoin for spending...

It's a bit of an odd case so I'll go through it step by step.
Lets start with the definition of arbitrage...
"The simultaneous purchase and sale of an asset in order to profit from a difference in the price. . Arbitrage exists as a result of market inefficiencies; it provides a mechanism to ensure prices do not deviate substantially from fair value for long periods of time."
It is a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms
Now in this particular case it's not a simple straightforward arbitrage, you have two instruments that are similar but not identical.  Furthermore the difficulty is compounded by the fact that they trade on different exchanges and further to that one can not "Short" the GBTC shares, at least not that I'm aware of.
So, in order to do the arbitrage, you must already be a "current" GBTC shareholder (one that bought in from the beginning), and you must already have a Bitcoin trading account at some Bitcoin exchange with money "already" deposited in the amount of GBTC that you intend to sell.
You have to have some capital to do that. Not many people are in the position to do this but as news filters out original GBTC holders may want to avail themselves of the opportunity until price differentials presumably narrow.
1) You need to have the GBTC shares 
2) You need an account at a bitcoin exchange with money already in there.
So all you do then is sell your GBTC shares for argument say $400, and then buy an equivalent amount of BTC at your bitcoin exchange, at a lower price such as the current $235. You've made, or freed up, $165 per bitcoin that you wouldn't have had. You can now use that money to buy more bitcoin if you wanted to. So if you started with 100 BTC (1000 GBTC), you would now have 170.2 BTC.  So the trader has accumulated and additional 70.2 bitcoins in this simple conversion which I believe satisfies the definition of arbitrage, "a trade that profits by exploiting price differences of identical or similar financial instruments, on different markets or in different forms".
But it's a one time only arbitrage.  Once the original owner has sold their shares they can't "do it again" for the fact that one can not short sell GBTC.

Very good point and the 20Mb will buy time, with 140 tps then possible and all the off chain activity that 140 tps rate can be significantly higher, maybe as high as 10 or 20 times more?  I don't know, just guessing...It may be also that as time goes, and more merchants feel comfortable holding bitcoin rather than changing into fiat, people start doing more "on chain" transactions, then we'll hit the 140 much sooner but again at least it buys time and the changes will be more easily adopted.  Remember, just because Gavin makes a change it doesn't mean it will be adopted , it has to be palatable to the majority!

Nothing stopping them but bitcoin isn't just a blockchain, it's also a network or miners.

In this article it states.
 "1MB blocks will always outrun the 20MB blocks, thus orphaning any miners who decide to mine 20MB blocks".
This is only true in the specific case when two miners discover a block at the exact same time and which doesn't happen that often.  Once miners start mining for 20Mb blocks , those blocks will be created very quickly.

potentially damaging to whom? Miners would not mine/generate a block that was too big for them to create...they know what their own hardware limits are.

Miners that set their own block size limits have an effect that is no different than having a hard limit in the code. So, since miners already set their limits, as we've seen, and they will determine whether their hardware can handle those limits, then why do we need a "redundant, arbitrary" hard limit programmed into the software that requires hard forking every so often?

Of course non-mining nodes care about latency.  P2p scaling is very important...if a block can not propagate within a short period of time on the p2p network then there is little point in raising the block size.  Xthins take just 1 second to download and validate a full block, which means in 5 to 10 seconds it can propagate to the entire p2p network.  Of course that is important for scaling and although it's good that bandwidth is reduced, bandwidth is only a side issue.

what else is new...
@_date: 2016-03-14 22:59:58
Patrick Strateman recently posted a youtube video (  ) showing how slow block propagation currently is.  I have seen it for myself sometimes take 2 minutes.  That doesn't look very good to me.  Now Xtreme Thinblocks takes just a second to move the block and just another tenth of a second to validate, so maybe it's taking roughly 5 to 10 seconds to propagate a full block to every node. So that means we've basically propagated a full block to every node before almost any node would have received and validated a single "normal block", based on Patrick's presentation.  So what's wrong with that?  Isn't that a good thing?  Why not use it for p2p when Core devs have clearly shown how poor p2p is currently handling 1MB blocks?  I don't understand the mentality of -blocksonly since it clearly doesn't solve the issues with block propagation.

Of course latency matters for a non-mining node.  If it didn't matter then why isn't the block size 100MB, since you have the Relay Network which does not validate but only sends the block header with some tx hashes it shouldn't then matter, but the fact is, it does.  Latency over p2p is important...if a block can not propagate and validate before the next block is mined then p2p breaks down.  Fast relay over p2p is a crucial element of the entire system, not the only element, but a crucial one nevertheless.

500 bits @_date: 2015-05-27 23:20:44
yes excellent post...I was just thinking about this in regards to the block size debate and that this situation you describe would effect any block size. 
And it's why block size cap is not important.  We should not artificially be capping block size, it's up to the miners to do and which they already can.  
Aside from that there is nothing from stopping anybody from flooding the network.  
There needs to be a mechanism to counter this kind of attack , such as, if the miners do not accept transactions within a certain amount of time that they will go "stale" and get cancelled with the money returning to the sender.  But I really don't know if it's possible to code such a mechanism into bitcoin...

That is true.  The unfortunate outcome of all these spammy transactions in the mempool and blocks that are too small.  If the mempool were being recycled every block or so we wouldn't see this and our bloom filters would be around 3KB or so.  However, we are working on "Targeted" Bloom filters and it appears it is working well so that regardless of mempool size our filters are always small in the 3 to 5KB range.  Still a work in progress  but may be out in  point release very soon.
@_date: 2016-06-06 21:00:02


Am I mistaken or didn't you all discuss using a bloom filter at the Zurich meeting to sync the mempool after each block so that Compact Blocks would work well?  It's in the meeting minutes.
 
@_date: 2016-06-06 17:13:14
No that's not how Xthin's work.  Firslty, xthin's is meant for p2p relay. Not for the miners.  So that attack here would be pointless.  Secondly if they bothered to do such an attack all we would do is re-request a thinblock with the full tx hashes...so instead of getting 96% compression we will get about 92 or 93%...it seems a very weak attack IMO.
@_date: 2016-06-06 20:47:02
don't worry we won't blame you...BU will not currently have any problems handling that scenario.  BU is not a mining node right now...it's just being used for p2p and under that scenario we just request a thinblock with the full tx hash...there is no danger for us.   In the future when xpedited is in place then yes, we'll need to salt the tx hases..ok so ?

As far as governance is concerned, the less, governing (or government) the better.  Government, like votes, can be bought.  Bitcoin has done pretty good over the years, bringing in new functionality as needed.  The only place it has gotten "hung up" is with the blocksize debate.  I don't think that's reason enough to bring in a new governing body.
However, that said,
Bitcoin does need a better development process for introducing change, such as requirements gathering from the business community.  There is a lack of sitting down with the stakeholders and finding out what they really would like to see and then documenting and discussing it with the Bitcoin dev team.  It doesn't mean the stakeholders will be running Bitcoin...Bitcoin should maintain it's "sovereignty" at all costs but nothing wrong with sitting down "face to face" and documenting what the needs really are.   
@_date: 2015-08-03 16:18:35
What you're describing is how privacy breaks down when you send a transaction that merges two addresses.  if you spent from address A and your personal info is tied to that address, then an entity (such as government) will be able to know that you also were in control of address B.  You can get around that by using the coin control feature in Bitcoin Core and ensure that you're just sending coins from the address you want to send from.
Edit--&gt;  just came across this post from satoshi on bitcointalk.org about privacy and addresses...worth a read
 
 
Re: Repost: How anonymous are bitcoins? 
November 25, 2009, 06:17:23 PM 
Reply with quote   
 &gt; Can nodes on the network tell from which and or to which bitcoin 




Bitcoins are sent to and from bitcoin addresses, which are essentially random numbers with no identifying information.
When you send to an IP address, the transaction is still written to a bitcoin address.  The IP address is only used to connect to the recipient's computer to request a fresh bitcoin address, give the transaction directly to the recipient and get a confirmation. 
Blocks contain a history of the bitcoin addresses that a coin has been transferred to.  If the identities of the people using the bitcoin addresses are not known and each address is used only once, then this information only reveals that some unknown person transferred some amount to someone else.
The possibility to be anonymous or pseudonymous relies on you not revealing any identifying information about yourself in connection with the bitcoin addresses you use.  If you post your bitcoin address on the web, then you're associating that address and any transactions with it with the name you posted under.  If you posted under a handle that you haven't associated with your real identity, then you're still pseudonymous.

We'll see where BIP 100 can go. In the beginning, when it first came out, I thought it was a well balanced compromise between the Core Devs, and XT. But there are a couple of lingering questions that remain, and as BIP 100 gets more press, will have to be answered.
1) Where is the code, so far nothing has been produced except a BIP document?
2) And this one for me is the most troublesome. What is to prevent a powerful entity from bribing any miner for voting a particular way? Maybe it is happening already? Maybe the Chinese government is forcing these miners to vote a particular way? How do we know? How do we know it won't happen in the future in order to destroy Bitcoin or cripple it? Something smells somewhere and makes me uneasy a the prospect of a small group of miners, motivated by self interest, to decide the future of Bitcoin.

I don't agree that posts about XT should be removed. I will not remove posts about XT from this subverse, what ever someone thinks about XT, it will have a substantial impact on Bitcoin and is thus relevant to this subverse.
Any software that has a direct effect on or attempts to change Bitcoin is on topic IMO and should be discussed.

Maybe you should start with yourself and think  about why you want to impose your views on everyone instead of just moderating discussions?   Is it because you believe so much in your own personal cause?  You are a typical authoritarian, you just don't think of yourself that way because you're probably a pretty decent guy in day to day life.  But give someone a little power and what do they do? Impose their ideas on the masses because they believe they think they know the issues better than everyone...secretly they believe themselves superior in knowledge and intelligence.  Sound familiar?

If you just want to run the wallet then there's nothing you need or can do, if you want to run a full node then you have to select the "allow incoming connections" check box found in the menu.
Then you can limit the number of incoming connections.  The default is 125 but I find this too much for my laptop so I limit it to about 25.  You can create a "bitcoin.conf" file...there should already be one...add the following line to the file and restart the application. Reducing incoming connections will throttle the outgoing bandwidth.

@_date: 2015-07-07 12:28:24
I was just thinking about that last night.  They could send all these spam transactions.  Maybe cost them 10 Bitcoins.  Now the transactions fees have about doubled and tripled per block...they are now getting almost .75 BTC per bloc rather than .25...that's a lot of extra money in one day.  144 blocs a day is an extra 72 BTC dirstributed among the miners for a 10 BTC investment.  
I'm not saying this is happening but we've already seen with the BIP66 issue that the miners are doing whatever it takes to get bigger profits even if it may cause temporary problems.

Any coins you hold pre-fork are still spendable on either side of the fork.  After the fork, newly minted coins can only be spent on the fork they were mined on.   
A fork does not mean a new coin - lol...Bitcoin forks several times a day - that's when blocks get orphaned.

I don't know...I'm just asking the question and sharing my thoughts.  Maybe BIP 100 will work and be fine.  I just think it needs to be vetted a little more before jumping in.
The one thing I do like about it though is that it's a permanent solution. It will never require another hard fork again, so that's a big plus in my book, however, I still have nagging doubts but it doesn't mean I'm right..

right now forwarding of blocks is not supported when in "pruning" mode but I believe transactions are still forwarded.  So you're really running as a "half" node when in pruning mode.  I later releases new blocks will also be forwarded when in pruning mode.

Bitcoin forks all the time, it's just that the forks are usually resolved in 1 block not 3 or 6...but they do get resolved.  The forks get orphaned off the main chain eventually.  At some point the miners will likely realize it's not worth the money to "not" check anymore like it used to be ...losses will mount and the last of the miners will start doing the correct checking of mined blocks. 
Market forces will prevail and miners will have to adapt.
@_date: 2015-07-13 04:59:04
the way the minrelaytxfee works is that anything below that value is considered a zero fee transaction.  Zero fee transactions can still be relayed but only up to the "limitfreerelay" amount which sets the KB per minute allowed for zero fee transactions.  So in short, it won't stop transactions from going through that are less than .00005, unless there are many of them, such as in a zero fee spam attack, which we've seen repeatedly this week. 
But no it won't stop all spam attacks, but at least slow them down, and also make the spammer "pay" for his attack rather than filling up the mem pool with zero fee transactions and cause the nodes to use up a great deal of bandwidth relaying them.

When I was much younger I used to input data for the traders on the floor of the Toronto Stock Exchange (when they had a floor) and I used to hear one trader say often "Don't sell a quiet market short".  It was at that point that I witnessed the birth of the biggest stock market run in history...that was around 1992 I believe.  The newspapers were full of articles about how the market was set to crash, the trading floor was unbelievably still that day I remember.  The ticker slowly declined and approached the number everybody was looking for, it gently passed through and there was a slight uptick in selling, I remember someone yelling out "sell 100,000 LAC at an eighth". And that was it, the market started turning around, slowly at first, but kept climbing, and never looked back.   
Quiet markets after long declines are preludes to something big, and Bitcoin looks like it's just breaking out of the doldrums!

The string that you see in your bitcoin client is your "address"...that string is not what unlocks your coins.  
Inside your wallet there is another "private" set of strings that can't be seen and are encrypted (if you set a password for your wallet)...that's the string that is used to unlock the coins once they are sent to your address.  Nobody can get access to those strings (we call them keys) unless you give someone your wallet and don't encrypt(make a password) for your wallet.

Block propagation takes about 5 seconds to reach 50% of the nodes and about 50 seconds to reach 90% of the nodes.  So ideally you really can't go less than 60 seconds, at current block sizes, to make sure everybody has the block before the next block is found and sent out.  And , I'm not sure it's a good idea to be sending out new blocks before most others have received the previous one.  
If block sizes get suddenly bigger then they will take longer to propagate.  10 minutes is a pretty conservative guesstimate by Satoshi to ensure that the network doesn't start stepping all over itself.  I don't think we really don't know enough about how bitcoin is going to scale or what network speeds are going to be in the next few years, to start tweaking that number.  Perhaps in 3 or 5 years we'll know better where to put that number.  
For now, ideally, I don't think anybody would argue that having a very short confirmation time would be great for bitcoin, but getting there safely is another matter.

Bitcoin has hit a very tough area to get through and is doing a small pullback.  It has to get through the $270 area to break through the upper line of the downtrend channel which started a year and a half ago.  This is it, if bitcoin can breach the $270 area with some decent follow through to $300 then we're off to the races, if it can't then we may end up going all the way down to the lower end of the channel (currently around $100)...nobody knows, time will tell.

That's actually a good point.  the way the minrelaytxfee works is that anything below that value is considered a zero fee transaction.  Zero fee transactions can still be relayed but only up to the "limitfreerelay" amount which sets the KB per minute allowed for zero fee transactions.  So in short, it won't stop transactions from going through that are less than .00005, unless there are many of them, such as in a spam attack.

After BIP66 was implemented, a miner mined a V2 block instead of V3, The next miner didn't check that the block was valid and started mining on top of that...6 blocks were forked and mined over the invalid V2 block before the valid chain caught up.  The issue is resolved and all invalid blocks were orphaned and everything is ok now...If you had some very large transactions going through at the time you might want to wait for 30 confirmations just to be sure but basically everything is back to normal.

Once one address in a wallet is discovered it's possible in most cases to link all the addresses together, even if you use a different address each time.  The problem lies with the UTXO, or the change you receive when you send bitcoin to someone from address A.  That change will get sent to a new address, B,  in your wallet and that change is linked, through the blockchain, to your old address, A. Now if you spend more coin, the new address B may, depending on the amount you send, get combined with some other address C, or multiple addresses.  Now those other addresses  C are linked to your very first address A through the change address, B
The only way to be private is, to always send amounts to new addresses, and spend only from those addresses the amount you sent in or less, and never spending the change in an amount that is greater than itself.  To do this can be awkward, as you would need to use the coin control feature and never combine change amounts, or export each private key and re-import into a new wallet separately.
It would be all much easier if you, used a new wallet with a new address for each transaction and not just a new address.  But still you would never be able to combine the last bit of change from any of those wallets with any other output.  You would in the end have to give that last bit of change away, from each wallet, and perhaps donate it to a charity.

Part of it is there already, you can send bitcoin by email, or SMS or Skype, etc but they still have to set something up a wallet or changetip account.

the funds will end up in the restaurant's wallet almost immediately but it won't be confirmed.  That's good enough for most people if you talking about a small amount of money such as a meal, coffee etc...that's called Zero Confirmation acceptance.  On the other hand, if you were buying a Picasso painting for 50 million then the seller would want to wait, probably for more than 6, and maybe 30 or more confirmations before accepting the order as paid.

That's what we do...we're just sending the first 64bits...work is underway to start using 32bit until we get collisions then up it to 40bit then 48 etc.  But that's for a later release.  That should give us a 150 to 200 compression ratio on average.  Then comes datastream compression which will add a little bit more, 20 or 30 percent extra.
@_date: 2015-07-14 16:31:18
yes that's true but it's actually part of the answer...they're not mining for the most part empty blocks...you see them mining an occasional empty block but mostly they are "smaller" blocks but probably caused for the same reasons you outlined.  They're only including the transactions they know came in from the time the previous block was found, but not having received the previous block yet and not knowing what transaction were included in that block, they can only include transactions they have received from the time the previous block header was received.
All this to say finally that having a 1Mb block size maximum really doesn't allow for a full 1Mb to be used during heavy periods of stress due to the SPV mining going on.  The reality is only 75% of the max blocksize on average can realistically be used and counted on for calculating maximum throughput.  
So theoretically speaking, if the blocksizes were raised to 8Mb, and SPV mining were still continuing, then there would realistically be only an average of 6Mb per block generated over time or roughly 75% of the max blocksize.

The problem is related to mempool sync and all the spam that is on the network right now.  It's taking 12 to 24 hours for the mempools to get closer in sync.

when you send someone a coin, your private key still works for your address but there are no coins in it, the coins are sent to someone else's address and they have their own private key for that address.  It's like saying you have a key to a lock box, you open the box take out the money and put it in your friends box.  You still have your key to your box but it's empty. Your friend has a different box with a different key and now has the money.
Perhaps a closer analogy still is the concept of signing a check.  That's more like what is happening in the code.  So your signature is your private key.  Your public key is your Check.  You fill in how much money you want sent and then sign the check (sign your transaction with your private key)...your friend can then cash the check , but only the amount specified on the check and therefore not all the money in your account and your private key is still private and cannot be forged to make another check.

On the blockchain which is distributed around the world on about 6000 nodes right now.  anyone can take part in running a node and contributing to the network.  The whole idea is that it's decentralized so that no person or government or big business has control over it, and yet it's immutable, meaning that the records can not be tampered with, or faked like you could in any bank for instance.  In a bank the records can be changed if you have access to the database, but not in the blockchain.  So that's what so great, it's decentralized and immutable, safe from prying and deceptive hands.

There is no such thing as fundamental value.  Everything in markets is subjective and depends only on what people are willing to pay.  Supply and demand and of course a good dose of "hope, fear, greed".   
All I'm saying with the chart is that the drop in price is not really that big or relevant when plotted on a log scale.  Don't focus on the day to day, week to week, the road ahead is long - 5, 10, 15 years of growth in a very nascent industry.  This is like the beginning of personal computers...I was there at the beginning and I remember people saying, "what in the world do we need home computers for, you can't do anything with them except play crappy video games".

Bitcoin has a long way to go before the public gets involved in a big way. That's a good thing for people concerned about price. Speaking as a long time "trader", you never see the top of a market until the general public starts getting involved. And as an aside, looking at the Bitcoin chart, plotted logarithmically, which every trader should be doing, the price is building a very solid and large base. "The bigger the base, the bigger they shoot into space", goes the saying. But it takes time, lots of ups and downs, could be another year of sideways movement or more, or less, nobody knows. Just keep buying a little on the big dips and be patient. 
In the meantime, go and have a starbucks for %20 off using some bitcoin...support the ecosystem, have a coffee and relax.

As with everything price will rise when there are more sellers to buyers.  There has to be a reason for a person to hold bitcoin in their wallet other than wanting the price to go up.  Such as, buying starbucks coffee at 20% off...
I'm finding with foldapp that I want to have more bits in my wallet so I can take advantage of the discount...as more and more people need to hold bitcoin the price will naturally rise but we haven't gotten there yet.  Sellers abound and are selling into the strong hands right now.

try it out, it's easy...just go to their site and load the card, it will open a send request from you wallet automagically...then you press the send and fund your card...just takes a couple of steps but really easy.  once you've  finished you can send any amount leftover back to your wallet if you want.

Yes this is really happening.  The banksters are slowly but surely limiting our options when it comes to access to our own cash. Their goal is to have all our "fiat" in a bank account that they can have  total control over and can't "bail-in" deposits whenever they choose.  
Start preparing yourself and assuring your financial freedom: Buy Gold, Silver and Bitcoin on pullbacks and keep them stored outside the banking system.

A truly random number can't be created by a computer, you need a "quantum device".  Fortunately almost everybody carries a quantum device these days "your cell phone camera".  I believe there's an app out there that hooks into your camera and detects the random photon activity in order to create random numbers.  I haven't tried it but would like to hear from someone out there who has?

I have an anal retentive issue with exchanges that don't allow you to trade with the full number of satoshi's.  I used to be a user of Cavirtex, and I hated that you had to buy bitcoin like this.  You could only buy 1.2109  you couldn't buy 1.21090992...drives me crazy and now that their back online 
they want us to go back to them...no, sorry, I'm with cointrader now.
Charting is a major one for me...I loved BTC china when they first came out with the best real-time charting.
Security is still a major concern.  I never really leave my BTC at any exchange for very long.  It's going to be a while until
we have unhackable wallets.
@_date: 2015-04-13 13:31:19
Perhaps there's some truth here...some interesting points.  I agree the sending of money is a very small part of the backend cost in sending remittances. The costs are in the recording, tracking, clearing of transactions.  Bitcoin gets rid of all that by doing it all automagically on the blockchain.  Furthermore, with more speed and accuracy I would think there would be fewer front end customer issues to deal with but time will tell.  In the end for customers to move from traditional carriers to Bitcoin there's going to have to be a big motivation...that means money savings that are worth the effort to overcome, as one person put it, the inertia involved  in making the change and learning the new system or routine, when the person would rather be doing something else like "sleeping" or "doing something fun for a change.
Case in point, when I heard you could get Starbucks for 20% using the "foldapp" site, I got off the couch yesterday and made a special trip just to try it out...it works like magic.  How many people buy Starbucks every day in the world who would like to save some serious cash?

Theoretically it's possible.  The blockchain clears transactions pretty much in real time, whereas banks, and stock exchanges have to run nightly batch jobs that take hours to clear theirs.  But with todays' computers and networks I don't think it's possible for these types of businesses to go full blockchain, but maybe in 5 10 or 15 years?  We're already starting to talk about 10 Gbit networks...in a few years 100Gbit and then 1Tbit.  Computer and network speeds will eventually catch up to the blockchain just like the internet speeds caught up (and very quickly I might add) to our use of multimedia a few years back.

Great chart...I've been trading for 30 years and most people have no understanding of technical analysis as you can tell from the posts.  They are the dummies, lemmings  and followers who always buy at the top.  
One thing we do need to see is the breakout and with some follow through before jumping in, but the base looks pretty amazing.  When it breaks out it should be a great new rally.

We're at an important technical inflection point to be sure but we need to see follow through past the 240 to 245 area.  If we do we might have a fairly good rally
I continue to believe that we have seen the bottom for this cycle, but I don't know for sure, nobody does.  But looking at this chart, I'm pretty impressed.  It looks like an awesome setup and I think we're already in the very beginning of the next up leg.  It looks to me what I would call a "stealth rally" but too early to get excited about just yet.
I would continue to buy on any meaningful dips and but re-assess every few days.

lol - well now I know you must be a troll.  I used to work at the Stock Exchange on the trading floor many years ago in Toronto when there still was a trading floor.  I never knew a trader who didn't use technical analysis or understand it's merit.
By the way, log charts show gains being smaller as well.  All it really does is smooth out the volatility and makes the longer term more understandable. 
Anyway, what can I say.  I've been around long enough to know that whatever I say will reach few ears and have even less effect when it enters the brain.  But I always hope to reach at least one or two that are ready to listen.  
Bottom line is don't worry and watch bitcoin price too much.  Go and do something else with your time and come back to it in 6 months.  The best traders I remember were the ones that didn't sit in front of their screens all day.  They would come in, take a quick look, make a trade or two and walk away and go have a smoke or do something else.

Looks like a pretty normal market correction.  Most markets spend their time in trading ranges.  You have to buy the dips and be patient. 
It's not like the Gold market where they can naked short, and re-hypothecate gold to sell into the market.  Bitcoin can't be naked shorted.

If I remember, when the internet started out was growth was largely driven by the porn industry.  It has to start somewhere, from the bottom up, in some cases.  
Bitcoin has a long way to go before the public gets involved in a big way. That's a good thing for people concerned about price.  Speaking as a long time "trader", you never see the top of a market until the general public starts getting involved.  And as an aside, looking at the Bitcoin chart, plotted logarithmically, which every trader should be doing, the price is building a very solid and large base.  "The bigger the base, the bigger they shoot into space", goes the saying.  But it takes time, lots of ups and downs, could be another year of sideways movement or more, or less, nobody knows.  Just keep buying a little on the big dips and be patient.  
In the meantime, go and have a starbucks for %20 off using some bitcoin...support the ecosystem, have a coffee and relax.

I think you'll have to study technical market analysis for that to more solid sense but basically it has to do with percentage movement rather than individual ticks or dollars or whatever your chart is measuring value in.  In other words, A move from 5 to 10 dollars is not the same as 10 to 15. Although both are 5 dollar moves, the first move is 100% and the second only 50% and the reverse is true on the way down.  Plotting a stock chart logarithmically over the long run gives you a clearer picture of the trend.  It works with any stock or market.  
Bitcoin looks like a scary chart if not plotted on a log scale.  I reminds me a lot of the Silver market.  Volatile to say the least but over many years , plotted log wise, it's easier to see what's happening and not get caught up in the daily ups and downs.  You can invest and trade with more confidence.  Not to say I know the future of Bitcoin, nobody does, but from a purely charting point of view, nothing looks out of the ordinary to me. 
That said I'm not into Bitcoin just to make money, I do believe in the industry, I'm one of those Uber enthusiasts, but seeing the potential in the industry there's also the possibility of making a good investment here in this new technology that may change the world in as big a way as the internet did.  But in my own mind we've still got 10 to 15 years of growth ahead and lots of ups and downs.  Cheers.

I can't understand why Ebay would separate from Paypal just because Paypal wants to use Bitcoin and have another stream of cash.  I think it's more likely Ebay wants to separate because Paypal, looking into the future, might have problems once bitcoin becomes more popular.  Ebay could easily , for instance, accept bitcoin directly and bypass paypal, cutting them out.  They could use the "Bitrate"  application and be themselves the trusted arbitrator, cutting paypal out of the picture.  Better to spinoff paypal now and slowly divest the shares while they can get a good price than later when they are "worth" less.
just a thought, I don't really know their motivations...

we'll see how liberland plays out.  I know that some people there want to make bitcoin their national currency.  sounds good to me, and a libertation constitution also, but with all the geo-politics at play it will be interesting to see how this little country evolves.  is it really libertarian or just a front with the goal of destabilization as the article suggests.

It's admirable that you're doing that, but the problem for us here in the west is we don't know you and there's no trust built up...trust takes time.  So many scams out there...what's the solution?

I don't think you understand the difference between Naked shorting and regular shorting.  
You are correct in that the exchanges can short bitcoin, IF, they have the bitcoin.  OK Coin allows shorting but you can't short if you don't have the bitcoin in stock.  Naked shorting on the other hand would require someone to create fake/paper Bitcoin, and that's not possible.

As long as your wallet is ok you haven't lost anything.  The keys in your wallet is what is important.  You can always sync a blockchain somewhere else or on another computer if need be.   Which wallet are you using by the way?  Sounds like you're not really connected to the network or port 8333 is blocked somewhere.

yup, negative rates will definitely lead to a run. It's been coming and now all they can do is prevent the cash from exiting the banks.  I mean why would anyone pay a bank to hold their cash??!!

sure anybody can make a coin...how many coins are out there now ...more than 500?  But who wants to use them?
@_date: 2015-04-26 18:23:34
it's not possible to naked short Bitcoin...you have to have the bitcoin in order to sell it.  You can short it, but not NAKED short it...

seriously I don't think i'll have to worry...and besides lotteries in Canada are not taxed.

There are a lot of people asking and trying to figure out how to get funds over there with Bitcoin.  It's the perfect way for anyone to be able to send a few pennies to thousands of dollars...But the problem is, who to send it to, who can be trusted???  (I know my grandson would like to send in 25 cents if he could)
We need to have someone with some credibility over there, perhaps a small micro-brigade of helpers and I think someone said a celebrity who people can put some trust in.  Early days, and opportunities abound for helping others.   
As far as the PR goes, I think we should forget about that and just focus on helping others. If there's utility in Bitcoin then it should be harnessed and will be, regardless of any PR.  The truth eventually wins, and let the chips fall where they will...

The new greek government has been bought and sold by the establishment.  They've sold their souls and are now in the process of throwing their people under the bus. They're gutting the country, stealing every last dime, and then they will default, not before.  This is the plan for Spain, Portugal and many other countries in the west.  Get ready, they're coming after your deposits too.  Every western country has put in the "bail-in" provisions into law (yes USA and Canada too).  Sell your fiat and buy some Gold, Silver and Bitcoin before it's too late.

The problem with gold is as always: trust.  ( "is there any gold there in those vaults and if so will it stay there").  I think it's a great idea but personally I prefer to keep my gold in my own hands and use bitcoin for transacting business.

Nobody is watching this, that's one great thing.  Bull runs happen when everybody is out for lunch.  We did a great breakout a few weeks ago and retested the long term upper trend channel with a viscious selloff. I'll put my neck out, this is the beginning of an incredible rally that will take us up to $3000 within a year.

It's actually an interesting way of keeping your paper wallet secret but on the bookshelf so to speak. Mind mind is buzzing now with the thought of this.  Reminds me a bit of Dan Browns books, full of all kinds of puzzles that need solving.  The answer is right in front of you if you know how to solve it!
