Maybe there should be a separate section for fiat to crypto gateways like coin base (yeah I know they differ for users country to country) and the pure crypto exchanges like bittrex, binanace etc. I think wrapping their heads around that is the difficult part for noobs.

The fact remains that and have become the two worst crypto subs, full of bickering and complaining about the other coin, while the rest of the crypto world is talking about development and progress of their own coins. 
These are really the two worst subs and this is a prime example of the shit behavior of both subs.

It is the memes that keep the price up. 18K had a good meme and we zoomed past. I didn't see any good meme support for 19K but hopefully the momentum of the 18K meme will keep us going to 20K.

Yes, this is always there as a last resort, but I prefer to avoid having too much cash on me in the US. Never know when you're gonna get robbed by a meth head.


When you say "an exchange", are you referring to something like coinbase.com? I already created an account with them. So when I buy my bitcoins on coibase, are they stored in a wallet that is maintained by coinbase.com? And is there a transaction fee that I end up paying when I buy on such an exchange? i.e. am I paying like 0.5% more than the value of a BTC at that given point in time? And secondly, is it safe to keep your BTC in a coinbase, or equivalent online wallet?


I'm sorry but I have no idea what this means. What are local bitcoins or BTMs? Could you explain? I'm still a noob. 
I've wanted to get my feet wet in BTC for quite a while now so I thought this was a good opportunity to learn about BTC and kill two birds with one stone.

Thanks for the exhaustive list of BTC related stuff.
Questions: 


Can you tell me how to go about doing this? Do I buy BTC on an exchange and how do I create a "wallet" or a "mobile wallet"? Is there an online service that provides these wallets which are accessible anywhere? Like an online BTC account?
@_date: 2017-08-28 08:17:47
What happens when a transaction does not get confirmed when the transaction fee is too low? Any way to cancel it and is it possible that it will get confirmed at some later point?
@_date: 2017-01-05 21:00:52
I understood most of that, though I don't know how to implement some of those things in practice. I'll try and figure that out.


What exactly does that mean? I really didn't understand that.

Damn even in June 2011, it was at $10 which makes it $250,000 worth of BTC. Today, that is worth $100 million. And back in 2011, he was talking about killing himself. Think of what he would have felt today.
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:41:34
It was 25,000 BTC, which was at about 10 bucks back in June 2011.

Then this is a circle jerk subreddit, right? I really don't know what the fuck is going on here the last few weeks.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:14:54
I keep hearing this, but how exactly do you cash out your money into fiat in a place that has no exchanges for BTC to the local currency? Maybe Philippines has BTC exchanges but what about say a less developed country?
@_date: 2017-08-24 09:02:52
Is this all sarcasm? I can't tell honestly.

upward or downward pressure?
@_date: 2018-02-12 14:51:10
Exactly. Though I always worry that someone (or some entity or group) who wants to destroy crypto might attempt a 51% attack on one of the big ones.

Yeah I'm extremely wary of the entire crypto space. Especially this last year. These ICO/alt coin scams (and the shilling and fud'ing about one another) has taken on a life of its own. So difficult to separate the signal from the noise.

It's a simple supply side demand manipulation tactic, where the seller uses the second derivative of the buying power of the commodity to offset demand in a controlled fashion. Like a wall basically.
