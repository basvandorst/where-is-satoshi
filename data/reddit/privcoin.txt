Find out what your Bitcoin address is on your MultiBit wallet. Plug those addresses into here

Solo mining Bitcoin is an all or nothing venture. You need enough hash power to be the first person to find at least one block before a mining pool does or you get nothing.
There are a lot of variables here, can you somehow get free or subsidized electricity? That would help a lot.

How much computing power is directed at XYZ Coin's blockchain. The higher it is, the more expensive it becomes to control XYZ Coin

The least possible information would be using Bitcoin Core and run it locally on your computer.

You can use my service to get different coins 
This is one of the **exact** reasons it was built. To prevent companies from enforcing their moral beliefs on you by banning you for using your coins as you see fit.

**Use a mixer**
If Kraken doesn't approve that you used Bovada they will ban you!
I'll plug my own mixing service at 
Take a look at this and don't let it happen to you.

No, you should be using real-time exchange rates. Crypto is subject to massive slippage and will cost you tons money if you guarantee one rate but the real exchange rate is something much different which it **will** over the course of a full day. This is a similar concern that I have had with my service swapping one coin for another instead of fiat. You must use real-time rates for your safety.

Are you talking about a deterministic seed as a private key or a single private key corresponding to a single public key?
I can't see any reason to require a private key to check a balance of a public address unless you're talking seed here.

You would get a portion if you join a mining pool. You need to determine if the cost of electricity + the mining hardware is less than the amount you would get by joining a pool with that hardware. Only you have the numbers to do that calculation.

Are you looking to do this yourself with no 3rd party merchant like Bitpay? The best way I can think of is registering your business to 2-3 different exchanges and creating your own back-end system to sell your incoming bitcoin for fiat via exchange API.

The risk comes from withdrawing a double spent or canceled Bitcoin Cash transaction from an online service.
1) In the case of PrivCoin mixing, an attacker with 51% hash power can send us Bitcoin cash for mixing and wait for us to send them new Bitcoin Cash coins.
2) They would then broadcast a longer chain that doesn't include the Bitcoin cash transaction they sent us therefore getting their coins back.
3) The attacker can then re-broadcast the transaction we originally sent and steal our coins. This would allow the attacker to take our entire BCH reserves in a single go if they wanted to which presents risk for us. That's why we have minimum numbers of confirmations which increases the attack cost and reduces our risk. If the hash rate drops too low, the cost to attack us may be lower than stealing our entire coin reserves would net them.
tl;dr Can an attacker pay less for 51% of Bitcoin Cash's hash rate than they can net from a double spend transaction being successful on any number of online services? If the answer is yes, shut down your service or require more confirmations.

The article is mostly accurate with respect to brand new coins/tokens that have no widespread adoption yet by virtue of being brand new.

A Mixer allows you to swap your coins for another person's coins for a small fee. We have a minimum fee of 0.8% which is worth it to maintain your privacy.
"In traditional financial systems, the equivalent would be moving funds through banks located in countries with strict bank-secrecy laws, such as the Cayman Islands, the Bahamas and Panama."

This is a very silly request. Like nearly everything else on the planet it is worth what people will pay for it. What people will pay is usually determined by the pros and cons of using it. You can find lists of pros and cons using simple Google searches.

VPN and encryption circumvent that. You can't block everything.

Stop trying to use the phone and the app. Take it to a professional you trust to copy the data off the phone and look for the private keys in a copy.

We will be forced to shut down our Bitcoin Cash mixing service if the hash rate drops too low due to risk.

PrivCoin (  ) will temporarily shut down its mixing service for Bitcoin on the date of the fork.
If both chains survive, we will support both going forward. If only one chain survives, we will support that chain and provide withdrawal only services for the other for investors who stored Bitcoin with us at the time of the fork.

Looks like you got it sorted. Buy yourself something nice with the "free" $100.

You probably got banned because you did something with your coins that Coinbase doesn't like. Prevent that by using a mixer such as the one I helped build

Open Bitcoin core and look at the receiving addresses. You can check Blockchain.info to see if any of them have balances. If so, go to the developer console in Bitcoin core and dump the private key using the command:
dumpprivkey ADDRESS
Take the private key and import it in another wallet.
