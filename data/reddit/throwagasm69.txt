Sure, like he didn't contradict himself all over the place, or write buggy code that core devs corrected over and over. And wow, you're the guys at BU, you'd think turning bitcoin into Modi's Indian Rupee would be a success. You are well and truly out to destroy bitcoin's marketcap to kowtow to some ridiculous state-sponsored paypal 2.0.

The mempool is empty and Jihad and Roger are literally blocking segwit and LN under a full mempool ruse. So where exactly has it gone?

Any crap nation can set up their cash. The first settlement layer, the backbone on which those shitty cashes are set up on is the worth, like bitcoin and gold. All LN transactions are bitcoin transactions.

@_date: 2017-03-16 13:31:41
Yes yes jstolfi, buttcoiners, altcoiners, all at rbtc, together with a bunch of miners in Beijing, all afraid of what segwit could bring. You seen the dribble that's passed for content at rbtc, where they celebrate ethereum and miner centralization like there's no tomorrow... anyways gl with that
@_date: 2017-03-15 01:54:55
I seem to recall, and I'm quite sure of this, that he doesn't give a crap about decentralization and pretty much hates everything about bitcoin. Like all buttcoiners he tried to get it defined as a commodity, made illegal etc.
Why is LN so hard to grasp for a real bitcoiner? You seriously don't think rbtc is overrun with buttcoiners and altcoiners worried their shitcoin will appear copied on an LN or sidechain?
@_date: 2017-03-25 14:08:32
The userbase doesn't have a miner fetish. Not that you would understand it as like all the others at btc you're an altcoin pumper and someone that doesn't understand decentralization. In layers, bitcoin is gold, not cash. Bitcoin isn't dogecoin.

Satoshi would've done POS if miners couldn't be usurped.
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:44:10
shitcoiners are nervous segwit plus sidechains makes them irrelevant, so they infest rbtc with their bile.
@_date: 2017-03-27 22:17:13
That's absurd. The opposite is true. There's a thread in bitcointalk about bitcoin spinoffs, the idea is called Qeditas. The idea is different coins would copy altcoins but spinned off a snapshot of the current bitcoin blockchain. They were gonna do something called aethereum. Now tell me with a straight face had they bothered to do it it wouldn't have destroyed the entire altcoin market.
@_date: 2017-03-08 01:10:52

Why was a ''buisness owner'' running for elected office at that age, then get prison for selling banned fireworks on ebay, and then escape prison for faking Cisco routers by testifying against a ''buisness'' partner. But to answer your question, everyone knows 'libertarian' is merely a dishonest version of being a right-winger.
@_date: 2017-04-30 13:34:21


So over at rbtc, when it was an ETH-shill-shithole current flavor of the month shitcoin paradise, you wanted to keep blockchain tech because you thought POS was superior to POW? This month you want more POW instead of less!!! Lol you phoneys.
@_date: 2017-04-14 02:16:29
Plausible my ass. 
@_date: 2017-04-29 14:00:41
But the ability to undermine a miner is the reason why bitcoin is POW instead of POS. The ability to change the mining algorithm is the key reason bitcoin is decentralized. I know miners believe they're the reason why bitcoin is decentralized, but that's like an autistic kid thinking he's the king of the castle.
@_date: 2017-04-26 22:13:41
Wtf do you think a miner with an asicboost is, a mystical monolith? Are you really that thick?
@_date: 2017-04-05 19:11:02


Duuude. Being a right winger without assuming the responsibilities of doing so has been around since the dawn of time.
@_date: 2017-05-13 12:01:48
Ripple is also huge but it's KYC-compliant. Reversing a chain in addition to doing an ICO doesn't paint a decentralized picture at all. And the dev team supports the main client, while ETC I assume just copies it for now. The idea of decentralization is that its impact is always felt long-term, not short-term.
@_date: 2017-05-23 01:44:41
There is no middle between bitcoin and the altshills from rbtc.
@_date: 2017-05-17 16:20:34


What garbage you speak


Goodness me, back when the mempool size was empty. There's the proof that given extra space now, miners would overinflate the size of blocks to push others out of business. Not to mention leave bitcoin unprepared for when the block reward fee falls to near zero by not having a supporting second layer under it.
@_date: 2017-05-29 14:20:25


Tried and tested on what premise? Please tell me you're kidding. Even when there were no apparent fees, costs were 7 dollars per transaction. If it's not Jihan coming out complaining segwit fees are too low, it's you not understanding all these years have had the security subsidized by inflation. But that ends when deflation sets in, at which point BUers will look to return to inflation I bet...
@_date: 2017-05-28 04:43:24


What nonsense. Your masters Jihan and Judas want unlimited blocksize to kill non-mining nodes and drag other mines into their own pools. Extensively documented all of this, from Gavin's 20mb to mining pool operators disregard for number of nodes.
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:18:39
No innocence lost, it's just the only one that's scaling, as Antonopoulos said.
And 2mb last year when blocks where size 250kb. Just kinda proves Core's point that as soon as blocks reach 1.5mb slimeball miners will gang up for 20mb. 
There's no negotiating with terrorists or retards.
@_date: 2017-05-29 13:43:11
Get the NSA to build you a blockchain then
@_date: 2017-05-27 01:14:17


So 3 years ago when blocks were empty and your miner cartel was pushing for 20mb blocks = how phoney are you?
@_date: 2017-05-11 21:01:57
The ones from the altcoin shitfest that have no volume?
@_date: 2017-05-12 03:08:16
The one that gave up on decentralization really early in the game in the DAO fiasco? Or ripple, another 25%, which already does KYC and inflates at a rate that would make the federal reserve hornier than a teen? Then there's litecoin, which went up ten-fold with segwit. NEM is now worth 1.5 billion and it has a new economy auroracoin stink feel smellier than a fart in a japanese cubicle hotel. Or Dash and Monero, which can be implemented in sidecoins and lightning network. Then there's plenty of shitty tiny coins with extended consensus where it doesn't matter as the blocks are small anyways and the usage is microscopic. But hey maybe you can preach your bullshit somewhere else, at a retarded buttcoiner center or a altcoin trader sub or a tragedy of the commons miner gathering.
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:07:00
How does that not pale in comparison with 1% off every shitcoin to bitcoin to shitcoin exchange???
@_date: 2017-05-24 03:41:04


Miners are code's bitches in bitcoin, you got that part upside down via force-feeding from the abject other sub which is full of bankstercoiners and shitcoiners and buttcoiners. POW is better than POS precisely because miners can be usurped, unlike in POS. You don't understand bitcoin.


You're speaking out of your hole. According to this site  its worth 15 times less than core.
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:22:04
Right, so that miners can dictate the terms every time blocks are full, whether or not it's spam no matter. Each time the block is raised it gets closer to paypal too. And no there was no HK agreement with Core. But don't let that stop rbtc from saying lightning network is centralized crap while at the same time saying people are switching to ripple.
@_date: 2017-05-12 23:59:31


You must be referring to Ripple's rise, while at the same time claiming LN is centralized. Hypocrite.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:42:20
Giving in to the miners is the insanity here, and to what, a plan of 5000gb blocks to serve planet earth... Just like saying money is flowing to the altcoin market, which consists of ethereum and ripple which are laughable on the debate on scalability. All of these dubious contrarian-posteuring are however badges of honor over at rbtc.
@_date: 2017-05-15 02:26:52
Lemme guess, users are flocking to ripple because they believe rbtc's claims that segwit is another ripple... cognitive dissonance aye
@_date: 2017-05-07 23:03:56
sidechains- bitcoinhivemind and mimblewimble
@_date: 2017-06-08 18:24:54
''The two parties have agreed to Segwit2x''???
What bullshit is this? You think all the bitcoin core devs are just going to pack up and work for Jihan? Centralized miners with patents such as asicboost, who've been blocking the capacity increase of segwit for two years, exchangers and payment processors (worried about how SW solves transaction malleability and enables decentralized L2 payment and exchange solutions aka you), and developers long-ago rejected from bitcoin are looking to fork off, get your concepts right.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:53:40
No one has it working because your miner buddies have been blocking a malleability fix for over 2 years now. You know, way back when the mempool was empty and such. And then your proof-of-vitalik fanbois have conveniently developed a pro-miner fetish, for bitcoin that is, not for their ICO-paradise, in their concern trolling. Second layers and sidechains are there to copy all the shitty altcoins and buttcoins you've been pumping these past few years, so it's understanding you should try social engineering.
@_date: 2017-06-20 02:43:34
Why would they use monero when they could use anonymizing sidechains or drivechains or second layers like mimblewimble? If they used monero it'd be like leaving gold to use copper.
@_date: 2017-06-19 00:58:54


@_date: 2017-06-10 01:02:03


The reason why bitcoin maximalists mostly if not all went in the direction of UASF is because they're not corrupted by rbtc rhetoric, where the players are highly highly highly invested in shitcoins. That's the concept of decentralization right there. Doesn't scale? Mimblewimble. Isn't private enough? Confidential transactions, shitcoins mimicked on sidechains. Non-mining nodes enable two-way pegs for a healthy decentralized second layer? Lightning network. Bitcoin minimalists also went UASF, as they're looking to keep the 21 million coin limit, while this is not a concern over at BU. So your concept of bitcoin is poisoned and you full well know it.
@_date: 2017-06-23 23:43:02


''So has this pool upgraded to SegWits?  I think this is a total BS solution to the congestion problem.  This is allowing third party companies like lightning network to come in and start creating off chain transactions which are taking away from our transaction fees/rewards.  So we do all the work in mining yet they get an path to make a ton of money on bitcoin transactions without creating any kind of mining infrastructure which costs all of us a lot of money.  For some of us this is our livelihood.  Unless I am misunderstanding SegWits and lightning network which I do not think I am, this is going to screw us the miners in the end.  Every time bitcoin halves the transaction fees become more and more of player.  SegWits will take this away from us and we will start to see most of our rewards right at or under 12.5 after the .9% fee is taken out.  I think if you wants faster transactions, then you just have to pay a higher transaction fee.  Sorry, but I don't work for UNICEF and in my case this is my livelihood so I am firmly against how they are handling this.  I would rather see a change in the code the allows for larger blocks and keep everything on chain.  
So what does everyone else think?  Am I misunderstanding this or do I have it right? ''
Tell us all why users and economic nodes (not the failing ones paid off by Bitmain like Bitpay) would care that you're losing miner fees to the lightning network. You chinacoin altminers are acting precisely like the institutions Bitcoin set off to obsolete in 2009. No surprise you have all that support from shitcoiners.
The part I don't get is why economic nodes followed proof-of-Vitalik in the ETH-ETC split. Maybe you can enlighten us all.
@_date: 2017-06-14 12:58:05
I know it can survive with more or less hashpower. My point is directed to the central talking points over at the other sub that was run-over by altcoiners, namely their claim bitcoin has worked fine up until now therefore all we need is bigger more retarded blocks, which it hasn't as it's had huge hidden costs, and that hashpower is the only thing that matters in bitcoin, which it doesn't because miners are merely servants.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:23:46
Duh. Let's see, bitcoin maximalists come up with sidechains and second layers. Shitcoiners counterattack with concern trolling about bigger blocks.

It's not an issue of liking ''the free market''. Haven't you thought the possibility that it's the exchangers and the miners that are fighting against the free market aka the devs and BIP148? What exactly do you think bitcoin is, a coffee machine?
There are a number of possibilities why Segwit would make Bitmain panic, covert asicboost, less chances for him to orphan other blocks from his chinacoin datacenter, less of a POW fetish, less centralized mining and disappearance of the notion of 1CPU=1vote in the form of nodes. Lack of vision from a communist of the value a gold-backed currency has, an interest in inflating the supply once it's done (btc maximalism and minimalism in a nutshell), together with bitcoin coder contrarian rejects like Gavin Andresen whose biggest claims to fame were meeting with the FBI, thinking Craig Wright was Satoshi and creating the Bitcoin Foundation.
@_date: 2017-06-12 17:25:13


There. Corrected it for you.
@_date: 2017-06-07 18:21:16
Whatever gave you the idea that exchangers and miners, the very ones threatened by the innovations in segwit or post-segwit, have a say in cryptocurrency? Wouldn't know where to start, atomic transactions, decentralized node exchanges, Proof-of-stake decentralization and privacy of second layers. Then there's the miners, who unlike the exchangers, would be better off with segwit but are centralized by Bitmain's plan to turn btc into paypal 2.0 datacenter to collect even more fees and rewards with bigger blocks, as they'd be at the helm of the first tier that would be the backbone of the second layers.
Oh. And spare me the ''free market'' preaching. You invest in a POW and someone does a POW change, you're like a bank before bitcoin, tough cookies.
@_date: 2017-06-17 19:36:43
It's 16mb in 2019, that's Jihan's road map. It was a demand for 16mb 2 years ago when the rbtc slimeballs started blocking segwit and the mempool was empty. You're compromising with a bunch of retards that hurt decentralized second layers.

There's no middle-ground. There's no compromise between years of discussion at github and lazy vested corpocrat interests. There's no compromise between a healthy second layer and the 20mb blocks a collection of morons and cretins has in store.
Bitcoin ''core'' are the maximalists looking to make the shitcoins irrelevant. On your sub you have anything from fans of Ripple to conveniently ex-buttcoiners.
Why wouldn't they invest in shitcoins and block bitcoin... easy moneyz
