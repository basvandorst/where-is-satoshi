Just curious..  By theft, I'm assuming you mean not delivering, not refunding cash and basically vanishing with everyones preorder money..  What do you mean by contract violation?

What pool/miner are you using to mine zetacoins?

I think part of the reason people are getting antsy is because they have been committing to ship dates and then those dates come and go.  Delays happen, patience is a virtue.  I personally don't believe we're being scammed, but, maybe I'm just the fool they're looking for.  I guess we really don't have any option at this point but to wait and see what happens in the coming weeks.
Did you preorder any asic's?  If so, who did you choose?

I received my 2 Jalapenos (+2 g/h upgrades in each for total of 14 g/h) a couple weeks ago.  I started mining at bitminter.com and just in the two weeks I've been mining there, their network hash rate alone has doubled.  With my current hash rate I earn under .2btc / day..
So it doesn't really matter who's chips are coming online, the fact of the matter is that the rate at which the difficulty is increasing means mining is not going to be worth it for the little guy in the very near future.

Well, that's not exactly how a pyramid scheme works.  Ponzi scheme, maybe, but definitely not pyramid.
I'm not saying I have proof that they do or do not mine with their gear before shipping it but I can say that I received my jalapeno's just in the nick of time to make the money back on them and then a btc or two.  I feel like it was just shitty timing the way that it all worked out with how crappy they were about getting their products to market in time for anyone to see any real profit from it.  I do feel lucky with the btc or two I made though.

Seems like they have been good about communication.  Developing something like this in such a rush with such a high demand only makes the usual setbacks feel that much worse.  Just glad I didn't invest in bASIC..
