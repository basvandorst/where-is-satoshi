All the mischief throughout history in monetary systems has resulted from someone else holding your money for you.

I use Ameritrade as my bank and they transfer to coinbase just fine.  They are used to their customers engaging in speculative gambling.  You can trade bitcoin futures with them too.

Accusing the other side of doing what you're doing is a very old propaganda technique.

Jews, however, are allowed to lend money at interest, that's why they were the bankers in the middle ages and later: [Deuteronomy 23:20](

Just click it and watch the first 10 seconds at 9:12 in (the link should move you to that point in the video).  Found it in the middle of a video I was randomly watching.  Has to do with Bitcoin and it's from a game released in 2014!

Go to 9:12.  It should be in the link.

There is no way a block size increase would solve the scaling issue for more than a little amount of time.  You can always buy Litecoin if you want a bigger block size for now.  If you don't care and want low transaction fees and think decentralization is a stupid anarchist fantasy go buy Ripple.

The Argentinian government should accept tax payments in bitcoin.  That would take it to the next level since everyone needs money to pay taxes.

And you need U.S dollars to pay your taxes so you better make sure you trade in ~30% of your bitcoins you earn for fiat every year or else.

Aquire currency to pay the government so you can make babies **or** you can have no income and have as many children as possible.  Like this guy:

I think you're thinking of Venezuela.  Colombia isn't doing so bad right now.

So let me just rain on the party for a moment here. What if they made running a full bitcoin node illegal, for example, and then proceeded to bust down everyone's door?  What would you guys do then?  Run the whole thing over Tor?  How can you verify transactions without someone running a full node?

Any Rand and Austrian economics have as much to do with each other as Stalin has to do with Nordic social democracy.

If they let people pay taxes in Bitcoin that would be HUGE.

I'm just waiting for the "Can you modify the bitcoin client so bitcoins are only transferrable via a KYC compliant intermediary?  You know, to protect the children."

There is plenty of evidence for everything except *you don't trust the source unless they are a major media corporation*.  In order to become a major media corporation they have to submit to the economic power structure and stick with the narrative.  So you're stuck in this chicken/egg credibility loop that you can't escape.

Methinks it's only a matter of time before the international financial powers that be, including the full might of most of the worlds governments take action against bitcoin.  I am having fun sitting in the stands watching and enjoying the whole thing unfold.

A country such as Bolivia which is dollarized could do it.  They aren't even printing their own currency anyway.

How about using some bizarre system architecture?  For example a Lemote with the Godson Chip?  It doesn't use x86 or Arm so standard buffer overflow exploits will probably not work on it.

You forget: naked shorting bitcoin is not possible.

Any truly new idea will take at least 20 years for the general public to get.

I was thinking the same thing.  Maybe the purity of the bitcoin market is what makes it move in such a mathematically regular way.

The Eastern Roman empire was able to pull itself out of the death spiral that Rome went into and survive for another 1000 years.  They mainly did this by radically decentralizing the military into the "[Theme]( system.

You did $100,000 in bitcoin sales but you have no way to pay for the taxes in dollars because they shut down any way bitcoins could be converted to USD.  Check and mate.  Geez you guys really thought they'd let you get away with all this?

The thing about islands is that you need a fresh water source or it's basically uninhabitable.  That, and what are you going  to do about electricity?  It's basically an off-the-grid living situation.
