Mining has become exponentially-harder computationally as the currency mints more coins. You will lose more money on power, computer parts, repairs, and time than you can possibly hope to make. Most mining is now done by large companies who own entire data centres in the Arctic. They have teams—*teams*—of people working around-the-clock.

Your wallet doesn’t store the coins. The coins are not a file or an object. Who owns which coins is secured by the distributed blockchain. The wallet simply lets you access them, because only you are able to decrypt them.

It’s gambling and you managed to make money.
I’d be pretty happy with myself.

It’s not that simple though. It was a reaction to rising transaction prices and the failure to deliver Lightning, which is simply only vapourware at this stage.

Why is it a scam? I don’t know much about the cryptocurrency community—I’m more versed in the compsci side of bitcoins—but those on the Bitcoin Cash sub are saying the *exact same thing* about Bitcoin proper as you say about them.

Couldn’t you simply put the HDD in another machine?

Disagree. Bitcoin is a commodity nowadays and is no longer useful for normal-sized transactions. Ethereum and Monero are the rising stars in this. Bitcoin to store money, and the aforementioned to actually buy/sell.
