A few days, and no, they never reached out to me.  I had to keep calling them.
@_date: 2018-01-08 23:15:55
This is exactly what happened today.  Same phone number too, though between two calls I was on hold for over two hours.

I'm not aware of any sort of error correction for addresses.  Source/link/explanation?
@_date: 2017-12-22 21:47:48
Yeah this looks to be sped up.  The GIF makes it look like it's going fast enough to take somebody's head off
@_date: 2017-12-17 14:41:35
Well, I feel sheepish...
I always just assumed that if you mistype, it goes to an address that doesn't exist, and thus your coin goes into limbo/the abyss.
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:00:45
Honestly, if it wasn't so fucking expensive to move BTC around right now, I might have sold some off last night.  Glad I didn't.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:45:45
Why would I donate my money to help some guy get his money?  It's not like it's going to some charitable cause...
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:28:05
Nope.  I feel like it might be fake/ a karma grab, tbh.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:59:11
I suspect people sell off their BCH and we see BTC climb.
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:49:44
2009 baby.  My buddy was mining it, said that you can use it for payment, but only for niche internet stuff.  He had hundreds, but sold them all off when they were still worth pennies.  I remember him bitching about it after we broke $100.  He passed away about a year ago, but I'm sure he wouldn't be happy having sold given today's price.  I didn't buy any until around 2012 or 2013, and I only bought a little bit to play poker online.  Didn't start seriously investing till this year.

This is the better analogy.  Jon won't be happy with any level of taxation on Sam's apples until Sam is left with a net that's "middle class."  Which makes Sam want to stop producing apples altogether, because he, just like half of the world, got in the game to get rich in the first place.

Bear trend after the recovery to ~15k.  We're sub 13k now, time to pull the trigger?  Any thoughts on where the support is rn?

@_date: 2018-08-20 20:26:02
It was Bank of America.  I'm not the only one this has happened to either.  What happens is that somebody will have their bank account compromised, they'll buy BTC from you for a bank transfer, then the actual account holder realizes what happened and the bank will hold *you* accountable while somebody in China makes off with your BTC.  They won't be interested in any documentation showing that the transaction was made in good faith, and that your crypto is gone.  There are things you can do to mitigate the risk, but sending somebody crypto in exchange for a bank transfer is inherently risky.  Cash in hand in a police station parking lot is the only reasonably safe way to use LBC IMHO.
@_date: 2018-08-20 17:57:09
LBC is dangerous.  I've lost more than a thousand dollars and had my bank account, which I'd held since I was 18, closed on me.
Never again.
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:41:42


One would think, and I made this point to the multiple reps that I spoke to.  I completely understand that the legitimate bank account holder is out the money, but I felt that it was completely unfair to hold me responsible.  I made a transaction in good faith, and it's not my fault that the other party's account had been compromised.
Anyway, I ended up being overdrafted around 1k (after I'd already lost 1k), and I simply told the reps that I would not be funding my account until the payment reversal were fixed.  That never happened, and they closed my account (but did not come after me for the remainder).  Thankfully I had the majority of my savings at the time in places other than my checking and savings accounts; if I hadn't, I would never have seen that money again.


Oh, believe me, I did.  The payment reversals came several weeks after conclusion of the transaction.  The buyer had relatively good feedback on LBC, though their account was newish (this was another mistake on my end--be VERY wary of new accounts on LBC), but right around the time the reversals came, a bunch of bad feedback hit their account, and LBC suspended them, but they'd already withdrawn the BTC from their account so there was nothing they were able to do for me.

Really?  Because putting stickers on public property is vandalism, and obnoxious teenagers vandalize shit.  It's one thing if you're putting a sticker above a urinal in a dive bar, but that was a perfectly normal looking bus shelter and now it's got a dumb sticker on it.  It's just tacky, is all.
@_date: 2018-05-10 06:49:57
I get that this is a "feature not a bug," but what if an average person in the future took reasonable measures to keep their keys secure and were still somehow hacked?  If law enforcement isn't going to handle this sort of thing, is there no recourse at all?
I get that being able to do a charge back for any old reason isn't a good thing.  But any average person would feel that having no recourse if something is stolen from you isn't a very nice "feature."
@_date: 2018-08-21 02:14:48
I'm not blaming LBC as a website.  I'm just saying that it's a community in which it's easy to get scammed.  LBC is just an open marketplace.  The marketplace itself isn't what's dangerous, it's the people buying and selling.  If anything, I'm partially blaming myself, and partially blaming my bank at the time.

I originally got into bitcoin a few years back to play poker online.  At the time, at least, online gambling wasn't legal in NY so that was my workaround.  1BTC was around $300 at the time, I eventually lost it all and never bought back in. 
@_date: 2018-06-13 18:22:24
Right now it's enough of a price movement that I want to be notified.  I'll just set it for % change I guess

Either, as long as I'm not risking funds being confiscated.  Not looking for sites that are real-money sites that will throw up flags for withdrawing to a NY bank account.  Hence, bitcoin...

It is.  You will also have to confirm from two separate email accounts if I recall.  If you need quick access to your BTC, don't put them in your vault.  You trade off convenience for security.

Eh, it's still good to keep a savings account.  Every paycheck I put 100 dollars into btc by default, and then make decisions regarding where the rest of it goes.  Vanguard, savings account, the bar...
But it's important to have quick access to emergency money.  My sister's dog got really sick, and it cost over a grand to keep him overnight in the animal hospital.  She didn't have it, I did.  Maybe her dog survives if I hadn't floated her that money, maybe he dies.  Vet hospitals often require a certain amount upfront - If I'd had my entire savings in btc, the dog would have been on the shitty end of the gamble.

Step 1:  Jump through the hoops to register at coinbase.
Step 2:  Buy bitcoin on coinbase
Step 3:  Download breadwallet, or get a hardware wallet, and send your coin to it
Step 4:  Hodl it
Step 5:  Profit as btc price goes to the moon, or lose all your savings as it crashes into the ground
@_date: 2017-10-08 21:42:37
That's not what OP is asking.  Further down the line, when bitcoin is more widely adopted, it'll be awkward for a clerk to tell you that your total is .00004576 BTC.
