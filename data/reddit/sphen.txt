To be fair to the some of the media involved in this, The Economist had doubts about Wright being Satoshi, for a number of reasons, including that he wouldn't sign a message of their choice.
"But doubts remain: why does he not let us send him a message to sign, for example?" -

First, I should add that I happen to agree with you on this.  
However, looking at this purely in the context of mathematical proofs, if I say I am X and I provide an incorrect proof of this, the incorrect proof does not imply that I am not X.  I could provide a correct proof that I am X later. 
Wright may well present a correct proof in the future, I doubt it, but it could happen.

A failed proof of Craig Wright holding Satoshi's private key is not a proof that Craig White is not in possession of Satoshi's private key. 


To deflect attention from the actual Satoshi? Or maybe for a payoff from the media who took part in this "reveal".  I think there could be many reasons that seem irrational to you and me.
