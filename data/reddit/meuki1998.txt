long to term what does that mean? or a typo?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:29:01
what ya mean exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:26:59
if i were to convert 50 bucks a month would that be a reasonable idea or rather pointless.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:22:38
Okay,cool i 'm thinking about 75 dollars approx to convert it to bitcoin.
DO you think i should go long term or try to flip it soon?
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:04:31
Can you explain this high reward high risk? I mean i understand the meaning but in correlation with an alt-coin? eg vertcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:19:24
Too late now :P, i'm thinking of doing a dollar cost average technique,since it don't have enough funds or time to be active 24/7.

Yeah ireland is fine, and credit card as well as debuit but debit takes 3-5 days on coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:26:01
True but that means a rise of 1000% which is not likely to happen soon right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:52:17
I was aware it's litecoin not litcoin, so not sure where you get that from. Also, a crash might actually be good for the people knowing,seen as they can buy btc at much lower rates and hodld it until it rises again in the future.
Must add that it's not certain it will rise if it crashes but most likely.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:38:02
True it even wentr up 1000 procent in a week or so so everythings possible i guess
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:43:01
yeah i'm thinking of depositing about 65 bucks a month, see where that takes me. i don't have the time to trade all day everyday nor the funds. But if it keeps going up i can't lose much more than i can miss right.
well keeps rising eventually i mean.
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:53:25
I'm still studying actually, this is why i cant convert big amounts or spend too much time on it certainly in exams period, as a trader you have to be ready at all times or so i read.
thanks for the support i hope you get mad rich!
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:17:37
Yeah it's at 7.8k euro right now. Is it worth it to put about 65 dollars into it right now?
i can lose that so m-actually thinking bout it,cant make much bad happen tbh.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:41:02
altohugh going from 600 to 6k is quite dfifferent then from 6 to 60 i believe
@_date: 2017-11-30 16:57:36
How do you suggest i approaxh this ?
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:54:07
Spending it can be a regret you'll never can make up again. If the prices go up you spent way too much. Like the pizza guy everybody talks about. I feel like btc has changed from a currency to buy things with,like other alt-coinsare today,to more of a stock kind of thing, which crashes and big players tend to win massively on,like the stockmarket.
But that's my  view atm.
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:37:39
GDAx is quit clear, or coinbase!
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:03:51
tbh vertcoin looks quite good tbh.
