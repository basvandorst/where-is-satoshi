Starting to look like in here.

Use Tradingview if you're trying to chart.

I think he means like what if ISPs start imposing restrictions on the Bitcoin protocol
@_date: 2018-05-02 12:33:58
Wth are you on about.

I'm not really pushing anyone. I literally lived on it for a year and a half. Unless you live somewhere where literally everyone takes BTC you're going to be exchanging that BTC for fiat at some point down the road. Either the merchant is converting it to fiat after taking the BTC, or you're converting it to fiat when swiping your card. Shift is a bridge so you can spend your bitcoin like you do anything else.
I tried living on BTC purely with no fiat bridges, it's not practical, at least not yet. 
From a tax perspective, everytime you use the card it counts as a trade. This can be a good or bad thing depending on your scenario.
But yes, please lecture me on something you _clearly_ have more experience in.
OH I should also mention, it works internationally too. I traveled to Europe and that's all I used while I was there.
@_date: 2019-11-26 22:55:52
Yeah and how do most people go from fiat to BTC and vice-versa? They trade. Shift literally did a market sell from your wallet through coinbase for whatever was needed to cover your purchase at that time. It was excellent because my balance STAYED in BTC and only converted to fiat on-the-fly.
Anyways, it's clear you have no real experience with spending BTC. Please try spending BTC, traveling, and living on it for a year. SPOILER: it's almost impossible without these cards.
@_date: 2019-11-27 00:34:53
Hmm, except I have the trades to prove it.
T0taly BrA1n D3ad!

Have you looked at Shift? I've had a Shift card since late 2017, it works great.
@_date: 2019-11-26 21:26:09
It appears Shift is out of service now, RIP. Shame they were great
@_date: 2019-11-26 23:01:23
No, back in April. I didn't realize it until now, I still have my very used card.

At 25+ characters you're never going to crack it.
If you can narrow down the character set or remember any parts of the password sequence that would help a lot, but 25+ and barely any other information... yeah good luck.

The number of technical inaccuracies he stated about how bit-coin works, the protocol, etc really bugged me especially considering he's the Vice Chairman of the Bitcoin Foundation.
Other than that, great interview :)

I'm having similar issues on version 70003, though it seems to be stuck on 181209 blocks.
I've downloaded the entire blockchain from [here](
OP, I'm also using this for Python scripts. Are you using [Bitcoin-Python]( It looks really simple, though I'd like to be able to "listen" for events like incoming transactions.
Hey, maybe we can learn some stuff together :). PM me. I'm always on the   IRC as bladezor.
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:11:52
Trezor FTW
@_date: 2012-10-25 03:03:11
Armory is cool and all, but the whole wait 10 minutes on a splash screen before being able to use it really defeats the purpose.
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:27:54
Lol citing a site that Roger Ver owns. That's like citing the bible as proof that your religion is right.
@_date: 2013-03-19 01:05:45
*sigh* I had a single bit-coin worth $12 only a few months ago. Fucking BFL screwed me hard.
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:50:50
How would a decentralized exchange work? Sure that sounds great but... in practice how the hell would that work? How would I fund my account? How would I withdraw USD from my account?
It couldn't work like Bitcoin. Bitcoin takes too long to verify transactions and that's just not going to be acceptable for a real-time exchange. Furthermore, a lot of personally identifiable information is needed by those exchanges to even fulfill those deposits and withdrawals.
If you've got an idea I'm all ears but I don't see how that would work logistically.
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:48:02
NxT is not a second level protocol. In fact none of the source is based off of Bitcoin. I think NxT is the most innovative, first 100% PoS.
As someone has addressed earlier Master coin is scary insecure and it hurts Bitcoin. Destroying BTC is not okay, MasterCoin is not sustainable in the long term for this very reason. The fact that it's &gt; $100 is mind boggling to me.
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:00:58
No, he's just smart.
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:32:50
I'm not defending this practice, however, people that aren't competent enough to look at the volume or weighted average before making a decision shouldn't be trading. It's that simple, free market is working as it should in THIS case. All the information was there, it's their fault for not seeing the blindingly obvious pattern.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:57:08
I miss diggnation :(
@_date: 2013-11-30 05:14:24
This guy is just throwing coins away?
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:04:52
NXT is not premined. It is proof of stake, the principle is entirely different. Please educate yourself before calling it a scam.
@_date: 2013-03-19 16:43:11
Because if I hadn't spent money on my ASIC which is yet to be seen, I would've bought more Bitcoins and would be at least $1k richer.
@_date: 2013-12-27 17:53:51
I was talking about NxT. If NxT is not redistributed then the coin fails. Redistribution means it's not centralized. The coin is very young but it's being spread every day
@_date: 2013-12-27 20:23:07
I think the issue with PoS is there's not a really good method to deal with initial distribution, especially when the number of  coins are static.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:21:04
FFS NxT is not premined, it's 100% PROOF OF STAKE. Not PROOF OF WORK.
Do you understand the difference? 
The stakeholders, including the developer paid for their NXT in Bitcoin. 1 BTC is the maximum one could invest. Furthermore, it's in the stakeholders best interest to sell and distribute their NXT otherwise it's worthless. Most have been doing just that.
It's not a scam, it's an entirely different paradigm. Please read up on proof of stake, coins aren't mined, they're "minted". Your minting ratio is based entirely on how many coins you hold. The number of coins in circulation is static, therefore any coins that are minted are 100% from transaction fees.
They are only worth about 10 cents right now too.
@_date: 2013-12-27 15:16:29
Coin doesn't work if they're not redistributed, so it's a moot point
@_date: 2013-04-11 07:20:29
I've seen bots like these since October. I'm not entirely sure they're to blame. The panic was caused by the big volume sells. We don't know for sure if these bots are causing a significant slowdown, sure 200-300 trades a minute sounds like a lot but I'm sure MtGox's servers can handle those and other trades just fine. 
I think the lag is really caused by the DDoS attacks.
@_date: 2013-11-30 06:08:34
Don't keep any sizeable amount of coin in an online wallet for some extended period of time, period.
@_date: 2013-03-19 17:45:13
Yeah it sucks, BFL is pretty much too late now, at least for my scale. The difficulty has creeped higher and higher, and will continue to do so ASICs or not.
@_date: 2013-12-26 23:59:41
It is decentralized, where the hell did you hear it's not?
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:53:45
Herp and derp?
@_date: 2013-11-18 02:55:27
Looks like it's popping boys.
@_date: 2013-04-14 15:43:17
They getting DDoS'd now too?
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:42:00
Isn't that a good thing? No one can buy the entire market
@_date: 2013-11-18 03:19:52
Not quite, but it's not straight vertical like it was a few minutes ago.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:53:19
Hey look everyone, look at this guy flaunting his BTC. :P
@_date: 2013-04-11 08:09:56
That's brilliant, however, this "manipulation", while maybe annoying only becomes effective because people aren't smart enough to look at the orders to realize that making judgements on 0.001 volume buy/sells is a terrible idea. 
There is such a thing as a weighted average people!
