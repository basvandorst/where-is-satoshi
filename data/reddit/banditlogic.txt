Sorry to keep raining on your parade. But there's an international space treaty.
You could find a tiny poor country, invest in its main businesses and control it's exports. You'd have so much influence you might as well own the place. If that's what you're going for

Also why would they launch if they didnt have all their BCH. Thats just putting the noose about your neck and kicking the chair.
IF and i stress IF, they decided to use the BCH to make a quick buck on the back of the price fluctation on other exchanges (and this is incredibly unlikely) then they would have bought it all back before they announced this launch.
They are probably holding it until the markets on GDAX settle. I know you dont like BCH but GDAX/Coinbase dont want it to crash and die so they are managing the release in such a way as this doesn't happen
In my opinion their actions are good for BCH and the crypto market as a whole. If BCH truely deserves to die (and for now I reserve judgement) then it will do so as a matter of it's own accord.
As ThomasVeil said, this is a serious accusation and I'd think carefully before you make these kinds of statements.

You couldn't do that. To create a sovereign nation you must be recognized by other countries. There is actually a piece of unclaimed land that people have tried to declare a sovereign nation and failed. Read more: 
Even if you were able create a sovereign nation. Getting foreign aid would likely be impossible. Unless you agreed to be some principality of a country with interests in those lands

Coinbase only accept euros right now. Fine if you already have euro.
I had a very good experience with coinfloor and made several deposits to them and they allow deposit via SEPA in GBP. They have a min 1000 transfer which is steep and fees are higher than id like, but in general the price on the exchange tracks lower than average and theres no buy/sell fees.
Good luck fellow UK investor

I considered it but I don't think he understands investments can go down. I don't feel like dealing with the fallout of a family row if everything popped. I'd rather just give some of gains into a trust for his son (my nephew). Gains all round that way.

You're right, of course, but let's not forget that yoy growth on crypto is exceptional from an investment point of view. Let's be happy with what we have made and not bitter that we didn't get more.

Not the furthest we have diverged. Maybe the furthest on the downside but we were way over in December. Bitcoin isn't gunna follow a nice a curve up. It's gunna up and down like a yoyo. No traditional stock, commodity or currency follows a curve like that. Just relax, let it do its thing, it could go even further away but I believe it will come back up just like I believed it could come down.

Thank you for posting my thoughts exactly.
The 'city watchdog' is actually giving sound advice that some people probably need, and that is "dont mess with CFD's if you dont know what you're doing" I am concerned as I've seen very well constructed ads for plus500 on my facebook and youtube (likely targeted from my search history) which could convince a novice to believe they are buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:09:07
Did that guy really say "you cant short bitcoin"?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:16:20
On another serious note, if you have come into a lot of wealth from bitcoin it is seriously worth creating a will (if you havent already) or amending it to make sure your investments go to the people you want them to go in the case of your untimely death
Long live you all.

One of my friends surprised me the other day. He caught me checking crypto prices in our lecture and started asking me questions about the recent dips and stuff.
He said he was always meaning to get into it but never did. I guess he will be sorry. I encouraged him to dip his toe in the water. I mean 50 bucks is 50 bucks right?

Cash is used in criminal activity. Any person who uses that argument to justify not using bitcoin should not use any cash.
Hell there's a drug dealer who had his own card machine. Crime happens, all kinds of payment methods and currencies are used for different reasons.
@_date: 2017-11-19 16:57:52
As has been said before, you have shitty co-workers. Asking for handouts just because someone made a good decision and made some cash is shameful.
I regularly talk to my friends about how much I'm making in bitcoin investments (we are all maths undergrads, some financial maths) but I generally use %-age returns or ROI with them.
With my close friends (who I had planned to go in a joint investment together with until they pulled out) I talk about plain amounts. I'm open an honest with them as they are obviously curious as to how it's working out for me going alone.
You did the right thing by telling them where to stick it. Invite them to make some money of their own by educating themselves on cryptocurrency and investing at their own risk. You could always suggest you'll be there to help explain and make sense of some of the procedures.

He's in Hackney, living on a boat is a creative way to actually have your own living space as property in London is ridiculous to rent.
I know someone who lives on a boat in the north of england (where property is far far cheaper) just because she likes the boat.
He may have made poor decisions, or he may just be a general guy who cant afford the stupid rents in London so he's forced to live on a boat to avoid a 6 bed house share in a 5 bed house.

I deposit to a polish accout in GBP to avoid loss in currency conversion. From their website (at the deposit details page):

Pretty much. Theres probably a more technical explanation but fiat is basically government issued notes and coins. Previously backed by gold but not anymore, so if the country goes broke its worthless (see more on zimbabwe 2008 crisis for what happens when a government is irresponsible with its fiscal policy)

@_date: 2017-11-24 18:52:18
Im not familiar with wall of coins. However if you didnt agree to any terms or enter some kind of contract then its shady.
I imagine that the contract probably lists the price as advisory until funds are recieved into their account at which point they will calculate the market price and issue based on that. It protects them against people not paying if the price moves against them.
Ill check the terms on their site at some point tonight (my housemate is holding a house party so im gunna be up anyway) but i suggest you do the same.
In future, perhaps use an exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-13 00:18:15
This. If I could make the transfer I'd buy more. But the SEPA payment takes at least 1 business day if not 2

I left santander years ago as i had many issues with their service.
Ive since moved to HSBC and i have to say Im phenomenally impressed with their service. With the exception of constant loan offers (i guess my credit is good) they have gone out their way to help me. When i made my first bitcoin trade the web chat guy was kind enough to talk me through the transfer process to the exchange step-by-step. I didnt directly say i was buying bitcoin, just that i needed to send upwards of 4 figures to a bank account in europe. They asked no questions whatsoever. I paid £4 flat rate for the SEPA transfer plus a % at the exchange.
@_date: 2017-10-09 00:00:07
