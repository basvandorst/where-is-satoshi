Just report it as spam and move on.

You still have to be verified with them to trade for bitcoin and deposit into your account, if you flag KYC laws does this really change much? Other than lacking control over what you do with those funds, can't they still report everything?
Does anyone know if you can use the vault system without adding bank/personal information?

Statistically speaking is bound to happen once in awhile.

Doesn't seem that difficult as long as you can carry cash or something like travelers checks into the country without the penalty.

++ On focusing on remittances, it lets you discuss an area where bitcoin shines for the people who really need and deserve the benefit - there is definitely enough here to make a 10+ pg paper if you dug deep. Avoid topical stuff if you can, digging into one topic using a variety of different sources and arguments to support it would show off the research you've done. Let's face it, a school teacher is going to look much more favorablly abt a paper arguing to empower the unbaked and poor than one stoking finance revolution flames.

I really don't think that's the case, imagine the ridiculous backlash they'd get if they started seizing accounts of anyone donating to politically controversial people. I think both have double digit support in the us, it'd be a nightmare for them.

It's a thesis, it makes assertions and is backed up by the rest of the paper.
@_date: 2015-04-12 01:39:24
I think you've got a good thesis, two things I would comment on:
This is a pretty ambitious thesis that would require a lot of discussion to support in a meaningful way. Consider limiting the scope.
Try a bit of copy editing, if you're more economical with your words it'll be easier to keep readers attention - here's your same thesis in fewer words: Bitcoin solves economic flaws in the financial system while giving control to the public and creating new opportunities.

Yeah, simplifying the numbers this definitely is off. Say in 50 years $ goes down an order of 10, 1M --&gt; 100k. Going the other way, a "constant" price good would go up an order of 10 relative to dollars of that day. So the 1k btc would go up to abt 10k. Would take another 2 zeros / 100 y to reach 1M.

Oh I see, thnx. So this shiws since blocks are being solved faster than 10 min on avg, inflation is a bit higher than commonly cited?

I'm not sure a mixer would have helped much in this case. If two addresses are know to belong to person A and person B, it'd be pretty simple to connect the flow of btc between them. A mixer just makes it plausible an address with your money is not yours. Once it is known who it belongs to this mix is undone. Here, the IRS agent had DPRs address and presumably also the Rouge agents - that's speculation on my part tho anyone who's read and know otherwise plz chime in

Worked for me, thx

Paired with an explanation of 'most work' makes this a really good answer for the layperson

You can sweep the vault, it's a 2 of 3 multisig I believe where coin base only has 1 key and your frequent use key signs in the browser. You also have a key meant to be used 1 time to sweep when combined with your other key.
