Really impressive website. Hopefully some companies will jump on board. I'm in Melbourne and there are only about 20 businesses here on Coinmap. A few more bars and restaurants will be nice. 
Good luck with the business :)

You guys need to setup a new post where we can all save and we can follow the bet!

Right, I'm aware of that I just had the phrasing wrong. I have several copies of my wallet so assume he'd have multiple backups.

A shame there has been no response yet :( It seems there are a lot of options for people in the USA. Most of those sites aren't really setup for international visitors. I bought 37 coins a few weeks ago and wish I'd gotten more. Might have to just keep checking localbitcoins for a decent rate.

The FBI claim to have his wallet file.  If they don't have the ability to decrypt it, how can they claim they have the wallet? This could be any wallet file.

May be a stupid question, but according to those instructions if you generate an address offline, how does that address get created in the Blockchain? And what happens if it generates an address that is already in use? I mean the probability may be miniscue but it could happen?

I know there are cameras at McDonalds, but why would McDonalds waste time and resources helping out the Police with something like this? Were you a paying customer that day?

Q. Do you need 15 percent of the network power to perform a double spend? If yes than one 
 confirmation should be fine for all transactions, seeing as the block will eventually be completed. 
So even for large amounts we don't need it to be fully confirmed right?

I've bought bitcoin from coinjar and it worked well. I don't see why you would need a mt. gox account, surely any wallet would do.

I think Linux would have it beat.

No you can't because it wasn't proof read before being sent out.

How does escrow work with bitcoin? Wouldn't it rely on the buyer being honest? 
@_date: 2013-04-08 10:32:17
Also don't feel you need to buy a lot. You can simply buy 0.5btc and play around with it.

If you follow basic pc security you are pretty safe. AV, firewall, malware free etc

Okay so you guys know I did end up getting the btc back today. So I guess you will eventually get it back. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 02:44:42
A Question: With Blockchain.info if you download the wallet once, that's fine isn't it? You can always dump it into a client like multibit and have access to your coins. They can only get stolen from the website if someone breaks your password. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 02:30:23
A shame we can't verify if this was a legit donation or him shuffling bitcoin around. 
@_date: 2013-11-16 19:08:38
But it's safe to say it would never happen according to this graph. I think the reason you have multiple wallets is so you sweep the funds into a spending wallet when you need them. 
@_date: 2013-10-13 17:33:01
This is why people are skeptical of the cloud. Some providers don't encrypt and go through your files and hand it to the government when asked. Others say they have encryption but it's done sever side. Only client side encryption can be trusted.

In Australia you can just walk into a bank and hand the teller cash with a single deposit slip to put it in coinjar ' s account. No personal information required.

Firstly sorry for the poor grammar, I'm on my phone. 
Do you think if btc becomes mainstream that it will be common to continually buy coins to spend? My problem is if you can pay for an item cheaper in dollars why would you buy it in btc? 
Of course for shady items people will be willing to pay a premium, but what about other purchases? 
@_date: 2013-10-08 04:19:37
There were a lot of questions in the beginning about this. Like did they simply find a paper wallet with all the coins on it.  Your answer seems the most probable.

So what happened with your ANZ account is it still locked out or operational again?

I renewed a domain a couple of weeks ago using btc. My only fault was it took 70 minutes for 6 confirmations and for the funds to appear at Namecheap. From there I could renew the domain. It would be better if they allowed it at 1 confirmation or something a little faster. 
@_date: 2013-02-20 02:19:15
Unrelated, but I sent .00000004 without a tip and it is still an unconfirmed transaction. That was a week ago. Will the funds eventually go through, or get rejected at some point? Not fused about the the BTC, it was a test transaction to someone as a donation. 
@_date: 2013-10-08 11:37:44
Does this actually happen?

I live in a pretty good city and in the section I was in over the weekend we have large metal parking meters which only accept coins, and don't refund money if you pay over. These things are atleast 30 years old. I don't carry coins with me at all so a friend had to pay. They can't even adapt to notes or things like PayPass.
@_date: 2013-03-24 04:20:02
Ah okay, it does make sense that all addresses are already generated. This morning I tried sending a transaction only slightly changing a letter in an address to see if it would work. Looks like there is a calculation to generating valid addresses. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 19:15:59
The seller also had a feedback score of 100, indicating no previous problems. 
@_date: 2013-02-19 07:53:01
Ah okay good point. My vision of BTC doesn't extend as far as others where btc becomes a mainstream global currency. But it makes sense if a company is collecting a lot of revenue in BTC for them to pay that out to labour as an expense.

That reminds me, I donated $65 worth of bitcoin to them a while ago. Still haven't received my free t-shirt, although I am outside the US, so not sure if I'll get it or not. I just wanted them to get the money and try out spending my coin more than anything. 
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:13:54
I've bought from them twice now and they have been very good. 
@_date: 2013-10-10 01:57:53
Chris Hayes' show is very good. 
@_date: 2013-11-09 05:42:55
You don't need to buy a whole coin, just like you don't need to buy a whole gold bar. You can buy $12 worth of bitcoin now, you'll get ~0.04btc. Why not get whatever you can afford to lose and buy in?

Could've been some hardware conflict somewhere. I still have a Windows partition for games and nowadays Windows will bluescreen for a driver/hardware fault.
