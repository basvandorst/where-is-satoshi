Just watching and not buying in?
@_date: 2019-07-08 16:15:24
People were betting that the Bitcoin would not go above X price beyond a certain date. (Or that it will be below a certain price)This is called shorting. 
The total value of the shorts was $44 Mil, but once the Bitcoin price went above the set price, the exchange liquidated the position, and asked for their money from the traders.

Agreed, my hope springs eternal for Crypto! Any positive sign will do for me.

Think he / she is suggesting that 30 million user accounts might not be regular users and many may have never made a purchase after sign up.

Call me out all you like, you can be involved with Bitcoin and Bonds, it’s not against the law, only your seemingly sensitive disposition. 
Wealth building is the only way to be free for you and your family in my opinion, not extravagant wealth, but enough to say fuck you and ride out some bad luck, bad economy, or bad times. 
Bitcoin for sure will be a big part of that, but it’s not replacing the world economy anytime soon, and Diversification is to be spread risk, you can’t diversify into one asset class.
But you do you, and keep fighting the good fight.

Whilst I do love Bitcoin and Crypto, and agree that the market is overpriced and inflated, liquidating everything into one asset class, especially a volatile one such as BTC is naive and wildly optimistic. 
Where there is risk, people should diversify. 
Real estate is a huge market that will always have demand, Precious Metals are great wealth preservers, 
Shares and Stocks can either be held with stop losses, or short the market if you’re sure it’s going to collapse. 
Pension funds, Investment funds and Governments/ Corporations who control vast amounts of capital are not able to invest in Bitcoin / Crypto due to their own rules or imposed regulations, and they control vast amounts of wealth, Trillions upon Trillion of dollars which is not going to be risked upon a new volatile asset class. 
Also the ultra rich corporations and individuals have the money to short the hell out of Bitcoin in the futures market if ever becomes too powerful. 
A very effective way of suppressing price growth, look at Gold.

You have already lost a lot of Bitcoin by day trading as you say, so this should be a lesson not to trade without experience and stop losses etc. 
To become a Hodler I would say focus on accumulation of actual BTC and not the Dollar value of your BTC. 
You will then see dips in price as opportunity to get more BTC per Dollar. 
Buy at regular set intervals, ideally automatically to take the emotion out of it. 
Set a target, is it 1 BTC, 10 BTC, or 100 BTC? 
Give it time, are you really willing to set aside 10% of your earnings every month for 10 years or more?
@_date: 2019-11-07 12:14:36
Nope, people are free to make their own choices, and mistakes. 
I only try and see both sides of the arguments. 
I was in and around Crypto in 2017 / 2018 and remember some of horror stories of people who had invested over their head into Bitcoin (and scams like Bitconnect),  with suicide warnings on the message board and divorce commonly mentioned. 
I defo err more on the side of gold, silver, cyrpto and cash, but i try to be realistic. 
As things stand these are only hedges against total failure, not a ready made replacement economic system in my opinion.
The system could be just as oppressive under a Bitcoin, especially in the wrong hands.

Bitcoin will never die, I agree, I buy as much as I can, when I can. 
There is a difference between Bitcoins death and it taking over the entire value of the economy, which is what would happen if everything collapses but Bitcoin prevails allegedly. 
Bitcoins success is not a zero sum game that is dictated on the wholes systems collapse.

Maybe they should just remember it? Would make them better economists and people if they had better memories.
@_date: 2019-08-01 21:58:48
What a glorious time that was, thought it would never stop.
@_date: 2019-10-25 16:43:45
Does this mean we have been saved from a weekly close below the 200 day ema, averting the bear market? 
If so, great news!
@_date: 2019-08-05 21:58:27
If an economist had no ability to recall information and had to rely on props to remember key points of their subject I think that would make them a poor professional. No offense taken as it’s a silly reply. 
My original point stands, good day sir. I SAID GOOD DAY SIR!
@_date: 2019-10-24 22:45:07
This post just encouraged me to buy a little bit more, thanks!
@_date: 2019-06-05 19:39:10
No you’re right, DCA all the way, but it’s not a bad tome to get started.
@_date: 2019-06-04 15:54:12
Still feel like a relative newbie to Crypto, been in since May 2017 and seen my fair share of ups and downs, but this also took me back, Trayvon James and Crypto Nick felt like a long time ago now, and Bitconnect still makes me embarrassed about being so stupid in the early days.
@_date: 2019-06-04 18:21:38
Correct newbies, anytime is good to buy, but after a big drop is always one of the better times.
@_date: 2019-08-29 10:02:28
Accumulate when you can crypto comrades!
@_date: 2019-12-04 15:47:34
All I know is that I’m willing to risk approx $7500 and hang around to find out,

Never heard of this guy, but decentralization means it can’t be stopped, free speech works all ways and for everyone, not for just for people we agree with or like. This is what Bitcoin offers, unstoppable P2P payments with zero censorship which in my opinion this is one Bitcoin / Crypto’s greatest strength. Even if it is a moron.

Been edging my way back in, made another small purchase today, and aim to keep investing small but regular amounts. Have a lofty aim of buying a building near me for cash (Crypto) for a community Judo / BJJ gym. Just putting my weird little goal out into the world! 
@_date: 2019-01-13 18:29:27
You are correct, not arguing it really but BTC-e was before my time on Crypto so to speak, have read about the Mt Gox collapse but never heard of BTC-e

If the funds never arrived, then it doesn’t sound like ledger then, there are very helpful individuals on Reddit who offer assistance in recovering various lost funds, so might be worth asking around. 
I personally have never lost funds when using ledger or Trevor. Crypto is not exactly user friendly though, and has a long way to go before to improve this, in my opinion. 
@_date: 2019-01-16 09:45:53
Yes whilst I love Bitcoin / Crypto, and fundamentally like the freedom it guarantees it does simultaneously concern me that it gives a funding vehicle to extreme points of view. I realize this a contradiction but it’s either financial freedom for everyone or nobody, there can be no exceptions. This is where the argument for regulation comes in, ie is it used by criminals, Paedophile groups, terrorists, corruption etc but we cannot have it both ways, once the door is open (which it is) anyone can and will use it. Of course these horrible things will happen with or without Crypto unfortunately. 
Third party payment vendors must be concerned about crypto, from a business stand point too, as you say ideally they want everyone to use their platform but once publicity turns they have little choice but to pull services, not a concern for most Crypto currencies.

Definitely an important factor when selling, but Bitcoin is easy to sell irrespective of tax considerations

Genuinely never heard this before, always felt / thought Binance were one of the best exchanges, and used them regularly, will certainly look for more info and get my tokens / coins onto hard wallets. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 23:04:31
I have used several different options, pretty easy i would say? 
@_date: 2019-01-04 09:01:46
Did you lose funds from your ledger?
@_date: 2019-05-17 12:05:25
Wow not seen a ‘bought the dip’ on here for a while!
@_date: 2019-05-19 22:39:43
Are you selling tiny little cameras or is your store tiny and little?

Investors should diversify and include both. If you want to be conservative then buy a higher percentage of Gold and if you want be aggressive then more Bitcoin.

Sold to pay for a family holiday at about $11k, but more at $8k, then bought back in at $4.2 and above.

I love Silver and Bitcoin / Crypto, I try to buy a little of both every month. Silver I love because it’s a real tangible wealth and will not lose value like fiat. 
Crypto I love the tech behind it, the volatility equals opportunities in the long term and when the value rockets I try to divest some into Silver. 
Fiat currency has been kicked to death by quantitative easing, inflation and government expenditure, so anything that might hedge against this worth investing in. 
I invest in the stock market via my pension, but otherwise keep away from it.
