Renting mining equipment is quite possibly the dumbest thing I’ve ever heard of.
Please don’t fall for this. The contract legitimately states that you are buying 0.001BTC for the price given. This by definition isn’t a mining contract, there is no variable as to the output of bitcoins. 
By the way OP, technically this is a federal offense as you don’t have an MTL. Are you registered with FinCen?

Great. If you operate several businesses you should understand that the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network isn’t going to ask about your eBay rating to determine if you are laundering money.
Frankly for me it’s not about the potential for money laundering. I just think it’s dishonest to advertise hash power when you aren’t really selling hash power. Selling hash power would signify that there is some likelihood of getting between say 0.0009-0.0011 BTC, determined by the total hashrate of the network (assuming they are actually renting your miners).
Are you sure you are selling hash power? It looks like you are really selling 0.001 BTC for USD via an online auction. Without proper KYC or specification of location of your customer. Which, whether or not you personally agree with the law, requires a money transmitters license to operate the United States.

I would call what you are doing fraudulent advertising. Let’s clearly distinguish between 
1. those who sell straight bitcoin to consumers (exchanges)
2. those who rent miners out and give a variable amount of btc based on hashrate and runtime of the miners (legitimate mining contract operations)
3. those who advertise renting their miners out, but don’t pay the actual amount the miner accumulates. Instead, a static and unchanging amount of BTC is transferred essentially for USD (your operation)
Can you prove (via blockchain explorer) that the pooled block rewards that your miner received for X amount of time went to the paying customer? Was this transferred via any type of autonomous system? Does the customer have any chance to receive more or less than 0.001BTC? If not, you are likely engaging in criminal behavior under the current law. 
Is it likely the SEC will come after your low-budget operation? No. Just as the DEA doesn’t give one fuck about some dime bag drug dealer. 


The US has laws that dictate who can sell marijuana legally. But hey, the cartel sells marijuana too. They aren’t registered with the ATF Bureau, or any state liquor control board. Does that mean because the Cartel doesn’t follow laws, that you as an individual citizen are entitled to sell marijuana? No.

Sorry if I met you with a rude tone. I just find these types of operations a ‘bad look’ for cryptocurrency in general, and all the more reasons for governments to bring overly punitive regulation to cryptocurrencies as a whole. Legitimate operations are then hindered because they have to comply with overbearing regulation designed to protect consumers from people like you.
Like clearly you are intelligent enough to understand that you can make more money with your miners by doing this. You are ripping people off, people who are likely uneducated on what bitcoin is or what mining contracts are. The distinguishing factor for me is that you aren’t selling legitimate mining contracts, you are selling bitcoin. A legitimate mining contract involves selling a time-dependent service for miners, whose reward for such service in Bitcoin is legitimately variable. What you are doing is essentially selling a non time-dependent mining contract, possibly or possibly not procured from your own miners. 
Your version of ‘mining contracts’ have no distinguishing factors from ‘selling bitcoin’ in general, besides that you claim it was procured from your trove of S9 miners. You then sell these (mined?) bitcoin at overpriced rate. I find that distasteful, as I mostly expect beginners to purchase your product. Beginners whom I believe for the greater long term health of the ecosystem, you should be fostering and educating. Who else would purchase your product? Criminals, duh. You aren’t providing a useful service in my opinion. 
What happens when criminals who use ID and CC theft to purchase your goods using stolen funds? Is there a return policy for your bitcoin, or does your system essentially enable criminals to their ID theft operation into bitcoin? You get your money. Criminal gets their washed bitcoin. But who really paid for that?
I am not a Registered Financial Advisor nor do I hold a law degree. But I highly doubt being a Registered Financial Advisor entitles you to sell bitcoin as you have been doing on eBay. 
I don’t even know why I spent so much effort typing this, you and I are the only ones going back and forth and both of us know the real truth about what this is. 
But I too would like a lawyer to answer this specific question regarding a ‘mining contract’ loophole. It essentially allows you to sell bitcoin, but only if you procure that bitcoin from mining. Would one have to prove that? The issue is that I could say hey, buy my mining contracts, secure the network. And then not really have any miners, at all, but instead send bitcoin from any old wallet. All bitcoin was mined at some point...

Though this measure is not Bitcoin specific, if you assume each blockchain user is a bitcoin user consistently, then you can get a decent estimate. You might look further into transaction data through analysis of the actual bitcoin blockchain to get a more accurate estimate. Or a more accurate way of defining to what degree blockchain users ‘use’ bitcoin. 
And even then, it is difficult to take into account the actual amount of bitcoin traded, especially when so much wash-trading and illegitimate volume is reported by the currently centralized exchanges. And OTC trading? Who knows what’s going on really, basically only Tycho and Kepler. plebs tryna find a moon
Can also assume cheating/duplicate address rate stays constant, and then estimate number of ‘users’ ^
@_date: 2019-02-27 09:03:06
To decipher between means of payments and speculative currency is futile. All currencies are speculative. Most of what we think of as ‘normal currencies’ are just geographically isolated and used commonly in reality, so users don’t know a difference really. Some bitcoin  users may be ‘mostly’ focused on bitcoin as a speculative asset, but also use it as a means of payments (aka every user in crypto ‘exchanges’). Some may only use it as a means of payment, but not for speculation (any business/exchange that uses stablecoins/the whole darknet). 
Your quest for finding an accurate number is infinitely screwed.  
You would have to classify participants, most accurately by a gradient measure of the rate of btc use. It would be very easy to categorize businesses and entities that take bitcoin as payment vs an average joe by blockchain data alone that could be matched. But for intra-system payments (which is where a lot of bitcoin speculation trading happens) there is a certain uncertainty to the data. You need centralized exchange data, which can only be inferred from reporting. Exchanges take bitcoin, spit out whatever currency but usually in lesser form. They can honestly report whatever tf they want. By that measure participants can be defined as people who “give bitcoin to people who take bitcoin as a payment”.  And then account for semi-anonymized transaction data from the actual chain? To define what a certain entity has, and what they will actually give out over time? Hard. Impossible unless given a probability of uncertainty.
At the current state most exchanges that dominate the BTC bought from Coinbase goes to predictably not-so-random centralized exchanges. You may infer what you want from the data and spread they report/supply. So you literally have this unpredictable variable whose truth may only be known by further analysis/comprehension. And again, these are completely centralized sources you are drawing data from, you have no idea what really happens at centralized exchanges.  Good luck lolololololooooool this is what people get paid the big bucks for, let’s see whatcha got big dawg.
To infer what the ‘means of payment’ is, you have to go a lot deeper than the bitcoin blockchain. The go deeper than the bitcoin blockchain, you’ll encounter a lot of what I will call  ‘entropy’

That was badass. Though I would argue for a case study of Marco Polo’s description of “The Great Khan”.  The one reason Polo knew the mongols were increasingly a powerful empire was due to one of the first widespread implementations of paper money.
Khan forced all merchants and ‘citizens’ to conduct business in his paper notes made from mulberry tree bark. Each note was stamped by politically powerful entities, with the threat of death for counterfeiters and anyone caught not accepting the notes.
Merchants traveling from India would bring heaps of gold, trade Khan the gold at a price higher than they could get anywhere else, and he would give them a note from his seemingly endless supply of mulberry trees. The Indian travelers could then live the high life on the journey back, and use these notes just as they would gold, anywhere in the mongol empire. 
Khan soon amassed nearly all physical gold, because of two main reasons: First, his notes were recognized widely as money. Second, it became obsolete to have to carry physical gold as a merchant. 
Through our little club, bitcoin will grow and acceptance will spread. It will then become increasingly obsolete in certain situations to hold value and pay with other forms of money. Particularly when fungibility and security meet the digital world.
Let’s go bitcoin empire

I think you have a legitimate claim though and you are on the right direction! After briefly looking into available research, it’s ridiculous that there isn’t an updated estimate that measures total unique bitcoin users. Further, I think it is valid to somehow quantify the speculative characteristics of these bitcoin users as time passes.
Basically, this is what we’re working with though. 
[Blau Research](  - main claim is that speculative trading was not found responsible for price movements/volatility in bitcoin. The issue is that a lot of people join the crypto herd during these isolated time periods where massive price swings occur.  
Again, we have to classify users. I think one good piece of data to know is when they first joined cryptocurrency, you may be able to prove that bitcoin users as a group are generally more speculative based as time moves forward. You could look at scraped reddit data from cryptocurrency communities and analyze sentiment and date joined reddit. Compare the btc community sentiment/keywords over time? Idk haha. So many questions with bitcoin, you can literally go a million different directions. Best topic. And best of luck! :)

TLDR - censorship resistance is the exemplary quality of bitcoin, and moreover cryptocurrencies as a whole. 
True on a physical sense - hashpower. The amount of hashpower required to change/censor a transaction on bitcoin is enormous. Requires massive amounts of electricity (money+access), computing power (money), and most importantly the majority consensus of the whole bitcoin network (time-scaled differentiator of the 2 previous pieces). The ledger itself is resistant to censorship.
But on the other hand, the author mentions thing like drugs and the sex trade as profiting from this censorship resistance. “Breaking laws” ... You can’t really conflate censorship resistance with a semi-anonymous system whose onboarding is being mauled by KYC and traditional financial restrictions. Every bitcoin purchased can be tracked, and will be tracked, by definition.

As for your comment, I think both market cap and order book are useful in evaluating a potential market.
Order book may display some notion of instant liquidity. This may tell you something about the risk market makers are willing to take.
Market cap could potentially tell a more accurate story in terms of long term holders/user base/velocity.
I would argue that both variables are important in any analysis, but if one is looking to turn a short term trade then order book is probably more important, sure.

Did you read the Mueller report? Or did you trust someone to interpret it for you? 
The whole point of my post is that both sides of the political spectrum must trust other sources to read and interpret the information for them. Left interpreted it one way, right interpreted it another. Both used media to try to spread their narrative.
Right typically uses social media bots to spread their narrative, left tries to stop this and likewise use bots to spread their message.
However research shows that those on the left are much less susceptible than people on the right to this social media shitstorm of propaganda. For example, a report on Facebook showed that old people were 8x more likely to share fake news on their feed. If I take a random 75 year old and say “guess this person’s political party”, more often than not they are conservative. More often than not, they read these fake propaganda pieces and spread them to be true, just as you were trying to do with your unverified piece on Mueller’s supposed exoneration of trump. 
Im not getting into a political debate with you about the merits of the Mueller report, or whether or not it exonerated trump, simply stating the real reason you were probably banned was that bots that spread fake news are more effective coming from people from the right.

This is so true! Trading Bitcoin for **ideas** is dangerous, particularly when the whole blockchain space is ‘new’ and ‘exciting’ to you. Entering crypto full-bore is like discovering the lightbulb for the first time, rational financial decisions aren’t congruent with the excitement at hand.
My advice: take 10% of the BTC and trade/use the existing centralized exchanges and available decentralized exchanges. You’ll learn how to operate within multiple blockchains/trading systems, discover how the centralized exchanges always rip you off, and how Bitcoin’s ‘drawbacks’ are really its best features. 
It will quell thoughts of dumping your money into people that aren’t worth it.
Learning how the crypto landscape operates as of right now will make you appreciate Bitcoin **that much more**

None of this garbage will survive. The only ones that will are the ones that can effectively serve as an exchange of arbitrary assets. 
The use case of blockchain is a consensus-verified ledger. The innovation plainly is that all users can “trust” the mathematical iterations and work required to update the ledger.
In bitcoin’s case, of all cryptos it has the most “anchored” and “trusted” real-world connections to convert said arbitrary asset into fiat money or other shitcoins. —&gt; social trust.
It also has the highest hash rate, so one can assume the mathematical trust for changing the ledger exists untampered. —&gt; mathematical trust
Every “killer-app” that has advanced bitcoin adoption has been a centralized exchange. Prove me wrong. Gox, BitFinex, Binance. These have nothing to do with mathematical trust, but all to do with innovations in social trust. They come and go, Bitcoin doesn’t.
Not to shill, but Stellar right now is light years ahead of anyone else in that they have developed the combination of a verified consensus mechanism, and are developing the social infrastructure for anchors (temporal social-trust gatherers) to come and go as human interest changes and innovation occurs.
Stellar has a more innovative consensus mechanism than bitcoin does, period. This ultimately leads to 2-5 second tx times and extraordinarily low tx fees while maintaining decentralization. 
Do I think stellar will beat bitcoin out in the near future? Hell no. Bitcoin is so deeply rooted it is insane. But eventually? Something will beat bitcoin.

I respect the Nano plug lol, so I’ll respectfully reply and upvote you. Apparently this matters, so YES I OWN BTC, JESUS RELAX PEOPLE.
Faster and no fees helps the “social-trust” entities/projects produce useful products on chain. Nano is great for this, sure, and will likely have cool projects and use-cases because of it. But Nano jeopardizes the entire point of having a blockchain in the first place...a secure trust-less ledger. [Why believe some idiot on Reddit though?]( 
The whole point of my post was that there is an innate trade-off between security and innovative properties like speed and cost reduction. Nano sacrifices ledger security in a different way than Stellar does. Bitcoin has the policy of never sacrificing security ever. These are different policies that I think deserve some discussion.
I’m not saying Stellar’s consensus mechanism is perfect nor prone to centralization. But if I say a damn thing that doesn’t involve the Moon or Craig Wright, I get downvoted?

Imagine that they pay in imaginary token KrakenWorkUSD, to an agreed upon rate like $8,333 per month. 
This KrakenWorkUSD can be traded by the employee, for bitcoin, at any rate they choose.
This not only creates ‘buying pressure’ on bitcoin (increasing the price), but essentially allows Kraken to trade their stagnant and non-profitable BTC (resulting from a fractional reserve policy that all centralized exchanges use) for more labor in their business.
If this is the case, Kraken is basically saying to their employees - do this work for me, I’ll give you a representative token of payment. You can choose to turn that token into bitcoin, and it won’t have a negative fiscal harm on me. Or, you can wait and speculate on bitcoin to try and get a lower price, in which Kraken wont have to pay anything and essentially gets labor on margin/credit.
It’s brilliant.

1) The only people lobbying for bitcoin are those who can profit from it. They probably don’t have your best interest, or your same enthusiasm for decentralization, at heart. 
2) Bitcoin is a compliment to fiat, not a substitute. It isn’t a threat to fiat whatsoever. The technological advantages BTC maintains over fiat can all be replicated by a state entity, delegated to a more widespread audience in an instant, and implemented with rule of law. 
We must assume that humans make rational decisions grounded in game theory. In terms of currency this means innovating by borrowing the technology underlying Bitcoin, not adopting Bitcoin as a brand.
“Fiat” has long been a mechanism for maintaining political power. By establishing currencies as a hypothetical representation of the fruit of all labor and production by human beings, the output of this labor and production are thus quantified, managed, and distributed by a central entity. Social control and political leverage is an externality of centralized money production. 
Sure, I dream of that Kumbayah moment when the dominating world leaders get together and decide they want to hand the mechanism of their power over to a bunch of 20 year old reddit dudes and computer nerds, but I’m not naive enough to think it will go down like that. 
You can lobby all you want, but these facts still remain: 
-As a medium of exchange, Bitcoin is technologically superior to fiat transactions only due to decentralized and trust-less verification of electronic transactions. That’s it. That’s the magic sauce of exchange. 
-Compared to other cryptocurrencies, Bitcoin is advantageous mainly due to its “widespread” adoption and acceptance, and ability to actually converted into fiat by multiple trusted entities.
-Fiat could absolutely crush the entire crypto market if it wanted to, just by buying OTC and maliciously selling on exchanges. The IRS takes in $3,400,000,000,000 every single year. Let all those 0’s sink in. 3.4T. Pretty obvious but that amount of buying and selling power outweighs your average Sunday-Night-Binance-Trader. (Also the name of my new shitty ICO, SNBT. Buy now for a 750% token bonus, on top of the already 300% early bird bonus as well as the 187% hodl bonus)
I am hoping for the widespread adoption of decentralized methods to help regulate manipulatable systems. I hope the world becomes a better place and develops a more honest and fair distribution of resources through decentralized mechanisms.
