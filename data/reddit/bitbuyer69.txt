that would not be good.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 21:02:42
Eh - they canceled all the orders.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:34:36
good word
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:39:10
Coinbase does not allow limit buys, or I would have done that, and done it at precise levels.  Nothing haphazard about it
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:59:54
Update:  Coinbase actually *did* end up cancelling all of these transactions a moment ago, but evidently not because of the size of the buys, but because I had sent some bitcoin to nitrogensports.eu in the past.  Because gambling is illegal in the US, it is against their terms to use bitcoin from coinbase in this way.  And in that I didn't actually *read* their Terms in great detail, I of course cannot fault them in taking action.  I was surprised, but hey, it's their company.  
Once the money all gets refunded, I'll initiate some buys of the same amount so long as we're still in a good trading range.  Some reps from other coin companies have already reached out with offers that beat coinbase. 
Given the current price, I'm right at about even from my mix of buys, so all-in-all it's a wash for now.  
I'll update this post or make a new one once the money is returned and I purchase elsewhere.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:13:32
Wasn't impulsive.  Have had my finger on the trigger for a couple of months now.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:21:44
Thanks.  I'm glad to see strong volume today above the $200 mark.  We may re-test that $160 level, but things are looking a bit more stable today for sure.  
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:23:04
Quick Update:  I've managed to build up a $25K position now after all the refunds settled from Coinbase.  My cost basis is higher now, of course (around $225 instead of the $208), but hey, I'm still pleased.  Will round out another $25K worth of buys soon.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:43:36
Thanks BitCol.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:04:36
What a fun day we've all had together.  
I did one final buy at $180 for 25 coins to round out the day.  Looking forward to seeing where things go over the next couple of weeks.  
I'll keep this post updated if I buy more or sell any of this core position.  Best of luck to you all.

@_date: 2015-01-14 20:18:46
I don't know, actually.  I've done tons of very small transactions in the past (&lt;1btc), so maybe it has to do with transaction volume.  No clue.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:28:45
Like a beagle.
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:58:31
To the upside, I'll likely sell some in stages if it gets above $300 or so.  
To the downside, probably none.  Little value in panicking at $50.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:29:46
In addition to investment, I actively use it a couple times a week.  It solves a couple problems for me, and I suspect that it will solve problems for more people in the future. 
I believe that by actively using it as well as holding it as an investment, I can best support the overall ecosystem 
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:00:17
It's probably a mix of the two.  
It makes no sense that you would say that I would have to sell to lower my risk, though.  I'm all-in on risk here.  There are no hedges in place.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:28:28
I consider stocks, funds, cash, etc. all liquid.  Not all in cash.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:28:17
Lots of technicals, yes.  I don't know if it will go too much higher, but I don't think it will go too much lower. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:33:35
Unless that crisis finds a bunch of believers with $40K to invest.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:44:18
Yeah I use them because I don't know a better option that I'm comfortable buying that much through. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:10:38
Maybe I bought yours?
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:01:18
That'd be a good tactic if it was.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:25:31
Thanks man.  I don't come from much, but have done well with my entrepreneurial ventures lately, and feel very grateful for that.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:24:51
I've been watching for the past few months and have done a few small buys, but went in full-bore in the last 24 hours.  I'll keep averaging down to $150, but I suspect that we're nearing the lows.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:31:29
coinbase primarily because that's what I have.  If anyone knows of a better way to buy that has high limits and isn't sketchy, let me know. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:36:55
Thanks.  Haven't always had it.  Glad I did today.

@_date: 2015-01-14 20:01:56
Good on you.  Probably will take another few weeks to see if we were on the right side, I suspect
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:55:55
worked for 10 years straight building my own company.  sold it for some cash.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:22:57
Let it be made clear that I don't entirely know what I'm doing, but here's my thinking:
1.  Chart:  There was a long plateau in the $120 range and then a short plateau in the $180 range before it went berserk.  We're testing that $180 range now and had a dip down to $160 on a market order.  I believe the $120 range is a strong, foundational base and the real base will form between there and $180.  There may indeed be a flash crash that flushes out a bunch of orders (or there may be an insane 50K market sell that flushes deeper), but this range looks pretty stable. 
2.  Despair vs. Shoulder Shrug:  In stock market situations, total despair creeps in because there aren't people who actually use the paper on which the stock certificates are printed.  In this case, too many people believe in the actual utility of this technology (and they use it day-to-day) for it to go to zero in the near-term.  Many people *should* be showing signs of total despair right now, but the positive sign to me is that many of the people here are doing a kind of chuckle and shoulder shrug.  That is a positive.  
3. Mainstream uses:  There are a bunch of guys like me who didn't ever actually use bitcoin because it didn't solve a problem.  I like to play poker online, for instance, but *hated* sending in deposits and the pain/sketchiness of cashouts.  When I discovered how easy nitrogensports is, I found a huge value, and it made me a believer.  I'm now looking not only for other ways to use bitcoin day-to-day, but how to support the ecosystem.  As bitcoin starts to solve problems of more mainstream users like myself, they will start to see the value in actually holding bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:29:16
cash money, playa.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:11:57
It looks like the post did get 97K views, so maybe you are right...
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:55:53
True, but I'd probably have chosen a higher number
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:35:47
Ah.  No this "pending" simply refers to the forced waiting period Coinbase enforces before the coin actually shows up in the wallet.  The price-per-coin and total sale amount are finalized at time of purchase. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 00:22:03
exactly. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:14:57

@_date: 2015-01-15 14:07:20
Thx! Nice to see volume high again today.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:37:19
Thanks miner.  I suspect there are other guys like me with $100K or so ready to invest.  I think there will be tons more volatility before there is a true bottom, but it's interesting here for sure. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:20:16
Ha.  I should have clarified.  The investors most likely get a monthly investor deck that has full details on trends going on in the industry, who has/hasn't reached out to them, what off-book transactions are going-on and what types of people are behind them, what hardware is being built, trends in offline storage, etc. etc.  This is *extremely* valuable to a news company or banking company or anyone in any industry impacted by digital currency. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:12:51
Well...they actually ended up cancelling all the orders and are in-process of refunding all the money.  I've since then opened up a new account at an alternate company and am moving funds there.  The price isn't as good as what I was getting on that dip, but I plan on scaling in a position over the next 7 days once the funds get cleared.  From there, I'll hold 3-6 months at least. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:43:52
Remains to be seen...
@_date: 2015-01-14 18:34:42
I can afford to lose all of it.  I'm not rich (probably about $750K net worth), but like Bitcoin as an investment at these levels vs. what I perceive to be a very risky stock market at the moment.  I'd be disappointed if it went to zero, but the chart looks pretty good at this point. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:20:04
First learned about it in late 2012.  Bought first coin (to use, not hold) mid 2013.  Prior to the last 24 hours, I did not hold a significant position.  Have been an active user of it for 5-6 months.
@_date: 2015-01-26 01:54:17
Man - it just hit $275.  Looks like I did actually get close to the bottom on those buys!  My average of $225 through other providers is just fine, though
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:35:17
That's all?  Figured it'd be worse.  
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:14:19
Congrats.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:42:26
Luck to us both. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:51:03
Most technical analysis is faulty, true.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:02:12
I expect it to get worse overnight, as well.  
@_date: 2015-01-20 19:01:42
Note:  Oftentimes people/companies invest in companies NOT primarily to get a return, but so they get the data and can ask for an inside look at everything going on in the industry. 
So NYT invest, Citigroup dude invest, some big bank invests, etc. - the information they get out of laying down a couple million is worth WAY more than the invested capital.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:27:25
I have, and you are correct.  I define rich as being able to support the ones I love and the projects I care about w/o ever having to work again.  $750K doesn't come close to that. 
But yes, I am in a very fortunate position, I realize!
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:21:42
Thanks - it's looking quite nice here.  I wouldn't be surprised if it re-tested 160-ish in a big market sell, but I don't expect there will be many days below 200 in the near term.
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:20:26
Hey guys - it's been fun.  Gonna head out for the day, but will check back in tonight.  Good luck to all. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:29:02
I use it on a couple of sites, but mainly as an investment. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:20:58
Yeah wasn't talking about that - of course that's free.  Was talking about all the context, deals, expertise that they have at their fingertips now as investors.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 21:08:58
If I sell and do so for a differential of &gt;10% or so, yes.

[let me google that for you](
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:41:42
Thanks Jones, yeah that's why I decided to create an account and post.  The general public thinks bitcoin is just some game the nerds are playing, but there are a lot of tech-knowledgeable guys like me who are watching and close to hitting 'buy'.  But sometimes you just gotta post the damn trade.
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:06:54
Nope - I'd look for it to get well above $300 before I'd see much value in selling (given transaction fees, capital gain reporting, etc.).  Further, I don't need the cash at the moment, so I'll most likely just keep on holding to see how it plays out.  I also actively use bitcoin day-to-day, so some of it may go out in to the ecosystem a bit as well.  
I'm just happy to have cleared some major buys below $200.  We may indeed drop well below that again, but for now it's looking like a good initial buy.
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:45:15
I use bitcoin more often than I use oil.  
And I trust the guys who are investing in bitcoin-related companies and technology more than I trust the people behind global oil politics. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:24:14
Nice.  I'm targeting 500 or so in the short term, but will scale up to 1000 over time if it looks like it's seeing a base above $225 or so again. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 14:05:21
Lots of people watching if they do...
@_date: 2015-01-15 17:30:44
I'll be sure to update it
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:36:26
Yeah I should probably figure out my next buy point.  Probably at $140 *or* $225
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:30:51
Indeed.  I haven't yet figured out my sell points.  I'll likely sell 20% if it goes up 50%, but probably not the other way around.  
@_date: 2015-01-14 20:07:49
it's a trap
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:53:17
Now that's closer.  :-)
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:57:13
Thanks Bat.  Let's see how it plays out. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:47:29
Not sure that's how it works.  I make an initial buy when I think it's nearing the bottom, then I fill the rest of the position when the downtrend has reversed without question. 
@_date: 2015-01-14 19:49:13
Yeah I don't think I'll buy much more until downtrend reversal is confirmed.  I'm likely done for now.
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:46:55
I do, but am not going to provide screenshots or a way to confirm, sorry!  
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:56:34
Thx.  Yeah I even keep my trezor and keys in different states just to force my own laziness to keep me from selling unless I get on two different planes.  
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:50:54
I will as I am able.  For the moment, I'd like to see a solid base built above 250, but that may not happen for awhile.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:31:00
Eh - I don't think it's distasteful at all, primarily because it's so speculative.  I post because there's a huge void in knowing who is actually holding/believing in btc.  Talking about it puts somewhat of a face on it for people who likely don't know any other IRL holders.  (I certainly do not). 
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:36:17
Not the length, not the size, just as long...as bitcoin rise.  
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:48:46
Yeah have been watching it closely since 350-ish and took my first jump during the crash (or tried to).  I'm not yet sure that the timing is superb, but given that I plan on holding for 18+ months at least, having a steady buy plan gets the job done.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:27:09
Agreed.  Which is why I offer no proof of any kind.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:34:18
I'd most likely make a point to keep fewer than 25BTC in a single wallet, and may even go so far as to tumble almost all transfers.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:31:44
Thaaaanks - time will tell!
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:27:29
I certainly was for a good portion of my life.  
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:48:33
Yep saw the other posts and felt compelled to share.  I'd love for a few more people like myself to take the plunge, but it's quite difficult to get people to jump in, especially with the tracking funds coming out.  It's not simple to buy and store a bunch of BTC
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:01:47
I just buy and hold, and occasionally place some bets with it if I feel strongly about a team/game/odds.  I don't actually know any other holders in real life, so I can't really provide services for it, but you should look in to that if you do. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:09:14
Buying steadily since end of January.  Highest price 295, lowest 212.  For storage, have multiple hot and cold - mixed across blockchain, hive, trezor, paper, and a couple of random ones.  Buying has become a bit more difficult lately, but once you get them, fairly simple to store securely
@_date: 2015-04-18 20:51:47
eh, with this amount of coin, I'd prefer to not reveal where/how various quantities are stored.  No worries if you'd prefer to think this a troll - I probably would too
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:06:26
I've been thinking quite a bit about this, but don't really have anything specific just yet.  I've been toying with the idea of building something that lets BTC zealots introduce their friends to it through some auto-funded social wallets of some sort, but haven't fleshed out the idea just yet.  
It may take a big guy like coinbase/circle to increase their affiliate bounties to really get the effective marketers in.  2015 will be a big year, though, either way.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:45:49
I appreciate the suggestion and it is dead on.  I'll update if I end up doing any apps or anything around some of these ideas.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:44:55
This.  I continue to believe that the mid-term future of BTC will be supported largely by mid-tier guys like me getting interested and knowing just enough to secure actual BTC in larger blocks.  With all of these tracking funds and ETFs coming out, the investment community is being a bit alarmist about the dangers of holding actual coin.  BTC may benefit more by having 100 or so guys each buying up 1000BTC directly, especially before 2016 halving.  
@_date: 2015-04-19 03:27:50
Me too - if it'd only drop to 150 for a few days!
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:43:26
There's a very good reason to post this:  It's important for people to know that there are holders out there who have invested quite a bit in BTC.  The same goes for people who make substantial bets against it.  
@_date: 2015-04-18 22:08:28
dat a whole lotta money. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 21:35:32
Blockchain is mainly a hotwallet for me.  Sub 25btc.  
Will look in to Armory and Electrum for future buys/storage.  
@_date: 2015-03-16 18:58:13
Hey all.  Fairly well.  I sold some around 280, then bought a few more around 240, and I'm building a full position now over the next week or so.  It seems like we're poised to make a strong move above 300 soon, but i'd live to see 200s a bit longer.
