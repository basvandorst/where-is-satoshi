He’s a troll
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:17:05
Read his post history.  You’ll be surprised how quickly your question will be answered.
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:19:13
I love how triggered you kiddos get.  It makes me hard
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:56:18
Lol, not really 
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:20:33
Good thing BCash and Bitcoin Cash aren’t the same thing �� 
It’s always amusing watching you little kiddos have a breakdown over such trivial things
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:34:08
I love how easily it triggers you delusional little boys in this sub.  
Keep feeding Big Daddy those salty tears.  ��
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:25:21
It’s adorable watching you try so hard.  
Keep going, little guy.  Give Big Daddy something to touch himself to
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:57:22
Not Bcash.  Just Bitcoin Cash :-)
Bcash is not the same thing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 12:39:00
You were just abbreviating it incorrectly 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:39:23
Pretty stupid analogy.  Try again, little guy.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:10:14
Bitcoin Cash*
@_date: 2017-12-05 02:47:41
Wrong on both definitions, little buddy.  Look up “job” and get back to me.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:44:33
I’ll ask again:  what is a “real” job?

How much of that went to fees?

What is a fake job?

Alright, little buddy.  You’ve made it clear that you’re an idiot.  You don’t need to keep spamming the same stupid comment.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:53:29
Was he in a paid position of regular employment?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:55:17
I have no money in BTC or BCH, little guy.  Doesn’t affect me at all ��
@_date: 2018-09-12 15:43:13
No...  it hasn’t

You may want to look up the definition of “job,” kiddo.

So you’re not referring to Bitcoin Cash then?
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:00:55
Regardless of your erroneous reasoning skills, you and your peasant friends are still wrong.  I love how triggered you little kiddos get.  I masturbate to your salty tears

What is an imaginary job?

Nope, You’re still wrong, kiddo ��������
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:51:36
That is not what ROI is.

Strange how jokes don’t translate well through text.
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:15:14
What’s Theter?
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:22:55
What’s Bcash?

Bitcoin Cash*
@_date: 2018-09-07 01:01:01
It’s not intended for shilling.  Just for people to ELI5 the complexities of their cryptos.
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:53:27
And 3 months later, the transaction will clear.  
And they only had to pay 40% in fees!  
Hail Bitcoin

[Here you go, champ.  Bcash and Bitcoin Cash are not the same thing.  Go find a corner for you and your delusional little buddies to cry in.](  ������

(U.S.) Just so everyone's aware, it appears you are liable for capital gains taxation not only for cashing out, but also for trading one crypto for another.  I sent them an email last week for clarification, but haven't received an answer yet.  This is just something to be cognizant of.

No you didn't 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:46:28
Is there an official source I can get this info?  Do they have deadlines for anything?

~~I'm still learning about Bitcoin.  It's strange how people on this sub are so quick to get defensive.~~
~~I wasn't sure if it was a major upgrade or not, so I asked you to explain.  That's all.~~
Edit: Thanks!

Why would you rather be obese after not having a Ferrari??  
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:05:25
Would you mind explaining the significance and what effect it should have?

I’m hoping to have enough for the Tesla Roadster in 2020.  600+ mile range and 0-60 in 1.9 seconds

@_date: 2017-11-11 16:21:26
Serious question as I'm a hopeful newbie since I bought $675 worth of BTC around $7,300ish:  What value does BTC hold over BCH or other alternatives?  Are there plans to make BTC cheaper and faster in the future?  If not, what is its place in the crypto realm?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:05:53
No harm done.  Thanks for explaining!
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:46:41
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:07:26
Thanks!  This was very informative.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:48:17
Would someone mind writing an ELI5 summary for those of us who aren't so savvy?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:56:57
When did BCH reach .5 BTC?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:37:56
I'm sure the subject has been beaten to death, but I'm new.  There is a massive amount of information for me to absorb.  I appreciate your patience.
Will future, cheaper transactions be dependent on miners?  If the fees are so low, what's their incentive to continue mining Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:19:28
Hopefully I didn't just lose my $800 purchase...
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:33:06
@_date: 2017-11-12 01:28:38
Thanks again!
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:28:56
The informative part was the first two paragraphs.  The rest was amusing.
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:33:49
