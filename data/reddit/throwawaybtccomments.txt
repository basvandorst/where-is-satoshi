Might be good to say that Local BTC is technically illegal in the U.S.

Any US regulated financial institution can request information from another institution through something called the 314(b) information sharing program. If your debit card company contacted an exchange to ask where the funds were going they are legally protected from reprisals if they share said information in support of an investigation.

Definitions of User, Exchanger, and Administrator
This guidance refers to the participants in generic virtual currency arrangements, using the terms "user," "exchanger," and "administrator."6 A user is a person that obtains virtual currency to purchase goods or services. 7 An exchanger is a person engaged as a business in the exchange of virtual currency for real currency, funds, or other virtual currency. 
An administrator or exchanger that (1) accepts and transmits a convertible virtual currency or (2) buys or sells convertible virtual currency for any reason is a money transmitter under FinCEN's regulations, unless a limitation to or exemption from the definition applies to the person.10 FinCEN's regulations define the term "money transmitter" as a person that provides money transmission services, or any other person engaged in the transfer of funds. The term "money transmission services" means "the acceptance of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency from one person and the transmission of currency, funds, or other value that substitutes for currency to another location or person by any means."11
tldr: Persons exchanging real currency for virtual currency are considered to be money transmitters. Money transmitters are required to be registered and maintain AML programs. If you engage in money transmission without said registration and program you are violating federal law. 
I used to be a regulator, they are prosecuting people who sell on Local BTC, do yourself a favor and read up on the law before you inadvertently break it.

They do have an exemption for providers of prepaid access (&lt;$1k per person per day) but not for money transmitters. See sections 4 and 5 of the law here: 
This is an unusual law because the intent doesn't matter. I would guess that many if not most people on Local BTC don't know that they could be prosecuted (if they live in the U.S. and some European countries). Local BTC should probably disclose it. Of course, only the biggest traders are likely to draw attention to themselves.

What country are you connecting from?

And people are welcome to engage in civil disobedience and violate the law if they so choose, they just need to be prepared for the consequences. There are a lot of people who just tell bitcoin newbies to go straight to engaging in activity that the government considers illegal. It is irresponsible to not give them the full facts so they can make an informed decision.

You just have to buy through a licensed MSB. Smaller exchanges among friends are also not likely to draw any attention. If you are making it a side business through Local BTC you may eventually draw law enforcement attention.
Think about it - the entire Local BTC model is essentially designed to evade AML requirements. Obviously the government is not going to let that fly.

Think it might have something to do with your numerous posts in r/fakeID?

A reversal meaning that you called in and reversed a transaction after you initiated it or you reported one of your cards as stolen? Sounds like they are justified in holding onto the funds for a bit.

Trust me on this, there are no exemptions and Local BTC is illegal in the U.S. 
Use it at your own risk.

Pro tip - the following citation from your site is for "dealers in foreign exchange". Paragraph (ff)(5) is actually the applicable section. 
Coqui Firearms Training (coqui33) is not a “money services business” under U.S. federal regulations or under Florida law Chapter 560. According to CFR, Title 31, Subtitle B, Section 1010.100 (Chapter X, Part 1010, Subpart A 31 CFR 1010.100), General definitions, “Money services business” under paragraph (ff)(1) reads:
“Currency dealer or exchanger. — A currency dealer or exchanger (other than a person who does not exchange currency in an amount greater than $1,000 in currency or monetary or other instruments for any person on any day in one or more transactions).”
TLDR - All Local Bitcoins activity is classified as money transmission in the United States.

Any regulated entity will not let you use a prepaid card due to anti money laundering controls

Money transmitter licenses are not required in every state but every person or company engaging in money transmitter activity must be registered with FinCEN. Once registered, they must maintain an AML program that meets FinCEN standards.
Operating an unlicensed MSB generally requires a SAR filing and it is illegal to "tip off" an individual who is under investigation for suspicious activity. That would be your gag order.
It also doesn't matter where you are - if you are using an American company they have to comply with American laws and regulations. Most major AML rules are identical in the developed world anyway (due to FATF standards).
