There isn't $70B worth of bitcoin in the world. The market cap for cryptocurrencies can't be used like that.
And why would a higher market cap make a crypto currency a better store of value? Problem is, a high market cap doesn't reduce the volatility.

The utility of Bitcoin hasn't been keeping up with the price of Bitcoin. People are not investing in Bitcoin because of its tech (there are other cryptocurrencies with better tech). They invest money because they hope others are going to continue investing even more.  That means speculation is mostly based on the [Greater Fool]( principle, and that there is a high risk of a crash. Taking home some profits is a good investment philosophy.

You are confusing two things here, "verification" and "validation".
Miners validate transactions. As soon as a miner has done this, you have them (if you are the receiver).
Running a node without mining help you verify your own transactions. But they can go through anyway. You can look up your transaction in a blockchain explorer. This is of course not "trust less", but is never  a problem unless there is a major 51% attack ongoing.

It depends on the definition of  "virtual". Bitcoin is definitely not a physical object, which means it is virtual.
Speaking of definitions, there are theories that there is no "reality" out there. It is just something that our minds try to interpret. Which means all reality really is virtual (your interpretation). In the quantum world, we know there are things (events) that only exist if you observe them.

As usual, there are two sides of this coin. The value is deflationary if demand grows faster than supply, which is currently the case.
Bitcoin issuance, on the other hand, is inflationary as long as there are more coins issued than lost, which will be the case for a while.
So it is wrong to state either it is "deflationary" or "inflationary", it depends on the context.

Actually, it slows down the network more than it helps. You add another hop, increasing the chance that a transaction or block has to go through your node instead of directly to the miner.
It is good to have "enough" nodes to ensure some local failure or censoring can't stop the network.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:04:20
I hope this will be improved some day. There are other cryptocurrencies where you have full security even if you run a light node. The same technology should be possible to use.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:14:01
If you are a miner, and just use the standard node, you will connect to 8 other nodes. That means the chance is very small that you would connect to another miner. And it gets smaller the more nodes there are.
I don't know whether big miners establish special connections to each other. It would profit them, so I would suppose they do. The main reason is that it decreases the chance that you produce orphaned blocks.

Actually, anyone can create money like this and make a profit from it!
If you lend $100 to me, I'll give you an IOU note that says I owe you $100. (You could use this IOU note and pay with, everywhere they trust notes signed by me).
At this point, you have created $100 worth of money. You are not stealing money from anyone when you do this.
When bookkeeping, the books always have to be balanced. That is, credit has to match debit. In the above transaction, You would have an IOU asset worth $100, but there would also be the credit of $100, so it balances. However, money is defined as all credits. Not as the balance between credits and debits. That is why the amount of money increased above, because the total credits increased.
Now let's take this to the next step. You are doing a service when you lend $100 to me, and you want to get paid for that service. I agree, and the solution is that I give you an IOU of $105 instead of $100, and added the condition that you are entitled to get $105 back in one year from me. At this point, we haven't only created money, you also make a profit from it.
This is usually legal in most countries up to a certain point. You can lend money to friends and family, but if you make a living of it, you need to register it as a bank. When it comes to lending out the same money again (Fraction Reserve Banking), there are special rules.
The difference between a commercial bank and a central bank, is that the commercial bank has to have the $100 to start with. The central bank doesn't.

When you, as a customer, use a vendor that accepts payments through Bitpay, you can pay with bitcoin. But this kind of service is limited to the transaction throughput because it is done onchain.
When a vendor uses Coinbase, it is the same. However, in this case, you will also be given the option to pay through the Coinbase home page. That works if you have an account on Coinbase and a bitcoin available. That transaction would be done offchain.


You aren't a Bitpay or Coinbase customer. You are a customer to a vendor, that indirectly uses these services. Try buying a game on Steam with Bitcoin, and you will understand how it works.

Sure, you could issue the usual stock shares also.
When doing an ICO like this, there are a couple of advantages:
1. Using a blockchain token, you can reach an international audience. And the cost for that is no more than it would have been for a national audience.

Sounds like a tautology to me. Seriously though, what is the connection between the value of the Bitcoin blockchain to the price of a bitcoin? And then, I am not talking about the market cap, as I  assume you weren't.


Bitcoin is a poor store of value. It has 4% inflation and a high volatility. Most fiats in developed countries are better.


It is about to happen (in October), so it remains to see if it is followed by an increased adoption. Probably not an immediate one, as the current blocks aren't full (except sporadically). Just a technicality, but the possible TPS increase doesn't come from increased block size, but from decreased block time.

Agreed. But how many need that? Only a very small subset of bitcoin owners run full nodes today, and wouldn't ever think about it. Of the coin holders, I would say 0,0% or something like that would benefit from running a node. It is rare indeed the cases where you need 100% security. And then, you don't get 100% even if you run a full node. There can be a chain split, and it is usually recommended to wait for 6 confirmations, or something like that.

This was about using Bitcoin as a store of value, not as an investment. These are different things. The inflation is a fact, it is not a matter of belief. That most fiats in developed countries also have lower inflation than 4% is also a fact.

An Ethereum node doesn't use 80% CPU. I know, because I run one. Even though it is on a powerful CPU, it is almost not noticeable.


Still negligible.


The chain is less than [23 GB]( when it is pruned. That is something like 100 MB/day the last 7 days. You might argue that a pruned chain isn't secure, but for Ethereum it is just as secure as downloading and saving all history.


Fast sync is very quick, while still being [just as secure]( That is one key factor that enables Ethereum to scale much better than Bitcoin.

That is the old false dichotomy argument that has been debunked again and again. Sure, you can't increase block size without limits. But that doesn't mean one doubling now isn't feasible.
@_date: 2017-10-22 11:24:18
He got it right and wrong. The law that the value of the network grows by the square of the number of users applies to users, as in users of transactions. That is, every time the number of users double, there are four times the number of possible transactions, so the value of the network grows by 4. However, this is only valid if the number of transactions can grow. But there is fierce opposition to allow an onchain increase.
Then we have the growth of value because the number of coin holders double. If the number of passive coin holder doubles, assuming they all want to invest an equal amount, the price of bitcoin will double. Not go up by a factor of 4. So this is not a network effect, it is linear.
This is a fatal flaw in his analysis. And then, it is generally recognized that the growth isn't the square of the number of users, it is n\*log(n) after the network has reached a certain size.


That is not counting the mining fees. A value of $100,000 would mean that the cost of simply running the network would be 12.5\*6\*24\*100k = $180 million per day. So no, that is not feasible, even if factoring in the next halving.

Will a higher TPS improve Bitcoin? Maybe it depends on who you ask. If all other things are equal, a higher TPS is better, of course. It all boils down to knock-ons from increasing the limit, and I suppose that is where you find the big rift in communities.
The fact that there are other cryptocurrencies that can manage higher TPS means also Bitcoin should be able to do it. If the Bitcoin technology doesn't support it, the the technology should be improved. Otherwise, Bitcoin may fall behind eventually.
A couple of years ago, there was no serious  competition to Bitcoin. Frequently when a new idea was voiced, with a suggestion to launch a new cryptocurrency, the answer was that Bitcoin can evolve and incorporate that idea if it turns out to be good enough. Let the other cryptocurrency explore the technology, and then incorporate it.

Excuse me for misunderstanding what you said. I agree it would be possible for miners to spam for free, if the block isn't full.

The central bank doesn't create money for itself. Money is created in the process where it is loaned to someone (usually commercial banks and sometimes as quantitative easings).

@_date: 2018-12-25 18:44:47


It might, but it is contrary to the responsibility of central banks.
Money isn't the only asset. There are real estate, corporations, commodities, and much more. The idea is to have the total value of all these non-monetary assets have the same value as money. If they are in balance, there will be price stability. The assets will exactly match up with the debts.


The central banks set the interest rate so as to match the growth of all these non-monetary assets. That way, the idea is to always have a balance. For example, if the total value of all assets is expected to grow by 3% next year, the central banks can set the interest rate on money to 3%. If the system is in balance today, it should still be in balance in a year.


It can, but only as long as there is a corresponding growth. One day, growth will have to slow down. At that day, the interest rate will also have to go down correspondingly.

If you own coins in a cryptocurrency based on POS, you earn no dividends. You have to do some work to get revenue from it. E.g. you have to run a node, stake your money, and participate as a validator.
A cryptocurrency based on POS pays no dividends. Compare this with the stock market. You don't need to do anything with your shares, they will simply pay dividends anyway (directly, or indirectly by doing buy-backs).

Everyone knows you lose buying power when there is price inflation. But monetary inflation doesn't have to mean there has to be price inflation.

That is rather obvious to most people, but I'll help you understand.
Growth is usually measured in GDP. Suppose you double the number of individuals, it means the GDP will also double (all other things equal). That means you need twice as much money to support the economy.
In the same way, if the production of goods and services increase, all things equal, you also need more money. Sure, there are complications as the change of velocity of money, etc, but I think you get the point.

It is you that claim something, and so it is up to you to prove your point. Anyway, I'll bite the bullet.
First example: The market cap of Bitcoin is approximately $66 billion today. That doesn't mean that $66 billion has been invested in Bitcoin. There are 0 (zero) dollars invested in total in bitcoin the currency! That is easy to understand if you consider a transaction. If I invest $1000 in bitcoin and pays it to you, your total investments fall by $1000. So the total investment is always 0. The reason is that there isn't any account somewhere, where you can find the investments.
Second example: The market cap is defined as the last price times the number of coins. Theoretically, if I buy 0.01 btc for $100 (there is certainly someone that will accept that price), the market cap will, at that exact point, be 21 million*10000=$210 billion! From a small negligible transaction, the whole market cap is defined. Of course, it is an unlikely case. A more common case is sharp temporary movements because someone enters a big buy order. The temporary change of market cap is much bigger than that buy order.
Third example: Suppose I create a new cryptocurrency with 1 billion coins. I sell 0.1 coins to my friend for $10. By definition, this cryptocurrency now has a market cap of $100 billion. What does it tell you of this cryptocurrency? Nothing, whatsoever.

Are you making that up? There is no such rule in democratic countries. Your business can use any currency it wants. However, it usually has to pay taxes and declare revenues in the designated currency.


That is exactly the argument terrorists and extreme left or right wing advocate. To make the world better, we first need a period of chaos. They all have very different goals, but they all agree with your approach.
Why not go the democratic way? If the system is as superior as you say, surely a majority will vote for it?

No, Etherium can't support any lightning network or a similar technology.

No, a higher market cap doesn't mean there are more investments. Care to explain why you believe that?
@_date: 2018-12-23 19:33:15




Ethereum has more transactions than Bitcoin every day.




What has the market cap to do with this? The dollar has a MUCH higher market cap than bitcoin, does it mean it is much better? Fact is, when you analyze currencies, you never care much about market cap.






That is something you are making up on your own. Developed countries don't print money to fund wars. The government has to borrow the money (or use tax), it can't simply print money and use it. Even the US had to borrow the money to fund the second world war.
Some underdeveloped countries have no border between the central bank and the rest of the government. Those are the ones where we see hyperinflation.


You got that wrong. A life time saving, invested in a low risk asset, would give you even more today than a brand new home. That is the point, inflation is easy to compensate for.

It is generally recognized that small inflation should be the best, around 2%. Is this the final verdict? Probably not, but if you read some economy, you will never find anyone saying "more inflation is always better".

Legal tender says that you are can always use it to settle a debt. The creditor must accept legal tender.
That doesn't mean the creditor can't accept other currencies. It is even possible to do bartering, using any kind of commodity as payment.
Of course, there are most probably special rules in some countries.

[Number of transactions per day]( are less than one year ago. It is a stretch to call it "most successful"...

Do you have a Ledger Nano S? Are you absolutely sure you bought it from the original source? Or maybe it was from someone that just looked convincingly as the original source?
And then, people are not very smart. I have heard about people buying second-hand units with pre-defined seeds. That way, you don't have to initialize the seeds yourself. /s

ALL money is printed out of thin air (actually, created as credits), not just some of it. So you either take it all, or none of it.
@_date: 2018-12-27 09:20:17


On the contrary. The history is full of "governments" diluting the coins with cheap metals.
@_date: 2018-12-25 22:00:17


I agree.
It is better to see miners as hired labor. They get paid to do something, and they will continue to do that as long as they get paid enough.
@_date: 2018-12-23 16:51:42
Well then, give me a realistic example where someone lost money because of inflation!

There is no graveyard for dying cryptocurrencies. There is only a last block, which eventually can get very old if there are no one mining it.
But it is always possible to revive a blockchain again.

[ is a game, it doesn't even support a blockchain.

The network effect is indeed a powerful thing, and it might very well be what makes Bitcoin win over other cryptocurrencies.
Usually, the network effect is defined as the value of network proportional to n^(2), where 'n' is the number of users. For big networks, this degrades to n*log(n), which is still very powerful. Notice that 'n' here is the number of users, not coin holders. The interesting caveat is that this means that the network effect only holds as long as the blocks are not full. If they are full, you can't accept more users.
Because of that, there is no longer a network effect for Bitcoin. Well, there may be if the LN picks up volume.
