For real! And they use words like "I think" "I feel" "I'm hopeful" "maybe if" "it's possible". And man listening to roger talk shut about btc and he sounds like someone shit talking their old spouse. "Ohh gosh they're just so bad lately! They didn't do the dishes once and this house is just so darn gosh cluttered all the time��‍♂️

It's weird cause it logged me out then I logged in about 15 min ago, 2fa worked fine and then looked around and only difference I see was as they had listed XBC IN the little side exchange bar����
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:29:19

@_date: 2017-08-06 20:00:59
Sir... if you want them to change their mind. I can almost guarantee if u give them some ($20-50-100) and u will see how quick they will become interested and ask you to buy soon after!

Nice a few more since I checked, but Yea I meant never know if they're doing it for $ or for education or maybe both, either way I sent some cause printing them couldn't be that cheap and I keep seeing them on banks and ATMs downtown ��

Savings fund wallet per child?
Could be a great way to convince them to do well in school, job etc. Reward them for good grades and Let them check on it as often as they like, but put limits for example: can't spend it until they're a certain age or, only allowed to have a certain amount per week or month or year as allowance that grows by age? But that being said, I would keep the savings wallet info until they're a certain age then they get them?

Yes also was where the first cannabis dispensary in Canada started to accept Bitcoin, and for their pizzeria next door. Vancouver is pretty hot for btc, but for the volume of people that live and work in Vancity it's surprising how little businesses here understand that saying no to Bitcoin is saying no to some serious business, of course pending that there is demand for their business in the first place:) and most people that don't know about it are afraid of it so it's good that some people are willing to take their time to try to educate the new hodlers, and I think that's the way the btc community should be, supportive of each other, and help each other out, it will only create value. But instead people want to argue but let's stop fuelling their fire and focus on positive advancement��⚡️

I'm just going to start selling myself for Bitcoin this ain't no BBQ!

@_date: 2017-07-18 02:55:28
Do it! Im almost considering it! People will see it so much they will keep thinking about it the more hey see it��
@_date: 2017-07-21 18:35:47
Cool! Did u find them learning more about Bitcoin or telling their friends? It's just funny cause I've talked to so many people about Bitcoin right down to how it will change the whole world, and they could care less, but something mentally switched on and made them care once I gave them some�� and started telling friends. I'm just mostly suggesting this as a way of getting people, families and co workers on board! 
I also try to inspire them to take their skills in their free time to start businesses or other ways to Accumulate their own Bitcoin. For example explaining how there are many free lance website that pay out bit coin for all kinds do jobs and tasks! I think all people that hold Bitcoin should take a look at what skills they have, training etc and apply them to free lance sites or start their own side business and accumulate them that way!
@_date: 2017-07-18 02:29:30
Never know, it was more like some education, they were all over, around banks, cross walks, ATMs good spots people would notice so I'm sure they got something decent!
I tipped $8.01 even ��

Something interesting I noticed in all this time I have been talking to my family and friends about Bitcoin. Is it tends to go right over most of their heads. But even more interesting, i found that when I GAVE my Mother a gift of $100 in Bitcoin for her birthday, that she started keeping an eye on it more and more! From the prices to where it's accepted!  I gave my father and sister each $50 at the same time (Made them each set up a secure wallet account etc) and the with the same result, a few weeks later they're all talking about the price with out me even bringing it up�� they got totally into It!  But not until I actually made them dl a wallet n send some!
Now I'm curious.. does anyone else or has anyone else done this? I'm going to expand from family and start sending friends $20 on their birthdays now. Same way make them make a wallet, download an app to watch the market and show them some sites they can use them on (gift card sites etc)
Would love to hear back from the community, thoughts etc:)

So far from what I seen, u wanna get in after the full moon dips down, then let it rise as it gets closer to full moon, and sell em off right before/at full moon at their high and then buy more when it goes down again. Playing with it anyways
