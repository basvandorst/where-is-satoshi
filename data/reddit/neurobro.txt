Wait, I thought you were talking about Bitcoin's deflationary tendency, and how it wouldn't work as a currency because nobody would buy things today if they knew they can get more tomorrow for the same price.
"Hoarding" (saving) dollars/euros/yen/whatever DOES allow you to buy faster, better computing devices in the future for the same price, almost guaranteed. So if it is very simple as you claim, nobody should be willing to use those currencies to buy computing devices today.
If you were talking about Bitcoin's current volatility, volatility doesn't stop people from buying (and selling, and buying).

I think the idea is that people who already have bitcoins could pay with them instead of going through the hassle of trading for XYZ first. And it would increase "brand" awareness.

The first part seems like a fair response to the wrinkled old "imaginary currency" dig.
If one interprets the last part as some kind of threat (oh noes! not a thread!), then maybe a line was crossed, but it's really a matter of interpretation.

They also have algorithms to *detect* bots and ignore their votes. But if you could reliably determine that your bot is being ignored, it is a signal that it's time to switch to a new proxy, etc.

Looks like the 6720g2 is actually a combination of two GPUs, the 6520G and 6650M. The two together appear to be in the ballpark of 90 watts.
That's going to produce a lot of heat in a poorly-ventilated laptop and probably shorten its lifespan, but in terms of electricity alone you should get a decent return.

That would be easily traced. If a wallet at either end can be linked to your identity at some time in the future, the whole history of activity is available. You would need to use a mixing service that splits and combines random amounts with a number of unrelated transactions, hopefully some of which *aren't* "of interest". (And hopefully the mixing service doesn't get compromised in the middle of the process, or suddenly decide to keep everyone's bitcoins.) That's the reason for the Zerocoin project, which isn't ready yet.

Inflation and deflation both have advantages and disadvantages. If your whole economy revolves around the expectation of near-perpetual inflation and everyone burying themselves in as much debt as they can bear, then deflation is bad, yes. But the constant specter of looming hyperinflation isn't doing us any favors, either. Deflation tied to economic growth is reasonably predictable, and every hoarder/saver will still have reasons to spend as prices fall, producing inflationary pressure that limits the disincentive of others to lend and invest. Probably there won't be many unemployed people with 50,000 picoBTC credit limits.

Everyone that participates in an economy is both a seller and a buyer at different points in time. People need trust when wearing either hat in a transaction. The infrastructure for that doesn't just pop up fully developed overnight.

By that I mean don't put a huge portion of your wealth into bitcoin. If you spend 10k on it tomorrow, I hope it's because you have enough savings in a more stable form that you won't lose everything if the experiment goes sour.

It is necessary to make a value proposition to established, trusted merchants who would otherwise be happy to ignore bitcoin altogether. I don't disagree that consumer protection is also needed in a full-scale economy, but things happen one step at a time. A service that makes it easy for merchants to accept bitcoin within their normal course of business is one of those steps, and it's in the right direction.

Lawyers have a lot of ways of saying the same thing.
If you actually are illegally practicing law, "[this is not legal advice, but [legal advice]]( isn't going to save you. If you're just giving a random opinion, it's redundant. So it's pointless either way. It only makes sense if you are a lawyer but don't want your words to be construed as professional advice (e.g. you'd have to do more research first, and that costs money).

Suppose in 50-100 years the world economy is based on a decentralized digital currency, whether an evolved Bitcoin or a successor. This will be where the transformation began, and it will be a big one. That's the potential. Whether it happens is another matter.

If we take one satoshi as the analogue of one cent USD, then 21 million BTC is analogous to a monetary base of $21 trillion - almost 10 times what it is today. It just means the future "dollar" would be a picoBTC (if I counted correctly). In other words, 21 million BTC is enough for all global trade.

Just a bit of what I hope is constructive criticism: Instead of linking the Bitcoin price to the dollar price, just set a fixed price of 0.25 BTC or whatever (just over half-price at the moment) and then update it periodically based on longer-term trends in the exchange rate.
That's what I plan to do when I finally come up with something worthwhile to sell. It would have a stabilizing effect if more people did this, and the fluctuations are not such a big deal unless you're immediately selling the Bitcoins at market rates.
