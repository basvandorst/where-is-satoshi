Yeah I guess I could have a paper wallet in case I lose the password or it gets corrupted or something like that, Great idea :-) 
I saw the truecrypt audit croudfunding thing a couple days a go and kicked in a couple bucks, I actually didn't know that it hadn't been audited yet. Even still though, truecrypt is by far the best option out there.

@_date: 2013-11-23 05:16:04
That's why you use the hidden thing in truecrypt where it is 2 separate places to store files, plausible deniability is brilliant

This looks very well done and trustowrthy, from the standpoint of a person who has been interested in, but never actually put any money into bitcoin. I cant put my finger on it but something about gox ant btc-e always made them seem geared towards neckbeards. I just started the transfer of funds, I'm pretty excited :-)
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:47:11
Hue hue hue you are all broke, have fun in the dumpsters everyone :-) 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:58:40
Oh, I thought you meant 57% of bitcoins currently in circulation are in the hands of .0001% of bitcoin users.

Armory won't run on arm processors, which is what you should be using if you care about security.
Actually if you compile it from source yourself you could probably get it running, nvm.
@_date: 2013-11-20 23:51:11
I run the full client, it is needed for armory

Tbh the fact that the idea is even causing a ruckus really makes me doubt bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-11-23 08:34:58
This is definitely a troll, I read it through and was really sad until I figured it out
@_date: 2013-11-21 21:22:04
Its true, Google wants control over the entire internet, bitcoin is a threat to them and Google wallet

Very well written article, I don't quite agree with the issue he raises with mining, but it was a very balanced article, once again well written.
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:47:13
To be honest I don't fully understand it.  To me it seems like btcchina moves into a legal gray area more than anything else.  I'm sure someone knowledgable in Chinese law will clear this up eventually.
@_date: 2013-11-23 09:31:18
Haha same I've been on about it in irc all day.  1 day to confirm my ID stuff, then like an hour after I made my cash deposit it was credited in my account 
@_date: 2013-12-04 20:03:09
Whatever, I still trust armory and a long ass password over this.
@_date: 2013-11-29 14:08:52
What are you on about?
Either way, bin laden was from Saudi Arabia not Iran.

In your mind saying

I think you would make an excellent case study for an introductory psychology class, maybe consider volunteering for that :)

Nono, you see living life as a functioning retard is a GOOD thing.
@_date: 2013-11-12 19:52:50
That's really smart

Holy fucking shit do you people actually believe this shit?
@_date: 2013-11-11 06:59:07
That's cool, I was going to try to figure out paper wallets and stick them in a safe, but this sounds like a much better option. I can just truecrypt + armory encrypt the wallet, put it in a safety deposit box and never have to worry about it.
Now I just have to figure out how to buy bitcoins so I can test it myself before I go big :P
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:41:35
Linux, use it

The joke
@_date: 2013-11-14 23:56:00
Could anyone tell me the advantage in doing all this vs just making an offline wallet in armory and burying a usb stick with the wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:29:30
Whitelisted internet.
Less absurd than it seems it wouldn't shock me if the an attempt to block this was at least brought forward in the next 20 years

Now if only I could memorize my private key :-P

@_date: 2013-12-06 18:37:47


You could have just said retard instead of libertarian.  We would have understood you, plus you wouldn't have had to look up how to spell libertarian.
@_date: 2013-11-29 04:24:37

Wow, this is really disrespectful, how dare you accuse us of not knowing anything.  I have almost doubled my money in the last 3 years.

People told me to use a pool, but I never thought Bitcoins would be worth anything so I never learned how :-[

Is there an option to have the codes from the cards delivered digitally, or must we deal with mailing them?

Glad I stayed up and sold early shiggy
@_date: 2013-11-12 15:10:32
I might write a little guide on how to do it yourself, but what I did was:
 download the ubuntu mini remix
Customise the iso to use a gui
Pack the debs in the iso
Rebuild the iso
This way all my usb stick has on it is the wallet file, the livecd has what it needs to run Armory and nothing else.
And yeah I know i used a bunch of wrong terminology but I'm tired 
@_date: 2013-11-19 03:52:33
Source on that?  I think it'll crash soon, but I can't believe 57% is owned by .0001% of people

@_date: 2013-11-12 02:47:47
That's makes much more sense than what I read earlier, thanks! I'll definitely use that over truecrypt.
@_date: 2013-12-02 07:46:31
Keepassx is open source, works on everything (osx, Linux, windows android), and is simple as shit to use.
Nothing comes close to it right now.
@_date: 2013-11-12 07:54:59
If you could post an update to this in the future I'd really appreciate it.
I'm in Canada too and I'd be pretty interested in how he liquidates it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 06:35:09
Ugh I had the client with the mining software built in, I never figured out how to use it so I never mined :-( 
@_date: 2013-12-07 07:49:45
Just a work of art, absolutely beautiful.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:19:28
You can't act like it is a certainty the price will rise, or even that it will not fall.
The circle jerk here is dangerous people could lose a lot of money.  I'm not saying don't invest in bitcoin (full disclosure I have around $100 usd in btc) but pretending it is a guaranteed investment is idiotic.

I fucking hate PayPal, I will never use them again regardless of if they take Bitcoins or not
@_date: 2013-11-23 06:12:32
That isn't a guarantee.  If you have a 3kB hidden truecrypt on a 32GB flash drive the odds are small that it will be overwritten, but you're right, to be safe you should still back up.
@_date: 2013-11-15 18:39:38
I don't believe it will happen soon, but this whole thing made me doubt bitcoins, I (naively) believed bitcoin was immune to this kind of central control
@_date: 2013-11-30 03:17:36
haha not worth having a Wikipedia page if he doesn't have bitcoins
@_date: 2013-12-05 15:45:09
I guess my expectations were unreasonable haha
