No, the line is blurry, and depends very much on the implementation.
CPython requires the interpreter, Jython requires Java, but you absolutely *can* compile native executables with Cython that depend on nothing more than CPython shared library (I'm sure you can link a static version of the library too).
C++ actually requires a runtime too, but it's invisible, because it's often a shared library that is shipped with the system.
Go has a runtime too, but it's statically linked with reference compilers, gccgo has a shared library dependency.

"Python" doesn't run your code. CPython does. PyPy JIT-compiles your code on the fly. Jython compiles your code to Java bytecode. Cython translates it to C code. It's just an implementation detail.

10k coins will only yield $2.3M (actually less, as the market will move down as they sell). They claim to have invested **$11,000,000**. Hence, to break even they need to sell at least $11M worth of coins. So they actually need to sell 47,619 coins. And that's with a generous assumption that they can sell all of them at $231 (if they manage to find a private buyer).
It doesn't matter what their buy price is if the market doesn't have enough liquidity to absorb at least $11M worth of coins.

I doubt that... at least with back-of-the-envelope calculations.
They claim to have invested $11M in April. I'm looking at order books in Bitcoinity, and total bids are:
1. Bitfinex: $3.87M
2. Bitstamp: $2.7M
3. Coinbase: $529k
4. OKCoin: $500k
5. BTC-e: $136k
So it takes about $8M worth of coins to wipe out the bid side in most public markets and crash the price to near-zero.
Can they cash out privately? We don't know what OTC demand there is right now, especially with the long-term downtrend, you'd think Draper and Silbert had enough from the Fed auctions.

@_date: 2015-05-09 13:18:50
To be honest, you lost me. I'm not sure we are on the same page here.


Why? At-market orders by definition don't have the price limit, it's filled at the best available market price. Imagine the top of book is a $100.00/$100.05. A retail at-market buy comes in. It would be filled at $100.05 if it hits the exchange, which is the best available offer. How does early access make you money off these (as opposed to badly priced limit orders that cross the spread)? They can't just fill at arbitrary price. Explain the mechanics of what you mean here.


Well, not if the limit order crosses the spread. E.g. the book is $100.00/$100.05, and a juicy retail buy comes in at $100.30 limit. On the exchange it'd be filled at $100.05 and up, but preferential flow would let a MM fill it at $100.30 without it going to the market.
Would this not be why you'd buy the order flow in the first place?


Are you are saying a MM who bought the flow can delay your order from going to the exchange for an arbitrary period without filling it?


I was under the impression we were talking about real exchanges, not this dodgy bitcoin exchange.


Still not following you. What do you mean by "step in front"? The only place I've seen this terminology used is to mean one MM's quote stepping in front of another's quote. I.e. if the book is $100.10/$99.95, I can step in front of these quotes with $100.05/$100.00 respectively.
It's not at all clear without examples what it means for the retail order, or how you would make money in this case.


Well, you can make the same argument about colocation and tech. Those who pay more can afford a better placement, better tech, so they see and react to the orders faster. Buying order flow is basically a roundabout way to do the same thing. Do I feel all MMs should have equal access? No. It's business, and paying for this is the cost of doing business.

Here a retail broker gives up its the orders to a specific market makers, rather than an exchange giving everybody's orders to specific traders.
If you are a retail buyer and send a $100 buy order, you don't really care who fills it, you are still getting the $100 price.

How? Can you give an example?
If $100 order is joining the bid, you can't do anything.
If they are crossing the spread, you can try to cancel your offer and put it up higher. But there are other market makers. You'd have to take out their offers up to that level, so you can immediately sell into this overpriced retail order, but that makes little sense, because retail order is more than likely a fraction of what you just cleared out to take it, why would you do it?

Difficulty in sending money back is probably the reason there is a discrepancy on the South African exchange in the first place.

Yeah, if you are willing to wait at the top of the book, you are actually collecting the spread (aka market making), if you don't want to wait, you have to cross the book and pay the spread (market taking).
And yes, trade price is a single price, because it's just the last price on either bid or offer side of the book, but it keeps flipping between sides.

It absolutely doesn't matter that the employer is paying the spread. Someone is still paying it, and it will be most likely be passed onto OP. It's even more apparent with bitwage: they just convert your USD salary on your behalf.
So the fact remains: OP will be paying it twice for nothing. There is nothing profitable about it. You are still better off simply buying after receiving your pay.
@_date: 2015-08-17 15:56:30
@_date: 2015-08-09 13:50:32


I'm absolutely not talking about the market impact. It's irrelevant.


If he's getting salary in bitcoin, he's most likely using a service like bitwage who is buying on an exchange just like everybody else. His company most certainly won't keep "bitcoin reserves" and then price his salary in USD, only a moron would do that.
Therefore he would pay the buy/sell spread once via bitwage (or whatever) on 100% of his salary once, and then once more on 90% when he sells on an exchange or LBC.
So OP would be paying for literally nothing.
@_date: 2015-08-26 01:29:22

It seems you are confused about what buy/sell spread is. The market doesn't trade on a single price, there is always a gap between buy and sell price. Buy price is always higher. For example, if the book is at $266.5/$267.5 and you buy and then sell right away, you are out of pocket $1.
It's just a fact of **all** the markets, you can't avoid it. The less liquid the market is, the larger the spread is.

They don't need deposits, they need *reserves*. Reserves are created by the central bank (ECB in this case). Broad money supply is created purely electronically against reserves (as a percentage, subject to capital requirements). Reserves are cash on hand + the balance of the commercial bank's account with central bank.
So he is correct, customer deposits are not strictly needed, but if all cash is withdrawn, the banks will dip below their reserve requirements.

I'm not in the USA, but looking online, the most expensive drink is **$4.25**. Let's take it as a generous estimate.
You need to convince **23-47 people per hour** to make said $10-$20.
That's about **1.2-2.5** minutes per person.
In 2 minutes (on average) you need to:
1. Make them listen to your sales pitch.
2. Have them get comfortable with the mobile website.
3. Have them make the purchase, and exchange cash with you.
4. Additional time marketing bitcoin when they inquire (I think you'd have about 20 seconds left by that point in the best case).
Obviously in reality it will be much less revenue and much more effort.

OpenSSL harboured a critical bug for years, Bash for decades, and yet it was used by the biggest Internet companies. Surely hackers would find bugs in it straight away, because it'd be valuable to exploit, right?
Another thing is that the code does not stay the same all the time, and does not necessarily gets better with age. In fact, often it gets worse. Regressions may be introduced at any point. And they don't even have to involve bitcoin's own code, for example, bias in the OS random number generator can significantly weaken private keys generated with it.

So the answer is "no", it doesn't make the cost disappear, it just shifts it.

I can pay with a payment cards/PayPal, etc, so all my payments are already instant. I'm not losing sleep over transfers or bank transfers not being instant.


That's pretty vague, not sure what you are implying here.
It can provide proof of existence of a piece of data at "point of time X or earlier", but that's about it. It doesn't establish authenticity, doesn't hold up in court.


The majority of modern money is electronic, it can't be counterfeited (please don't bring up sidestepping central bank monetary policy here, I'm not engaging in a political debate).
Counterfeit cash is largely inconsequential on a large scale.


So far bitcoin has a bad track record with security, which is caused by woeful state of computer security in general. It can become more secure as hardware wallets evolve, but there is nothing stopping traditional payment systems employing public key cryptography, so it's hardly an innate advantage.


Evolution marketplace, MtGox. How do you imagine it will help? You still need to see the full books to know that funds aren't being embezzled, not just the totals.
Same as with the traditional financial system.


You are right, it's not very anonymous, it's pseudonymous. But it doesn't change its main use case.
So what's left?
It doesn't really solve many mainstream consumer's problems convincingly. First world has got a developed banking system, and the "unbanked" third world has got no money, and bitcoin doesn't solve the "no money" problem.
It has potential to be a currency of choice for goods and services that banking system wants nothing to do with. That is **the killer app for bitcoin.** But, as the article says, it's not that useful for the majority of people.

She may have stayed because she still cared about the event. Why should she cancel her plans because of one creep? It was small enough to brush off, but still big enough to make her uncomfortable.


That's mostly true, but sadly it's not mutually exclusive with theredpill types who can't pick up any social cues. It's a systemic problem at tech conferences.
It just doesn't happen openly for everybody to see. If you are a guy, it doesn't happen to you, so you stay relatively blind to it. And it's not always easy to spot this happening to other people. If I saw somebody at an event half-hugging someone else, I'd assume they are good friends or a couple, and wouldn't pay close attention to it. At least not long enough to spot the problem.
When something like this happens, it's common for victims to be confused or frightened, and stay quiet, not to cause a scene, so that hides it even further.
And another thing, as you say, tech events are full of "hover arm nerd variety", so people who actually see it keep their mouths shut and walk away to avoid getting involved and bringing attention to themselves.

When a miner takes a profit by selling on the open market, they take out existing bids (market-taking). On aggregate, N coins become N + 25 coins but with the same amount of USD.
Given constant demand, the net effect is, miners take away a bit of money from each holder of existing coins. It's just a transfer of value from one entity to another. No new value is created. **This is zero-sum game.**

You still need all individual operators to adopt a system based on bitcoin. I'm just saying it's the same as adopting any other common micropayment system.
Besides, just adopting a common backbone is not useful by itself, like you said before, your last-mile payment protocol (e.g. electronic tag) needs to work across systems. Bitcoin doesn't help you here. And you still need to convince individual operators to adopt it.


You are saying they are building a system on top of bitcoin, which puts us back in the same position: you still need to sell it to individual operators. It doesn't really make much difference whether it's based on bitcoin or not.

The thing is, every implementation has to be compatible bug-to-bug with core, so it's a de-facto specification. In fact, in the past a bug indeed caused a hard fork. So it's fair to say that **core implementation ≈ bitcoin protocol**.

Wi-Fi being a poor tool for the job is the least of the worries with the bus example, as outlined in my answer above.
Instability, patchy coverage and opportunistic communication are much bigger problems.
There is also an issue of system design. You are adding extra complexity to a protocol that should remain as simple as possible, because it's frequently operating in a hostile environment/deployed on battery-powered devices. It's just adding extra moving parts that may fail and muddies the design by mixing billing logic where it doesn't belong, for no good reason.
It's far easier to have a centralised "relationship" and/or an out-of-bound system that does all the necessary accounting and settlement than having millions of separate microtransactions.
Bottom line is, "microtransactions for IoT via bitcoin" in the bus example is a solution looking for a problem. You'd need a better example to convince me that it isn't.

401k will hold a basket of securities that keep the economy working (they *are* a sample of the entire economy). Money gets cheaper, asset prices adjust to that. Rates tighten, asset prices will react accordingly. Rates go up and down, monetary base expands and shrinks, but at the end of the day your 401k still has real yield assets, not cash.
Unless you keep 100% of it in cash.

Ummm, it's a pretty tenuous example.
Latency alone kills it. As the bus passes, the device will need to be in range, be able to associate on the network, get a DHCP lease, send a transaction, wait for the bus' Wi-Fi to let you use the connection, use the Internet connection for the actual task. You have maybe 5 seconds at best. And only along the bus route. And only when the bus passes by. And you need the bus to have up-to-date state of the blockchain.
If you run, say, an electronic billboard system, you actually *want* to have a formal relationship with your wireless vendor regardless, to ensure the level of service that won't interfere with your core business, so opportunistic connection is out of the question. That's what enterprise contracts are usually for.
Passing through transactions is more friction and less reliable than a bulk contract with a wireless carrier to have a range of devices have always-on 3G (ala Kindle).
Even if you decide to ignore all limitations and go with micropayments for opportunistic connection, you don't really need blockchain for that. You can have a payment protocol based on digital signatures sent from devices (like an NFC card) and the wireless vendor verifying the signature against an account in a proprietary payment system.

That's an astonishing feat of mental gymnastics.
Buffett doesn't own a controlling stake of Goldman Sachs, so he doesn't exactly get to tell its management what to do. The management team of Goldman Sachs have minds of their own, and they can make investment decisions on their own.
Even if we close our eyes and imagine for a moment that he did, would he feel it's appropriate to micromanage all small investment decisions made by his portfolio companies? The investment is not even in bitcoin, the commodity, but a business that is very likely centred around building services and infrastructure. And it's not even $50M, the wording implies they are not alone in this investment round.
So, to summarise,
1. Buffett does not have a controlling stake in Goldman Sachs
2. Goldman is not necessarily investing full $50M into a bitcoin startup
3. The startup in question doesn't necessarily have exposure to bitcoin itself (in gold rush sell pickaxes something something)
How does this imply that Buffett lied?

Why is it ideal?
You can have a common payment protocol generating offline authorisation signatures without bitcoin. There is no material difference. It's completely orthogonal to backend settlement system. One settles against a p2p ledger, another settles against a proprietary database.


That's a lot of words that say nothing.
What do machine-to-machine communications have with human delays of "traditional systems"? And why are traditional systems ill-suited for making devices talk to each other? And why would blockchain be more suited for cross-device transactions? Are you conflating low-level networking protocols, payment protocols, housekeeping and accounting of device ownership?
It would be helpful if you give an example of what exactly you mean, otherwise it's just too vague to discuss.

That's a non-sequitur. Database != protocol. Wi-Fi is not unique in its near-universal support. We *do* have standard common protocols and platforms (HTTP, JSON). New platforms, protocols, and standards appear all the time. Why do you need to involve bitcoin specifically when you can pick a tool better suited for the job?


Why does any of it have to involve bitcoin blockchain? Why trying to insert slow and expensive overly replicated immutable database for something that needs to track fast changing data? Why?
You stated all these questions without saying what problem it's solving. I still say it's all a bunch of hand-waving, and a solution looking for a problem, just like another example in the other thread I answered.
