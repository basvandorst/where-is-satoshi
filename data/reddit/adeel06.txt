Oil and Gas allows for the diversification of funds that have been generated through mining, considering the whole point of Bitcoin+Alt-Coins was to change the concentration of money from the global elites .00000001% back into the hands of the free-thinking world. 
Next off, considering the banking industry is so against Bitcoin/Alt-Coins and they should be, we have developed a team comparable to that of a team on Wall Street. 
However still, I cannot speak of the last product as it has not been finalized. The value of these coins will continue to grow once we are utilizing them to help grow the ecosystem and there are many people that are working diligently to help create this.

Mark better hide his face if he knows what's good for him. You don't lose 700,000 Bitcoin without knowing it. All you people flaming us for having our coins there, I tried withdrawing multiple times and could not. So if you don't have anything nice to say keep it to yourselves, and be thankful you aren't in our position.

Why didn't I get one or how did you guys go about obtaining one?
@_date: 2014-01-07 17:26:35
Amazon and ebay guy? Huh? I think you have me confused with someone else sir.

The problem isn't only with the fact that mtgox caused the price to crash on their own exchange, but that they have caused the price to decrease across other exchanges as well with this assinine move. It's very sad but shows that bitcoin is still in its' infancy because if any large company fails, it causes the collapse of the value of our coin. I truly hate you mtgox, and not only because you stole my coins and I was dumb enough to leave them on there while you solved your "technical issues with withdrawals of btc".

Are there really that many trolls on this subreddit that aren't interested in the growth of bitcoin at all?
@_date: 2014-02-25 07:16:52
50 :/. Sad day for bitcoin. While at the same time a day that will be historic for our growth and ability to adapt to whatever comes our way. Stay strong guys. I know this can be tough for many of us.

Completely agree. The website is completely ready but we don't want to go "live" prior to the response from the United States Securities and Exchange Commission, so sadly, we wait.

I wish we could just legitimatize the currency and quit having all of these black market websites popping up all the time just to get under the eyes of the government. As if their reach isn't large enough. :|

Along with that, we have a 30% reinvestment program that also pays for larger and larger bitcoin miners with bigger contracts, just our cooling, security, hosting etc is far better than KnC miners' hosting and than CloudHashing Contracts. I promise you, InfiniteHash will be the next huge company in bitcoin. We have a bunch of novel ideas that we will be finding patents for as well. 
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:46:31
This is true, but I think that some people can't afford the really high-end miners like the 2 terahash systems at $13,999 or the 500 gh/s system from butterfly labs at $24,999
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:02:58
Also, I'm not entirely sure about the downvotes. 
Our 50 GH/s system is only $1699
100 GH/s system is only $3199
We offer prices from 25-40% cheaper than our competitors along with numerous other benefits such as contests and bonuses that will be available once the website is up!
I would like to thank everyone who took the time to even read this, and if you downvoted it and it isn't your thing, please let us know what we can do to improve it! Thank you so much, with the utmost consideration,
Adam Anwar
CEO Infinite Companies LLC

I also just re-read this initial post and I am very sorry to everyone who thought our prices were as they were listed above. Those were our initial prices back in June, for completely different miners (avalon based). I thought I had changed the pricing to reflect currents prices, based on newer, cost-efficient technology for that I apologize.
@_date: 2013-11-15 01:55:54
Bump? We have absolutely no one interested in this? As opposed to Avalons 10 BTC reward for creating a PCB for their generation 2 chips, our reward in BTC would be larger, there are also company stock, and other options available.

Yes but farms also help the Bitcoin network grow and get into the hands of a decentralized community, which is what we really want in the first place. Sadly, in terms of economics, the ROI, isn't good ATM but Bitcoin is a Currnecy that has gained in value over the last ~4 years steadily and as such, the bitcoins mined today, would be extremely profitable tomorrow. So to speak.

Hey guys. Im the actual owner of the company. We are only offering a few more shares to the general public, but after that the rest of the systems are for my other venture which is a website that already has tons of sales before its even live. Anyway, as to answer your question, the systems will keep mining until no longer profitable but we are at the front of KNCminers list. If youre interested email me at adeel06 but be warned, I'm only selling a few more shares. The reason I'm hooking up the bitcoin community with this deal is that I would appreciate if all my shareholders helped spread the word about my new website which will be up shortly and kick cloudh*shing.com's butt. The sites name will be  when it is up. Our pricing beats theirs, hell our everything beats theirs. Just wait until the site is live. We also have first dibs on KnCminers 2nd release which will be 20nm and a terahash plus each system.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:25:07
Haha, I highly doubt that considering how cheap I am offering this to everyone.
@_date: 2013-10-06 22:51:36
Can you guys please explain to me why we are being downvoted, instead of just down voting? So that we may learn what we can do to better serve our customers. Thank you! :)
@_date: 2013-10-07 12:42:45
Also our prices are 30% less than Cloudhashing yet they have 14,000 sales sir.
@_date: 2013-09-04 20:44:55
Not sure why people are downvoting this. The guy just wanted to know about what people know in regards to Bitcoin. A general discussion would've been a lot nicer, some redditors are just rude. I know what Bitcoin is an also about how to mine. I first ordered from butterflylabs but those guys didn't ship for over a year and used customers money to continue their research and development and stuff like that.

Yifu (I can't call him mister) has a terrible sense of business, economics, management and anything related to the aforementioned subjects. This isn't a bad thing however, one less BFL-esq competitor for companies that are actually honest and working hard to provide their customers with mining solutions that are worth it. The names KnCminer, Bitmine.ch, InfiniteHash and Cointerra come to mind. Honestly most engineers, or groups of engineers have a very poor business sense. I believe we may have lucked out to have MBA's, Masters in Economics, along with accountants and lawyers on our team as it is always best to utilize a variety of skills to provide your customers with the best experience possible. I really can't wait to release our new products! :D!

Thank for you actually caring about the concerns of you constitutants Senator Moran. I know my Senator Coburn, did not care the slightest bit about the negative impact overregulaton of the financial markets has on the growth of America's Economy in the 21st Century apparatus.

I think that this actually is kind of funny. First off, just so the people reading this know, I was going to get an eMBA for “Investment Banking”. The fact that this executive doesn’t want to use his brain, and try to think outside of the box to think of ways that he could implement Bitcoin into his current companies’ implementations is just laughable. Honestly, these are the people that are running todays’ businesses in America and then we wonder why we are falling behind the rest of the world. I’m just going to continue laughing, because there is nothing else we really can do that the Bitcoin revolution already isn’t doing for us.
It just scares these institutions because for once, instead of us being forced to assimilate or have less access to consumer solutions, this time it is the opposite. The banks, credit card companies, etc all have to either assimilate or get left behind for others to create in their place. And create they will. :)

I agree with your prediction and do believe difficulty plays the largest role in this. I predicted the price to be $180+ by the time new ASIC systems came out, and they just came out this month so, in a few years the price will be very high. The United States is the only extremely important country that hasn't joined in. Hopefully they will be like Canada and not make it legal tender, but make it so exchanges can set up there etc. If the US doesn't switch over we will be behind the rest of the world with a digital currency that is clearly taking over.
@_date: 2013-09-04 18:26:01
Hey guys, check out  . Where I posted proof of our early order dates. These are just some of the systems, since I ordered some on another account, but still, there you have it! :)
@_date: 2013-10-24 11:55:07
We do not have any delay in mining time, we are already mining. We are currently mining utilizing KnCminers, but also have had previous old gen hardware that cost way too much electricity at the current difficulty and has been turned off. The reinvestment is only for the contracts which offer it, however, unlike cloudhashing, we speak only about actually system upgrades, not infrastructure upgrades when we are talking about reinvestment. We do have pictures up, but only of the initial build process and how we decided to cool our miners. I will send you a link so you can see how we came about starting this all.
I tried to answer every question to the best of my abiity however if you have any others, feel free to ask and I will try to reply again as well as I can. 
Currently, we are awaiting a reply from the SEC because this is not a Dollar based investment, but a Bitcoin based investment and want to make sure that the United States does not declare this as illegal at a later date and we get shafted retroactively.
