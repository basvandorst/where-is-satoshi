Bitcoin Teller Machine (ATM for bitcoins...)

Was he talking about making a single transaction?  Creating a Bitcoin account and using it is way faster than creating a bank account and using it.  Having more nodes on the network is cheaper and faster than having a bank increase its power (security/speed/etc.)  Even making a single offshore and major transaction is faster and simpler with Bitcoin than banks.  Everything being relative, what does he mean by "faster"?

Google should be a Bitcoin full node.  :-)

15 seconds between the two blocks. When second block was prepared, there was no transaction to process. That's why. That happens.
@_date: 2014-05-28 16:11:46
I've been running a few full nodes for quite some time; I was thinking if Google could provide information directly instead of redirecting to some other site (ie blockchain.info), that would be nice. Google contributing to the Bitcoin network... MMmm...

No prescription required?  Seems legit.
@_date: 2015-01-18 17:19:22
I understand.  Let's hope there will be an overall agreement, or the bitcoin ecosystem will commit suicide.  :-/
@_date: 2015-01-18 07:17:32
Don't worry, it won't affect you as a bitcoin wallet user.
@_date: 2015-01-13 01:12:47
Best luck Francis!

If you don't run a full node, you will use the one(s) used by your wallet application.  Those full node operators will agree to use the new version of the protocol (new fork, new blockchain) because it will be good to do so.  Major providers will upgrade, making most people automatically and transparently use the new chain and the old chain will die.  There will (hopefully) be a consensus for using the upgraded version of the core.  Your "old bitcoins" will still be spendable in the new chain, as well as your "new ones".
@_date: 2015-01-18 14:23:16
You're assuming a worst-case scenario will happen, but it certainly won't: the fork will be programmed a long time in advance, and full node operators will want (and will have time) to upgrade because the changes causing the fork will be a good thing for the protocol.  I'm assuming an average-best-case scenario.  :)

What miners hosting company do you use in Mtl? I was looking for one around but they're made for low-power gear, it's very expensive for several kW cabinets...
@_date: 2016-06-02 16:12:57
I think there's one at the Bitcoin Embassy in Montreal.  ?
@_date: 2016-06-14 02:10:53
But the difficulty trippled since Nov.  Price doubling cancelled.

Just turn on your miners to make it happen on Saturday night!  ;-)

Great news!  Francis is one of the most articulated Bitcoin evangelist up here in Quebec, in french as well as in english!

Nice ECDSA curve :-)
@_date: 2015-08-27 22:50:05
Nice, thanks for the info.  I guess it could be ok to ask miners what they would like to see implemented as a solution.  What I understand right now is that the bip101 port is using a bip101 instance and the regular port a Core instance.  But the port could trigger different scriptsig only, using any existing implementation, it doesn't matter as long as we get the miners votes.
@_date: 2015-08-27 16:44:02
It would be interesting that pools offer different connection strings (ie different ports) for each option, so that the real miners (and not the pool operator) are voting by connecting to the port corresponding to their preference.  The pool would construct coinbase scriptsig depending on the connection used by the miner who hit the block.  I don't know if it is possible though.
@_date: 2015-08-20 17:46:28
Nice!  Francis and Mathieu do a good job at the Embassy.
@_date: 2017-04-25 16:14:49
Haha, great review!
@_date: 2015-07-22 14:37:15
I'd say "Why don't we use bitcoins?" or "Why don't we use Bitcoin?"
Notice the added "s" in the first sentence.

Thanks!  Question: Changing the version bits seems to have the same effect as changing the nonce, but in chunk 1.  So the traditional way of mining, by changing the nonce, is a kind of by-design boost having to only work on chunk 2 until using the extranonce?... does it cost more energy changing the nonce than changing the version bits?
Edit: I realize I'm talking about the overt boost... which is not the problem.  :)

What MC/Visa cards accept BTC?
@_date: 2015-04-20 20:28:34
I wonder how advcash can provide prepaid MC cards from btc when Neteller had to stop.  I didn't know about advcash, thanks for pointing out.
@_date: 2015-09-05 13:50:10
It depends on the language, on the country.  Here in Quebec it is 20$.

Why oh why lowercase Y oh why?
@_date: 2016-05-25 17:19:36
Yeah, there's something like 2000 "declared" billionaires in the world (and probably several underground sheikhs or whatever).  Several could play a game and buy like 1M btc at up to $1,000 (around 1G$ total which is less than 1% of the Walton family) and have great drive on market.  Why not buy more, at higher prices, and owning most bitcoins just for fun?  Very rich people like to play excentric games.  The solution: having the value of btc at a very high price (1M$?), total market cap being too high to control.  That should happen eventually (and we'll be riiiiiich MOUAHAHAH!)
@_date: 2015-02-19 16:46:08
LOL: "Given the moderate time frame over which this change is to be implemented, we expect all miners to choose to screw themselves and deploy this change before 2214."

ref.  I'd say "people running full nodes" instead of "miners".  Most miners mine in pools and they don't actually run full nodes, the pool operators do.  If pool operators and major lite wallet providers join the new chain, consensus should be achieved.
