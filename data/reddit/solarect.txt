What if an actual celebrity wants to use their own name?
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:39:30
Hmm. No idea why it's gonna take 6 days then.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:41:06
Never thought I'd see a GoT post here. I'm not disappointed.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:29:27
I can't wait for LN

Rule of thumb, only spend what you can afford to lose.

If it drops I'm pouring the rest of my paycheck into it
@_date: 2017-08-01 10:05:12
The one chain to rule them all!

My parents gave me $1100 when I graduated high School in 2011. I didn't know about Bitcoin back then, so I bought a Mac

I sold $20 worth of btc today through coinbase and was told it would hit my bank account in 6 days. You sure ACH isn't faster?
@_date: 2017-07-22 04:55:34
I see it more in the comments than posts themselves
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:08:02
Fuck that I'm riding the waves
@_date: 2017-07-26 04:10:57
That might make it worth more than it otherwise would be.
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:15:02
I had a feeling it was you
@_date: 2017-07-27 04:36:39
I'm intrigued
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:40:56
What are factoids and why are you giving your seed away?
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:45:28
Even if it does subvert bitcoins market initially, wouldn't Bitcoin bounce back harder?
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:19:17
I don't know why people see dips like that and assume the world is burning down and they need to sell sell sell.
History has shown us to HODL and even stock up more during the low points.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:07:33
This guy hodls
@_date: 2017-07-27 17:58:01
Ahh yeah that seems very sketchy. I welcome the apprehension, I don't wanna get screwed over.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:05:52
You'd lose access to your BCC as coinbase only wants to support btc and not it's forks
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:20:53
I have faith in BTC
@_date: 2017-07-27 15:28:18


If only I were in London... This would be a great gig
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:06:43
It's at 2810 now
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:35:33
I'm pretty new to the crypto world. What alt coins should I keep an eye on/invest in?
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:27:12
Because time spent on Reddit = expertise
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:23:35
No, you did not. I like WaPo
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:44:59
The telling sign being software bought on Alpha Bay that actually works?
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:21:12
I'm surprised we haven't repurposed the cash me outside meme yet
@_date: 2017-07-28 02:59:35
Good observation, I actually meant the Bitcoin merchants link that said "better than provably fair"
@_date: 2017-07-23 00:23:58
I feel like your name isn't accurate... You're not secretly a pirate
@_date: 2017-07-24 09:33:24
It's fine using them to buy Bitcoin, but transfer them to a wallet you control immediately
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:20:11
I'm not sure what to do with the seed though?
@_date: 2017-07-25 04:42:32
Thanks for the link, I'm checking it out
@_date: 2017-07-24 10:20:12
I hate how this article portrays Bitcoin


@_date: 2017-07-27 17:47:33
I know that as a general rule of thumb, but it's a Bitcoin lottery site
