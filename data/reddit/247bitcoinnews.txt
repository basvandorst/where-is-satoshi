My definition of a bitcoin dummy is anyone that realizes satoshi nakamoto is CENTRAL ITELLIGENCE (edited AND KEEPS IT) so bitcoin is nothing but CIA COIN
That being said, I hold no btc now, I was all dumped as soon as that TRUTH was given to me.
Now some dummies may soon enjoy another wild growth/value bubble, so what, in the end bitcoin is known as cia coin and it has NO VALUE.
So dummy enjoy the ride, the fall will be quick and brutal DUMMY

So much good merchant news for btc, that it should be on the rise soon, IMO.
Dell Computer taking it
CheapAir.com says 1.5M in BTC sales
Overstock taking it
Expedia taking it
Apple approving blockchains wallet app
It's like the energizer bunny, it keeps going and going...

Money has value
Currency is money
Currency has the TRUST of those that use it as trade
Satoshi Nakamoto means CENTRAL INTELLIGENCE in Japanese
Now that that KNOWLEDGE is in the world, people will now refer to bitcoin as CIA COIN
As such, bitcoin is now worthless since the world will not trust a CIA coin project
Bitcoin is not money
Bitcoiin is not a currency
Bitcoin has zero real value as the world learns it was based upon a LIE
TRUTH is what destroys all lies and bitcoin emanated from a major LIE

btc as all crypto uses seed-keys
snowdens docs revealed how the nsa/cia has back doored seed-keys

Lawyers understand bitcoin is a new currency and I've seen others lawyers accepting it too. GOOD NEWS

No news letter, 247 bitcoin news was going to be a btc news portal, but it's been canceled. BTC is a fraud so there will be nothing to report once it's bubble pops and it's worthless.
A real currency must have TRUST, so unless the world wants a thing named CIA COIN, btc has zero trust and it will crash and burn.
So now news letter, nothing to report, bitcoin is CIA coin.
Just spreading the news.

For btc to move into a larger percentage of acceptance to go from .01% of gwp 8 Bil Mkt Cap to 10% of gwp or 8 Trillion mkt cap you will need huge corporate support in the core being stable and with so few now in charge of the core and known core issues like 51% issues, some type of overseeing is inevitable and I'd rather see public funding by corporations than government funding.
Bit companies will benefit most from growth of btc, governments will suffer since fiat currencies will become less relevant in the GWP.
Businesses just want their share of gwp, governments want control of gwp through fiat currencies so gov overseeing is not what takes btc to 10% or more of the gwp, it has to be public corporate trust funding.

Haven't you heard NIST and ENISA issue the seed keys and they're all coming from ENNISA a super computer algorithm for primes so all the seed-keys are back doored.
Try to create a huge seed key without ENNISA 
Crypto is all back door now, ENNISA released in 1995
It is how NSA and ENISA now walk through all secrets
