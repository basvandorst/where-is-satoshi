You have to take into account that there are differences in people's definitions of inflation and deflation. To an Austrian, for example, inflation is the expansion of the monetary unit _per se_, and deflation is the reduction. But the typical, mainstream definition of inflation is a general rise in prices; deflation a typical fall.
This is why the typical mainstream understanding of bitcoin is that it is deflationary - it isn't that people think a huge % of btc will be lost or destroyed over time; it's that, given its finite supply, prices of goods and services quoted in btc will tend to fall. This is "deflationary".

That is silly. People valued things in gold and silver before the era of fiat currencies. Why would there need to be a state for somebody to know that, say, a house would be worth 10 btc?

Apologies. No disrespect. My point is simply that value is subjective and does not rely upon the existence of a state or a state currency. 
Back to the original point, though, you pointed out that goods are not (cannot be?) priced in bitcoin. While that is currently the case, it won't always be. Eventually, the market will develop a consensus re: bitcoin's value in relation to other goods and services. This will happen whether or not fiat currencies are around.
