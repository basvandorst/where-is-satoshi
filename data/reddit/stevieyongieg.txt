Just a matter of time. BTC bulls let's show the crypto world who is the king now !

I expect BTC dominance to stay around 50% for the next few months. BTC is king in this current bear market.

I will never ever touch BCH

BTC 6,000 USD support line is holding very strong. BTC "shorts" is very high. We could see liquidation of BTC "shorts" soon (hopefully). Things looking positive now. I am bullish.

When institutional investors enter crypto market, diversification is more important than ever due to its high volatility. Bitcoin is no doubt “the safest bet” in their cryptocurrency portfolio. I think Bitcoin will make up a big portion of their institutional portfolio and hence a huge boost in price and confidence when institutional investors start investing in crypto, especially in the initial phase.

Not a magic formula, but I think it could be one of the signals for forecasting market cycles, just like the stock market or business cycles.
* In absolute dollars, this is the largest drawdown in Bitcoin history.
* The current price rut also happens to be the slowest sell-off we have ever faced.
* Bitcoin took on average **1.5x more days** to recover to the previous highs than the NASDAQ Composite did during the tech boom.
* Based on the “Recovery to Trough Ratio” of **1.69** and **111 days peak to trough** for the current drawdown, it may take another **188 days** from the low (not until mid-October 2018) before we might near the **$20K** level again.
* Bitcoin drawdowns are sharper and faster than drawdowns during the NASDAQ tech bubble, but also take a shorter time before we reach a new peak
 
  
What do you think of these numbers ?

My prediction is that the BTC dominance will stay above 50% for the next few months. BTC is the king in the current market condition.

BTC will be the king in the future. I have faith.

Oh my goodness so the venezuelan paper money is literally worthless now huh. Very unfortunate for those who live in an authoritarian country. I hope they convert all their currencies to BTC. It is the only hope for them now.

Correct. Just keep accumulating at these prices until we can't afford to accumulate!

In terms of dollar value, banks are much more corrupt than privacy coins. These white collar criminal should go to jail.
