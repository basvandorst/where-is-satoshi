@_date: 2014-03-20 21:16:15

First transactions on coinbase always take days to complete until you've got to a certain level for instant buy.
Before you purchased your BTC it should have let you know how long until received.

What's your question?

 As bitcoin being your big brother, please learn from our triumphs and failures.  Be stronger

Quick Bitinstant, put all funds into doge!  They'll never think with all the happiness and fluffy dogs that your laundering money

This OP.
No return or exchanges and give the customer a % off the transaction for bitcoin use.  
With no returns or exchanges, it is finding the balance between what % off the purchase price consumers will see as a benefit.  
From a retail perspective, you're saving from credit card charges, same way as your in house credit cards and saving R/E erosion whether that's from the resale price dropping or the vendor not crediting back.

"Mr. Worldmotor, what you've just said is one of the most insanely idiotic things I have ever heard. At no point in your rambling, incoherent response were you even close to anything that could be considered a rational thought. Everyone in this room is now dumber for having listened to it. I award you minimal doge, and may God have mercy on your soul."

An "organization" has lied continuously about partners, companies about to accept their coin, and covered up/controlled things users have said on their forums, yet here you are questioning why people are not buying in to another lie?
