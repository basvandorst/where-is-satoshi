His original post says not any coin can scale on chain...that's untrue.   Don't be intellectually dishonest.   I don't care about this segwit argument one way or the other.    In fact, truth be told, I don't own any crypto.  I just find the technology interesting.
If you can find holes in this solution, I welcome you to do it.  Until then, looks like the first coin to implement it will be able to scale well beyond anything this planet can throw at it--on-chain.

This IS new.  I agree that it is untested but it is definitely new.

Actually on-chain scaling has been solved. It's an elegant, simple, sharding solution.

Yes...a concept.  I'm not aware of any testnets. I think it's a brand new idea.   I'd say the risks would be in the balancing upon a split but I don't know.  
It looks like an incredible idea to me though.

You didn't read the link I see.  This solution could literally have a 20KB block size. Notice I said  20KB and not 20MB.  
You could run this on much lower hardware than Raspberry Pis.  This solution is the ultimate anti-centralization idea.  
Of course now, given your absolute dedication to decentralization, I'd imagine you'd really want to investigate it.

You'd have to actually give reasons.  This is a brand new, novel, simple idea that was just put forward.
