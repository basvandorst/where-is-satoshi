Actually, I agree with this.  Most banks operate with very small fractional reserves.  If they properly incentivize capital to stay on the exchange, they could pull it off.  Many people think btc-e and some Chinese exchanges already run at fractional reserves.
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:29:37
Your argument would have validity if they were loaning out everyone's BTC, but even in this case a bank would only need a fractional reserve.

@_date: 2017-03-13 19:36:04
I kept some, but I sold the vast majority.  It was such a huge gain so quickly, and I wanted to do the conservative thing.  Had I kept them, I would no longer need to work.  When I look back at it, I kick myself because I knew that if Bitcoin was really going to work, the price needed to be much, much higher.  However, at the time the legality was much more gray, so I used that as an excuse.  Now that Bitcoin is here to stay, I have a stash that I will never sell.  I've seen every type of FUD out there, and bitcoin keeps chugging away.

Go to a meetup near you and talk to folks.  One thing is irrefutable though-- two distinct groups have concentrations of power; the miners and the core devs.  Power groups are great a creating a narrative and eventually ideologies are born and people follow.  If Bitcoin can prove it can form consensus by bypassing these groups, it will become immensely more valuable.

Core is talking about changing POW, which is way crazier than a 2mb HF.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:48:27
No reasonable person wants to put visa level transactions on a decentralized blockchain-- second layer solutions are great for that.  However, if we can't keep on-chain transactions under a $1, another blockchain will.  Everyone should be able to transact on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:02:12
Bitcoin is completely crippled with high fees if you haven't noticed. BTC will only be gold with utility.  Turning it into a settlement layer where transactions cost $100 will make another crypto be gold. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:42:47
I agree, but I think that is a battle that will need to be won later.  I expect it will look like some type of POS.  Changing the POW won't change anything.  BTW-- look how hard it is to create competition in client implementation.  Mining isn't the only centralized power group. Governance is a big issue.
@_date: 2017-08-25 17:03:56
Many people (including me) just want fees to come down asap and are having difficulty accepting that a 2mb block size bump would really create any measurable centralization.  Please core, just deliver us a safe 2mb HF asap.

This is the last and final excuse for core not to support a 2MB HF.
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:06:27
I completely disagree. It's just that there are very loud people in this echo chamber.  Go to a meetup and talk to people.  I have not met a single (out of hundreds) person that doesn't want bigger blocks and cheaper fees. I'm not saying the blockchain needs to store your coffee purchase, but we should be able to get onchain fees down to the point where everyone can afford to use it.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:53:58
Do the math, it will need to be much higher.  It's the only reason I think we should increase the blocksize. I agree 99.9% of transactions should be in LN type solutions in the distant future.
@_date: 2017-08-18 05:38:44
There will always be a need for merchant processors for integration.  LN will help them, and they will probably run their own.
@_date: 2017-08-19 04:17:19
I agree, much of this is FUD.  I have heard it and even said it (lately) myself.  I felt the same way you did.  Slowly over time I saw the reasons change as to why a 2MB HF was bad.  After full blocks and high fees kicked in I just couldn't take the uncompromising stagnation. I would still like to see core do an about face and support a 2x implementation, but I suspect the best I can hope for is that many of the non-political devs will contribute to BTC1 once it becomes the default client.
@_date: 2017-08-28 05:10:47
But let assume they are completely wrong.  Running a node can always be incentivized, hardware tech/bandwidth improves, sharding like bittorrent can help.  In all cases, the true cost of running a node will never be the hardware and bandwidth, it will be the expertise.  I'm probably not going to convince you no matter what I say.

The NY meeting was a result of the impeding UASF threat.  It's somewhat ironic that in the end BTC1 will be the most popular client as a result.  Had core just done the 2MB upgrade years ago none of this would have happened, all these shitcoins wouldn't be so valuable, and BTC would be at $10k+.
@_date: 2017-08-22 21:01:58
The flip side of this argument is that if we can only perform 2000 on-chain transactions every 10 minutes, mining power will decrease with the block reward making us susceptible to a state sponsored 51% attack.

You are correct, miners do not unilaterally control everything.  Exchanges, merchant processors, and wallets will need to weigh in.   If the largest exchanges say Bitcoin is now upgrading to 2mb, it will be done. Some smaller exchanges my rebel, but once they complete, the immediate lower fees will win in the marketplace.  
@_date: 2017-08-17 17:29:29
Does 2mb really cause that much centralization?  There is way more centralization in mining in general.

Gosh, now imagine if we... here it comes: DOUBLED THE BLOCK SIZE!
@_date: 2017-08-26 04:29:33
My mind is genuinely boggled by your logic as well friend.  Wider adoption is what we want, and the larger the block size, the harder it is to spam.  Additionally, the wider adoption, the more people that will want to run a node thereby creating more decentralization (even at a slightly higher cost of doing so).  I see the enemy as friction and the cost of making transactions.  Timing is critical here. The world is ready for this, and we can't even send a transaction without paying $5.  BTW-- dash is working on a roadmap for 400+ mb blocks.  
@_date: 2017-08-29 20:21:57
GOT joke?
@_date: 2017-08-28 04:39:28
Risks are minimal, there have been studies.  Google it.   Also, if node count really became an issue, just incentivize them like dash.  BTW, dash won't reduce it's master node requirement (1000 dash) because they would have too many nodes.  Not trying to pump dash, but Bitcoin should learn from the alts and incorporate what works. 


I'm all for layer two solutions including LN, but they are too far off.  Many of us have been championing Bitcoin for years only to make excuses why it doesn't work now that everyone is finally listening.  It is heartbreaking.  Centralization from a 2mb bump is a complete non-issue.  The bigger threat is lack of adoption.  We need to keep it close to free for as long as possible until the layer two solutions are really ready.

I would like to retort--
It is two years in the making; two years of stalling and endless scare tactics of how a HF will destroy Bitcoin and how a 2 mb increase will create centralization.  As far as the corporate takeover rhetoric (or back room deal as some love to call it), you could easily argue that already happened when core booted Gavin and Blockstreem emerged-- a single corporate entity to guide the development of Bitcoin.  Open your eyes!  The entire idea of the block reward is to keep fees low or free until real adoption takes hold.  BS has crippled Bitcoin to create a problem that should not exist at this point.  2x is the industry and stake holders at large doing something about it.  Like it or not, 2x will pass and most of the core devs will contribute to BTC1 instead.  A year from now, Bitcoin will be even stronger.
@_date: 2017-09-27 01:48:32

Coinbase is not reckless, and they have done more for the growth of Bitcoin than probably any other company.  Let's try to be reasonable. Their top priority is to get Bitcoin to scale and their (or any processor) biggest challenge is transaction fees. They saw high fees coming years ago, and have been doing every thing they can accommodate scaling. Remember, had even modest block size increases been worked into the road map all of this would not be happening.

@_date: 2017-05-27 22:20:53
Let me clarify-- the last thing they want to do is limit block size to one meg.  People will only pay so much for a transaction.  Even with segwit, at 2000 transactions per meg, how much can they make?  Of course, I believe there should be a fee market, it just need to be much larger.
@_date: 2017-05-27 21:11:19


Agreed, but how much will people actually spend for Bitcoin to be competitive and still be decentralized in nature.  There are roughly 2000 transactions per meg, so do the math.  It is MUCH higher than what Segwit alone will give us.  Segwit is great, and we need it, but we also need real on-chain scaling on the roadmap.  
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:17:20
Can you blame them?  They've seen this problem for years, and here is litecoin- an established slightly better Bitcoin clone just sitting around.  If I were Coinbase, I would put everything I had behind Litecoin.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:23:56
They will also need bigger blocks as the block reward dwindles.  Remember, we will halve twice in the next 7 years.  There is simply no way they can survive off the block size from segwit alone.  i.e. don't make miners out to be the enemies of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin was designed for them to be economically motivated.  
@_date: 2017-05-27 20:33:03
OP is completely wrong. Sure, segwit will increase on-chain transactions, but not by enough.  **Miners are blocking segwit because they feel there won't be enough on-chain scaling once segwit is passed.**  Remember, we will halve twice in the next 7 years. If segwit passes, lightning and second layer solutions will take pressure off on-chain scaling.  They have hundreds of millions in investments, the last thing they want to do is limit block size. This is also how litecoin got segwit passed-- by guaranteeing future on-chain scaling.  **The way forward is to guarantee them on-chain scaling, that means no UASF**.
@_date: 2017-05-29 23:06:55

@_date: 2017-05-28 00:14:08
The question is rhetorical.  With segwit we are still under 5k transactions per block.  So here is a real question-- how can we secure the blockchain when the block reward runs out, and miners only have 5k transactions (assuming segwit)?  Will we charge $100 per transaction?
@_date: 2017-07-17 17:20:49
This types of opinion posts just divide the community.  It doesn't mention *why* miners want bigger blocks.  HINT:  Miners need bigger blocks to make more money as the block reward dwindles.  Sure, SEGWIT gives a blocksize bump, but it reduces the need for future on-chain scaling.  Remember, 1MB gives ~2k transactions. If we want to keep enjoying the security we have now, we'll need bigger blocks.  
@_date: 2017-05-04 16:17:10
On the flip side, him and other miners say they are worried about long-term on-chain scaling in addition to segwit.  Let's be fair.

No exchange is calling the new alt Bitcoin and the biggest processor isn't supporting it in any way.  If it catches on, great.  You have the coins and it means they have a better product.  I call it a feature.

The average person isn't going to even know about Bitcoin cash or Bitcoin dark.  All they know when they buy something from me on my website is to use Bitcoin. Now, if BCC becomes worth half of BTC for a period of time, then you are correct.  But, this is the cost of decentralization.

Good. Now just average in over a few months.  After you have some solid gains (next year), you can play the timing game (sell some, hoping to buy it back cheaper).

They are called replay attacks.  You can lose coins on the other chain if you don't know what you are doing.  It is also believe there are unknown attack vectors on contracts, especially when they call other contracts. [Here's a post to start](  Dig around in and you will see one of the devs admit they did not do it because they didn't have time and didn't think there would be a surviving fork.  ETH is pretty much broken.

Not arguing against segwit, and centralization is a valid argument, just not a 2MB.  My point is that the argument should be about what you pointed out, not that any one side is trying to destroy or take over Bitcoin.  There needs to be a scaling plan that allows for decentralization and also allows miners to make money.

In case everyone is not aware... this is not just a problem of one chain surviving and the fork gaining momentum (630 GH/s vs 3576 GH/s).  ETH devs did not properly sever the chains and now both chains are subject to replay attacks.  One chain must fork again to fix it.  ETC has said they will not, so that means coinbase is pushing a coin they know must fork-- again (or be abandoned).

There is no they, only you.

I remember when core said they didn't want to increase the blocksize because it would hurt miners in China.

We should have listed to Gavin.

As long as there is replay protection, let them do what they want.

I remember when core devs didn't want to increase blocksize because they claimed it would hurt miners in China.  It's unbelievable how recent history gets distorted... or at least under represented on this sub.

non coder question: I thought segwit2x code would replace core. Is that not the case here?
@_date: 2017-06-17 17:49:22
So what would be your end goal?  No evil miners?
@_date: 2017-06-10 21:22:43
They are blocking offchain capacity upgrades so they can get future on-chain capacity upgrades. Since devs ultimately have more power than the miners, a deal should have been met at least a year ago.

No problems. I withdrew $7k today and it was immediate.

On the other hand, larger blocks mean cheaper transactions for all, and off-chain transactions require the permission of a third party.  A balance needs to be met, and it is requires scaling beyond segwit.

coinomi handles multiple cryptos and has good paper wallet features.

Maybe now, but 7 years down the road after two halvings they will make more money with bigger blocks.  They are simply thinking ahead and trying to make the most money.  This is exactly how Bitcoin was designed.
