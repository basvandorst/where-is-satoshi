Look at the governmental track record around the world for "defeating" distributed technology and tell me this is in any danger. Remember when they defeated Pirate Bay? Which is totally not running right now as I type this...
Even if Bitcoin is "killed" somehow, well its open source. There is Litecoin, Dash, Potcoin, whatever, any number of other protocols. Kill one and two more rise, a true financial hydra if there ever was one. 
Short of destroying the entire Internet, they will never stop these movements. Even if the g-men did lock down, other distributed tech would spring up to fight it. 
The fun part about open source tech is if I don't agree, I can make my own competing version. People can choose to follow that one or not. If the Bitcoin devs get too authoritative, too entrenched, etc, I can choose to support another protocol then. Its not locked in stone, unlike traditional banking where it is their way or fuck you. 
Occupy Wallstreet was not a digital transaction layer for the Internet, it was a group of mis-guided protesters who got defeated by their own disorganization, and weather. This is a shit comparison.

Indeed. When Gold was the currency, major wars were usually very short, because war is very expensive. They had to ask the citizens to pay for it.
This is always how major empires crumbled in the past. They debased the money (mixing copper into the gold for example) to pay for war, which eventually ruined the system with debt.
Guess whats happening right now?

And you should never put private projects on company networks, that is a big no no and could even end with you getting terminated.

On taxes, most of the purpose of taxes in the US at least is to repay the principal interest on the loans that the US Government takes out with the FED. The Treasury and IRS were put in place when the Federal Reserve was, and this is by design.
Some of the tax money does go to certain programs, sure. But that isn't what your taxes really pay for mostly.
Think about it, why do they bother taxing you when they can literally just print more money whenever they want? Do you really think they get nearly a Trillion dollars a year to fund our bloated military from taxes? They take out more loans from the FED to give to their defense contractor friends, while creating wars to create a market. 
They don't need your money, they just want to enslave you financially through taxes, inflation, and other mechanisms that just transfer your wealth to them. It has nothing to do with your civic duty to contribute to society, that time is long gone.

If you want to change things, we have to change the money. Its that simple.
I hate to be cliche with "the root of all evil is money", but it actually is. Every war, every person whos died hungry, all of it is a symptom of a corrupt, unsustainable Keynesian system that just transfers wealth to those in power. 
These thieves have a total monopoly on money and its issuance, which has naturally led to total corruption in our governance and justice systems.
Voting in the next banker yes-man wont do jack shit. They wont change anything because they have no incentive to. We have to change it for them.
People say "why use Bitcoin its not any more convenient" blah blah blah. THIS is why you use it, not because its necessarily easier or better than than fiat for the job at face value, but because you want to change the world. Adopting Bitcoin is adopting rebellion against the corporacratic kleptocracy we are in now. 
Want rich, centralist financial facists to control every aspect of your financial life? Keep using Dollars, and don't bitch when they come for your money. They are now trying to remove cash from the equation entirely. Do you really want the state to be privy to literally every transaction you make?

Most have no idea the COMEX markets are a total sham. There is over 100x as much paper gold as there is real gold, and they are practically manipulating all of it in the open in order to get their hands on as much as possible.
If you don't hold it in your hand, it isn't real. If you have COMEX paper, all you hold is a promise.
Safe haven is anything that isn't fiat or otherwise paper markets. So keep right on hating metals while I scoop up as much as i can before the next massive clusterfuck coming to the financial sector.

That is definitely the failure of logic here. These goons keep acting like gold is a stock, which it isn't. It doesnt return interest or dividends. These assets also work on long time scales. If you look at a 20 year chart, we see a gully after the last giant rally. Now a bunch of hypernegative bearish gold-bashing from everywhere. Its time to buy.
I don't buy metals (real metals, not paper bullshit) right now because I think they will be worth a lot of Dollars. I buy it because no matter what currency becomes dominant in what I consider an emerging world currency war, metals will have a value in that currency. Metals have a portal gun to the other side in a currency crisis, and a little historic research certainly does show this to be true. 
Though the paper markets are also hilariously rigged. I believe when the dust settles that metals will be vastly repriced, hopefully in the right direction. Hard assets trump a rigged paper card game every time, and this time will be no different. 
So go ahead, keep gold bashing, Ill be buying until the only conversion available is Gold to Bitcoin.

You pretentious prats.
Fine, make this only about Bitcoin Core itself then if this is the only "true" version of Bitcoin to you. Its obvious there is a severe bias against XT here. That I don't have a particualar issue with, both sides have their reasons and both sides do have valid for and against arguments. 
But don't you **dare** tout yourselves as shepherds of a general Bitcoin community again, because you are with this very post outing yourselves as against general Bitcoin discussion here. This is no longer a Bitcoin sub, its a Bitcoin Core sub. 
Honestly reading this I don't think you guys even understand what you're saying. So every time a hard fork of the core code occurs its now an "altcoin" network? If that's the case then Bitcoin as we know it today is already one of these dirty altcoins you hate so much from the previous fork. This is ridiculous.
But, the fun part about cryptocurrency, and Reddit, is we all get a choice. I choose to say fuck this sub, its mods, and the crooks at Bitcointalk.org (arguably the Mos Eisly Cantina of Bitcoin forums). **Theymos I've followed Bitcoin for a long while now, and at this point I think you are a fraud, a phony, a fake, that has coerced the Bitcoin community for your own ends and no one elses. I think you are just pushing either your own agenda or pushing it for shadows behind the scenes with this insult of a flaccid post**
What you're doing isn't moderation, its just censorship. At least have the balls to call it what it is. 
see you in Im done with this fucking sham. 
@_date: 2015-07-22 04:01:36
Thats awesome you are looking into it, and I can respect its still tough to get through all the technobabble and fluff surrounding Bitcoin. Tons of businesses accept and use Bitcoin, more and more by the day in fact-
Generally I believe it unwise to be solely in Bitcoin unless you are very specifically targeting the Bitcoin community with your wares. Otherwise you are just losing a payment option that 99% of your customers can use, opposed to the 2% that know anything about Bitcoin. Its just not good business to do that. I hate fiat but I accept it in my shop for this reason. Until Bitcoin or something else is dominant, we can't pretend the USD no longer matters. 
Most suppliers, municipalities, and service providers don't deal with Bitcoin, so you need to have USD on hand for those things.
You would also be basing the value of your business on something that fluctuates, sometimes violently. That could be either really good or really bad, but definitely very risky. For all intents and purposes, Bitcoins value floats, Dollars don't. 
**Getting Started**
I would first look at something like Coinbase.com or Bitpay.com to handle your transactions. Coinbase for example lets you choose how much of the incoming Bitcoin is insta-converted into USD and sent right to your bank account. So you can choose how much or how little you use either currency. These companies specialize in handling these things for businesses. Many platforms now have options for Bitcoin, like Shopify (several choices of processor), Wordpress has plugins to integrate, and several others. Ive really liked Shopify myself, which is stupid easy to set up for both currencies. Coinbase also has an easy-button creator that is simple to insert into a website if you only have a couple products. Point being, there are many options to explore here, you will just have to look at them and pick. Only having used Coinbase myself, I would recommend it. 
For taxes, I would start here -  then speak to a licensed accounting professional (good practice for any business).
Otherwise it is difficult to cover every base here, but one step that cannot be missed is simply educating yourself, because if you don't understand it at least sort of, neither will your customers. 
 (bitcoin simulator!)
Of course, ask questions! That is what we're here for. Hope this helps

@_date: 2015-07-28 06:23:33
Well, any new technology such as this, particularly revolutionary ones, take time to gain traction.
Remember, just 6 years ago, Bitcoin was just a curious plaything worth $0 for bleeding edge programmers and cryotographers. Today its a multi-Billion Dollar enterprise that has spawned a whole new class of tech companies and products with more and more venture capital flooding in every day. The fact 10s of thousands of small and medium sized shops now accept Bitcoin is incredible in of itself and quite an accomplishment. A true grassroots movement if Ive ever seen one. 
The reality however is that Bitcoin does not even 1% of the transaction volume say, Visa or Mastercard does in one day right now. The world still very much runs on fiat currency. 
The interesting thing about blockchains (Bitcoin in this case) is that the units can act like a currency, stock, gold-like asset, and everything inbetween, so it is hard to classify. The IRS and FinCEN for example view Bitcoin differently, because the standard fiat definitions simply don't apply.
Until Bitcoin is truly dominant, its best to view and transact Bitcoin like you might gold or similar asset as its value is determined in fiat terms. As the regular trading world views Bitcoin more an asset than currency, so must we for now. I don't think that will always be the case however.

Open market is either 100% clean of any kind of moderation or censorship, or it isn't an open market. 
OpenBazaar is a commerce engine. If people sell drugs or scams and what not that is their business. Only by reputation will the good actors thrive, and the bad ones burn. 
What is "illicit" or not is in the eye of the beholder. Who decides what is and isn't? This is literally no better at all than the existing status quo that already does this with minimal effect (note that drugs, sex, guns, diddle porn, and all that "illicit" stuff is still traded no matter how many laws and police there are). Fighting natural market forces is both expensive and foolhardy, as the 30 year failed War on Drugs is more than enough evidence of. 
We've already tried closed, censored economics, and it doesn't work. It just creates a wasteful drag on society and ruins lives. The market finds a way. Reducing drug use, pedophiles, etc are social issues, not economic ones. You can't fix a societal issue with economic policy.

@_date: 2015-07-22 03:33:06
Oh sure, it happens every day in fact across all cryptos.
What makes Bitcoin different to me however is that this "manipulation" is more big traders poking the market for runners. Market liquidity is still so poor it actually doesn't take much to move the graph around usually, even just a handful of BTC will do it. 
Gold and other metals however are manipulated up and down by banks, international banks, hedge funds, etc, and many other methods that are deliberately malicious to the market, probably for private gains. This is a market cap of much higher order than Bitcoin as well, billions compared to trillions. It takes Bitcoins entire market cap to jolt the metals chart around. And Bitcoin is more a "real" market to me, as all metals trading is 100% paper. I imagine if that tie were broken, metals would be a lot more expensive at their real value. It seems like they are keeping the price hammered down in order to buy up as much as possible. 
So, yes and no lol, at least in my opinion as a trader/investor of both cryptos and bullion. 
@_date: 2015-07-18 15:41:50
Ive been buying gold, silver, and Bitcoin, all of which are priced to sell right now I think. Meanwhile, China for example has been hoarding gold like there is no tomorrow (and there might not be financially much longer).

Yeah..thats exactly how its supposed to work. Absolutely no one is stopping anyone from "fixing" these problems and rolling out their own version of Core. If everyone (or, mostly everyone) adopts it, it is effectively Bitcoin. The old one could still function as a fork but why would anyone choose the loser?
Open source allows for anyone to fix/hack/whatever the software at any time. Just because a VC backed firm is handling stuff doesnt mean Bitcoin is somehow become a proprietary patented system or something, its still 100% open.
And if the devs actually do screw this up? well, there are over 500 other chains to migrate to.

Another argument is simply physical supply. I buy real silver for this reason as it has many more industrial uses than gold, and tech manufacturing is only demanding more and more while reserves begin to run dry, and production has not increased to compensate. There is more paper supply than physical. 
No one wants gold or silver, which is why you want gold and silver. I keep gold, silver, Bitcoin, and a couple other cryptocurrencies in my end-of-world portfolio. I think it will all do very well in the near future.

Bitcoin is but the tip of the iceberg.
Blockchains represent a fundamental and permanent shift in cloud computing as a whole. It will change business, finance, even the Internet itself. Your chance to invest in it is now.
That said it is an investment, and if you choose to get in you have to treat it like one. I keep silver and gold too, but Bitcoin is the largest and most respected crypto network there is at the moment. Plus I just like seeing disrupted technology in action. 
As for mining heres the deal:
As a single person you will never make 1 dime mining. Big farms are able to either buy or produce their hardware at cost, you will however be paying retail, right there nullifying your hardware investment.
Mining is basically as follows: will you gain more buying Bitcoin right now or will the miner make more than that before it dies or difficulty renders it obsolete. You are essentially making 2 bets. Unless you are prepared to drop 10s of thousands on it, mining is an expensive hobby and nothing more. 
Youre better off just buying some BTC, storing it offline, and treating it just as any other investment choice. Buying today might be like buying Google stocks in 2000, at least is my personal opinion though I think all of this goes far beyond a simple declaration like Bitcoin is just a currency or asset, because it is a protocol first and foremost.

Well, Satoshi (who or whom) isn't Nostradamus. 
They built something that had never been tried before, of course there were future issues they never could have predicted. 
Which is why "but...Satoshi's vision!" can get fucked. It is our vision now, our problems to fix now. 
@_date: 2015-09-26 00:26:16
Essentially this.
Most here have a notion that Bitcoin is just a thing to replace the Dollar maybe, and that it will always have a fiat exchange rate. This is patently wrong. Blockchains are Internet transaction and trust protocols, first and foremost. We have to look beyond how things are today. 
Eventually these protocols will be just as subversive as the rest of them. Using Reddit? You are using TCP/IP and a host of other protocols without even knowing it. Bitcoin will become this way too. You wont see it working, it just will. 
Blockchains will eventually be driving a whole new kind of cloud or "Internet of THings". 
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:16:42
It can happen, but the chances of it happening are so infinitesimally small its not worth worrying about. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 22:42:54
To be fair most of us are not programmers I think, why this wasn't the first thing said about it a long time ago is beyond me. 
Some of us need it spelled out. Yes I can look at the code all day, however as I don't know this stuff its meaningless to me. 
@_date: 2015-09-27 15:50:54
No, DEVELOPERS will decide what to do with it because thats what it is for.
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:39:56
Lets all remember the hashrate graphs are not a live pulse, it is the sum aggregate of other data points. In otherwords, dont take the graphs as gospel, they can be wrong, and show the data wrong sometimes.
@_date: 2015-09-15 19:59:58
But that's bullshit. This isn't a proprietary software process so this method doesn't fit here.
There already exist several implementations of Bitcoin Core. Anyone with the skill can take it and create a new implementation. The variant that is most supported wins. Simple as that. 
I dont get why were trying to choose between just 2 versions. Its not like those are the only 2, or that someone else can create a new one that the majority can be satisfied with. 
If the devs cant agree then fuck them, let them split Bitcoin into two camps if it has to be that way. Open source directly supports this model of innovation and unrestrictedness. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 04:25:42
They just got $1,000,000 in VC funding to continue development, what do you mean? 
@_date: 2015-09-01 20:13:06
Openbazaar failed? It certainly has not.
@_date: 2015-09-18 14:51:20
Its designed to not require bureaucrats. They can do whatever they want, the free crypto-market doesn't care. Blockchains are their own transaction policy and authority.  
@_date: 2015-09-25 17:22:46
It doesn't work that way though. Bitcoin is push, not pull. 
The concept of micropayments is meant to be an end to the traditional subscription model.
Instead of paying for a service I pay for a small instance of that service. Paying a few cents to read an article instead of paying for a 30 day access to a site for example. I just pay for what I use as I go. Fiat cannot do that, but Bitcoin can. 
You are describing an incentive model that already exists.
@_date: 2015-09-16 13:20:50
That does bring into question what "Bitcoin" really is though. Is it still "Bitcoin" after a hard fork, or technically a separate coin or even an altcoin?
If it splits which one is "BItcoin" then?
The more and more I think about it I realized that there is no Bitcoin, only the most supported transaction protocol. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:23:11
Well actually yes they do. Most people do. Generally Bittorrent is something only tech people even know about even still today.
Even I pay for content when I believe it to be fairly priced, downloadable, and DRM free. 
You know why? Well most movie rips look like shit for one. Ill pay for a solid copy of something that looks good on my hi-def screens. 
And if this can turn those transactions into pennies then more people would be willing I think. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 23:32:39
Congratulations, you seriously have no idea what this device is or what its actually for. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 15:00:56
This isn't a mining machine, so this argument is invalid. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:35:15
Yeah...this isn't a miner...
It does that, but that isn't the purpose of having an ASIC chip on board. It is to generate some dust so the device can  perform blockchain transactions with 100% fresh coin. Anyone saying "isn't it easier to just buy BTC and put it on there" doesn't get what this little box is for. 
This is a dev kit so engineers can build embedded devices of their own using this as a test bed. 
This machine IS NOT for regular consumers, lets just get that straight. Most of you need to actually read the fucking articles and FAQs instead of all the bullshit being spread around here in this shit-heap of a sub. 
@_date: 2015-09-19 17:29:07
Wow, much better. I wonder if that one cost $100,000?
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:55:55
This is in fact how I envisioned Bitcoin working in the not so distant future.
Blockchains are 3rd generation Internet protocols, lets never forget this. To me we will someday use Bitcoin the same way we use TCP/IP: you will use it every day and never even know it. Every transaction you make will be handled in the background, seamlessly. 
If every PC, phone, tablet, whatever, had a much more condensed version of this prototype IoT device by 21, every machine could pay for content simply by turning it on, for example. Such a thing could even power a basic income network.
That is huge, and game changing. This here is the true revelation of Blockchain technology. Bitcoin as a simple currency was just the beginning of something much bigger. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:35:56
Its a dev kit, who gives a shit
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:35:47
Basically just running a node alone does not give it any value proposition. You actually have to do something with it to incentivize it. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:39:26
Though don't downplay Bitcoin like its super easy to track a real persons ID by following the blockchain. You can see the where and the what, but not why or whom (not directly). 
They got Ulbrict with basic policework, not because they are uber-1337 computer hackers or something. The idiot used his own name in a gmail address that was on the first forums where SR was advertised...
Had nothing to do with Bitcoin and everything to do with is piss-poor operational security, which is always the problem with these sites that get hacked and otherwise. 
Otherwise yeah, the only difference between a criminal and a representative of the government is one of those is state sponsored.
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:55:54
And so much the better, I hope more companies release their own version, and they will in time I think.
I dont get why everyone is chastising 21 for being first to the table with an IoT geared development box. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:39:46
Lol you guys, not a single one of you understand what this device is for apparently. 
And a Raspberri Pi doesn't have an ASIC on board, so its not the same thing. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:29:48
It will be fine. If they really push that hard we have much deeper problems then Bitcoin being attacked, because the governments will be attacking all of us at that point by limiting freedom through more dystopian laws and actions because they refuse to change or get out of the way.
Personally fuck the Oligarchy, I will do anything it takes to end their petty reign with this tech. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:43:52
It is useful, just not to everyday people BECAUSE IT ISN"T AN END USER DEVICE. 
When developers create new breeds of embedded hardware of their own and you find it in cell phones and laptops, then it is useful. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:39:02
IT ISNT an end user device. Its for developers. What part of this are people not getting?
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:33:42
I can actually attest to this issue.
I got a VPS to run a node...well...the blockchain is upwards of 50gb at this point.
Many VPS providers don't offer that much storage without a significant price hike. Im shelling out a bit of money now to host one (not detrimental but there is a definite personal cost to secure my own shit). And it will only get worse with time. 
In fact, Im already scouting co-location places near me to get my own server in there. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 19:46:53
This is why I say we have a long, looong way to go.
**Bitcoin is not decentralized.**
At the moment we are relying on private internet and private power to secure the network. That gives them far too much control. Just like this, what if Comcast decides it would just rather you not run Bitcoin related software?
We must remove greedy, power grabbing, totalitarian info-facists like AT&amp;T as well for Bitcoin to be truly free.
This is also why I believe block chains and mesh nets are bread and butter. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 14:51:47
Sigh...you are another one who thinks this is just a mining device. Its not and that is not the point of it. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:49:15
Value for machine to machine transactions is if the machines are buying and selling services and compute resources to eachother. This would be like an ad-hoc wireless network or something similar. 
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:55:20
Not near impossible so much as so prohibitively expensive to even attempt no one would bother. 
Not only would you need 220 Million Gh/s, you would need 51% more on top of that to gain network majority. So, someone would have to buy upwards of 360 Million Gh/s worth of machines and a large place to put them with lots of power. 
@_date: 2015-09-22 23:54:49
The public/private key is the DRM, but does it in a way where it isn't draconian style total control like theyve wanted in days past.
Imagine if a piece of music or a book could be managed by smart blockchain contracts instead of ancient copyright laws that simply have no meaning in the digital age. What if you could actually transfer ownership of that file for a price. These things can make piracy obsolete and unnecessary. 
@_date: 2015-09-10 16:18:55
In that as long as they are proprietary, it is no better than what we have already aside more automation and efficiency. But still would be privatly controlled systems. 
This announcement really isn't anything new, they are just starting a new Ripple basically. 
@_date: 2015-09-21 15:57:30
I also concur with this. When Bitcoin was first written there was no way to realistically tell what would be needed in the future.
The "original" vision is all well and good, but that vision was about a brand new technology that had not even been field tested yet. It was bound to need some alterations. Truth is Bitcoin as it is may be fundamentally flawed. 
And if you dont like it? well, there are 500 other networks to choose from. I dont understand why everyone thinks Bitcoin should be king for the sake of it. Several other chains have already solved some of these problems. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 13:24:34
How is life under the rock you're living at?
@_date: 2015-09-15 20:56:18
And with the title alone these senior nobodys have no concept of how open source works. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:30:20
So? Let them split the bastard in two if they can't figure it out.
Or did we all forget how open source works?
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:13:03
The problem is that these technologies are deliberately made to defy a bunch of know-nothing self-righteous bureaucrats trying to take control with dumb legislation where there needs to be none. 
Blockchains are the new free market, any attempts at subverting this principal should be met with all due force to stop it.
Its bad for innovation, bad for business, bad for the community. Look at how New York is turning out, notice how there are droves of Bitcoin businesses leaving because of their idiotic laws made by people who dont know a fucking thing about it.

He didn't understand from the beginning it wasn't his to spend.
@_date: 2015-09-08 19:42:55
What do you think you're using right now exactly? Reddit is basically just 1000s of forums. 
@_date: 2015-09-17 13:41:00
The FED cant escape its own influence at this point. They are just biding time until the inevitable and mathematically guaranteed failure of fiat, which has happened before many times. It will happen to the Dollar too. 
Blockchains represent a tidal shift in business computing. Its not just about money, its about reinventing how we transact with each other entirely. I dont think in the future "money" will be a word we use a lot. Using blockchains will be the same as you using TCP/IP right now to use Reddit. You won't even know, itll just happen, because these are 2nd generation internet protocols, not currency. 
@_date: 2015-09-30 04:26:55
Which is funny, considering all fiat is worth nothing at face value.
In fact, the 1 US Dollar is a unit of debt. Our "money" is actually worth less than nothing, it is owed to someone or something the second you have it. 
The entire system is based on debt. Blockchains however are not. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 00:05:00
You dont get it. This is meant for a world where there is no longer an exchange rate. You wont "buy" Bitcoin, ever. What they are trying to do is create a new class of Internet of Things device that generates its own BTC for being part of the network, just enough dust to transact with the blockchain. From there you can seamlessly do business with the Internet, other machines directly, and each other. You wont see any of this happening in the background, just like the TCP/IP protocol you are using right now to browse Reddit without knowing it, blockchains will work the same way. 
You seem to be under the impression this is like some kind of account you have to recharge. It isn't
@_date: 2015-09-16 15:05:17
Centralized power over his own stuff. 
Do you all not realize Theymos is not the lord and master of all Bitcoin related communities? He just happened to be one of the first if not the first to build a larger community around it.
Im starting my own stuff right now, you can too if you don't like it here or how much power Theymos has over it.
That said I DO NOT condone what he has done, its damaging to the community and childish. If he can't handle it he needs to step down. 
@_date: 2015-09-23 13:42:06
Well it isn't a fucking miner, its an IoT development device to help with embedding blockchain tech in everyday devices.
The device is just generating enough satoshi dust to do business with the blockchain, and thats it.
