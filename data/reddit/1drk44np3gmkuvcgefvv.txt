just did an experiment, went to circle and coinfloor and priced 1 btc:
coinfloor: £457
circle: £446.57

They mean crazy, zany, kooky- but in recreational dosage acid gives a very sober experience - more sober than regular consciousness, as you notice things your brain normally filters out as noise.

Exactly. I had a serious issue with a rental in Brazil (owner called the cops) and Airbnb wheeled out the big guns - local language speaking negotiators who resolved the dispute. I can't imagine renting direct from the owner - it's a huge risk for both parties.
@_date: 2016-08-23 13:28:23
Fair points. Note that you still can't buy bitcoin with faster payments in the UK (no bank integration). The financial capital of the world (london) isn't bitcoin ready let alone every other country. 2 years sounds ambitious to me but we can hope.
The good thing is that unlike a start-up, timing isn't an issue. Bitcoin can happily wait on the shelf until the world is ready for it.

thanks, i suspected as much but hadn't tested it. will give it a go.
@_date: 2016-08-30 23:13:32
curious, i see your order book has rather low prices i.e. £443/btc but when i go to your main page and enter £443 gbp it says i'd only receive .97 btc. 
which is right?
@_date: 2016-08-03 06:20:58
Wow, that is a staggering loss.
You're going to be alright though. It's just numbers on a computer screen. Your kids don't really care, you're still the same person you were yesterday. Resist the temptation to catastrophize the situation. Be Zen.
@_date: 2016-08-17 18:51:25
We were sitting there in the flat, deadlocked. Airbnb called the host on his mobile. I'll believe your moderation when I see it.
@_date: 2016-08-31 13:06:00
Well the sepa transfer is £10 and it only gets converted once as you can hold Euro deposits at bitstamp. But the banks exchange rate is bad.
There's no good way to buy bitcoin in the UK.
@_date: 2016-08-23 11:14:13
Integration with fiat bank accounts needs to be seamless before I can recommend it.
Hardware wallets need to be cheaper and easier to use, NFC for use with mobiles, etc.
The whole ecosystem needs to develop not just bitcoin. We're 5 years away at least.

How much did you lose? 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:33:52
250 btc in an online exchange, in a thread about an exchange hack. Makes sense...
@_date: 2016-08-18 13:54:06
Guess it depends on your definition of sober. In the words of Huxley, when the doors of perception are cleansed we see things as they really are... I see that as hyper sober, similar to the meditative state of consciousness.

I had rented the apartment as a single person and a friend stayed over the last night, the owner thought I'd ripped them off the entire time. We settled by paying him about $30.
Sounds silly now but very tense at the time when neither party spoke each other's language and they're on the phone to the police (allegedly - now I doubt he even called them or that they'd even care)
@_date: 2016-08-30 22:24:17
I have done but it doesn't compare apples to apples because it doesn't account for the costs to perform bank transfers and exchange currencies.
Also you have places like circle listed which I believe charge a premium, or is that just on credit card purchases? 
Anyway I have mainly used coin floor and bit stamp and I'm not sure which is actually cheaper.

Another bitcoin 101 film, haven't we seen this before? 
@_date: 2017-02-10 10:04:36
exactly. "greatly increase". doubling from 3txn/s to 6txn/s (or similarly small) is not a great increase but it's a "good enough for now" solution to help tackle the 70k txn backlog that exists today. buying us time to develop offchain &amp; other solutions.

The market agrees that it's only worth 10-20b as yet. I'd say that's fair since scaling remains a limitation and a fork looms. Maybe when 1.0 is released + lightning.

This is what I'm thinking. The threat hasn't registered on their radar yet but if we ever begin to see mass adoption you can bet the army shows up at these mining farms.

Are the contract block times still limited to the scale and speed of the bitcoin network? Waiting 10-20 minutes each time you interact with a contract is not going to be useable.

are you saying that the bitcoin network is computing a number of hashes per second that equal the number of stars in our galaxy?

To add to this, who checks that a transaction is valid? Does this happen at the new block mining, must the miner verify each transaction to include in the next block?
