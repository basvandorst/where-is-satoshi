I have seen people either assuming it will crash or wishing it would crash all over the place. One post I saw was even mentioning how neo-nazis were using it or getting rich off of it and they said it should fail just because of that.
It's like..The entire world has gotten rich off of money and various other commodities, but lets trash this one cause we don't like it just cause some bad guys are using it.

The people wanting it to crash so they can buy will just say 'see I told you it would crash'.
The amount of people I see hoping for it to crash because they don't have any is staggering.

Yeah I was using it and coinbase asked me to switch

This is my biggest fear rn

I've been using coinbase and they just asked me to update my 2fa to a better one

Very cool! I did a 24 hour stream not that long ago to help raise money for flood victims. It seems like there are so many people in need right now I don't envy you having to choose.

My response to the person above you:


@_date: 2014-09-17 13:36:23
I hate to say it, but if you are stupid enough to write 'see ID' on the back of your card, we probably don't want it anyway. I'm wasn't trying to be rude at first, but it really is invalid. You're in violation of the terms of service of your card and if you have fraud it would be on our heads and yours if something happened because they use your signature to match.

Where I work, we get screwed by chargebacks on a regular basis, probably to the tune of hundreds of thousands of dollars a day, from women calling in to dispute charges on a husbands card (or a husband doing it in front of a wife) to stolen credit cards to straight up friendly fraud (which is a term meaning the person knows they are doing it and its their card).
Its not worth it (its an adult site) to take that many people to court over it. Chargebacks are partially for disputes, but the reality is that they are done by the credit card company almost instantly in cases of fraud. In some cases we get chargebacks because a person's credit card was stolen somewhere else and the company automatically charged back everything that happened in a particular amount of time.
What happened to OP is the 4th thing in this (from wikipedia)
With each chargeback the issuer selects and submits a numeric reason code.[3] This feedback may help the merchant and acquirer diagnose errors and improve customer satisfaction. Reason codes vary by bank network, but fall in four general categories:
Technical: Expired authorization, non-sufficient funds, or bank processing error.
Clerical: Duplicate billing, incorrect amount billed, or refund never issued.
Quality: Consumer claims to have never received the goods as promised at the time of purchase.
Fraud: Consumer claims they did not authorize the purchase or identity theft. 
The last reason is the most common for chargebacks. The person who actually made the chargeback was disputing fraud.

Some gift cards charge a 'non use' charge, which is totally bizarre but it happens and they just take the money out of the card.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:30:27
It was our store policy, because its against the terms of the credit card company. It is also a really good chance to teach people that their card is not valid because if you DO end up with fraud, its all on you.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:56:54
America, and our system is ridiculous. My boyfriend just had his bank card numbers swiped AGAIN, for like the 4th time this year, this time it was Home Depot.
We need to get with the program. I can't believe we're still using mag stripes.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:01:22
Not only that, its not part of their terms of service nor would they accept it.

I have a couple, and getting beta coin. We'll see how that goes.

He said that he did not intend for anyone to send them money. Chill out.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:04:42
What's odd is that it never happened but where I work now (customer/accounts for an adult site) we have people that we would love to get rid of as customers but they always want to come back :/
@_date: 2014-03-25 11:42:57
It could get them banned from CB, be careful.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:51:20
Small print man, that's how they get you. Its not valid otherwise.
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:19:41
Its not tough love to tell someone they fucked up after they've already been fucked over, that's just being mean. Its possible to tell people how to better protect themselves that doesn't degrade to straight up blame.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:50:57
Merchants are not supposed to ask for ID, and they don't really understand that. So many stores tell their cashiers to ask for ID for every transaction and they don't even know its against the terms of service.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:05:51
Ok, not stupid, just a really really bad idea. If it says 'SEE ID' on the back of someone's card, they generally won't sign it because they think they are right or that its okay to do that, when it really isn't.
If you have worked in retail why do you not sign your card? It doesn't make any sense.
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:17:41
I hate when people victim blame. I saw it all over the front page when people had their nudes stolen. People can be heartless jerks.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:48:14
I have a similar issue with my signature, which is why I just make it as quickly and shitty as I can when I sign my card. I have perfected a shitty/fast signature that matches.
Also, most people don't know this, but its actually against the terms of service for both Mastercard and Visa to ask for ID for credit transactions. They are supposed to be matching it to the signature.
@_date: 2014-04-18 06:43:23
And that's exactly what they said about bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:54:25
So, the purchaser was using a stolen credit card. The purchaser more than likely sold the cards. There is a possibility they were invalid in many cases. Where I work, people use cards purchased on Ebay all the time, and I have no doubt that many of them have been purchased fraudulently originally.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:11:12
Nope, probably America.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:00:20
Visa and Mastercard would not allow you to use ID to verify a card. They ask that you match the signature.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:10:35
Guessing you don't work in retail. Pissing off a credit card processor is a bad idea.
@_date: 2014-10-24 08:19:15
I don't know. I see it all over the other subs. I had a slew of negative votes when I dared tell people to stop shaming those that got their nude photos stolen.
@_date: 2014-09-17 13:03:27
This is certainly possible. Unfortunately with credit card fraud, its hard to say when it happened. A chargeback can happen months to years after the fact when the original owner notices the charges. By that time, the thief could have flipped them and they could be used.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:57:40
It depends. There's more than one way to steal a credit card. If the thief printed it himself, he could have signed it as well.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:17:00
We can only ask if the card is unsigned, and then we are asking them to sign it in front of us.
@_date: 2014-05-31 10:14:52
*fool proof
Hopefully this is the case. I know that people contact my site all the time and report security issues and there usually isn't an issue, but it doesn't mean that we blow the customer off and don't take it into full consideration.
If there's an issue like this, you should have a reference somewhere that explains that your site is secure that you can send someon who asks these questions. Definitely better than snarky retorts.
I do customer support/account support/admin for a living for people who spend hundreds of thousands of dollars a day, and even if I don't know what they spend, they get more respect than that. That being said, we have email support instead of chat to keep us from having issues like this.

They didn't spend a dime because it wasn't their credit card in the first place.

There are most definitely seats for disabled and they help people into them.
@_date: 2014-09-17 12:52:28
When I see 'ask for ID', I return the card and tell them its not valid, because its not.
@_date: 2017-02-01 07:31:59
everyone looks down or stares at their phones

While true, you'll end up with this many people on every train during rush hour, and it lasts a couple hours.

Yeah that's what I didn't understand. People will pack one car to the brim and ignore the half empty ones.
