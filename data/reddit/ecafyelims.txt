That statement is definitely a knock on Kim's weight, so John does sound like a bully.  It's unfortunate because I do like John, but he's publicly shaming someone's weight in response to a PM calling him a bully -- that's not cool.
@_date: 2016-08-18 15:42:40
You're right, it's been around a long time, but being old doesn't make it right.  The old homage, "Sticks and stone may break my bones, but names will never hurt me" Isn't true.  Names (and words in general) can definitely hurt.  They can even cause psychological damage.  Don't believe me? Call your wife (or friend/sister/whoever) a fat lazy whore, and see if it hurts her.
John did the equivalent of, "Kim told me to stop bullying him in a private message.  Everyone, look how fat he is!"
Maybe John doesn't think he's being a bully.  Maybe John thinks there's nothing wrong with bullying.  Maybe John knows better and just doesn't give a fuck.  I don't know, but publicly teasing Kim's weight certainly didn't help prove that he's not a bully.
@_date: 2016-08-18 13:36:02
Kim didn't complain.  He told John in a PM that he's a bully.  Adults handle bullying by confronting or ignoring them.  Kim chose the former, and John must have been unsettled by it.

@_date: 2018-01-21 16:19:21
You're right of course. I never said high fees will kill Bitcoin, but I did say that the price would be higher with lower fees. Gold gets its value from utility and store of value. People use it as store of value because they feel it will be worth more in time, and that perception is based on gold's utility.
Bitcoin has value based on utility and store if value too. As the value of utility changes, so does the price. If Bitcoin can or can't support certain transactions, that will of course affect the price, but it will not kill Bitcoin. You are right.

@_date: 2018-01-26 18:54:14
Remember though that these futures are settled on cash -- meaning that to open a long or close a short, you don't need the actual Bitcoin.
That said, yes, the long holders have motivation to buy bitcoin as the price decreases, but do they have the means? 
The shorting group has a huge advantage here. They bought the Bitcoin before the future launch in preparation. The longing group didn't have a similar option at the time. This means that the shorting group can over inflate the price of BTC before the future market launched. This leaves the longing group at a disadvantage because they are positioned against an overbought market.
The other side of this is that if the longing group had known about the shenanigans of the shorting group, they could have not purchased longs on the future and instead planned a trap and waited for the shorting group to sell the bitcoin only to buy the long and Bitcoin at a much cheaper price.

What? They are the largest USD to BTC exchange, and you feel they are anti Bitcoin? Because they didn't rush out your feature request? Do you have any idea what it takes to modify a system of that size while ensuring there are zero vulnerabilities?
Even if Coinbase doesn't use segwit, they are not forcing anyone to keep their coins there after purchase. If segwit is a high demand item, people will move their coins into segwit wallets.
Personally, I still don't know why we didn't get segwit and 2x. We'd already have faster transactions and lower fees even for non-segwit addresses.

@_date: 2018-01-12 05:44:12
Thank you for the well-thought response. I appreciate it.
I totally get what you're saying, but two things don't connect for me.
First, you say that "Literally, it will do jack fucking shit to raise it to 8mb" but if the mempool is full, and the blocks are 1mb, then logically increasing the blocks to 8mb will allow 8x the throughput. This doesn't make sense to say it wouldn't help. By the same logic, then the increased throughput via Segwit doesn't help either as it only offers 2-4x
Second, this:


So, Segwit and LN don't eliminate the on-chain fees. You still have to pay the on-chain fees to get your coins in/out of any LN. Also, the largest lighting nodes would be the most beneficial to join, so it could lead to a more centralized system of a few lighting nodes controlling the majority of the currency and thereby be more easily shut down, I would think.
Help me connect the dots, please.  I'll be signing off here for the night, but I'll check back again tomorrow to read. Thanks.

@_date: 2018-01-21 11:26:07
It's supply and demand.  If the mempool is full because of high demand, that's going to increase the price. If it's empty because of low demand, that will lower the price.  We want the mempool to clear due to issues being fixed, not due to users moving to cheaper alternatives.

And they are still the top USD to BTC exchange. If they were anti BTC, there are very effective ways the top US exchange could hurt BTC.
They aren't anti BTC. They are pro profit. If there was no profit in listing LTC or Ether, they wouldn't do it. They are following the market. If you feel anything is anti BTC, start looking there. I feel the market and Coinbase are very pro BTC. Not as a pro as they were a month ago, but I can't fault the market for not doing what I wish.
@_date: 2017-12-06 18:52:30
Looking at bitcoin average, we're floating at about $6 average fee per transaction. 
That's the average, with it spiking at $19 last month, so I can definitely see some outliers going to $20 per transaction. Regardless, even $6 is too high of a fee for most games on steam.

Just like stealing top-secret plans.  You don't have to actually steal the paper they are written on; if you take a photo of the plans, it's still stealing.
Look at it this way.  I have information that I plan to sell for $1000.  You sneak into my house and copy that information.  Then, you sell it for $900, and therein you just made my original copy of the information worthless.  I lost financially because of your theft.  I put in significant labor and expense obtaining that information, but you put in very little effort to steal it.
You copied my information and depleted it of value.  It's theft.
In terms of bitcoins, what happens if I copy your private key and then use it to deplete your wallet of value. Even though you still have your original copy of the private key, that would still be theft, would it not?

* Deposited $600k worth of BTC on GDAX
* Liquidated at market rate
* Requests an exception to daily withdrawal limit
* Request denied
* Requests again.
* Second request denied.
* Requests again. Third request isn't allowed.
Here's the deal, that daily limit existed as soon as you opened the GDAX account. You agreed to that daily limit. You could have requested the daily limit be increased **prior to depositing the BTC**, but you didn't plan ahead. 
I'm not shocked that your request was denied. Depositing and immediately liquidating $600k in BTC looks suspicious because you lose a lot of value in transactions like that. It might be legit, but it's also pretty common of scammers and stolen accounts.

These people didn't ask "pretty please" to lose their money.
Robbery isn't illegal or justified -- even if the transaction isn't supervised by a "higher authority."
Bitcoin is about allowing people to do as they wish with their money, so if they want protection, then bitcoin is about that for those people.
Naivety does not exonerate the "robber," even when it's obvious what he was doing. If that was the case, a robber could target only naive people, make it obvious that he's going to rob them, then rob them, and he would be exonerated.
By definition, people do not choose to be naive, but even if they did, being robbed is still not their fault. You sound like those people who feel women deserve to be raped if they walk alone down the street or get too drunk to fight off an attacker.

It's not a public good yet; you first need to get our elected lawmakers to define it as such.
Just like when my city cleans the streets.  The service that allows that to happen is paid by tax payers for the benefit of the tax payers, but the funds to do so were first earmarked by a bill introduced by a city lawmaker.
Some local tax payers may not want to pay for clean streets, but they helped dirty those streets, so they should help pay to clean them.  Maybe they didn't help dirty those streets, but the cost to investigate such a claim would far exceed the tax itself.

The authorization over OAuth doesn't bother me.  It's the fact that I can't withdraw bitcoins without agreeing to the TOS that bothers me.  I should be able to PM a bitcoin address and the bitcoins are sent there if I like.  Or, I can sign up and keep the private key in the hands of changetip.
You think I have an "endless laundrylist of reasons" why I won't use it, but that's not true.  It's only that one issue.  The fact that the bitcoins are trapped until you agree to the TOS (which can change at any time) worries me and goes against the bitcoin ideal. I'm not going to use it or encourage anyone else to use it. If they allowed withdraws without agreeing to the TOS (and this was stated in the TOS), then I would support and use it.
Sure the last time they updated the TOS they gave warning, but there is no such requirement in the TOS going forward.  They could change it right now; just because they didn't the last time doesn't mean they won't the next time.
If dogecointip bot decides to change their TOS to be just as shady, then I'll have to withdraw my dogecoins and stop using it. I'll be sad, but I won't support a company that forces a TOS to receive crypto tips -- especially when refusing the TOS forfeits your coins and that TOS can change at any time.  Damnit, if I have to write my own tip bot to protect users, I will.

I'm still not sure what you're upset about.  It's difficult for companies to run exchanges, and it's more difficult when dealing with micro transactions.
For now, they're only allowing big players. That may change in time.
This is inevitable if Bitcoin is going to become accepted globally.  You say the price is too high for you, but the alternative is ultimately stagnation.  Bitcoin will never really compete with fiat if big players don't get involved.

Their TOS specifically states they can change the TOS at anytime and you won't be allowed to use the service in any way (even to withdraw your bitcoins) until you agree to the new TOS.

I agree with the first sentence, but the second can't be inferred as it varies from person to person.


You should use a wallet as an example rather than a home.
Giving someone untrustworthy my wallet does increase the chance of loss of the contents.  However, giving my wallet to an established, secure, and reputable institution is probably safer than keeping it on my person since I don't have security guards protecting me.
Also, when you add the qualifier "via a personal mistake," it kind-of weasels out of a lot of accountability. Mistakes happen. None of us are perfect, and so these mistakes should be taken into consideration when figuring any increased risks. Besides, "mistake" is subjective and sometimes hard to hold someone at fault for it.  Was it a mistake to use the brainwallet's "random" key generator? Yes, but most of us didn't know that until it was found flawed.
The way I look at it, we all need to know the risks of each option -- using a managed wallet vs using your own wallet. Many people have lost btc from both, and we need to be honest about them rather than just blanketing the conversation with a statement saying it's better to hold the keys yourself; we don't learn from that sort of thing.

Yea, who knows what the future will bring, but if they go through the trouble of writing a TOS, I expect that it is written to match their plans current and future, and any holes in the TOS are there intentionally. 
If I want to tip a user $5 in bitcoins, I shouldn't have to worry if they like the TOS of a third party vendor.  Just like if I give someone a check for $5, I don't have to worry they might not like the TOS at my bank.  They can open an account, but it's not required.

It's just that the examples in the video had nothing to do with the financial industry, and they're very specific examples in specific cities.
I agree that over regulation stifles innovation and new business, but the examples in the video have absolutely nothing to do with financial or federal regulations. The comparison is not valid.
I don't care what people say in here, financial regulation at some level is necessary.  The laws were written in blood because bad things happen when bankers are allowed to do whatever they want.
People will say, "well, if you trust a MtG exchange with your bitcoins, then it's your own fault." Sure, but bankers are pretty smart.  They'll screw you of your money as quickly as a sheering wool from a lamb, and if they had it their way, you would have zero legal recourse.  A little regulation is necessary to protect fish from the sharks.
"I don't want your protection" Yes, that's what everyone says before they realize they do need it.  Look who is trying to eliminate financial regulations now.  It's the bankers and the politicians funded by the bankers.  They have everything to gain, and we have everything to lose.
Yes, the regulations as stated by the NY DFS go overboard, but they are meant to start that way because when they take comments and they loosen regulations, it's seen as a win.  If they started loose and tightened regulations, people would be more upset.
Also trust that the big players in this want regulation even less than we do.  Give your comments, and they'll give theirs.  The law will be different than the proposal.
Sorry for the rant.  I know my viewpoint is unpopular here, but that's fine with me.

That was a big part of the sub.  Take away memes from Advice Animals (which is still a default) and see if people are fine with it. 
They should have realized if you force a change like that on an existing user base, people will be upset about it. Then, the mods only fanned the flames of the users' anger.  
They took polls and then ignored the results because they didn't like them. They promised to reverse the rule if it didn't work out but then kept it. They later promised to stop making changes without getting feedback first, but didn't keep that promise either. They made fun of their user base publicly and joked about it on SRD and circlejerk.

2. It's possible there was more information on the network that the researches weren't able to log. For example if an attacker had control of many nodes very close (physically) to Mt. Gox, and were somehow able to send out their modified transactions faster and "better", then it's possible the authentic transactions were killed before being recorded by the researchers.
3. As the researchers admit, we can't see how Gox actually reacted to the modified transactions. Gox resent transactions using different inputs (or addresses, even) so it's very hard to detect a resend. If they were to release their records of all withdrawal requests we could compare them to the blockchain and find any discrepancies, but they haven't done that (and it's possible they don't have complete records anyway).

Well, I would argue the statement is not semantically correct because you say "there is no **risk** of theft seizure or loss..." Although, you wouldn't have actually "lost" the bitcoin until the keys are not exclusively yours, the risk of theft, seizure and loss are still real and present.  
Even if you have the only keys printed on paper and in-hand, there is the **risk** of you getting mugged at gunpoint or misplacing the paper or a fire ruining it, etc.

First, the amount you can store is limited by the number of bitcoins you have which can never be unlimited.
It's not only theft you need to worry about. It's loss in general. Sure, the thief cannot get your coins, but maybe he only wanted your computer, and a side effect was that you lose access to your coins. or a fire takes out your computer and offline paper wallets.  Or they become otherwise illegible -- what do you do?  Multiple backups in varied locations.
You become unable to remember where your backups are, what do you do?  Write them down? okay, it's bip38.  Oh, man, don't forget your password! Crap, what if you die or just become paralyzed? You need to keep a record of these passwords, and you have the same issue with that record.
The point is that you either have to go through a lot of hoops to ensure your security against loss and theft or you can trust a company to do it for you.  Most people won't have the technical knowhow and persistence to do it themselves.

That API is great if our financial software integrates it.  I don't know enough about Sage 50 to even know if we can update the software to use the bitpay API (and the amount I do know about the software makes me believe it's not possible).  Changing our entire financial process to not use an out-of-the-box software isn't feasible either.

Banking regulations have prevented much worse.  Look pre-regulation times which led to the great depression.  The laws were written blood because you can't trust bankers to do the honest thing when given license to do as they wish.
Seriously, regulation isn't bad when done properly.  I get you don't like the NY DFS's proposal, so write and comment, but don't expect them to allow businesses to operate unregulated.  
Bankers are smart and crooked, and they have all day all year to think of ways to make more money. Given the chance, they will cheat and steal from every single user and leave all of you without a legal recourse for recovery.  It's happen before in every country of the world.  That's why the laws are there. If bankers were trustworthy, the laws would have never been written in the first place.

Thank you for providing the OAuth screencaption.  I know what OAuth is because I'm a developer who's used it myself. It's great that I don't have to agree to OAuth's TOS in order to use it, isn't it?
I understand your point that this is a company and this company chooses to force everyone to agree to a TOS. Hey, I understand.  However, I didn't have to agree to Reddit's TOS to read posts from Reddit users.  I didn't have to agree to Gmail's TOS to receive emails from Gmail users.  I didn't have to agree to blockchain.info's TOS to receive bitcoins from blockchain users.
There is no functional reason to make me agree to changetip's TOS to receive tips from changetip users, and the fact they do so anyway makes me suspicious of their ultimate intentions.
You and I both know not to keep a lot of money with changetip or any other such provider.  I'm not worried about you. I'm worried about the users as a whole.  $5 here $10 there over thousands of different users who never withdraw. That's my concern.  Sure, they haven't done it yet, but they wouldn't until they do and then it's too late, and it's all in the TOS, so it's legal -- or at least a good fight in court for your $10.
Speaking of their last change -- they could change the privacy settings back right now (where they sell your information and charge inactivity fees), and you would have to abandon your bitcoins if you didn't agree to it.  And the kicker is that you agreed that you would abandon your bitcoins should that happen. All the changetip users agreed to do the same.

Sometimes the best defense is a good offense.
I agree the military has grown out of control, but its budget is approved every year by Congress, who are voted into office by citizens.
If citizens cared enough to change it, then Congress would act to change it. Personally, I think the military is used improperly, but I like that it is strong enough to deter any foreign attacks against us and or allies without actually going to war.
You call it a perfect monopoly, but the equipment is mostly provided by private companies who bid to do it. That's not a perfect monopoly by any measure.
If the taxation was without representation, then I could agree it's closer to theft, but you have representation. If you don't like the tax, then vote and encourage like-minded individuals to do the same. However, if you want to declare all taxes as theft, you may have a difficult time finding a new representative who will work without salary (which is paid from taxation).

The fact that you spliced two independent clauses using only a comma makes it a run-on sentence.  I was just helping you by pointing out how you could have fixed it.
An independent clause is a complete thought. It can stand by itself as a complete sentence.  Your run-on has two of them.
1. No, it's a fucking reddit comment
2. get over it.
There are several ways to fix this.  You can separate them with a period so they are two individual sentences. You can combine the two clauses with a conjunction (e.g. and, but, or). You can combine them with a semicolon if the two clauses are closely tied together.
However, if you splice two independent clauses with just a comma, then your sentence becomes a run-on.
Here's some helpful reading for you: 
Also, very good job separating your two clause with a period in your last comment.

As for dogecointip, if they update the TOS without warning or option to withdraw without agreeing, then I'll abandon the coins.  I only have a few thousand there anyway, and they aren't worth much. Maybe I'll withdraw them now in anticipation of the TOS change.
Changetip has all the signs that it plans on selling once it is successful.  That's why the TOS is left wide open and they give users no option to leave without agreeing to the new TOS. It makes for good business, but not something I want to agree to.
In case I miss it, if changetip does enable withdraws without agreeing to the TOS, please let me know. I'll start tipping with it.

Here's my chiropractor story.
So, my wife had occasional back pain, and a friend of her's convinced her to go see a chiropractor.  I tried talking her out of it, but she went anyway.
After the session, she was in a lot of pain, but the guy assured her that the pain was just her body adjusting, and she should come back the next week.  She did.
She started going every week, and she was no longer in great pain after the visits, but she was still getting occasional back pain.  The sessions weren't fixing the problem.
So, she stopped going. Mistake.  It's like she was addicted to the chiropractor.  I can't explain why, but she started having excruciating pain if she went more than two weeks without going.  She would go back and the chiropractor would "adjust" her and the pain would subside.  
She told him about what was happening and he said that after you start getting weekly adjustments, you shouldn't really ever stop. It sounded too much like a scam -- after all, he didn't fix the original issue, he only added a dependency.
We decided to chance it and she stopped going and dealt with the pain.  It lasted about four weeks and then she was back to normal occasional pain.
I know one experience can't be used for any sort of statistic, but IMO, it's a scam.

Is it really that radical of a change? I'm a developer myself, and I know things are never as easy as they sound. However it doesn't sound like a radical change to allow users to accept tips into their wallet rather than a changetip account.
Even as a quick workaround, when a user PM's a btc address, create a temporary user account and withdraw the btc to the address given.

I'll save you a click. The article is talking about Ethereum. 


I'm not sure it is a great idea to connect wealth with correctness.  It could easily be abused if one party puts up more collateral than the counterparties. That person would then gain more wealth and thereby an increased ability to abuse the system again.
But if things go wrong, we can just roll the blockchain back again.  Go for it.  Oh, wait, who would approve the rollback without miners?  Would it be the wealthiest holders?  Would that include the guy who just abused the new system to become the wealthiest holder? I'm not so sure about this.
Whatever direction we decide to take ETH, good luck.

That doesn't matter. They paid what free-market rate for your services, and your debt is paid.
The interest on the fed loans are very little.  You would (usually) earn much higher gains on the money simply by investing it.
So, you could even pay back a fed loan by investing wisely and then paying back the loan.

Do you think that the only way to get money is via a loan from the Federal Reserve?  That's not true.  Money existed before the Federal Reserve.
I'll give you a simple example:
Let's say you owe $1 to the Fed gaining interest at 0.50%.  Your friend, Bob, owes nothing to the Fed.  He's not in debt at all.  He's never borrowed money from the Fed. He's never received money from anyone who borrowed from the Fed. 
Bob buys your services for $2.  You pay off your $1.01 to the Fed.  You are now both debt free.

Some will say that larger blocks will be a competitive disadvantage to Chinese miners, but I consider it fair because they already enjoy a significant competitive advantage on the price of power and labor. This is why the majority of the hashpower is coming from China.
Bitcoin was written to allow contentious decisions to be decided by votes from the bitcoin miners, and the miners are not voting for larger blocks.

I get what you're saying, but in all likelihood, neither BU or Segwit will ever reach overwhelming consensus without some sort of compromise.
Best case scenario means neither will ever trigger and we're stuck with slow transactions.  Worse case scenario, one group does a contentious fork, and we have two separate Bitcoin blockchains along with a PR mess.

Good Morning, Greg. Thank you for all of your hard work. If you would be willing, would you please read and give feedback on the segwit-bu compromise proposal [here](
@_date: 2017-03-07 14:13:37
Yes. Let's merge [BIP 102 (2MB HF)]( and [BIP 141 (Segwit SF)]( into a single HF (with overwhelming majority consensus).
Since Segwit changes how the blocksize is calculated to use weights, our goal with the merger would be 2MB of transactional data. 
Segwit weighting system measures the transaction weight to be 3x(non-witness base data) + (base data with witness data). This weight is then limited to 4M, favoring witness data.
Transactions aren't all of base or witness. So, in practice, the blocksize limit is somewhere between 1MB (only base data) and 4MB (only witness data) with Segwit.
With this proposed merger, we will increase Segwit weight limit from 4M to 8M.  **This would allow 2MB of base data**, which is the goal of the 2MB HF.
It's a win-win solution.  We get 2MB increase and we get Segwit.  What do you think? @_date: 2014-08-15 14:37:05

Sorry, what I meant to say is that even if 75% of miners show support for Classic, that has yet to mean they stop mining Core.
It could very well be that the miners divide hash power in an effort to minimize hash rate increases and thereby maximize bitcoins mined after the hard fork -- if the Core coins are still worth value.

Core isn't forced to change the PoW algo. That was my point.  It's only in Core's best interest to change the algo in the case of a 51% attack, but that may not happen if the miners choose to continue mining Core.
Alternatively, if the miners do not mine Classic, then Classic may be forced to change the PoW algo to prevent a 51% attack.
@_date: 2016-01-20 15:33:49


This will only be necessary if the majority of the miners leave Core.
Classic may instead be forced to change PoW algorithm if 51% attacked.

You didn't answer the question. How do you programmatically decide if the hard fork has consensus?
@_date: 2017-08-22 19:55:50
Each node will decide a block is valid bases on the client software. If the software is running segwit2x, then those blocks will be valid to the node.
Regarding your last point.  How do you decide consensus to hard fork without the miners?
@_date: 2017-08-23 13:30:06


When the community sees they only need to change node software to have confirmed transactions, they might just do it.  
Also, the miners may be considering the long-term profitability, in that this protest will be more profitable in the long term. It's similar to when laborers go on strike. They will lose a few day's pay striking, but they also hope to make more money in the long term.
@_date: 2017-08-23 18:37:14
The miners are still able to mine for short term profits, while keeping the long term goals. They would just instead mine BCH or their own Bitcoin.
It's not a prisoner's dilemma, but whether or not they do it is another question.  I'm hoping that either the Miners back down or Core agrees to 2X.
@_date: 2017-08-30 21:16:01
But if that becomes untrue, we can fork, right?
@_date: 2017-08-01 13:07:54
On a related note, this is why you can't use the count of active nodes as a gauge for user support. It's too easy to just spin up temporary nodes to make a vote.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:42:26
I think you give a solid reason for not using 2X in that we don't know what will happen, and compounded with Segwit, there is no need to take that risk right now. I would agree with you if the alternative was risk-free, but with Segwit2X, there is a significant risk.
However, your analogy isn't right. As of right now, Miner and Core aren't volleying for lanes. They are in the same car on the same road trip. Let me try.
**Core and Miner are sharing a car on a roadtrip together**. They've been on this road trip a long time. Disagreements have happened, of course, but these two have always been able to work things out.
**The two of them make a good team.** Core plans the trips and maintains the car, and Miner drives. They have a lot of fun doing it and have a good number of followers on their instagram, which helps pay for the expenses.
On this current leg of their road trip, they arrive at Segwit City. Miner plans to visit 2X City next and then continue the road trip, but the drive will be hard on the car, and so, Core doesn't want to visit 2X City -- not yet, at least. 
**Miner really wants to visit 2X City.**  He doesn't get to pick destinations often because Core does the trip planning. 2X City is so important to Miner that he is willing to get his own car and drive to 2X City without Core. Core might be okay with that.
**So, does Core:**
* Ignore Miner's request, and continue the road trip as planned without visiting 2X City
* Visit 2X City with Miner and then continue the road trip as planned
**With the 1st option**, Miner is hurt and feels betrayed by his partner. The shared road trip is over. Miner will soon need help trip-planning and maintaining the car.  Worse, if the car breaks down on the hard drive to 2X City, Miner may be stuck on the roadside until getting help with repairs. Core, on the other hand, is stuck at Segwit City until he finds a new driver. Core and Miner both worry that they will lose a large chunk of instagram followers, which will make it that much harder to pay for expenses and find help. It could delay the road trip significantly.
**With the 2nd option**, crisis averted; Miner is happy, and the team is still together, but Core is upset because his hand was forced and now the plan for the road trip is delayed a bit. Core's also worried that the car may break down during this hard drive to 2X City.  If it does, it may need some serious repairs before they can continue. It could delay the road trip significantly.
I don't have any influence in Core's decision, but if the Miners follow through with Segwit2X, it would hurt Bitcoin a lot. The public would be split, and Bitcoin (the Core's version) would be dead in the water without miners, until the difficulty dropped or was reset with a hard fork. In that time, many of the nodes may switch to Bitcoin (the Miner's version) just so transactions get confirmed in a timely manner.

Segwit2X is a result of the [New York Agreement (NYA)](
@_date: 2017-08-24 01:01:43
Thanks for replying nullc.
My worry is that if the miners follow through and stop mining Core's version of Bitcoin, then transactions will take days to confirm.  Many businesses can't afford that, so they will use the sw2x version of Bitcoin. That's the free market at work. When businesses use it, many (not all) users will follow.
This causes two popular versions of Bitcoin without replay protecting.
Like you said, miners have nothing to lose and everything to gain. One strategy in chicken is to remove the steering wheel. A better one is to avoid consequences by having someone else drive. That's what the miners are doing. Either way, they don't lose.
It's a shame too, because the majority of users don't control the cars. We can only pick a car to sit in, and they are both going to crash.
You say Core isn't the one playing chicken with the miners, but I disagree. If core added 2x, nearly all nodes would follow suit, and the crash would be averted.
True, it's a shame that Bitcoin can be manipulated like this, but that doesn't change the fact that it can and will happen. Just as the UAHF and UASF campaigns demonstrated, Bitcoin can be manipulated by these threatening tactics, even if we don't like it. That doesn't make Bitcoin worthless though. Bitcoin is worth more than ever.
What will make Bitcoin worthless is an internal political fight that stalls transactions, defeats trust, and pushes user confidence toward competing currencies. I hope we avoid the crash.

That isn't the entire argument.  That is only the first point.
We're a group traveling to two different destinations nearby each other. If the group can agree on going to both destinations, then we can travel together and split all the work/costs. 
If one group insists on only going to their own destination, then the group splits so that each part can independently travel to where they wish to go.  In this case, it'll be much harder for each fraction of the group to get to their destinations.

The miners are able to see if the Core Bitcoin is being mined.  It's not a secret if it's being mine, even if they are able to hide who is doing the mining.
In the prisoner's dilemma, the requirement is that each doesn't know if they are betrayed.
Also, one miner betraying the others would not cause the others to fail, as in the prisoner's dilemma.  It would take several miners, so the risk of being betrayed (and fear therein) is much lower.
Also, they are not facing a zero-profit consequence if they can still mine other coins. In this case the consequence is slightly less profit, and that may not be enough to cause betrayal.

Gotcha. So, how is consensus determined non-programatically then? Currently, we use majority hash power to decide, but that won't work without miners.
Are we going to use online polls? Are we electing representatives to decide? Or maybe trusting some other central group to decide consensus for us?
I'm still fuzzy on how consensus is decided in a minerless Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:51:36


Some miners are thinking long-term profit over short term profit. Missing a few days work while "on strike" will be worth it for them if they succeed and gain 2X with greater profit over the long term.


Of course. Some people, especially those who do not spend coins, won't care about transaction times.  Businesses, on the other hand will be the ones affected the most.  
If a business needs fast confirmations, then they will switch to Segwit2X or not do Bitcoin business.  If users want to patron businesses which need fast confirmations, they will switch to Segwit2X or not do Bitcoin business.
Not all will switch, but enough will switch to make the fork very contentious.

I hate to break this to you, but the majority of the world does not care about censorship resistance.  Look at the most popular things online and off. They all have censorship in one capacity or another, even when there are uncensored alternatives.  Even reddit censors, but here we are.
In no particular order, most people care about (1) Quick (2) Easy (3) Cheap and (4) Reliable.
Maybe you believe that Bitcoin's place is outside the popular demographic, and that might be true. However, that's a much longer discussion.


I disagree that centralized systems will always be more effective than decentralized networks. Bitcoin is currently "more effective" than a wire transfer, which is a centralized system.  If the decentralized network's capacity is able to manage the demand, then it will be effective.


Why do you care if I buy socks with my Bitcoin? That's my choice. Bitcoin is used for whatever purpose chosen by the users. I buy pizza with mine. You apparently use yours as a store of value.  To each our own.
When we artificially increase the fees to prevent Bitcoin from being used for day-to-day transactions, Bitcoin loses functionality. Maybe that specific functionality isn't used by you, but it's an important functionality.  If Bitcoin can't be exchanged for goods or services, then it's hard to argue that it should be used as a store of value either. If a thing cannot be exchanged for anything of value, then can it be a store of the same? Maybe; I don't know.
You say it's brainwashing to think that Bitcoin could be a "fast free" network. I say it's brainwashing to think that Bitcoin should be a "slow exorbitant" network.

That was my first point.  The defined bitcoin rules of consensus use the consensus by miners.  Majority mining hash power is required for a soft or hardfork. The miner's consensus is currently Segwit2X.
If miners decide to hardfork Bitcoin to Segwit2X and stop mining Core's Bitcoin, then we would all be in trouble because difficulty adjustment would take a while before blocks could be mined at a good pace again.
In this case, nodes on Segwit2X would see transactions process quickly, while nodes on Core would see transactions take days, even with extremely high fees paid.

I'm not sure who "you people" are, but I agree that we need a 2+ layer solution. I'm looking forward to LN.
That said, a 2+ layer solution isn't going to solve the problem alone. We need a network capacity increase or it will be slow + expensive to move in/out/between 2nd layer nodes (which will heavily encourage centralization).

True, it is rushed, but who's fault is that? 
It was planned and agreed (by Core and Miners) since the Hong Kong Agreement in Feb 2016. Core never wrote the code. The agreement was broken. The New York Agreement started May 2017.
In all of that time, the 2X could have been written and reviewed. It feels rushed now because it's been nearly two years since it was agreed, and it's only getting attention now that the Miners are threatening a fork.
I wish that Core had kept to their original HK agreement, and 2X would have been done a long time ago with plenty of time for review. But instead, we're rushed.

I haven't read about any issues with Segwit2X; only FUD and what-ifs.
This hard fork will happen. If Core agrees to 2X, it will be much less contentious, and that's a good thing.
If Core refuses, there will be two Bitcoins.  One Bitcoin (the Core's version) will not have enough mining power to confirm transactions.  The other Bitcoin (the Miner's version) will not have a development team, but they will be able to confirm transactions.
Which Bitcoin do you think the ignorant public will choose? The Bitcoin that confirms transactions in a timely manner or the Bitcoin that does not.
As far as I can tell, we have two hopes: 
1. Core agrees to 2X
2. The Miners were bluffing and back down

Thank you. There is a legit problem, and dismissing it as FUD discourages any path to finding a solution.
Yes, we have low fees and fast confirmation times now, but last week, many in this same community were saying these things were not good for Bitcoin.
The issue is an overloaded network caused by SPAM and/or overwhelming demand.
All I know is that I joined Bitcoin five years ago because I saw it as a replacement for the existing money-moving systems, such as Credit Cards and Bank Transfers.  If we can't beat those systems in time and efficiency, then we have nothing to offer for the majority of the world.
We need the issue resolved, even if that means increasing the network capacity to handle the additional load.

Correct. The blocks eventually refill with the same high fees, but we are still able to transact more transactions. 
It's like if you have a popular bus that's full. So, you add a second bus. The second bus eventually fills up too.  You still end up with full busses, but now double the patrons are able to ride them.

It's easy to install a new client. Much easier than waiting days for your transactions to confirm.
With the difficulty as high as it is, there is no quick easy to scab miners. We have to wait for difficulty to drop, or we have to reset the difficulty with a hard fork. Either option will result in extremely long transaction delays that will push a lot of nodes into using segwit2x.
@_date: 2017-08-22 16:12:33


The fork wouldn't be nearly as contentious if Core publically supported it. I don't get why there are not any tangible benefits, when we get faster transactions and lower fees?
The fork will happen. If Core is on the same side as the miners, then the collateral damage will be negligible.
@_date: 2017-08-23 15:08:55
**BCH is Core's little brother,** and he is pretty popular on instagram himself.  BCH used to ride with Core but got bored with the destination choices. So, BCH decided to leverage his own instagram following to finance and start his own roadtrip.
**At first, BCH was stuck without a driver for a while**. He increasingly offered more money to drivers, and finally Miner decided to drive for BCH part-time (at least for now). Their independent relationship is still new, and could get better or go sour at any time.

Sure, but unless we get a large chunk of the %, it won't help. Also, doing this would go against the miners' goal, which is 2X.


By the time Core garnished enough support for the fork, it would be too late. We're talking weeks with transaction times taking days or longer.
Many businesses can't suffer that kind of latency. They would quickly move nodes supported by the miners to get immediate transaction confirmations.
At the end, we would have two Bitcoins with a lot of support on both sides and no replay protection. Bitcoin value and public trust would plummet. People would start moving to alternatives and find LTC or ETH happy to accept them.
Core and the miners are playing a dangerous game of chicken right now.

She made fun of me in her passive-aggressive ways. I even bought her 0.02 BTC for her birthday in June last year. That $50 gift is still worth $120 today, but she still likes to joke about all the money she lost by not selling when it was worth nearly $380.
But long before that, I told her she should put a few dollars aside, nothing major, and just forget about it.  "Nah, it's already $1000. Let me know when it goes back down; I don't want to buy at the top." Same thing at $2500 and so on all the way up to $19k.
Now that it's way down, I tell her about how she wanted to buy in low, and this is her chance. "You're joking, right? Bitcoin is crashing. I don't want to buy something that's worthless."

This is also a part of the free market.  Most of the bitcoin users (and miners) likely don't understand programming well enough to determine if a change is beneficial.  As a result, they have to trust (or not trust) people based on experience.
If a set of developers don't have miner trust, then I can't blame those miners for voting against those developers.
It would be like if offered a system to improve bitcoin efficiency and adaptation.  He could very well be honestly trying to help, but his reputation would preclude many from trusting him.
Also, it doesn't help that Segwit is a requirement for Lightning Network, which some people feel will hurt bitcoin users who don't use LN.

From what I've read others say though, they trusted the developers until the devs seemed to have a conflict of interest. I'm sure you know that of those who are upset, many of them began to be upset when it was decided the blocksize wouldn't be increased to 2mb. Some people believe this limit was kept because of that conflict of interest.

Coinbase was approved by the SEC for trading the crypto currencies that they do trade. 
The SEC considers some cryptocurrencies to be securities (mostly some ETH tokens). BTC/LTC/ETH are not considered securities and exchanges which only trade these are considered exempt.
So, Coinbase and Gemini are exempt from SEC registration (I think they're trying to register though).
EtherDelta was exchanging a lot of "securities." They didn't even seek approval from the SEC, probably because they knew it wouldn't be approved.

Shit like that. It serves no purpose.
I don't know what will happen with the Segwit2X fork, but you're delusional if you dismiss the proponents as morons. They have a significant following and backing. When they fork, it will be felt. If the miners follow and they execute it as they say, it can be bad for the Core version. They might not follow though, and if they follow, they might still mine the Core version, and if they don't mine the Core version, maybe every node in the world (or nearly all nodes) will reject them. That's your current hope, and that's all it is -- a hope.
If the fork is successful in gaining any significant following, it will create two bitcoins, and that will cause public confusion and uncertainty. It won't be a fun ride.
This is what it's like because our community is so polarized and untrusting.  We don't negotiate or compromise. When we do make agreements, like the HKA and NYA, they're often broken.
We're arguing over bullshit details. Bitcoin is more like a religion now arguing over which interpretation is most correct.

The bitcoin network can't be stolen. It is always controlled by the largest following, as designed. If Segwit2X successfully takes control of Bitcoin, it would not be theft. It would be a change in control -- sort of like when stockholders replace a CEO; the ownership doesn't change, only the direction of the company.
Bitcoin is working as planned. It always will, even if that plan requires a change in those in charge.
You site bitcoin cash as an example of failed coupe, but they never tried to be bitcoin. They added replay protection and didn't have the backing of the miners. This segwit 2x thing is a whole different animal.
I hope you're right, and the takeover fails. But, as my grandpa always said, hope for the best, but plan for the worst.

You're assuming that the majority of the miners are in on the intent to seize bitcoin from Core, but that's not true.  If it were true, they would have done the hard fork without warning and without Segwit.
No, just as stated in the HKA, the miners agreed to Segwit if they got 2x. Bitcoin got Segwit but no 2x, and this is the response.
I've little doubt that a party is manipulating the miners in order to subvert Bitcoin (and core), but if we compromise to give 2x, then that party loses all power of subversion. Bitcoin wins.
If the hard fork succeeds, Bitcoin will lose. The miners do not want that. They have more to lose than most of us.

* We'll need miners on our side. If you can mine, make sure to keep your client updated to the latest core version.  If you have influence over someone who mines, then do your best to get them to do the same.
* We'll need companies on our side. If you patron a company supporting s2x (such as Coinbase, Purse, and ShapeShift), then contact them to let them know where you stand. ([list of companies](
* Alternatively, contact members of Core and try to get them to come to an agreement with S2X miners. I know this isn't a popular choice, but sometimes we need to negotiate with terrorists.

The "get your coins off coinbase" mantra mostly comes back to the trustless principle of Bitcoin. This trustless principle is that you shouldn't trust anyone, especially not the government, so the idea is to keep your keys yourself rather than in an exchange or online wallet. If you subscribe to this principle, it also extends to ETH and LTC.
Coinbase hasn't yet given any red flags to not trust them though, so it's up to you. Some people trust Coinbase more than they trust themselves (to not lose the keys).
The other reason you may want to "get your coins off coinbase" is if you plan on selling the forked coins. For this coming fork, Coinbase has announced they will give you the forked coins within four hours of the fork.  In previous forks, they weren't as clear or fast, so if you wanted your Bitcoin Cash to sell ASAP, you had to get your coins off Coinbase prior to the fork, and then after the fork, you could move them back, if you so desired.
Does that help clear it up?
As for a hostile takeover by banks, it's not much of a concern yet, but each side of the recent fork is painting the other as ultimate evil. The good thing about Bitcoin is that if ever a malicious body controlled Bitcoin, the community would just fork to a new Bitcoin that wasn't controlled by the body. So far, it seems (to me, anyway) that each side is actually trying to help Bitcoin; they just have different ideals about how that should be done.
tl;dr: Go grab a pint and wait for it all to blow over.

Yes, it's more risky because of the asset, but also because of the contract.
Let's say a group believes that s2x has enough consensus to survive the fork, but that group also believes there is a high chance that core and s2x will come to a compromise beforehand (and therefore the fork will be cancelled or postponed).
This group's consensus will not be represented accurately by the market rate of BT1 vs BT2.

If you're running the version from [bitcoin core]( (most likely), then you're on the core chain.

Most companies won't even recognize a mistake until it's called out. Once called out, the company can either fix the mistake or not fix the mistake.

It's like if we were racing our cars for titles. Rules of this race are: If you win, you get my car. If I win, i get your car. If the race gets cancelled, you get my car. If the race gets postponed, you get my car. If we decide to connect our cars together and race as a team, you get my car.
Also, the race gets cancelled if we can come to an agreement.
Now, people buy futures in our cars. If you compare the market value of those futures, you won't get the sentiment for who would win the race. You get the sentiment for who will still have a car.
The market rate of these shares doesn't match sentiment of s2x vs core. It matches sentiment of s2x vs (core, delay, cancel, negotiated agreement).

The difficulty adjustment will take a very long time. Until difficulty adjusts, we will have ~4 hour blocks instead of 10 minute blocks.  The mempool will fill fast, and transactions will take weeks to confirm.
Difficulty adjustment happens every 2016 blocks. This normally takes two weeks, but after losing 95% of hashrate, it will take about 40 weeks for the first difficulty adjustment.
During that 40 weeks, Bitcoin will lose its market share and plummet in value because it's worthless if it can't confirm transactions. People will go to competing currencies.
After the 40 weeks is over and difficulty drops, Bitcoin may still not be profitable to mine because of the new extremely low value. Worse, the old Miners can just mine Bitcoin again for a few days and cause the difficulty to spike right back up to where it was 40 weeks ago.
No. The miners can't be so easily replaced.

I'm not a s2x advocate at all, but minimizing the situation doesn't help the cause.
* Miners didn't try to block LN. You might argue that they tried to block SegWit, but SegWit isn't required for LN.
* Hashrate voting for SF is written into the Bitcoin code. Until that changes, voting by hashrate still matters.
* It very much matters if S2X has 95% hashrate support. If that hashrate drops to zero, Bitcoin will not be confirming transactions for weeks, and businesses (followed by users) will drop support or move support to a competing coin.

The "new miners" don't have the hash power. Everyone who has the hardware to mine profitably does so.
When 95% of the miners leave, the 5% who remain will not be able to mine at a sufficient rate.  The "new miners" won't even match 1% of the hash rate. They just don't have the hardware to do it.

Yes, but BT2 has more ways to expire worthless than does BT1.
BT1 is worthless if:
* BT2 is the only viable chain
* BT1 has any technical issues, subject to Bitfinex discretion
* BT1 is "less compatible" with BTC (originating chain) than BT2 (although not possible because if BT2 is compatible with BTC, then it's worthless)
BT2 is worthless if:
* BT1 is the only viable chain
* BT2 has any technical issues, subject to Bitfinex discretion
* BT2 is "less compatible" with BTC (originating chain) than BT1
* BT2 is still compatible with BTC (originating chain) after forking
* BT2 fork is cancelled
* BT2 fork doesn't occur by Dec 31, 2017
Those last three (or four) points are leveraged against BT2 but not BT1.  I'm not saying if it's fair or not. I'm just saying that this difference skews the market in favor of BT1.

If there is no fork, then there is no "recombine" because they never separated. You are just trading 1 of each future for the equivalent BTC, which was the price before the fork, and since there was no fork, it's still the same price.

Not so. It's only equivalent for those who have an equal amount of corecoin and 2xcoin. The policy benefits those who have more corecoin than 2xcoin, so the price of corecoin enjoys a premium over 2xcoin.

1. The BTC price is just slightly about the low this year, set to about $5900 in February.
2. The point marked on your graph is just after a significant drop and then rally. We didn't have that happen recently.
3. The price is holding a bearish flag pattern, just like in the graph around my mark.
4. If the BTC price breaks the $5900 support, it will fall fast with little support until around $4600.

That's a matter of viewpoint, I guess.
You can look at it two ways.  
* If the fork never happens, then s2x coin is (still) the same as bitcoin.
* If the fork never happens, then s2x coin is worthless.
I'm not arguing which is fair. I'm just pointing out that using the second interpretation will skew the market in favor of the core-coin future.
If we were to instead use the first interpretation, then we would allow users to recombine 1 s2x coin + 1 core coin to get 1 btc.

If s2x and core come to an agreement or postponement, then s2x future is worthless. The btc-core future doesn't have the same risk.
Fair, maybe, but it's not balanced (ie an accurate depiction of market preference).
A more accurate depiction would deem them both worthless on failure-to-fork, and require them to be swapped back into btc if they want to withdraw any (one s2x and one btc-core future).

Right. We hope that most of the 95% stay, but if they don't, Bitcoin is in trouble. Even with new miners mining at a loss, we won't come anywhere near the required hashrate to confirm blocks in a timely manner.  People just don't have the hardware. 
Remember that the miners quitting represent mining farms where each rig uses ASIC hardware specifically engineered to mine bitcoin. They've invested millions of dollars and years of work to be able to do it. The users who will step in to help will be using their computer's GPUs. There is no comparison. All of those home users combined won't even make up 1% of the hashrate lost (until the difficulty adjusts in 40 weeks).
I'm hoping the miners stay, but if they can come to an agreement with core, then we won't have to chance it. All they want is 2mb blocks. It's certainly a reasonable request.

@_date: 2017-10-17 19:40:05
It's difficult to say, but the mempool isn't processed like a queue. The transactions are not confirmed in chronological order.
So, you send $5 to your new wallet, and then send that same $5 to another wallet (without waiting for confirmations).  The second transaction may process first (and fail).  
I don't think the network would propagate the second transaction at all, though, because the address had insufficient funds until the first transaction confirmed.

No. I'm saying that it takes more than "a backroom deal between CEOs" to change the protocol.  
If that is all it took, then you would not be able to "guard against" it. It would have happened without warning or discussion, and neither users nor developers would have had any authority or choice or ability to guard against it.
Since we are having this conversation, that means the change is not entirely in the control of backroom CEO deals. There are users and developers and miners who all have input on the decision, as well as businesses.
@_date: 2017-10-05 17:18:33
Remember, we recently did a soft fork using a similar threat with UASF and called ourselves heros. The miners aren't that much different.
They aren't asking to breach the 21m cap.  They are asking for 2mb blocks.  It's not an unreasonable request.
Besides, Core agreed to the 2mb blocks in the HKA some 20 months ago. It was promised to be implemented July 2017 but the promise was broken. I can see why the miners are upset.
@_date: 2017-10-05 14:35:31
If the miners burn, the users will too. 
@_date: 2017-10-06 11:56:12
I didn't get into that level of detail in the OP, but I'm glad someone is paying attention!
The HKA specifically says 2mb of non-witness data with a cap of 4mb. To do this, we can change the weight of non-witness data from 4 to 2, but again, it's a negotiation. Either is acceptable to me, but I'm not core or s2x.
I agree that a hard fork should be a heavily-weighed decision. The problem we face right now is that if the miners quit as they say, the Bitcoin will be hurt, a lot. I'm just trying to avoid that from happening.
Your plane analogy is good, and as you point out there are engineering considerations before increasing weight, but the weight is still increased when it's an overall benefit. Imagine if we only had small private jets for commercial flight. Those would be expensive, I'm sure, and it would be very difficult controlling the traffic of so many small planes, which would increase delays and expense even more.
I'm excited for all the improvements in the pipeline. I think the reason some aren't looking forward to LN is that they feel that it will centralize a lot of bitcoin into a small number of LN nodes. Some also feel that this centralization is the goal of some core devs, specifically those who are employed by Blockstream. I don't think that, but some people do, and those people are worried about the long term consequence of LN.

You're missing an important fact: **Bitcoin can't confirm transactions without hash power.**
You can have 100% of all the non-mining nodes, but that won't matter at all if there isn't any hash power to mine and confirm the blocks.
Remember BCH? Transactions took days/weeks to confirm because they didn't have enough hash power, and if it wasn't for the emergency difficulty adjustment (EDA), it would have taken even longer.
As is, Bitcoin needs both miners and users.  It is worthless without both.
With Segwit 2x approaching, we have two hopes: (1) Core and S2X make a deal and avert the hard fork. (2) The miners who pledged S2X back down and keep mining Bitcoin Core.
If these two hopes fail, then Bitcoin (Core version), stops confirming transactions overnight.  Then, the only thing keeping S2X from becoming "Bitcoin" are the nodes/users. When the users are notified that they'll have instant confirmations simply by "upgrading" to S2X, the vast majority of them will probably do it.  Game over.
To be real, the miners have a lot to lose from this going south -- probably more than most of us.  
They've been trying to get Core to agree to 2MB transactions just to avert the HF. So, we hope together that they find an agreement or the S2X miners back down.

Entrapment is against the rules for a reason.
If you offer to buy sex from an undercover officer, that's prostitution.  If the officer offers to sell you sex, and you agree, that's entrapment because the police induced you to commit a crime that you were unlikely to commit otherwise.
Imagine some beautiful woman (or whatever you prefer) walks up to you and offers to give you $1 million to sleep with her. You (for the sake of this example) agree, and then get arrested for prostitution.  In cases like this, it's best to secure a lawyer and argue entrapment.

I understand them. I'm saying the rules set out are leveraged in favor of BT1, so the exchange rate doesn't represent sentiment of the actual fork.
If one person has 100 BT1 and another has 100 BT2 when the fork cancels, the latter will translate into 100 BTC while the former translates into zero. This happens if the fork cancels or delays past year's end -- even though the two never forked and therefore are the still same block chain.
BT1 has the risk of failure of its block chain. BT2 has the risk of failure, consensus, delay, and cancellation of its fork.

I know hindsight is 20/20, but if you're doing anything questionable in terms of Coinbase TOS, you really shouldn't be using their wallet.  Actually, you probably should do that even if you're not doing anything questionable.

You're confusing hashrate and difficulty.  Difficulty is based on hashrate, but it's not adjusted for 2016 blocks.
So, the hashrate drops when miners leave, but difficulty stays the same for 2016 blocks. It takes 3+ hours to mine a block at the current difficulty and only 5% of the current hashrate.
2016 blocks @ 3+ hours is a very long time before the next difficulty adjustment. Until that happens, new miners will not be profitable whatsoever.

Even if Coinbase switches all of their full nodes to BIP101, they can still also use traditional Bitcoin.  Even if not, the lack of using Bitcoins doesn't ban other companies' link submissions from Some examples are CNBC, imgur, youtube, bloomberg, twitter, and facebook, who I've seen on this sub several times.  Are we now banning links to companies who do not use bitcoins?
So, I guess I don't understand why you are considering banning them?  They aren't promoting BIP101 in the sub, which is against the sub rules.  Is the rule that we can't promote BIP101 anywhere, even outside this sub?  If so, I would only ask that you please update the guidelines to properly reflect this intention prior to banning anyone for the offense.  
I only ask this so that it's clear what the rules are.  Personally, I hadn't realized that using BIP101 for my own business or promoting the use of it within my own personal circles would ban me from this sub. Not that I would ever do such a travesty, of course.
Thank you, for your expedient clarification of the rules.  We all appreciate your hard work defending this sub from non-bitcoin users.

What the GAO cannot examine are the regular meeting minutes and reasoning for policy decisions and member to member communications. Things like that.
The "Audit the Fed" will remove these GAO limitations. The concern is that with having very detailed communications and meeting discussions, etc, the FED can (and will) face political pressure, and the political pressure will affect the FED's decisions.

You're still assuming that no one will use the original Bitcoin. This is a bad assumption. Just as you mention when your neighbor still uses the original Bitcoin, you can't control what your neighbors do, and half of your neighbors will still use the original Bitcoin.


At least you admit that you were wrong when you said they have no power.  This power was given to them intentionally by Satoshi though.  It wasn't give to them by you, nor was it accidentally.
By giving the power to those who have the most to lose, Satoshi ensured that Bitcoin wasn't changed at the whim of those who would sooner see it destroyed than miss out on a feature request.


That's the whole point.  There is reason to worry, but you're not worried. If you're supporting Bitcoin, and your neighbor is supporting Bitcoin, but these are not the same Bitcoin, then it causes issues.

Oh, I understand game theory, but I also understand business.
The risk seemed to be greatest for the miners, but possibly not. The miners could easily put in a short to hedge risks against a price drop.  Actually, they could still do it, as a fuck-you to the community which threatened them. Yes, we can all do that, but that's why I said the hodlers would lose, as they are the least likely to put in a short against BTC.
You misunderstand my point, if you think I'm worried about short-term fluctuations in price.  No, as I said, I'm worried that (1) there would be two distinct Bitcoins causing great confusion, and (2) Public confidence would be gone.
With competing currencies ready and willing to fill the gap, Bitcoin might never recover from a contentious split which results in two active currencies. Yes, we've recovered from a lot, but that does not mean we always will.


Ironically, if the miners had your same attitude, they would have withstood the BIP148 threat, and suffered short term losses for their own greater gain.

If you're worried about this, and that's understandable, just move the BTC into a new address after the hard fork and before you touch the BCC.
1. Ensure you have access to your private keys, and make a copy if needed.
2. Wait until after the August 1 hard fork.
3. Move your BTC into a new address. This will change the private key for your BTC only. 
4. You can now control your BCC with the original private key, but that private key will not be able to affect your BTC.

Useless? I would beg to disagree. The fact that coal companies can't pay their employees in [company script]( is a good example.  You would think employees would just move and find new jobs instead of accepting script, but as we saw, some people can't afford or aren't educated enough to do it, so the company took advantage.  Regulation was needed to stop it because the free market did not force the companies to regulate.
Or how about when gasoline companies were putting lead in gasoline? It was much more profitable, and all (or the majority) of gas providers were doing it.  The companies spread disinformation to confuse the general population about it.  
The lead burned into the atmosphere, spread around the world, got into the waters, got into everything. The lead/blood levels in food, water, children, and adults skyrocketed. Lead leads to retardation and sterility, and it couldn't be avoided because it wasn't just on the food, it was in it.  
Had they not been stopped by the government, it may have led to the extinction of the human species.  Again, the free market wasn't able to stop it because the free market was being distracted and confused by oil company marketing.
We both agree that regulation is needed, but I don't know a regulation body besides the government that is able to force a company to do the right thing despite high profits.
Maybe we can have approved regulation agencies, but then their own profits are tied to the satisfaction of the companies they're regulating, so I'm not sure how that will work long term.  Even if we do have a variety of regulation companies, someone still has to force companies to use them; otherwise, it's in their best interest to cut every corner that doesn't attract the attention of the majority of consumers -- even if it's hurting them unknowingly.
I'm open to suggestions?  The cost is to high to just shut down regulation and hope the market corrects.  Look at other countries where there aren't regulations -- it's a mess.  Did China's free market correct the overabundant levels of pollution?  No, the government had to step in.
That's another note.  Especially when the consumers aren't in the area that's being harmed or the harm is long term, the market doesn't adjust to penalize abusive businesses.  Like China selling cheap products around the world while shitting in their own neighborhood. You think most Joes in Kansas care if the manufacturer pays super cheap wages or pollutes to the point where the neighborhood can't breathe?  Nope, not usually.

You're the one who compared it to evolution; that's why I brought that up. It wasn't my straw man.


It's not just our brains -- it's a necessity of survival.  We need someone to trust because we can't do everything ourselves.
I'm not a chemist; I don't know how to test for poisons.  If the industry wasn't regulated to prevent poisons in our food, I would have to test it myself.  That means I would have to buy a tool to test my food each time I buy it, before eating it.  In buying that tool, I have to trust the manufacturer of that tool that the tool actually works.  Well, maybe the manufacturer has an independent 3rd party test his tools that I use to test my food for poisons, but then still, I have to trust that independent 3rd party -- or I have to wait to see if people die and then avoid eating from that manufacturer.  Of course, this means I have to trust the news to report these deaths... It could go on and on.  We are an interconnected society, not just a free-for-all evolutionary creature.
And this is just a simple example of food poisoning; it gets much more complicated when we're dealing with long term and inconspicuous issues like pollution in foreign countries.
When people don't see the problem or don't care, then the free market doesn't care.
I brought up China before -- they certainly have regulation, but their regulation is much less stringent than ours in the U.S, and [you see how it's panning out for them.](
The businesses are free to pollute because their customers don't have to see or smell the pollution.  Customers don't see the pollution, so they don't care.  Customers in good areas get cheap products, but in other areas, where people see the problem but aren't customers, they suffer.

The fees are scaled. They don't use 1.49% until amounts over $200.
I did some testing to find the actual breakpoints.
Coinbase fee scale:
Min | Max | Fee
$1 | $10 | $0.99
$11 |$25 | $1.49
$26 | $50 | $1.99
$51 | $200 | $2.99
$201 | and up | 1.49%
From $26-$50, the fee is set at $1.99.  I imagine they are trying to deposit amounts between those numbers.
Edit: It looks like this is a new fee structure. I checked my old orders, and they are a flat 1.49% fee. Automatic deposits may keep their existing fee base from when set up.

Yes, and it comes on the back of a lot of suffering, many species going extinct, and millions of years.  For example, rape is common in animal species because it's successful at propagating an animal's genes.  Harming competitors over territories and mate is common as well.
When you say to leave the regulation to the free market, what do you mean?  Are you saying, for example, that if people knew the government would allow poisons to be put in food, they would do more to test their own food?  And then those people would stop buying the poisoned food, so that manufacturer would make more efforts to provide clean food.

I think we have a few points where we're misunderstanding one another.


No, my point was the lead in the food and air and water.  In the quantities it would need to make your children sterile, it would be tasteless and odorless.  People wouldn't know there was a problem until it was too late.  Imagine this -- you find out that most people are now sterile. Children and even some adults are becoming retarded.  Some (read one) scientist, C. C. Patterson, blames it on lead in gasoline, but other scientists (all under the gasoline employ) insists it's just natural to have a lot of lead everywhere.  Even if you believe Patterson, you have no way to avoid the lead at this point, it takes a specially manufactured clean room just to get away from the lead.  Food from your own garden is poisoned with lead.  The water you drink is poisoned with lead.  You have to eat -- you have to drink -- even though you think you might be dying from lead poisoning.  A lot of people would have died, and children would not have been conceived.


My point is that the "Market Forces" and "Invisible Hand" can't work unless there is complete awareness and transparency.  If you don't know a company is polluting, how do you avoid buying from them?  And the farther you are from the issue, the less you'll know or care. A company X outsources their toxic waste disposal to another company Y who dumps it in a lake in India.  I might not even know it was my company who hired that other company.  I can say, "I've never done business with company Y." but maybe I have and just don't realize it. Do you know all the companies that do business with all the companies you do business with?
How can the free market adjust when the free market is ignorant of the situation? You can't expect everyone to know everything.
Look, the U.S. hasn't always had regulations.  The regulations came about because people were getting hurt or dying or getting deceived other bad stuff was happening.  The laws didn't happen overnight, there was time for the invisible hand to fix the problems -- it didn't.  It doesn't.

The Ben Franklin quote is always taken out of context.  It is actually, "Those who would give up essential Liberty, to purchase a little temporary Safety, deserve neither Liberty nor Safety."
This was written by Ben Franklin in response to William Penn's offer that the colonists give up their "Liberty" to tax the Penn estate in exchange for Penn funding defense against the French and Native American attacks (i.e. temporary safety).
So, when Ben Franklin said this, **he meant it literally**.  He was opposed to giving up the state's Liberty of taxing the Penn estate in exchange for the temporary safety offered by the Penn family.

This reminds me of all the graphs posted right after the last big crash.  The sub was filled with pattern-matching speculation.
Still, I hope this time, you're right.

I read both subs.  I have to say when first popularized, it was a shithole of circlejerk complaints about theymos and but it's been getting better.
The selective censorship does bother me though.  I've seen good posts about coinbase get pulled, while complaints about coinbase are allowed.  I've seen posts about USD getting seized are allowed, but posts discussing increasing bitcoin blocksize get pulled.
I get it. He doesn't want a blocksize increase, and he does what he wants to prevent discussion along those lines.  He controls the sub, and that's his freedom.
However, reddit admins have control over the sub as well, and it's their freedom to remove mods, which they have done on other occasions.
That said, I've never seen the admins pull mods for censorship, so I don't think theymos is going anywhere.

This kind of thinking is keeps us from staying vigilant.  While it might not be possible to subvert "the idea and mechanics" of a blockchain, all they need to do is subvert Bitcoin. Bitcoin is controlled by the community and the community is heavily influenced by a handful of people.
If you get those people on your payroll and lead bitcoin down a self-destructive path, then bitcoin will self-destruct.  By the time the community realizes what happened, the bitcoin threat would be neutralized.  Other alt-coins would attempt to take Bitcoin's place, but many of them, too, would be controlled by the same banks.  It would take a very long time just to regain the position that Bitcoin is in right now.
So, while the idea and mechanics of a blockchain are not easily subverted, we should still keep our eyes out for those who could take down Bitcoin itself.

No, it doesn't work that way.  I'll give you an example.
So, Apple is going to announce record losses.  Only a handful of people at the office know this, and decide to cash out their stocks before the announcement.  Outsiders don't know about the news yet, so the shares sell at a good price.
The announcement is made, and even though some of the stock value has already been lost, the stock has much more room to drop as it is over priced still, according to analysts.  People sell, and the stock drops.  
Those with the inside knowledge were able to keep a good portion of their investment by selling prior to the announcement.
Yes, insider trading does work -- that's why the law was made in the first place.

That would require you locked you BTC at viabtc until August 1st, and it requires that you locked you BCC at viabtc for an indefinite period of time.
If you're okay with doing that, then be my guest.

The space heaters would be paid for by the profits from the short sales.


The problem is when one doesn't get completely annihilated, which can happen in the case of BIP148.


Obviously not true, or we wouldn't have needed to force their hand. If they had no power, they would have just done as instructed when instructed.


Maybe you ignore the blocks.  Maybe your neighbor does not.  Some will ignore A; some will ignore B; some will not ignore either, and the majority of people don't know wtf is happening.  That's what happens when there is a contentious fork. 
It hurts Bitcoin, and with competition, it might not recover.  You might hope/assume that your version of Bitcoin becomes overwhelmingly more popular, but consider if you're wrong.  Bitcoin is crippled because the miners would not give into your threatening demands to implement a feature you like.

How about this, add one month to each node, starting with the ones expiring soonest. Fund each to one year before starting a new node.  So, 18 months of funding would give you 1 node for a year and then start a new one for 6 months. Another 3 month donation would add 3 months to the second node.

In ~10 years, those kids will be adults. They may even have jobs and influence. 
If they're here, it's probably because they want to learn about bitcoins or they're excited. I don't see why they're not welcome.

You forget, however, when the information is in the hands of a few powerful, then that information isn't decentralized.  In terms of large businesses, the information will always be in the hands of few before many.
The laws that force the information to be shared prior to acting on that information -- that's forcing decentralization of the information.

When speaking of stability in currencies, the monthly timeframe is rarely invoked.
Bitcoins are still in the same arena as penny stocks. Of course they can 100x their value in a year, but that is not stable. Bitcoins are for those willing to lose the money they put in. 
In twenty years, it may be something different, but until then, don't try comparing it to currencies backed by enormous GDP's.  You're comparing apples and bananas, my friend.
