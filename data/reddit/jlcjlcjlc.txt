Bro, do you even electrum? Do you even ledger? Not sure why you posted this on this thread, but currency should be transferred immediately to a secure wallet of your choice.

Bitcoin has made me more than my salary + bonus this year. I have a well paid tech job. It is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:25:06
Tru Dat. Not ready to exit yet though... 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:18:31
Lol. Yes. Capital gains... Lame.

I think it does. The axis are weird. My brain wants them switched.

Hodl. It has a major future. My opinion : this isn't a stock. It is a network. Like Facebook or Google. downs are insignificant in the larger trend. It will grow massively rapidly and then plateau but not drop. At least drop in a massive way. It is still growing. There is an huge amount of adoption ahead of us.

I am not on the "spend" band wagon. I say hodl. Economic principles do not support a spend approach. For a currency with a limited supply, you want to keep velocity low. Otherwise, value is diminished. Bitcoin has value without it being used as a daily spender. I don't like the comparison to gold, but it is the easiest thing to liken it to.

I don't quite understand how to read the depth chart. My brain thinks it does, but I don't think it do. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 03:05:56
I got super lucky. Bought bch at 600, sold at 1300, moved all profits into btc during btc dip. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:19:26
Agreed. We have many more painful dips until that point though. Stay strong and hodl! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:49:47
Amen. Don't buy a fucking brand new car. 
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:01:28
Lol. No. I don't. Only what I believe. As I said, this is my "opinion" on a future outcome. No one could possibly know what they are talking about when discussing future outcomes.
I have a bachelors in economics. I know how to analyze sources for credibility. I read those sources for insights on the financial role of bitcoin and the technical underpinnings.
I am aggressively invested in bitcoin and a few other cryptos, but not over - invested. If it fails entirely tomorrow, I won't be hurting.
That being said, I am optimistic, and I believe in the growth.
Hodl.

What do you use to make your decisions? 
@_date: 2017-11-18 19:59:42
Here is all you need to know :
@_date: 2017-09-12 13:19:12
I think, for the time being, most people are only moving bitcoin as part of a trading strategy (which for many is holding it). With the purchasing power of btc on the rise, it doesn't make sense to pay for things with it.
Earn dollars, or whatever your local currency is, and buy BTC. That way, you don't have to wait to enter the market.

The way I see it, that I haven't seen explained yet here, is that block chain itself will revolutionize the internet and all computer/phone applications. The decentralization, smart contracts, security all add up to be the direction of the future. Bitcoin, and other cryptos, are just one aspect of a blockchain. A tokenization of a blockchain. To execute financial transactions on the future internet or any future application built on blockchain, you will need to use the token that goes along with the blockchain your internet or application is on. Bitcoin and ethereum and a few others will be those tokens (or maybe some crypto yet to be invented). There will be the ability to use multiple different crypto currencies within one blockchain, and this means there will be exchange rates and there will be different reasons to use different cryptos. Eth will be great for complex financial exchanges (stocks, loans, etc). Btc will be a store of value. You might need to move assets between different cryptos depending on the action you are taking.
In short, the world will be built on blockchain in the future because of the benefits inherent in blockchain. In order to participate in that world, you will need to hold crypto in some form or another because that will be the vehicle for financial transactions.
We aren't there yet because there has not been enough development and adoption of blockchain apps and internet. The growth and movement towards a blockchain world is what will build the value of cryptocurrencies and that value will stabilize for bitcoin and others, but there will always be new and up coming currencies, just like there are in today's world. The yuan  gains purchasing power, the euro gains purchasing power, it is just that our current currency world is highly matured and the most recent major currency launch was the euro. 
Based on my limited understanding at the moment (I am always learning new stuff that changes that opinion), a key indicator to watch to understand future crypto value and practicality are companies like blockstack and others that are building a blockchain based internet and providing a platform for app dev on that chain (I think they are using btc as the token for now).

You can always afford it, maybe just not as much as you would like.

It will happen some day. But btc isn't really designed for that. Other cryptos will end up being the daily spenders. Eth, monero, and others. Btc, because of the design, will always, most likely, be a store of value. IMO
who knows what new development will happen though???

What he/she said ^^ Let me know if you need help setting up a wallet. It can be intimidating, but it isn't really that hard. 
@_date: 2017-10-26 02:51:28
Do this
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:18:49
I know there are whole threads where people passionately discuss whether to spend using bitcoin to support adoption of the tech or to hodl.   The fact is, if you spend bitcoin right now, you are losing money.  It is on a growth trajectory, and I believe the trajectory is not driven by how many people spend it.  It is based on growth and prevalence of other blockchain tech and the demand generated by other investors. ICOs are also a major factor currently in creating demand for crypto (some legit and some not legit).

Mobile wallets like electrum and coinomi are reasonably secure. They all have their downsides. Just don't leave your coin in the exchanges. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 23:20:26
Dishodl is my new favorite verb
@_date: 2017-10-02 19:08:33

@_date: 2017-10-18 14:41:48
Don't just hodl, though. Invest! 
@_date: 2017-10-20 14:23:12
But some coin in coinbase. Transfer it to a wallet. Hodl.  Direct message me if you want more details
