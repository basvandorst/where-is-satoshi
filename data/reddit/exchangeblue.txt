There is no correlation . 99% of the reddit comments are meaningless, therefore can’t be weighted as price trigger of any kind.

You call trading a scheme? lol You must be very educated, my friend :) Bitcoin is an asset, which makes it an investment vehicle for those who view it as such. The are others, who treat bitcoin purely as piece of technology. finally there are some of us who see a potential for capital gains even during the bearish market. So, what ever your definition of a bitcoiner is, don't  try to push your opinion onto others...

This is the reason behind Iraq and Syria invasion.. Now russia is on the list, but since bearing arms against Putin isn't an option, they try to choke them with sanctions..

What it was initially meant for and what it grew to become is quite different, don't you think? When the hammer was invented, it was intended purely for driving nails in, but as it became more popular people realized that now you can also hit someone in the head with it..
