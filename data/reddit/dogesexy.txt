There's no crypto war or competition. Our common competitor is the traditional banking system.  
I think both Bitcoin and Dogecoin can profit from each other. One is the leader, the pioneer, starting it all while Dogecoin is a fun project, attracting lots of attention to cryptos in general and making it popular among more people. And thereby also creating attention for Bitcoin.   
I think among Bitcoin, Dogecoin, and a few other serious cryptos like Namecoin or Peercoin, we have a win-win situation here and there's no reason to look down on some community.

and they also have some other crypto coins, like Dogecoin... oh wait, wrong subreddit
@_date: 2014-05-22 09:02:07
thanks for visiting Dogecoin
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:52:42
True, but Ripple is a special case, because one of the main players announced to sell all his coins

A small inflation doesn't necessary need to be bad. I think it's good that Doge differentiate themselves from the others. After all, the whole crypto currency economy is still an experiment. We should be glad to see so many cryptos trying different concepts. Who knows which model will be most successful. Maybe neither Bitcoin nor Doge but an entirely different crypto that learned from the mistakes of the existing ones.  
Here you can read a bit more about some misconceptions on Doge's inflation:

thanks for the tip

I had to laugh. Well done.
I've many Dogecoins and I'd be more than happy if Dogecoins would go up, too. On the other hand, the rate Doge/US$ is pretty stable, and maybe in the long run it's even a good sign when a coin's exchange rate is not just dependent on Bitcoin's rate like it's the case with many alt.coins.
Anyway, enjoy the view on the moon. We'll see you later and bring some hot dogs.

you can buy flower seeds at shibeseeds.com, pay with BTC (or Dogecoin) and make a bee friendly garden at your place.

The production photos looks great! All the best!

good - every square inch is good
@_date: 2015-01-05 12:39:56
agree, and happy cake day
@_date: 2015-01-05 20:35:31
they had a great customer service, sad news
@_date: 2015-05-20 20:52:20
Wow, nice, that's a huge area. I guess shibeseeds mainly addresses smaller customers, so you might discuss a better deal than the usual customer
@_date: 2015-01-29 22:10:35
I think they do a great job to make Bitcoin mainstream. I gets a bit annoying to hear the usual jokes over and over again. Let's support them and hope for the best.

Since when do you care about that?
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:20:58
I do. Domains, donations, stationary, plants,... Guess which alt I used.
@_date: 2017-03-24 16:34:10
Haha. Almost right.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:45:39
Big enough to make many, including you, worried.
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:29:47
PayPal isn't cheap. And I'm not only interested in fast and cheap but ALSO being independent from traditonal finance system.
@_date: 2017-08-18 08:49:54
Most people don't care. They don't know the technical details. They are not interested in politics at all.  
They want a coin that works, has fast and cheap transactions, is more or less independent from banks, and has a promising outlook of its value.
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:02:42










Would that really matter? Isn't Bitcoin still safe enough with much less nodes?
@_date: 2017-04-05 15:34:26
3 weeks ago I purchased a domain name at namecheap. I wanted to pay with Bitcoin through BitPay. Took more than 2 days until it arrived. Guess, Stephan doesn't have his tools ready.
@_date: 2017-04-10 16:53:54


No, I don't want to gamble. But I also don't want to support a concept that unnecessarily spends energy and money. Maybe it would work equally safe with less resources, thus being more efficient. And that's why I asked. 
@_date: 2017-09-05 21:43:44
Sorry for letting you wait. Their history (-&gt;Bitcoinica), the alleged hack, etc. and now the Tether drama. Many threads in crypto related subs like [this one]( make me not trust them at all.
@_date: 2017-09-05 10:10:40
I'm positive we can trust ~~Mt.Gox~~ Bitfinex with this statement.
@_date: 2017-10-06 15:54:11
Interesting to watch but I will never ever put any coins in bitfinex.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:40:43
I hope for everyone who still has money with them, that you're right. I doubt it.

Airbitz.co was recommended to me, haven't tested it yet, though
