Wonderful news. As a huge supporter of MAPS (and Bitcoin, obviously) I am really thrilled about this. Let's see more ibogaine studies!

For what it's worth, has been responding to some threads here on Reddit, and Kraken also published this update on their website  
Too little too late for most people here I think.

This. I can forgive anything when someone stands up and says "sorry, we fucked up. Here's what we're doing to fix it", but this silence is unacceptable.

How about for those of us in Europe? Any lists?

Your gf stole your coins? Did you report her to the police?

I saw one in the airport last week! They have their niche

You need to look into a thing called a "tax letter". It's how megarich people deal with the IRS. It's basically where you hire a tax guru who writes a letter to the IRS that throws them a bone. Apparently they go for it quite often.

RemindMe! 1 year.

Fair point, and I sincerely hope that is the case. My first support request was sent on Monday, and I made contact with jespow here on Reddit on Wednesday. As you can see from his profile, he's been quite active here every day this week

Thanks. That's good to know. If they do get back to me and resolve this issue with a clear explanation, I'll be very happy to come back and update this posting. As I said, I hate to be the guy writing this. :-(
@_date: 2013-12-09 09:32:36
Thank you, this was the most helpful response.
@_date: 2013-12-03 23:52:42
Thank you for this - very informative!

Presumably if they catch the thieves, then the coins can be legitimately returned to their owners, no?
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:25:21
Do you have any details about that? Having only recently gotten into Bitcoin, I'm not fully up to speed.

Sure, technical fuckups can happen; as a techie myself I understand that. What happens after that is what worries me - no support, no response, emails and support request ignored. The jespow guy here on Reddit did respond asking for my public account ID, which I gave him, and then heard nothing back. If there's a technical issue, they need to make paying customers aware of that. We're not talking about a few bucks here, I'm talking about 1000's of dollars.
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:44:43
Thanks for that. I was keeping pretty cool about until I noticed that jespow was replying to other comments here on Reddit - that kind of annoyed me.
Hopefully, I'll have some good news real soon now. :-)

Good point, as a European I'm not really aware of US holidays. And do dot coms close down for holidays and weekends?

You think 5 days isn't enough time to give them? I was trying to login to buy Litecoin at $9. It's now trading at $41 - have a guess how annoyed I am about that huge loss.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:08:04
Nice to put a face on you. You seem like a really decent and smart guy. Best of luck and thanks for the great support here!
@_date: 2013-11-30 12:12:05
I liked it until I got locked out of my account, and after 2 emails to support and even a message here on Reddit to jespow, I've heard nothing back. It's hard to explain how they couldn't even send a simple "we got your message, and we're looking into it" response. Disappointing.
@_date: 2013-12-02 09:34:33
many thanks for the message. I'm relieved to hear from you - as I already mentioned, I only turned to Reddit when I got no response from the official support channel. It's been 7 days since the first of my 2 support requests. Anyway, it'd be great if you can help sort this out. Here's the support ticket 
@_date: 2013-12-01 22:32:02
Their Facebook page 
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:58:51
Thanks. Good to see so many people here keeping an eye on things like this.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:56:56
All has ended well. Support got in touch, and helped me resolve the problem. The delay in responding was put down to "growing pains".
