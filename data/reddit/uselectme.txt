Right, so because your side lost the government is no longer functioning.
Is totally not the US's little pet


What are you basing this on? Im Scandinavian, and I can tell you that the Scandinavian governments are just as corrupt and in the pockets of the big corporations and other special interests as any other.

This seems like just arguing semantics to me. In order for political authority to exist and be possible to exercise, the government needs to have de facto and de jure legitimate control of the territory. Whether you call the land the property or the territory of the government is irrelevant.
The scenario you describe is oversimplified. Sure, if a group of people come together and agree on doing creating a government for themselves, that is not controversial because the way you describe it is that its consensual. The problem of political authority arises as when its not consensual, and when there is an entity which is entitled to coerce people in circumstances in which no other agent is allowed to coerce people, and which people are obliged to obey in circumstances in which they would not be obliged to obey any other agent.

If the government has legitimate political authority, it can do pretty much whatever it wants as political authority is largely content-independent. That includes taxing, conscription, illegalizing abortion or whatever. The question thus becomes does legitimate political authority exist? If yes, how did it come to be?

Bro, do you even EU?

Scandinavian countries have even less means for holding government accountable than the US. I know that they have a  reputation as some kind of Utopian Paradise on Earth but reality simply isn't like that.

Just curious, why support freedom and privacy of correspondence and not freedom and privacy of earning income?

*All* voters *know* that those they vote for will tax them in order to fund the things they like. If what you said was true *no* voter would do this.
