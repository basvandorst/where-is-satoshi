That is a giant negative. I am just barely starting to wrap my head around Bitcoins in general. Mining too complex for me.

It was less generosity and more stupidity, unfortunately.

Well to be fair, I didn't put it in all at once. I transferred small amounts at first and then a couple .5 amounts. It wasn't my misunderstanding of bitcoin that got me in trouble, it was not understanding how the bot works and how it links to the blockchain wallet. I did not realize that the main address that I saw when I logged into blockchain was the same one that the bot uses. And to top it off, there was a flaw in the design of the bot that has since been fixed. What's funny is that I created and was researching an electrum wallet yesterday morning which lead me to dinking around with my wallet later that night.

[Helen DeVoss Children's Hospital in Grand Rapids Michigan.]( They are absolutely amazing. My daughter had brain cancer and we met some of the most amazing doctors, nurses and staff. They don't take donations in bitcoin but they are still worthy of the cause.

Oh man, I was just about to post a similar question. There are over 10 posts on the front page alone about this whole debacle and I am so lost trying to piece it all together.

It may only seem evolutionary because you are looking at it after it has already been invented. 
Do you think if Satoshi never released the white paper that someone else would have created the blockchain?

So how can the average person protect themselves from this looming crash?

For the people who are not reading the article and jumping to conclusions about why he mentions 2 years.
