Here's my story that literally played out last night. I had gotten home from Christmas and opened up my laptop to see the fact that broke into the top 100 of They had crested .01 cent, now several years ago I taught a class in crypto as part of my undergraduate degree, this was just around the time of the DogeCar so I decided to buy some DogeCoin (Approx 50 dollars worth, which at the time was like 1,093,000 doge because the coin had crashed hard) I used it to learn crypto and gave paper wallets to people in my class on the off chance they had intrest. Last night after seeing the thread I change 1 million DogeCoins into .67 BTC. So not free but I turned my 50 bucks into 10,000 basically by hodling by accident.

Church of Satan is veiled atheism. It basically abuses 'freedom of religion laws' in the US to enforce the 'seperation of church and state's deal.
Their the folks with the Bapohomet statue they plop on government land. Just atheists out to make a point.
My dog tags officially read church of Satan though
