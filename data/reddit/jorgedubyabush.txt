Unless the average redditor is a grumpy Libertarian like me, I don't see why they would have any need for it. I still get all tingly when I pay for something with Bitcoin because I know somewhere, somehow, I'm screwing the Man.

That's weird that just because the dentist died the business wouldn't continue accepting Bitcoin. I take it, it was a private practice?
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:30:42
I'm confused. What exactly do they want the government to "help" with? More government spending?

My dentist in San Francisco takes Bitcoin.

Conspiracy theory guy question. What makes you think this isn't just a shake down of banks so the beurocrats, who are also the banks friends, get a piece?

I understand what you're saying, but wouldn't you agree that we can teach people about freedom and liberty through teaching about Bitcoin? Bitcoin should be for everyone, then everyone would understand freedom.

I had 0.7btc in my circle account. Transferred it to my ledger and deleted the app. I'll keep my account open just in case Circle wakes up and pulls their head out of their ass. Bitcoin FTW!!!!

Download BreadWallet. Transfer your btc from Circle to your BreadWallet. 
Like Frogo said, you should not be teaching people to keep their btc with exchanges like Circle. That's how you get Goxed. 
Also, yes your btc should be in your Circle account. If not, those bitches stole it.

If ending the drug war means people that commit victimless crimes, like using drugs, stop going to prison? I'm ok if Bitcoin goes to zero.

I have a ledger nano as well and I did no such thing. I just plugged it into my MacBook Air and the Nano goes to work. Everything is encrypted and there is even a detailed video of how it works on their website. I've had it for a while and have had no problems. I don't know a lot about computers so I am one of those Bitcoin users that just likes that it works and is easy to use.

I'm seriously really dumb with this shit so bare with. Is this hash per block the same thing as the hash rate?
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:18:46
But what does it mean?!
@_date: 2016-09-02 02:42:35
I'm definitely Feeling the Johnson. I've donated with Bitcoin and have also bought some sweet T-shirts off the site too.

I don't know what nsfw is but nobody can hack your nano because it makes you create a 24 word phrase or something crazy long like that. Only you will know that. Also it essentially just shows you a Bitcoin address and your balance. Where it came from and where it went. The nano doesn't reveal your personal information for someone to take a picture of.
@_date: 2016-09-26 05:45:16
Thank you for your explanation. It's much clearer now.
@_date: 2016-09-20 02:42:34
Very misleading title. I freaked out for a second.
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:50:40
Haha. No thanks. I don't feel like being traumatized ;)
Yes, it is absolutely fine to use it for day to day transactions. It might not be the most convient though. You will obviously have to use a computer with a USB port as opposed to using a smartphone. I use it for more like a safe. I put huge amounts of btc on them and keep them off of phones and computers all together.

I'm normal. I make it rain Bitcoin err'day.
@_date: 2016-09-26 02:51:50
Thank you both for the explanation. That makes much more sense. Does this have anything to do with the fact the blocks are being mined at around 8 min right now?
@_date: 2016-10-19 03:10:28
Good to know. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-10-21 06:49:40
I've never thought of it like that. This is really smart. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:19:20
"Seasoned funds".  That's a new one. I thought money was money. 
@_date: 2016-10-10 05:26:46
Great interview. Thanks for sharing.
@_date: 2016-10-16 00:51:20
Who do you bank with, if you don't mind me asking? Are you in the US?
I bank with Wells Fargo and I've never been charged a fee to use my debit card. Ever. No matter how many times I use it. As long as there is money in my account.

Hillary Clinton and her ilk make me sick to my stomach. People need to see this. Thank you for sharing.
