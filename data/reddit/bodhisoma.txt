Imagine this post being read by someone in 2000.

You could just convert all your bitcoin chatter into just shouting "BIKES!" at random points in the day.
I'm not sure that'd help things on the whole but...

I'd never heard of it.  Thanks for bringing it to my attention.

That's ...not even a remotely passable representation of what OP said.

Three second demonstration of the lightning network followed up with a seven minute demonstration of a gambling problem.  Cool.

People stealing $50m don’t go to prison, true, but not for a lack of a crime.
People stealing $50m don’t go to to prison because money sings and $30m fucking yodels.

Uh ...no.  I’m answering the narrow question about what information can and cannot be extracted from past poker hands.  I am not knowledgeable enough about the larger argument to offer insight.
Have you considered decaf?

I don’t think they’re saying analysis of card distribution (or elimination) will yield information about the cards to come in future games.
I think they’re saying if one analyzed how past hands played out, one can perform better as a player in future hands.
Which is, of course, accurate.

This is something like the third post I’ve ever read in this sub, I’m subbed because I bought btc like 2 months ago for shits and giggles, and I just happen to be an ex semi-pro player.
Seriously.  Decaf.  Of just stop being a nervous cunt if the teeth staining puts you off.

If you’re talking about opponent’s actions, yes.  If I see someone open 100% and cbet flops 100% over the last 100 hands, I can calculate my range against theirs.  But that’s an inference about player habits, not card distribution.
This could be extended further by taking the cards remaining minus the cards I hold (or have seen mucked) and applying card elimination to calculate the odds of cards to come.  For example, if someone is opening and cbetting any two, nothing could be eliminated, but if their range is narrower (an extreme example might be opening/cbettng only AA/KK), the remaining deck is far less likely to have these cards.
If that’s what you’re saying, also correct.
But if you’re saying future cards can be better predicted by past experience — without consideration of a player’s range in a given spot — other than accounting for known cards, that’d be incorrect.

Oh.  If see what you’re saying, kinda. 
But the error you’re making — and why I didn’t follow your logic from the start — is because none of what you describe as being learned from observation cannot be learned without observation.
For example, there are four aces in a deck of 52.  The odds of me getting one is therefore 1-in-13.  There are now three aces left in a deck of 51 and therefore the odds of the second card also being an ace are 1-in-17.  For both actions to occur:
(52/4) * (51/3) = 221
So the odds for being dealt pocket aces are 1-in-221.  No need to consider past hands to derive this information. In fact, as you point out, your observation method will yield some degree of error which will asymptotically approach zero as sample size reaches infinity while the deduction method is precise and requires no hand collection or analysis.
The obvious conclusion is that a method which requires more work AND yields less accuracy should never be used.
I can’t think of anything in poker which could be determined by an examination of past hands which couldn’t also be determined *without* an examination of past hands (outside of player tendencies).

Clearly you are not a poker player.

Trying to buy something on Amazon using the Moon plugin, which uses the lightning network.
Super frustrating.

They have not elaborated on which banking institutions are on the backend.

Can’t.  I’m using Mycelium and for some dumb reason the amount of funds it will allow me to send is about 40% of what I have.  By that I mean it shows I have 171.93 but when I click “use all funds,” it auto-populates to 60.47. And I can’t find any way to send the amount in actual bitcoin (as opposed to USD).
Perhaps I should import my wallet into a third client (not BlueWallet), then try using that client to send to the lightning account I set up in BlueWallet?
This is ridiculous...
