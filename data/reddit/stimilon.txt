Double spend that amount to a different wallet. The original transaction shouldn’t confirm and second transaction will.

I don't know for sure, but could it be due to the high volume there is slippage between between price ordered and executed. Theoretically there should only be one bid-ask spread, right?

Same. I am in no way a trader or qualified about technical analysis, but that’s only time I’ve seen these faint spider lines.

The absolute crazy part of this is that Ashley Barr lived in White Rock, British Columbia which is the site of the hit DPR allegedly ordered with redandwhite.

I'd say that chart is interesting in that the volume traded in the hour after the news broke was 10x the usual hourly average. Also, if someone had bought at 6am and sold them between 10 and midnight they'd have an annualized return of 2300%. That's better than loansharking.

No. It was only 30-40 BTC. It still stings a lot when I think of what that would have been worth today.

Every transaction is both a buy and a sell. These are not offers. These are executed trades meaning two parties agreed upon a price.

Really? cool. I thought it was 48 hours.

People remember SETI  I describe it as a similar kind of distributed network analyzing many pieces of mostly useless data in hopes of finding something useful.

Bought first time a month ago and had 5 day lag.  Bought this morning with instant delivery

That's kind of the road I expect to take. Yeah, taxes are kind of a pain, but any profits I make I plan to report which is why I want to have my ducks in a row for when I file next year (assuming my currently unrealized gains are realized by that time and I don't have don't huge offsetting losses between now and dec 31)

Yep. I used Dwolla to get in and out back in May/July 2011. I finally got my MtGox verified today after waiting for 10 days. I just figured it was worth asking in case there was some method I've been missing.

Just put of curiosity, what metro area?
@_date: 2013-01-10 21:59:23
What do you think is happening in the dark pools?

Also, tax rate changes depends on how long you held them. If you hold more than a year then the tax rate is sig less.

Here is a solution that the lead dev for bitcoin, Gavin Anderson, suggested on his blog to defend the 51% attack. 
*Something like "ignore a longer chain orphaning the current best chain if the sum(priorities of transactions included in new chain) is much less than sum(priorities of transactions in the part of the current best chain that would be orphaned)" would mean a 51% attacker would have to have both lots of hashing power AND lots of old, high-priority bitcoins to keep up a transaction-denial-of-service attack. And they'd pretty quickly run out of old, high-priority bitcoins and would be forced to either include other people's transactions or have their chain rejected.*
He also linked to [The Bitcoin wiki]( about it.

okay, not a pro at this, but I DO know better than that.

if you're buying that means someone is selling. 
Every transaction has two parties. (well, unless you were selling a large quantity to yourself in order to manipulate the market and then make money on the knee-jerk reaction of others...but that's a story for another day.)

I was using the two interchangably, yes. I was trying to think how people might exploit this situation and then think about the defenses for each would / should be.

And, if you do have a loss you can use those losses as a carry-over to offset future gains so it is worth tracking.
