Log on to gdax.com with your coinbase info and send it from there, it’s free
@_date: 2018-01-06 05:38:21
Yup also keep in mind buying, selling, trading are free as well using gdax. I think it’s because they already make a fortune with coinbase

It’s coinmarketcap removing the premium prices from Korean exchanges, global average price went down on the website causing weak hands to panic

Which is why you can’t say 15,000 is expensive as well. As long as you treat it as a fundamental investment and you believe it will appreciate in value overtime, then you have nothing to worry about :)

Bitcoin didnt even go up in the news of goldman sachs adding trading desks so why would it even go down with this one
@_date: 2018-09-10 06:24:19
To help you envision a future of crypto, i believe youll see a world using thousands of different coins everyday with dex’ allowing ppl to easily exchange their coins as they need. I believe bitcoin has already earned this spot of adoption in the future but it may not be the most practical medium of exchange because of its scarcity. The future of other coins will determined by the community and ecosystem they create. Youll also see other coins of value such as titles, shares, physical items etc being traded everyday so theres going to be much more than bitcoin in the future. exciting times ahead

You are missing so many factors.. first of all this bubble is much different than the rest.. its a much bigger market now with a higher markercap with altcoins making up 50% of it. Which mean the higher the marketcap, the less volatility the asset will experience. If you were around back in 2012 in crypto, 50% daily swings  was normal behavior for bitcoin, today its a big deal if bitcoin moved even 10% for the day. And today with altcoins making up half of the market, you need to take them into consideration since bitcoin’s previous bubble made up 90% of the market. Thirdly, the bubble that occurred this year is merely just a market getting ahead of reality, nothing fundamentally changed unlike in 2013, many people had their bitcoin hacked from them. Next reason, many things are being implemented in the crypto space behind closed doors.. the crypto bubble popped and now you have all these institutions slowly marching into the space. Lastly, bitcoin halving will occur end of 2019 which will drive the price of btc due to its increase in mining power. Overall, the fundamentals have not changed for crypto and there is so many things happening right now to bring adoption to the space. The market as a whole already experienced a 78% drop while the previous bubble had an 85%. It wouldnt make sense at all if this bubble would drop harder than the previous one

Next episode is about icos lol interesting how that will play out
@_date: 2018-09-10 03:03:28
What bitcoin has is recognition, history and the fact it open the doors for the next wave of innovation. Discovery of bronze started the bronze age, internet started the age of information, and now we have bitcoin which is currently sparking the age of digitalization and decentralization. Since it is the first of its kind, it is slow and ancient compared to the other blockchains currently being built but it what does have over the others is the security proven through the time it had withstand. In the future i believe people will look at bitcoin as digital gold while other cryptocurrencies will be used for day to day use as their dapps and communities grow.

Mike novogratz predicted 20k btc and $500 eth end of 2017 in November, i didnt believe it but it happened

Hacked for 800btc from a tiny unknown exchange in the middle of nowhere canada? That would be stupid if thats the reason for the drop

Because it’s a way for the media and manipulators to fuck with the market
@_date: 2018-10-12 01:09:06
Whether the price is 6700 or 6000, price of btc is still cheaper than it is to mine at this current time and the market as a whole is a bargain compared to what it may potentially be in the coming months. Dont let your irrational thoughts get to you, take advantage of the deals in front of you even if it drops lower because youll be thanking yourself in due time. Also note we are still in an accumulation phase despite this drop. Just zoom out on the weekly/daily and you can see we are still trading sideways the past 2 months

Also cryptocurrencies and blockchain is super early and much more needs to be done before it can be adopted, can’t expect everybody to accept and utilize it before it’s fully developed and more convenient and secured wallets are available 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:17:39
If btc hit 1000 it be would 5x cheaper than it is to make. Just keep that in mind
@_date: 2018-06-04 13:50:42
Low volume = no new investors so they’re playing with the price till we get that next influx of people entering the market 
@_date: 2018-06-24 05:03:08
$5500 is where it actually dropped when the bcash drama occurred in November (my last big btc purchase) then it just kept going up till it went to 20k. Its either 5500 or itll test its last big resistance which was 5k. 5k btc is what everybody wanted for a while and it has never dipped that low since we broke thru it. So 5500 or 5000 i am calling the bottom. Also keep in mind, avg bitcoin mining cost currently is 5000-5500
@_date: 2018-06-30 17:11:01
Well doing less is best haha. You buy it, leave it somewhere safe and don’t think about it. Look at it a few years later, boom you did better than most haha
@_date: 2018-06-30 04:14:57
Yup if you got in october or earlier you are pretty okay so far
@_date: 2018-06-30 23:09:08
Well that is why don’t put in what you can’t afford.. you put money in crypto to invest, not to pay your bills and make extra money. You don’t put money in stocks just to cash out months later, you leave it and hope it does well in years’ to come
@_date: 2018-06-04 22:38:44
Yeah for bitcoin.. for smart contracts only a year.. For 3rd gen interoperability and scalability.. yet to be developed. Very very early

Well duh if you were to sell and then buy again at the same price you still get the same amount
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:00:05
I can see that being a necessary tool for many industries. Also just in everyday situations such as splitting a bill between a group of friends, gambling and games between individuals and groups of people. Also note, in a lightning network, you need to confirm a real transaction to the layer 1 network before you can open a channel on the layer 2 lightning network which doesnt seem convenient in many cases such as the examples i gave
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:32:05
Hodl and you don't have to worry about taxes 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:32
This is just a small dip, I still think it will correct below 9000, don't get all hyped up peeps
@_date: 2019-02-03 09:24:15
But in a lightning network, the funds you commit to the channel are strictly between those 2 parties right? I know it can be opened indefinitely but i can see if bitcoin does reach mass-scale adoption and now its going for 100k, traffic on the layer 1 can still be very congested due to the constant new channels being open. Just imagine somebody just getting into bitcoin at 100k, but bitcoin tx now is $100. If i want to use bitcoin with all the stores and services i used, that is a lot of open channels to make and initially creating these layer 1 confirmations can get expensive. Unless i am incorrect or im just missing something, please let me know, i know im not an expert
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:02:15
Yeah but not to $1000, $5000 would be the lowest it'll ever retrace imo
@_date: 2019-02-03 08:27:24
Theres questions of the Lightning network being centralized. Lightning network also only allows open channels between 2 parties which is impractical if multiple parties need to be involved. This also gives the opportunity for single entities like banks to create hubs between these parties which can only create further centralization. Besides the potential concerns of lightning, bitcoin still creates immense energy waste, has no smart contracts, no dapps, no privacy, no loops, forkable. People argue you can always add layers ontop of bitcoin to have these features but the bitcoin infrastructure was not designed that way, thus development of these layers will be more extensive and can cause more hard forks. I hope everybody can understand bitcoin can’t do everything and it shouldn’t. this space is about decentralization and we shouldn’t route for 1 project to do everything for us, that only causes another cycle of inequality. If there was more projects (which offer unique quality products and services) the more we can move away from the problems of centralization. I also believe bitcoin does have its place and will remain the top crypto for a while, but there are psychological barriers on top of its technicals. Not everybodys gonna want to own a fraction of a coin (not everybody can afford $3500 for a btc), they would rather own something they can acquire a lot of. there will always be people that want to get in a coin early. And there will always be people that are just salty of bitcoin (maybe due to missing out, or just being annoyed of hearing it) With that said, i still recommend bitcoin before buying alts but this is not a one dominates all space. Just my 2 satoshis

Bitcoin cash is the forked currency of bitcoin back in august to fix bitcoin's scalability. Another fork was suppose to go down this week called bitcoin segwit2x but it was cancelled so people in the community started to look at bitcoin cash as the better alternative to bitcoin because its cheaper and faster in transactions. This caused a breakout civil war between the bitcoins and the community itself where bitcoin cash went from $400 to $2800 and the regular bitcoin crashed down from $7800 to $5500. Since then, the fud has calmed down and bitcoin is now back to its glory over 7k
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:07:17

@_date: 2017-11-27 23:24:42
Keep in mind you just bought at all time high's, very risky cuz a correction is bound to happen and when it does, it will go below the current price. No need to panic though cuz in a year or so, $9500 will look dirt cheap

Bittrex - high volume so good for daily trading but ugly layout imo
Binance - for cheep fees and there options of coins. Their downfall is you can only sell/buy only in whole coins so that can get annoying 
 Kucoin - More user friendly imo, great layout and design, their passive income feature is awesome. Downside is their lack of volume and they listed confido which I have lost money on
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:25:42
Taxes are not relevant unless you cash out to fiat, not from alts to bitcoin

Bitcoin is a decentralized currency, disrupting traditional money. Its not going to disrupt banks and services but its going to disrupt practice of central banks from creating inflationary fiat. But in a broader picture, bitcoin wont replace banks but the technology will. When this technology evolves, it will decentralize and disrupt virtually anything centralized today from banks, media, commercial farms, online platforms and even our governments one day, moving us to a more trusted system. If you did enough research in this space, its more than just an alternative medium of exchange, we already have projects like omisego aiming to replace banks and another one called elastos aiming to change our entire internet infrastructure. So no specifically bitcoin wont tackle and replace banks head on but the tech it brought sure will
@_date: 2018-03-07 17:47:22

Everything going on atm reminds me of the sentiment of the market in dec 2017. Btc broke out to 16k and alts failed to keep up. At the time, everybody hated alts and many sold theirs at the bottom (including myself). if you were around then, you know what happened next... One thing i learned in this market thus far is that everything militates your thought-process. If you feel a certain type of way, just don’t trust it
