good idea, just don't do super small amounts (&lt;$0.25-$0.50), make them actually want to claim it :)

grab historical bitcoin price data
run a formula like this to start for the daily to give you daily returns (replace the 1's with 7's for weekly):
( (bitcoin price on day x) - (bitcoin price on day x-1) ) / (bitcoin price on day x-1)
the absolute value is how extreme the price jumped up or down that day or week

you can see the effects on the trailing year return (secondary y-axis / orange) increasing here -

seems like the industry has been building up very nicely as the price has dropped lol. a lot of investment $ from big names which is obviously a good sign. favorite new companies?

do you not "invest" in currencies or commodities hoping for a return, or at a minimum hoping to not have a negative return/losing money by holding it?

Not a noob question, but we can't really "expect" anything from the price of this brand new technology and we don't really have great/enough data to compare the correlation of returns on bitcoin vs other investments.
Check out these chart comparing the price movement on the "US stock market", represented by the S&amp;P 500 vs. the bitcoin price over 2 different time horizons -  Since the housing bubble crash in the US stock market around 2008/2009, the S&amp;P 500 has pretty much been on a relatively consistent, gradual increase and as we know, bitcoin barely even existed at this point and the price wasn't even worth a $1. We've seen bitcoin ramp up over $1000 very quickly and then gradually fall over the next 18 months losing over 75% of its value. Hard to really draw any relations between the price trends of the 2 there.
Maybe time will show that bitcoin's price is pretty well correlated or inversely correlated to the US or some other countries stock market, some interest rate trend, some commodity, or some other currency, but I don't think it's been enough time to start to try and draw any conclusions.
I'm pretty bullish on bitcoin as a whole, however don't know what that will actually mean in terms of it's price. Rather than trying to speculate on it in the future or decide when a good time to buy in is based on the news (which doesn't seem to make sense as of late anyways) I usually just pick up some small amounts of bitcoin over time, similarly to how I pick up mutual funds and such in my 401(k), etc.

cool - how do you do it/what're the details of your strategy? have you checked [this]( out

link to charts with older data (and obviously redic y axes) -

Meh, I wouldn't say it's extremely negative. Shows that despite a long and slow decline from the Dec '13 peak some very large previous year return values show up in the not so distant past. The imagery of the time span and size (area) of the positive previous year return values really dwarf the negative, and going back in time farther just makes it appear even more so. Obviously the large negative return from the long fall were painful, but the previous year return values are also increasing and hopefully continue to do so :)

agreed, thought it made up a far larger % during btc's price jumps

no offense... i'd like to think this may be the case as well :) but publicly saying stuff like that aint my style
@_date: 2015-06-11 19:09:50
sounds like you're making up financial advice... those price estimates are complete guesses
@_date: 2015-06-13 22:14:58
for bitcoin? of course not :)
