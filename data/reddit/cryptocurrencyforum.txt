BTC closed yesterday above $7,500, confirming a double bottom bullish breakout and the falling wedge reversal (bullish pattern). The breakout was also backed by strong volumes.
Momentum studies show a 5-day moving average (MA) and 10-day MA trending north, indicating bullish setup. The relative strength index (RSI) has moved above 50.00 (into the bullish territory).
So, the tide has turned in favor of the bulls, at least for the short-term.
A short-term bullish reversal has been confirmed.
BTC looks set to test resistance lined up at $8,500 (double bottom breakout target) and could extend gains to $8,620 (50-day moving average).
A Minor pullback to $7,600 cannot be ruled out as BTC looks overbought as per the RSI on the hourly chart and 4-hour chart.
Only a daily close below $7,000 would abort the bullish view.
