I understand that the public disclosure of those vulnerabilities would be a right thing to do. Is there a schedule for such disclosure?

Please link to your contributions to the codebase. Thank you.

It would work nicely for crypto, but you'd still have to exchange your fiat the old inefficient way.

Can you please recommend a better user friendly option? Thank you.
@_date: 2017-10-20 13:04:37
Thanks, fixed.

Well, the risk is no bigger than transacting on the blockchain which is pretty low risk if you ask me.

Someone just added 300 new btc1 nodes to the network. It is meant to create an impression that btc1 is getting more popular.
In reality it's probably not 300 nodes but rather 300 IP addresses that serve as proxies for a much lower number of actual nodes. In the end it's all about creating an illusion that helps them support their narrative.

Nah, noone has broken consensus yet, so you can upgrade a btc1 node without any noticable changes. It will just behave differently AFTER the hardfork happens.
Can they update the nodes in time before the HF block is a whole different question.

1. Move your bitcoin to new bitcoin address
2. If your transaction has not been replayed on the 2x chain then you can move your 2x coins to a new 2x address. You're done here, both coins are on separate addresses and transaction relay will no longer affect you.
3. If your bitcoin transaction has been replayed on the 2x chain then your 2x coins are sitting at the same address as your bitcoin. In that case you need to go to point 1, rinse and repeat.
Will this work or am I missing something?

That's a great point, I didn't realize this before.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:42:32
Here is the tricky part:


There is a list of wallets in OP's article that plan to follow the 2x chain and it includes some mobile wallets too, have a look.

Coincheck has no trading fees so their volumes are meaningless.
@_date: 2016-10-10 08:15:30


If you do that then you're not running a full node anymore.

Very nice list. I think it calls for a separate post ��
@_date: 2017-06-02 22:47:19
I like to think of it as a process of establishing new consensus.

The lowest fee Mycelium lets me pick is 174 sat/B. That is still too high.

Likely not. You probably load your account with BTC that serve as margin for positions that you take.
@_date: 2017-06-29 20:45:15
Thanks. Coinomi looks very promising and even has shapeshift on board. I'll definitely give it a try.

Yeah, I have Samourai but it's in early development and it crashed when after it transmitted the transaction. I wouldn't mind something more polished.
