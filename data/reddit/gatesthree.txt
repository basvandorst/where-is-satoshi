I think the true fear is that the technology will change and surface under a different name

I'm finding out my usage of a phrase is weird to people, I think this is the most interesting part of this post. And it's entirely on accident.

I think it's been solved ��
edit: I clicked a popup on the flash game that said "claim prize," and it directed me here  
I didn't complete all 13, I just got through ten, and thought I might have unlocked something. Not sure :)

I mean their interest is in a normative market, I think the sec approval will bring that, but I'm not certain the qualities are already present. Though I'm sure many will disagree.

Yeah that seems to be the case, protection of the people, and market manipulation.

Well, the heading leading into the questions start on page 4. It's literally semantics we're arguing, but thanks.

Yeah it's daunting, and deliberately confusing I think. I get it.

If you can convince them it's the same thing, only better, yes.

I got this message early in the morning and now am able to respond. Thank you for your input, I've decided to look more deeply and take on the subject for the community, hopefully we'll see some similar results in the States.
I'm mostly getting negative feedback on the subject, largely due to a massive mistrust of government which is what arguably drew people to crypto in the first place. I think despite the distrust the benefit for major institutions and corporations getting involved with trading would be a good thing for most of us.
I've opened a support ticket to Coinbase in hopes they will also lend a hand at submitting some information regarding the questions as well, though I will likely utilize your format for and continue the conversation there.
Thanks again, I hope to see more from you as I continue this process.
Edit: I did make an edit at the top, but made an entirely new post about the same basic stuff, called you out for your help and used both links you gave me, so thank you for that and hope to see what this might become. I don't think I would have continued this endeavor without you tipping the scales on my pseudo introversion lurking relationship I have with reddit. [Here's the Xpost](
