Your bubble has popped. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:53:50
Lol no it is not. This is not 2013 anymore. Most people who bought in this year did so to make a quick buck. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:05:18
What a nice sentiment: if you don't have the foresight of buying bitcoin early, you don't mean shit. This is the mentality of the bitcoin community that should scare the living daylights out of normal people. You will not win this man. Good luck. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 17:39:11
Been happening since $19k lol
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:47:30
Lol that sounds awful 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:20:55
Am in NYC area so I've known many, but that has nothing to do with the fact that I think bitcoin is in a mania phase right now, and the comment I made about the trans movement wasn't made here and is irrelevant to the topic. Am done talking about it here. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:24:10
That talk is not convincing to me anymore. I was never in it solely for the money. I thought it was cool and a a necessary innovation - now all I see is mania and the classic signs of a bubble, especially in the behavior/reactions from investors. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:26:07
Questioning your faith in this is toxic? Thank you for proving my point. You're in a mania man. Hope you get out unscathed. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:45:46
I think crypto future is with the trannies. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 22:07:14
Exactly why I left and will be their undoing.
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:15:30
Sell if you don't want huge losses. Bubble has popped.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:10:14
Lost me with your racism.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:29:05
Truly a smug comment. Great job.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:35:20
They have bits of it and altogether they have lots. I don't think a lot of them will react rationally when this plunges as it does normally and looks like is about to do. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-16 02:07:09
That's great. My parents are from there and can confirm it's not a bad place to live/work, not great, but pretty good overall. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:39:56
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:14:40
No, it's more akin to the dotcom bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:17:34
Sounds like projection brah
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:20:29
Pyramid scheme. Not enough new buyers
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:54:56
Been out since $19k which is becoming more and more clear that that was the top. Got lucky.

You brought up a comment I made out of context for next to no reason, so it seems like you're the one looking for a problem. I have the right to believe what I believe and it has nothing to do with this post. Let's end this now because you're starting to sound pretty hateful yourself. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:35:21
No, the wallet itself. Was having problems with api. Seems fixed now. Honestly thinking of switching over to Trezor. Seems like they have their shit together more. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:42:15
70% from $19k is around $6k and I think the get rich quick morons panic selling will get us there not futures. Futures were meant to provoke this exact herd response.
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:13:03
Y'all are gonna get your asses handed to you. Didn't read the post fyi. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:04:29
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:44:15
Lol at least you have a sense of humor, but no. Sold at $16k after 6 months of hodling simply because I don't want to be associated with this groupthink any longer. Decentralized my ass - you deviate from the script and you are shunned. Notice who is around you.

Bubble bursting 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:13:27
I still stand behind the sentiment.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:39:31
$19k was the top of the current mania
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:17:46
Thank you for that
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:47:31
Sell it for some Ziddu coins lol 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:24:39
How nice of you.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:19:53
Sounds about right
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:53:42
All of these posts of going all in should be alarming everyone. This is not rational behavior and the herd Novogratz was referring to is more and more sounding like he was referring to the general public, not his fellow hedge funders. Strippers promoting bitcoin and grandma promoting "big coin" anecdotes are clear signs of mania. Will end badly. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:23:50
I questioned if going up at this rate was justified online and in real life and was confronted by irate believers and that to me told me that this is ending soon. Also I just really don't like the arrogance here - definitely is something that is endemic in the bitcoin crowd. Pendulum will swing away again from bitcoin I think sooner than later. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:26:11
Lol I hope you don't really believe that. 10 years is not infancy

In agreement and I think $19k was the top. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:18:45
I don't think it has anything to do with whom you're implying. Bitcoin can potentially turn finance upside down and all types of people don't want that to happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:28:47
Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:48:10
No bump on the backside of a pyramid scheme lolz
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:49:46
I would like to help some people who are decent who have been seduced into this because of groupthink to leave bitcoin and realize there's a slim chance of more upside but a great chance of downside. Nothing goes up forever and the arrogance of this community is an ominous sign of a serious fall. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:06:23
Good luck to you 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:06:16
I thought bitcoin was supposed to be cash, meaning instant
@_date: 2017-12-18 15:40:27
It is not sound money. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:55:35
They do but I don't have to wait for very long confirmation. Now just waiting for lull.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:55:54
Lol dot com 2.0
@_date: 2017-12-11 21:10:18
Total mania right now. Strippers and uber drivers and get rich quick types are flooding in. Smart money is in alts/cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:25:00
Bubble that is all.
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:56:06
Be careful saying that. You will definitely get attacked now. You can't say anything negative or question the money cult. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:17:48
Requirements are currently strict for loans - that is true - but will be loosened bc greed. Gotta feed the money cult/bitcoin beast. We are rushing right into this mania. God help us. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:37:25
Love bitcoin but they're insane.
@_date: 2017-12-12 15:42:33
Will happen across country. Looking more and more like the panic will start in crypto this time around and spread from there. History repeating itself so clearly again and again. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 15:49:13
@_date: 2017-12-03 16:31:43
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:05:19
Not really. Was an early supporter and worked for a bitcoin miner in 2012 and still supported until the mania kicked in high gear recently. Questioning it got me rebuked and that is typical at the end of bubbles. You guys sound like you're part of some sort of money cult. Your arrogance will be your downfall guaranteed. Hopefully they outlaw it. I'd vote for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:17:10
Called it the other day - $19k is the top. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:20:22
No, they wouldn't play with crypto directly but will with derivatives. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:45:31
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:27:48
I think that it would be useful at this point to prevent millions of people from being swindled. Not hate but interest for my fellow human beings who will be induced into this mania/money cult.

Thank you, at least, for the non hostile/defensive response.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:41:57
Panic will be contagious but you probably already know that because you know everything, right? Typical arrogance and blind faith of a person hypnotized by hysteria. Good luck to you 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:27:00
Lol you are trying to compare computer code to an appliance. We are definitely at the top of the bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:18:59
Sell it as soon as you can. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:51
Being smug is actually going to deter new buyers that you depend on to keep the pyramid scheme going fyi ��
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:10:26
I don't. I sold them. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:42:32
People here are in denial. Oh well. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:19:26
Lol yeah good luck with that
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:18:19
Exactly but they're so cool/so much smarter than the rest that they're immune to it. They'll just respond with cool story bro. It's a cult. And it will definitely end when the whole world questions if they want smug millenials aka the whales controlling their finances. The traditional banker starts to seem sympathetic. Panic selling will come and we will look back at this as hysteria. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:56:35
Nope. The smugness of this community turned me against it. Have no short position.

@_date: 2017-12-12 03:39:38
Typical response in the mania phase of a bubble. It's great because you confirm my intuition. This is no way an s-curve. Look at any commodity chart in its bubble phase and take a step back from the echo chamber and think. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:55:03
No, not too late. It's still a good idea to buy now when the majority of the latest investors are driven by pure speculative greed who don't understand the tech. GL
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:28:55
Bubble is bursting/bursted. Some nocoiners like myself have been trying to warn you but the pride/arrogance of this community can't see it. They are blind. But they will be humbled eventually, and it's looking like it's starting now. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 06:11:01
Thank you for saying it. Must be repeated as much as possible here until more of them wake up and leave the cult.
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:45:17
@_date: 2017-12-11 05:30:48
I still think that bitcoin is in a bubble. And I suspect $19k is the top. Too much dumb money flooding in. Am working on EE masters, so I do understand math, but you know it's cool to just be a smug bitcoin reddit guy like yourself and dismiss it because you're biased. Have a nice night. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:21:23
I'm not so bold to predict, but I think this has almost run its course, and I don't think so because of transaction fees/confirmation times etc., but I see the writing on the wall by the way this community treats others - also second mortgages and credit card purchases are eery echoes of final stages in a mania. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:45:29
Lower lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 14:16:59
Good succint answer. Definitely a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:04:22
Yes, this latest run up was different seeming than past ones and coordinated with futures it seems to me like institutional money is here and doing what they usually do.

What you see as desires I understand as delusions. No evidence that the trans movement isn't another mania as well. But you know feels is all that matters.

@_date: 2017-12-19 06:21:03

Short answer: scheduled rise of interest rates. Thank you for being understanding by the way, and more open minded. These are sorely needed traits in bitcoin.

I think it's a gamechanger in many ways and will replace a lot of currencies if not become the reserve currency of the world but there are many powerful interests against it and I think we're going to see some intense struggles very soon.
