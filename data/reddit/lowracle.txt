Yes you are right, this is not safe in this environment 
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:18:00
Okay I see your point, but here keep in mind that segwit is not a threat to bitcoin, it is just an add on, just another type of transaction. It is not a change of consensus. If you think segwit is dangerous, just don't make segwit transactions. Taken out of the drama, UASF is a good idea, as normally, in an healthy environment, miners would do everything they can to avoid a hard fork, which means checking for invalid UASF transactions. The choice of a fork would then be delegated to the users ! Shouldn't it be like this ? A system where the users decide which features they want to use ? 
@_date: 2017-03-06 21:28:06
It's not UASF that would be causing the hard fork, it is the miners that mine invalid blocks. I don't see how you can consider UASF a threat, where is the problem ? You don't like segwit transactions, you don't mine them. But if 100% of transactions are segwit, then maybe you should consider aligning yourself with the will of the community. I mean, it is just adding an opt-in feature to a system. If you don't like it don't use it. Just take some step back, and imagine a crypto currency which implements UASF, and which is not made by bitcoin core. Don't you think this is actually a pretty good scheme for smooth upgrades ?
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:08:08
UASF is not about node count.

I also think they want the best for their people. That is why they are doing investigations in these exchanges to protect investors. Someone just posted this: 
I don't know what they think about bitcoin. It may be their goal long term to support it. But here, these investigations were made in a context of a lot of exchanges breaking rules. They were not made in a context of a support campaign for Bitcoin. I hope what you are saying is true, that would be really great for the image of bitcoin, but I don't have enough information to speculate.
@_date: 2017-01-13 09:14:01
I am not sure if I understood everything, but it may be possible you are mismanaging your private keys. If you put a private key/ wallet/ seed in a safe for cold storage, it should never be on your computer. Once you need those coin, you swipe them ALL from the private key in your safe, keep the amount you want, and resend the remaining to a NEW private key which will go to your safe. I have read a case where someone used a cold storage paper wallet to send coins, using a new wallet. The wallet sent the change to a change address. Unaware of change addresses, the user deleted the wallet with the change in it, thinking the rest of the bitcoin would stay on his paper wallet.

@_date: 2017-01-13 10:34:21
I understand. However, I think exchanges are becoming more and more secure. Coinbase, Gemini, and the maybe coming ETF. Either you control the keys and thus you have to learn how it works, either you take the easy path and let others handle it for you, at the cost of your privacy. I would love that everyone understand how all of this work, and be his/her own bank. Unfortunately, people don't have the time/knowledge.
@_date: 2017-01-26 09:06:05
Because maybe people stopped sending transactions as they don't want their bitcoin getting stuck for 2 days ?

Nice ! So your algorithm managed to predict the demonetization of India ? And the devaluation of the Chinese yuan ? The scaling debate ? Venezuela crisis ? This is some advanced AI, you should put this into good use instead of using to trade BTC. Maybe help avoid WW3 ? Anyway, I myself have a prediction algorithm for the BTC price, it is very simple, it is an exponential function with few parameters here and there.

Of course, the community is one uniform group with only one opinion. Also, this "community" does nothing to help bitcoin scale. It's not like people from everywhere in the world with different cultures are part of the Bitcoin community. 
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:39:13
Yes. What I meant is, helping bitcoin isn't their goal. Their goal is to regulate the exchanges, and the effect is that it will reduce bitcoin's volatility.
@_date: 2017-01-13 14:10:29
Of course there was more volume yesterday, just after the dump at 4893.... We need to wait longer to see the effect of the restrictions.
@_date: 2017-01-12 10:16:16
No, they are trying to regulate exchanges which influence the price and offer ridiculous amount of margin. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 13:42:15
Shorts and longs are restricted. I haven't any proofs of how much these highly leveraged positions influence bitcoin, but I am sure the three "pump" then "dump" you can see on the weekly chart are due to highly leveraged positions. During a bull run, people get excited and enter in leveraged positions, which implies they will have to be paid back one day. The first closing his/her position before the crash is the first winning. In the mean time, normal people who want to invest in bitcoin don't realize they are buying at a highly inflated price due to leverage and speculation, and most often, they are the one paying the bill. To go a bit further, exchanges can incentivize traders to take loan during a bull run, by offering low interest for example, and by judiciously choosing a settlement date, they can force them to close their position at the same time, causing the price to drop drastically. The second part is for the one who want to believe it, I have no proof of this, but I think it is possible, as it seems like easy money lemon squeezy.
@_date: 2017-01-26 08:07:07
Wrong ! Bhoo ! You don't know what you are talking about. The hashrate increased a lot while the difficulty stayed the same, as it is only adjusted every ten days, which led a block every 7 or 8 minutes in average. Then, the difficulty gets adjusted, but people keep sending transactions as if we were still on a "a block every 8 minutes" schedule. This leads to a backlog which increases very fast. 
Now, maybe a spam attack could have been timed at the difficulty increase, but I have no proof of this.
Note that this shows that as soon as more space is available, people use it. Which means a 2mb block increase will reach its limit very fast. The fact that the backlog goes back down shows that the bitcoin network regulate itself, this is quite fascinating.
@_date: 2017-01-13 10:28:27

Didn't you read the BIP ? This is just a constant, which automatically sunsets, so it goes away after a certain amount of block ok ? Understandable ? From the mail: 
"This sun-setting avoids the accumulation of technical debt due
to retaining enforcement of this rule when it is no longer needed
without requiring a hard fork to remove it."
But hey yes 5 lines of code which automatically sunset are very bad compared to an exploit that allows mining centralization and stop the development of the protocol.

Of course, but ASICBOOST is not intentional. If we discover a bug in elliptic curve cryptography, would you not want to upgrade the protocol, just for the sake of "Muh protocol, Muh game theory" ?

In all those example you gave, none actually increases the value of your holding if you bought bitcoin. Crossing borders, or hedging against inflation, doesn't increase the value of your holdings. So where does the profit of OP comes from ? It is zero sum because the only way for Bitcoin to gain value is by having new people coming in. All those alt coins which offer the same services you described, if not more, why aren't they valuated at the same amount then ? As they provide the same services / have the same value ? You have to agree the majority money OP won comes from someone else.

Why would a miner signal for segwit and not check blocks for illegal anyone-can-spend transactions ? I assume people will wait a lot of time before starting to use segwit, so to be sure that their bitcoin will not find themselves spent by someone on the forked chain. I mean, what is the reason for miners to actually signal segwit to get bip148 passed, and then not apply its rules ? Those would be miners with the intention to fork the network, and thus could have done it with or without UASF anyway.
@_date: 2017-05-14 19:01:26


Please read the top comment. I'm stopping here because you definitely don't want to cooperate. 
The main point when I said this is that IT CAN'T BE that all he won is due to added value, so THERE MUST BE money coming from someone else.


Ho yes we discussed that didn't we ? But are you actually too stupid to make link with what we discussed earlier ? Can we make a progress please ?
You said that traders in the derivative market were bringing value, but here the hedge against inflation is for the OP, so he brings value for HIMSELF + gains profit ? Man please read what you said. IT IS NOT THE SAME


Stupid once again. your memory only works for the last 10 minutes.
You said:


And I say: You have to prove that hashing power affects the price for this to be an argument against the fact that alts have a lower market cap due to less hashing power. Dude :( losing my mind here trying to think for you.


He may have added value but the point is that the MAJORITY of his profit comes from some else and so on the other hand there is someone losing money. THAT is it, but then you came in and started throwing the argumentation away. Please re-read the thread please, and see how you got lost 
@_date: 2017-05-19 12:08:17
People are going to do it anyway, why not make it easier ? At least, like that, it is quite clear it is dangerous to send segwit transactions when the segwit support hasn't been settled. Why would somebody send a segwit transaction if the majority doesn't support segwit anyway ? The goal of UASF is to see if, due to economic incentives, (from a stronger user support / demand), miners are going to switch on the UASF fork, making it the most-work chain, but nobody has to create segwit transactions during those time of uncertainty, and nobody will, so this PR is basically useless, except to remind people to wait for the UASF fork to be dropped or to be the most work chain.

Imagine how the situation of these people could be improved if segwit was activated and they were able to trade without any confirmation time.

We clearly have gold here, bitcoin isn't a "geek" thingy, it is a true revolution, and a few greedy people are holding it back
@_date: 2017-05-19 10:21:41
Well because they don't want to get forked out of the network. Would you take the risky bet, as a miner, that the BIP148 will not be enforced even though the majority is signalling for it ? Except if you collude with other miners forming a majority (thus an intention to fork), this is a stupid bet to take.

@_date: 2017-05-18 18:13:38


The miners who don't support segwit are going to run invalidate-block, but what if all the user's nodes don't, and the reorg is only blocked for the miners ? Well what I mean is, it is very hard to coordinate a 'invalidate-block', except if the ones willing to do it release their own client with block invalidation hard coded inside. But I don't think a lot of users are going to switch to this node implementation, except maybe the BU side. Thus, I think we will eventually have a segwit fork and a BU fork.

No because he has food in exchange. He can eat the food


Yes, because he can't eat the damn bitcoin. He bought in the hope to sell it later at a higher price, nothing was exchanged, it was a bet and he got fooled
As simple as that.
When I'm saying OP's money came from someone else, it means he got this money with nothing in exchange, nothing was exchanged for the money he received by selling his now more valuable bitcoin. I assumed you would understand that, I was wrong. If you can't make the distinction between buying breads and buying into a (nearly) zero-sum game, I can't do anything actually. So yes I understand now why the debate got lost

Okay dude get back on hearth now, can you please remember what I am trying to say here ? I am just saying that what he won comes from someone else, that's it. Maybe that makes you feel bad about yourself, not my problem, but accept the fact omg. 
Now I will continue the diverged debate, while trying to make my point more clear through it.
You are talking about derivatives market, nice examples like hedging etc, cool but we are in the bitcoin world here. I'm not saying investment return is not deserved, like I said, in this case OP didn't provide any capital to the bitcoin developers for them to use it. It's not because some investment vehicles and derivatives that are useful and provide value by capital, hedging or liquidity exists, that it makes bitcoin one of those. I don't see the link here sorry.


Quite predictable one here. Why is it so hard to understand. I said this because your argument can only be valid if it is the case, so to use this as an argument, you would have to prove that prices comes from the hashing power, as simple as that. 
My point was that, as you seem to have missed it, if the market cap of Bitcoin was due to its value only, then altcoins providing the same value should have the same market cap, but it's not the case. So a big part of this market cap has to come from people entering the market / speculation, so a lot of OP's money has to come from someone else, and not increase of value of the underlying asset. Come from someone else, that's just what I am saying, come from someone else.

So our economy is basically everyone taking and giving money from and to each other and no one creates value ? No, the majority of everyone's money doesn't come from someone else, it comes from the value this person has produced. But the majority of trader's money comes from someone else yes.


I see what you mean here but don't you think you are pushing the argument a little bit too far ? Do you think it is fair for someone that has anonymously bought bitcoin in 2011 to be rewarded 1000..% of his initial investment just for the little pump in the price he has produced back then ? It isn't, and he is rewarded disproportionately, and how do you compensate with this disproportion ? With someone else's money. I understand what you mean, but the "value" he produced by investing early counts for 1% of the profit of OP. You have to agree a majority of his gains come from some else. 
As for the hashing power argument, you still have to prove that the price comes from the hashing power and not the inverse. I'm pretty convinced hashing power increases with the price, and not the other way around.

Not talking about adoption..... I'm talking about speculation.

No because he said he is her biggest bitcoin influence. When your butcher across the street start to talk about bitcoin, that's when you get out

The reorg can occur at any time right ? Even if it takes say 1000 blocks for the BIP148 fork to catch up ?

You won, I'm angry now. But please try to follow more the ideas, so when you discuss with someone it actually leads somewhere

Are you out of your mind ? Have you seen any attack against other bitcoin nodes implementation ? This guy is the devil, sucking every money out of something made voluntarily, open source. Please document yourself on who he is. And also give me other attacks on good bitcoin node implementations. Thanks

Theses posts are funny, "Thanks bitcoin now I can buy a house", "Thanks bitcoin now I have no more student debts". The money you won, you took it to someone else, no money was created out of thin air.

Not alone at all. Bitcoin is the beginning of a new era, where we are not ruled by inflation. Where we are not forced to "consume", buy more foods than we need, buy a new car every 4 years,... Bitcoin marks the end of this forced economic expansion, and reading the comments on this thread makes me full of hope. It seems like the majority of people who have bitcoins are nice people, normal people, not the elite which has access to an investment vehicle before the mass, and which then dumps it on us like the SNAP Inc. stock.

Yes this is mind blowing to think that people building bitcoin wallet securing millions suck completely in security. Never use this wallet

Hoooo I get it, I think you are mixing "fractional reserve" and "federal reserve" haha ! But it's okay :) You need to read about fractional reserve and what it really means for a bank to have a fractional reserve. Then, learn about how new money is created by the **federal** reserve, and how it has nothing to do with **fractional** reserve of banks ! Of course both have their role in the economy, but those two things are different ! Cheers

Duh ! If this wasn't posted, a lot of users wouldn't have known to switch wallet.

what sorry ? Why this tone ? I am clarifying what we are talking about. You are talking about the central bank and not common banks. I haven't denied anything. This is a fact that any bank can have a fractional reserve of any kind of asset. It isn't limited to the dollar. I think you are mixing a bit the different things in place. There is bond issuance from the government, and there is fractional reserve from banks. But the two can exists independently of each other. It is possible to have bitcoin banks which can do fractional reserve, but where the money supply isn't controlled by anyone, as no federal reserve will be able to "print" bitcoin so as to buy government bonds.

Too soon

Yhea sure, so you are talking about the federal reserve / central bank, not banks in general. Fractional reserve is still possible with bitcoin though, go read the definition of it. 


You don't need to have a central bank / federal reserve which can print money to do fractional reserve
@_date: 2017-06-12 08:21:30
Wut ? Bank can still do fractional reserve with bitcoin, exactly like they do with the dollar. You deposit 10 BTC, bank gives 9 of them as a loan to someone. Boom, you now have an economy with 19 BTC, and a bank with a fractional reserve of 10%
@_date: 2017-06-12 23:15:21
I don't see how it is different from a fractional reserve with dollars. The bank can't create new dollars out of thin air.. The dollars it loans you come from someone. Are you talking about the federal reserve or the banks here ?

Sorry what ? You really are a developer ? ... Storing an encrypted seed, decrypting it at launch with a user password and keeping it only in RAM is a LOT more secure and at basically NO additional cost. Which wallet are you developing so I know to never use it ?
