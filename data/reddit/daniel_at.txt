its a competition to GIT actually...
@_date: 2016-04-26 17:55:10
It got fixed about 6h ago and the update is in the playstore, you should get it soon.
It would be better to write us directly via mail, then we can help you usually better and faster.

Hi, Im one of the developers: That permission is only needed for GCM (Google cloud messaging, used to send notifications about local trader events to the devices): 
And its only needed in the old (now unmaintend, only security fixes) version of mycelium: 
(Therefor some users see different needed permissions, depending on their android version)

Hi, one of the developers here - somehow we missed you mail - where did you write it to?
What happens, when you scan the pairing link on cashila? Does is show an error? Either in the browser or on your phone?

As only current Betatester can see the G+ post, here is the copy/paste:
 
**Mycelium 2.0 HD - Welcome to the future**
Mycelium 2.0 RC1 has been pushed to the play store for everyone in the beta channel, and will be available for upgrade in an hour or two.
Please give us feedback over the next week so we can improve before the global launch.
**New Features**
 - Support for BIP32/BIP44 compliant HD accounts based on a single master seed
 - Setter security through one-time wordlist-backup (BIP39)
 - Better anonymity, no more address reuse
 - Ability to label transactions
 - Create transactions with poor or no internet connectivity for later broadcasting
 - No more restrictions to the number of watch only addresses
**What does HD mean?**
HD is short for Hierarchical Deterministic. Typically, bitcoin wallets generate each new bitcoin address from a unique random number, requiring a separate backup of each new address. To avoid losses from lack of backups, such wallets use a single bitcoin address for all your transactions. HD wallets instead use a “master seed” (a single large random number), to derive all future bitcoin addresses sequentially from that single seed. This means that you only need to make a backup once, and all the keys generated by an HD wallet can be restored at any time in the future just from that single master seed. HD wallets greatly improve your privacy by being able to keep generating new addresses. If you use the same address continuously all your transactions will be associated with a single address, and because all bitcoin transactions are public anyone can see what addresses you are sending funds to, and calculate your total balance. With an HD account new addresses are created whenever you send and receive funds, making your transaction activity and total balance very hard to track.
**But I liked it the way it was! Will I have to change the way I use it?**
All your keys, addresses and address book entries will be retained when you upgrade your app. The tab previously named “Keys” has been renamed to “Accounts.” Your old bitcoin addresses will become single address accounts, and you can continue to use them as before. We do advise that you switch to new HD accounts, though. You will also see your first empty HD account, which you can start using right away.
**What about previous backups? Do my old ones still work?**
Yes. You can still import keys and addresses you backed up with the previous version of Mycelium Wallet. However, we have removed the ability to create backups of single keys, or create new single addresses accounts. Instead, we advise you to backup your master seed and move your funds to the new HD wallet. As long as you keep your old backups, though, you will be able to recover your legacy accounts using Mycelium. To import a private key, switch to the “Accounts” tab, tap the icon with a key and plus symbol in the upper right corner, and select “Advanced”. Then scan your encrypted private key and enter the password.
**Will I be able to continue to use my current Local Trader identity?**
Yes. Your Local Trader identity will get carried over to the new version when upgrading along with your private keys. 
**How do I make a backup?**
To create a backup, either tap the “Secure My Funds” button on the main page, or choose “backup” from the menu. You will be shown a list of words, one after the other. Write those words down with pen &amp; paper. You then have to type in the words again, to make sure you got everything right. Store this word list in a safe place! Anybody who obtains this list can access current and future funds in your wallet! Once you have completed your backup, you cannot see your word list again. This is to prevent others from getting to your current or future funds if they obtain your phone. Note: The backup procedure only backs up your HD accounts. Your classic single address accounts are not part of this backup procedure. 
**How do I restore a backup?**
If your phone is lost or damaged you can make a fresh install of the mycelium wallet on a different device. Upon startup, choose “Restore Backup”. Choose 12 as the length of your word list, and let the “password” checkbox unchecked, and proceed to enter your word list. This recreates your master seed and automatically creates and synchronizes your first HD account. It might take some time until your first account is synchronized and the balance updates. If you had more than one account, navigate to the “Accounts” tab, tap the button with a key icon and plus on the upper right corner, and choose “Add HD Account” to re-create your second account, etc. Note: This procedure only restored up your HD accounts. To restore your classic accounts you have to manually import each key/address by going to the Accounts tab, click the + button, select Advanced, and then Import.
If your previous Mycelium installation had a Local Trader account you can recreate your trader account and data by clicking “Buy/Sell Bitcoins”, select the “My Info” tab, click “Create” and select the account that your local trader identity was associated with. 
**Can I restore BIP44 accounts created with other wallets?**
Yes. When you start a fresh install of the app you get the option to restore a backup. You can choose between word lists lengths of 12, 18, or 24 words, and also supply an optional password in accordance with BIP44. This way you can restore all HD accounts generated by other wallets compatible with BIP44 and BIP39. For instance, this allows you to import your TREZOR word list in case your device was lost or damaged so you can quickly move your funds to safety.﻿

Oh yeah, they really laught about:
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:55:29
The device will have the option to provide a user generated salt (e.g. dice throws). Then for each paperwallet, it will generate a random number, take the salt and hash them both together and use this as the private key.
It will provide a secondary output (maybe a textfile) which shows the random number, your salt and the result. So you can verify that everything was computed correct.
This provides following benefits:
* You can be sure, that even if mycelium had a weak or deterministic RNG, they are unable to guess your private key
* If your salt (your dice throws) is not truly random, your private keys will be
* Even if your salt is captured by a key-logger while you enter it, it weakens your private keys not a bit.
* The only option would be that mycelium installs a keylogger on _your_ computer and have implemented a deterministic RNG. But this would be clearly shown in the source code (which will be open source and flash-able)

me too... :'/
@_date: 2017-02-01 10:13:12
Does it currently really help miners to have more tx available than other miners? It would only help if the txs have a lot of miner fee set - otherwise I dont see any advantage of this service.
@_date: 2016-03-23 12:11:31
what phone do you have?
@_date: 2016-01-08 14:04:13
Have a look at this: 
@_date: 2016-01-25 09:35:24
With the next update Mycelium will show you a warning if you receive an RBF-tagged transaction (or any unconfirmed input of it), like that: 
We will also try to improve the UX, if an unconfirmed tx got replaced.
@_date: 2017-01-27 22:02:21
Yeah, sorry for that - just fixed it. Generally its better to reach out to us via info then we can support you usually better.
@_date: 2016-11-16 21:56:33
The PIN entry will get progressevly slower on each wrong try, so that after ~20 tries, it will take already 10 minutes for the next pin to enter.
In addition, always keep your 12 word backup secure and reachable, so when your phone gets stolen, you can move away the funds to a secure location before the attacker has enough time to crack the phone/wallet somehow
@_date: 2016-11-19 09:52:47
No, the internal PIN also has an increasing delay for each wrong entry
And you are right trezor, ledger and keepkey have the same
@_date: 2015-08-24 08:28:30
Hi Mark0Sky,
Daniel from Mycelium here: thats a strange bug. Does this still happen, if you scan the QR code from the screenshot (you provided in PM) again? I get the correct payment request, but its marked as timed out.
Does it always happen, also if you create a new Wikipedia donation?
Whats your Android OS version and what locale have you set?
@_date: 2015-08-25 18:32:32
Mycelium marks its data to be not included in the stock backup - im not sure how titanium backup handles this flag, but the normal android backup respects it.
Therefor we take extra care, that the user backups his masterseed manually.
@_date: 2015-08-26 06:38:29


So, to clarify: there are still spendable funds in this account, which did not got stolen?
That is really strange - if an attacker gets his hands on either the seed or the walletbacking.db (which by default is excluded from the stock backup) it has access to all ever generated private keys. Then it is strange that only one output got stolen.
Can you send us the backuped .apk file? Its very unlikely that it got tampered with, but just to be sure. (or take the sha1 hash of it and send it to us)
 
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:43:45
Have you already set a destination address? The fee calculation needs the amount and the address. Otherwise the fee does not get displayed
Can you send us a screenshot of your transactions-tab and the "enter recipient" screen and maybe the "enter amount" screen (where it shows max-spendable amount) to info
Even if our fee-estimation backend is not responding, the wallet should choose default fees - so thats quite strange.
@_date: 2015-08-18 07:32:49
Yes and no... If you use a trezor, the malware can not steal the private key easily. But it could replace the mycelium installation completely with a hacked version, which redirects each payment you make (and sign with trezor) to its own address.
All it needs to do is just replace the scanned address from the QR code with its own. If you dont compare it with the address from the website you just scanned (who does this after all), then the validation on the trezor screen also doesnt help at all.
But that would only work for one payment and then you would notice it very likely.
@_date: 2015-08-25 16:19:24
Hi daniel from mycelium here,
sorry to hear about your lost coins - we wont be able to get them back, but it would be great if you could help us to narrow it down, if it is a bug on our side.
Please contact us at info with following details:
 * Did you make the titanium backup before or after you received the 1.399 BTC?
 * Was that the first/last transaction before/after the backup?
 * Did you receive other coins since that backup? Are they still here
 * Care to share the xPub of the account the coins got stolen from?
 * Did you ever export the xPriv or xPub of that account before?
 * Do you have other accounts based on the same seed? With funds? 
In any case, i would recommend to move to a new master seed (send all funds to a other temporary paper/wallet, delete mycelium data, start mycelium to generate new master seed, send funds back)
Ah, and btw: never use a rooted phone to store more bitcoin than you are wiling to lose.
@_date: 2015-07-07 12:49:42
In this times of economy the budget is quite limited... ^^^(no,it-was-only-for-the-screenshot...)
@_date: 2015-08-06 14:59:14
And you ("you" in general terms, not "you slush0", because i guess you already have one) can use "mycelium.com" as a promo code to get it even cheaper.
@_date: 2015-07-14 17:11:57
did you make more than one backup? or did you restart the backup-routine before writing down the password? As the checksum matches, its most likely a valid password, but not for this backup-run.
We never changed anything on the backup routine, but i can give you the link to an old apk if you want to try. Do you know which version you used before?
@_date: 2015-07-15 13:04:54
Yes, we can do better - and we are currently doing...
Over the last five days  (yes, even though there was a weekend), since we noticed problems with our backend (due to the high blockchain load) I started to improve our transaction-tracking backend and rewrote a lager part of it. 
The first part of the rewrite is done and I just deployed the new code on some of our backends and will keep an eye on it. But so far it looks good/better. But there is still some room for improvements, which I'll tackle in the next days.
In parallel we started to implement an option to switch to other backends (insight in the first step, maybe others to come), should we again have difficulties with our backends.
Some days ago I was quite frustrated someone is spamming the blockchain for no good, but now after all I'm quite happy that we (and many others) got the right amount of "motivation" to improve our code and architecture. 
@_date: 2015-07-10 07:40:37
Thank you very much :)  Bookmarked and will definitely use it, when someone needs some basic information.
Daniel (one of the mycelium devs)
@_date: 2015-07-10 11:56:56
You have to import the trezor account into your mycelium wallet first (Accounts -&gt; Add -&gt; Advanced -&gt; Trezor). Then select the trezor account before you go to Sepa payment and it will use the trezor to sign the transaction.
@_date: 2015-07-14 10:49:27


Does it say "The checksum is invalid. Please verify." (instantly) or "The password you entered is not valid." (after takeing some time to decrypt the key)
In the first case you probably only have a typo somewhere, the second case means you have a valid password (checksum matches) but this is not the correct password for this backup. Did you make more than one backup back then? Did you mix up the keys?
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:21:37
Current Mycelium beta wallet has fee estimation (based on the half-assed bitcoin-core values)
@_date: 2015-07-10 12:48:40
Yeah, i know... our help lags quite behind our feature set... 
@_date: 2015-07-15 17:57:39
[Thank you](
@_date: 2015-07-07 10:01:14
im one of the devs, guess whats currently on my screen?
@_date: 2015-04-02 14:29:57
Kind of - somehow i didnt read your last sentence and i thought you suggest the watch-only scenario.
Because, if you import the xpub via scanning, mycelium does not know that this is a trezor account and wont allow you to send from it via per trezor.
@_date: 2015-04-02 13:29:50
Mycelium can also import a Trezor account directly from the trezor via usb (has the same function as you suggested), but  and when you want to send funds from it, you can plug in the trezor and sign the transaction with it  (Accounts -&gt; Add Account -&gt; Advanced)
@_date: 2015-04-09 07:28:12
Thanks, we will look into this. 
Next time for reporting security sensitive bugs, please mail them us directly (info as listed on github and our website) - thank you.
@_date: 2015-04-04 10:04:13
If you emptied the paper wallet and arent planning to use it again (you shouldnt anyways), we would be happy if you could send it to us -&gt; developers
(send us a picture of it, including the address and the encrypted key and the password)
@_date: 2015-04-09 13:58:30
Trezor? I think OP was talking about the PIN-on-app-start function.
@_date: 2015-09-11 09:27:31
Hi, can you send a detailed description (link to the invoice or a screenshot, your phone type/OS version, mycelium version, screenshot of the error message in mycelium) to info - then we can help you probably.


We want to be sure that the payment request is valid and not some faked (or a replayed one, therefor the timestamp check). And its very unlikely that all users will check each detail for each payment request them self.
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:51:13
the first point is a regression we didnt notice - will be fixed in the next dot release.
the second one (the "not broadcasted") means that the server was broadcasting you transaction but hadnt seen it on the P2P-network the moment you synced. After the next sync it already received it back from at least one peer and so its marked as broadcasted.
@_date: 2015-04-04 09:33:22
Either export the xPub key from a mycelium running on a different phone, or from a trezor (via MyTrezor.com, under advanced) or use a trezor + usb directly with Mycelium
@_date: 2015-04-02 07:31:26
Nice video!
Im one of the wallet devs - so thank you for providing a well made how-to of our software. Ill keep it bookmarked and link to it, if someone has a question.
One beer on me, @_date: 2015-04-04 09:22:30
you are _not_ supposed to trust mycelium either. Thats the reason we put the user provided seed option in there.
@_date: 2015-03-21 11:43:08
Here is the documentation, which should explain everything the device does: 
@_date: 2015-11-07 18:29:40
Thank you :D


btw, you can now even use HD-paperwallets, its a bit slower, but it even should make LukeJR happy. Unfortunately I dont know of any good HD-paperwallet generator besides our "Entropy"-stick, which is currently sold out.
@_date: 2015-11-04 19:45:50
just scan the private QR code of the PDF with a recent version of your mycelium wallet. It should ask you for the 16-letter string to unlock your backup.
@_date: 2015-11-12 11:15:16
if you are on android, there is a setting for that
@_date: 2015-03-31 08:30:34
Im one of the mycelium devs. I compared the file you have extracted from the stick and its only a padding problem: 
Your file has some 10000 "FF" Bytes append, but the rest of the file (see left bar from screenshot, only red areas are different) is the same.
How did you copy the file from the stick and in what mode was it? (what was its drive name?)
I have forwarded it to our entropy-guys, but its nothing to worry about.
You can compare it yourself with "Beyond Compare" (it has a free trial period)
@_date: 2015-11-03 16:41:30
Thx :) Was a good experience to work with the guys from cashila.
And also good to hear others liking our implementation. Sofar i thought i was the one using it the most :) - havent opened my "normal" banking website much lately
@_date: 2016-05-16 13:51:04
Hello, can you describe whats not working or what error to you get?
Usually you can reach us better via mail to info 
@_date: 2015-10-05 19:25:25
Even if you dont work for us, you should get a little bit for your help.
1 answer Just to add to rowdy_beavers answer: sometimes (depending on the tx) its necessary to "Reload account" first, then cancel it and then reload again.
We are working on it to make it smoother
@_date: 2015-03-31 08:33:17
Thats the reason we included the option for a user provided seed with proof-able results
@_date: 2016-07-28 10:06:03
In the picture you see a nice use case for InfinityUSB ( - a USB cable with an integrated hub.
For the reason why: because its possible. I dont see any real use case having more than one HW wallet attached at the same time.
Source: made that picture in the OP
