Then you buy $10 next week and repeat when you have a decent amount or the fees drop again transfer it to your wallet. If you need that $10 asap you probably shouldn't have bought it in the first place.

Well coinbase is going to implement segwit support soon and they offer free transfer from GDAX. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:20:22
Weekly buy off coinbase is pretty cheap and it transfers from GDAX for free.

If the exchanges would have offered as much support towards segwit as BCH would this situation even be like it is? like exchanges that want to trade in both drop both at the same time since both were created to solve the same issue if my understanding is correct.

If its a large amount coming into a US bank when you sell you might cause a few red flags.

Are you using a segwit wallet? Also its kind of a bad time with alot of people swapping to btc in the hopes of bitcoin gold free coins and then swapping out. Then there was a 21% difficulty increase within the same week that caused miners to mine more profitable chains and slow transactions and also raise fees on the btc chain.

Was expecting a shitty blog with adds pasted everywhere, not sure if this is more or less disappointing.

"Why would miners temporarily switching to bch cause an increase of price?" are we not talking about bch price? I was mainly talking about that increase. I do understand that btc going from 6k down is literally nothing to really worry about its just consolidation and finding a price that people are comfortable with.
When I say "wait to send transactions" I mean time from when they either bought it and it shows up in their wallet or send from x wallet to another that turns alot of people off. Yes I know the user can set the fee but there are millions of people getting into that just go with what their wallet defaults to. Sending $10 for a $2 fee does not look good sending $10 with a low fee that takes hours also does not look good.
Also be more humble "you must be new here" "I don't think you actually understand how Bitcoin works" comes off as kind of dickish, just correct me if im wrong so ill learn something.

From your post history it seems like you are a dude and not a single mother. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 06:44:28
Because when they switched to bch the btc fees got higher as did the wait to send transactions. People act on emotion and panic and swap to alts when stuff like that happens so alts usually rise. 
edit: also speculation not just emotion if you know miners are playing whats more profitable they likley buy some bch as they swap to mine to inflate the price. Remember alot of the miners that have alot of hashpower can also be whales for a good pump and dump as they get alot of blocks per hour due to the difficulty

looks more like an add for OP's site

From my limited technical understanding its more that the nodes secure the network as they are the ones that accept or decline the miners "work" based on the code. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:47:29
I mean bitcoin which happens to be using cores code currently. They will switch to what ever chain is more profitable until it isnt. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 02:30:39
Pretty sure it has to do with bitcoin mining difficulty going up so miners switch to bch for a min then switch back when its less profitable again.

No problemo
