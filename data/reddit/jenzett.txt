So what about all the transactions in the bitcoin network that don't go through? Seems to me like you would then also be stuck in your wallet, if you want to sell them.

I mean... In the golden days if the Roman empire their silver coin was super stable for hundreds of years. And you had to work two days per year to make taxes. But then they started creating more and more money to pay for their welfare state and foreign mercenaries and the money became worthless quickly. And then the mercenaries demanded to be paid in Gold. At some point even the state did not accept their own issued currency anymore and had citizens pay their tax in Gold.
A similar thing is probably already happening. Every state is creating tons of money, to keep their welfare states and economies running, which is unsustainable. But one the system crashes they need some other hard currency as taxes to prevent uprisings and civil wars. So they will turn to values which are not easily corruptible. So Gold (but not many people have it anymore) and Crypto. Venezuela is pretty much doing that right now. Other states will follow. Some will do it early enough to enable a smooth transition (Japan springs to mind) and get rid of their fiat debt through devaluing it at the same time. Once they adapted the state has to be fiscally responsible though, since they cannot just print more money. Which is probably a very good thing. But many states will not do it for this reason, cling to their failing fiat systems and crash. In the ensuring chaos they will probably accept cryptocurrencies like Venezuela now, but it will be to late.
From.the ashes new states may rise with cryptocurrencies as value exchange systems which politics cannot taint and exploit. Maybe that was Nakamotos vision.

Fiat currency doesn't hold its value either. So that is not really a point against Bitcoin. Yes right now the fluctuations are bigger, but that is because it grows so much and is being adapted as universally accepted currency in many huge markets (Japan, India).
Once it has grown to be accepted in most countries of the world, it is big enough to be relatively stable and people will actually use it for money instead of waiting for the to become more valuable.

And you think the Dollar's valur is not subject to the markets' influences? Or manipulation, say by a federal reserve bank? As long as something is representing a value, it can be used as currency. The Dollar's value e.g. usually does not change that much in the short term because it's a huge system. Still it can be a problem for people exporting goods, if the value changes in the time it takes to develop and produce a product... Same with bitcoins obviously. If it is better to have the monetary system completely uncontrolled by the political elite or not, will be seen in the future. Banks screwing up and bring save by huge expansion of the fiat currency production will not be possible anymore. Also the system cannot be easily adapted to an increase in production of products, resulting in deflation (especially bitcoins with their limited supply). Ethereum on the other hand could probably do it in a self regulating way to some extent.

Technical Analysis does not make anything possible. There may be minimal correlation, since a lot of people believe in it and therefore trade according to its principles. And if many people do it, you can be sure banks are there in the end, cashing out. They just have to wait for a strong pattern to emerge because of people acting similarly due to their beliefs in patterns... And then you can use your buying power to break the pattern... There are a lot of possibilities for someone with a lot of information and buying power.

Greenspan too. His free money fucking up the housing market and creating a huge financial crisis just shows that the government should not meddle with the currency...

The meme economy is strong now. May be a bubble forming though. The demand for Pepes has been pretty sluggish lately. No matter how rare.

Yes but bitcoin also became very slow and people were worried about the network not being able to handle it, hardforks and miners to being able to agree how to prepare for the future.
Ether also has a lot of future potential for many smart economy use cases.
But in the end I would expect both to go up a lot and the current drop is just a huge panic sale for no reason.

Why is that?

Pay higher fees and I may as well do a bank transfer or use western union.
