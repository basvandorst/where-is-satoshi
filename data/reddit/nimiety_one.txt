Well it's a Visa enterprise, and to verify/sign up you have to use [Coinbase]( and link a bank account as well as provide your ~~SSN~~ Drivers License/other form of legal ID (SSN required if ID verification fails) so if you're not looking to pay taxes on bitcoin or anything similar this isn't the service for you. 
(some one feel free to chime in if I'm wrong, went through the signup process months ago and haven't read up on any changes)
Edit: Edited for correct info.

If they have issues with the uploaded ID information you provide it can ask for the SSN, yes. 
I'll edit the comment to clarify.

Same, I was looking into using the Shift card but with all of this it makes me cautious.

Here's the video this is based on: 
Basically honey badgers don't give a fuck and do whatever they want regardless of what's going on around them ("Bitcoin it dead!1!1!!1").

I haven't made the jump yet but that's similar to what I was looking to use it for, thanks for sharing!

Do you use it for everything or just with a portion of your budget? Do you keep your coins offsite and move over what you want to spend or are you fully integrated into Coinbase?

Really love these charity donations, good exposure for the currency too! 
Hi!

This is really neat, I like to follow the Bitcoin news on and off but this seems really worthwhile; definitely going to look into picking one up!

User over on r/Linux has it working on his Nexus 5 alongside Android and Sailfish.

Not everyone likes Coinbase, I personally stopped looking once I realized depositing/getting the card was more along the standard lines of a normal bank card: 
ID, SSN, bank account, and then have to wait for depositing and the like. The nice part of Bitcoin for me was the speed of transactions, so that card didn't cut it during the setup process. 
It's a good deal for a lot of other people though, especially as the USA has very limited options atm (most of the other ones listed only work overseas iirc).

The Nexus 5 works with it apparently, some users have mentioned trying out the OS alongside Sailfish and Android.
