It does require a password on the mobile app if you enable a second password from the website.

Is it easier to understand if it's referred to as a "cloud-based BitTorrent client?" I'm going to attempt an integration with Mega soon. This would allow you to quickly import your content into your Mega account, taking advantage of their encryption systems. With this scenario, you could use SwarmStream as a BitTorrent client for your Mega account. Is that easy to grasp? And would you find that useful?

Thanks, I'll add it.

Thanks for the suggestion; it's on my to-do list.

The service isn't just for enhancing privacy. For example, I travel and use shared internet often. Downloading torrents over such a connection would be very inconsiderate. Using SwarmStream to retrieve and then stream media is a great alternative. And in locations with slow internet speeds, you can be watching a video within seconds whereas torrenting locally could take much longer.
Also, please note the **fees have been reduced**. ;)

Yes, much like put.io. I don't believe they ever accepted bitcoin, but I could be wrong.

If the Bitcoin experiment becomes a huge success, WikiLeaks could turn into an extremely wealthy media organization. How's that for some bad financial embargo karma?
