People think that bitcoin is a bubble because it’s price has increased astronomically while its utility has only increased marginally.

Indeed but if that were the case I’d expect some other measure to be increasing astronomically.

While I don't agree with every military action taken by the U.S., I do recognize the world would be a much worse place without it.

Right, because the US is ultimately responsible for every wrong performed by a government actor &lt;/sarcasm&gt;.  Aid is a powerful to move dictators in the right direction or keep them from going off the rails.  The irony is that most criticize U.S. foreign policy for being interventionist, however in the past 15 years we've taken part in bringing three dictators down and worked towards establishing democracies (which btw can be just as repressive to minorities) as dictatorships.  
Back to my original point -- the world is in a better place because the U.S. exists in every objective measure.

Right, because one book from an unreliable narrator can capture the nuance of the most complex and difficult decisions facing a superpower.  
European colonialism fucked this world up, not the U.S.  See the Middle East, Central and Southern America and Africa for dozens of examples. Who else can keep these nations of various ethnic groups that European nations pit against each other?  The U.S. is just dealing with the mess that they made and doing the best it can given the circumstances.

Sure, but given a competitive market for currencies why would you choose to consume using a currency that is generally supposed to rise in value?   Isn’t the rational behavior to spend inflationary currencies and save deflationary ones?

OPEC is responsible for roughly half of the world's crude production, and 80% of its reserves, sells its crude in USD.  This is an organization certainly working against U.S. interests, for the most part, as it limits oil exports of member nations.  This results in higher oil prices.

Half of the arabic world is experiencing civil unrest, civil wars, or the overthrow of the current government.  It seems far more likely that this is the cause of the upheaval in Libya, not some CIA conspiracy.  
Frankly, (like most conspiracy theories), this one makes no sense.  Had the CIA been involved, the U.S. government would have came out instantly for the rebels. Instead the government waffled and made vague statements about avoiding civilian casualties.  Sarkozy had to convince Obama that the U.S. should get involved militarily.   
Moving to some gold based currency is absurd.  Africa produces 3B barrels of oil per year, which at current prices is about $270B per year.  Africa wouldn't be able to coin enough currency to pay for their own oil.

If you are going to tax investment income (which most will agree is a good thing), you pretty much have to know the investments of the individual.  
So if you'd like to equate taxes with loss of privacy, go for it.  However very few people pay taxes when they don't think they'll get caught...

What settings are you referring to?  I don't typically configure devices in my Diablo parameters -- I allow it to use all of the devices on the machine.  It seems configured correctly, since it correctly adds cypress  and 2.  My display env variable is set to :0.

Russia is a historical enemy of the U.S, and frequently opposes U.S. foreign policy.  Putin certainly did his fair share of sabre rattling, despite a relatively friendly Bush administration.  Regardless, high prices are bad thing for the U.S. economy and anything that is bad for the economy is probably bad politically.  


No, of course not, but it does make sure that Oil prices are above market values.  Much like their unwitting positive impact on the USD, intentions are meaningless in this discussion.  


Like building their nuclear facilities under mountains?  If they've got nothing to hide, they should embrace inspections (they haven't), and avoid making their nuclear facilities underneath mountains.  
The economics of civilian nuclear power simply aren't their in Iran either, considering they live in a nation that has copious fossil fuels.  
They've also got quite the rocket program, despite not sharing a border with any nation that might conceivably represent a military threat.  
Sure they may be developing for peaceful purposes, but I wouldn't bet a dime on it given ten million to one odds.  I think most of the world agrees with me.

So I'm fairly convinced that I have a hardware issue.  BAMT has a kernel panic on boot when booting from the flash drive.  I ran memtest successfully, without errors for about 45 minutes.  Considering I run into problems very quickly, I think we can probably eliminate memory as my problem.  I've never seen a processor that sort of works though.

So OPEC keeps the price of oil -- the single most critical commodity maintaining the U.S. economy high, thus damaging economic growth and single handily keeping an account deficit for the U.S.  While enriching nations like Iran, and Russia.  This serves the U.S. how?  
OPEC chose the USD not out of conspiracy -- they chose it because at the time it was far and away the most stable currency. The U.S. government chose a strong dollar policy, bolstering the value to attract investment.  
The option of changing the currency might have made sense 5 years ago, as the USD was dropping and the Euro was increasing in value.  However the Euro which is under considerable uncertainty  due to the welfare states that can't pay their debts.
A gold standard?  There isn't enough liquidity in the gold market to support the incredible amount demand for oil.   
Go buy yourself a foil hat.

Funny, because I'd say that article is a great example of confirmation bias, as are many of your comments.  The U.S. barely maintains embassies in most of Africa, yet we deem it worthy of military action to "maintain influence"?  It seems that it would behoove the U.S. to work within established diplomatic frameworks rather than resort so quickly military action.  


Spending money on defense hardly constitutes evidence for involvement anywhere. 
This guy's evidence that this revolution isn't built at home is the economic status of Libya.  While this is all interesting, there are also many examples of rebellions in countries and regions that are economically prosperous (or at least middling, see the American Revolution for a great example).  Bahrain is a modern example ( GDP per capita &gt;$26k).
I'm simply cynical of those that are quick to think the U.S. is responsible for everything.  There is no evidence whatsoever that the U.S. is responsible for any of these civil wars, and if your article proves anything, it is that the U.S. is really quite bad at covering up such evidence.  
I have no doubt that the CIA is currently involved with Libya.  It is quite sensible that the U.S. provide advice and intelligence to the rebels.   I simply don't see any evidence that supports the assertion that the CIA was involved in fomenting the revolution.  Unless you consider speculation from a Russian news site to be "evidence".

Iran has built their nuclear program and military on the backs of their oil wealth, and hates the United States. 


A weaker currency would benefit the U.S. in a large number of ways, especially in exports and manufacturing.  My point here is that the U.S. loses a lot more from OPEC than it gains.  I think I've made that point quite well.  


If aren't aware of the Greek debt crisis, the coming debt crisis in Portugal, Spain and Ireland, then you aren't informed enough to have this discussion.  If you aren't aware of the consequences of potential defaults, or even the bail outs on the Euro, you aren't informed enough to have this discussion.  Anyway, you've not sourced a single assertion you've made, yet you are quick to demand sources of mine.  I consider you a time-waster.
