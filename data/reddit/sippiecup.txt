I meant in terms of what you can build with gold. Its used as circuit board contacts, in medicine, telescopes, etc. 
Bitcoin has applications in the virtual space, but you can't fill a person's teeth with it.

Thats an interesting question. If you want a more in-depth answer, you can listen to this [Planet Money]( podcast.
If you want a shorter answer, because of innovation in inventing replacements as well as a shift to a much more efficient global economy which brought the price of all metals down, even as scarcity increases. 
For example: copper pipes used to be the only piping used in your home, now it is very common to see plastics take over much of the role that copper had in construction. This led to decreased demand for copper, and thus, lower costs.
When it comes to the global economy, Africa being able to actually mine the valuable minerals such as silver, gold, copper, and tungsten has allowed for increased supply of these minerals and at a cheaper cost to mine, leading to further declines in price.
If one day someone decides its time for a nuclear winter. Even though money is worthless, you will always be able to use the copper pipes to make some tools to survive. Whereas your bitcoins are worthless.
But the real risk is if one day everyone decides bitcoin is dumb (impossible), or something catastrophic like a 51% attack happening and everyone losing trust in bitcoin (unlikely of course). The bitcoins in your wallet will not have any value anymore.
I'm not saying bitcoin is bad, I am just pointing out why the gold standard existed before, and why metals differ from bitcoin as an asset.

I picked up my rescue from a petco, mostlhy because the pupper would be more receptive to meeting me in a place outside of the rescue.

"Lets allow and support for blatantly illegal activity to take place because it helps the blockchain" sounds like a good strategy for litecoin.
If a much larger botnet, like Srizbi or Rustock were to do this, I bet you would change your tune pretty quickly. It can easily take over ~90% of the hashing power and would probably be the only ones minting coins. To put it in perspective, these botnets have about half a million computers. Even if each computer only did 1000 hashes a second, it would still be the biggest miner of LTC.
@_date: 2014-01-14 18:20:43
eh.. Theres a botnet that keeps popping up on wemineltc. It has increased the difficulty by 20% in the past few weeks.

Which is still irrelevant to the argument I am making. 
My point is that gold has a unique place in our economy that has no substitute good. Bitcoin on the other hand, can be substituted. 
@_date: 2016-01-07 00:15:03




The gold standard.




My arguement is that gold has more inherent value as a **resource**. In which it can rely on to always have value even in a cataclysmic event. Say theres a nuclear holocaust. 
Will bitcoins benefit you at all in post apocalyptic society? No. 
Will Gold benefit you at all in post apocalyptic society? Yes.
From a RESOURCE standpoint Bitcoin is purely a distributed ledger, many other applications can easily duplicate this perfectly. Hell the same application on a different blockchain can. People argue on this subreddit that bitcoinXT is a completely different coin, yet it is posed to take over the bitcoin blockchain. If BitcoinXT is fully adopted, it'll prove that the "bitcoin" userbase can, and will, adopt the best blockchain for the job. Currently and historically that has been bitcoin, but you cannot say it will stay that way forever.
As purely a resource, gold has certain characteristics that are not found in any other resources, which makes it more useful. For example, you cannot use copper to fill your teeth because it'll drastically change the pH level of your mouth. Gold is one of the few resources that you can use without adverse affects, nothing will ever change that.


Just did. but okay, Copper cannot replace gold on any of those, mostly because it can tarnish and have its properties changed dramatically. Thats why gold is used instead. (really you should have picked silver as it is better than copper but worse than gold, but whatever) 


You really dont understand how some things do jobs better than others. Not to mention that bringing up sillicon as a subsitute for copper and gold shows your lack of understanding of basic physics.


Unfortunately 99.999999999999999% of the world's population doesn't share your opinion. Especally since the power and utility of a distributed ledger can be easily rocked by corruption or just boatloads of money (51% attacks, sustained DDoS &amp; other exploits), and not just the world as we know it ending.
@_date: 2016-01-06 23:03:34
I am talking about gold as a resource, which you equated bitcoin to also being. I did not say it was a currency. That being said, until the gold standard was dropped, literally every transaction in the world "used gold for a transaction." So it has a pretty good track record of keeping its value.
Bitcoin can be easily replaced with another coin. Gold cannot be replaced with another resource. Gold is never valueless, that just shows you are ignorant to what is being stated.
off the top of my head gold can be used in: 
- Medicine
- Construction
- Aerospace
- Microbiology
- Physics research
- Semiconductors
- jewelry
@_date: 2016-01-06 22:54:54
Gold as a resource cannot be easily replaced with another resource and have it perform nearly as well.
Bitcoin, hypothetically, could be replaced by another distributed ledger (litecoin, dogecoin, non-blockchain based) without much loss.

The numbers are [74% and 26%]( Why lie about something like that?
As a stablecoin which is supposed to be pegged at the dollar, this means that bitcoin is essentially backing itself. meaning if you want to look a tether for purely fiat currency, it's only $0.76 cents, but its trading as if it was $1, leading to the bitcoin price inflation.
@_date: 2019-08-14 17:54:38
And no when banks do it, it is not okay.
But banks are not manipulating bitcoin, bitfinex is. You are just deflecting.

How is it their job to put a spin on it?
The reason why they bring up bitcoin is because that's how they caught most of the people. 
People bought bitcoin off coinbase after registering an account with their passport and xferred from their coinbase wallet straight to the website.
If you think the FBI  isn't going to check if the bitcoin wallets belong to coinbase customers,then I have no words...
@_date: 2019-08-14 16:26:26


Please read the link i posted.. Bitfinex has 24% of the value of tether, which is a pegged-to-the-dollar stablecoin, backed with bitcoin.
Tether is backed, not bitcoin.
But when Tether drives the price of bitcoin, it is essentially bitcoin backing itself with its own value.
speculation of bitcoin also isn't bad, but speculation of tether is bad since its a "stablecoin."
Bitfenix, by not 100% backing tether with USD, while still pegging its value at $1, means that they can manipulate the price of bitcoin, and the "value" of tether to extract money out of the ecosystem. That's the issue I have.
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:32:35
I'm not talking about bank loans...
I'm talking about how tether is being issued and spent as a $1 stablecoin without being fully backed by the dollar, and how bitfinex uses that to purchase bitcoins as if it were equal to $1 and manipulating the market with the ambiguity of tether's value.
They spend $0.76 cents for every $1 spent when buying bitcoin. How is that not manipulation?
@_date: 2019-08-14 15:57:46
I just deleted my post because I realize it will go no where discussing this with you and just waste hours of my time. However, since you decided to respond, I'd do so as well. My original post was exactly what you quoted "So the price is based on speculation of what it is worth to an individual, and nothing backing it?"
That said, the point of the argument is that it is inherently circular. Bitcoin "as a store of value" has no use other than being "bitcoin" and its value is attributed purely from speculation.
The watermelon on the other hand, has an inherent value of something that you can eat, and get (albeit not much) nutrition from. Thus, in an apocalyptic scenario, the watermelon has more "value" to you, than a bitcoin will. 


Now if they both value that at $100k, and Alice decides to pay Bob in 100,000 USDT, how much USD does Bob now have?
Currently, if he sold all of it, he would get $100,000 USD. However, if we reverse your situation, and have the price of bitcoin suddenly goes down to $0, everyone who is holding USDT and tries to transfer their USDT to USD, would only get $0.76. 
Thus, Bob would only get $76,000 USD.
This is what i mean by Bitcoin backing itself in regards to tether. and as bitcoin increases in value, the amount of bitcoin needed to back USDT decreases. Allowing for bitfinex to extract fiat money out of the bitcoin environment through the shifting value of USDT, or adjust the amount of USD that is backing tether.
Bitcoin itself isn't an issue, Tether is.
@_date: 2019-08-14 22:42:43
Except the assets they have are bitcoin, thus the phrase "bitcoin backing itself".
Furthermore, because of the fluidity of change with bitcoin's value, the amount of bitcoins being used to "back" tether is changing every second. Thus, we are able to use these fluctuations in tether's value to issue more when it is convenient for them, and redeclare the value of tether at any time.
If you are manipulating the value of tether and the amounts being issued, you can manipulate the price of bitcoin.
Its no coincidence that every new issuance of tether results in the price of bitcoin spiking.
Once again, my issue is that a $1 stable coin, which when first released and in its release statement was to be 100% backed by the dollar no less, is not backed by the dollar.
Its gone beyond making things easier for their accountants, to straight up fraud.

No. I'm one of the people that use common sense and know how bitcoin works. If you want an anon transaction, use zcash or something that is private.

Then don't use bitcoin for the stuff you want hidden. I don't really see an issue with using multiple forms of payments.

First, it's "they already sent updated numbers"
Second, They didn't. Please cite a source.


You don't understand the english language, so its hard to really understand what you are trying to say.
Tether is 24% backed with bitcoin. If it is what is being used to purchase and sell bitcoin, then you have 24% of every transaction being bitcoin backing itself.
You have no understanding of any monetary theory if you don't understand that. The USD is also backed by itself, but has the support of the U.S. Economy, and now global economy so people won't lose confidence in it.
Bitcoin does not have that ability. It is backed by the dollar, similar to how the U.S. was backed by the gold standard. 
As soon as you start trading tether, worth .76 cents, as if it was a dollar, you are using bitcoin's value to back itself, with nothing of worth other than speculation to say what the value of bitcoin is.

That being said if you have regenerative braking on standard then you really never need to touch the brake unless its a hard stop as the accelerator acts as a "desired speed" button more than an accelerator, if you bring it down to the level that makes you go MPH 60 and then bring it half way up it will apply the regenerative brakes until you are going 30 and then cruise at that speed.
