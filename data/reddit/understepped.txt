Now we just need that Roubini guy to say crypto is the future and Roger to admit that Bitcoin is real Bitcoin.

If everyone holds, there are no sellers. And there are always new buyers. So... yeah...

There just isn’t that much of useful information to post every day. Memes, on the other hand, have no such limitation.

Several countries combined, huh? Can you share the source of that?

They are taking it incredibly seriously, what a relief.

People who depend on their religious leaders to tell them if they can use crypto are not going to break free anytime soon.

At least new ones aren’t gonna pop up as much as they used to, claiming they are the new and better btc/eth/whatever else.

And this happens every time price suddenly moves in any direction, people start selling/buying/withdrawing.

Let’s just hope the mempool doesn’t get as clogged as it did last time everyone got excited.
@_date: 2018-10-15 10:55:06
can we please stop re-re-re-reposting this shit already?
@_date: 2018-10-15 12:09:54
Those are the obvious places and have been already swept repeatedly during previous bullrunns. If you want to find some bitcoins, you gotta be more creative.

Saying “If you’re like me, you don’t know how it works” at the very beginning of the video which is supposed to explain how it works is kinda... you know...

I keep all my bitcoin on my iphone, in Mycelium wallet. I memorized my 12-word seed phrase, so if something happens to my phone, I can recover everything without a problem. Why do people need hardware wallets? What could go wrong?
@_date: 2019-10-07 14:36:07
I have about 3 btc inside at the moment. I don’t install any programs except the bare essentials. As far as I know IOS doesn’t easily get “infected”. I mean, it does sound stupid at a first glance to keep so much money pn the phone, but what’s the worst-case scenario here?
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:24:00
And that, my friend, is a prime example of confirmation bias.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:44:26
I just pointed out that criticizing them is like beating a dead horse. They already lost and everyone knows it. Let them struggle a little more and die in infamy. You constantly raising the topic makes it look like there is something to discuss here. Well, there isn’t anymore. Hope that was clear enogh.
@_date: 2019-02-21 20:31:33
I wonder why there’s not a word anywhere, including the article, that while tx amount is near its ATH, it’s also coming to its limit. There are already 10-20k unconfirmed transactions in the mempool. What happens when we see 20% increase in usage? LN isn’t ready to handle it right now. Seems like everyone is just waiting for an inevitable repeat of last year’s disaster...
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:49:00
Market is just doing it’s thing as usual, going up and down pretty much without any discernible pattern, but since it’s close to some arbitrary number (3000 eur in your case), which looks meaningful to you, you assume that there is something deeper going on here. Didn’t meen any disrespect, just looks that way to me.
@_date: 2019-02-18 16:28:09
Dude, give it up already. Your obsession with bch just makes you look insecure. They picked the wrong side of the bet and going to pay for it soon enough.
@_date: 2019-02-18 23:06:38
Those Bitcoin and Cash are dangerously close in a sentence.
@_date: 2019-06-22 22:13:04
Since the buys cause the rise.
It would be natural to assume...

Even when it dropped to 16 from 18. Sounds like some major ponzi propaganda. Especially to outsiders. I don’t think bitcoin needs this kind of FOMOinduction to thrive.
@_date: 2019-02-22 18:20:33
LN can handle millions of transactions, and I have no doubt about it. But not today. In a year maybe. It is not ready for everyday use by average person, I hope there is also no doubt about this fact. But increase in usage will happen much earlier than in 1 year. Thus we have a problem I described, or don’t we?
@_date: 2019-04-02 08:08:30
I used to wonder the same thing. how can every coin simultaneously gain/lose 10% of its value. Then I heard a theory that evey altcoin is pegged to bitcoin, so if price of btc changes - so does the price of everything else.

No one is trying to instill fear and doubt. People are just having fun at the expense of those who are loosing money. They don’t have any hidden agenda. Most of them, anyway. I don’t think banning those people and deleting their comments is the right response here. It just makes us look insecure.

Transfering huge sums is done on-chain, LN is not suited for this purpose.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:40:24
How can making LN fully functional and user-friendly take SO LONG? I mean, there are a lot of people working full-time on it, right? And there is a huge incentive to make it operational as soon as possible. I just can’t imagine years of effort of so many people going into it.

It’s not like the price is going to 5x from now till the day of an event, and then fall abruptly the next day.  The closer it gets, the clearer is the picture of what’s gonna happen, don’t obsess about it now.

It’s just an exception that proves the rule. 99% of completely useless shit will never die. They just go under 0,01$ price range, but they’re still out there.

I don’t see anything wrong with hot wallets per se. I live alone, have SSD and 0% chance of getting any kind of virus/malware. So hot wallet works just fine for me, even for substantial amounts.
