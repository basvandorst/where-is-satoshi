Uhh, no? I'm up thousands of imaginary dollars.

I cannot remember the name of the program I downloaded, so I don't know what to search for. I also delete my usernames when my karma score gets too high, so there's no history to look through there, either. Maybe the name of the program will come to me when I am not thinking about it.

I don't know if I am smart enough to understand this.

I have the wallet file. Oh, and I guess I could find the address in my CB history. But, wouldn't the receive addresses of BTC and BTC be different?
EDIT: yeah, I have the receive address of where I sent my BTC on July 31.

But I thought BitcoinUnlimited was a dual-wallet. Why wouldn't it show both BTC and BCH at the same time? It's not like logging into CB and seeing my accounts all at once?
Thanks for the continuing replies.

Check out the reply below this.

I didn't notice any other currencies listed in the desktop wallet at the time. How would BCH not have been visible if I could see my BTC?
I still have the wallet.dat file (really thought I had deleted it--why would I have needed to keep an empty wallet file? Some part of me must have thought why care about freeing up 88 kb of data?), but I can't seem to remember the name of the program I downloaded.
EDIT: Oh, the name of the program is BitcoinUnlimited (accidentally double-clicked the wallet file and the name came up--accident is the mother of knowledge!) I am on a strict wifi data limit for the next three weeks, so downloading 12+ GB of blockchain history is going to have to wait until I fly to my next country.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:25:06
Right, I figured as much. But when my BTC finally showed up, I didn't see any BCH.

I was poking fun at myself. Hope you didn't think I meant you.

You misunderstood my point. I said I delete my username when my karma gets too high, *because* I don't like high karma.


I waited until I went on vacation, and let my laptop run for six or eight days while it downloaded the entire blockchain history, and then one morning when I woke up... there was my coin. I transferred it back to CB, and now... well, it's somewhere where if I mention it, I'll probably take a lot of shit for it, so I'll just keep that to myself.

I guess I can try downloading the blockchain history again in three weeks when I leave India and return to Thailand. Do I remember my password, though? I think so. I'll almost certainly be back here asking for advice on what to do.

Before the fork, but the blockchain history had not finished downloading to my computer before August 1. Not sure if that makes a difference.

Jesusfuckingchrist. How about: "similar to"?
@_date: 2018-01-15 13:44:06
It doesn't show on my CB dashboard.
