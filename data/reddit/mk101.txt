The major problem is the heating, cooling, re-heating cycle that the card will inevitably go through. This causes strain on weak solder joints as they expand and contract. Since you said you not using a mining rig, I'm guessing you computer will be turned on and off quite frequently. So it will probably reduce the lifespan, but no more than if you were playing video games that heated the card to the same temp and then let it cool down again. My card runs like 1 or 2 degrees hotter when mining (62-63C) than when I'm playing something graphic-intensive(60-61C)
At least I think this is how it works.
