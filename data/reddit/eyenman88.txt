Bull run will definitely come. 
The bears will still be in control as long as we are willing to sell.
For me, its a no trade zone now in terms of selling, too oversold already. HODL guys!

Investing in Bitcoin is nuts!
Gotta have balls to be in crypto.

Rocket has taken off without him �� 
I can totally empathise his feeling of FOMO.
Get in when it crashes/corrects! ��

I apologize if you had already clarified in previous comments and I’d missed.
But, my question is, if the court decides to sell the remaining 160k BTC and remaining BCH for fiat, do you know if they will sell it on exchange?
The amounts that have been sold thus far for creditors have collapsed the crypto market and impeded the progress of crypto and widespread implementation of blockchain technology as it burnt many new investors who came in late 2017.
Would you know how they would normally sell remaining assets in Japan in bankruptcy cases? If you have a choice, please sell them off exchange!
Really appreciate you taking the time to reply to so many questions and endeavors to paying creditors the money they had lost. I can understand you’ve had a rough time yourself, but doing things right for the crypto community and investors who were affected by the collapse of Mt Gox, would right a lot of wrongs and hopefully bit more peace with your conscience. ��
