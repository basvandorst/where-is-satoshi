This would be ideal anywhere free WiFi is currently NOT available. In the town where I live, there are only a few cafe's that offer open WiFi, but a ton of potential connections by the residents living nearby. An enterprising person could offer WiFi to downtown visitors covering areas not reached by the free cafe hotspots.

"Every system in nature is hierarchical. Contrary to anarchist / communist/capitalist/ libertarian utopias, hierarchy is the way the universe is programmed to operate under."
No, it's the opposite.

Why were you doing business with the criminals at Chase in the first place? Use a credit union -- they don't give a damn if you have a Coinbase acct.

Yeah, saw that earlier. I get the impression the author doesn't understand MSC's capabilities or implications. There was a great discussion about it on LTB the other week.

I'm sure the Federal Reserve Bank would greatly appreciate these efforts on their behalf. Altcoiners, not so much.

Your example is not why I'm calling them a monopoly. And if you were honest about who deserves recognition for the creation of the mobile phone, it wasn't Apple. It was the ham radio community. So get over your petty brandism.
@_date: 2013-12-29 08:01:16
"Pretty much was"... that's reassuring. I did the research and it's not a pre-mine -- it was a publicly-announced launch. 
Then again, there's Satoshi's pre-mined 950,000 BTC wallet. So Bitcoin is a pre-mine. Disappointed?

I think it sucks that they take money out of your bank account and you don't get the BTCs for 4 or 5 days later. Living off the "float" if you ask me and a very questionable business practice. I think I'll switch to CashIntoCoins next time.

You have some proof to back up such an assertion?
@_date: 2013-12-28 06:12:04
No. It was a fair launch. Sorry you missed the boat.

The altcoin that wins over bitcoin is the one with much faster confirmation times for large-value purchases AND that has more adopters in the retail marketspace. Bitcoins slow conf time for big ticket items could be its undoing.

Yes, got 'em. Thanks Will. Great service even when things are hectic and you're running behind. +100 All the best!
@_date: 2013-12-24 04:20:36
Right. Keep perpetuating it via the vote. Makes perfect sense.
@_date: 2013-11-19 16:52:07
CashIntoCoins.com  Will Wheeler is awesome and gets right back to you via email if you have questions, even during buying crunches. Can't say that about Coinbase which also requires 4-day ACH transfers initially and then you still don't get your BTCs for an additional two days.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:13:04
It started because a bunch of peeps only just recently heard about it. This does not make Quark a "pump and dump"... Quark's devs were free to design their coin any way they wished to because open source allows them to. The project was released publicly in July and open to anyone to mine via CPU. All this whining and complaining is just a bunch of sour grapes by those who missed the mining boat. If they want to complain about true pre-mines and scams, they should focus on NXT... a central bank's dream come true.

Transition? Gradual? Government only gets incrementally WORSE over time, not better. This is the story of every empire. Please show me an example of one that got better an gave "its" people MORE freedom over time.
Left to me, I wouldn't participate. Where's the moral legitimacy of 51% being able to point their guns at the 49%? There is none. All violence is illegitimate... voting included.
You stop legitimized violence by refusing to give it your stamp of approval at the ballot box, no matter how dressed up in technology it is.
Peace on Earth starts with YOU.
@_date: 2013-12-29 07:56:04
Ah, so that doesn't make Quark "pre-mined", it just means people were late to the game. Big difference. In 30 years I guess peeps will call Bitcoin "pre-mined" using this same logic. And are you forgetting Satoshi's pre-mined 950K BTC wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:02:22
Even during the crunch, Will delivered. A+++ service. I highly recommend CashIntoCoins for purchasing BTCs. Why pay the LocalBitcoins premium???

Yes, and gold is the purported long-term storage of value. Perhaps the decline is due to movers from gold to BTC. No way to prove it, but that would be interesting.

No, Quark was not pre-mined. It is fast-mined though and had a fair launch.
