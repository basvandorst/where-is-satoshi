You will not be accepted because you're not a local. And if you're white, then you'll be downright harassed on a regular basis. South Pacific islands are notoriously poor, Palau is no exception. Theft and robbery will be rampant. Electricity will be very expensive (albeit the locals don't care because they'll hang out doing nothing in the no-air-conditioned shade all day every day). Finally, once you get there it will be very difficult and expensive to leave/travel anywhere else.

0.18% seems like a rather high figure for ownership. Surprising (to me), if accurate.

Just came across your post from 2 months ago- I am in the exact same situation. Did you find a work-around for verification while overseas?

As someone who has lived on a pacific island- you really need to visit Palau before you go this far into making plans. It will not be what you think it is.

Buffett famously says he doesn't invest in tech stocks because he doesn't understand them- and he sticks to what he knows. You don't have to know everything to be rich, you only have to know one thing really well and invest in it (his quote). 
He's brilliant but he admits he doesn't understand cryptos.

I’d like to buy coffee/snacks with bitcoin. So smallest payment of $1 would be good. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 00:56:28
$0.10 would be huge for a small transaction though 
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:01:48
Why would I use money when I should be using bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:23:28
No.... gold is used as a hedge against stocks and bonds. Are you saying people will stop hedging against stocks and bonds? That makes no sense. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 09:03:13
So if that happens then bitcoin will be bought/sold hundreds of thousands of times per day and transaction fees will skyrocket to levels we have never seen. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 06:40:21
That’s boring and has little utility. That makes it the same thing as gold. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 07:14:57
Gold is bought and sold a hell of a lot more than bitcoin. That 0.10 is going to explode if it hits the market cap of gold. 
@_date: 2018-10-16 05:51:50
Why is bitcoin useful if you can’t use it for everyday purchases?
@_date: 2018-03-27 22:18:13


That’s not how courts work. You pursue all charges when the state is involved. 
Innocent until proven guilty. He was never charged with murder and the state never tried him on it (which is highly suspicious). To say he did it would be factually incorrect. No evidence. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 01:25:21
Same, feels good (or maybe not, we'll see)
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:31:43
Why do the transcripts matter? He was never convicted of the crime.
If I’m in court charging someone for running into my car, and I tell the judge “he was on drugs!” Would you expect the guy to be convicted of a DWI on the spot? Of course not. You need a separate trial to show guilt of that. 
Edit: I just read the section of the transcripts. It just says there is “ample evidence... that is clear and unambiguous”. That just means there’s evidence it happened, but not proof. To show proof you’d need to show guilt. So that brings up the question- if the evidence was good, why didn’t they bring up another charge and convict him of conspiracy to murder? 
@_date: 2018-03-02 07:09:41
I had a great time but there are certainly many challenges that most people never consider. It’s worth considering those and I think I laid them out pretty well. I’ve never been to Palau maybe you’re right that’s it’s different.

Since were on new posts by famous bitcoin developers and early adopters- here is a post by Wei Dai from two weeks ago. He only posts 1-3 times per year so it’s not too common.

If bitcoin reaches the market cap of gold (which is about the best case scenario we could imagine), you would see about a 50x increase (bitcoin market cap is 150 billion and global Gold is 7.8 trillion). That’s best case scenario imo. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:10:49
If this allows the market to grow and better represents the global price for BTC, then it would be an improvement, in a sense. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 05:20:18
Theoretically if you owned every bitcoin it would be worth $0 because nobody would be buying/selling it or spending/saving it.

Lots of evidence that the hitman stuff was forged. I’m not convinced he ever did it. But the DEA needed to connect him with a direct violent crime to get the kind of funding they wanted for further dark market operations. Really really shady stuff... 
@_date: 2018-03-27 06:03:57
He never tried to hire hitmen.  No evidence of it. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 10:44:54
So the "winner" of the block is determined by more or less a lottery system? Instead of the person who computed the most?

I watched about half of the conference. Did anyone else notice how generally unprepared and haphazard the presenters looked? 
@_date: 2018-03-27 13:04:30
You’re actually very wrong, maybe you don’t understand how courts work. The charges of murder were never brought up, so he never had to defend those. The fact that the jury brought it up is really irrelevant to the case (probably irresponsible of them to assume guilt without a trial). 
If we pretend you’re correct- that would be quite a remarkable precedent if it were the first case to use anonymous emails as evidence of guilt. Remember, nobody was ever actually killed. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 03:55:23

His posts are really unique. I wish we knew more about him, he sounds like an interesting guy. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 11:55:13
Wasn't part of the sentencing set down by the judge. Same reason email correspondence is never accepted in court, because it's so easily forged. The DEA needed to link him with a direct violent crime to secure funding for more dark net operations. Maybe he did order hitmen, but theres no evidence beyond the emails which isn't credible. 
@_date: 2018-03-30 04:48:44
You can make a market to trade futures on literally anything you want. Traders wanted to trade futures on Bitcoin, so they're doing it. You bet whether the future price will be higher or lower than the current price.

It's too easy to shit on Roger. But I agree with you, it's unnecessary. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 02:43:34
It’s essentially like gold because it’s a finite resource, only you can spend anywhere in the world extremely easily, so it operates like a currency also. It’s a deflationary store of value that can be transferred from person to person extremely seamlessly. There’s really nothing like it in the world today to compare it to, I like to think of it as a hybrid between gold and money except that it’s far easier than either to move it from person to person. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 03:39:57
People are worried about scaling. $50 tx fees when it was at the top and FUD over viability of LN is keeping bitcoin down. You solve scaling and bitcoin is unstoppable. Hopefully LN is a success.

What makes you think bitcoin prices follow trendlines?

They never cared about bitcoin at all, just its relationship to fiat so they could get rich quick.

That doesn’t look like any trendlines I’ve seen with stocks. Looks like it broke down twice and broke up once in the photo you sent.  Really not relevant if you’re trading.

The rest of the world will soon follow suit. Governments aren't fighting cryptos because they know they can't stop them, instead they're going to regulate them strongly to reap the taxes (which also destroys the entire idea of a cryptocurrency). 
In my opinion its only a matter of time until anonymous crypto purchasing systems are made illegal- like ATMs that don't require photo ID, and websites like localbitcoins. They'll seize all the data from online exchanges, like they already have with coinable. Governments will track all purchases and sales so they can recover taxes.

Are you trying to make the argument that community with their hodl memes convinced large institutions and retired folks to pour money into bitcoin? Of course not. The money came in because bitcoin is a unique store of value that can be bought and sold.... and FOMO.

Why do I need to be a member of the bitcoin community and contribute to it's rise? Isn't that the opposite goal of complete decentralization? 
I just want to buy things using bitcoin. If companies want to accept my bitcoins for goods and services I will gladly trade with them. If companies don't want my bitcoins then I won't deal with them. Bitcoin grows when people think this way.

Australia has *extremely* strict policies relating to taxes. Like when Craig Wright claimed he was Satoshi, Australian SWAT police raided his home only 4 hours after he tweeted it. Trying to cash in on that tax evasion.
