There is no scarcity in cryptos. There may be a set limit for each individual crypto, but there can be unlimited forks and types.

But there is an unlimited number of forks and cryptos.

And with options trading now available, institutional investors are going to game btc hard. Its a terrible store of value.

Real money is worth what important people/organisations/countries ascribe to it. Bitcoin might be the 'people's currency', but the stakeholders that matter are not following.
Imagine being a store that accepts btc. First, someone has to pay for the $30-50 dollar transaction fee. Even then it might take hours to process. Once it has been processed, it has lost 25% of it's value.
Currency of the future.

How do you feel about this

I'd say more Chinese are investing in foreign real estate than Bitcoin to get wealth out of the country. Not saying one is better than the other, but Bitcoin use is overestimated.

Ah, the greater fool theory.

Well the chart is shaped like a mongoose with its legs spread open, so the price tomorrow should be around $500000

Public companies have assets and revenue where you can predict future cash flows. There is an [intrinsic value]( that can be determined through [fundamental analysis](

Right. But also unlike a company, bitcoin has no book value and has the potential to go to zero. Companies can have patents, real estate, and other assets that give it an intrinsic value even if it goes bankrupt.

A much more educated guess to mitigate risk. Picking a value for cryptos is a complete shot in the dark.

we're currently in a bull trap

If we’re going to make random comparisons, lets also compare it to flying cars and fusion.

Anti-establishment bitcoin needs acknowledgment from the establishment.
