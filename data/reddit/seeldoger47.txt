Are you implying that before Glass-Steagall was repealed that you owned your money at the bank? I'm having a hard time figuring out what you means because you just kinda threw it in on the end there.


Not true, assuming we are in speaking in the US context. The US is remarkable in that money creation is radically decentralized given that the money supply has been effectively privatized to the commercial lending system. The Fed controls the Federal Funds rate, over night rates, interest on excessive reserves, and the ability to determine how much excess reserves are available in the interbank market.  
Quantitative Easing is not money printing and it doesn't cause inflation, as evident by [this graph]( What is interesting about the graph is that from August 2008 to January 2009, when the Fed was embarking on it's largest asset purchasing programs, we actual saw prices fall from their relative peaks in 2008. Moreover, despite the fact that the Fed has purchased nearly [$4.2 Trillion dollars in assets]( inflation has increased only 8.7% from their nominal highs in 2008 to today, whereas the amount of excess bank reserves (this is also called base money and is a direct result of the Fed's Large Scale Asset Purchases) has increased nearly 462% over that same time period. And before you claim that the CPI is rigged, be aware that the Billion Price Project's, which is an independent project headed by MIT, calculations [corroborates  the Fed's](
