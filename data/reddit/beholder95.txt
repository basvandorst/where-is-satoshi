The original iPhone was 499 on AT&amp;T and you had to pay in full - no carrier subsidy. Adjusted for inflation that’s about $607 today. This for a 4gigabyte, 2g, low resolution, non-flash camera phone. 
I’d say the new Xr is a pretty good value phone giving even an average user a great experience. 
The XS at 1,000 is at the upper end of what a phone should cost but you pay more for the premium product that is Apple. The free market has decided and this business model seems to be working for them (points to their Trillion dollar market cap).

Its funny i Thought i was The only one doing the buy BTC every pay check... Now that I've started to accumulate a sizeable any in coinbase I'm looking at multibit or electrum to make a savings wallet or wallets. 
Anyone have issues with either if these?
My one fear is that they both rely on the proprietary servers to be up for the wallets to access block chain. Is there a way to Import these wallets into a standard block chain wallet (one that downloads the entire blockchain) should something happen to these servers or if they went permanently offline?

I would take this picture down, could be enough info for someone to reconstruct those private keys and steal whatever btc is in those wallets.

Oh I didn't know that in a pinch you could make your own electrum server and have it be the gateway between my wallet and the blockchain... I'll have to look into that!

We'll from scratch no, but since some of these keys are mostly shown that vastly increases an attackers odds of cracking

Oh I agree and honestly I want to hedge and not have all my coins in 1 basket. I got "Gox'd" so it's a good thing I didn't have much there. Was looking recently at moving to bitstamp but now there's talk of insolvency there too. I've never had trouble with coin are but for risk management reasons I want to have another option. I'll look into circle

Oh, I thought you were out of the "master of your domain" contest

Where is a good alternative to go from coin base? I've never had a problem with them but want to start looking at alternatives that work in a similar way.
