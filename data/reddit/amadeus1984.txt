Yes, on Coinbase Pro do a Stop Sell order. This will give you these boxes:
-Stop Price
-Limit Price
As one of the people who responded said, if you set one of these, if bitcoin hits the stop price, the amount of bitcoin you chose will sell at the limit price you select. Due to volatility I've been making this a $5 difference but I'm sure it's not necessary. It's worked everytime so far.
For example, I could set a Stop Sell order so that if bitcoin hits 8500, it will sell all the bitcoin I wish at the price of 8495. I hope this helps, I've personally lost a couple hundred over misunderstanding how each order type works

The 3 minute gives more detail. I tried pulling up volume on kraken but I'm unfamiliar with the exchanhe and on mobile. I believe if you go on there by default volume will be there.
I removed it so it would be more clear just how big a jump it was

I know this is old and what you said is what I'll do, but what's your experience with this during high volatility? Using the same numbers say it jumps from 5610 to 5540. I assume your order will probably be sold somewhat lower than expected.
I'm prepared to have that happen, I just want a guaranteed sell. Thanks for the help

A wash sale in itself isn't illegal, it should just be what you report. Otherwise wouldn't there be a hell of a lot of people going to jail or getting serious fines for panic selling?

Yeah I know

Ahh. I was under the impression that only long term losses could be claimed as actual losses to prevent traders from paying less by selling at the end of the year just to pick it up in the next

Wouldn't margin trading let you multiply your investment 10 or 100 times? I saw it once with a buddy who got me into btc but haven't heard much about it since

Someone coulda bought multiple lambos with that. $101 back to ~$11200. Happened over 6 minutes

So if I put the both at 5600 it will sell at that price and below? The example that I posted was what I did and it didn't trigger a few hours ago
