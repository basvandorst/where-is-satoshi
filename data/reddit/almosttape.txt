Yeah I was just thinking with a game like that having such wide appeal and using small transactions, you'd be able to familiarize a huge amount of people with the blockchain.  If that happens maybe people would be more comfortable using in regular commerce.

Pokémon Go item and Pokémon trading? I mean say what you will about the game itself, but it seems to have massive appeal across many demographics.

Did you mean 1887 perhaps?

Such currency. Many crypto. Wow.

Yeah, that probably won't happen. The market cap of Bitcoin right now is equal to about $5.6 billion. JPMorgan Chase has around $2.4 trillion worth in assets. They also have somewhere in the neighborhood of $180 billion in cash. I used to work there (at a smaller community bank now)... they have Scrooge McDuck amounts of money.

The phone is actually plugged in. He's probably at work or something. I leave my phone charging all day while I'm at the office.

Don't forget the Currency Transaction Report: 
@_date: 2014-08-17 15:37:42
Over $10,000.00 in currency, which is coin and/or paper money of any country that is designated as legal tender by the country of issuance (Currency also includes U.S. silver certificates, U.S. notes, Federal Reserve notes, and official foreign bank notes), going in or out of a bank would require a Currency Transaction Report or CTR, which is filed with FinCEN and the IRS. What gets reported is how much went in or out, your ID information on file (usually SSN or EIN and a copy of your state ID of some type like a driver license), if you made it on behalf of a person or organization, and if there was a stated purpose or source of the money. 
If a transaction over $5,000.00 in cash goes through your bank may also file a Suspicious Activity Report with FinCEN. The form is similar to the CTR. 
If a cashier's or official bank check, money order, or traveler's check is made with $3000.00 - $10000.00 in cash a MIPL is recorded. This is kept by the bank for 5 years for auditing and compliance purposes. 
It is all part of the Bank Secrecy Act and a few other related Acts you can read about here: [
Source: I used to work for Chase for several years and now work for a local community bank, both in an affluent suburb so I deal with this crap a lot.

True, but that would also violate many laws (in the police state we call America).

Actually, where I live (Ohio), it is illegal to purchase alcohol with anything other than US dollars. Which is some bullshit if you ask me.

I like Hive. I also use it on my Mac.

How do they work?

Isn't alibaba actually based in the Cayman Islands or something for accounting reasons? Something about China not allowing Chinese companies  to have non-Chinese owners.

Yeah, any suspicious activity by a customer, even just weird comments/actions, can trigger a SAR. Dollar amounts (in cash) triggering an automatic SAR vary from bank to bank depending on their policies. Generally that's $5k and up... My current employer is $7500+. I guess BoA is more strict. 
However, like some of the other comments have state, it's mostly to do with money laundering... As long as you're bringing in fiat currency to them and not doing anything shady (laundering, kiting, repeat NSFs/bouncing checks) the bank does not care if you make transfers with bitcoin exchanges. If you engage in patterns that might seem high risk, a large bank like Chase might automatically flag the account. You might be able to fight this if you are in good standing. Go into a branch and talk to the manager if this happens, it's worth a try (and be very calm and polite, you get more flies with honey). If not, try a community bank or credit union. They have actual people looking at all of this stuff and they will be a lot more understanding about things like this. I know this because I personally call everyone that opened an account at my branch who overdrafts their account or otherwise fucks something up every morning and help them fix it or at least give them until noon to come in and make it right. We constantly make exceptions so long as you're not a chronic offender and you make an effort to keep everything on the up and up.

Also how dollars only symbolize something of value while having no intrinsic value themselves, just like btc "symbolizes a digital dollar" (article's poor choice of words to describe btc)

Needs more banana. I can't get a sense of scale for this coin.

So can I just list for them all of my ISK transactions in EVE?

I love the sentiment, but the image is a bit ironic. Doesn't end so well for that guy.

Don't worry about it. $4620 is still cheap. To the moon!

That's what I did.

You spelled 'buy' wrong, brother.

I'm glad you included banana slices for scale.
