Damn straight.  If this ship were to sink to the bottom and stay there(and I don't THINK it will) I would gladly go down with it.  But then again, I didn't do anything silly like take out a loan to invest.  I can't believe anyone would do that!  Those kind of people need to stay away from bitcoin. They will end up with sob stories that will give it more bad press than it deserves.  Kind of like when stupid people drive cars too fast and wreck, own guns and fuck up, or even do drugs and get fucked.  I'm not going to pretend that the past few days haven't been crazy, they have, but you shouldn't buy bitcoin to make money.  I hope no one seriously offs themselves over this.  IT WILL GO BACK UP, PEOPLE!! Not to 260(I hope) but it will rise again.

This, and two people having a selling war on bitfloor. That shit pissees me off to no end; fighting each other to sell their .34 btc first and dropping the price dramatically.  Thankfully, that doesn't last long. Almost makes me wish there was a sidebar with a chatbox so we could yell at them. &gt;O&lt;

The banks are trying to shut us down. 
And yes, if I were going to place expendable cash into bitcoin, it would be at todays low...which should be now. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:48:07
Ahahahahahahahahaha!!!!!  Thanks for that!!! Ilol'd twice!! Literal lols. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:04:02
Yes.  Also, they are too easily manipulated by people who are good at manipulating. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:02:33
Why is it so difficult?  It's easy as pie in the USA.

Deposited almost 6.5 btc($1,000 USD) into my bitfloor acc this morning, directly from my personal wallet and the transaction has finally been confirmed at my wallet, but hasen't shown up in my Bitfloor account yet.
Is this common?
Edit:  I know they were really busy with the new system and they still hit me up in less than an hour after I contacted them and everything was fine.  I don't even think it was a problem on their end, but perhaps a lag in my system?  Not sure...I did log out and in twice and restarted my browser before contacting them. The funds were not there and then suddenly, they were!  Been looking for Roman's donation address ever since and can't find it.... 
I don't like filling up a busy man's time unecessarily.  I need to give him money to soothe my conscience!

No, but you will hear lots of laughing WHEN it goes back up.  It doesn't matter what spectators think.  People who understand bitcoin are in it b/c of principle and b/c we WANT it to work.  It's our chance to get out of a fully corrupt system and into a system we have better control over. My arms aren't tired one bit.  but then again, the cash I deposited was completely expendable.

Just WATCH and read, read, READ. Don't invest any money you can't afford to literally burn(even if it is tempting), this prevents emotional trading--which will kill profit.  After research, make a plan and stick to it.  Don't tell anyone about btc until after you've invested, then tell everyone. ;)  Simple advice, given to me(and everyone else) by the best people.  I read news stories and forum threads for almost a year before jumping in at what I thought was the right time. I went with bitfloor and I have almost tripled my investment in a month.

@_date: 2013-04-11 21:07:51
Okay, thanks, guys.  Looks like I need to get my cash in order to buy. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:55:02
Seen anything yet?  My USD ACH went from pending, to not pending(means on it's way to the bank) to pending again FIVE DAYS LATER.  I am behind Roman and Bitfloor b/c I love them, but what. the. fuck? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:47:10
I think we know the answer to that: squeaky wheel, greasy people.  :P  Just a joke, though.  It is likely the people at bitinstant are at least trying, It would be bad for business if they didn't. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:58:50
I missed something.  What are you talking about? I did find it odd that they had to mail a check. Couldn't Roman just walk in and pick up a cashier's check?  i admit I am ignorant about this, as my attorney has pointed out so kindly. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:04:00
lol  I went with bank of America to my bitfloor account when I started and it was instant, free and painless.  Have been using them ever since and haven't had any trouble.  But do your research!  No one should go into this half-cocked. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:58:21
So what about when they realize that there is no gold backing the paper money they hold?  Then what? Wallpaper?   Fires to keep us warm?  Do you even understand how btc are generated? 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:41:07
That just made me laugh. "As long as the country does well, and has a good military to ensure stability, the stock does well."  That's why our currency is shite, b/c our country has become fat and lazy through it's prosperity.   I am not saying btc will boom forever, but the USD is on it's way out,  regardless of what they say in your town.  Thanks for the laugh, though.

Not to mention that when I placed an order with bitinstant for the first time after this bitfloor mess, they bought in at the high for the day instead of the weighted average or even the last price.  I payed about 15 bucks more per coin than I should have. It was quick but WAY too expensive! I hope bitfloor can get this worked out, otherwise I am out of btc for a while. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:12:22
lol  I got a spare one.  You got a spare $250? :P 
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:58:40
BITFLOOR Forever!!!!  Deposits by Bank of America are free and almost instantanious.  Any problems I have had were addressed by Cutstomer service in UNDER AN HOUR and they didn't fault me for being an idiot. 
Viva la bitfloor!!
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:05:27
Anywhere?  lol  but seriously, bitfloor. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:58:25
And hopefully people who read and believe Yahoo and CNN won't buy in just yet.  I'd like to make some money selling when they finally decide to jump on.  I'd actually prefer it if the price would stay down for a while, then I can buy more. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 19:42:40
lol, good point.  Money management and financial responsibility 101. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:57:11
Just WATCH and READ.  Don't invest any money you can't afford to lose(even if it is tempting), this prevents emotional investing. Keep up with news stories and spread the word AFTER you invest. lol

Hey, TC! Good to see you throwing some well adjusted weight around in here.  
My ach withdrawal is once again pending. I spoke with my attorney, but didn't have much info on the details so he is looking into it and going to get back to me.  From what I was told, though, I could be fucked out of xxxx.xx, which is probably like xxx,xxx.xx to some people. 
Trying to have faith as I am a big fan of bitfloor, but no word from Roman and that is discouraging.  Good luck everyone. 
@_date: 2013-04-24 06:56:59
Well said.  i hope you're right! 
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:37:30
Not sure where you are, but: 
"Bitcoin demand has also increased, Gallippi says, because last week U.S. regulators issued the first official guidelines for private digital currencies. Prior to the regulations, the legal status of the currencies was in doubt."
 
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:08:19
yeah, me too. :/  Should have moved them to our wallets earlier.
