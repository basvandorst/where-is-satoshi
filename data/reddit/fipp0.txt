I have ordered 4 antminers L3+ from Bitmain on June! I have them all with me! I have 2 friends, one who ordered 12 and other who ordered 6! We all got them! I live in Elizabeth, NJ. And my friends lives on Brazil! We all got our orders from Bitmain. I don't know why people, tell people not to order! Same thing people here say all the time! Don't buy it, you won't make money, difficulty Will be sky rocketing, and etc. On 3 l3+ I'm making $400 per week! Without doing anything! It is good to get hands on ASIC when it is on their first because profit is way better. But I will be seeing ROI in 2 months! It is not bad at all! When you come here and read stuff, there is a bunch of people saying things, and claiming that you won't make money etc. I come to realize none of these guys saying this, have probably ever owned ASIC before on their lives! On my opinion you should get a D3! It makes way more money than L3+ does, and costs $600 dollares cheaper! Reason why D3 makes more and costs less is because Innosilicon, which is currently Bitmain rivals came out with A5 Dashmaster which doubles the power of a D3!!! And both mines Dash coin! So it broke all plan of Bitmain, to hold their D3's and control Dash difficulty! Forcing them to sell their D3's way cheaper, and faster! Gotta love competition, it will always benefits us (the costumers/consumers) INNO broke all Bitmain planns of control Dash market difficulty and batch time! Someone up there mentioned don't buy L3+ because it mines Litecoin!! Those guys don't have a clue of what they are saying!! You will still be paying on Bitcoin fraction!!! I have L3+ ,and I get paid in Bitcoins...!! Same thing with D3, it mines dash, but you can also get paid on bitcoins!

Unfortunately buddy it is what it is man. But we still can profit on it. Thing is A5 Dashmater is too expensive costs 10k, but you see ROI in less than 2 months man!
