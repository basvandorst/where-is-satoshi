Thank you for the decent answer.

Trust me the wait is worth it. I was trying to convert about 5$ worth of dogecoin to bitcoin, then the email popped up from circle.
I am a very happy man :)

Looks like I signed up on may 17. You should contact them, maybe some things wrong. They are a great company.

Do you want that returned? (asking because it was tipped)

Its amazing how uneducated some people are about this topic. While laws that affect crypto as a whole come in, they just say "omg guyz let's sponsor moe stuffz".
Idiots. Thanks for taking the initiative @_date: 2014-07-18 12:56:21

Thanks a ton man, pm when sent.

I wish I knew this earlier lol, thanks

I converted some of my dogecoin into bitcoin, almost 8 dollars worth. It's amazing how 1,000 dogecoin can go from 2 dollars in February to it being worth 25cents in june. On top of that everyone is cheerful about it, saying "doge is on sale" I'm gonna be investing 50% doge and 50% bit, with doge being speculation and bit being something more dependable.

Why is it considered illegal?
Let's say coinbase, a company that's already big business, was based in Europe, and they allowed new yorkers without keeping records. What would the nydfs do about it?

@_date: 2014-07-18 12:49:37
What if I want to use the bitcoin in a business. Would it have to be under the counter, like how some contractors get payed, or it doesn't matter?
I mean to buy something with the bitcoin

@_date: 2014-07-18 12:48:26
Thank you for explaining.

Identifying the customers and adding a term of use will prevent action being taken to my company, correct? Instead, I would just be able to say that the new yorker is at fault?
Thanks, I'll check out the site.

I was gonna mine on a pool lol, I'm not dumb to mine solo. I'm asking which pool I should mine on.

How much is a bit? Isn't it 100 satoshis?

The scrypt miner at 50 kh makes 7 cents a day on dogecoin, the usb miner makes the same thing on bitcoin.

I don't want to be that guy but dogecoin does have people that care about it. Most of them do, actually, just not all of them are serious.
I usually keep away from all the memes and fun stuff there, I even made a rather profane post once which did not get down voted, but upvoted.
Most people do care :) Not trying to start a shitstorm

The lightweight clients slow down due to the large amount of payouts from mining. I have asics
@_date: 2014-07-18 13:17:30
You are taking a serious question and trolling it. With all due respect, fuck off.
@_date: 2014-08-07 19:49:47
I feel you, but I'd feel bad selling it all after being with it for so long. I just keep different investments and communities separate, the way it should be. I've contemplated leaving and joining bitcoin as well, but I can't relax in r/bitcoin.
Doge for rlx and bitcoin for srs
What shady things was moolah doing?

About a month ago I think. It could have been much longer for all I know.
@_date: 2014-06-02 23:31:07
oh but it is! both a 50kh/s scrypt miner and a 2gh/s bitcoin miner make 7cents a day according to coinwarz!
