compare the eth blockchain size with btc's ....

is it a mastercard or visa? where did you try to use it, offline or online?

i just checked a shitload of various solutions and they all seem to have had some kind of problems (i think its new eu regulations) and now i cant get a card from anyone.....tryed, xapo, bitpay, uquid....just found some article that in the beggining of january visa canceled all btc debit cards and most of them were using visa...this is really shitty....
theres the spectrecoin one which seams to work but i have found tons of red flags about that service....
there's this one on dsexchange....ill try it out and let you guys know if it went well....

wirex is unfortunately only for uk for now :(
as for epayments i checked it out but cant find the info that you can fund it with crypto anywhere (eaven though i found an article on steemit talking about it from 4months ago)....

man i have been giving people this argument for months now and not one single meaningfull answer.
Lets recap this in simple math.....
So BCH can do ~30tx/s (yeah its like 24-35 but lets make it a round number) with 8 MB blocks. If it REALLY gets adopted and people start to transact with it for buying normal stuff 30tx is absolutely nothing.
Visa can do more than 40k TX/s
SO for bch to become visa-like you would have to raise the blocksize a whole lot!
Lets do some basic level calculus:
8mb 30tx, 80mb 300tx, 800mb 3000tx, 8gb 30k TX.
Lets say 30k is visa-like.
That would mean that each 10minutes the blockchain grows 8gb, thats 48 GB/h, 1.152 TB/day, 34,56 TB/month, 414tb/year.
Guess who would be the only interested parties running full nodes?
Just take the hard disk costs, + since there wouldnt be that many nodes it would be very important for full nodes to have some kind of backup raid system if disks fail. Add to that to that the electricity, the personel, and just the sheer phisical space to store all these hard drives...
Who would be interested doing that pro bono? Exactly - banks, other financial institutions and governments, eventualy corporations....big players seeking to have controll in the system. 
We got crypto so that hopefully one day we can say "fuck off banks" and now we want to crawl back under their dominator boots, im not doing that!

hey guys how much would schnorr actually improve scaling in %....could someone eli5 me on this?
