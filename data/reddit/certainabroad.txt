exactly right! hence my suggestion to take a wait-and-see approach. there will be plenty of time to buy if this thing starts an upward trend again (which, imo, ain't looking too likely anytime soon)

Kraken is an absolutely terrible exchange. It was shut down for 3 days in early January at a time when Bitcoin was very volatile. They did not reach out to customers ahead of time to let them know. Ironically, it was down again today for over an hour.  Their customer service is almost nonexistent. Withdrawals are crazy to deal with!

Welcome to the wonderful world of Kraken. The worst!

ok smart guy, then load up the truck and buy all you can.
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:15:29
looking to buy around $5,600
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:40:38
panic selling will slow down at $5,600. Be patient.

Baloney! Bitcoin will never be used for small transactions like a cup of coffee or a UPS package. The timing of this article during today's bloodbath is fishy at best.
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:20:53
because you can't fight panic selling. so all the so called "hodlers" have totally caved in and sold.

unless the Tether dilemma turns out to be true and it's total fraud. then we go down to $1,000
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:30:31
Perhaps $2,000 worst case scenario.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:15:34
I think you are confused about the coins versus the underlying technology. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:47:44
i believe it. the market seems to be totally under control of a few big players. sad, really. 
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:06:56
they only banned illegal activities dufus.
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:24:00
he also said bitcoin was worthless!!!
@_date: 2018-02-02 04:25:07
It wasn't supposed to break 10,000 again. According to douche bag pumpers like Tom Lee the low was in for the year when it hit 9,200 a while back. How the hell are we pushing towards 8,000!?!

let's go back to beanie babies, at least they had some intrinsic value!
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:36:15
Uh, the first thing to do is be smart and close your Kraken account. Kraken is a total nightmare.
@_date: 2018-02-01 22:35:11
I would think twice about Kraken for high or low volume moments! I believe it was Tuesday morning and the system went down again for over an hour. They sent their engineers home for a nap during the 3 day period when the system was completely down for Christ's sake!
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:18:23
Of course the coins are worthless but the technology is going to be a game changer.

Some whale blew his wad. Who's gonna save it in during the next drop?
