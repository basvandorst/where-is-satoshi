I'm holding strong. the company I work for her in the US has had our site down due to some new plugin or a random billing issue. As of last week, they announced everything was on track to ship on time.

Hey Guys, 
I wrote the payment processes and was able to get the wallet address they sent the coin to. It's not much but its a start. If someone can track it like they did during the NicHash hack that would be dope. (I don't know how) 
"Thank you for your letter
Syan Mining account suspended from end of December last year (violated GoUrl Terms&amp;Conditions).
All payments were forwarded to Syan Mining external wallet address (13T7tzd6GVR7uVFjgvCCcx8kyVo3ziuTbk).
We don't keep user payments on our servers.
Need official request from police and we will provide Syan Mining log IP addresses.
Best Regards,

I have to say, I'm a fan of Syan so far. I have one of each of their SHA &amp; Scrypt units on the way. Their team is much more responsive than Bitmain has ever been. To their credit when they dropped the prices on their units they even offered to send me money back. Ordering was super easy too, since they have done only word of mouth promo their site lets you order your unit whenever. No dealing with site crashes on product release days like you have to deal with on Bitmains site. 
And hey at the end of the day the units are still profitable in my neck of the woods. The wild card will be the coin switching factor. If you watch the coinwarz charts there are some days when you can really capitalize on difficulty drops and market shifts. 
I plan to do a video review of each unit the day I get them. Stay tuned.
