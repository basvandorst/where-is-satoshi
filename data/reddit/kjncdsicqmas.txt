I don't believe that statement is quite correct.  Take a look at  the max fee necessary for ~90% chance to get into the next block was 0.00063 BTC/kb.  Which is about 11 cents USD at current valuation for an average transaction (257 bytes).
That said, I agree, electrum should bump up the accessible range... and likely bump up the default fee.

Yes there is an offline solution.
This is put out by the trezor folks:
trezorctl, a python program in there, has the following command line functions (giving you raw access to the functionality available from the device):
* ping 'Send ping message'
* get_address 'Get bitcoin address in base58 encoding'
* ethereum_get_address 'Get Ethereum address in hex encoding'
* ethereum_sign_tx 'Sign (and optionally publish) Ethereum transaction'
* get_entropy 'Get example entropy'
* get_features 'Retrieve device features and settings'
* get_public_node 'Get public node of given path'
* set_label 'Set new wallet label'
* set_homescreen 'Set new homescreen'
* clear_session 'Clear session (remove cached PIN, passphrase, etc.)'
* change_pin 'Change new PIN or remove existing'
* list_coins 'List all supported coin types by the device'
* wipe_device 'Reset device to factory defaults and remove all private data.'
* recovery_device 'Start safe recovery workflow'
* load_device 'Load custom configuration to the device'
* reset_device 'Perform device setup and generate new seed'
* sign_message 'Sign message using address of given path'
* verify_message 'Verify message'
* encrypt_message 'Encrypt message'
* decrypt_message 'Decrypt message'
* encrypt_keyvalue 'Encrypt value by given key and path'
* decrypt_keyvalue 'Decrypt value by given key and path'
* set_u2f_counter 'Set U2F counter'
* firmware_update 'Upload new firmware to device (must be in bootloader mode)'
Be sure you understand what you are doing if you choose to go this route.  Don't accidentally wipe any coins of which you haven't backed up your recovery words.
