Are you a caricature?

Wow dude you need to relax.
Stop trying to force the boogyman to be your political opposite.
You sound like an idological loon. And none of this "left vs right" bullshit has anything to do with Bitcoin.
I'm reporting this post now. Try reposting it without the BS politcal narrative.
Edit: I'm also going to point that you went out of your way to label "leftists...minorties or Jews" as the hypothetical enemies here, which is equally telling **AND** chilling.
For everyone not grasping the issue with OP or non-americans, the SEC is overseen and controlled by the powers of the President. 
So trump is a "leftist" now?
but Muh Narrative!

It's being downvoted because you're polarizing the source of this.
But it's not political, unless you believe RT (russias state run news outlet).
Since 9/11 right wing extremists groups have killed more Americans than Islamic extremists groups.
The numbers aren't even close.
While you're trying to use this to push a narrative, this is simply the same stupid policy that has always existed, limiting/blocking Fiat money's flow into extremist groups.

I knew I was going to get these types of comments.
I never said conservatives. If YOU want to equate right wing terrorists to everyday conservatives that’s on you. 
But don’t gaslight what I said, because you can’t argue with what I actually said.

It's not, see OPs other top level comment in the thread.
He's pushing a narrative, and distorting the facts.
You're either against this type of policy, or you're not.
But you don't get to pick and choose as OP is.

OP is blaming "leftists"
When the issue is simply goverment, and in this case the Trump Whitehouse (hint: not leftists).
But he's gotta get his BS spin in.

We’re talking about America here sport. The OP is about American policy, 9/11 is an American event... why are you confused by this?
@_date: 2019-05-05 01:57:07
So question, do you likewise oppose MasterCard blocking payments to Islamic extremists groups?
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:02:11
**SINCE** 9/11.
I'm trying really hard here to be charitable with you, but based on your framing of this, your title and subsequent comments, and your gaslighting of my comment - it feels a whole lot like you're simply trying to attack "leftists", and this has nothing to do with censorship - or bitcoin.
You're just here for a narrative.
@_date: 2019-05-05 04:22:59
It's not,this is simply expansion of the same stupid programs that Govts use to limit funding to terrorists groups.
Just so happens that right now america has a right wing terrorists problem.
Your issue is that it's "leftists" doing it by your account and you're using that to drive a political wedge on a Bitcoin sub.
This has no place here; not with your slant atleast.
Too bad too because it's a great example of the uses for Bitcoin. But you had to muck it up.
