I've heard that narrative before. Believe it or not, there are many of us who wanted to scale on chain, and when we realized that was never going to happen, we had to fork. BCH would not exist if BTC had increased the block size as it should have done 2 years ago. 
Any mining benefit is secondary. BCH would have no support if BTC scaled on chain.

Bitcoin isn't going to raise the blocksize. That's why Bitcoin Cash even exists.

It was slightly raised as a byproduct of an unnecessary hack, and not enough to stop fees from going out of control and making bitcoin unusable as a currency.

Its okay. I'll be banned soon enough so that only one narrative can be seen here.

Miners are essential. Your full node isn't.

Hi! Thanks!

Same here. Apparently someone has to manually approve the withdrawal, and they are backed up right now due to a surge in volume.

What block size do you think is appropriate?    
    
My understanding is that the 1MB block size was an arbitrary limit Satoshi hard-coded that was intended to be changed as needed.

Thanks for the detailed breakdown. It's hard to know what to believe without having the technical knowledge when there is so much dogma and propaganda floating around.    
    
On here Jihan and Roger are the boogeymen and on r/btc its Blockstream/Core. And over there many also say SegWit is a trojan horse. 


    
I like this persepctive. Appreciate the level-headed response!
