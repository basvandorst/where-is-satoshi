TREZOR is perfect!!!!! You get the wrong advice from the beginning, if you ask the computer freaks on a board like this. If you are only "half litereate" in these things, (like me), you should not take your advice from techies. You will make mistakes with encryption, backup, offline mode, virus detection, filehandling, computer crashes, reloading paperwallet. TREZOR is genius. TREZOR is as save as cold storage and at the same time as convinient as running your own wallet. No technical knowledge required. No nothing. Plug in Terzor, follow the three steps in the instrucion, take donw your 20 words on paper, hide them savely. Done. Experts here will disagree with me, because they lack the immagination of the countless pitfalls that are looming for the non-expert.

I can comfirm.
I tried to use it only once to pay for trezor by scanning the qr-code from their online shopping site. My blockchain iOS wallet proposed me to pay an amount 1000 times as high as the price of trezor. I guess it confued the European und the American meaning of the komma.

Agreed consumers need more incentives. Merchants do have incentives in the savings on fees and chargebacks. But they do not give back any portion of their savings to the consumer - yet. The reason being, that the merchant offering a bitcoin option is often the sole provider of that option. But over time, as more merchants enter bitcoin, competition will set in and force merchants to give bitcoin discounts. It will take some time, it will happen for commoditized products first, but it will happen. Conclusion: Merchant adoption will indirectly lead to consumer incentives.

Don´t reinvent the wheel. Use TREZOR. Trezor does exactly what you are planning to do: keeping private keys offline. It only does it much more efficiently and safely than you can ever do it. Your notebook might be invected at the time you buy it. How do you load the wallet software on the notebook? Also some time later you will have to load your paperwallet back online for spending. You also need only one trezor, for the same reason there is only one Fort Knox. I even leave my Trezor plugged in to my infected PC all day long with a couple of bitcoins on it. Nothing can happen, even if it is stolen or broken. The actual value is in the seed words which I keep safely in multiple locations.

That was the reason I got a TREZOR-hardware-wallet, and I am very happy with it. My bitcoins stay in this little box, and never leave it, exept if I pess the ok-key on the trezor to authorize a transaction. The only thing missing is the connection to mobile phones. Hope it will come sometime soon.

Trezor costs 119$ inc. shipping and is worth it. Since I started using it, I do not even think about security any more . Considering the convenience from bitcoins payments and asuming that savings from bitcoin trickle thru to the customer at some point, a Trezor should pay off even for the average user.

Trezor works perfectly for me, because I am not into all these computer security topics. But now I still worry about the bitcoins on my phone. 
Question: Would it be possible to connect the Trezor to the smartphone and make it my one-stopp solution for all my bitcoins?
EDIT: Maybe the phone could require a Trezor connection only for lager transactions above a limit of 100 $.

The annual remittance volume is roughly 500 billion dollars, which equates to around 1,4 billion dollars per day. Assuming that all remittances are done via bitcoin, and a roundtrip takes one day (buy dollars in the morning, send home, receive, exchange to local currency) around one third of all bitcoins (1,4 bn$ of 4,7 bn$) would be on the move and thus blocked on any given day. Consequently remittance, if done by bitcoin, would already justify one third of the current bitcoin price. This is only one application of bitcoin. Other financial streams a order of magnitude bigger than remittances. * Oil trade for examle would warrant 3 times the current bitcoin market cap.  And we have not even talked about the really big ones, like payroll, B2B settlement, stock exchange settlment.

Another reason for the downward price pressure is for sure the cashing in of early adopters. From what I heard, half the coins are owned by less than 100 people. I bet, that many of them have become used to a higher standard of living, than they can sustain with their income. Therefore they constantly have to permanently divest a portion of their holdings to buy luxury cars and villas. I consider this a necessary transition period during which the coin distribution gets broader.

Professionalizing bitcoin.
Kids running nodes in their home did a good service to bitcoin. But it is about time to scale bitcoin and the pioneers have to be replaced by professionals who can handle larger data volumes. Assuming we have enough different organisazions with commercial interest in bitcoin, a decentralized network with players such as Nasdaq Inc., , Circle, Fidor Bank, Goldman, Honduras Goverment, Overstock, KnCminer, Bitpay, Trezor.... can achieve the same effect. Pioneers in bitcoin might not like it, but  guys that make money out of bitcoin on every level of the value chain will have to take over, if it becomes too expensive for the volunteers.  As long as the array of these organizations  is divers enough it will work.

The whole subscription model for TV could change:  * 1 Sports events like a soccer games could be streamed directly by the team . 
 Right now sports is limited to distribution channels like sports canals. With direct streamin customers can be reached who are not willing to pay a monthly subscription for a sports channel, or customers that are not covered by the channels reach. 
* 2 The same logic applies to any content that reqires you to have a monthly subscription, like netflix, cable etc. There are always potential customers left out, who would be willing to pay for a particular netflix series or sports event. 
* 3 Even high quality porn sites could move away from pure subscribtion model.

For anything above 5 bitcoins TREZOR is the way to go. If it gets stolen the PIN-protection sets in with increasingly longer intervalls between flase pin entries. In the meantime  you can recover your funds with the seed and empty the stolen trezor. If it breaks, you still have the seed. For someting to be really save, it has to be easy.  Otherwise you make too many mistakes. I for my part do not want a second or third private key if I am not able to keep even one key save. I also prever plain English words for backup and one singe ok-button to authorize payment. Trezor is it.

Question to Nadsdaq:
After the stocks are finally on the blockchain, why not use a currency that is also on the blockchain for trading these shares? Payment and settlement would be in bitcoin on a marketplace similar to openbazar, with the Nasdaq as the notary. Nasdaq could completely take the bankingsector out of the equation and do a trade for a few cents instead of a few dollars.

All good points on the technical mechanics of the fork. But you left out one market mechanism completely: With the runnup to the fork approaching, I need to see a clear mayority  follow the larger blocksize version. Otherwise I will sell my bitcoins, and so will the majority of other rational holders. I am not into a 7 tps-bitcoin at all. Being stuck with this bonsai bitcoin for the forseeable future is out of question. Months ahead of the fork date the price of bitcoin will drop like a stone if we are below clear consensus. Ultimatly the miners will have to react or face extincion. Thus consensus is enforced.

Snapchat had 200 million users at the beginning of this year. That is at least 100 times the users of bitcoin, but only 5 times its valuation. In respect to number of users, bitcoin is 20 fold overvalued. This coincides with other metrics, for example the cost per transaction. Our mining fees per transaction is currently 10$, which is also at least 20 times too high. If you keep bitcoin as it is now we will go back to the 10-20 $ range. That is the price for college kids being able to run a node in a dormroom.

Think about what you said. When blocks are full with serious transactions, no fee in the world will get a additional transaction into the block. You might be able to kick out one of the other guys, by raising your fee tenfold. But that is true for everybody else. And the other people are not stupid either and will also raise their fees. In that case, hell breaks loose. A fee race beginns, and within a few blocks, fee will skyrocket and unconfirmed transactions pile up. Is that so hard to unterstand?

Bitcoin Investment Trust Gets Finra’s OK to Become Public Bitcoin Fund
Fund Intends to Trade on Electronic Platform Operated by OTC Markets Group

Barry Silbert’s Bitcoin Investment Trust is poised to become the first publicly traded bitcoin fund, with approval and assignment of a ticker symbol by the financial industry’s main self-regulatory body paving the way for trading on an electronic platform operated by OTC Markets Group .
The BIT, which was first launched in 2013 as a private fund for accredited investors with annual incomes greater than $200,000 or assets of more than $1 million, has been racing against a rival offering by twins Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, best known for their lawsuit against Facebook Inc. chief executive Mark Zuckerberg .
Whereas the competing Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust is going through a lengthy Securities and Exchange Commission process to register a formal exchange-traded fund, the BIT as taken a backdoor route to public listing. By exploiting a rule that allows holders of a private fund to sell their shares publicly after a 12-month lockup period and completing a less arduous approval process with the Financial Industry Regulatory Authority, some of those long-held shares in BIT should soon be available to investors of any income or wealth bracket. The BIT is sponsored by Grayscale Investments, a unit of Mr. Silbert’s Digital Currency Group, which he established last year to hold the digital currency interests of his broker-dealer SecondMarket Inc.

Guys, beleive me, bitcoin is too complex. I am double the age you guys here. I am non technical person and I had a hard time to get a hold of my bitcoins here in Germany. And then storing them on a infected computer was also no fun. I did not want to keep the coins with an exchange. I did not like blockchain with its emailed backups. I still do not know what 2FA is. The only thing I feel comfortabel with is a hardware solution like Trezor.

A country using bitcoin as their currency would have to weigh the initial costs (of aquiring bitcoin) against the advantages it reaps from bitcoin. I you are a small taxhaven in the caribian, you might want to take the risk. You could become a magnet for money on the run, and evade all the bullying that normally comes with it from the US.
