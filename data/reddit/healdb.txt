It's more like DOGE != BTC :P
@_date: 2014-10-01 01:27:46
I don't know what to tell you? 
@_date: 2014-07-28 17:03:17
Well considering they do have a very solid dev/support team, I think they really will be able to help to improve the exchange.

He probably made up the entire thing in the hopes of getting free money. The line-
 " I told him to tell the owner, "The Bitcoin community will take care of me!" 
Kinda gives it away
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:52:48
Why would you Propose that something is wrong with his key?
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:57:22
"Hey I missed the bus to Jersey so I need a Bitcoin to take the express train down so I can see my sick mother. " 
Am I doing it right?
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:47:27
It doesn't sound like you were fired for asking to be paid in bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:36:30
Out of the loop here- what's been going on with Bitstamp?
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:53:27
Hes just trying to bait us into giving him free money haha
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:38:11
Please, don't tip such small amounts outside it is seen as spam.
Also please don't use "verify" unless it is a huge tip. Otherwise it is just spam and only serves to slow down the tip bot.
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:44:56
Can I just send you my public key?
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:51:22
Obviously. Why would "a close personal friend" fire him just for asking to be paid in a digital currency? He probably either made this whole thing up or did something else wrong.

From the sidebar- 
What services do you offer?
@_date: 2014-04-10 17:43:14
Hey thanks! 
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:36:09
Bitcoin tips are absolutely welcome in why shouldn't dogecoin tips be allowed here?  
Edit- I agree that we shouldn't be tipping small amounts as that gets spammy, but larger tips should absolutely be allowed.

How much is one u bit in usd?
@_date: 2014-09-30 17:27:18
Well I tried with my Pi a few months back as well, only got 35 kh/s
@_date: 2014-05-12 02:50:44
Indeed, I've seen plenty of newbies try to convince me that "verify" is a necessary part of the syntax haha
@_date: 2014-04-09 21:55:10
Change tip is pretty simple
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:27:03
Why should that matter?
@_date: 2014-06-05 03:31:44
So what is it?
@_date: 2014-09-30 15:28:39
The hashrate of an non-overclocked raspberry pi only gets around 35 kh/s, so you would always mine at a loss. It would literally take years to make any amount of Bitcoins.
Source- I've tried this before.
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:58:07
Maybe both?
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:41:19
Shredding money isn't an act of defiance, it's just silly.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:01:34
I would be very interested in this. I have quite a lot of experience with making reddit bots so I could help to handle and host all bots that this subreddit uses. Check my website- 
@_date: 2014-05-23 20:05:21
Well then I'm glad you aren't in a position to make that decision.
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:31:23
This is a great step forward. Thank you for keeping an open mind about digital currencies.
@_date: 2014-06-05 00:57:36
Not really. This user has simply pulled the last 40 pages of each tipbot, which all go back to completely different time periods. For example, on the dogetipbot, it goes back 12 hours, while on the bitcoin tipper, it goes back several days. 
So while it does give us an idea on the average tip size, it doesn't give an accurate picture about who tips more.
@_date: 2014-05-23 19:26:12
So that means you should just dismiss all people who use dogecoin because of your personal unfair prejudices?
