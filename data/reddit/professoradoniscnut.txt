100% the cash, but I wouldn't keep it all that way.
It I had it in BTC, I have to pay CGT to turn any of it into fiat. It's effectively worth less because of it.
If I have it in cash, I can buy the $1mil worth of BTC and have a $1mil cost base for it. That's a million dollars of income I don't pay taxes on down the line. Worst case scenario Bitcoin drops to nothing and at least I have a $1mil capital loss to carry forward.

That's a really weird thing to say... not only are they unrelated, spreadsheets were actually a pretty important technology. It'd be like saying that electric cars are no better a technology than ballpoint pens.
If he's saying that Bitcoin will do for spending money what spreadsheets did for a sheet of paper and a calculator, that sound advocacy.

It's a much worse conductor than copper actually, it's used for contacts because it won't corrode.
Still definitely true though that the Mansa Musa of asteroids would see industrial usage of gold ramp up.
@_date: 2019-07-08 02:11:13
It doesn't though, not in real terms. If the total number of bitcoins functionally drops from 21mil to 15mil due to all lost private keys, buying them works out the same just with a different number.
You want to buy one twenty-one millionth of the total bitcoins in existence, which at current market rates cost $10k USD or whatever? No difference for you at all, except that if there were no lost keys that comes to 1.0btc and if there were 6mil btc lost it's 0.714btc.

There really should be a way to allow an additional amount to be added to the fee for a transaction.
Doesn't seem like it would be overly difficult to include in the protocol and would be a much better solution than trying to convince the mining community to behave as a malicious party running a permanent doublespend service.

People didn't give their money to Bitcoin, they gave it to other people for Bitcoin. There is no pool of value (in assets, other currencies or otherwise) that belongs to some nebulous Bitcoin entity, just people trading one currency for another.
The price is set by what people are willing to buy and sell for. No single person makes the decision, since buyers and sellers will find each other and the value is where buyers and sellers meet. Their decisions on what price to accept are based on whatever they want, but usually things like how secure it is to hold, how easily it can be transferred, how different governments and organisations, and how they expect is value to change in the future.
If people stop thinking it's as secure or that it will probably be worth less down the line they, won't trade as many dollars for it. If that happens, then people who have some and want to sell have to sell to buyers that won't pay as much.

"market cap"

And while we're at it, why bother with all this p2p cryptography? Why don't we just get some kind of benevolent central bank to manage the network, then they could regulate the supply of bitcoins going in, keep track of suspicious transactions, allow transactions to be reversed in cases of fraud and guarantee the identities of parties you trade with.

For the blockchain, that linear nature is both a necessity and the whole reason it works. There is no assumed way of identifying 'attackers' from 'defenders', there is only 'me' and a network made of 'others who might be attackers'.
The blockchain works without any player having special knowledge and without assuming anything but rational self-interest on the part of everyone else.
There is no secret hash encrypting the network for only the good guys to know (there are for accounts, but that's different). A bank can use that and secure things against attack, the cost for you is that they're in control.
If you could even describe something similar to bitcoin but which is protected against attack by an n-bit key security, I'd be interested to hear how it'd work.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:48:11
If only there were some way of encoding data so that it is secure against random noise.
Perhaps one which builds on the work of Richard Hamming and had been developed over more than half a century as a ubiquitous and integral component of many parts of information processing and storage technology.

Market cap is definitely the wrong term, but narrow money stock (or monetary base or whatever other name) isn't really right either. The narrow money stock of bitcoin is ~12,000,000BTC, not any USD amount.

The point of mining is not to 'spread the wealth', at least not anymore. At the start it did that, but that was just to get the ball rolling. The endgame of mining, which we will gently transition to over the next few years, is not to make money for hobbyists, it is to manage the network in a way that is secure against attack.
Non-mining users effectively pay you to mine, either because they own less of the network for each block injected or because they pay transaction fees. They do this because you contribute to managing and encrypting the network, which makes the currency they hold and transactions with it trustworthy.
The sooner the legit miners switch to the next cutting edge tech, the better. Now that they're getting to ASICs, there are no longer any giant leaps possible. Noone can come out of nowhere and threaten the network with a better miner, they have to beat the entire thing on scale. How this is distributed doesn't matter, so long as no one player has as much as everyone else put together.
In the long run, wealth gets spread out by people trading with BTC, not by being mined. You don't get a weekly allowance of BTC for being part of the community.
