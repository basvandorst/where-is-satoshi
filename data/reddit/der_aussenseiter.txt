This kind of thinking is holding back progress for drugs that have a bad reputation. There are plenty of things that are illegal that help people, just because you had one bad experience doesn't mean it won't help other people. 
There are legal medications that can kill people from withdrawals and have bad side effects on some people, that doesn't stop doctors from prescribing them even if you're the 1/10 people who could have a bad reaction to it. Why? Because every single drug affects people differently, and people take that small risk because it has a potential to help them. MDMA is no different or else these large companies wouldn't be bothered researching/investing in it if it was useless.

Yup pretty much the same thing except I think the only real difference is he will notice if his comment gets removed. If he got shadow banned he would think his comment is there, but others won't.

So, they pretty much added innocent people and even known journalists to their lists. Real nice classing anyone who just wants privacy to be somewhat of a threat. 
Also, i noticed how banks treat bitcoin, they automatically associate it with something bad and ask alot of questions.   
Now, does that make sense to you? Why, if bitcoin is completely legal, that they dont want you touching it? Why do they not want you to be "private"?
I'm sure many people search this stuff daily, and like how they have your other information, they'll only use it if they absolutely need to. So I'm sure the list is mainly just to help them point down possible people for whatever they may be looking for.
But they know people who use such services are mostly somewhat knowledgeable with computers, and now have obtained information to be more untraceable. They think anyone who uses such services has something to hide, which isn't always the case.
