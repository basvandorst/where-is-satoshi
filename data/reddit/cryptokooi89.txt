What about Bitcoin being a way to transfer money quickly from one country to another, both countries using a different fiat? 
I think on some day fiat money won't be crossing any borders anymore.

What you could do is actually spread your coins around various respected exchanges such as Binance, Bitstamp, Kraken, Poliniex, Huobi etc. 
I don't think the chances are really great that those exchanges get hacked at the same time.

Oh damn, I should have studied IT....
I know how to find my Raspberry's IP. But what do you mean with: " After you've SSH'd in, you'll see a menu - the first option ("INFO") shows the same screen as the external screen would show if you had one."?
Will I be able to see 'the screen of my RPI' on my PC, after I SSH'd in?

How do you do it without the external screen then? The guide doesn't tell that?
@_date: 2019-03-16 09:02:24
Those guys who cashed out in the peak are already but back in or have done that. It simply takes some time to accumulate Bitcoin so it will become artificially sacre again. When it's time, the biggest bagholders will start posting and shilling about Bitcoin. The mass will pump up the price with the remaining few Bitcoin actively in circulation. We will see new highs, smart boys will sell off causing a bear market. Then, rinse and repeat. It's so easy really.

People buy Bitcoin futures because they think Bitcoin will have increased in price at the setle date..?
Edit: Lol I see what you are saying now. They could just buy Bitcoin obviously and wait till the day they would have settled their future..
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:18:49
That's a gap.
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:20:18
Thanks for the brief explanation. This clears up alot. I've had a few months of lessons during my study about this but it kind of sank away.
So if you buy a contract, you buy a right to buy the underlaying asset in the future. The counterparty that sold you that right is mandatory to follow up their promise they made in exchange for some cash.

Thank you. Pretty much what I was inspecting. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:18:11
Thanks for the nice reply. I understand the big picture, but I am still trying to get the exact pieces in their place. I don't know what scenarios can play out.
What is the price of corn goes up and the farmen bet that Bitcoin will lower in price (e.g.: Price now is $7500 and farmer bets it will be $5000 by next year), then what? He got his profits out of his corn. But he still has got the contract. 
- What are the consequences of that contract? 
- Is it an option for the farmer to excecute the contract (so he can cancel it if he wants to) or is he obliged to execute the contract? 
- What are the actual outcomes if he has to execute the contract? 
He bet Bitcoin will go down to $5000 in a years time. Another person made a contract with him (I assume to counterparty thinks Bitcoin will rise?). Who pays what fee?
Sorry, so many questions come to mind ;)
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:59:55
It says 400%. But 400% compared to what? 
BCH have something like 'emergency difficulty adjustment' right? How does that work exactly?
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:13:13
I don't see how this is good for the price of Bitcoin. They (Bitcoin haters) are actually able to short Bitcoin and manipulate the price through a second market?
Or is the futures market more like a gamble on Bitcoin price?
@_date: 2019-10-26 22:35:46
He never says why Bitcoin would rise. Never a reason.

Hello Could you please explain this a little bit more?
I am just curious how traders of the Bitcoin futures can effect the Bitcoin market. I mean, is there a possibility for the futures traders to manipulate the Bitcoin price, wether is is up or down?
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:28:56
You are right! I remember now. Gonna grab those old study books tomorrow. So futures are actually really betting on Bitcoin price while options are some kind of 'save' bets. Or better, options are hedge where futures can be a hedge if you are lucky :P
@_date: 2019-12-12 22:59:37
I am going to read this probably 10 times before I really understand itt, the part about Globalized Investment.
@_date: 2019-12-18 18:53:29
When the prior halving events happened, there was no real way to short Bitcoin to the ground. Now that we've got cash settled futures this is possible. That's why I think the theory of a new bull market after the halving of May isn't going to play out. 
Melamed said:  “We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We’ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules.” 
I am afraid he will be right.
@_date: 2017-11-16 15:48:23
Yeah. But as for as I know you can hedge yourself using a short against a long position too, right?

Hey! I am a little bit further now and I think things or going good! :)I am at a point in the guide again thought which I am not so sure about what to do. It is under 'Hardening your Pi'.
I'm not so sure about the 5th line I have to enter, the part about the IP. The address of my Pi is 'xxx . xxx . x . xx'. Now, what should the next two lines look like for me? I am not so sure about the '0/24' part.
$ ufw allow from [192.168.0.0/24]( to any port 22 comment 'allow SSH from local LAN'
$ ufw allow proto udp from [192.168.0.0/24]( port 1900 to any comment 'allow local LAN SSDP for UPnP discovery'
I mean, the IP of the RPi in the guide is [192.168.0.20]( Why would the writer of the guide use [192.168.0.0/24]( in those commands? Or should I use [192.168.0.0/24]( too altough it is not my RPi IP?
Also, after the 192.168 part my RPi's IP does not contain '.0' but '.2'. So should I use [192.168.2.0/24]( then?
maybe you can help me with this too? :)

I've always said and it is my vision, that if I ever get rich I will help out the less rich people. Unfortunately, I am not that richt ;)
I am really wondering though how you can make people so much money. Could you give a little bit more information on that? I mean, you've set some serious goals for yourself.
Or, where can I sign up to your course? ;)

How you heared about Bitquence and what they are planning to do? They want to make buying Bitcoin and any other cryptocoin as easy as you described. Their goal is to make the interface easy to use, similar what Apple did to mobile phones with iOS. Besides that, Bitquence will store their customer's crypto offline IE cold wallet. I would strongly advise you to take a look at it.

You know Bitcon is still in Beta? It's version 0.1.something. Beta products are not perfect.
There are a ton of developers all around the world helping to improve Bitcoin. And because of that, it's one of the few coins that are truely decentralized.
And as last, 1 Bitcoin will always be 1 Bitcoin. So what is actually volatile? Bitcoin or fiat money? The thing is, with blockchain you can actually tokenize actual real world assets. So let's say, you bought a real estate coin that represents 1% of a building. That actually hold value, bricks. You can also pay with it. Humans used to do that, before fiat was introduced. You know, trade a sheep against some corn for example. Blockchain enables true 
@_date: 2017-09-22 15:57:53
Pretty epic stuff. Crypto makes existing assets both digital and boosts it's liquidity. Exactly as paper money (which was backed by actual gold) made gold liquid. 
So basicly crypto can make alot of existing liquid, for example real estate. As I see it, something like OmiseGo wants to make all existing coins and fiat currency tradeble. 
Does it look like we are going back to barter? We can basicly just trade goods with each other by trading the coins which made those goods liquid. And banks are not needed for barter. Am I on the right track?
The worse thing is that banks have power to change the laws one way or the other, since money = power. Music, movie and shopping industries didn't have the power to stop the disrupters though. I think that's a key difference between disrupting mucic, movies and shopping vs actual money.
@_date: 2019-09-15 12:34:44
I am wondering though... Bitcoin was not even 1 year online. But how many miners were there back then? I think everyone was still mining with their CPU in their PC? How did miners convince each other to update their mining software?
I mean, it was over $11B that the 2 miners received in that tx. They could have just dumped those Bitcoin on Mt.Gox (however.., I am not sure if the liquidity was enough to even cash out a million quicky..?).
@_date: 2019-09-15 12:04:02
I've got a question about 7 day active supply though. What if someone keeps their Bitcoin in a Binance wallet for example but still buy/sell their Bitcoin. I mean, the Bitcoin just sits in a Binance wallet right but it still keep trading which means the price can fluctuate bases on Bitcoin that are sitting in a wallet.

What you could do it tell your friend their stake of the total money supply decreases. I told my friend it this way: What I tell you that the total wealth is $100.000 in the world and you owe $10.000 which is 10%. Would you like it if someone changes the total wealth to $200.000 which means you only still own 5%, just like that?'. That got at least a few of my friends thinking, especially when I told them this isn't possible with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-12 14:59:08
I try explaining this to my friends as well. But people have no clue what is going on and what the banks are doing. They are just like: 'Oh whatever'. That's probably because they simply don't have the capability to understand it.

Hi I just finished the 'Bitoin'' chapter of the guide ( [ thanks to your help! As for as I know I did everything right, but...
Under the header 'Verification of bitcoind operation' it says: "After rebooting, the bitcoind should start and begin to sync and validate the Bitcoin blockchain.'. So I just shut down my RPi by using '$ sudo shutdown -r now'. Then basically nothing happens. I simply restart Putty and reconnect via SSH and login as admin. At that point, should I be seeing something processing? Because I only just see my SSH command screen waiting for me to do something.
I just want to know how I can check wether I did everything as I should have.
Also, can I just resume the guide and continue with the chapter 'Lightning' even though I have not downloaded the whole blockchain yet?
Thanks in advance!

I have a question about updating my node aswell. I am in the progress of setting up my Bitcoin Core node on my Raspberry Pi. Currently I am downloading the blockchain on my Windows desktop. How do I update my node on my Pi from 0.17.0 to 0.18.0?
@_date: 2018-12-24 14:50:04
Is that so? Do you have a source?
As far as I know Bitcoin is a name (of a currency) and names are being written with a capital letter.
@_date: 2019-05-09 15:51:33
Well, this might take a while haha.
I installed 0.18.0 and now Bitcoin Core is syncing with 0.04% per hour. I am at 72% but this will take 3 more weeks to sync. Weird, since it went a lot quicker on 0.17.0.
I'll get back to you in 3 weeks I guess :p

@_date: 2019-05-04 11:18:49
Unfortunetaly I don't see the exact messages your telling me I should see after '$ sudo tail -f /home/bitcoin/.bitcoin/testnet3/debug.log'. My guess is it's because Bitcoin 0.18.0 has just been released and I just installed 0.17.0 on my RPi. So I guess I'll have to get back in the guide a bit and update to 0.18.0. I just hope I didn't make any mess ups, haha. It might have something to do I am describing in my next alinea.
And yes, you're right about downloading the blockchain. The first 40% went very quicly. As the guide told me to do, I am currently downloading the Bitcoin blockchain on my desktop on to a HDD. It goes pretty slow indeed. I am at 60% right now but I have had my PC download now for quite a time already. My internet speed is 7MB/s. So 200GB would just take about 8 hours I would say.. Anyway, after that I will migrate the data from my desktop HDD towards my RPi HDD. So two things:
\- I think this is why the command to check on the blockchain doesn't give me the 'right' outputs
\- I guess my RPi won't overheat this way
Now that I think about it: Why is the guide telling me to download the blockchain with my desktop first and then migrate it to the HDD of my Pi. I mean, my Pi is connected to the internet with a LAN cable, so the download should be just as fast as I am downloading with my dekstop.
Going to wait until my download is complete and then I will migrate the blockchain to my Pi.
@_date: 2019-05-07 19:59:15
Cool! I am currently at 70% downloading the blockchain. 
I tried updating to 0.18.0 but not sure if it worked. If I had known that I didn't have to update it necessarily I would not have done it, haha.
Going to continue the guide once I've got the blockchain on my HDD. If I have any questions, I'll get back to you ;)
Thanks again!
