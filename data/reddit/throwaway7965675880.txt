I also tried going to the "import bitcoin addresses or private keys" option in the second window in Electrum just to try a different route.  Doing this with the uncompressed private key created a new wallet, but it has no funds in it... and the old wallet is still in Multibit with the bitcoin balance still on it.  Not sure how its possible to have two wallets with the same private key but one with the funds and one without?!?

The coins are in a Multibit wallet, but the exchange box says Mt Gox.  Also, where there was a USD balance displayed is blank.  But the BTC balance is still there.

Thank you.  It's not a huge amount of money relative to many here but I'm still very pleased.  It's worth a lot more than it was when I bought it and that's awesome it's still accessible.  I'm not well versed in this and when I saw "MtGox" in a field in my wallet I was worried.

This is where my ignorance shows...  all I know is that when I purchased the bitcoins I put them in this wallet on multibit with the exchange as Mt Gox.  The bitcoin balance is still there but the USD balance is blank... not sure if that's related.

Do you mean simply create a new wallet in Electrum and transfer the balance to the new wallet?    I don't think I've tried that exactly, but I did try to create a new wallet in Electrum by uncompressing my private key and transferring.  When I get to the window where you enter the uncompressed private key in a dialogue box the "next" button stays unclickable and I'm stuck.

Thank you, this is the info I was looking for.  I simply created a new wallet in Electrum and was able to transfer the funds.

You're correct.  I'm just dumb haha.

I followed the instructions to move my wallet from Multibit to Electrum but when it gets to the part where I enter the private key in Electrum, the next button stays unhighlighted and I cannot go to the next step.  Any suggestions?

Thanks for responding but I'm using the old version of Multibit, not Multibit HD.  Will it work with the old version of Multibit?
nvmnd I see the next vid for classic version, thanks

Thanks for replying.  I tried making another wallet in multibit and uncompressed the private key for that one also.  I tried creating new seeds from both my old wallet, then the new one, and then tried both with the same results. Entering the private keys in Electrum does not highlight the next button.  Still stuck.

Would you please explain why exporting my wallet to Electrum is necessary as an intermediary between Multibit and Coinbase?
