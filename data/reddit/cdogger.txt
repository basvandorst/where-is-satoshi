Who is going to pay $150 transfer fees? That would preclude everyday use wouldn't it?
What does my profile have to do with the question?
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:45:02
They aren't going to block any transactions and they don't need to. That's not how sanctions work. The threat of secondary sanctions forces institutions to not do business with sanctioned groups. I'm actually interested in this topic but all you've done is squeal about teh unstoppable bitcoin and saying sanctions don't matter - which is obviously incorrect.

I think this means BC will either stay flat or go up! Or go down.

From 2 months ago, but may be of interest

If $20 is substantial to you, you shouldn't be spending it on bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 02:29:59
Cheap electricity where you're at? 
@_date: 2018-11-29 19:07:56
Well I don't think US government can stop these guys from using crypto - but they *can* sanction hammer anybody who transacts with them. But I thought there were wallets that could be 100% anonymous, so I'm not sure how effective this will be. Maybe that's why SEC is pushing for custody "solutions"?

Isn't Bitpay just a payment processor? 


Here's another one. I guess I should know better than to trust the media, but they certainly are presenting Bitpay as a payment processor.


@_date: 2018-11-29 18:13:42
Yes because when it gains 10x value (unlikely) that $200 is totally gonna change your life. 
Or you just put your grocery money into a volatile asset. Smart.

Wouldn't high fees hamper adoption?

Great idea! You can share some of yours with me!

So what did you tell her? 
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:16:33
Do you actually think you can successfully avoid paying taxes or are you just throwing a temper tantrum?
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:32:24
Thats an entirely different conversation. I agree most governments are bloated and wasteful. 
The reality is that they set the tax rates on goods and services which includes crypto. And they *will* collect. If you think you can evade, good luck. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 22:19:15
You'll use so much electricity that they will notice and probably evict you. Maybe if you only had 1 ASIC you could gwt away with it. I doubt you're the first one to think of this scam. And it is scamming the landlord. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 19:40:20
Crypto will be taxed however governments want to tax it. If you think that can be escaped, you're dumber than you sound. No pay taxes, no lambo. Good luck.
@_date: 2018-11-29 20:40:17
Don't worry, that's how that guy responds to everybody - he's a bit of a loon. 
He is right though, you would need a lot more processing power than available from an iphone.
 
@_date: 2018-11-30 21:50:45
Ya but when it was 20k errybody was kicking themselves for not buying at 4k. I don't think anybody who buys in at below 4k will regret it long term. 
@_date: 2018-11-30 23:57:35
You only got fucked by bitcoin if you bought high and sold low. Which is to say you fucked yourself. 
Still made me lol
@_date: 2018-11-30 20:40:10
Thats just semantics and irrelevant since 99% of the population still uses local currency for 99% of their purchases. if everybody used crypto for everything they would start taxing crypto. It makes no difference if they force you to convert to fiat and tax that - its effectively a tax on your crypto. You can piss and moan all you like, its reality.
@_date: 2018-11-28 17:43:53
Are "digital currency addresses" supposed to be anonymous? Apparently they are not. 




I guess it's very much the same as Trump admins Iran sanctions: they can't unilaterally block Iran from global financial institutions and they can't force Europe not to do business with Iran, but they can apply secondary sanctions on EU businesses that do so. Likewise here, they may not have any ability to block or shut down these digital currency addresses, but they can sanction-hammer anybody who transacts with them.

Need cheap electricity for mining to be feasible 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:40:55
Birks in Canada - 
Ohio just announced that businesses can pay their taxes in bitcoin - 
And NASDAQ is going to offer bitcoin futures - 
@_date: 2018-11-28 18:05:16
Apparently yes.

That's all he ever does
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:30:23
The value changing significantly over 50 years doesn't matter. Whatever currency or store of value you're using will change in value over time. Bitcoin, gold, USD doesn't matter. 
I'm not saying the USD **should** be the only thing against which all value is measured, I'm telling you that for all practical purposes it **is.** Will that change in the future? Probably. And whatever the new thing is will not be static. 
@_date: 2018-12-06 16:43:57
No. How would volatile crytocurrency "solve" stock market volatility?
Crypto won't let firms evade tariffs either.
@_date: 2018-12-07 21:03:28
USD is the global reserve currency - all other currencies are pegged to it. 
For other currencies like the canadian dollar, minor fluctuations don't really matter. If the Canadian dollar drops enough (like when it hits 60% value vs USD) it can and does affect prices as imported products will cost more. It sucks for canadians but its not the end of the world because when their dollar is weak the labor cost manufacturing drops - more jobs more economic activity. As long as you dont have wild fluctuations or hyperinflation it's irrelevant to the vast majority of people.

You should give it a strong German name. Like Hindenburg
@_date: 2018-12-12 21:49:28
Where are you getting this from?
Personal income tax rates are lower than 40%
Corporate tax rates are lower than 40%
Capital gains tax is lower than 40%
In what world is anybody paying 40% tax on crypto? 
Are you retarded or just a shill?

[when you try to pay with shitcoin](
@_date: 2018-12-07 07:58:05
These major currencies are not all going to simultaneously collapse. A world in which they did would be one where electricity (energy) is too valuable to use on inefficient transactions.

He shouldn't have listened to Gandalf 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:46:01
Yes you did lose 50k. 
If your house goes up in value 50k, you can refinance or get a loan secured against the house. Because it's an asset. That has value. 
If your house goes down in value you will not be able to do so. 
If you're happy where you live and no reason to move or have any interest in securing additional loans against your house then the value of your house would make no difference to you. But if it's value drops, you have in fact lost that value. 
@_date: 2018-12-01 04:08:44
Are you retarded? $100-$200 a month in electricity? You're right nobody will notice. Noise either. Lol! I'm giving the kid sensible advice: don't fuck up your college living situation in a failing attempt to mine bitcoin. 
Also theres no such thing as free electricty
@_date: 2018-12-08 01:11:26
Cool! Does she actually take bitcoin directly or does she use something like bitpay to convert it to local currency at point of sale?

I can't wait until i have a whole bitcoin. But I won't leave it in a wallet, I want to display it on my wall. How much does a bitcoin weigh? Can i just mountit on the drywall or will i need a bracket?

Sell your house to buy crypto!

@_date: 2018-12-06 04:43:15
Who cares? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:42:30
Nobody else cares about your sentimental value. When people talk about value, as in a house, they are talking about monetary value. 
Again, when the monetary value of an asset drops, you have lost that value. If you don't plan on selling or securing loans against the asset, the monetary value will make no difference to you but it still exists.
@_date: 2018-12-08 03:40:24
Wow, that's even better! Some people hate bitpay for what it is - I'm happy with baby steps. But I love to hear when merchants *actually take* bitcoin!
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:33:54
Lol, no. Pretty sure they're upset at new fuel taxes and the lack of economic opportunity. Don't worry though, when nobody in France can afford to drive France will be 5% closer to meeting their climate commitments. Not quite Somalia league, but they're working on it.
@_date: 2018-12-03 17:22:25
So its like ebay or craigslist except the medium of exchange is crypto?
@_date: 2018-12-08 00:33:29
Just think of it as a chance to get cheap bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-12-07 18:36:51
Only if you think it's going to crash and never recover or you need the $150 right now. 
If you bought at 16k and didn't sell when it was at 6-7k for 6 months it makes no sense to sell now that its going to dip sub 3k. 
@_date: 2018-12-14 00:59:14
Hah, like Tim Drapers tie!
