I have about $15,000 in BTC and $5,000 in my ROTH. I'm 20 years old. It's my first year working on my ROTH and investing in general. I understand it's important to have a reasonable portfolio for my retirement. But with my age and the potential of Bitcoin and crypto, I find myself wanting to throw the rest into Bitcoin.

This subreddit is really preaching to the choir though. I can confidently say that I feel most Reddit users know of Bitcoin and many may own some. I feel that people looking for more info are more likely to end up on news websites like CNN and Forbes. This subreddit is a good place to be idiotic and have a good time

First off you don't know he is a kid. Assuming he has his own personal bank I'm going to assume he's a man. Also you don't know he's lying. You're using supposed anecdotal "evidence". This subreddit is for talk about Bitcoin and it's situations. At the most a place for constructive criticism. You are giving neither of these. He shared a story about his bank that was Bitcoin related. Very childish to go ahead and bash him and call him demeaning names. We don't need that attitude here.
But seriously have a good day and try to keep your head up. Take it easy

I could've  easily posted this on another account if you think that's the reason I did this. I did this to hopefully spread the message of him. I'm sorry if it comes of as karma whorish but that's not the intention

 Don't want that to happen for awhile. Need to keep stocking up and keeping my mining rigs going before difficulties and prices get too high!
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:18:57
Will this fork happen after october20th?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:04:09
Your argument is just as weak as the argument for this story being true. Continue to call other people names and be a troll. Wish you would keep It out of this sub.

Good! I'll be using it then :) so how do you benefit from the site? Is there selling fees? How do you plan to keep it running and self sustaining
