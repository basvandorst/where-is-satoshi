i do this everyday. i think it is one of the most powerful things we can do to speed up the revolution. "do you take bitcoin here?"... huge.

i have used it several times, really great. basically you check out (in amazon or one of the other participating shops) like normal and a button appears that allows zinc save to take over on the payment. you go to zinc's site and pay them bitcoins. then you get your stuff.
zinc/amazon does not work right now for some reason.

if you have an android phone, download Mycelium. then go on craigslist and find a seller in your area, meet in a coffee shop, buy the coins (have them sent to your mycelium wallet) then transfer them to a more secure wallet (bitcoin qt or cold storage) when you get home. Do a google search for 'bitcoin cold storage' to get a good idea of how to do this.

that's what dad said...

Exactly, though I might change it to "under 30". Going all in at 23 has a large potential upside, and plenty of time to correct if it goes the wrong way.
