Yes KEUR and MEUR are the same in all languages which makes it easier.

Ignoring the part about the internet being an american thing bitcoin prices are usually qouted in dollars in America. I don't think of bitcoin prices in dollars but kroners. The place where I buy and sell is kroners only. If posint here I use dollars because more people are familiar with it.

Kilo Euros, Mega Euros and Giga Euros are used all the time in financial reports. mili Euros are not used simply because nothing costs 0.001 euros.

Everyone outside the US does since every country outside the US has converted or is converting to metric. However Americans often think they are the world. In my bitcoin community milibitcoin is an established term. mBit is a nice shorter way of writing it that everyone should understand.

Rare because no English speaking country has euros. Also most people don't talk about millions of euros. It is mainly used for accounting/financial reports.

We don't write megaeuros in a financial statement but we often use MEUR 
And KEUR:

How is this more awkard than using centi dollar (cents). It is quit intuitive that milibitcoin is 0.001. mBTC is easy to understand and hard to misinterpret.

That is assuming that the NSA isn't involved with writing all that bloatware. You are better off buying a phone abroad. Order a phone from a foreign producer from a foreign website and have it shipped to you. Preferably an obscure model.

1) It is fully possible but I still would prefer it to a version that the carrier had messed with. There are different kinds of backdoors and there might be more backdoors or backdoors that unlock specific functions if you have modified version of android.
2) Encrypt your communications. They will allways get your metadata regardless of what you do but with proper encryption they can't get the message. 
3) I hardly think they open every package that is sent and install new hardware on every device. If you are involved in anything you should however.
4) true, you are never safe, just safer.
5) That isn't your phone's fault.

It has nothing to do with bitcoin. It does however mean that the encyption software that you get from big companies is desgined not to be secure and that you should go for opensource alternatives.
