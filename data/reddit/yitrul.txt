I could even see them being in a good position to adopt BTC into their business model.  They could buy/sell BTC as a manner of transferring money.

Generate your paper wallets offline, privately... split them into at least three parts and keep only one of them.  Do not store all your coin in one wallet.  It becomes more effort than it is worth to try and extort you for it.

Sounds like a bank that's much more interested in their customer relationships.

Okay... but do they refuse to do business with you, because you're involved with bitcoin?  The counter argument to their argument are numerous and simple.

When the price of bitcoin goes up, that's good - more bang for your buck.  When the price of bitcoin goes down, that's good - easier to exchange.

Ah.  Good.  You have leverage.  Has she made any comments about the bank's position on bitcoin or a willingness to learn?

Well, no... you would generally put the dog down - not the owner.  There's a massive difference in responsibility there.

Nah, you could definitely make an NFC system useful.  Merchant NFC sends an itemized list of items being purchased, total and address... phone requests an unlock code on screen vs amount.  You authorize, and the transaction is complete.

You do.  Encrypted paper wallets, multiple locations.

Or you have bitpay act as the credit card processor during checkout, and you offset the credit card price by the value of the btc that you send them during sale.
