I get what you are saying and i think you are right but i also think that there are always two ways to look at every situation. No side is 100% right so you have to find the benefits of both sides to create a system that enables those while at the same protecting against the proven negatives that our current system has as well has 'imagine' how past negatives could be manifested in the new system and then create protection around those things. 
There are definitely negatives to sharing personal information but i also think there are a lot of positives. The principle idea that my logic is based on is maybe something that i didn't articulate well enough. There are basic human needs that have proven consistent when you look at how/why societies evolve and they both can fall into the categories of opportunities and protection. We should never rely on any one system to fully protect us nor should create a system that creates unlimited opportunities without any oversight. 
I understand your concern for decentralized processes and how they can run ramped but thats assuming the worst just like on the opposite end how regulating monopolies have protected us against fully centralized processes. We already have created regulation that acknowledges the risk monopolies brings to a complex system of trade due to the unpredictability of human behavior. Thats why they are not allowed. Same can be made for the decentralized side of the spectrum. Regulations can be created that prevent a forever extending system of untethered opportunities but that will make us unstable just like relying on one single process makes us unstable. 
I feel like you logic is accurate from more of a generalized perspective which can limit complete understanding because of how generalize thoughts keep a perspective settles on the surface instead of diving into a deeper understanding of the concept. When you dive deeper you become aware of the whys of the matter and those you can begin to work around.

Thats why a decentralized network using Blockchain could be so impactful. I agree with your government concern. Thats mine as well but there are ways to hedge against those concerns using Blockchain. Getting people to understand that however is more difficult because its hard to 'prove' network security in a way that the average person can understand without much effort. 
It will take time before its adopted by everyone but eventually it will be because math is way more predictable than human behavior and the one thing all humans can agree on is that we all value the ability to predict outcomes accurately.

Could this be an attempt to 'clog' the network or does this much volume help the network?

Thats the irony of the 'big data' collecting business. The information is everything and the more customers you can 'collect' the more customizable and enjoyable you can make the users experience and resulting in potentially more customers and more data. Their incentive is to build trust with all of us so we use their services and give them access to our information. If they don't then they won't survive because their customers will go somewhere more trustworthy and so will their data. 
Its not the data collection that we are all worried about, the the use of the collected data. We don't trust how it will be used but thats only because we've been shown how it can be used against us. But we've also seen how it can be used to benefit us. So its natural to try to initially protect ourselves from the bad but overtime we will all become more comfortable with it but first it needs to build trust.

I'm not. I was a business major and now I'm an entrepreneur. I'm curious is how the world works because i like creating businesses that are likely to succeed so understanding why successful business are successful is important to me. Philosophy and math/science play a role together like a dance back and forth. Philosophy promotes science which then promotes newer philosophies. In order for it to become science, someone had to think of it first. 
So if we can create a new philosophy for some new technology we can begin to use it in ways that are consistent with the world we live in.

The only reason governmental financial systems are a threat are because they have been used in ways that have hurt the majority of the people it governs. If it was reversed would be so eager to change it?
My 'pseudo-mystical nonsense' is meant to illustrate that we depend on higher systems of organization for our survival. Trust in those organization is what we have lost but saying we don't need them is ignorant and only stalls real progress.

The government needs people to protect. It can't squash everyone like a bug otherwise they would have no one left to control. There will always be a higher power trying to organize us and at the core of being a human being, thats what we want. 
The only thing every human has in common is some belief of a higher power or process that is organizing everything we experience on earth. We naturally want to believe that there is something out there organizing our lives in a way that we can trust. TRUST is the biggest thing. Not the threat of a higher power organizing it for us. As we become more intelligent we want to control more of ourselves but at the same time there are still so many things we don't know that we have no choice but to chalk it up to a higher power/process.

I understand what you are saying but i didn't mention anything about the IETF being "in charge" of anything. I used the word "directing" to mean that we choose to implement their ideas that they direct us to using. We don't have to but we trust their direction because they have a higher level of knowledge thats required to come up with practical changes. 
Don't you think these sorts of groups are needed for every major process that influence ever major industry in the world? So we need some level of centralized guidance to help us get where we all want to go. Its just we've never had a way to hold the people we trust accountable because of the complexity of the world we have created for ourselves. But centralized guidance is necessary for all of us to operate at efficiently as possible. 
The challenge is HOW do we create a system like the IETF that allows the guidance of people we can trust to be organized and implemented while also holding them accountable. The Blockchain allows for that system to be created but instead of us creating that system, most people here spend time arguing about things like blocksize and why decentralization is good and centralization is bad. Maybe thats just the role of reddit in all of this. Meanwhile i would assume the IETF's of the world are organizing their own systems into blockchains so that one day they can all be linked together very efficiently. That will allow for all of us to live in a much more connected world but at the same time people will realize they were focusing on the wrong issue and the centralization of certain processes will be a part of the blockchain in some fashion. Making sure certain processes can be held accountable in a way we can all trust and that they don't get over centralized is the key to building the most effective and trusting blockchain network. At least thats how i currently see it.

Is that any different than the circle jerk that you do with the people who think in a similar way as you? The high level IQ idealists have these conversations behind close doors because people shame their ideas in public. So people just sit around complaining with like minded people in what could be considered a 'circle jerk' manner never realizing that its the act of complaining itself that is keeping you from getting ahead.
Its a vicious cycle and trying to explain it sometimes feels like trying to teach a dog not to lick its own dick in public. I don't speak dog but i could probably beat him into behaving the way i want to. That would be much easier than trying to teach him without putting him to shame.

Wow, thats awesome i didn't know that. 
So isn't that a good thing? We want groups like that directing important aspects of our world don't we? As long as they are doing it for reasons we can trust will make the world work better?

The irony.
Why are you shaming someones attempt to understand something as complex as trying to figure out blockchain technology could effect the entire world? 
Before you can change something for the better you have to take the time to understand it. However, that is hard to do and its often frustrating so we like to resort to shaming people because that will get them to stop. Stopping someone is way easier than attempting to understand them. The irony is that we always have the ability to do both and its the one we choose thats the most telling about the kind of person want to become.
So like most people on this subreddit, i would assume you are a fan of bitcoin and want it to succeed in hopes that it would make your life better also. If thats how you feel you should encourage people who are trying to understand it further instead of shaming them because you can't make sense of it yourself.

Its not about the size but its about the technologic process that makes bitcoin 'scary'. Kind of like a cancer thats starts off as one cell. Our bodies won't recognize any difference if it has just one cancer cell in it and as long as the body knows how to manage its growth then theres nothing for us to worry about. But the ability for it to rapidly expand quicker than our body can adapt is what makes it so threatening to humans. Blockchain technology is like the one cancer cell. Alone its nothing but its ability to impact the things around it is unprecedented.
Making sure that it effects us in a way that benefits all of us is crucial. Kind of like a small dose of the flu allows for you body to build up antibodies for that virus which is helpful. But if you gave your body too much of the flu virus it would have a negative effect on your body.
