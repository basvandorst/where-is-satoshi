I deployed Bitcoin donations for Pathways to Education, which is a charity based in Canada. I can pass along some briefing notes and a slidedeck I used to introduce Bitcoin within my organization. If you message me your email, I'll send you some more info. If you're interested in checking out what is set up, you can read about it here: [
