[Here]( is a photo that can somewhat explain it, in short unless you actually tell them (another person trying to get your private key) then there is so little chance they could crack it that it is infeasible for them to ever be able to.

If you would like to donate to a newcomer then anything would help so much so I could purchase more hashing power!

If you plan on spending around 2 grand you could try to get into mining, but for the average joe it's not too profitable at this point.
