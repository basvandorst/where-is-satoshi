@_date: 2019-07-03 03:47:07
I think it's more insidious on top of that.  Newly created money in a inflationary system inherently goes to the well connected, and they get to spend the new money at the old prices.  Meanwhile, after the money has moved sufficiently through the economy, everyone's else's savings are depleted via the increase of prices.
@_date: 2019-07-16 12:35:55
I wouldn't count on the supreme court or the constitution as protection against any sort of ban.  The federal government has long since been regulating anything and everything (including outright bans) using the commerce clause as justification, and this is backed by several rulings by the supreme court.

@_date: 2019-07-06 13:06:38
The people who benefit the most from inflation are the people who receive the money first and can spend it at old prices.  In our system it's banks, the government, and big corporations.  Real estate might appreciate nominally, but the actual value doesn't necessarily increase at all.  That, and the damage done to the larger economy, e.g. wealth being extracted from the middle class and transfered to the well connected, will hurt everyone and destroy wealth long term.

I'm no legal expert but a Ponzi scheme, like Madoff ran, seems to me to be a pretty cut and dry case of financial fraud.  You're telling your customers one thing (that the money you're giving them is profit accrued from their initial investment), when it is in fact something entirely different (new capital taken from other investors)...  Not to mention the countless number of fake, manufactured financial statements that Madoff gave to his customers.  I don't see how it's remotely possible to use accidental mismanagement as a defense in a case like that. Pretty sure that'd be fraud no matter how you sliced it, with or without regulations.  Your claim that what he did would be legal is a pretty ludicrous one, IMO.

I don't see this happening, ever.  That would be the equivalent of putting shackles on government spending and excess.  The only way any government would adopt sound money is from pressure from their citizenry. 
In your hypothetical, Ukraine is MUCH more likely to issue it's own fiat paper notes because it makes it so much more easy for them to finance their revolution.  In order for them to obtain bitcoin or gold they'd first have to buy it / tax it from their citizens.  Just because they declare something as their currency doesn't mean an abundance of it will magically appear in their country and in their pockets.  For example, even during the revolutionary war, and our own civil war, when people were still extremely skeptical of paper money... the continental army and the confederates quickly turned to issuing paper money.  Why?  Because it was so much easier to pay for things that way than it was to tax specie from their citizens.

I think that to the extent a person is able to abstain from the immediate consumption of their income, thus is that person's capacity for the improvement of their condition.  This is universally applicable to all human beings interacting with their environment;  from wealthy people in developed countries to those living in the 3rd world.
Any policy that discourages savings is bad, especially for the people who already don't have a lot of opportunity to do it.  But if you're trying to make the argument that there are people too poor to save; I think you should reconsider.  A person too poor to save would have to be expending all of his effort towards receiving only enough value in return to sustain the original effort.  The only places I see where people are close to anything like this condition is in places with more oppressive regimes who discourage savings even more by violating people's property rights and other direct acts of violence.  Man faced naked against nature has the capacity to save.  How else would we have been able to advance at all without it?  So in order for a person to find themselves in a situation where savings is not possible, there generally has to be some kind of political force involved preventing or discouraging it.

Eh, I think this point of view is a bit overstated.  Its great to beleive in bitcoin and all that, but if its going to succeed than its going to take a lot more than just people's beleif.  The fact that there's an economic incentive to invest or transact in bitcoin is awesome.  The people getting involved solely for this fact should not be shunned but embraced.  It means it has real economic value other than being a group of tech savvy libertarian's pipe dream.  I'd even go as far as saying that the more people who are using bitcoin solely for their own profit, the better.

Actually, many libertarians including Murray Rothbard hold that fractional reserve banking is a form of fraud and should be treated as such because they promise to honor their depositor's withdrawals without being able to do so.

That is just wrong.  While it may be low; of course there is a cost to producing software.  Labor being the biggest one, but even harddrive space is/comes at a cost.  I could go on and on, but just those two are enough to show that certainly the cost of production is not $0.

It depends on how you define deflation.  Different schools have different definitions of deflation.  If you go by what the austrians say, you're correct.  They define deflation / inflation as either decreasing or increasing the money supply (respectively).  Using any other school's definition would make you wrong though.  They generally define deflation as a fall in prices, or an increase in the value of money.  Bitcoin has increased in value over the span of its existence, making it deflationary.

Just because the dollar has increased in value relative to other currencies doesn't mean it has increased in value.  So I don't see how a DXY chart invalidates my statement.  And a TY Chart is so irrelevant to the value of the dollar that I'm not going to bother going into it.  The way you measure a currency's value is to by looking at its purchasing power.  [How much can you buy with it?]

they're most likely converting it to fiat immediately.  I doubt they're paying their suppliers in bitcoin.

I think that depends on who you listen to / who you believe.  There are wildly varying schools of thought on the matter.  Whether or not a mild rate of inflation is good and/or necessary for growth is a very contentious and unsettled topic.   During the 19th century we saw the greatest economic growth in history and during that period the dollar doubled in purchasing power.  There's also the 1970s stagflation (high inflation during a period of poor economic growth).  The government, being societies greatest debtor, is the main beneficiary of an inflationary system.

Sorry if I was condescending, I'll answer your question in more detail:
To 'wildly fluctuating interest rates' I would say that I have no cause to think they'd be "wildly fluctuating" at all.  Does the price of socks wildly fluctuate?  The interest rate is a price (the price of money) and acts like any other price in the economy.  The main problem, that is solved by switching to bitcoin, is when governments institute price controls and fix interest rates via central banks.  This creates malinvestment and booms followed by busts (recessions).
The great depression was one such episode.  Easy money and credit 
Policies of the federal reserve (created in 1913) created a bubble which fueled "the roaring twenties." In 1929, this bubble burst.  Free market economist, Ludwig Von Mises predicted this crash.  Much like free market economists predict the ones of today.  After the crash, government intervention started by Hoover and expanded during FDR is what prolonged the depression.  It wasn't until government spending was massively cut post world war 2 that we were able to recover.
@_date: 2013-07-29 00:16:23
He used it correctly.  In economic terms, inflation simply means rising prices, and deflation means falling prices.  The OP said, "price of BTC inflated.". Which is referring to the price of btc in USD.. Which did indeed rise (inflated).  Now, if he was referring to something priced in BTC whose price had fallen due to the increase of BTC's value... THAN deflated would be the proper word.  For example, "Cocaine's price deflated massively when it fell from  10btc to 1 btc..."

truth.. depends on the reason for change.  it could be because bitcoin is increasing in value because it's being more widely adopted, or it could be because the dollar is losing it's value

I can't for the life of me figure out why any reasonably educated person would think that just by mentioning the great depression it would raise unanswerable questions or defeat those who are in favor of 'unregulated capitalism.'  There's an entire school of economic thought in favor of free markets and sound money; they have studied the great depression and other historic events in great detail.  You act like there is no dissenting opinions and everyone agrees that the great depression was caused by free market capitalism.  How very naive of you.

I think the most important job of any miner, is to try and convince everyone else that getting into mining is a bad idea and to just "buy and hold" instead.
I have no clue if people actually do this, but if I was mining...I would probably be one of it's most vocal bears and cringe every time I saw a post like yours.

He needs to AT LEAST go by current exchange rate if he actually expects people to pay using BTC... $200 / btc is too overpriced.

Sorry for the confusion but I didn't know how else to say it.

Can't you just call the bank and check?  Or get an e-statement?
I don't think you need to wait for any email they send to you.  Once the amounts show up, than you can sign in and verify the account by entering in the two amounts.

It actually makes sense for businesses to give a discount for btc.  Lack of transaction fees, no charhe backs, and the fact that its appreciating in value.  You haven't been able to say that about state issued currencies pretty much ever

no it's not bad at all.  I'd get giddy as a mother fucker if I found a $5 bill on the bus.
Of course the people who find those flyers probably won't know, but they're much better off finding one of those than a $5 bill.  While the purchasing power might be the same right now... the USD is pretty much garunteed to be losing value as time passes, where as BTC will most likely either retain or increase it's value.

That's just wildly not true.  There were many paper note issues done by the United States long before the civil war... starting with our fight for independence.  Havent you ever heard, "not worth a contentental" ? That was born during the rampant inflation of the revolutionary war.  History is fun
You're overall point still stands, paper money / inflation has long since the preferred method of financing war by governments.

Satoshi wrote the code but doesn't have any real power over the value of bitcoins in peoples wallets.  He could say whatever he likes and It wouldn't have any real effect on bitcoin.  Bernanke on other hand has real power over the entire financial system.  He controls the printing press and so by extension controls each and every US dollar you own.

yeah, I don't really understand why you got down voted there.... 
Pretty simple shit... if the demand of a good rises relative to it's supply, it's price will increase.  This has already caused the price of btc to rise exponentially.  The types of gains you mentioned aren't far fetched at all if widespread adoption really takes off in the future.
Maybe you got down voted cuz although what you said might be true, we all love to talk about how much it's going to be worth a few years from now and it's repeated incessantly on this subreddit.
