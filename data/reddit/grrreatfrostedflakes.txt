Look at all the shady stuff that goes on with fiat, and there are literally thousands of pages of rules and laws.

How ‘bout you regulate deez nuts.

People noting that crypto has been used for criminal activities is literally the most stupid argument against it I’ve ever heard. The entire world of corrupt politicians, drug lords, corporations, drug dealers, etc. has forever existed and operated using fiat just fine.

Unless you spend $10,000 + on a decent home safe, they’re relatively worthless. Do some research, the safes that big box stores sell, including gun stores, offer little to no protection against a thief with minimal skills.

It won’t and can work that way in the long run. Some will succeed, but other must crash and burn.
@_date: 2017-12-28 17:14:28
That’s fair. Just good to be aware that the average safe nowadays is not a safe you should trust to actually protect valuables.

That’s fair.

But how do you really feel?

“No I KNOW”
Truth be told, you have NO idea what the future holds. Don’t be so arrogant.

Tell us about “the things” wise one.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:00:55
Your argument makes you sound stupid. All of the criminal activity you noted existed and thrived long before crypto utilizing standard fiat. The currency can’t commit a crime, you dumb fuck.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:00:47
Super creepy.

What model? It’s likely the standard $1000 garbage gun safe. Better than having nothing though. They all have x levels of fire proofing and redundant locking bolts that add no real security. It’s just marketing.
Here’s a good place to do some research if you’re actually interested  -

It’s what may eventually kill crypto 
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:26:58
Interesting. Not sure if I’d trust a bank though.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:32:52
So you’re a millionaire now? Good for you.
@_date: 2017-11-26 14:07:15
I’m not trolling. I was genuinely wishing you well. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:28:28
Does this comment you made make you feel sad?
@_date: 2017-11-26 08:57:31
Yes, why not do it. It’s only $50. Buy and forget about it for a long time.
@_date: 2017-11-26 15:37:50
Very cool. I wish you the best.

Is it still the early adopter stage now, 3months later?
