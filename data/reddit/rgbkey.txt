Right, I just said what I remembered at the moment, and I have a feeling that again, they (bitrunner) would put a lot more thought into this than a game with no real value like ingress. Read the indiegogo page more thouroughly, they have plans on how to combat it.

Correction, not Google. Google sponsors the game, but the makers are Niantic. I emailed them about this question and they gave the same response gave. 


I have faith that they will get this sorted out as it's mostly their money on the line. On the kickstarter page it says that the money will come from small business partnerships and in game purchases is what funds the coins that get placed in the game. They have incentive because hackers will ruin the game, nobody will enjoy it and will stop playing, and there goes their revenue stream.
Please don't doubt people because they use kickstarter to get funding. They have on their advisor list the CEO of blockchain.info, and many people that appear to be qualified for the job.
After a few emails back and forth I would trust them to do the job correctly.

Sorry, but I'm going to have to call you out on that one. Not only is this not impossible without an android device, if he had printed the second page of his backup it would have included full directions on how to get the private key from the encrypted private key and the 15 character password.


and verifying an encrypted private key. The description is quite technical and
allows a developer to create software that allows you to decrypt your private
keys. This allows you to access your funds if the Mycelium software is no longer
available. If you wish to read or review the implementation used by the Mycelium
Bitcoin Wallet you can find it here:
Parsing The QR Code
1. Scan the QR code to get a Base64 encoded string.
2. Decode the Base64 encoded string to get exactly 46 bytes. The Base64 variant
 used is designed for URLs as specified in RFC 4648 section 5.
3. The first 3 bytes are the the magic cookie 0xC4 0x49 0xDC: decoded[0...2]
4. The next 3 bytes are the header bytes: H = decoded[3...5]
5. The next 4 bytes is the random salt: SALT = decoded[6...9]
6. The next 32 bytes are the encrypted private key: E = decoded[10...41]
7. The next 4 bytes are the checksum: C = decoded[42...45]
Decoding the 3 Header Bytes
1. Regard the header as an array of 24 bits and decode the following values:
2. version = XXXX???? ???????? ???????? (must be 1)
3. network = ????X??? ???????? ???????? (0 = prodnet, 1 = testnet)
4. compressed = ???????X ???????? ???????? (0 = uncompressed, 1 = compressed)
5. HN = ???????? XXXXX??? ???????? (0 &lt;= HN &lt;= 31)
6. Hr = ???????? ?????XXX XX?????? (1 &lt;= Hr &lt;= 31)
7. Hp = ???????? ???????? ??XXXXX? (1 &lt;= Hp &lt;= 31)
8. reserved = ?????XX? ???????? ???????X (must be zero)
AES Key Derivation
1. Make the user enter a 15-character password using characters A-Z, all in
 upper case. Convert the characters to 15 bytes using normal ASCII conversion.
 An implementations may use additional checksum characters for password
 integrity. They are not part of the AES key derivation.
2. Run scrypt using parameters N = 2^HN, r = Hr, p = Hp on the password bytes
 and SALT, to derive 32 bytes.
3. The 32 output bytes are used as the 256-bit AES key used for decryption.
Decrypting the Private Key
The decryption function is 256-bit AES in CBC mode.
1. Generate the AES initialization vector (IV) by doing a single round of SHA256
 on the concatenation of SALT and C, and use the first 16 bytes of the output.
2. Split E into two 16-byte blocks E1 and E2
3. Do an AES block decryption of E1 into P1 using the derived AES key
4. X-or the initialization vector onto P1: P1 = P1 xor IV
5. Do an AES block decryption of E2 into P2 using the derived AES key
6. X-or E1 onto P2: P2 = P2 xor E1
7. The 32 byte private key is the concatenation of P1 and P2: P = P1 || P2
Generating the Bitcoin Address
For each bitcoin private key there are two public keys. A compressed public key
and an uncompressed public key. As each public key gives a different bitcoin
address it is important to use the right one. The right public key to use is
encoded in the header (compressed). Bitcoin addresses for the test network are
different from the production (real) network. The network that this private key
is for is encoded in the header (network).
Verifying the Checksum
1. Convert the generated bitcoin address to an array of ASCII bytes
2. Do a single SHA256 operation on the array of bytes
3. The checksum is the first 4 bytes of the output
4. Verify that the calculated checksum equals C.
If a wrong password was entered the checksums will not match.
Cryptographic Functions Used
AES - 
SHA-256 - 
scrypt - 
(Line breaks are broken because of reddit's formatting)
Second of all, if you always use a format usable by all clients, it makes it even easier for someone to steal your coins in a situation exactly like this. I guarantee if they just posted a plain private key it would have been gone a lot sooner than it took for this to happen. The QR codes are simply there for conveinice, and to use for verifying backups on mycellium.
