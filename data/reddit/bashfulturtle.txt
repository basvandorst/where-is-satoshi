The public perception of insider trading isn’t aligned with corporate insider trading.
Insiders are defined. You can be a low level analyst and be an insider. If you get paid in stock and someone up the food chain fucks up, you should be able to cash out.
Trading volume always spikes before IPOs for a reason.

Been monitoring the trade logs religiously for awhile - no way he could liquidate 1700 at a single strike price. Absolutely no way. The largest order I’ve seen filled at a single strike was 7 but coins. He would need to liquidate in a block sale that would amount to giving the wallet to someone. There are obviously issues with this. They can’t be worth 25.5mm if you can’t liquidate at a single price. When that enormous liquidity hits the market, prices generally crash.
This is partially why institutional investors see this as a commodity.

Don’t even bother, it’s a commodity with great marketing behind it. Forks prove that.

Some generous grades there for btc, especially with this kind of volatility.

Yikes, are you in high school? You’re fixated on this FDIC thing when thats not even the main reason why a run on cash won’t happen again...
This sub used to have people who actually had understandings I’d economics, finance and banking. Just go take a single damn class or read a book on it if you’re so interested. View it as understanding what to avoid. I’m sure you’ll read it and then come back to delete this comment.

Oh my goodness. 
You actually think recession = run on cash. Yikes. If you make dumb, non-researched comments people are going to treat you like you’re dumb.
Check out what happened to capital after the last recession...oh boy. Banks are fundamentally different...you know what, if you couldn’t be assed to do an iota of research (which is blatantly obvious from a comment that was PAINSTAKINGLY addresses after the recession for YEARS) then you don’t want to know the truth. 
I’ll stop you there, that cannot happen again with the current capital requirements by virtue of initiatives like LCR, tiered capital and RWA methodology. Just do yourself a favor and at least look those up. This is really just a sad misunderstanding of our system.

It’s hilarious you can’t see the satire here.
How many puffs from your vape did you take while writing this?
You don’t understand finance so stop being a black swan. It’s moronic to suggest this is going to happen. 100% certainty? Please. 
@_date: 2019-01-07 23:09:53
Do you have a source for that? 
I can tell you with 100% certainty it won’t happen.
See how easy it is? I work in the industry and hold degrees in this stuff. All predictions to date have been wrong. Tell me why this is different. 
You sound like a marketer. With language like that, you’re clearly not in finance. What gives?
If you have an inkling of what price discovery is, this should be extremely concerning to you for many reasons -

This is a horrible headline and a factually incorrect article, BOA is talking about shifting focus away from brick and mortar. 
A lot of banks only compete online and margins are higher. 
The note on bitcoin specifically is about not accepting them as insured deposits. Had the author even a tenuous grasp on finance, he would’ve noted about how it’s more related to federally insured deposits and complying with capital regulations (this moron doesn’t even note this, if you can’t talk about how it affects cet1 capital then you have no business writing an article - this is a false prophet). Bitcoin does not work in the mandatory federal capital framework for many reasons - but that’s more a reflection of how stringent capital mandates are. 
Nothing wrong with digital audit logs, but this article just isn’t explaining this well at all. 
BOA and any bank would LOVE to take your money in any form. The problem is that daddy (the Fed) doesn’t want them to and will cut off its help if sonny boy banks go for bitcoins. Without daddy’s help, all of your operations get frozen and you essentially can’t operate in the US with any feasibility until you pay the piper. This is a government problem that is all very much on record. 
Get your news from better sites. Random college kid reading about 10ks for the first time isn’t going to tell you desirable information. Go for real analysts with track records.

You skipped all the substance to make a random reply. I explained why, this joke at the end feels very awkward and forced in this context. 
I told you several ways that the run on cash has been addressed. With significant detail. 
For whatever reason, you chose not to understand a topic you’re unfamiliar with. That’s your choice and mine is to not bother. 
@_date: 2019-01-08 03:28:39


So no. Just take 1 class about what banking actually is if you’re so interested it. At worst it’ll help you understand how to profit using alternatives to it.
But you won’t find any.

Hilarious to read that people are afraid of this and opting to hold so much volatility instead. It’s a non-sequitur.

This is an attempt at an eli15:
Federal regulators made banks the strongholds of the economy after the 2007/8 crisis by forcing adherence to minimum levels of assets deemed very safe in an overall asset allocation sense. These are weighed against liabilities to make absolutely certain that the bank can pay these liabilities and have money left over to operate fully. At a very high level, the riskier the assets on your balance sheet, the more secure liabilities you need to have as assurances. 
Consumer deposits can be backed by the FDIC as the golden standard of safe liabilities to plot assets against (even though this thinking is certain to change in the coming years). They’re extremely secure for the bank and basically count as a premium in stress testing. That’s why many banks offer you cash to open an account and hold a minimum amount over time. You can clean up doing that. 
Bitcoin’s value risk/volatility/fluctuation is unfuckingreal, trades outside of business hours and is not well studied. The federal regulators already called it a commodity. There’s absolutely no way they can be considered as safe deposits in their current state. Extreme volatility in assets deemed unflappable is how we got into the 07 crisis.
This author is off in lalaland drawing weird connections to buzzwords that don’t hold water.

Thanks for the link, good read. 
There are a lot of problems to that, but our race fixes these problems over time.
I’m just commenting on the present state. As to the future, I expect virtual to bob along until a credible federal force backs their own and lets it be counted as fully insured common equity tier 1 capital. That is the point in which I see banks assuming it.
Very skeptical that blockchain technology not owned by the fed will be supported.
