Sure buddy.. gold is going to zero its a tulip bubble..�� better ?
@_date: 2018-01-20 23:04:18
The only reasonable use of tether is to move your bitcoin to it if you are trying to avoid $$losses if bitcoin is losing value and then trade back to bitcoin once bitcoin price has stopped going down. Making a profit .. i believe idk that's how i see tether being used .... for people who cant or don't want to trade to actual dollars

Lol I've been in this space for years..what makes you think I'll be shook !! Please  I laugh at this dip ��
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:21:24

Idgaf spelling is not very high on top of my list you disrespectful person .... go and buy some bitcoin futures go long or short it's up to you ... if you don't like the idea of a DECENTRALIZED world currency!
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:58:18
If you would like to be left behind I would suggest to not buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 03:45:34

@_date: 2017-12-11 07:36:45
Nice keep on buying and Hodl..when your 21 you might be in a really nice position.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:40:42
Yeah I would slightly just remind them on family gatherings. Just wearing some bitcoin clothing would suffice.. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 04:49:35
Because if i didn't Hodl like a month ago when everyone was saying it was a bubble at $7000 I would of lost a lot of profit but more importantly would of lost my bitcoins!! Wich are more important then all the profit i would of lost but I'll Hodl and when at $50000 per coin i will still Hodl!! The goal is to Hodl until bitcoin is widely accepted!! Not sold for cash !!! 
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:26:12

@_date: 2017-12-09 20:20:30
Yeah I was wondering the same ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:30:30
Yes they are!! Can't blame them to understand the technology one has to be really wanting to do research and learn about it ..wich takes time and most people don't have that kind of time to spare I guess !
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:54:06
Now plotting on how to take rush  spot

Diabites is a hell of a drug!
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:12:04
I'm not impressed at all with your FUD! Have you heard if lightning network ? More innovations are to come that are being worked on as we speak ... if it goes down to 5k my gains will still be large so I see no problem in that ... futures are a way for cementing trust in BITCOIN to regular people who are easily fooled by institutions bankers and media... Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:01:45
.9 btc 
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:07:16

@_date: 2017-12-10 04:37:21
Just hold !!! Trust me it will be much higher!!!
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:28:33
You don't get it bitcoin was created to be immutable!  Decntreliazed for people by people not a company with datacenters or centreliazed locations!! DECENTRALIZED 
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:22:49
Yes it would ... Jihan is the main player behind that scam ... Roger is second and anyone who supports them are crazy to think that garbage coin will take over bitcoin . Delirious 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:11:24
Lol I'll give you one day max and then you'll be checking your investment every 30 minutes!
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:21:28
Excellent !! App would recommend 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:02:50
Yes it's satoshi has the creator but we don't know who he is .. that's best for a decntreliazed currency no leaders ... the whole bitcoin community me you we are Bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:10:15
Lol what you don't even know your bcash superiors lol do some research you'll see CEO of bcash is that Sweden politician that supports child pics 
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:46:06

@_date: 2017-12-21 00:57:40
Fuck coinbase use gemini.com or bitstamp
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:17:44
Yeah but if it does go down that =cheap BITCOINs for everyone that belived and understands the technology.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:24:43
Electrum for desktop....but I would be very careful using a desktop computer for storing BITCOINs. Virus and hacking are more common with desktops ..if it's no a large sum it'll be ok but just be cautious with all your web surfing and it will be ok 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:10:43
Lol there is no one person or company to place said regulations on .. it's DECENTRALIZED for a reason no one is in control the whole network is controlled by consensus of the majority of us the users!
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:52:20
Yes he knows about investing stocks and all that other stuff but he doesn't  understand bitcoin so that's not relevant.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:13:41
Fuck coinbase 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:03:46
Lol please remind me in 2 years when bitcoin is worth 10x what is worth now atleast  !! Please

@_date: 2017-12-03 06:24:29

@_date: 2017-12-04 05:44:04

@_date: 2017-12-03 06:40:26
Miracle would be $50000

@_date: 2017-12-10 15:37:12
This is 100% true
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:29:18
It's evil and because of insider trading they knew that they were goin to allow bcash to trade and told several people and started dumping bitcoin and bought bcash right before they officially announced bcash live for trading. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:27:38
Yes manipulating the market ...working against bitcoin and pushing some scammers agenda or shitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:31:14

From my last halving the price rose from like $250 to $400 at the time when the reward halved and everyone was saying that the $400 price of bitcoin was already priced in since everyone knew about that there would be less bitcoin available to sell.. but a month or 2 later price kept on going up and up ...so I see another price increase in the next halvening.
@_date: 2017-12-02 03:31:21
Lol you don't get it ... watch Andreas videos on YouTube.. he can explain it a million times better than me.

The most secure and most trusted blockchain and most tested.  And last but not least bitcoin is the defacto crypto... if bitcoin would fail now so would every other crypto ...reason as to why because it's still an early technology and thus would bring all the others with it ...once it gets past early technology then you can ask why bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:19:06
Lol you don't get it bitcoin isn't supposed to have any owners it's not bitcoin if you can just go to Jihan and Roger lock them up and that's it no more bcash ... what the big deal that is the big deal !!! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:19:49
Yes right now there is a limit on how much you can dive it ...   .0000000001 or so there's no need to make it even more divisible yet ..when the whole world uses bitcoin maybe we will make an upgrade to make it more divisible to whatever much is needed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:28:18
Crush btrash !! Hopefully Roger and Jihan and every single other Bcash supporters sold all their BITCOIN!!

Lol yeah and to be controlled by 2 or 3 people with CEO's yeah thats satoshis vision alright /s not no mention the orchestrated pump and dumps and attacks against bitcoin and slandering on financial news television attempting to hijack bitcoins name .but that's expected bitcoin has to be strong against any attack. Bitcoin will survive regardless 
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:20:08

It's a clock that shows when the reward miners get gets halved... miners get rewarded 12.5 bitcoins around every 10 minutes to whoever finds a block .... in July 2020 the miners will get 6.25 bitcoins for reward meaning that less BITCOINs will be coming in the market to sell ...less bitcoin more demand

@_date: 2017-12-11 06:17:05
Yes you get 1:1 of coins split from bitcoin  .... The forked coins are suppose to add some type of adjustment to the original bitcoin and once a specific block is hit it'll split and become a new chain with it's own miners. To split those you will have to wait for them to give you a detailed way on how to do this it can vary depending on where your coins are stored...if you have them on an exchange then it's up to them if they will give the forked coins to you.

Bitcoin is not a token bruhh
@_date: 2018-05-06 19:58:02
Well I didn't explain it good enough... here goes with better explanation... Lmao "popular" as in bcash .... monero litecoin and even ether are more popular then that pieces of ��... So if your going to use anything other than bitcoin by all means  use the popular Alt coins. Not no malicious alt coin being pumped and doing everything it can to cause confusion to new people getting in and wanting to buy BITCOIN and when they do they end up buying bcash because the bcash camp has a full blown confusion camp going on. Media news paid trolls u name it they are doing it. Saying bcash is BITCOIN bitch please. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 20:09:09
Yeah just transferred not stolen BITCOINs are always in the network never moved just transferred around with keys. But regardless there several  way to have 0%chance of losing BITCOINs. Easily hideable piece of paper or just words and a pass phrase easily done. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 04:05:04

@_date: 2018-05-02 17:21:02
Mycelium was the best app. Until you guys decided to not upgrade to a much much needed software upgrade Segwit. Samourai is now the best wallet. Mycelium u are a trash wallet. 
@_date: 2018-05-02 18:33:19
Segwit is a bitcoin upgrade. Helps with the onchain transactions. Lightning is a second layer. So you don't care about the bitcoin network now ? Why would you not upgrade to the latest software wich helps bitcoin as a whole and as u can see users demand this from you guys. Simple ... users the majority of us are what make bitcoin not the small percentage that went with that scam coin malicious bcash .. maybe u should support bcash if y'all don't care about bitcoin and it's users.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:01:31
We will return Just a little patience!! Is all

@_date: 2018-05-25 21:39:34
Yeah I'm saying this in my point of view there is very very low chance of me losing my coins or stolen due to my extremely precautionary nature. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 03:17:45
Ok understandable but the truth is that weed is and should be legalized just as alcohol and tobacco. The drug laws are way too old and need an upgrade.
@_date: 2018-05-05 19:55:14
Bch is a malicious alt coin 
@_date: 2018-05-05 23:10:57
I know all this bruhh ... It's a little disrespectful to compare bitcoin with all the other tokens specially bcash  . Bitcoin is the fuc*** blockchain.
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:20:49
Why  try to even comment on this subject if u don't have a clue what is going on ???

Buy the dip in November or December of 20k+
@_date: 2018-05-06 18:48:52
Because anything is better than bcash even dodgecoin or garliccoin literally anything even fiat cash money is better or the same. Moral of the story use anything other then bcash if you are not going to use BITCOIN wich I highly recommend but Alt coins are easily pumped and you guys love it since they are cheap compared to bitcoin. But that's just my 2 satoshis. 
@_date: 2018-05-25 21:19:10
You make some great points. But like I said there are several ways to protect your bitcoins from being lost or stolen simple and not too hard to achieve. One easy crude example would be write 'etch' seed on a non corrosive metal bury in back yard and pass phrase on the other side of the back yard secure and simple not as hard that's one of my easily executed examples.
@_date: 2018-05-02 03:40:19
Can confirm
@_date: 2018-05-05 20:02:32
"Popular" lmao �� heard of monero or litecoin or even ether .. that's popular .....edit compared to bcash any other Alt coin is popular even garliccoin is a better coin then bcash
@_date: 2018-05-25 19:49:40
Well technachly bitcoin can't be stolen 
@_date: 2018-05-06 16:58:05
Lmao Fuck bcash use litecoin monero or use BTC Bitcoin I could care less about monero ether or litecoin or bcash they can all fail idc ...I care about  Bitcoin!!!! not the copy malicious controlled governed China coin bcash.
@_date: 2018-05-25 22:03:04
True I guess I see why some people choose not to be their own bank and keep their bitcoin in exchanges .. sure some of those are like banks for BITCOINs I suppose.
@_date: 2018-05-06 06:57:15
Lmao I've been in the community over 3 years and everything I've spent 100s or 1000s of hours researching and understanding BITCOIN through out Theese Years.. I'm sure I know that bitcoin is the fucking blockchain and without bitcoin your malicious altcoin governed owned coin bcash wouldn't exist and easily fooled individuals like u to accept bcash. 
@_date: 2018-05-11 10:33:43
Buy buy when that happens... and for your info this is BITCOIN!!! One month or 2 from now easily over 10k idk even want to guess end of the year price.

@_date: 2017-02-09 12:51:33
If true then it's not too big of a deal and any one implementation should be fine. So I assume you will also be joining Segwit as the facts show that businesses and projects stand by Segwit.
@_date: 2017-02-01 02:26:41
I love the enthusiasm!!! To the moon !
@_date: 2017-02-23 03:45:20
Segwit +lightning and then a 2 mb hard fork= problem fixed for us users ..for miners not so much I guess they want the most fees to make more profits. Greedy miners 
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:32:52

I thought this guy quit bitcoin why is he still posting ?
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:56:43
Ok there is more then enough time to figure it out in the mean time Segwit and lightning and a couple mb hardfork ...About what u said block reward is a fee ...I'll happily pay to keep BITCOIN running. 
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:31:01
It's straight disrespect

I second this 
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:34:04
You sir are a dumbass stay at r/btc.. your mind can't seem to wrap around the fact that Segwit is for the best of bitcoin not some way for core to destroy Bitcoin. Segwit activated = $2000 and higher price BU hardfork = a couple of $100s price 
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:42:37

@_date: 2017-02-03 04:36:47
Easy peasy lemon squeezy bet it will be at $1000 stable eventually then stable $ 1100 then stable $1200 and so forth it will always go up and down up and down but stable at a certain amount and then up and then down guaranteed ! ! I stand by this message!!
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:55:56
So theese aren't facts ?
@_date: 2017-02-28 18:39:58
I blame miners that are greedy ...they are loving Theese high fees.. from their perspective why upgrade short term profits are great 
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:19:34
That was hilarious !!

We're leaving the ozone layer!!
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:55:09
Ok you kind of makes a point.. but how things are now days with everyone devided one would use more caution  since Trump supporters are kind of the minority when it comes to this political stuff "protests" 
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:11:15
Bet 
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:48:45
It does but what makes no sense that they claim they're not getting support from businesses and projects to fear of being attacked in openly supporting BU.

Yes we'll have that volatility but it always has in my experience always returned up and continue up! Always! Like when we hit $1150 earlier this month so by my understanding always right so far we will be back at $1150 and stay there and go up just a matter of time a month or 2 but we'll be there and that price will be stable for a while then go up and then down and up and be at a higher stable price  proven hypothesis proof last 2 years !
@_date: 2017-02-07 07:07:36

They back on the lending program?
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:08:12
Ok it's like there are not going to be no transactions made on the BITCOIN network... the way I see it lightning is just a way to be a full fledged currency that will take on visa .....how many mb will that be with only BITCOIN network ..half a gigabyte..i imagine a huge amount of mb ..the storage needed to protect the network running a node ...the amount of bandwidth needed of to relay the transactions to other nodes ..there is a cap on bandwidth by the way with most providers 
@_date: 2017-02-07 08:03:30
Ok time will tell.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:23:25
I'm being realistic that's all. But what do I know. News coverage are lies I guess trump supporters don't get attacked or  herrased I guess I'm watching alternative news lol
@_date: 2017-02-03 01:36:45
If anyone is going to accept bitcoin in its early days, it has to be these guys!

@_date: 2017-02-26 15:59:43
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:03:48
Bitaddress.org is were I generated my paper wallet address. First make sure u go to bitaddress.org and once page is finished loading disable the Internet connection and generate paper wallet offline. Also u can download bitaddress.org to use offline on a device that will never touch the Internet for security reasons. You can also make wallets with a passphrase.
@_date: 2017-02-07 02:39:06
You probably created 2 accounts one were the 18 dollars are and the second with 580 why did u do if you don't know how to use it since your new idk. Go to accounts and you should see the other account.

@_date: 2017-02-09 17:56:48
Yeah I did start of with mycelium android phone with one btc I wanted more so I figured out how to use paper wallets then I wanted more BTC and got a trezor !

It's political one party seems to be butthurt r/btc the other one is just trying to do its job and help bitcoin scale.
@_date: 2017-02-04 16:56:58
True mostly everyone in Bitcoin favors Segwit. 
@_date: 2017-02-03 04:59:23
Get it straight from the source actual keys that you control your Bitcoins!
@_date: 2017-02-03 00:56:34
I disagree to disagree 
@_date: 2017-02-22 01:14:32
Yes one of many reasons mostly because it's a new way to hold value and use as a currency, that for thousands of years have been mostly kept the same until now !!!
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:57:48
That guy Vitalik is an ashhole!
@_date: 2017-02-05 19:03:48
Thanks I tried been doing some reading at r/btc and posting. That's one of my conclusion thus far.
@_date: 2017-02-09 06:05:49
I'm just trying to get the info from pro BU but that's all I've come up with so far

You sir are a joke 
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:15:32
Miners loving it no wonder Segwit hasn't been activated !
@_date: 2017-03-06 05:02:59
Ok i get that segwit does double block size lime ...but would it hurt to also do a 2mb block size after Segwit gets implemented just curious I'm all Segwit! I can't see what's wrong with also 2mb block size afterwards !
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:08:53
I don't know subway accepted bitcoin ? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:36:24
Uses will decide by signaling nodes..im on board to run my Segwit node !!
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:25:44
Yes let's activate it already !!!! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 17:03:59
I'm just saying this guy should focus on ethereum not on bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:04:10
It will overcome this and come back stronger like it has plenty of other times on different situations but it always has !
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:55:05
Looking forward to Segwit being activated and hopefully somehow Jihan wu destroys his mining company we don't need him !
@_date: 2017-02-02 22:18:33
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:32:06
Lol one miner Jihan wu is the BU firepower!
@_date: 2017-02-07 03:16:23
Lol right we might make it to the front page!
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:39:54
Ok I'll get a node running and support Segwit since I'm not a big China miner.
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:04:39
Hahaha it's been a  money tree for me for 2 straight years idk but I believe in money trees!!
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:05:47
They have power but the users also have the same power. If 90% percent of users want Segwit why not allow it to activate. This one guy Jihan wu is slowing down the Segwit activation since he controls a ton of hashpower wich clearly is not favorable with the large portion of users so fuck him!
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:02:23
Learn shall I  oh mighty supreme  leader Kim Jung Un  I mean Jihan Wu !
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:02:28
If miners are working for their interest and don't care about users interests there is a problem.. so we resolve this problem with their support or without it since they're  not listening to our demands and our interest so miners are working for us and were making bitcoin valuable so we need them they need us even more 
@_date: 2017-03-20 02:21:48

@_date: 2017-03-15 02:33:06
Its obvious have you not been paying attention to this bullshit "war" ... that guy is the main provider for all mining hardware ..he controls a shit load of hashing power. Like all the BU support right now is all him - 5% or so of that !
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:47:36
Fuck this bitch Jihan wu !!!!!!
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:45:48
Uasf fuck them if they don't want to cooperate!
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:10:42
Yeah I feel the Same way but I highly doubt that BU gets 75 % !!
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:35:24
I'm a user and stand 100% behind Segwit!
@_date: 2017-02-08 22:04:02
Chinese miners are lazy .
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:45:47
Like we don't have a monopoly already lol idiot ...heard of China man Jihan wu ? The largest mining hashrate % and provider of most of the mining hardware and supreme leader of BITCOIN atleast that's what he's planning with BU ...and BU BU far is the one not properly tested every month well have a bug and cause loss of trust on the BITCOIN network .. 
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:00:08
Who was the original guy that came up with Segwit?
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:48:21
Uasf I will run my Segwit node!! Jokes on you pal!
@_date: 2017-02-04 04:18:46
But be on the lookout for the Winklevoss Bitcoin etf that is being reviewed by the SEC waiting on approval this March is the final decision I believe. Look it up for more info.

@_date: 2017-03-17 05:29:52
Go for it good luck! I'm sticking to Bitcoin Hodl!!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:26:31

@_date: 2017-03-01 22:08:29
I like the dedication way to risk your freedom you criminal !!Lol I like it !!
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:54:54

@_date: 2017-03-18 21:06:35
Im hodling through this drama!! My Hodl game too strong !!!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:30:49
Wtf if I could mine and be able to compete i would instantly ..and I'm ok with the fees as we speak I'm ok with the supposedly  "high fees and bitcoin is dying because of fees " all I'm waiting on is Segwit... 
@_date: 2017-03-04 17:12:09
Ok I thought like the organization as a whole. Ok thanks 
@_date: 2017-02-09 04:50:50
So there's no businesses or projects openly supporting BU? 
@_date: 2017-03-10 23:06:32
Hodl it'll eventually surpass that price months or years but we going past that price easily !
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:42:02
So case in point there are many many times more users than miners ..do they not reliaze that and possibly consider that they are not the ones running the show !
@_date: 2017-03-15 19:10:16
You don't understand that several miners control huge amounts of hashrate ...all individual miners combined are a small %
@_date: 2017-03-19 05:05:19
 Lol I'm all for BITCOIN if the majority of miners make up their mind and go full BU so be it ...but I doubt that will happen .. so I'm all Segwit and Uasf since miners have shown they can't make important decisions that are for the best of interest for us users and them long run!!
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:38:40
@_date: 2017-03-06 22:53:56
Haha and what other miners are joining your great dictator?? 
@_date: 2017-02-24 04:21:08
Stay humble and send me some bits !! 
@_date: 2017-03-17 11:11:14
Lol judjing by prices $100 dollar drop that's normal with  BITCOIN . Eth $30 dollar increase not bad but bitcoin can get that in minutes ..Hodl!!
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:56:52
Do I have to create an account to bet ? Or just press bet and put my BITCOIN address and send amount?
@_date: 2017-02-09 05:20:26
Why? if it's the better choice why not support it ?
@_date: 2017-03-06 23:32:38
Lol no one that supports Segwit would even think about participating on that crap !
@_date: 2017-02-05 01:30:48
Haven't seen this in my area and there's a couple of btc  atms close by 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:49:53

Lol this guy is drunk !
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:10:47
Sure but u do reliaze that the majority or all internet providers have a cap on how much gigabyte are used monthly...as we speak 1mb block size limit for nodes to share and broadcast transactions the  bandwidth needed is like what close to 1 terabyte monthly! So that times 8 
@_date: 2017-03-15 17:15:53
Your talking about mining against million dollar enterprises how is my hashpower going to affect anything?
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:49:09
I like Segwit I'm an average Joe user nothing special other than I use the BITCOIN Network !

Idk the details regarding this ...but I'm sure someone will look in to it 
@_date: 2017-03-17 03:26:03
My Hodl game strong !
@_date: 2017-03-15 05:34:35
Very true. Unfortunately some miners are greedy as fuck and can't see past the profits that high fees are bringing...so to that us users have to do something about it !
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:10:28
What's wrong with competition ...Bitcoin will prevail !
@_date: 2017-03-10 18:08:54
Tyrone is that you !!  Buying some more rocks after etf decision!��
@_date: 2017-03-16 02:59:11
Because of the high fees they are loving it !!! And there is a UASF user activated soft fork that has got some traction going since miners don't want to cooperate!
@_date: 2017-03-12 00:01:41
Idk but it would take a long time to recover the initial investment of hardware and panels ....ask the mining sub they should have more info..
@_date: 2017-03-18 21:04:14
Buying some more BTC as we speak and Hodl 
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:03:51
Sir not everyone I'm a hodler haven't even flinched through this!!!
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:20:42
Lol I just got it ....Aguatna!! Hodl for fellow Spanish speskers!!
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:33:39
I'll stay here I can handle all this drama .. ultimately bitcoin will triumph!
@_date: 2017-03-19 07:21:22
Idiot miners will keep control what capacity to run...miners will want high fees for more profits ...nodes in this case will not help raise block Size.... Uasf to activate Segwit will!!
@_date: 2017-02-04 23:48:49
Lol well you didn't mention nothing about the other word used  quadrupled !
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:27:31

@_date: 2017-03-06 22:52:15
Your an idiot for posting this crap.. do you really believe this is a legitimate poll ��������
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:12:30
@_date: 2017-03-19 06:25:51
Fire the miners for network implementation..keep for security !!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 20:20:08
Ok but this is an insignificant amount compared to large mining operations check Jihan wu he's the provider of most mining hardware and mining hashrate ...if u say that small miners as in users are the majority Segwit would already be implemented !!!
@_date: 2017-03-10 05:06:39
Yeah ...it's not much anyways ...just for fun and giggles...you on the other hand are a true gambler or have plenty of btc laying around !!��
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:43:13
Segwit is the clear option in moving forward now!!
@_date: 2017-03-04 04:27:28
I'm not interested in the price now. I'm interested in the price in 5 to 10 years !
@_date: 2017-03-14 17:15:46
We need to show them that we also have a voice !
@_date: 2017-03-07 11:57:15
Users as just as important as miners if one dictating bitch named Jihan wu wants to stop the will of is users fuck him !!!
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:58:31
Your right r/bitcoin is where the majority of bitcoin community comes from.
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:36:10
I don't know about that maybe who knows ?
@_date: 2017-03-19 04:26:56
Users hands are bound ...fuck that !!!
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:05:43
If 75% get BU support I guess they're the winners o will support it .. but highly doubt that happens but in the mean time Hodl and support segwit and Uasf!
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:27:23
I'm a user i stand 100% by users wants so fuck it miners had their chance it's up to us now !!
@_date: 2017-03-07 17:24:28
Let's do it !! Fuck Jihan Wu!!!
@_date: 2017-03-14 03:05:48
BITCOIN is safe it wasn't bitcoin that got compromised it was the stupid exchanges that hold you bitcoin that don't have appropriate security or an inside job by employee! So if your not daily trading bitcoin you don't leave BITCOINs in exchanges. You keep them in your secure wallet !
@_date: 2017-03-01 16:38:03
I love the up trend why be negative it only has been on an upward non stop trend the past 2 years!!

"Miners are running it " Jihan wu and maybe another miner!
@_date: 2017-02-23 04:22:12
Yeah I see what u saying but there is a block reward I'm not sure but I believe that alone is an incentive already...and security by only fees will happen in what 100 years or so when we reach the 21 million BTC
@_date: 2017-03-18 04:11:22
My Hodl game is too strong ... unfazed!
@_date: 2017-03-17 05:13:58

Why because I'm true believer the technology and I see it helping me with my financial state and helping me save $$ since I buy and hold and don't like to touch it hence I'm young and when the time is right I will need it not now though !
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:12:58
We need the miners for the security not to dictate by themselves what the protocol should run but also by users wants. They are just as important as us this guy seems to have forgotten that!
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:39:12
All I do is Hodl!!
@_date: 2017-03-15 11:14:34
Lol Jihan wu ��
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:44:46
Yes we need them to secure the network not to undermine the users interests!
@_date: 2017-03-10 11:50:52
Bandwidth on the other hand though is legitimate concern!
@_date: 2017-03-10 02:55:49
True if it does drop wich I doubt I will be running to get some more coins !
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:38:47
Plus I've been steadily bashing on those guys there for a while mostly arguing with them in a more civilized manner but non the less l get easily careless and go full retard! its fun ! 
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:43:28
He'll yeah I'm up for I'm on the user side since miners don't care about what us users want !
@_date: 2017-03-08 12:51:18
Fuck china
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:47:11
Well I can only afford to run one node so that's what I'll do. This is better than miners thinking they own bitcoin !
@_date: 2017-03-18 14:03:45
Bye bitcoin is not for the weak !@
@_date: 2017-03-17 15:03:17

@_date: 2017-03-14 04:05:26

@_date: 2017-03-17 04:56:36
Solo se que BITCOIN es la moneda virtual !

no thank you
@_date: 2017-03-17 02:45:01
I'm getting the hardware to start my Segwit node ...pne question though will the node have to wait to download the whole blockchain in order to signal Segwit?
@_date: 2017-03-05 05:51:28
To keep the security of BITCOIN.
@_date: 2017-03-11 23:57:33
Your too late to the mining party mining is done by large corporations with millions to invest in mining hardware
@_date: 2017-03-16 15:44:24
We do need them but they need us more 
@_date: 2017-03-05 06:25:00
So miners that want Segwit? I only know of this guy Jihan that wants BU ..i assume all pro Segwit miners will mine with favor of the uasf not to mention it will be more % then BU miners.
@_date: 2017-03-24 04:27:10
Lol I was too hot to handle !! Sizzling ��

Nope not premined he sought out to some people to help and run the network.. from day one anyone could mine bitcoin! Bitcoin is not premined like ethereum or many other cryptos that followed. They chose to get coins before everyone else because they want to profit from it satoshi was never about profit it was about a revolutionary monetary freedom. Get your facts straight.

@_date: 2019-08-21 05:00:13
potential for the halving that's coming up in the next months to a year is way greater than the short term. we are talking about all new time highs
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:35:02
new investors jumping in possibly with the news that Facebook is making its own "crypto coin" and feel more safe to invest maybe..but we are closer to the halving and I'm sure you're aware of what began on the last halving!!

True but most likely all the bcash bag holders that lost on this manipulated pump will reliaze they were duped by Roger Jihan and company !
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:12:36
Would definitely use some of those stock gains and diversify in bitcoin. But how much of that to invest in bitcoin idk your call.
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:27:24
Basically you will be transacting on the lighting network ..and will be able to do microtransactions. Like .001 cent or .0000001 of a cent micro and fees will probably be around the same .0001 cent or so ..but imagine billions of transactions at .00001 cent...... check out the links posted on here for better explanation 
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:21:23
Bgold is the competition to the malicious bcash ! 
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:04:46
1 CEO of bcash says fuck you while the other CEO "jihan wu" says fuck your mom if you want fuck. Bcash owners need some anger management classes!

@_date: 2017-11-16 04:14:48
You split the coins ... trezor has the full step bybstep on how to do this.. then simply send to exchange and get BITCOINs .... I'm not sure if gdax supports that lil bch though. I used ShapeShift.io to shift my lil bch to BITCOINs.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:36:30
My Hodl game too strong! BCH please Lol

Segwit bro it's an upgrade. You good 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:29:34
Hodl is my only advice 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:06:35
Because you have 100% control of your money unless you have them in an exchange. But basically we understand that money is created out of thin air and banksters are somewhat at blame for the creation of all that debt. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:44:18
Lol you do realize that guy who sold his house for BITCOINs already has huge profits. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 05:00:33
Doubt it 
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:44:56
Cool ....for the future if you do purchase a miner just try and not buy anything from bitmain ant miners! ✌
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:05:31
If you had bitcoin before the fork when bcash split from bitcoin ..then you do have some some equal amount of what you had in bitcoin ....off my head I don't know the exact date when bcash forked..i want to say around August 10 or so ...google it and you'll know the date 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:54:55
Well if you doing all that with $6 might as well send me a small donation lol

@_date: 2017-11-19 06:47:37
An app on android or ios
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:51:56
I would recommend to use a pass phrase..its more security in case your 24 word seed gets compromised... but make sure that you store the pashphrase separately from the 24 word seed and make the pass phrase is extremely strong and long..... also when you add a pass phrase this is not temporary it's permanent if you happen to lose or forget your pass phrase but still haveyor 24 see you will still lose all BITCOINs that you had stored with the pass phrase... think of it as the pass phrase being the 25 word of your seed. Hope this helps

What if you have it password protected?  Will they ask you to unlock it ? Can't you just decline ? Because that's what I'd do. I have my phone encrypted with a strong password ? Regardless I wouldn't keep $10000 in bitcoin in my phine unless .2 bitcoin turns out to be worth $10000. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 06:24:41
Yes bitcoin is decentralized not governed...and Theese few people try to change some rules without the majority of the users behind close doors. With out consensus and that's why it failed because we us the majority of users are BITCOIN!!!

It's a second layer network .millions of transactions will be able to be processed on top to the bitcoin network. The current high fees will be used to open or close the lightning network channels only by wich billions of transactions would had been made. So that's the solution to our scaling problem. One of the many innovations to come

True .. I still yet stand to be corrected.. my true and still running hypothesis if you will. "Once an all time high has been breached and then hit a bump and crash down.

@_date: 2017-11-27 14:50:00
Get a hardware wallet ..trezor I would recommend...gdax.com is coinbase with less fees.. or gemini.com ....they are secure and as soon as you receive BITCOINs get them out the exchange if your planning to hodl unless your willing to pay the high fees on getting them instantly with localbitcoins.com 
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:36:58

It's a malicious alt coin spreading blatant lies and trying to steal BITCOINs name ... they are scamming people in to thinking they are buying the real bitcoin .. plus bcash is owned by a few people the total opposite of what BITCOIN stands for ...so that's why we dontblike bcash ...any other Alt is welcomed since they aren't trying to mislead people calling themselves bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-11-09 05:07:43
Don't forget to mention to the new guys that bitcoin cash is governed and controlled by 2 or 3 people. Jihan and Roger and centreliazed going against everything Bitcoin stands for and why bitcoin is so valuable today. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 10:44:59
Miners .. nodes solely help secure the network by keeping track of every transaction ever processed .. there's mining facilities all over the world that are industrial sized meaning million upon millions of dollars have been invested in the sole purpose of mining bitcoin s and the they get rewarded 12.5 bitcoins around every 10 minutes . It's a competition who can find the next block to be rewarded .. with anyone can participate in mining via 'joining a mining pool 'you can but just have to invest in a good mining rig and calculate your electricity cost and if whatever your rig mines is profitable against electricity cost.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:30:58
I don't care much about bcash now after what the big pocket guys did the past 2 days fuck Jihan Roger and company.. but common dude you are low key siding with them you must be blind if you couldn't see or admit that the pump was a scam 2 days it went from what $500 $600 All the way to $2500. With no user base whatsoever. Just my opinion but don't fall for it if your a new guy 
@_date: 2017-11-16 03:21:47
If you can afford to get 1 bitcoin do it now! I don't see bitcoin not doubling again  by next year.  With the institutional money coming in soon before the end of the year ..

Hey atleast you can help and secure our network and join slush pool since they only mine bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:09:10
Because miners and a few people are trying to change an upgrade without the consensus of the majority of the community ..that being us the users ! It sets a precedent that a few people governed bitcoin and this bitcoin can be manipulated by governments or entities with ill intent .. Bitcoin goes against everything about being govern that's the sole reason bitcoin is what it is now! 
@_date: 2017-11-02 11:12:50
And to top it off an etf next year ? Moon or mars !
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:08:04

Extremely safe !! I've had my same wallet on several devices for a few years an no compromises at all. You just have to use caution and not get some type of virus malware. I recommend samurai wallet. Don't store more then $1000 $2000 At most.
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:52:11
Invest small amounts every week or 2 weeks or month ! If you save up for a whole  bitcoin by the that time 1 bitcoin might be worth $10000 $15000 $20000 . Who knows but if you start investing now those 200 could turn in $400  $500 $600 in a few months or years.
@_date: 2017-11-01 02:03:08

Not on bitstamp!
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:14:38
No one really knows what price it will be ... but if your in it to make a quick buck fast you might not be rewarded...but if you're in it for the long term atleast 2 or 3 more years you will be rewarded plentiful! But to secure your coins I would recommend buying a trezor hardware wallet. It's one of the safest way to store your coins offline.  Trezor.io is the website 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:25:07

You get both chains and then you can decide yourself wich chain you want to sell and wich one to keep ... Bitcoin wich has segwit already implemented is what you would want to keep not the new segwit2x chain. Since you are newb just Hodl were you control your keys. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:58:08

Trezor is a hardware wallet meaning your private keys are never put online. That solves getting your computer or phone hacked and you coins stolen. All you do is set up your trezor, copy the 24 word seed ,very important in case of loss of trezor or damage , will be able to recover BITCOINs back with any other wallet or device. And added security add a passphrase. Store the 24 word seed along with passprhase somewhere extremely safe were no one can find it. Get creative ... ok when you plug in trezor it will ask to put a pin code wich is also recommended to add ...onve pin is put it will ask you for pass phrase. once that checks out you are able to secure spend move or add coins in to your account without worrying about being hacked even if your computer has a bitcoin stealing virus. I've used trezor for years I highly recommend.. if you have small amounts of bitcoin like $100 to $1000 you can use samorui wallet or Mycelium wallet they are secure.

The value comes from the use case! It's decentralized trustless immutable. Not governed by no one no government. You the owner of bitcoin are in full control  you are your own bank. That is valuable .. currently undervalued as we speak.

Undervalued at the time .. once more and more people realise this. 2015 not as many people knew about bitcoin as 2017 hence the $250  value then to $4000 now and less and less bitcoin is available since then.

Meh $4000 still undervalued from my perspective and still not enough adopters other than early adopters. Bubble now would be $20000 $30000 as of now ..but should be worth way way more with time and adoption and innovations. Time will tell.

Fair point that's why I have a few monero. Bitcoin is with team alt coins crypto currencies as a whole &gt; fiat money. But bitcoin is the defacto crypto currency. If bitcoin were to fail so would most of the other coins.

@_date: 2017-09-24 20:02:17
Yeah it's a temporary dip it'll be up there soonish!
@_date: 2017-09-04 01:05:22
I'll look later also I'll let you know.. But yes get a trezor it let's you set the fee at whatever you want. I moved 2 BITCOINs earlier with a .12 cents fee and confirmed 3 minutes later! 
@_date: 2017-09-10 15:36:04
Idk 
@_date: 2017-09-28 19:15:13
Lol true!
@_date: 2017-09-19 03:54:50
No I didn't sell them that it was a  good investment! I just told them about the freedom it provides and how a revolutionary technology it is! Didn't ever tell them buy some and you'll make money. I took advice from a  post or comments here to never push bitcoin to no one specially family or friends because of the mt gox where people who did push to their family and friends ended up with a bad relationship. I've never tried to convince anyone about bitcoin i just tried to informed them about and let them make their own decision . I did say to some extent that this is the future of money and the internet of money but  Unfortunately for them as of now they didn't do anything. So too bad for them. And about using it daily. I don't more like 2 3 times a week.. I feel excitement when we hit all time highs no fears when we dip because I have a hypothesis if you will or proven fact? But it has always been true and I truly believe in this technology regardless. That once we hit an all time high and then dip below that all time high we will always always come back and beat that all time high ! Just like this $4990 or $5000 all time high we will eclipse it. 2 years this has been true! Bitcoin doest need to be pushed on no one.

Chill .. this economic major doesn't understand anything other than fiat currency. He's blinded and doesn't see the new technology that bitcoin is aka blockchain. Just like the internet in the late 80s early 90s. Very few people saw the potential.

Very true indeed. Bitcoin energy vs all banking and financial systems is not even comparable.  1% or less of what they use to what bitcoin uses of energy! 
@_date: 2017-09-16 03:13:41

@_date: 2017-10-13 01:21:07
Well it can. That's why there's lots of information and why everyone that's been around helps newer people by telling them not to keep all of their bitcoins on an exchange .. we are way better prepared for such events .
@_date: 2017-10-05 09:10:03

True UASF would activated Segwit and idk if bch would be BU bullshit unlimited.
@_date: 2017-09-09 09:39:34
Ok i see fees not as in transaction fees to move your coins in the bitcoin blockchain. Use gdax I believe they have cheaper fees .. coinbase owns gdax it's the same thing but cheaper fees.
@_date: 2017-09-14 02:16:21
True I'll wait it out. Innovations and much work but the technology is revolutionary!
@_date: 2017-10-09 18:12:33

@_date: 2017-10-16 04:07:24

@_date: 2017-10-13 03:34:39
Well I guess if you have $100000 dollars in the bank and a good job you can snail your way with 1% 2% gains in a year.. no so much for the majority of people that don't have near that amount to invest. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 00:17:40
Maybe it's due to their CEO tweeting about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-05 02:12:54

@_date: 2017-09-13 04:24:17
I guess . But my words stand. Always end up at an all time high after previous doom and gloom scenario or death of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-20 23:31:16

@_date: 2017-10-13 04:38:39
Could be right . I have no clue but I'm leaning on that there will be a correction here in the next few days that's all I can hypothesize 
@_date: 2017-10-06 21:13:13
Yeah not worried at all I don't reuse my addresses so that's that I'm safe. Plus upgrade to quantum computer safe cryptography and back to business

@_date: 2017-10-13 00:25:56
If you sell now and hope the price goes down you will get have more then 4 bitcoins or less if the price continues to go up.

@_date: 2017-10-13 03:26:21
The trick is not to sell when it dips just Hodl and you'll come out on top!
@_date: 2017-10-28 03:56:17
Only reasonable explanation to you is that your and old fart that is not aware of the disruption that's coming to the financial system.. what the internet did to the fax machine what email did to mail ..bitcoin will do to your precious financial system you are just trying to stall the disruption! Too bad you can't and it's coming sooner than expected.. Your like professor bitcorn he said ..by next year bitcorn shares will be trading at $10 per share ������ what a more idiotic comment coming from non other then an actual expert �� are you also an expert so I can cry in tears �������� regardless I already am !!!!
@_date: 2017-10-18 15:16:39
Hodl in a few years it will be worth way much more!! Sell your BCH coins . 8 of those coins get you around  $2500 right now.  
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:13:21
If it goes against what you believe then go to r/btc
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:28:22
You can .Just make sure to buy lower and not buy back at a higher price. 
@_date: 2017-09-19 02:28:31
That's a lie! Out of every person I socialize work or have any day to day interaction .. doesn't know what bitcoin is or would understand it. My guess 50 60 people. I've told 4 or 5 about it but they haven't grasped the concept of it or really looked in to it. They just know it's worth way more then when I told them about it ..but it's too expensive now for them to purchase. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:10:39
@_date: 2017-10-26 04:52:44
None 
@_date: 2017-10-15 21:55:00
I'm not to sure how coinbase is handling that. You might want to ask their customer support department.
@_date: 2017-10-03 23:42:32
I'm willing to add to this 1 bitcoin. I'll trade  1 segwitx2 for 1 Bitcoin. Any takers.
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:24:03
Ok i need more education on investments. Thanks I'll holler at you when I get ready to dip my toes in the index fund. If ever ..need more bitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:22:44
Look dude... coinbase is sticking with what the majority of us users want... the market clearly says that the x2 coin is not bitcoin..people are selling the shitvoutvof the futures bringing it lower and lower ... if we wanted that then there would be no futures to sell. Ok bitcoin is controlled by us the majority of users we don't have a Vitalik run development ..we don't need one

Mycelium did not implement a way to get your bch coins.that said if you were holding your coins when the fork happened you can still get your bch coins.. there's some wallets that implemented bch split. Research wich wallets allow you to split coins.. I used trezor...i split my coins after a few days
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:50:33
I got lucky and sold all my remaining bch before this rally on Sunday!

Wtf no. Bitcoin mines a block around every 10 minutes. Each block mined gets rewarded with 12.5 bitcoins.  Every 4 years that block reward gets halved so in around 3 years the block reward will be 6.25 every block that gets mined so less bitcoin will be put out in the ecosystem. Less bitcoin available to be traded so more scarce so more valuable bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-14 02:35:05
We fee like you're better off buying BITCOINs! Unless you have zero knowledge on how bitcoin works or not  tech savvy and would have a hard time securing your bitcoins. Other then that buy BITCOINs. 
@_date: 2017-09-13 08:53:18
Times have changed . When it went to 1000 the first time it was a fake price with mt gox exchange faking the volume. Since they had lost all of the BITCOIN they held and were the largest exchange at the time .... today price is not being faked by one exchange something catastrophic needs to happen on order to go to 1000s like let's say the world's governments all together have banned bitcoin and you can get locked up for using world wide. Something like that ...wich is highly highly unlikely .. so you are terribly wrong .. lowest has being hit lower $3900 is the lowest we went ...your calculations are plain �� though ... try again maybe $3500 low lol

Depends what country. USA  Gemini or coinbase. I believe you need to wait to be verified takes days or weeks I'm not sure. There's other services where you ca get BITCOINs instantly but charge high free around  5% to 10% ..bitcoin ATM, libertyx.com, localbitcoins.com

Lol  loud we will see 
@_date: 2017-10-12 03:06:56
Yes it's true... You will need to wait for the fork and your wallet provider instructions or most will find a way to safely get your forked coins. Unless you have them on an exchange were it's up to them if they are going to give you the forked coins or when they will. Like coinbase users still haven't received their bcash coins from a month or 2 from their split. 
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:38:57

@_date: 2017-10-06 22:05:30
Hodl and all you will see is gains of course not short term.. a year or 2 will probably have or close to doubled said investment.
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:47:25
Good that'll save you a post here about how you got your bits stolen.
@_date: 2017-10-16 18:36:09
Current currency is created out of thin air! Bitcoin is new technology where before it. There was no way to transfer money around the world almost instantaneously without having to trust anyone. DECENTRALIZED immutable and not governed by no one. No need for Id ssn background check nothing... will help the non banked also 
@_date: 2017-10-16 04:03:22
Yes there lots of scams like cloud mining don't invest in that also ...holding is best ..or buy low and sell high ..it called timing the market ..trading. But it's hard i hear 
@_date: 2017-10-13 00:11:26
If you don't need the money now or for short term.. Do it but if your trying to make a quick buck you might be disappointed.. long term your investment will double triple just a matter of time that be one year 2 or 6 months no one knows but one thing is certain Bitcoin will continue to grow and be more valuable. Your move 
@_date: 2017-10-13 03:55:56
I see. I don't know much of how the typical investments work I've been fortunate or spoiled  with several %100 or %1000 percent gains thanks Bitcoin.

I sure wouldn't I'll use the hell out of bitcoin. But in the mean time all I do is Hodl and buy some more.

@_date: 2017-10-22 06:28:52
Dude just to give you my perspective.. I started in 2015 at $250.. I just kept on reading everything about bitcoin and I realized the potential for this currency and in the process I got a Hodl on what fiat currency is really like once I grasped all that I kept on buying all the way to the couple of $thousands. All I can say is I couldn't of have made a better investment in my life! 
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:30:46
