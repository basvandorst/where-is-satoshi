Great communication and support. One of the few Bitcoin businesses I trust completely!
I did manage to check my wallet address a few mins ago - and my balance came up as double... Gonna assume that was a temporary glitch...
@_date: 2014-03-03 18:27:05
At least its back to being entertaining!
@_date: 2014-04-12 18:59:30
Lol, did I seriously just see lorem ipsum on the homepage? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:46:03
Oh - and another lesson I've learnt the hard way - caching is king. Don't want to be hammering API's too much..
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:41:16
It is indeed. Good work guys. Give the devs a biscuit.

Upvote for visibility. I used coinbase on an ecommerce site but we hold the bitcoins. I think you can cash out in dollars to a UK bank, but I suspect it's slow and involves fees etc. Would also be interested in a UK friendly bitpay alternative.

I work for a digital agency involved in sites that receive 20,000 plus hits a day. I've seen us make FAR bigger balls ups that this.
The amount of times I've seen console log messages for example is ridiculous, alert dialogue for QA, sensitive information contained in comments etc. etc.
While I'm not quite falling for this - a stray comment in the source could easily be a noobie dev cock up.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:47:35
No worries - good luck and hope it goes well!
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:44:13
He has commented on every coinbase related thread. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 13:59:33
Heheh - beware the wilds of the Bitcoin sub... You might do better in talking price.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:06:41
Personally I use the blockchain.info API - but check them all out and see whichever fits best for your project. If you want to show 'sell' prices - maybe sensible to use the exchange your users are most likely to see on.

If you're looking for USB ASIC miners, at  we sell the AntMiner U2 which has a hash rate of 2.4 GH/s per unit. We ship worldwide and are happy to offer help and support to beginners. I myself run a number of the units on  Raspberry Pi to keep power costs low and run the units 24/7. But you can just as easily attach them to your PC and mine whenever it's switched on. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 14:03:38
Ah another U2 man! I manage to sneak in a few comments about my setup here and there... but much better suited. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:59:38
Out of interest have to you dealt with many bitcoin related (non gox) issues in the past? 
@_date: 2014-04-03 10:06:27
Oh people learn - but only the hard way.
@_date: 2014-01-23 08:12:11
Cheers for the clarification dude. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:39:30
Looks like its sorted now.
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:29:33
That's a fair point. given gox's incompetence - I wouldn't trust them with a 1 satoshi wallet though!
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:47:58
I suspect only a limited number of people have access to sensitive information. If that info is leaked, you've got a pretty small pool of suspects 
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:03:43
I'm a comparative noob (I hope) compared to the guys running exchanges - and my wallet is backed up in about 5 different places!

Not sure you can tie up exchange behaviour with btc in general? It seems this tweet only relates to a Ukrainian bank - so while a translation would have been helpful - not actually essential given the contents 
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:23:43
Used them myself in the past but found them a little expensive. I also see the cash option didn't last long? Always been a speedybitcoin man myself.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:33:05
Ahhh 'user error' :) Upvote.
I've found them faultless myself.
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:23:55
Its the order book of the given exchange. Top is sell - bottom is buy.
Disclaimer - I think I know what I'm talking about - could be completely wrong.
@_date: 2014-04-14 15:51:08
Fair play mate - admitted your mistake. Always worth a good cross browser QA session before you put something live. Not gonna pretend I've never left lorem ipsum on a site...
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:04:24
I can imagine you'll be pretty busy in the coming weeks / months! All the best to you.
@_date: 2014-01-23 13:45:50
Any thoughts on why? Biggest ltc/btc shift I've seen in a while. Tempted to buy in again. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 17:01:29
where have you seen this?
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:46:25
Sounding like this isn't btc related?
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:03:51
 you've used a responsive template with different content on the tablet breakpoint. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 14:01:06
Latest news post from btc-e is pretty encouraging. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:45:10
Hmm - what's your interpretation of this - no withdrawals to traditional banks?
@_date: 2014-02-12 14:12:28
Seriously hoping it comes back to life as it was - I'm not sure I know my password...
@_date: 2014-04-07 14:37:35
Thanks! Was a long afternoon writing that! Hope it helps! 
@_date: 2014-04-01 12:51:25
Tbh we're planning on just selling our BTC on localbitcoins when the prices is at a level we're happy with. Though this isn't really an approach you can suggest to a retailer if your hoping to get increased adoption. What's really missing is a reputable exchange that deals with UK banks.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:29:18
He also confirm that leak (presume you mean the slideshow?) was not produced by Gox. Which begs the question - who did write it?
@_date: 2014-02-28 16:10:58
Upvote for visibility. Interesting insight.

Seems like this fella has a plan of some sorts?
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:34:08
Mate of mine had a couple of those 1 satoshi transactions as well. Suspect this is unrelated.  
@_date: 2014-02-22 16:45:26
Same jump on most exchanges it seems...?

We've just received word that the first shipment on AntMiner U2's has been dispatched and will arrive this week.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:52:12
that is true, and also why you encrypt it.
@_date: 2014-01-22 15:45:34
actually lol'ed at that

Big green dildos!!!!!!!!!!!!!
@_date: 2014-02-10 14:12:29
Personally - I think if you buy today - in a months time you'll be laughing.
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:24:16
Or you can just hop to this - 
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:08:38
@_date: 2014-02-12 16:36:04
Do you think this is something more likely to happen because of wider adoption of the currency - or as a result of wider adoption? 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:46:02
Actually lol'ed. You guys win customer support.

Still getting login issues on Android app.
@_date: 2014-02-25 13:56:37
Yup! I was struggling to explain it before all this nonsense! 
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:47:19
Yeah worried me at first given what's going on with the other exchanges - from the help people have offered so far it doesn't look like its btc related.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:05:46
I'm saying I'm going going to put much faith in the theories of someone - who despite all of the signs of insolvency - was prepared to DOUBLE their losses! 
Trying to be sympathetic mate - but that's probably one of the worse business decisions you could have made - in any context. Would you have bought shares in a company which was rumoured to be insolvent?
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:28:38
If I were them I'd be pretty worried about leaks... There's gotta be a balance sheet somewhere right! Don't get me wrong I'd love to know more about the situation - but can't quite seem any Gox employees coming forward in a public forum. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 16:39:10
All looking good now.
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:21:00
I bet they're all up to their eyeballs in NDA's at this point
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:45:47
Yeah cos receiving a payment request is clear proof they're all crooks... 
@_date: 2014-04-06 12:42:31

Now in stock and ready for next day delivery. All pre-orders have been dispatched. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:04:07
LOL 
@_date: 2014-03-23 18:14:37
After getting a few Q's by PM from the UK post -
AntMiner S1's will be delivered in 3 - 5 working days. Delivery is free to anywhere in in the US, Canada, Europe, Europe or Israel.
Expected delivery date for the AntMiner U2's is the first week of April.
The AntMiner U2 price will be increasing after the pre-order period

What every one has said about profitability is correct - but personally I've only ever mined bitcoins for a bit of fun. Its a good learning exercise -  and if your interested in Bitcoin its a good way to learn more about it.
Bottom line is with your setup, its never going to be profitable - so I wouldn't worry too much about the maths - it will only depress you!
To answer your Q's though - 
1. Wattage - something like this 
2. Google is your friend.
3. Check your electricity bill.

"1. BTC-е is at its peak of financial strength with the record levels of clients and capital adequacy. The company plans to start publishing financial statements, verified by an external audit, on a regular basis."
Certainly sounds positive and the kind of steps that need to be taken to increase customer confidence. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:24:04
Sorry how is btc-e a scam?
@_date: 2014-02-12 09:48:20
Ah nice one - thought we were in for an even more interesting day!
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:25:30
Given Gox's contempt for their customers - I imagine they'd have no worries about pursuing their employees for breaking said NDAs'.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:27:46
I've had nothing but a great experience with btc-e and I'm always surprised that despite volume they seem to be less well known.
Out of the big exchanges btc-e's latest news release (linked above) is the  clearest and most strongly worded outline of the situation I've seen.  
@_date: 2014-02-25 16:20:26
Would you trust that many BTC to one wallet? An exchange is never going to cold store all BTC in one wallet. But I certainly agree that some proof of capital holdings would go a long way.
@_date: 2014-02-12 13:51:38
Same problem here.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:27:44
Does this help - 
First I'd heard of it today - nearly wet myself with laughter.
@_date: 2014-02-26 23:27:19
I stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-02-26 18:28:24
if thats what he meant - fair shout. However - having been a long serving customer I'm not sure where this came from - "they are fucking over customers"?
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:32:39
Yeah blockchain.info still showing an incorrect balance for my wallet address...
Correct balance displayed when accessing via another blockchain explorer.
@_date: 2014-03-20 13:50:02
Doesn't really help you out - but mine came back up yesterday and it working fine now.
@_date: 2014-04-12 19:02:51
 Always worth making sure you replace all the filler in your template :-) 
@_date: 2014-04-01 13:52:55
This pretty much sums up what's happened  I'd say its about as far from Gox as you can get.
@_date: 2014-03-18 15:13:17
Cheers for the reply. Sure you guys have it all in hand.
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:50:43
Urgh, ugly lazy embed. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 11:53:59
Ah fair shout - not actually used it myself.
@_date: 2014-04-03 13:43:27
One thing I've come to include in 'value' based apps is a cash out price. It might not be relevant for your work -but I always include a 12 hour average from localbitcoins to give people a figure for their value if they were to sell right there and then. If you in the states though - they have much better support for cashing out via an exchange. IN the UK I flog all my btc via localbitcoin - where the price is often different from an exchange. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:59:55
Sorry about your loss dude - but c'mon - " I continued to bet against mt gox solvency - essentially doubling my initial potential loss". 
Rule Number 1 - never invest more than you can afford to loose. I get there's alot of people out there giving those who've been 'goxed' alot of grief - but to a certain extent you  had it coming. You've stated yourself you've betted on the solvency of a company on which you have absolutely no reliable information to back this up.
The internet was screaming to leave gox - yet you chose to double down?
Forgive me if I don't read too much into your 'theories' - but I wish you all the best and hope by some slim chance you make your money back. 
@_date: 2014-03-24 12:19:54
Thanks to everyone who has ordered so far! Has been great to be taking order in Bitcoin too! 
@_date: 2014-03-12 14:44:45
Very apt. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:28:18
Yup, best place to keep up to date and great discussions. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 12:57:36
To avoid worries in the future - make sure you've got 2FA setup. It will ask you for a code every time you login or make a transaction. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 08:30:38
The old fashioned way - trial and error! Stick a small amount of dosh in the system and have a play around. Best way to learn anything. 
@_date: 2014-03-18 14:52:45
Same here. Checked with 3 other people and same for them.

Credit / debit card transactions typically take 3 days to process. The charge is taken - and then the receiver has 3 days in which to 'claim' this charge. It might seem instant when you use plastic in a shop - it isn't. 
@_date: 2016-05-24 14:54:33
Considering how rarely they seize my funds - I can live with it :) 
I'm sure we'd all love of world where that wasn't the case - but it is. Bitcoin may or may not be a step to changing that.
@_date: 2016-05-24 13:20:32
Yeah - and if that was a fraudulent charge you can have it reversed...
