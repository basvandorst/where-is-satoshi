I guess its possible :P but we'd advise a fleshlight cleaning liquid :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:42:34
:( im sure there is someone in Canadialand who can help you out!
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:52:17
From what ive gathered in the BTC communnity, the majority of people are eager and enthusiatic to spend and put their BTC to good use. So why do you have a problem with us promoting the fact that we accept bitcoin and are further helping the communnity spend their coins on stuff they want? 
And in us accepting bitcoin, we are increaseing public awareness of bitcoin, thus further interest and demand, thus increasing the value. So, you are angry at us for trying to improve the value of something you own?
You seem like someone who has sat with coins for a while and refuses to spend them because you're butthurt the value has fallen and you didnt sell when you had the chance. 
No please, go and take your negativity somewhere else. You're boring and annoying.
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:22:03
Okay, Okay point taken. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:47:45
Well thank god we're here! :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:25:23
We've sold some vibrators too :) but fleshlight orders seem to be pumping through the roof with btc :P
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:56:46
In absolutely no way 'off a cliff'. We did this mainly as a bit of fun. We get bitcoins orders through almost daily.  
So what was your conclusion from all of this? Where were you trying to achieve? 
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:17:59
have faith my friend.
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:29:16
Yes, it's all done via bitpay instantly. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:05:50
Thank you sir.
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:53:12
If you are in the UK, you totally just won a £10 gift voucher for our site :P We are feeling generous :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:51:20
We love you guys too! 
@_date: 2014-07-08 00:06:43
As for the 'off a cliff' point, we don't just deal in bitcoins. We recieve orders on a daily basis, as for bitcoin exclusively, somedays we get multiple orders, some one, some none.
We without any promotion or 'reminding' in the past 3 weeks we have recieved consistant orders with btc mainly pushed from BTC business directories. But there is definitelty still demand. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:36:20
We are a .co.uk business, we specifically only sell and ship within the UK, sorry brother bear :(
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:50:51
Maybe not "Permanently" but definitely for the next couple of weeks :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:28:54
We don't but we would definitely consider opening one up if people are interested.
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:55:59
It's actually something we are currently expanding into, still in the devlopment stages though, but thanks for the heads up!
edit: We now have fleshlights for all you guys who are looking for some more excitement :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:41:32
We do them :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:32:36
ding ding ding we have a winner.
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:06:01
We will 100% look into it! That look fricken cool!
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:41:21
thank the god of dildos thats not a website. only the other hand if anyone wants to borrow a slightly used rubber fist, les us know :P
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:34:26
Fleshlights! You BTC'ers love them!
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:45:20
Nothing has come through as of yet!
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:50:39
you guys would slip right in, no problem :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:39:12
We wouldn't have it any other way :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:50:12
We'll leave the offer on for a little longer! And we do have some products that can prolongong your excitment. 
 
Hope this helps :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 09:50:29
Unfortunatley at the moment we just slide through the UK :( but one day we will expand :)
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:13:49
We're not really up for sharing the exact number but it has been great! And we are posting this now becasue 1; we'd like to help convince any other stores that accepting cryptos is a great step forward and 2; because we are one of few sex stores that accept bitcoin and i think you guys need to know about us.
@_date: 2014-05-23 11:17:51
I wish. But i don't think many people need 55 gallons of lube :P
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:25:23
We use BitPay so save us the hastle! 
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:15:16
That's all fixed now! Apologies for the inconvenience! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:28:01
Send 'your friend' our way and we'll make 'your friend' even more happy :)
@_date: 2014-07-07 18:53:53
Definitely fleshlights! They seem to be, by far the most popular with BTC'ers. :)
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:47:22
Will do, thanks :)
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:25:59
Frictionless :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 10:05:34
Skyn are cool but we do have Skins who are pretty cool too :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:30:30
Would you like my address and bank account numbers too?
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:16:29
The GBP settlement is £2k (roughly $3500 USD).  Just their policy i guess. Which seriously needs to be changed if they want to encourage store to work with them. 
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:47:09
We'll hit you up with an upvote :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:34:28
Thank you for supporting us! We love the BTC community and helping couple add that little extra spark to their life :)
Thanks for being awesome.
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:31:00
I dont have the permission to give out such figures unfortunately. And well done Sherlock. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 18:27:19
Hopefully it's a frictionless transaction. ;)
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:33:59
Just lube yourself up and slide out the crotchless part.
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:44:00
We just want to help create a nice buzz for bitcoin :)
@_date: 2014-07-08 08:33:44
Thanks dude. I had a look at his account and his views on gay marriage and woman’s rights made me feel a lot better about my self. Some people just aren't too good at the whole life thing.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:47:08
Nope, stock is available on all items! 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:32:23
living the dream :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:43:22
im sure 99.99% of redditors are okay will dildos :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:52:51
What brand would that be?
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:42:04
We'd be happy to help you out :)
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:27:46
As cool as that was, it all seems a bit random.
@_date: 2014-07-21 16:13:27
Just to let you know, we now sell internationally and are still accepting bitcoin. :)
@_date: 2014-05-23 15:14:44
Just looked into them! We sure can add them! :)
@_date: 2014-07-07 23:11:38
Well im going to throw all that out the window and say we've have a few sales of vibrators with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:22:55
Just incase you were wondering, our products do NOW slide through europe :) 
@_date: 2014-06-04 18:39:09
Reviews are genuinely pretty stellar when it comes to fleshlights! They are surprisingly realistic when it comes to pleasure and stimulation.
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:40:45
Glad we could help :)
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:05:56
We'll definitely have a look into that! Thanks for the suggestion!
@_date: 2014-05-27 10:00:25
Its not about the size of the market, it's the way you penetrate it :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 09:28:15
Thanks brother bear.
@_date: 2014-05-27 08:51:09
He has alread beat you to it and ordered a couple for you! :P
@_date: 2014-07-07 20:11:02
Awesome question. Bitcoin has been great as we've opened ourselves up to the BTC community. I know you guys love seeing more and more places accepting bitcoin and personally i think cryptos are the future as people are becoming far more conscious about personal cyber security. As for bad things, hmm there aren't many negatives other than Bitpay holding rather large amounts of our money before it pays you out which is slightly inconvenient. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 14:35:22
There is absolutely nothing stopping it being used by a man, i'd just suggest picking up some lube at the same time!
