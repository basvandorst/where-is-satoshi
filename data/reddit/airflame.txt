People still not get it 
Market = risk of this shit happen
Cold storage = no risk of this shit to happen
From the day there was problems with Mt gox i have moved all my money on COLDs and i will sell them if there will be better price on markets. I know You can get more money from selling and buying but shit it's more risk You can get goxed like people on gox.
@_date: 2014-01-24 11:47:51
Well i don't think so because when You buy 1 bitcoin for price like 900$ and You will want to buy something after a month for price 820$. You will have 1 bitcoin buy he is worth 700$.
@_date: 2014-02-24 09:04:37
No problem.

@_date: 2014-02-11 11:50:15
Yea but it was a news on .coindesk so i don't think they lie about something. Maybe i am wrong.
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:07:42
Well the best punishment for PayPal will be when everyone will stop using it then they will know blocking users having any association with digital coins is not a good idea.

You can always download the png and upload it to some server and change the code. They are not deleting the patterns they are creating them and i think they don't care if someone use the pattern from the server.
@_date: 2014-02-10 11:18:17
You are from MT.GOX ? :P
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:52:13
Hmm yes but You cant stop it like they stopped napster. And sending something virtual is not illegal.
@_date: 2014-02-07 09:58:48
Well there is too many withdrawals thats why they have problems and they closed them because they need to be fixed so don't panic lol You can always take BTC and send it to Your wallet or other market BTC-E, Bitstamp etc after they fix this problem

Well don't know about disturbing. I know they can only spend double sending attack like SearchForTruthNow2 said. If they stop mining nothing will go to them i think but i can be wrong. Don't worry all miners have split and the network is safe.
@_date: 2014-02-10 12:01:39
Hmm i will say that. Mt.Gox is playing us. They are making money on Panic. When people on mt.gox withdraw money they have to wait 2 weeks or so. So mt.gox is making money on those falls they withdraw to people like 50000$ or more the price go down and same making panic. People start to sell BTC for 2 reasons panic second is they selling high and then buying cheep. And then gox comes with the pull of money when the price is low they start buying the BTC. After the price go up they do the same. Sell the BTC and withdraw money to people the price go down and the panic make it go low and when it is low they buy BTC pure profit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:15:16
Roger that
@_date: 2014-11-05 12:56:07
Are any other mining companies registered with SEC? If not, why focus on GAW?
@_date: 2014-02-07 12:04:25
Well i will love To see the video if not this article is fake. Second i think Mtgox will fix the problem and after 10th everything will be ok. Btw don't You think there is a connection of UK Ebay 10th accepting the bitcoin and mtgox problems ?

@_date: 2014-02-24 08:33:12
Yes but even mtgox will hit 100$ or 50$ the price will drop 50$-100$ max on other markets so i don't see here a point of making even a small panic. Mtgox dropped from 307$ to 150$ the market drop from 600$ to 570$ it's only 30$ so mtgox does not affect so mutch the markets.
@_date: 2014-02-07 11:04:28

**access through the abuse of a bug in the bitcoin system**
HAHAHAHAAH they still blaming bitcoin for the loosing bitcoins ffs are they mad ?
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:05:27
Well they say here  BTC have been stolen.
'The exchange says hackers exploited a glitch in the trading system and that Bitcoins may have been withdrawn through illegal access.'
So whats the problem to check the address and get the fuckers ? USA got silk road and the BTC. JAPAN can't get BTC thieves from gox?
If they lost money now i think it's possible to find the BTC where they are send. If they lost money before one year ago+ well we can't do shit.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:45:50
'a decision was taken to close all transactions for the time being in order to *protect* the site and our users'
*Protect* from what ? Pulling the BTC or $ out of this devil shit hole ? People want the money back not the fucking protection of Yours.

This is when mtgox starts goxing people... :/ I will be not surprised the drop of price is caused by ~~mark karpeles~~ selling the coins
@_date: 2014-03-02 19:43:32

You just answered my question, good day Sir.
@_date: 2014-09-24 22:47:53
I think bitcoin will not fall napster was on a server bitcoin is community.
@_date: 2014-03-30 11:27:32
Yes i am not selling too but when the btc will fall they will be worthless ? Right ?
@_date: 2014-02-20 13:46:47
Well in this point of price at mtgox i will consider disconnecting from them because they can make more mess but this time on other markets. And i am not talking about 500$ per bitcoin i am talking about 100$ or less.
@_date: 2014-05-06 13:39:10
Yes but posting the same shit again making people puke is not a discussion its manipulation or worse making panic... Call it as you wish for me its the same shit rolling like a fat man falling from endless stairs. You should send this Reddiquette to people posting this china shit repeating events that have happened weeks ago or even months.  
@_date: 2014-02-09 21:02:53

@_date: 2014-01-24 11:13:41
Well i can take heat but i don't understand why if more people buy bitcoins and use them to buy some stuff or keep them on wallets the price go down ? Btw i have some bitcoins for 950$ and i am doing holdor :)
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:33:09

Hmm thats intresting. But You are not worry about the price You have bought the btc ? Like i have Bought only 10btc at price 800$ and will spend them on the items in stores some day. But if the price go to 400$ i will loose half of it. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 22:06:25
I Can't understand there is no ban no bad news but still price going down. Someone can explain ?
@_date: 2014-04-08 14:01:25

@_date: 2014-04-30 22:10:46
The guy at the beginning is this guy saying bitcoin offline ? :D
@_date: 2014-02-24 08:47:35
Yes You do for now but that will not happen if 40% or more people will use bitcoin. And i think making price go down and up by selling and buying to make *profit* is not good for Bitcoin. People need to tust the exchange when they are buying BTC. Not worry about if they buy 1BTC the price can go down tomorrow and it will be worth 1/5 lower of the money they have put in.
@_date: 2014-01-29 16:51:59
Well watching this and all is going in a good direction they are positive about BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-05 17:48:19
5+ points for protection :)
@_date: 2014-02-07 10:16:30
Well another panic... 
So if they block transfering BTC just wait... Why cash out now ?
@_date: 2014-01-24 14:35:56

I am so sorry for those that lost bitcoins or $ on the mtgox site. I hope this is not the end of end of mtgox and You will be able to get the money or bitcoin from them. I hope someone will buy the mtgox and reactivate them. So all those people that have $ there can get it back somehow. I know some of them have put there all life savings and now they are broke.
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:31:53
Ok thx :) I wonder what will happen if a new market open and there will be no people on it that want to sell the BTC and there will be mass people that want to Buy BTC :)

@_date: 2014-03-13 17:53:15

@_date: 2014-01-24 16:26:16
Same here :/
@_date: 2014-01-24 12:22:22
Yes but price should stay like it was because if someone buying 0,8 BTC and then buy for it something for 0,8 BTC it should not affect the price.
Why ? Because the same amount of money have been bought and spent.
@_date: 2014-01-10 23:54:50
No because he need 51% of network miner power to do that. And at the moment they have less than 40%

Funny that nobody was scammed by GAW yet.
@_date: 2014-03-02 22:54:49
I wonder if Karpelès is a Thief of the coins why he did not disappear/run away? With so many coins he will be able to vanish change face and never seen again but in fact he still in the Japan. I think if he wanted to get all the coins he will be gone before the closing the mtgox and no one will know where to find him right ? I am not saying he is not responsible for loosing so many coins but if he was a thief he will be running away. Well i hope he will proof he is innocent posting the blockchain address where money have been stolen to. And the guy that have took them will get caught. I hope all people that have lost the BTC will be able to recover them and i am deeply sorry for their lost !
@_date: 2014-03-30 10:15:42
I remember when i was buying something online there was a way to pay by paypal so i use it and choose credit card they canceled the payment and charged me 0,31c how fucked up is that ?

I was informed on my bank account bill there was -0,31c for trying to pay for the item :D After that i am not using anything related with ~~paypal~~
