Thanks for that. It answered a lot of my questions about their approach/attitude towards blockchain. However, he says that for blockchain to reach the next level it needs mass adoption. If they put measures in place to stop people using it then they stop mass adoption. I don't think the prohibition argument is really that relevant here because in the case of drink or drugs or whatever, they were things people were already using. They already had mass adoption which is why everybody wanted it even more. But if they put some serious brakes on it now they could stop others from getting on board and investing in the future of the tech (by adding liquidity to the system in the form of BTC/ETH etc) and therefore never allow the system to be strong enough for people to use it to buy houses or use smart contracts or anything else, other than transfer it to another user, and both could face legal issues just for owning it. Anyway, I think it is the most exciting technology I've seen in a long time and I know it has a future. I just know the bankers are working the angles to get control whatevr way they can.

But what if its illegal to trade/accept bitcoin?

Alcohol was already being used by everyone though. A tiny % of people are involved in investing in blockchain technology. So the much larger % will not notice any change and won't care.

I lived in SK tor 2 years and it is a massively technology-driven society. Mostly cashless day to day already. Everything is swiped or bipped for payments. I only ever took cash out if i was splitting dinner that night or playing pool. 
They also love protesting stuff. They are very vocal and the gov tend to pay attention to them. Fair play to them.

Moved to Thailand in 2015, but they're die hard explorer users alright. Drove me nuts.

Is there such a thing as an online store for artists to sell their work using crypto? I’m a photographer and I would sell photos at a discount for crypto.

I'm not worried. I was just watching the depth chart battle on gdax last night and Mickeys motivation speech came to mind. 
It's very interesting to watch the depth chart with the order book and trade history opened. Such small volumes being traded really, and it swings all over the place but its fun to watch. I've only got a small investment, so I don't have the stress some may have.

They're just trying to protect individuals from getting into debt if the short term value falls. 10K credit this month hoping the value rises - it doesn't  - still have to pay the 10K back plus the interest. I'm sure plenty of people are in this boat unfortunately. It's to save people from themselves. 
Don't worry, Bitcoin is here to stay. Adoption may move slowly, but this thing is just a baby. Really, any price you get it at now is going to be good as a long term investment. You don't hear anyone say, "I bought at $2, man I wish I had bought it at $1".

I don't understand the hostility you're getting. Everything you say makes perfect sense to me and I've only been interested in the crypto market the last 2 months. Down a fair bit but no chance I'll sell - its a small investment so I don't have the same pressure which helps. I'm sure it will rebound because I believe in the technology and Bitcoin, as you say, is the flagship. No coincidence that all the alt coins drop when it does and vise versa. I may lose some money on the shitcoins I gambled on if they dissappear over the next while, but the tech is sound and not going anywhere. 
As far as FUD in the media, I don't get what people are talking about. All I see are positive developements of integration and adoption by major players. No idea when to buy more is but once it stabalises I'll put all I can into Bitcoin. Regulation doesn't scare me. It's a natural step and will probably simply involve tighter restrictions on buying and trading as well as targeted taxation or some such shit, but in my opinion money laundering and dodgy dealing will be harder with a public ledger than ever before (and this is the reason goverments quote as the reason to badmouth Bitcoin). I might be talking shit but I simply do not belive Bitcoin is going anywhere and once all the panic selling, or whatever is going on stops, it will recover. 
I invested for the future. For me that's 5+ years on a technology like this. Even longer. Not a week or any amount of time measured in hours. 
Feeling bad for how much shit people are slinging at you. Sound to me like you know your stuff and know how to keep cool while others are losing their heads.

Did you enable the 'Instant Profit' option in the settings tab? It's easily missed. I have mine set to 'Insane', with the extra options for early retirement, luxury villa and classic car collection all clicked.

The value is in the technology. The platform.  Try to understand that first.
With BTC, it's the most tested, most resilient (to date) and most well-known (aka market leader) platform in the crypto space. So that's where a lot of the money flows to at this stage in 2018.
We will probably, initially, have a Facebook and Google of the crypto space. Bitcoin (the technology and platform) is well placed to be one of those major players. But it could also be the MySpace of crypto, so we need to watch our investments in the long term. Ethereum's ethos and seemingly more proactive development goals may help it surpass Bitcoin. Who knows. 
But the money flows in because of the revolutionary platform it's built on. Not because of, whatever you think.

That's not exactly what I meant when i said, "explain like I'm 5".

I had a read of this: 
Technical aspects of mining make my head hurt, but I understand how people would be pissed off about the ASIC Boost issue. That is, providing the information in that article is kosher. 
Thanks for your reply. Seems like some fighting in the trenches going on.

I agree with you there. The whole sub seems to be a bunch of 12 year olds.

I don't understand why people say it's a scam. I know they're fighting pretty dirty by trying to claim the name, but alls fair in love and war. Doesn't make it a scam necessarily.
