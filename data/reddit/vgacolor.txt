I did not know that you could do such small transactions. To be honest, I opened an account today and have not funded it because it seems like a pain. They only accept third tier electronic currencies, and seems like a lot of fees for a wire transfer, and honestly not sure if I want to have my bank account associated with a wire transfer there.

You do not have to take the risk if you don't want to. Regarding MtGox, I do not think cashing out something like 0.50 bitcoins would be very cost effective through their system.
I guess it would be a matter of trusting small transactions of only a few dollars at a time. The deal could be broken up into smaller transactions. Then again if you are worried about loosing a few bucks then you do not have to take the deal.

What exactly did you learn there?  To me the "explanation" is more like an exaggeration of the benefits of Bitcoin without mentioning the significant shortcomings.

This sounds like a good idea. For merchants, you want several categories such as responsiveness of customer support, value proposition {overall premium over market prices in fiat}, timely delivery, quality of good/service. 
The user would rate the business on all of the categories {keep it simple at no more than 5} then you do a weighted average probably giving more weight to actually receiving the good or service.
I would think some coding changing an available template and some web designing should do it. Start by taking a look at existing review websites for inspiration.
Reddit is a good platform, but has shortcomings at showing data like this without using the search feature.

To say that bitcoin is not the problem when there are so many problems with the liquidity {ie: exchanges} is not correct. This is a serious shortcoming of bitcoin as a currency.

But it is not like any other currency. Isn't that the argument of the adapters?

If we are going to be honest, you also see a lot of fan articles that fail to mention the serious liquidity problems with bitcoin as well as the lack of acceptance by the overwhelming majority of the economy.
