Still doesn't make a useless project useful.

Apparently you do not understand the subject either which is worrying since you apparently consider yourself an authority. 
What you describe is a HIGHLY angled possible truth that is as far from impartial as Christian Deckers version. 
The main fault being that you make the assumption that it's either Lightning, or some kind of failure of the blockchain or at least no block size increase at all.
This is of course your own version of a possible future and does not represent reality.
The reality is that it's entirely possible that LN without further block size increase is in fact detrimental to miner income. Or at least presents a situation where miners find themselves at the mercy of whatever feel Lightning operators wish to pay to anchor their payment. 
Failure to understand or present this is baffling to say the least.

None of what Christian describes is guaranteed, and it's ridiculous of the author to pretend to be any form of impartial as a LN developer himself. 
Where is the data that supports these theories that 'LN is great for miners' cause there is equal arguments for it being great as there are for it being a possible disaster for miners. 
It seems like everyone here is forgetting that as much as people scream about 'BU puts us at the mercy of the miners', LN puts the miners at mercy of the LN operators. You can't just expect them to swallow that, as little as you want to be at the mercy of miners.
