Makes me think this list is BS.

I did not know what you meant.
But I still think most would disagree that it is ethical for Alice to pay Bob to kill Carol, for both Bob and Alice.

Where'd this intentional misspelling of hold come from?  I keep seeing it.
Edit:  [oh](

I find it hard to believe he would never post after 11PM.  These times point more toward eastern US.

The total received is over nearly 2 years of large in and out transactions.  It's not like somebody is suddenly trying to launder 780k BTC all at once.

There are many theories on ethics.  I know the kind of ethics you seem to believe in (though I forgot the name of it), regardless I wholeheartedly disagree with that kind.  If talking results in harm coming to another, then I would say that is indeed unethical.

Interesting when you put it that way.  I'm going to read up on that. 
Personally my ethics aren't concrete, and I wouldn't know what classification they'd be closest to.

Is there some math done on this somewhere, that I can read?

It's definitely illegal to hire an assassin.

Compared the 200 Monero blocks to the last 20 Bitcoin blocks and it looks to be about 6x bigger per transaction (600 bytes vs 3600 bytes).  If they are able to create a wallet like electrum that doesn't need to download the whole block chain, this should work still.
I couldn't find out block size info for DRK, though.  The block explorers don't seem to list block size.  Edit: Although now that I think about it I'm not sure darksends would show up there... and they'd probably show up as multiple transactions so I'm not sure how I would calculate that.

It's mostly just laggy.  I lost ~700 QRK that I tried to sell and it never showed up.  I opened a support ticket but they performed a site-wide audit before getting to my ticket and the audit fixed the problem.  It's still scary to see it go missing in the first place so I keep trading to a minimum.

Ah, true.

You can calculate for yourself here:
Be sure to account for how long it will take for you to get it up and operational and how much the difficulty will rise by then.

Of course if the price skyrockets 1000% again that might be a different story.

Also got one, gmail sent it directly to spam.
