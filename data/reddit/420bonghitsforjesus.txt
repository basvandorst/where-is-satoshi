Hahaha, I was thinking the exact same thing. OP’s post is paradoxical 
@_date: 2018-01-12 21:39:40
There aren’t any, unless the exchange has no personal information linked to it whatsoever than it’s never going to be decentralized. That’s why OP is full of shit, moving from one exchange to another that requires the same amount of information does nothing to help the “decentralized goal”

1. Decentralized Network
2. Trading crypto on an Exchange
Choose one 
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:53:32
Until an exchange requires no information other than an email crypto is essentially centralized 
@_date: 2017-12-20 16:27:07
Wasn’t the whole point of crypto to not have government involvement? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:13:56
So....what’s the issue? The IRS hasn’t targeted anybody, it’s just making sure everybody is paying their fair share of taxes. You have nothing to worry about if you’ve been following the rules.

Damn you’re telling me I can be Scrooge McDuck with Venezuelan currency on the cheap? Looks like a business opportunity here.

This is good for Bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:09:10
The US clearinghouse is also intentionally slow to reduce the likelihood of fraud.

Incoming IRS audit, remember Al Capone got sent to jail for Tax Evasion, if there’s one thing the government is good at it’s collecting taxes, don’t try to avoid paying them, you’ll regret it if you ever get audited. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 00:13:44
Soooo, people here champion bitcoin as a unregulated and decentralized currency without the need for government intervention. But what do you know a few people acquired a large amount of bitcoin and can now manipulate the market and now people are crying for the government to do something about insider trading....
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:49:24
If you deliberately change the amounts to get by reporting requirements that is illegal
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:49:00
Or you can be the guy who held to 0 
@_date: 2018-08-23 15:56:18
I thought one of the main selling points of bitcoin and cryptocurrency in general is that it wouldn’t be subject to government regulation. Ironic. 
@_date: 2019-08-06 03:47:36
What, that there’s reason behind one of the price movements?
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:01:09
Yep, I would, even though the market has it’s ups and downs the overall trend is upwards. If you’re long which the majority of Millennials are, than the stock market is the way to go. And where is this “proven to be manipulated” evidence? 
@_date: 2019-01-04 16:17:06
How are these two related in any way? Stupid post. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:29:40
Lmao, assuming the stock market and the crypto market are correlated. Only the big boys make money during a crash and they aren’t buying bitcoin. This post is full of speculative bullshit as per usual
@_date: 2019-01-29 15:58:10
The real reason was greed 
@_date: 2018-02-01 19:09:54
I still fail to see how you can blame coinbase for a change in your credit card company’s policies? It’s not like the companies tell them about any changes in their policies. The way transactions code are handled by the CC company not coinbase. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:43:51
I highly doubt anywhere will let you do it anymore. It was surprising that Coinbase was allowed to go so long before they closed the loophole. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 21:46:38
But my point is that coinbase doesn’t know when the policies of the card companies change so how would they have informed you? The only reason why coinbase decided to send out emails was probably because they got complaints that they were being coded as Cash Advances and they called up the companies to see what was different. Furthermore it was only recently that a lot of major CCs started to charge as cash advances so they informed as soon as that came out. If you really have a problem with it you should contact the CC company and complain they’re the ones that tacked on the additional fees and they should have informed you that they were going to change how coinbase purchases were coded. 
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:39:29
How is it their fault? It’s your fault for not checking what the terms of your credit care are before you purchase. They have no control over what transactions code as, the bank does. 
@_date: 2018-03-31 15:14:45
Yeah, and they’re for various different things. Luckily there were regulations to catch them unlike bitcoin where it was shown that a few wallets from Mt. Gox were driving the price of btc down. 
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:53:54
Because USD is a common means of exchange that is understood by most people. They understand what it generally will buy unlike a bitcoin which can vary thousands of dollars in months.
@_date: 2019-09-04 06:43:08
And yet exchanges need permission to trade, price is influenced by whether countries “ban or allow it”, and it’s considered taxable income. 
Great tech
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:34:08
The correct term for that is “regressive tax” 
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:40:23
Haha, that will never happen, the government is too addicted to our money now 
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:35:31
Avoiding taxes isn’t illegal. They’re trying to help track down tax EVADERS. The difference is very clear
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:38:34
How you gonna make it anonymous. The literal point behind bitcoin is a public ledger 
@_date: 2018-04-12 16:06:19
This will age very well tomorrow 
@_date: 2018-04-19 21:59:43
No it’s not. Tax avoidance is using the tax code to pay less taxes. Tax evasion is illegally not paying taxes. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:41:19
Tax avoidance is legal, tax evasion is not. Please use correct terminology 
@_date: 2018-12-24 00:42:54
They can shut down exchanges which is all they need.
