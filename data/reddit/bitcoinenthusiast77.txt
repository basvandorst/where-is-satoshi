You can do this trade at  You bet on Mt. Gox vs BitStamp price ratio of BTC, without taking on the risk of Gox defaulting.
The amount the contract (Gox to Bitstamp ratio &gt;70% in a week) pays out to the winner is standardized. (0.01BTC, 0.1,0.5, 1BTC). Users have already listed bets at prices(odds) they are willing to take for a given contract payout, you can take the counterparty position or if you are looking for a different price, list your own contract at that price. Your new contract will be listed with others and available to the market. You can do this within a few minutes.
You trade the position securely (no exchange or counterparty risk) through a multisig locked contract. It's basically a binary option.

Payouts are capped at 1 BTC max but its the limit we have imposed for now. Hope that helps solve part of what you were looking for. I am curious, what would you like the max contract size to be?
