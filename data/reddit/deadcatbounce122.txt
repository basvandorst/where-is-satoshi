Never catch a falling knife.
Bitcoin will destroy you. 
How does it feel that you lost 10% within 10 hours? 
Dump it, the sooner the better.

Don’t Fight A Bull Trap
A bull trap occurs when you get a bullish signal on a stock only to watch that stock fall further and further down. When a situation like this happens it is important to remember not to fight it. Don’t put more money into a losing position trying to force it to go back up, (unless you have several billions of dollars of play money of course.)
So, what do you do when you’re caught in the middle of a trap? The most important thing to do is to cut your losses short. The smaller your losses are when you are wrong the less they will affect your account.
