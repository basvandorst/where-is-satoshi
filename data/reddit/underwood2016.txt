I sent in two support tickets last week. The first one they responded to 4 days later saying "sorry for the late response, if you haven't resolved this yet please reply to this email." 2 days later still nothing.

Bitcoin isn't worth dying for. Give it all up. Any sort of armed robbery is one that will get the feds involved anyways and users will be much more forgiving of it.

This is important. Salaries are an expense, so they could still be giving themselves nice bonuses without making a "profit."

Sorry but you won’t catch up to the thousands of man hours already put in by the ethereum devs. For those of you unaware, there are thousands of ICOs and altcoins promising instant, cheap transactions and a decentralized app platform that will take down ethereum. In this context, bitcoin is just another overpriced altcoin valued on the promise of a future deliverable.

Why are we using lightning labs’ experimental/beta software to solve a years’ old problem and why is lightning labs the authority on how to solve this problem? Not shilling the other B coin here. Lots of alts have various ways to handle scale, I’m just worried about this “co founder” gaslighting us. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:27:15
Block size can’t be increased infinitely therefore you should never ever increase it at all, not even once if it solves the problem in the short term. Let’s use beta software instead.

Who is this lightning corporation and why are they in charge of bitcoin development? 
@_date: 2018-01-11 00:34:15
It’s not 2028 it’s 2018, why not use the proven solution that works NOW while you keep developing the beta software that won’t be ready for a while? 
“It won’t work forever therefore I shouldn’t use it ever, not even once to solve the immediate problem” &lt;- great logic

So bitcoin has put off using the KNOWN *temporary* solution for years(Blocksize++) in favor of endlessly testing experimental software to implement at some unknown point in the future? Serious question. 
Bitcoin had 8 years to prepare for the mainstream, you finally get to the mainstream, and completely drop the ball. It could take years to re-spark interest. 
I've worked in different startup environments and one thing I know for certain is that engineers are not some enlightened warrior-monk scribes who know the only way forward. Engineers just as often like to toy with ideas and impress themselves and will 'play' endlessly until they're under pressure to meet a deliverable. I'm sure without the current congestion issue there would be no fire under the core engineers' asses. Dropped. The. Ball. The damage from bch is well deserved.

Bitcoin is a microcosm of why Austrians and libertarians need to shut the fuck up. Seriously every scam, heist, and crash that led to the protections we have for the USD today have been played out in bitcoinworld. Bitcoin will either die out or get regulated to the point that it's no more anonymous and uninsured than fiat. Look at the OPs desperate cry out. That is the voice of someone losing faith. How many scams and thefts is it going to take?

Force: "If you don't follow the law, police will come and arrest you." 
 
Boycott: "I choose not purchase this product because I disagree with the company's values." 
Laws are force. Business relationships that aren't contracts are not. I offer you something, you pay for it. Done deal. I say I hate black people, you stop buying from me. Simple shit. 
People who are giving money to a company out of their own volition stop doing so out of their own volition. The company has no right to the money. You're not stealing from the company or denying them something they're entitled to. You are not threatening to put a company in jail or hurt its owners if they don't comply with your demands in a boycott.

This is why governments don't need to ban bitcoin. Bitcoin does a great job at beating itself up. Neobee, Mt Gox... and I'm just sitting here with my popcorn waiting for coinbase to eat shit.

And that's why libertarianism will always be a hopeless fringe belief. You refuse to learn from professional consent manufacturers. Trying to play politics and win the hearts of Americans without sophistry is like bringing a knife to a gun fight. Hate Luntz all you want, but he's brilliant at what he does. By tweaking a single word in a speech among multiple focus groups, he can pinpoint exactly what phrasing will win the most emotional appeal. 
 
All political idealists(libertarians, anarchists, socialists, race nationalists, conspiracy theorists, etc) are all "waaah wake up sheeple waaah why won't society listen to us" because they suck at marketing. It simply doesn't make sense as a species for every single citizen to become an informed scholar. Most people are too busy trying to sort out their own chaotic lives to take in more than a passing interest into what economic policy is worth a damn. Buzzwords will ALWAYS be king.

Meh, manic entrepreneurs usually make unrealistic predictions about where their start-ups/investments are going. I remember that comment but I didn't see it as malicious.

Rational discourse is for people who've had all their basic human needs met and have an abundance of leisure time. Think about all the time in the day that you spend maintaining your own survival and meeting your own needs: brushing your teeth, eating, driving, working, building and maintaining relationships, etc. Most people are walking balls of stress whose minds are preoccupied with he-said she-said and what their next move is at work and how the bills are going to get paid. If you're privileged, you might have a couple hours of rational self-awareness in a day if you make it your goal to be a thinker. For most, it's a few minutes of making up your mind on a political matter based on what those around your are saying. An interesting narrative is always more compelling to someone than political algebra.

This looks like an AWESOME way to manufacture spend for a credit card (to get airline award miles). Win win for everyone involved. If I get a new credit card with a 40,000 mile offer, all I have to do is process $3000 worth of spend through this site and now I've got a free flight.

Leave it to libertarians to start non aggressive, non-coercive, voluntary fun money and get scammed, robbed and conned week after week to create the greatest modern example of why need governments, banks, and fractional reserve that no economist could have made up on his own. This is what you get for trusting your fellow man.

Article misses the point with PayPal. The best mobile payments system in the world right now is in China(in terms of implementation and usage, not technology). It blows PayPal out of the water and is a truly leave your wallet at home system, but it’s China only. What we want to see is global fast, cheap payments with money crossing borders freely. It’s like if you’re an American and you go on a trip to Ecuador, then Cambodia. It’s a completely USD trip on 3 continents with no currency conversions to worry about. Neither coin is even close to there yet...

Wechat Pay and Alipay are used interchangeably by everyone from street food carts to landlords to fast food and Michelin star restaurants. You can split a bill with friends or pay for your electric bill or buy plane/train tickets all without ever pulling your credit card or dirty cash out. Nothing magical about the tech it’s just QR codes not even NFC.
