Wait, Bitcoin is a brand? A "type of product manufactured by a particular company under a particular name..."? Bitcoin is many things: a brand, it is not.

We literally have arguments about this at work. We have a faction that says that since the dollar, franc, or pound are all lower-case, so too should bitcoin (since it is owned by nobody, I assume). We have another faction that takes the Euro line and wants us to use Bitcoin for anything that isn't related directly to an individual unit. I prefer Bitcoin for the protocol personally, but I can see merit to both arguments.

That's a good write-up - but the fact is that a brand is owned. By a person, by a company, by an organization. A brand, in fact, evolved (as the article points out) from the assertion of ownership, originally from burning marks onto livestock. As a Creative Director for 25 years myself, I have no issue with the concept of a brand as an unspoken mindshare between a thing and a person - but I can't reconcile that with the notion that the shared experience therefore deserves a capital B! (Again, my preference is for that usage, but I think a valid case can be made that bitcoin can be either bitcoin or Bitcoin, and none of us are any the poorer...)

LOL, yeah, you got me. Nice response. Words should be chosen more carefully. I'll rephrase: "Many signs point to trillion dollar crypto market..." and I'll eat my **** on national TV etc etc.

Giving crypto assets to charity seems a great idea, I agree. I wonder if you can deduct them when you do your crypto taxes...

Sounds like a pretty good deal for a long-term holder in particular!
