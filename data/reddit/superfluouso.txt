I continue to fail to see how or why people have such a visceral reaction to ripple.  Personally, I don't see it as a competitor to bitcoin or other crypto currency but something good for the entire space.  Isn't the issue we're seeing with Mt. Gox the type of thing the ripple network would serve to prevent?  
Many people seem to forget this is a very nascent space and I feel we all need to be open to any ideas that will move a decentralized monetary system forward - whether ripple or some other entity/protocol.

Wish other states would follow New Mexico's lead.  For anyone wanting to do this in Montana - they also are very lax with this

yeah..I'm one of those late responders..anyways, none of those fees include the expense of getting money into the exchange before you can trade.
@_date: 2013-08-17 20:58:31
So far it sounds like they've been great bitcoin ambassadors for both the everyday user and merchant.  Have not seen hate but did see confusion regarding their kickstarter funding from people that did not realize the funds are meant only for movie production costs, not their living expenses

A great way I've found to do this is to use coinbase's scheduled buy option.  Takes the emotion out of things and I don't have to hover over the ticker 24/7.

Good luck overtaking 5 petahashes

For anyone that cares - I was sad to hear about this development but went ahead and went through the process.  Was extremely fast/easy and took all of 4 minutes and now I'm back to being able to do instant purchases.
@_date: 2013-07-15 09:01:40
Somewhat altruistic/idealistic, but you could always look at mining on your own as doing your part to secure the network in some small way.

If your in the US and not looking to actively trade, I haven't found anywhere that is easier and cheaper than coinbase.

Put the in a paper wallet with instructions in a security deposit box tied to a bank trust account.  You die, the executor of your estate hands over the contents of the box to your benefactors who then give the fed and their bloody estate tax the finger.
@_date: 2013-09-11 04:14:47
How do they manage it?  What wallets are they using?
@_date: 2013-07-21 03:38:03
Thinking the lag everyone is referring to may be tied to the fact that the majority of their btc is offline.  Maybe a trade off for the security?

Do you have proof they buy from Gox? - I've been wondering where they get BTC from and I'm guessing its not Gox as their prices have been lower than Gox since last week when Gox suspended U.S. dollar withdrawals.

This is one of the intriguing aspects of bitcoin.  Estate tax my ass..

I'd say anything that builds transactions inside the bitcoin blockchain is pretty relevant to bitcoin.

There are a lot of great resources on the right side of this sub reddit.  As was already mentioned, localbitcoins might work best for you.

It generally takes 6 or 7 days.  But you lock in your purchase or sale price immediately.  As for transferring, once available, you can immediately transfer them to any wallet you prefer.

Point is, we don't make the great leaps without the small steps.  I'll be surprised if all of the various flavors of alt coins don't lead to some relevant advance in the world of cryptocurrency. Odds are, you'll have a better chance of having a brilliant idea if you simply have a lot of ideas, good or absolute shit, ala Thomas Edison. Just wait till the genesis block for krillcoin is released.

No problems here with Authy - why not just use that?
@_date: 2013-11-04 22:37:41
Whether it be mastercoin or something that copies it in the future, it s a development in the bitcoin network.  I believe further development and exploration in cryptocurrency is a good thing.  If some fails and others succeed, it is all beneficial to the advancement and wider adoption of digital currency and payment networks.  To try your hardest to down vote actual developments in the bitcoin network only discredits yourself and is a disservice to the entire r/bitcoin community.  
@_date: 2013-09-10 09:10:37
I realize there are numerous options currently available for traditional sources of capital gains, just nothing btc specific.  I guess what I mean is it would be nice if the exchanges/services could provide statements to us the same way you normally do with a brokerage account.  
I recall hearing/reading that the IRS will possibly be posting general guidance on digital currencies on their website sometime in November..will be curious to see how detailed they get.
@_date: 2013-08-07 19:00:27
Ok- yep after 2 days, all 3 transactions hit at once.  Thanks for everyone's input!

Completely incorrect--you can view their price at any time without placing an order.

I think I just read an article that stated approximately 1 million people hold btc - not sure what that was based on.  If just wallets that's obviously not going to be accurate as many have several wallets..
@_date: 2013-06-21 22:34:05
Does anyone know where Coinbase actually gets their BTC - because they're not actually an exchange correct?  Before the Mt Gox ordeal, I'd notice there price would be slightly higher than Gox.  Now that Gox is not releasing dollars, they're slightly higher than bitstamp/btc-e.  In addition to the transaction fee, I'm wondering if they profit off the additional difference in BTC price from the other exchanges..

For others that may be as clueless as me:
From Wikipedia:
The Streisand effect is the phenomenon whereby an attempt to hide, remove, or censor a piece of information has the unintended consequence of publicizing the information more widely, usually facilitated by the Internet.
It is named after American entertainer Barbra Streisand, whose attempt in 2003 to suppress photographs of her residence in Malibu, California, inadvertently generated further publicity. Similar attempts have been made, for example, in cease-and-desist letters, to suppress numbers, files and websites. Instead of being suppressed, the information receives extensive publicity and media extensions such as videos and spoof songs, often being widely mirrored across the Internet or distributed on file-sharing networks.[1][2]

My confidence has nothing to do with price, only with functionality of the blockchain.  The price can go to a buck and as long as westill have this hashing power I'm still happy.  We've never had such a powerful tool like this before.

I suspect KNC is nearing the end of what they can provide in October before they discount their products for sale in November.  I'd wait to get in on Cointerra's offering (details at end of month) or possibly KNC's second gen stuff that they've indicated they plan to have available around March.  
@_date: 2013-07-07 17:28:20
Agree. -  I suspect there are a ton of weak hands in btc just based on the assumption that most are younger with smallish net worths.  The market needs much more liquidity.
@_date: 2013-06-23 06:54:10
The guy is in the UK - coinbase will only work for accounts in the U.S...for now.  But I agree coinbase is the easiest option for those that can use it.

If you're simply looking to acquire btc, I think its hard to beat coinbase.  However, if you plan to actively trade, I'd go the bitstamp route...

They are actually pretty nice and secure if handled properly.  Make sure to store in a safe location, with a copy somewhere else if you wish.  Then set up a watch only wallet for the address at blockchain.info to monitor the amount.  Continue to add more btc to it as desired for savings..
@_date: 2013-07-13 09:22:41
I agree with that sentiment, but not when it comes to something like Primecoin whose mining activity can yield other benefits beyond currency.
