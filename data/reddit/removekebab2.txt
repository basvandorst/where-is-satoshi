What about privacy? 
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:45:45
So in short Lightning is like an exchange.. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 19:47:02
LIGHTING or bust. It's that simple. 
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:57:04
Here's what the real thing looks like:
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:55:17
Is there a known date for this? 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:40:55
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:24:43
THIS IS JUST THE POWER SUPPLY???
Wow. They should have typed that in the title.
@_date: 2017-12-12 17:32:46
Yes, it is until next month. But I guess its popular so its worth buying, right?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:25:37
Dont know what.to choose
@_date: 2017-12-26 20:55:07
If hardware wallets are simplified there will be a greater adoption among typical consumers. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:36:14
Can't I somehow accelerate that process? 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:52:54
I personally wonder what if most countries illegalise btc or any other currency? Who will use it then?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:27:03
Ok so I don't have the ability to ask for a refund via some command? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:22:59
That's a fking disaster. So if I wait for 2 weeks I will get a refund? 
Or do I have to do something to get them back? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:57:16
Very nice idea!
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:57:26
I expect some innovations with hardware wallets so then people will adopt it in great numbers but not before that.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:05:43
Those that cost 100$ and come in January seem OK I guess..?
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:39:08
Core.or.large mempool, what.is.what???
@_date: 2017-12-28 16:11:08
Should have googled. Thanks! 
@_date: 2017-12-25 19:58:44
I've been using Segwit address since September lol I thought almost everyone uses it by now. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:31:39
Can't say no to a Christmas discount! 
@_date: 2017-12-13 21:22:37
Give a few to Andreas Antonopulos he deserves SO MUCH MORE for promoting BTC around the world, he commited all his time to it.
Edit: Oh, I almost forgot to mention DRACO project!  Its huge the man needa about 2 million dollars to experiement with universal antiviral therapy for ALL viruses! Imagine the implications if it works! 
I **really** hope you are still reading the thread, OP.
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:49:53
Its a guy 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:23:49
I wonder what will happen when 10 plus million people start using it. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 16:27:32
In BLR kt is **illegall** to be unemployed. So this shouldn't be taken so seriously. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:13:48
Thats cool, but make It random!
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:35:31
I didn't understand most of your comment. I sent it using ledger nano s. Does it support non-rbf transactions? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:13
I used a Segwit address. I wanted to deposit to an exchange from Italy. It would probably be faster and cheaper if I put those cca 150$ in an envelope anf mailed it there so they can manually add BTCs to my account... 
@_date: 2017-12-31 17:38:09
Exactly. Lightning will be underwhelming. But it will be good enough. I hope, at least. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:05:01
Ok thanks for your time! 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:40:06
People are fucking stupid, thats why I dont think BTC will ever see mainstream adoption...
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:37:17
It does temporarily.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:46:34
I assume that simply because hardly any women cared about BTC 5 or more years ago. 
Even today, I don't think more than 5% of users are women. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:26:07
How do I calculate how long will it take? Does anyone know?
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:31:36
Oh. Got it. 
@_date: 2018-06-30 15:12:30
To be faster and to become usable by many at the same time. 
@_date: 2018-06-24 15:23:07
It means they are doing dodgy stuff... 
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:31:14
Eli5? 
@_date: 2018-06-07 12:46:22
Don't know what NVDA is... 
@_date: 2018-06-27 17:38:47
Wrong currency
@_date: 2018-02-11 15:27:59
Did you pay to open the channel? And if yes how much? 
@_date: 2018-07-19 08:12:56
A year now! 
@_date: 2018-07-22 17:03:53
LMAO. 
@_date: 2018-07-29 08:54:35
Shocking
