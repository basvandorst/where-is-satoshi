It's a public ledger. So you are not anonymous at all.

No gov control.

Sounds like he was trading BTC to fiat and fiat to BTC....

None of them.

Take a photo of you next to a miner.... what proof can there be that you mined it ? What if you lost the private key of the original address after you sent it to the exchange ? I did so, this can happen.
Those coins came from the exchange, so you can't have any proof of anything.

Oh sorry about that.

I always verify my accounts before I use the services to avoid situations like this.

If they believe that you stole this money its going to be difficult to unfreeze the account. If they stopped communications 2 months ago this may mean that they confiscated your bitcoin and were not impressed by your KYC.

The average citizen has more stuff in 2018 that in 1918... the value number on the dollar bill means nothing. Also we have much more money than in 1918.

Any proof ?

Wtf are you talking about...

Considering everyone is hungry and in some cities the mafia has taken over... very dangerous.

Because when it's going up you make bitcoins not shit dollars.

They just saved you money, to buy after almost 200% increase in such a short time is stupid.
@_date: 2019-05-14 21:00:35
From 3140 usd to 8200, we are closer to 200%. I would wait for a retracement to 4 or 5K to buy.

Bitcoin is here to stay even if Satoshi was hitler.
