They take it as an "insult" because the people propagating the idea of it being a bubble think it's going to be a terminal bubble that drops down to 0 value.

...accurate so far.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:24:06
If it goes up just 200 bucks.. they make 200K... and yes, it's going up at least 200 bucks for sure. I'd bet money on that.
@_date: 2019-07-10 03:23:18
He did that... to fuck with yOU.
@_date: 2019-07-04 15:54:52

...in *this* context it sounds silly, but the guy is right from an objective perspective.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:46:53
Exactly..and 200K to someone who even have millions is a lot to just let slip through their fingers. That's a nice exotic sports car.

The issue is that people might "miscommunicate" how all of this is *suppose* to work. Most people on here aren't tax professionals so when they use their Turbo Tax Deluxe edition next year they may not know that they are in a situation where they should show there gains and if they do they may not know where they show this info in there tax forms. We are just recently finding out that we show it at all... yeah, it's a simple thing.. until it's not a simple thing.

Yes... If they did, more people would invest.

I didn't mean it like that.. honestly I didn't plan on spending that much... date was ordering $20 double shots... and $26 steak dinner that she didn't even eat. It adds up fast.. but what I am saying is that even if he is impoverished it's not a life changing amount. Yes, it can pay your light bill for one month, but sitting here and crying about a $100 bill when your reality is that you are poor... it's not productive. Instead of spending hours hounding these guys after *you* made the mistake you should be coming up with a plan. If the $100 was of such great value.. why not SECURE IT. I remember investing in small business stuff when I was about 21 using a credit card and spending $400.. didn't make any money. Did I cry to the credit card company? No, I paid the bill till it was paid off. Making money is war and you must approach it as a General.

Why throw 10% away now when he could invest it and make more out of it and then REALLY change his love ones lives.

The problem with your argument is that it doesn't matter if they *know* which way the tide will turn or not. "Insider Trading" is based on the fact that they have all of this "insider" information before anyone else and they are given the ability to be more prepared than anyone else. No inside trader "knows" for sure what is going to happen, but they do usually have enough information to make an educated guess.

I bank with them, but ONLY so that I can use their ATM anywhere in the country. I didn't even get my mortgage through them when I purchased a home... I just don't trust them like that. So I understand. In fact, I don't even use my BofA card anymore. I just charge EVERYTHING and pay the bill every two weeks. I can rack up points and not worry about dealing with them for anything except paying my credit card AND I can keep the convenience of having a debit card just in case I need to get cash from the ATM.

I haven't been around here very long.. and I don't know much about bitcoin, but from what research I have done it is a somewhat different type of "dip". From looking at the chart over a year this dip looks similar from a distance, but when you zoom in on the period in which the last three dips occurred including this latest one you'll see it dipped much faster relatively speaking... as though it was manipulated.

Are you not understanding what I am explaining to you? If you purchase from COINBASE.COM it will LOCK IN YOUR PRICE. If you don't, and choose to use Gdax you will save on the fees at Gdax, BUT by the time you get the bitcoin the price will have possibly GONE UP(possible 100's of dollars). 
Which would you rather do moving forward?

I think there *might* be a "2nd" coin, but it'll be like the difference between Western Union and Moneygram... no one uses Moneygram.

Ummm delicious BCH scaps.   
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:30:13
BUT ...you don't get your coin instantly do you.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:23:30
Cause they were/are trying to kill BITCOIN.
@_date: 2017-11-13 13:35:36
What do *you* use? Yes, I have taken a look.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:38:09

...you know what I'm saying... their Netflix bill then.
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:30:53
If you believe it will rise in value, why not purchase now? yeah, it would be good to catch a "dip", but how do you that it will dip? It might not go below 6K for a long time, if ever. Just make sure you don't purchase more than you are willing to lose.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:08:11
Sometimes people equate "Talking about the money you're making." as arrogance.
@_date: 2017-11-12 02:08:49
"...you pay higher fees than just using an exchange."
...would this make much of a difference with just one coin I would purchase and hold?
@_date: 2019-02-22 23:21:34
App? How do you mean?

No, he's talking about the people who own at least 1 whole Bitcoin, which is 1%.
@_date: 2017-11-13 20:07:02

I think it's more of a personal "Investment Bank" than a "Wallet". 
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:58:09
I'm not telling you to do this, but coinbase.com takes credit cards if  remember right. If you got brass balls it might be an option.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:20:27
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:56:26
Right... that's why this doesn't scare me. People are talking about a "bubble"... as many have said, even US dollars could be considered a "bubble" then.
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:38:01
Hell yeah.

Yep.. I'm addicted to making money myself. ..I'm not very materialistic. My biggest frivolous purchases are video games, food, wine and a vacation every now and then... I just like the idea of running the "score" up in a bank account. That and I know that money does hold a certain level of power in this world. you can make things happen when you have enough.

I'm not spending it... just an investment.

I keep telling you guys this "fee avoidance" shit is gonna catch up with you. The guys who use "Robinhood" as a brokerage are messing up like this too... they find themselves not being able to Buy or Sell at a split seconds notice and it kills them in the end. I'll pay extra just to safeguard myself.

I wasn't speaking of the stock market as a "whole".... I was speaking of the specific stocks I like to mess around with versus this bitcoin. I have messed with stocks that you jump into  at 9:30AM when the market opens and you better be out of by 11AM before tha dip comes... you have to literlly babysit these stocks they are so fast moving. Yeah, day trading. That is voltility. I think I know a little about making money... just a little.

You would be a fool to think it's not. Yes, when it works, it *works*. But when it doesn't, it can get messy.

What was that?
@_date: 2017-11-15 05:09:42
That's not cherry picking. The doubling of price which occurred over 24 hours was the "indicating" marker for when BTH began to be manipulated... once the value dropped back down that was the marker for when we all realized the manipulation was over with and it wasn't gonna work. It's all evident... it's not cherry picking if these were prominent indicators of some sort of artificial manipulation of the currency. This is not some emotional rant... it is an objective assessment.

@_date: 2017-11-25 22:01:29
Why don't you guys purchase through coinbase? The fees are negligible when you account the money you lose waiting days for them to deposit your coin.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:19:28
...as in overstock.com?
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:12:51
Betting 7% in hopes of one daying making $25-100K per coin... well, you do  the math.
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:01:32
In that case...why not just pay USD, and stop fumbling around with your BTC investment. That's like using a stock brokerage account like a checking/debit... which I think is possible... that's stupid(in my Dave Ramsey voice)

I took a risk and put 20-30K into my first investment property, my parents told me not to,  I did it anyway. It took me 3 years to finish renovating the house  (while I lived i. It). I could tell my friends thougt it was a stupid idea... guess what, I sold the house in 2 days... and made a handsome profit. I won't go into the numbers on here, but it was enough to satisfy me after all of my heartache and pain. ...so investing in this isn't that scary to me. I know my experience is different from most of you guys but I'm just saying at some point you have to "jump off the porch".

@_date: 2017-11-17 12:05:45
I got ya.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:58:35
No, low high sell...
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:54:09
Lol, you guys hear this guy?!?!?... We are are on the advent of a new form of currency... and he is standing on the sidelines. Buahaha.. I'm about to HODL bish!
@_date: 2017-11-17 11:54:50
...and even it is leaving him!
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:10:39
*I'm* not. I have BTC as an investment... I'm not spending it. I wouldn't spend it until the market completely neutralizes and there are no more massive gains. I'm no fool.
@_date: 2017-11-28 09:11:47
Next time, on BTC.
@_date: 2019-06-27 14:49:10
Is this a real button?
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:51:50
RemindMe! 1 year

Ok, good.

We've found the entrepreneur.

I know about GDAX... they trade NEO?
@_date: 2017-11-16 17:22:55
I understand your thinking, but at this point it sounds like he is willing to take that risk. If he is, then I say go for it. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:45:11
Ok, people are saying the "video" is real, but is it really him or some other guy from a video recorded in the past?
@_date: 2017-11-19 00:42:17
At least he has a good attitude about it. I would be depressed.
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:47:53
Let me guess, you didn't purchase on coinbase.com
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:08:11

@_date: 2017-11-16 23:01:23
I don't... I'm just the messenger.
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:47:51
Give'm hell!
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:00:33
Why didn't you just "buy" the bitcoin amount you wanted rather than doing a "Deposit"? Don't you instantly retain the current value when you purchase the bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:44:08
That's what I have been thinking all day.
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:26:58
....I guess I'm going to have to purchase a brand new computer just for cashing out....
@_date: 2017-11-27 15:34:12
No, I'm just trying to objectively explain to you that this may not be for you if you have that much *emotion* invested on money that you may not be able/willing to lose. When businesses invest money into their company they are betting also... they might lose. I run my financial life as such. I consider it a business and we won't play with any money we can't lose as a business. You want me to be emotional, but I won't.
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:12:42
Why didn't you just leave it?
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:52:45
Thank you for allowing people like him to be the sacrificial lamb.... ::RaisesHandsInChurch::
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:35:45
Yeah, I guess we could say that...
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:54:03
Boy stop, she was trying to play a game she obviously didn't have the stomach for. She needs to stick to a 401K and leave it at that.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:13:57
So, if I use my credit card.. it's instant you say? If so, I could pay with credit... then pay the card off immediately.
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:02:55
Autumn? The halvening is in Spring.
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:08:26
Worrying is for the weak.
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:52:37
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:44:31
Use a credit card... purchase on coinbase.. then pay it back when you get paid in 10 days.... 
That would be a shark move. By the time you get paid you will have made a profit most likely.

Still got use bitcoin.. .worth it. /s

I'm not an expert on this, but to my knowledge "blockchain" like technologies can be used for other applications that have nothing to do with currency/money... I don't know what it can be used for, but it can be used for other stuff.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:11:45
You must live in the Hamptons... 1.5K isn't a small  amount just because you're in your 20's. When I was in my 20's 1.5K was a LOT of money. I only made 1300 every two weeks in my mid 20's... so 1.5K was half  a month's salary... and I was living paycheck to paycheck.
@_date: 2019-04-23 21:50:43
Short it then.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:36:21
For you.
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:18:13
Why do you say?
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:06:35
I'm going for a Rrari. 
@_date: 2017-11-15 04:51:13
...it lost virtually 50% of the value it gained in 1 day.... yeah, BCH's little skirmish ended. Doesn't mean there won't be another... but that one is dead in the water.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:10:15
Good 
@_date: 2019-04-23 22:05:59
I didn't sell after losing 60-80% value when dealing with just thousands of dollars... why would he sell after losing MILLIONS? I assume if you can play with 100+ million in BTC you can afford to lose it all... why did he sell?
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:56:16
Why late 2020?
@_date: 2018-03-05 00:07:14


Ahem, maybe not all in one day... but it will affect the price.
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:50:31
@_date: 2018-02-16 22:24:56


Because the executives don't completely understand what they are dealing with. They just understand enough to tell their lawyers to trademark/patent stuff... it's probably a normal protocol for any new product within the financial world.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:15:38
... you're in the dip fool.
@_date: 2018-03-04 16:51:40


..uuuh.. no.

Buffet probably said the same thing to himself in the beginning of his ascent.
@_date: 2019-05-03 16:17:03
Is "Pro" free?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:30:29
Yeah, Mr Wonderful.. you bought it all at the WRONG time... someone who bout Amazon at some point was 70% down "at some point" lol....

Fuck it... Bitcoin will insure we'll all be driving Lambos by Winter.
@_date: 2019-05-19 13:32:02
@_date: 2019-05-03 09:45:47
My account is cleared... everything is up and running. I would just use it to liquidate. I wouldn't hold the bitcoin on there for more than a few hours.
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:38:25




@_date: 2019-05-15 02:09:05
I said it would "winter"... I didn't say I 'd be near any snow...
@_date: 2019-05-11 17:39:36
Short it.

Smfh.... Just keep walking, nothing to see here.....
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:18:44
Why are they basing it on a percentage of what's available?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:33:46
Mr Wonderful you will be CRrrrYiiING(in Mr Wonderful's trademark cadence)  5 years from now.

Act like what happened? ...what are you even talking about?
@_date: 2019-05-03 07:23:48
Which exchange is best for this? Any pros or cons based on which exchange?
@_date: 2018-12-23 21:24:05
... but it sounds cool.��
@_date: 2019-05-16 14:33:38
Also, where will this potentially put 1 BTC around 2025-26?
@_date: 2019-05-04 04:00:12
Thanks.. I just realized I already have that setup. What makes it better to use that than the regular account?
@_date: 2019-05-15 01:27:38
"They can't pay their taxes with it etc etc ...." ..yeah, for NOW.
@_date: 2019-05-30 15:20:08
Once it hits 20-40K you might as well be... most people don't even have that much money set aside for retirement.
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:05:00
...bruh, what just happened?
@_date: 2019-05-30 16:05:47
@_date: 2019-05-28 21:57:15
..so what does that mean on the grand scheme of things?
@_date: 2019-05-30 03:06:18
True.
