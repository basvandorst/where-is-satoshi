Oh, the irony. $100k for *that* website? LOL

How to monitor the number of clients using XT? I really think someone needs to make a site which should monitor and display the real-time adoption rate from Core to XT.

That's like a speech from Braveheart. /facepalm
TL;DR:  Don't worry about Bitcoin price fluctuations as they will keep going up in the long run.

Worthless in what sense? The bitcoins will be conserved whether the network adopts XT or not. But i think that the exchange rate will vary. Maybe, 1 BTCXT will be worth a LOT of BTC.

I'm not sure what's going on here - i'm a new Bitcoin user with about $10 of bitcoins traded a few days ago. But the exchange rate API for blockchain.info doesn't seem operational anymore. What is the next best exchange rate API? I tried BitPay and the exchange rate matches the previous value that i had with blockchain.info although Coinbase is giving me a little bit more value.

Yes, this is good news for Bitcoin owners. I actually campaigned a little to get the bitcoin payment option on the main humblebundle, since it used to be available only on the weekly bundle page. The last main bundle didn't have the bitcoin payment option though, but i'm glad it's back for the new bundle.
P.S. Although right now, it's probably not a good time to be spending your bitcoins since the currency exchange is really bad which is supposed to be only temporary. I might just buy the bundle using my Paypal or something.

This is exactly my issue and what happened to me. I was just about to sign up to Coinbase but i thought to google for some info since it was asking for my name. Now, i don't know which site to sign up to... Where to start to get a Bitcoin wallet?

I don't think the OP was specifically asking about Bitcoin XT. It makes things sound really desperate if people think that XT's adoption is imminent, which is a nice concept but highly unlikely to happen in real life.

Recently, i created a thread to promote Bitcoin adoption on Steam (for those who don't know, it's a major online digital sales store for PC games) in and here is one of the responses... 
It really is an uphill battle to introduce people to Bitcoin and make them understand its benefits. I really think that Bitcoin needs its own company to promote its network through various deals and advertising, educate the public and create awareness of Bitcoin, etc, similar to Mozilla Corporation vs Mozilla Foundation (FYI, Mozilla is the developer of the famous Firefox browser).

I am about to use Bitcoin for the very first time and i honestly have no idea at all where to begin. I was just seconds away from signing up to Coinbase (since it was one of the suggested Bitcoin options on the site where i want to make a purchase) and Coinbase appears to be some sort of default portal to Bitcoin, but i could be wrong. 
Can an experienced Bitcoin user recommend the safest bitcoin site/software/whatever that would ensure my 100% anonymity and is easy to use for payments and receive funds as well?
P.S. Since Coinbase appears to send real names of people during transactions, could i sign up to their site using a fake name? Just wondering if that would cause problems eventually with my Bitcoin account?
