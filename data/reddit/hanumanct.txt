Multicast IP video delivery over DSL is very much the same as cable. The only difference is the transport layer.

Hidden firewall in the cable box? No way Op. 
Internet traffic flows through the residential gateway, not the set top box. 
I assume you're talking about UVerse, which is a product from Microsoft (now Ericsson, sold about 3 years ago). I worked on these set tops for about 10 years and no internet traffic from the home flows through these set tops, so there's no way to block traffic.

The residential gateway is the modem, not the cable box. Nothing routes through the cable box, Ops title is misinformed.

I am 100% sure OP is wrong. I worked on engineering for Uverse (Mediaroom) at Microsoft and know a great deal about those set top boxes (mostly moto VIP 12xx). The only traffic routing through the set top boxes is whole home DVR, and it isn't actually routing. 
They must be talking about the residential gateway. You can't block traffic from something you're not flowing through.

Yup, MOCA. Absolutely terrible. It's getting phased out with the newer boxes.
Normal bootstrap for a Mediaroom set top box is about 30 seconds. But if you reset the power 3 times before boot, or hold down the OK and down buttons, you'll do what's called a DRA which re-downloads the boot ROM and application ROM which would take 10 - 15 minutes, but that only happens during upgrades or the conditions I mentioned above, not every single time.

It's doing a TFTP download of the boot rom which is about 20MB and then an HTTP download of the app rom can be around 120MB. The files are pulling from a remote server, which usually resides in the largest city closest to you.
