It certainly seems absurd.

Because it's fun

So why exactly is a 5 cent tip an advertisement?
Is there no room for tipping for a non-ulterior motive?
We can't understand the intentions of every coin tipper, but I think in the vast majority of cases, it's not for self-promotion or similar reasons.
Tip values online can't be compared to traditional tipping in real-life, since it's not an equivalent environment.

Doge haters gonna hate. How is tipping someone an advertisement?
Tipping someone 5 cents is less of an advertisement than tipping $1.

I guess part of it is to do with user familiarity and production standards.
Yes you can go blind or be killed by badly produced alcohol, but you're not very likely to come across it. And you can do similar damage by overdosing on perfectly good alcohol, still most people will know when they've had enough.
Random drugs bought over the darknet is a different story though - I think it's reasonable to be concerned about drug availability that may not be held up to any significant production standards (apart from user feedback). The fact that standards can't more easily be applied due to the illegality of the product doesn't necessarily mean you can't be concerned about it regardless.

The stats don't bear this out at all, I guess you're assuming US levels of gun prevalence.
"The number of gun murders per capita in the US in 2012 - the most recent year for comparable statistics - was nearly 30 times that in the UK, at 2.9 per 100,000 compared with just 0.1 (per 100,000 in the UK)."
edit: Misunderstood the point you were making, apologies

Yeah not the best argument at all. You would think Sagan would have been able to better differentiate between slapstick as entertainment vs as a literalist role model, or implying that enjoying it somehow precludes academic activities. Seems like a lazy (or overly pessimistic) point.
Reminds me of the HW Bush quote - "We need a nation closer to the Waltons than to the Simpsons".
