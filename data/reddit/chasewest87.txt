I'll continue with my approach thus far - put in a certain amount of FIAT each week to buy coins with and hodl. It's like the Steam Summer Sale - everything is between 50% - 90% off :)

I'll tell you that I have a little of all of those. I absolutely love Factom though

It's worth buying every day :) Investing small amounts over time is the best way, in my opinion. If you're looking for a huge gain, you could always take your chances on any of the various altcoins...but those are obviously much higher risk. If you're here to invest long term, bitcoin would be the safest.

Looks like I was doing it wrong by playing on Full Tilt for free :(

I prefer using GDAX over Coinbase, but Gemini over both. 
@_date: 2017-07-08 21:35:00
I can't :( All this anticipation has me stopped up. More time to read reddit at least
@_date: 2017-07-09 00:51:41
There's some grunting in there that adds at least one more syllable, I swear.
@_date: 2017-07-15 21:45:08
I personally prefer Gemini
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:21:25
I completely agree. I said something similar [here]( this morning.


It's definitely the safest of all right now, besides being in fiat ofc.

I wish I could even afford to play games in 4k :P I'll just stick to Rocket League!
@_date: 2017-07-09 04:25:19
Absolutely love it.

Yeah, it's difficult to be confident right now. However you're comfortable doing it is how I'd go about it. For me, it's a set amount each week that I buy BTC on gemini. Once the bank transfer goes through I move that to Bittrex and divide that up among a few alts. It's not lookin' great right now, but I've researched the coins I'm in and believe in them.

2:36 ... I hope that's PM, but based on the picture I'm guessing not :( As a fellow father, I can sympathize. Go hodl that baby.

Spoken from experience - I'm no stranger to the  :P

I'm completely the same way. The game feels different on ps4 as well...I can't quite put my finger on it, but pc is much more smooth. Can't wait until my kids are old enough to get rekt in RL. Savage!
@_date: 2017-07-11 04:16:00
You've made a wise decision. If you don't hold the coins...they're not your coin :D Keep 'em secret, keep 'em safe.
@_date: 2017-07-11 14:43:16
Looks to me that we have 3 here on PC...Jus' sayin' ;) ;) ;)
@_date: 2017-07-11 06:13:01
RL isn't the same unless it's on PC - just need a better PC/Monitor :P

LOL! Love me some minesweeper...only with max tiles and min bombs. 1 click wins!
