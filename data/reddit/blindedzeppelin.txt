Forgive my ignorance , but how long would it take on average for someone with the most basic rig to solve 1 block?

But I am assuming people aren't stupid enough to buy from an untrusted seller or a seller without a 100% feedback score..I guess you never know though

btcReport.  Can set price alerts if it goes above or below a target price that you set.  And beautiful UI.

This is true.  HOWEVER, this ebay thing shows the inherent value in bitcoin and I believe indicate that its price will go up.  If people are paying $500 for 1 bitcoin , because they want it -now, this shows its value. 
 Something is worth what people are willing to pay for it.
