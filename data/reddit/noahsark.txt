The fees would tell a different story at this point...

Well if you're talking about the Dao, Vitalik didn't roll the chain back.  The community voted to roll the chain back.  Vitalik posed the question to the community.  The community voted unanimously to roll back the hack.

It is retaining decentralisation though.  It can't be mined with Asics.  There aren't the crazy amount of server farms setup for mining ETH as there are for BTC.  Mining ETH is still profitable at home. Also ETH's circulating supply is going to cap out around 100 million.  It won't be exactly that number, but should be around that number.

Of course it is antifragile.  But you are being negligent if you believe Proof of stake couldn't be antifragile as well.  
If you believe in antifragility, and that you cannot steal someone else's BTC because of it, or fool the system into thinking you have more than you do, then proof of stake must be able to work, and work as well as or better than Proof of work.

To run a node in geth takes about 30gb of space.
Also look at the charts on etherscan.io and blockchain.info for transactions per day.  Ether does around double of BTC.  The only other blockchain processing as many or more than ETH is steem, but they use masternodes.

“Any software scheme that has been thought up by humans has been defeated by humans. ”
Aren’t you contradicting yourself by saying that all software can be broken but bitcoin is perfect and never will be?  At the end of the day bitcoin is software.

That is such a strawman argument.  You could say the same thing about Bitcoin Core.

The most advanced tech has nothing to do with how much fiat value someone has placed on a token or coin.  If I choose to spend $100000 for a dogecoin it has no impact on how the network handles that transaction.  It’s still 1 dogecoin in the networks eyes.  
So in that case the only rational way of thinking about the how good the networks are is by the amount of nodes and the transactions per day.  Of which ETH has double the transactions and double the nodes.

Well if you simply look at active addresses in Bitcoin vs. other platforms (one measure for on chain usage), Bitcoin looks to have about 60% dominance.
* BTC: 600-700k
* ETH: 200k
* EOS: 100k
* DASH: 60k
* TRX: 50k
* XMR: 20k
* XRP: 5k
* NEO: 3k

To be fair though the ethereum ice age was coming on that chain though so there was no incentive to continue mining.  Such a simple software trick to allow hardforks and deadlines.

This is exactly what they are saying though.  Because of the huge swings (10x in a year) it isn't reliable as a currency.  Currencies need to be 'relatively' stable.  It's no good to a business or to other people if they can say buy a burger for 0.001 BTC now, but then tomorrow that BTC is worth 10-20% more.  It makes people scared to spend money.  It's a very political question about whether that's a good thing or not, but I don't think people should get into the mindset of not eating today so they can maybe buy a little more food tomorrow.  I think in many cases that's dangerous.  That's why they are saying saying it's more like a gold standard at this point.

This article’s claims are fictitious.  Bitcoin was never illegal to own in China.  Exchanges were banned, exchanges are still banned.  Nothing has changed, this article sources another article which sources another article which sources a decision by a court that bitcoin is (as it always has been) property.

Talking about it gives them more power, just ignore this bullshit and it’ll go away, don’t give them an audience.

I think it's a fair question.  Their motto is:


"Digital assets", not specifically bitcoin.

Wow, regulated price discovery and a trusted and regulated custodian.  I wonder what Bakkt will use this for in the long run?
