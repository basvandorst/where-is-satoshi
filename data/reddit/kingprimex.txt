well, you know bitcoin protocol is using cryptography for generating public and private keys. I suspect from that post that is using signcryption for transfering fund and signing the packets in a secure way. Signcryption takes care of both encryption and signing of the packet without being needed a third party ( EG: CA(certificate authorithy)) Practically creating a foulproof network in which everything is signed

The problem for me is that i don t know where to search for that algorithm (which file ) and i having hard times implementing it myself. Playing with Openssl is not that easy ...

where did you get 5k dollars ? Curious about investing . You had any info on the bitcoin , or your heart told you it s time to invest?

Hmm. BitPay. The new paypal!

SUre. I have to implement a type of signcryption and since this field of cryptography is pretty new, i couldn't find a library that has already implemented it. That being said i have to generate the keys, the public parameters , do the computations , basically everything , just following a mathematical algorithm using OpenSSL. The flow of the algorithm is pretty easy , the problem i have with is doing those god damn computations. I have to use BIGNUMS(512 bits) and create 2 prime numbers of which (1)q | (p-1) (q,p) prime numbers. This is freaking killing me. I Generate p, and i have to generate q on base of  (1).

Gambling is wrong. I also did it , but at least i did it with doge, so not losing as much as you did. What have gotten you into that gambling madness. DOesnt everyone  say  DO NOT GAMBLE?
@_date: 2014-05-12 19:43:36
hmmm, never received a tip from bitcoin :). Are they as gively as dogecoin?
@_date: 2014-07-05 18:09:30
crap. i lost the tip train , right ? o well. back to work then :D
@_date: 2015-05-13 09:41:36
Good luck on future events

wait, whatttt? what did i miss ? a bitcoin tipping spree? :(

oh my god. I am gonna be rich! thank you mate. Go bitCoin

now is the time to bring more and more to the table.

There is also a misspelled phrase when I want to sell crypto for paypal. It says " Unfortunately our available Stock of this Cryptocoin is less than you wanted to Buy. We adjusted the Amount to the Maximum we can process right now." I wanted to SELL not BUY!!

i don't enjoy social login. I guess bitcoin is all about this. Right?

@_date: 2015-03-08 17:58:18
well i tried to buy , but it said is not available in my country :). Also it specifies american card or bank acount us based
@_date: 2015-03-08 13:09:51
I would like to buz small piece of bitcoin. Let's say $2 worth of bits ... no place though 
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:54:28
nobody sells for 2 dollars , lol
@_date: 2015-03-08 09:53:20
Yeah, well i am not an american citizen :)
@_date: 2015-02-03 20:03:06
