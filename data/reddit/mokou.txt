I suppose asking what a company whose entire business model relies on selling SHA-256 miners to people would achieve by decimating the market for SHA-256 miners would be foolish of me.

It's worth pointing out that whilst the Ghash.io pool is zero percent fee, a huge portion of their mining capacity comes from their Cex.io arm, which charges 3% on every GH they "sell". Plus, of course, given that they are selling access to hardware that they already own, "unsold" capacity is certainly mining for them.

Arguably the community already spoke when it refused to stop mining there.

This attitude is perpetuated rather aggressively by this subreddit. 90% of the time when people ask for advice on mining here, the top response is "Don't bother, there's no money in it, just buy BTC instead"

It is /possible/ to make a profit, but by no means guaranteed. At the moment, 1gh/s of capacity costs 0.045 BTC, which is about $40 in fiat. 1gh/s, at the current difficulty, equates to about $5 a month. (Including that you merge mine Ix, Dev and Name-coins.). This puts your ROI at 8 months, assuming that nothing radical happens to the market. 
If you bought your GH/S's earlier, just before the massive spike in BTC's value, you're probably already operating at a profit.

Isn't this something that would be (indirectly) accomplished by a proof of stake mechanism? I know that's not what PoS is /for/, but it'd still work.

The openness of the source does nothing to prevent them attacking the system so they can sit and hoard zero days. They've got enough experts and a large enough budget to do it.

Cheap hosted miners through cex.io is probably their number one draw. It's essentially the pool for "casuals" who don't want to deal with buying, building, and maintaining a mining array of their own. Given the number of nontechnical speculators the bitcoin market has attracted, it's not entirely surprising that the site with the "easiest" system and the prettiest interface has garnered such support.

The issue is that the throwaway emails are being used to resell the keys outside of the bundles themselves at places like G2A. 
You buy a few hundred bundles for some miniscule fraction of a coin each, wait for the bundle to stop being available, then dump all your keys onto G2A at slightly below the now back to normal market price, then reap the profit. 
Humble is against this practise because it undermines their credibility as a vendor. Why would a dev put a game of theirs in a bundle if they know that they're only going to see 30% of a penny-shaving from it whilst some other enterprise sells the humble key at near retail and gives them nothing?

Even Wave got a couple of months, and that was still in unsupported beta

Given that literally any idiot can get an SSL cert for free with minimal verification, the lock alone doesn't cut it anymore.

I've got 8 ASICMiners hooked up to a Raspberry Pi. Whilst I know I won't ever turn a profit on that, I don't really care. I believe in bitcoin as a currency and want to support the network and encourage /actual use of bitcoin/ rather than just hoarding coins to speculate and sell for fiat. 
Plus the way they flicker whenever they earn a share is pretty hypnotic.
So good for you for getting one and setting it up.
