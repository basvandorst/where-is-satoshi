I usually just lurk over here because I'm very uneducated on Bitcoin. But this sparked a question I now have.  
  
Is the loss of bitcoins when people die or lose Thier key or storage a problem? You can't just "print" new Bitcoins after we reach the cap from what I'm understanding.  
  
Or is there a solution to this? Or is it not even a problem?

Last post was 1 year ago. I'd say it's due for a repost.

I don't see why it can't be a hobby. I get what you are saying but personally I don't know enough about Bitcoin and the economy to spend all or a large part of my money on Bitcoin. Thank you for all the information and websites you mentioned I will check them out. :)

Heroism has its boundaries of course. Good on ya.

1 Bitcoin is quite a bit of money to invest. Especially to invest in something you know exist but don't know much about. It's also a pain in the ass to purchase Bitcoin. And if Bitcoin fails, **which is definitely a possibility!**, You're money is gone. Implying 100% of 24% would and could buy Bitcoin is ridiculous.

Hey,  
I haven't bought any Bitcoin yet but I'm looking into it.   Two days ago I made a coinbase account but I have not yet verified my identity or added a payment method. I also made a personal wallet on a different site. I would like so have a couple of Bitcoin fractions as a hobby  just to watch it go up and down in price, preferably up of course.  Buying Bitcoin with PayPal would be the easiest for me. After registering a coinbase account i found out they do not handle PayPal payment.  
  
What do you recommend?
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:16:12
I assume I should keep an eye out for scammers?

It's magic internet money. That's all you need to know.
