Her conservative religious views have nothing to do with blockchain technology. ��

Not sure the point of the post. Not particularly informative or adding anything to the pool of knowledge. Seems generally like trolling. If intended to be humorous ok. Just don’t see the humor but that’s ok. Not everyone will. Seems to be poking fun at someone who has expressed their religious freedoms which are protected in the USA as are other views and opinions. Why someone feels the need to denigrate someone’s views for humor, entertainment, or whatever reason has never really been something I understand. Enough hate and anger in this world already. Why one would inject it here is disappointing. Blockchain doesn’t care about ones views or perspectives. Anyone can support it. Why do people want to place roadblocks to adoption? Seems like it’s counterproductive

So funny...when this first broke I put out the same comment. Several freaked out...then removed their posts when I wouldn’t engage. 
Yes 1984. This is a governments wet dream. Tracking every single expenditure forever on an immutable ledger. There are solutions but  the risk is real and stakes will be high. So when like Japan our birth rates drop, massive government spending, no one to fund our overhead it will be critical that currency movement is tracked. Longer than 2 years, but coming nonetheless. I’m looking out to 15 -20 years for full on engagement with a critical inflection point around 7-10 years as tech, governments, and the political landscape shift become more engrained.

Correct. Honestly that's what I am trying to find. Not discounting Bitcoin, it's been very good, love the idea much more than the financial benefits and will support it even if it tanks. Just reading Reddit though not finding good resources to research the development that you speak of...lots of ATH memes. So where are best resources to research that development so can assess long term 3 yr, 5 yr prospects which in tech industry is long term it seems.

You will know it's mainstream when you can pay strippers with Bitcoin...post that pic and you have a winner! I just can't figure how it could ever truly be popular until then ;(

Wow. Cryptocurrencies could accelerate bank runs if the market were to collapse. And that’s the best reason that’s put forth in opposition to cryptocurrencies? That’s almost comical.
