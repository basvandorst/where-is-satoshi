You are right, and people downvoting you are dumb. It literally says brute force on their homepage. "We have created a highly optimized multi-threaded C++ program to perform the brute-force decryption. "

Great, this is good to know, thanks!
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:34:48
I feel like such a moron and I'm just glad you were here to point it out.

Thanks for this! I'm looking to put five figures into bitcoin, so looking at Trezor it seems like a good way to do it. I wonder if there is a way to have a backup Trezor as well. I'll do more research, but thanks a lot for your answer!

Thank you for humbling me, I can see now that my ego is quite inflated.
@_date: 2014-12-28 08:01:11
Thanks, but I'm trying to do research by posting here! I think maybe it's not a good time for me to buy bitcoins after all.

It says up to six hours, I've taken a screenshot of the website and uploaded here: 
This is very disappointing. Not this particular transaction, but to find out that this is to be expected for Bitcoin in general(?). :(

On second thought, I'd really rather you kept it and bought yourself a coffee. I'm really the one that should be tipping YOU! Thanks again for the help.
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:23:49
Thanks, that helps! A lot!

As I said above, perhaps I'm spoiled but anything over a few seconds just seems really strange to me. This is a brand new technology. Something just doesn't feel right about it, personally.

I understand that in theory Paypal or credit cards could take months, but in real-world practical use, this hasn't been the case. I've used both hundreds of times and it's been instant every single time. This is my first time using Bitcoin and it's extremely disappointing, to put it nicely.
@_date: 2014-12-30 08:59:12
Maybe I'm spoiled, but this is still a ridiculously long time for a payment system that is supposed to be cutting edge technology. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:21:33
No really, I read it. I understand the theoretical bit, but I've never had the frozen account situation. That seems like a rare thing, if more than say 10% of users experienced that the system would not function. I understand how Bitcoin is theoretically could be more logical but it really didn't work for me today.
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:22:17
My problem is that I used Bitcoin for the first time ( a very practical use ) and it was not the experience I'd hoped for. 
@_date: 2014-12-30 09:41:01
Wow, that's really generous, and thanks for reaching out. This is also a good opportunity to learn how to use ChangeTip. I'm curious if I could forward that money to a charity, and what the "syntax" would be to do so?
@_date: 2014-12-30 16:33:44
I had no idea it was so exclusive, I apologize for asking.
@_date: 2014-12-28 07:42:41
Do you know of a guide to setting this up? I don't even know what you mean about anything that you just said!
@_date: 2015-01-04 08:00:37
Sadly I think most people have simply realized it's overvalued. Even after mainstream America has been introduced to Bitcoin during the Bowl game, they shrug and say "meh".
No one cares about a new mediocre way to use money on the internet that causes more problems for the individual user than it solves--even if hypothetically someday it could solve problems of much larger scale.
Now it's a race to see who can sell these things and get a few hundred bucks a piece.

I'm not going to join your cult if you're mean to me.
@_date: 2014-12-28 07:43:32
Thank you.
