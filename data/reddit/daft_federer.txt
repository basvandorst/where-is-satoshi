When looking to buy bitcoin with Paypal it is important to consider that fees will be higher than using another payment method. These alternatives include SEPA bank transfer, credit card, and cash. Generally speaking, using PayPal to get btc is the most expensive way to do so. That being said, you are only looking for a small amount so fees is not a too important factor for consideration. There are actually plenty of places (compared to 5 years ago). Take a look through the complete list of [sites to buy bitcoin]( and select the places that say "buy with PayPal". Remember that this payment method does not guarantee anonymity in any way. For that I would recommend a p2p (person 2 person) cash transaction like localbitcoins, or even sometimes bitcoin ATMS.

You have done a good job, it's an excellent site. It does indeed serve as a reference for newcomers - i know a few that want to purchase bitcoin. In my opinion, there should be more tutorials available for beginners, explaining which sites are trustworthy and secure and which should be recommended. 
A lot of people ask me how to buy btc with cash. So, the list in the comments above has several outstanding services for that purpose. There's a good range to chose from, perhaps you should include one or two on your site also. And for people searching how to invest bitcoin and hold for long term purposes I would advise more information on offline wallets, how to use them, and find secure sites to buy the hardware from. 
Spot on concerning the options for visa, mastercard, and sepa bank transfer - your site clearly details this in an informative way. As a closing comment, I would suggest divining your list into sections on where to buy bitcoin depending on each continent or country (eg USA, Australia, UK, Ireland, New Zealand, Europe ...) and currency (usd, euro, aud, zar, cad, hkd, gbp ...) as many users look for this too.
