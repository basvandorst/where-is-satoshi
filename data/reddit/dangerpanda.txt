Here is why I'm worried about Bitcoin, and it's simply that it's being treated like a stock rather than a currency.
If I want to convert my AUD to USD, I can do so at a rate which is based on economic and market value, I can change it back at close to the same rate and everyone is happy.
If I want to convert to AUD to BTC then I have to pay a rate based on what another individual is selling them for, and because everyone seems to be in BTC for profit rather than to support the currency, that means I'll likely end up paying more and it's not based on real value.
This pushes up the value, and means I take a risk with every purchase, and as a vendor I would take a risk accepting BTC as well.
The value of BTC right now simply isn't real, if you have $1mil dollars of BTC you cannot convert this for $1mil worth of product or currency. 
Volume is low because people just aren't using it, because there isn't really anywhere to use it.
Supporters of BTC are pushing hard to realise this value by getting companies to accept BTC, but it's more from a selfish point of view so they can realise value and make there own profits more than to support the currency.
The kicker is that essentially the early investors and big holders of BTC have essentially become like the modern bank. They are hoarding and manipulating the markets for there own profit. 
This is not the way BTC was meant to be, and frankly I can't see any benefit in using BTC as it currently is over any other currency.

But we're talking about a currency, without liquidity it's useless.
I could use my $1mil in any other currency immediately, so why would I bother with BTC?
The talk of liquidity highlights another part of the issue. That is people treat BTC as a stock, and they expect to make a profit out of owning a BTC which drives prices up without any intrinsic value behind it.

The people in this subreddit like to ignore the downfalls of BTC rather than address them... Prepare for downvotes.

This is a terrible article, and doesn't actually address a lot of these concerns about BTC.
Pretending they aren't a concern, doesn't make them go away.

Because there was only so long the market could be artificially inflated like it is.
Let's just say you're an early adopter, and right now you are sitting on 10000 BTC.
Can you convert those BTC for $1,000,000 worth of currency or product? No, you can't. This means the value isn't real. 
It was only a matter of time until it readjusted.

Well it wouldn't be the first time hackers manipulated a site to gain money or change prices...

It's increased with BTC though, because there is no central authority, it isn't a 'recognised' currency and is largely associated with purchasing illegal goods.
Never mind we are talking about ~$15000 worth of Bitcoins here.
If I gave you $15000 for a product, I would have an invoice/receipt. I would know who you were and where to find you, and I could take you to court to reclaim that money if necessary.
If I transfer BTC to a string on the internet, I have nothing. No recourse. I've sent money off 'somewhere' and that's it.
Don't get me wrong, BTC is a good plan, but as usual people are the flaw in the system.

I can login again too, that was a bit worrying though...

I agree, I support BTC as an alternate currency, what I don't support it as is a money making scheme which is what it's become.
The idea behind BTC is a great one, but because people have been using it purely for person gain rather than exchange it's lost it's purpose.
I lost my faith when I discovered people own 'shares' in a 'company' on an internet forum, which specialises in making hardware which soul purpose is to turn electricity into internet credits. 
I've seen trades of hundred of thousand of dollars worth of these shares. But of course, no one is actually putting the dollars into the system, it's early adopters trading numbers around.

I'm curious about this also...

Interesting you use BFL as an example, since they don't actually accept bitcoins as a payment method the lack of liquidity in the currency mustn't be worth the risk for them.
