Looks like you set a weekly $125 buy on your account. 03/14, 03/21 (discovered the next day), and 03/28. I don't know how to disable that, but I bet their support can help you.

Many people don't know how to install a new browser. And most don't care to.
This could boost BTC market size, but it certainly won't make it mainstream.

Coinbase sucks. No trust in their service. Suspicions growing.

Coinbase sucks. Increasingly sounds like they're in serious trouble. Maybe if they stopped sucking so much. Or maybe they suck because they're in trouble...

I never had problems with Coinbase. Until I did.

Post is great. Comment was a joke that made a lot more sense when there were only two other comments. New to reddit and still learning that comment threads aren't chronological...

Repost through a link of a previously deleted thread, from a now deleted account. Not at all shady.
