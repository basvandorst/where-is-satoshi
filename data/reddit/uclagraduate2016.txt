I didnt see it as rude.  No one forced you to sign up for a 20% interest credit card.  If you rack up debt and then claim "this isn't fair" then you're playing the "victim card".
Being offended is a weakness and not a virtue.  Lighten up my dude.

Another name for the cloud is "someone else's computer".  Bad advice if you ask me to store on cloud.  You should be 100% in control of your key.  Even if your key is encrypted.  What happens if your cloud gets hacked?  Or cloud shuts down?  Or cloud denies you access?  Or disgruntled employee steals or erases cloud?  You better hope you have a backup you control or your key is gone.

Even if the USA banned it.  There's tons of developing nations that need stable currencies.  Bitcoin is worldwide.  The USA doesn't need bitcoin as much as other places and it may never be fully adopted there.  5 billion people have no access to banking...bitcoin gives those people access to the same banking privledges.

Not sure either.  I haven't seen anyone saying that.  He should have linked to posts or comments supporting his arguement.   
I think hes making a snap judgment or starting off with that just so his post has meaning.  Good cop, bad cop kinda thing.  Pretty  shallow way to express your opinion if you ask me.
