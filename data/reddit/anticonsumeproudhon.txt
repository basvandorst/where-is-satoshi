Complexity,time,materials. Youre not too clever are you? Compare say a doctor to a fry cook, the doctor is inherently going to be paid more for his surgical practices to flipping a burger.  You could easily use a clock in clock out system that is already used in manufacturing and taxi jobs. In reality with the whole digital currency your just changing one master for another.

Dont trust crypto everybody!, its just one fiat currency replacing another!!

Dude, i dont care if its labor notes, it can be anything thats not backed by precious metals,fiat or digital, not to say that digital in a physical form like some kind of cryptonote cant be used, its just we have no idea of where crypto came from its been fun fuckin with ya since you seen to get mad pretty easily.

Im naive? Im not against money, but  money needs to actually be worth somthing, i suggest our money be backed by labor, you really dont know or understand how to read into a quote do you? This is the reason things like this need to be said over and over again, because the ignorant people of this world didnt get it the first trillion times and no one is willing to make any actual change.

I was saying capitalism is dressed up, and off you dont believe money holds any power over you, you are obviously ignorant of how society actually works.
@_date: 2018-06-06 22:00:36
Im clearly not the stupid one, your too comfortable with the society you live in, just because YOU think im the embodiment of teenage angst dosent make me anyless correct.

No reason, wbu?

Dood you were the one having an autustic fit i was laughing at you fan boying hard on btc,the whole point of my rambling is not to say someone controls btc, but btc could eventually control you and this maybe what the creators intended.
Democracy is just as authoritarian as an aristocracy, also i get the feeling your a capitalist instead of an actual freemarket advocate, and free markets are the farthest thing from democracy as capitalism has turned it into, free markets should be a person governing unto themselves without any form of social engineering taking place or usury as capitalism time and time again intends. Capitalism is no better then the Soviet Union , its just dressed up to make it look more appealing with everything inside of it being based on inauthenticity.

No need, i got my point across. You shouldnt allow your life to be controlled by ones and zeros or gold for that matter....
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:09:10
Ok? You just sound like a bumblimg idiot who has no actual solution to a problem, im not even commited to the idea of a labor backed currency(although it's worked in the past you imbecile), I have no problem with currency being backed with any other materials aside from precious metals, or numbers that mean nothing. Like i said before you illiterate trogldyte im not against money, im against those who control it, the people who you are seemingly advocating for.
@_date: 2018-06-05 05:21:02
You threw the first stone friend, also if you dont think you are being controlled through your currency you are clearly ignorant of the major problems that society faces, that are very obviously coverd up. And just because a currency isnt controlled by one person(or institution) dosent mean you arent a slave to someone or somthing, we dont even know who created btc, all we know is his or her or if its a group their pseudonym.

Prefer gold? Not nesecerilly, i believe like diamonds, gold's value can be artificially raised due to a corporation or government withholding its minting/mining aswell as making a stockpile, im not anti-tech however i dont believe we should give so much of our lives to tech, and no doubt ted and i share some philosophical opinions, im mostly anti-capitalist/bank and pro-free market and anti-consumerism, and i understand that btc has value and i have no nesecery problems with crypto, only if it became a nations primary form of exchange would i have a problem with it as i intend no limit to free exchange so long as that exchange is mutually beneficial.

As i said with the other guy, im not married to the idea, its just somthing that has been employed in the past, and i was mostly just twisting his nipples on it i would preffer a physical form of exchange (hell, even btc if it had physical form) and im also critical of its origins, we have no real idea who or what created it aside from a name, for all we know someone like a state or corp invented it and it could simply be a psyop not to sound paranoid, im not saying crypto is inherently bad, i just believe we should he wary of it, and critical when needed as it is soo new. Also we need to wary that this currency dosent become our master as greenbacks have, with overqualified people who should be in higher posistions then they are working dead end jobs because their retirement got blown in an economic collapse such as circa 2008. Im anti-capitalist myself, especially pertaining to banks but i have no issue with true free markets, or 'freed markets'.

Btw, im an anarchist so the govt thing dosent fly with me , also trust me its not my reading comprehension its just your down syndrome driviel that gives me a headache and i cant take this much stupidity all at once,(muh capitalism, muh crypto) also the fed isnt part of the govt, its a conglometate of several private banks ya dingus. Money should serve you, you shouldnt serve money, and to answer the question on who "controls the currency" its simple enough to have a piece of paper or cotten with a denomination of hours on it specifying that, that note is a physical representation of ones labor(distributed by workplaces), and individuals are free to trade theese notes as they please, and again im not married to this idea its just we need to move past fiat/precious materials in some way or another theres copper or titanium which are just as good if not better then gold/fiat.

Yes, any labor really, again my problem is btcs digital basis, and its lack of material value ajd material form  which in this case is based on a machines labor, however mining has become expensive and not easily accessible to the laymen.
@_date: 2018-06-05 04:30:19
Why? 
@_date: 2018-06-05 15:29:37
The part about it being a new master was a philosophical criticism (subtlety you cant seem to pick up on) just like today's money.


How do you know?, just saying it kinda does matter who created it, because we still know very little about it for all we know it is controlled in some way and if not it still would end up controlling us, and i have done plenty of research on the subjectof currency, admittedly not blockchain however im not the in making a fool out of themselves because im not the one who gets eaisily insulted over my precious btc.


Well at least youve come to terms with it.
