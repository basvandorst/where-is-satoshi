This isn't exactly crazy. 
Look at the market:
Gov and corporate bonds are all negative yield, so there is no point putting in money here to lose money. 
Interest rates in banks are either near 0 or negative, so you lose money on inflation or bank theft alone if you keep it in the bank.
Stock market is at all time highs due to stock buy backs from cheap lending and QE, and the volatility is controlled completely by the fed and political manipulation with the so called “trade talks”. It should be noted that american GDP is actually less than inflation, meaning that corporations are faking growth with debt (see repeat of 2008 with faking growth with debt in housing market). All the new ipos this year are all bleeding money with some at 50% retrace correction to the down side.
Do you park your money in gold or silver? There is no guarantee that there is ANY backing of precious metals because the entire metals “market” is paper trading. 
Then there is crypto, which has out performed all of the above (assuming you are technical engineering and economics wise).
If anything you should be at least 30-40% crypto in your portfolio.

I am not a financial advisor. 
I only recommend investing in crypto projects after spending at least 1 year understanding the technical aspects (engineering, mathematics, economics), and of course trying the tech for your self before buying anything more than 100 dollars worth at 2019 levels of inflation.
Nothing is a sure thing. Not even ethereum, xrp, or bitcoin maybe be around within the next decade. Dont invest more you can afford to lose.

No. Layer 1 shouldn’t change because it is fine. See lightning network. Lightning transactions are already private

Sucks. Good thing 10k isnt as bad as making a bad investment in stocks.

Any software engineer worth their weight understands that lightning network is not scalable. 
Big blocks is a potential solution forward: see segwit2x proposal

Its very difficult to guarantee that metals have a certain level of purity without a trusted third party with the equipment. 
If the economy does sour, it is dangerous to hold physical precious metals of any kind.

Bitpay is a scam! 
If you want to pay with BTC, [Pay with credit card, then sell BTC on exchange]( (0 fees).
lightning network has 0 fees too. 
At the end of the day, BTC is a store of value. idk why you are selling your BTC when you should hodl in bull market.

Bitcoin is used to transfer millions of dollars worth of VALUE for $2.00, which beats international bank wire fees guaranteed. If you cannot afford $2.00 fees, you shouldn't be using bitcoin, because you don't have value.
