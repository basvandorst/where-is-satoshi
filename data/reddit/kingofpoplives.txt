So here is Professor Bitcorn finally owning up to why hates Bitcoin -- it takes power away from him and his central banker buddies.
Predicting the price would crash didn't cause a crash like he hoped, so now he is trying to scare people into banning it.
He is 100% correct that Bitcoin adoption will undermine sovereign currencies. Eventually it's going to kill them all. Nothing can be done to stop that now.

Maybe if you want to day trade and need volatility, but if you're a long term investor this is also good. More merchants = more press = more useful bitcoin = more adoption = higher price.

How were things financed before inflationary fiat currencies were the norm?
I have a feeling the market will figure this out, one way or another. Maybe financing will go more towards equity instead of loans. Maybe interest rates will be lower. If deflation is merely 2-5% instead of 10% how does that change things?
I also think that, once BTC reaches equilibrium, it will not be deflationary 100% of the time. For example, consider gold, the standard example of a deflationary commodity. The price of gold doesn't always go up. When people get worried about inflation, it goes up, when the fear subsides, it goes down. On the whole it continues to go up, but that is primarily a consequence of being measured against the dollar, which always goes down. I would argue that it's not the value of gold that's moving, but the value of the dollar.
The price of BTC could (and likely will in my estimation) skyrocket in terms of the dollar. And this price can keep moving even after BTC reaches a fairly stable equilibrium with real world goods. The exchange rate right now appears to be driven by BTC increasing in value, but towards the end it will be the dollar going down.
Another interesting question that comes to mind: given comparable stability and liquidity, why would anyone choose to hold their savings in an inflationary currency, rather than a deflationary one?

The beauty of tipping is that it illustrates how well Bitcoin works for person to person transactions. You can now send somebody money through a frigging internet comment!
Tipping itself, for economic and cultural reasons, I believe will remain fairly niche. What is the motivation for your average person to make the extra effort to tip a writer after content is consumed? People are generally lazy, and not inclined to change their ways, especially to give someone else money. Sure, some communities will be all about it, but it will remain a niche in group thing, sort of like how Reddit Gold is used within the reddit community.
But the concept of bringing transactions to any place comments can be made is genius, and it illustrates how Bitcoin can bring direct transactions to vast numbers of interaction points where they used to be impossible or a pain in the ass.
In the next few years we're going to see a boat load of awesome mutations on change tip that will serve a variety of different purposes.

This is definitely true. This is the only sub I can think of that has a devoted group that is perpetually negative about the sub topic and shows up to hate on bitcoin in every big thread.
The mods should just start banning users who are blatantly anti-Bitcoin. This sub is supposed to be a Bitcoin cirlce jerk, like every other sub is a circle jerk supporting the central topic. Banning people who hate the core topic and fight the sub ethos is standard practice in the majority of subs.

The economics of inflation will solve this problem. Once people realize their fiat is always becoming worth less, while their bitcoin is always becoming worth more, it will be obvious where you should keep your savings.

Barring an unforeseen catastrophe, Bitcoin is going to become a major asset class on par with, and likely exceeding, gold. It is a superior and novel form of monetary technology.
The scenario where these projections come to be is already well underway and gaining momentum every day. His target may actually be low, as it doesn't account for BTC capturing market share from other currencies, stocks, bonds, etc.
@_date: 2014-01-23 12:59:23
Was hoping for similar input when I posted it. I think the whole tone of the article is very conspiratorial. It's not much different than the line of thinking that Bitcoin was secretly created by the NSA. There are some pretty huge assumptions baked into the article that the author just glosses right over, like that somehow Bitcoin leads to a worldwide ban on cash and central banks implementing negative interest rates.

It really is. Maybe I am wrong, and they can kill it, but it creates a prisoner's dilemma scenario, where the only way Bitcoin really gets killed is if the governments of every major country unite to ban it and mercilessly persecute all users.
Unless that happens, the Bitcoin will flow to whichever country decides to allow it, and countries will have a ton to gain economically by doing so.

I think there will definitely be a day of reckoning...governments face some very tough choices. Do they allow Bitcoin to ascend and destroy their ability to control capital flows and crash the value of fiat currencies? Do they make Bitcoin illegal and risk making the situation worse via the Streisand effect? What if they are unable to enforce the ban? What if other powerful states decide to allow Bitcoin after they ban it? Do they try to force everyone over to a state controlled crypto?
There is vast wealth and power at stake and it's going to be thrilling to watch this play out.
@_date: 2015-11-05 14:16:10


It could only happen if the cryptocurrency system being used gave banks special permission to mint new tokens and add them to the ledger every time they made a loan.
Not saying it isn't conceptually possible, but it isn't possible with bitcoin.


Because with fiat, the fact that fractional reserve created money comes "out of thin air" is masked by the fact that this new money is completely indistinguishable from the rest of the money supply. If they tried do it with bitcoin, but did not have the capacity to mint new tokens, then the money they create would have no private keys, would not be on the ledger, and would transparently be an IOU redeemable only at the specific bank that issued it. Currently their IOUs, being identical to the rest of  the money supply, are redeemable anywhere.
So even though average Joe isn't very sophisticated, he would catch on that an IOU from Bankster Corp is dependent on Bankster Corp staying solvent, and therefore is not as good as regular money. Certainly some amount of lending would still occur, but the banking industry's fractional reserve privileges would be significantly reduced.
@_date: 2016-05-09 15:14:24
The real "to the moon" factor is the global strategic asset aspect he mentions right at the end. When governments start competing with each other to obtain bitcoin reserves, that is when we hit 6 figures per coin, maybe 7.
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:25:08


Before now they have never had to compete within their own borders because guns.
Now they have to compete with a categorically superior money technology, that also happens to always become more valuable, as their printed fiat always becomes less valuable.
An easy choice to make for currency holders...
@_date: 2015-03-06 18:48:41


Yea it can. Bitcoin occupies a greater share of the global wealth pie chart, everything else occupies a lesser share. It's simple maths.
Consider the case of gold. More people turn to bitcoin as a store of wealth, less money available for buying gold for that purpose. The same is true for every type of asset.
Fiat and associated treasuries are gonna get 100% wrekt. Hard assets not so much, but they will still be slightly devalued.
Don't get me wrong. Rich people are gonna be fine, but they are gonna be slightly less rich and bitcoin owners are gonna be vastly more rich when this whole thing reaches equilibrium.
@_date: 2015-11-13 23:04:49
That's like, you're opinion MAAANNNN... ;)
@_date: 2015-11-13 20:18:42
If you're holding bitcoin and want to eliminate the risk, you buy options that make money if the price of bitcoin goes down. That way if bitcoin goes down, you make up the loss with money earned from your options that paid out because of the decrease.
The downside is that should bitcoin go up, you miss out on those gains.
More on the concept here: 
@_date: 2015-11-03 20:19:50
Roughly $400 billion, which would put BTC over $20,000.

A lot of them have and will. After they do that they usually stop opposing.
@_date: 2015-11-05 10:17:32
The difference is that it would be 100% obvious that the "out of thin air" BTC isn't real because it isn't on the blockchain. It will have no public or private keys.
That would likely put a hitch in people accepting those IOUs.
With fiat, most people really have no concept that banks can create money, and there is no way to tell the difference between "out of thin air" dollar and regular dollars.
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:49:13


It's very hard for people to make the full conceptual leap and accept that bitcoin is a superior money technology, that will inevitably make current money technology 100% obsolete.
Plus, there's a social element to it. If you say bitcoin is gonna kill the dollar and be worth $1 MM per coin, people think you're crazy.
Yet if you grasp what bitcoin is and understand the basic laws of economics, it appears pretty much inevitable.
@_date: 2015-10-25 13:00:46
I'm totally with you on this. One of the first things that came to mind when I learned about BTC was that it would spawn a massive gambling/predictions ecosystem. It will be much better financially for bettors to wager with an algorithmic house that demands minimal rake.
Just looking at the way DFS is blowing up in the US right now. If that many people are dying to wager, knowing that 10% of their money is taken right off the top, imagine the enthusiasm for a service with only 1-2% rake or less.

Of course they don't. As the crypocurrency asset class rises to it's deserved level of prominence in the global economy, every other type of asset becomes worth marginally less. The wealthiest people have the most to lose, since they own the majority of these assets. It's their wealth that will get sucked into Bitcoin -- making Bitcoin holders richer as they get poorer.
@_date: 2015-03-06 22:01:26
There is a certain amount of capital in the world. This may be increasing or decreasing at any point, but it is finite.
Capital flows back and forth between different assets, depending on where it expects to find the best yield.
Bitcoin is a new asset class. Capital has only just begun to flow towards it. As capital flows into bitcoin, it must flow away from other assets, or else where is it coming from?
So bitcoin rises in value (amount of capital it represents), while other assets decrease in value.

And I agree, this can't and won't last forever.

This is a great question. The biggest individual holder of US debt is...the US Social Security System. 30% is owed to US gov't agencies.
Other major holders are other sovereigns and central banks, including the Fed.
So yea...the majority of the debt is owned by the USG itself, the Fed, and other nations that are running a similar fiat currency scam themselves.

Yes, it is a completely ideological attack, which you can expect to see a lot of in the coming months now that it's clear Bitcoin is gaining popularity. You can recognize this type of attack by the smears against libertarian anarchists and other right leaning political affiliations, appeals for the need of a protective authority to keep everyone safe, and other unsupported claims the Bitcoin is dangerous and evil.
What can I say, some people just hate freedom? Bitcoin means that they, and the people that think like they do, are going to lose power. They are going to use every tactic they can to convince people not to use Bitcoin but it doesn't really matter. Bitcoin is too good. People want it, and it has already passed the point of no return.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:27:36
I don't think we are over exaggerating what is possible. The key difference though, it not what is possible, but what is actually going to happen.
It's hard to imagine right now, because it is going require massive changes all across society. At the same time, it seems like Bitcoin really is a massively disruptive technology. It's kind of a miracle that's made it as far as it has already when you think about it.
Even though people aren't ready for Bitcoin right now, I would posit that they don't have a chance. Bitcoin is happening and you can get on board with it or be pulled along in the aftermath, kicking and screaming. What we are seeing the from media right now and from people with establishment friendly worldviews in just the beginning of the kicking and screaming.

1. Vote with your money. Buy bitcoins.
2. Encourage others to buy bitcoins and help them learn how to manage their bitcoins securely.
3. Educate people about the benefits of the Bitcoin protocol.
4. Use your bitcoins to buy stuff whenever you can but always buy back whatever you spend.
5. Do not engage in panic selling.
6. Actively defend and advocate for Bitcoin in a sensible and considerate way across social media and personal communications.
7. Engage in pro-Bitcoin political discourse.
I don't think Bitcoin will replace other currencies entirely, but it will definitely get its own share of the pie. It is has properties of cash and gold that have never been combined before, so the way it impacts the economy can't be determined.
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:53:14
A million times THIS. The vast majority of Bitcoin haters are aligned ideologically, economically, and politically with the current monetary establishment. If Bitcoin wins they are going to be revealed as frauds and lose a great deal of control over the economy. It will also have the nasty side effect of enriching and empowering all types of right leaning libertarian anarchist types. Of course they hate it! Which is why I love it.
They are going to do everything they can to scare people off Bitcoin, but it's not going to matter. Turns out, only a very small percentage of the populations actually believes their narrative. The rest just grudgingly accepts that they have no say in the matter. But now people have the choice of a currency free of central bank manipulation and we can let the market decide.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:51:47
Hoard for 5-20 years. Cash out when you feel rich. Spend bitcoin when you feel like, but always buy back in the amount that you spent so your stash doesn't get depleted.
@_date: 2013-12-19 12:41:39
I think on the whole, it balances out. Merchants might be selling, but the bitcoins consumers are spending had to come from somewhere. As more and more merchants accept bitcoins, more and more people will buy them for spending. The only way it drives the price down is if the only people who spend bitcoins are the people who are already holding and those people never buy more.
