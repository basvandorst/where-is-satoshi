yeah, i checked it actually, around 200k . but i didn't check the historical figure. is 200k normal?

now i start to understand why we need segwit2x...

i got 2 transaction to that address actually, and both of them are pending confirmations.
obviously i didn't double spend (actually i am now paying to same address twice from 2 different accounts). obviously that't won't be  a problem right?

thx mate, you know what, i have tried that also (and time my clock exactly at 13:00 ish) lol
i learned a lesson again. looks like i need to checkout what's the ideal transaction fee before i submit anything... i never had a problem with 68 sat before.
may be another correction/ big wave is coming, let see.
also, since you mention replace-by-fee, given that my remaining balance is still pending confirm (i used a trezor), i can't replace-by-fee from that wallet right? do i need to subsidy from another wallet?

let me check out how it work. thanks man.
yeah but this is really worrying me, i never have any transaction toke more than 12 hours.
would mind help me to check to see if the transaction looks legit to you?
