Ugh I invested my money into tether! Its OK I'm going long term on them
@_date: 2018-01-11 09:05:00
Nice FUD, to the moon!

Yes my money was rejected from the two big Australian exchanges, POLi and bpay, from two of the big 4 banksm fucked thing is they charged me a $10 rejection fee
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:31:58
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:08:28
Yes, but it takes forever for them to process it
@_date: 2017-12-28 11:39:04
My account is locked, can't access it at all after a POLi payment got reversed, holy fuck this is scary.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:18:49
Great reasoning.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:14:21
You don't. Don't buy stuff on a whim if you don't understand the system. Learn from this mistake and start again.

Why u buying breakfast at 130 in the arvo 
@_date: 2018-03-03 02:46:54
Cool then what
@_date: 2018-03-20 02:17:56
50/50 it happens or it doesn't
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:47:53
There is no correlation between these two, that's that, unless you'd like to show me evidence that they are somehow related (and not just 'oh look this one went down this one went up and people are jumping ship to the other one').
@_date: 2018-03-01 10:32:11
Lol my bad
@_date: 2018-03-01 09:49:49
Can you even open an Australian bank account without being Australian?
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:06:06
No, people don't touch their phone almost 4 times a minute 12 hours a day
@_date: 2018-02-13 10:55:07
This makes zero sense as there's still no reason to use bitcoin over flat for eBay
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:20:17
Australian market 
@_date: 2018-02-02 02:12:44
I own 99% of every crypto and I've been dumping them all
@_date: 2018-02-08 04:09:56
Did you know bitcoins arnt actual physical coins? Wow!
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:19:38
If you give money and receive money back, that's seen as a gain (or loss) and 'must' be reported
@_date: 2018-02-09 03:37:20
What? That didn't make sense. You're new to reddit, so in case you didn't know there are subs where can post sub related topics. This is the Bitcoin sub.
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:53:15
No enjoy your free bit coin
@_date: 2018-02-13 23:17:45
Wow! This is new news!
@_date: 2018-02-26 20:23:48
That's one case, yes, but is also applicable the other way. Hence the average lol.
@_date: 2018-02-26 10:04:07
Look up the definition of average. Just a dumb article not blaming you.
@_date: 2018-02-26 09:31:14
Average implies that there are 50% of people in the world who touch their phone at least 8 times a minute
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:20:48
And why is this on the btc sub? Should I start posting dog photos
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:31:41
If you want 70 cents to your dollar LROS is fine.
@_date: 2018-02-13 22:13:45
Do you thin eBay will use Bitcoin without still taking a cut? They will most likely take a larger cut due to volatility, not to add the BTC transfer fees on top of it.
@_date: 2018-02-23 22:23:00
Yes
