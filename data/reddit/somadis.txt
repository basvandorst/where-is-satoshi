If I have only 1M? I'll diversify.
If I have a million to spare plus some? Hell yeah I'd keep that extra 1M in Btc.

This will drive Bitcoin prices up even more. Buy buy buy.
@_date: 2019-07-12 02:16:25
You guys have no idea how good this is for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-15 04:21:57
Silly zerohedge has zero idea that cryoto market open 24/7 across the world.

check your local gas stations for a btc vending machines. Fees varies between $10 to $20 per transaction. Most gas stations have these now since they provide additional income for the station owners.

He's short of 3 bitcoins to make an even thousand.

This is bad for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:04:50
Damn my bad.

I've been using it quite a bit at places that accept them. Example: Overstock, Newegg, Microsoft, CheapAir when I need to travel or my favorite sport books website like 5dimes.

I'm a 4 percent.

This needs to be upvoted. They will report this on their earning reports which is very good for Bitcoin. Also, it will encourage other merchants to accept bitcoin. Overall very good news.
I just returned a headset I bought with fiat only to buy the same headset with Btc.

Tired of seeing these. Remind me when btc 15k, 25k, 35k and 50k instead.

Listen to this guy and thank him later.
@_date: 2019-07-28 23:03:22
This guy checked out the geo tag from the picture.
@_date: 2019-07-16 17:36:27
Wish he hadn't say that. This is bad for Bitcoin.

It's never a good time to invest in alt coins when main coins such as BTC, BCH, ETH, LTC are still in a bull cycle.

Unplug that computer and treat it with extreme care. Treat it like a winning lottery jackpot ticket. Go on yelp and find thr absolute best PC repair shop in town. Take it there in a antishock case with antistatic materials protecting the computer. Tell them that the computer means a lot to you because of there are notes your grandma, daughter, deceased wife, etc left for up. Make up an emotional story. Tell the IT technician to handle the hard drive with extreme care.

Those are mine.

I also noticed these machines been popping up a bit. My local Exxon gas station recently installed a btc machine that buy/sell btc for a small fee. I was playing around with it and noticed a $10 premium per each transaction. Will post picture the next time I get gas.

My buddy who works for Merril Lynch also said that they're getting into crypto.

Historic charts show that alt coins won't get any friction until the end of Bitcoin bull run cycle. If Bitcoin makes it above 14k then the bull cycle will continued til the end of next year.

Totally voting for Trump if his comment will cause btc to hit 40K.
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:16:27
Just another story about human being bros.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:03:25
its hovering 11k but it will pop soon. Smart money been pouring money into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-30 18:02:48
Maybe it might be a cool time to wear it.
@_date: 2019-09-22 08:26:53
You paid $700 bucks more compared to current market price?
@_date: 2019-09-25 20:17:50
Just pointing out thr obvious. Much cheaper to just wire the money to an exchange and buy it directly for a small ttade fee. Whatever. You guys can continue to throw money away if you wish.
