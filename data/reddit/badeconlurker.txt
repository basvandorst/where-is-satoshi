Even though you expect the ROI to be higher, you can't rely on it. Investments like that are volatile. So maybe over 10 years it will make 8%, but right now it might be down, and you need to make your loan payments.
This is different than an investment when you have money to lose. Once your base needs are covered, you can a take loans to finance big investments, especially if you are a business. In these cases if you fail, you lose your extra money or your business. In the student loan case if you fail, they come for your paycheck, or your house, or your car.

Thats slightly better. Just to be clear, you shouldn't use borrowed money to buy personal financial assets.

You just told me you're using your student loan debt to buy bitcoin. If you happen to be wealthy enough that you can cover your losses at anytime, feel free to ignore my comment.

This is stupid whether or not you are confident in bitcoin. All investments, including bitcoin is for money you can afford to lose. You can't afford to lose that money. Sell of a sizeable chunk and pay that down.

As it should. This is stupid. An index fund is considered a safe and well diversified investment, but you would have to be an idiot to take on debt to buyy an index fund. Buy bitcoin with extra money, not your student loan.
