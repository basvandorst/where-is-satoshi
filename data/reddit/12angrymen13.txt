Also companies like Worldpay don't give true Interchange. I've come across a few of their statements and each one had inflated interchange rates. It's because they have the ability to manage their billing matrix based on how the card is qualified (swiped, keyed, AVS included etc). 
Interchange plus assessments is considered "true wholesale cost to processes transactions" so the best type of merchant account is Interchange Plus pricing where the plus is a small markup from the provider. 
There's far more to it (Especially with Level III involved which is B2B) but that's the gist of it.

Ah, gotcha. That makes sense then. I try and stay away from bitcoin with my merchants. :)

I initially was talking about how I don't recommend bitcoin as an additional option for my merchants when taking credit cards. I sell merchant services and POS software.

Normal payment methods have taken on a huge revamp this year in response to all of the breaches. Basically the U.S. is catching up with the rest of the world in a few areas. About damn time in my opinion.

I didn't realize Canton was referring solely to BC chargebacks. I work in merchant services and a V/MC/DSQ or AMEX transaction can always be disputed and have a chargeback occur on any transaction.

There is no standard interchange fee. There are hundreds of interchange categories. Regulated debit @ 0.05% + $0.21 for example is an interchange category.

A merchant can get next day funding with any payment processor. High risk merchants typically have a 1 day hold on deposits though.

Most of the systems I sell have the ability to accept bitcoin but the backend platforms to board the accounts aren't ready yet. Similar to how some boarding platforms aren't ready for EMV yet but they're working on it. It'll probably be a standard after the next Intechange meeting or at least by October this year.

It's not possible to have no charges when processing payments. I work in merchant services and if a company says they only get charge interchange then they're lying plain and simple. Also "not possible to have a chargeback" is complete BS even if their swipes has peer to peer encryption. I believe Canton was being sarcastic.

Makes sense to me, but my clients are people who accept CC's and DC's. That's what I do for a living. I don't talk to them about bitcoin or how to accept it through their systems unless they specifically request it which is rare.

I posted this in response to /UlyssesSKrunk.
In terms of accepting bitcoin through a POS or terminal it's not really faster. It's cheaper yes but that doesn't mean my clients still won't accept credit/debit cards. I try and stay away from digital currency all together just as a rule of thumb. Especially after the hack that lost $5mln worth of bitcoin a few weeks ago.
As for safety I network all of my clients systems on a private network and when a POS is put in the card readers have peer-to-peer encryption so the card is fully encrypted by the device versus software. So even in the event that they are vulnerable to a breach it's literally impossible for any sniffer to capture card data so they are fully PCI compliant. Plus my clients all get EMV terminals which is as secure as you can get with any payment through a terminal.

That makes sense, I've never really delved into bitcoin. I'll stick to selling MS's and POS's without digital currency.

On this subreddit, yes :)

I was looking for a merchant services subreddit. Saw this one as a suggestion so I dove in head first. I'm not the guy who wrote to Canton though.
