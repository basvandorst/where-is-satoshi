Except you fucking shill, if drugs were to be legalized, everyone would demand that it be REGULATED. In washingon, colorado, etc, marijuana is regulated. 
I want all drugs LEGALIZED and REGULATED. I would like to know that there are some standards and safety in the drug being sold. 
Not a fan of the "government", but don't blame them when the real problem is the inherent shady nature of the bitcoin ecosystem and GREED. 
The only reason mtgox didn't happen in the US is BECAUSE OF THE REGULATION YOU DUMB FUCK. The sooner bitcoin is rid of parasites like you, karpeles, etc, the better it will be.

Listen, you are either very naive or completely brainwashed. Large players have no vested interested in the bitcoin community. They only care about one thing. MONEY. That's the point of bitcoin. They want the bitcoins to trade at a high enough price with enough volume so that they can dump their bitcoins for a profit. 
Nobody in bitcoin universe, ESPECIALLY on the big players, has a cause greater than money. But maybe I'm just skeptical...

Bitcoin is a cryptocurrency being used as a means of speculation right now. Just like tulips were flowers used for speculation or houses were used for speculation. Like all speculation, the few will benefit immensely and the many will lose. It's simple as that. 
Will bitcoin ever be THE digital cryptocurrency? Maybe. But when its price jumps a thousand fold in one year then drops in half, that's not a currency that can be taken seriously.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:33:01

It's essentially short-selling. You "borrow" 750000 bitcoins from your customers and sell them for $100 each. You still owe 750000 bitcoins to your customers so you have to buy 750000 bitcoins from the market eventually. If the price rises to $1000, you in deep shit because now you have to pay 10X more to make your customers whole. He probably thought the price would drop and he could buy on the cheap.

mt.gox along with nearly every exchange has "pulled one over us". Fucking idiot. Are you this retarded?


It's not a lie moron. And even if my bank loses your money, you are protected by FDIC up to a limit. 
The thing about worthless garbage like you is that you are religious zealots. Ignore the mountain of flaws and just focus on the "positive".

What does that have to do with anything? If you went to and said that you didn't believe the nonsense in the bible and that people who believed in it were morons, you'd get downvoted also. Just because I'm downvoted by SHILLS like you on doesn't have any bearing on anything. Just like getting downvoted in doesn't mean that the universe is 6000 years old.

What good does that do you dumb cockroach? I could bury my cash or gold or anything and keep it "safe"? Are you this retarded? Isn't ONE of the selling points of bitcoins that it can be used online? Do you know what bitcoins are? A fucking cryptoCURRENCY? It's supposed to be a means of transaction, not a fucking store of wealth hidden in your backyard. Dumb shit. Garbage like you is what is wrong with bitcoins. Just worthless shills desperate to scam others into making you rich. Instead of truly supporting a cryptoCURRENCY.

What is disconcerting is that we do not know what happened. Mark karpeles along with others could have conspired to steal the bitcoins. That's half a BILLION dollars worth of bitcoins. It could have been hacked and stolen. mtgox might still have it somewhere. Nobody knows.


The problem with bitcoin is that it is in the hand of get-quick-rich scam artists. All the evangelists are scum desperately trying to pump the price to dump it.

@_date: 2014-02-27 14:36:31
That's the cultish nature of bitcoin produced by unadulterated greed. If you lost money, you obviously didn't pray hard enough. If a priests rapes a little child, you blame the child and hide the crime to protect the church. 
This is why we know that bitcoin is nothing but speculation right now. The shills are desperate to hide, shout down or cover up any bad news. If LARRY SUMMERS says anything remotely positive about bitcoin, it gets to the frontpage. If someone says he lost money on mtgox, they get blamed. 
The shills want the price of bitcoin to go up so they can dump their bitcoins for cash. In 2006, if you said that housing prices don't always double every year, they'd yell at you for being "jealous". Nobody wants to hear common sense when they are trying to bleed money out of something...

It's good news. Everything is good news for bitcoins.
On a serious note, it's actually good news for karpeles. This bankruptcy legally protects him and his personal assets from any liability. Meaning that if karpeles personally has a million bitcoins, mtgox users can't sue karpeles to get their bitcoins back. 
Well played...

@_date: 2014-02-28 15:53:49
It's because the trash would rather sweep this under the rug and have it go away rather than answer difficult questions that may affect the bitcoin price. Nobody here is genuinely interested in bitcoins. They are only interested in making a quick-buck off of bitcoins. 


The problem is that we don't know what happened. There is no independent investigation. No records released. No nothing. We just have to take the word of one guy. Hell madoff should've refused the SEC access to his documents and just said all the money was stolen by hackers and saved himself a prison sentence. But karpeles is a more clever jew than madoff.
The biggest problem with bitcoin is that the powers-that-be ( bitcoin foundation, the evangelists, etc ) are all friends and/or business associates and in obvious collusion to some extent. What that extent is, we don't know. But it's obvious the "insiders" are working together and protecting each other in order to protect their vested interests in bitcoin.

Jesus christ the desperate idiocy on is insane. Bankruptcy protection exists to protect THE OWNERS from those they owe.

Yes I envy that someone could magically predict the low and magically predict the high and sell it at those exact times. Because people are so good at picking lows and highs you dumb fuck. Not that I could do much trading given how mediocre the volume is...
I don't envy the people with their accounts frozen on mtgox. I don't envy the exorbitant fees, "bid/spread" rape along with arbitrage theft you morons are experiencing. But you are not clever enough to understand what that means. 
And of course you didn't buy at 400 and sell at 600. But I'm sure "know" someone who did. Keep the pump alive, fucking shill.
@_date: 2014-03-02 01:45:21


Absolutely. He could covered his short through his bitcoin commissions. Though as you pointed out, it would've taken longer and depended on a consistent and stable commission. 
But people who play the short-sell game are expecting a drop in price. It's much more lucrative. Imagine if the price drop to $1. He could've bought back for $750K what he sold for $75 million.

My skepticism senses are tingling.


Explains why you are a shil...


@_date: 2014-02-26 17:01:39
Just like during the financial crisis. Guys everything is fine, then bankruptcies galore. 
But hey, andreas populouus says his halfday audit of coinbase shows that everything is fine...
But I'm skeptical...
@_date: 2014-03-02 18:01:03
Or tulips. How many tulips for an iphone. Tulips would solve all of these security issues. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:42:22
Google btc-e scam. There have been many "issues" with btc-e. But the shills here quickly cover it up and try to hide it.
@_date: 2014-02-28 19:57:56
Keep the pump alive! Shill...
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:55:39


Cause you, just like the winklevii, hope to make a lot of money off of bitcoins. That's just pure greed talking...
@_date: 2014-03-02 17:41:52


I don't understand morons like you. This guy is a multi-millionaire. He lives the high life in one of the nicest neighborhood in tokyo. He still has tons of bitcoins. What's there to feel sorry for? 
@_date: 2014-02-27 15:41:47
Oh god, the shilliness here is beyond the pale. 
These two money grubbing scum stand to be multi-millionaires if they can get suckers to boost bitcoins price up to a certain level. So stop with the hero-worshipping and the nonsense. They aren't in the charity business moron. They are trying to make as much money as possible for themselves. Just like you and the other shills here. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:09:33
So this is depths to which bitcoin peddlers have sunk to. Using a "criminal" bankster who took down cyprus and robbed many people blind as an advocate for bitcoin? Not to mention the only thing he likes about bitcoins is the money laundering aspect of it...
First larry summers, now this guy. Bitcoin peddlers will sink to any lows to peddle their bullshit...
@_date: 2014-03-02 03:50:01


Stating facts != fallacious arguments. "The earth revolves around the sun" is not a fallacious argument. "Ver is a convicted felon" is not a fallacious argument. IT IS A FACT. You may not like that the earth revolves around the sun. You may not like the fact that ver is a convict felon. Just because you don't like FACTS doesn't magically turn FACTS into fallacious arguments.


Except he put people's lives and property in danger by keeping explosives in his apartment. Drunk driving doesn't hurt anybody either. Until it does.


I didn't say he's willing to commit fraud moron. I said he is willing to break LAWS for MONEY. The guy is as greedy as any bankster. But mot trash like you are greedy little vermin.


What situation?


I am a skeptic moron. You are a slavish groveling moron.

Welcome to bitcoin exchanges...  My search for an acceptable bitcoin exchange continues...

CASH ISN'T a bank either. You dumb fuck.
So stop with your fucking idiotic bullshit.

Pretty disgusting that this hideous jew is allowed to breed.

Here come the scammy "charity" sites. A sucker is born every minute and they all visit @_date: 2014-03-02 17:55:08
Law of averages states that the few early insiders made a killing. Some did okay. And most bitcoin owners are underwater. Look at the volume. It spiked as the price skyrocketed.

Only interested in the CTO position. Awaiting first class ticket to tokyo along with contract. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-02-27 16:31:39
No you don't. You just want people to say how great bitcoin is and you want more suckers to buy bitcoins so that the price goes up and you can get rich. So stop with your nonsense you dumb fuck. Be honest. 
Yes, we are all very jealous of the lucky souls who lost money on mtgox. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 12:57:39
Honestly, this hasty "audit" makes it more likely that coinbase is facing issues. Why push this "bullshit" out so quickly if there is nothing wrong? Reminds me of the housing bubble collapse when all the wall street firms rushed to showing audits "proving" they were all solvent. Then they starting going bankrupt.
How come he doesn't mention the issues with coinbase? The delayed withdrawals, the canceled/delayed transactions, double charges, etc. There obviously are some issues there. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 15:30:35
Don't feel too bad for him. He personally still has hundreds of thousands of bitcoins, tons of cash and an apartment in one of the nicest areas of tokyo. Which is all protected by bankruptcy laws...
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:44:29


Did andreas antopolous perform a hasty half-day audit of their books as well? 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:40:01


Really? Want a cookie?


You are a bonafide genuine retard.

Honestly, are people this insane? It's like hoping that madoff's company can be revived so that you can reinvest in it... 
@_date: 2014-02-26 14:58:48
The fuck am I supposed to be jealous of?
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:31:57


Those weren't insults. Simple observations. I'm done wasting my time with a dumb shill like you. Keep the pump alive...
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:11:45
I did. The ceo of kraken is a scumbag. He is a good friend of karpeles. He worked at mtgox with his good friend roger ver. Roger Ver is the scumbag you see here...
If you want to entrust your money with these scumbags, then go ahead. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 21:18:56
So what's the point? That bitcoin "insiders" are just as evil as banksters? 
Does this make the mtgox situation any better? Is this gonna make the people who lost money feel any better?
 
@_date: 2014-02-28 17:08:47


Because the whole bitcoin community is an incestous farce controlled by a few "insiders". It's more cozier and scammier than bankers. 


Look at how many "I feel sorry for mark" comments are voted to the top. And how many "mtgox customers were retards" comments there are. It makes the bitcoin fanatics look like a joke.
At this point, either mark and a few insiders/scammers stole bitcoins or this was an ongoing issue that mark tried to cover up to buy himself time to fix the issue. But of course when you do that, you dig yourself a bigger hole for yourself, until it all caves in on you. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:58:41
This community doesn't exist to be supportive. This community exists to drum up business for bitcoins. It's an cultish advocacy group. No different that "house flipping" seminars.
@_date: 2014-02-27 01:01:35


Or they will not. How the hell can someone be this naive in this subreddit. Fucking worthless shills.
@_date: 2014-03-02 20:05:55


Hey moron. You are the one spewing your nonsense. I'm just a skeptic. I'm willing to "believe".


Cause I'm a skeptic.
@_date: 2014-02-28 23:39:28
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:47:22
Or if there was some organization that protect naive and ignorant customers from being raped by coinbase's shady business practices. 
Bitcoin is so laughable because they didn't learn from history. At this point, it is a true bubble. Everyone here is just hoping to make money real quick. Nobody is interested in developing bitcoin what it is, a cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:25:37


Right and madoff committed fraud all by himself. Let's see if karpeles falls on the sword or spills some names. There's no doubt in my mind others were involved. But maybe I'm just being skeptical...
@_date: 2014-02-27 14:15:35
Except they buy it from bitstamp for cheap and sell it to their customers for a markup. 
Check the current coinbase and bitstamp prices. Coinbase's will be higher because they arbitrage and steal from their customers.
Of course, if you mention that to the sheeple, they'll defend coinbase raping them out of their money. Lot of stupid money chasing here.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:21:19
Are you joking. Mt.Gox was "audited" and deemed safe by what nutjobs tell me is one of the most trusted bitcoin evangelists.
 
I've been searching for trustworthy exchanges for a while. Still haven't found one. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 13:53:06
I'm not the one you should be asking that question to. If I were, I'd be boosting bitcoin like everyone else. Bitcoin always goes up kids, remember that so that I can dump mine on you bag holders.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:49:24
private equity? wall street? you think we should've had a leveraged buyout?
@_date: 2014-02-26 16:03:03


Really? How come no one questions coinbases "algorithm" that selectively marks certain transactions as "high risk" and lets others through? Well people do question it, but immediately get shouted down with "it's better to be safe than sorry" bullshit. 
When you question anything about bitcoin, the bitcoin fanatics either attack you or just tell you to "trust" the powers that be. 
Wouldn't surprise me if some of the insiders are colluding together either. But I'm always skeptical...
@_date: 2014-02-26 15:52:05


That's not true. Companies could just bid for mt.gox's trading data, customer data or even just the domain. Or mt.gox could declare bankruptcy and then be bought. 
But of course, all this could be bullshit. It's mindboggling how shady the bitcoin eco-sphere is given how bitcoin fanatics love to tout the openness and transparency. But that's all talk when your money is on the line. Fucking greedy hypocrites.
