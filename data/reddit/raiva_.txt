There is a sentence I always repeat:
"We are all good traders when looking at the past".
It's unfair to say his decision was wrong. He made profit from it, without knowing if btc price would skyrocket or collapse to zero.
Making money while the future is uncertain is hard. That's why become rich in financial industry is not as easy as many people think.

I'm sorry for your loss OP.
I work in financial industry. There is a sentence I always say that can be translated as "we are all good traders when looking to the past".
It's too easy to "become rich" when we already know what assets or investments were the best bets for the last years. But find them while the future is uncertain is the reason why becoming rich isn't easy in financial markets. Even if we can correctly pick the winners, we are not sure we have them in hand, and we are not sure about what price to pay, neither when to sell.
When I first invested in BTC I knew it would make some good money. I sold for enough money to buy a not-so-new car, but if I hold it up to now, would have enough for a really nice house. Do I blame myself? No, because I didn't know it few years ago.
Take care OP, we are with you.

Yes, in Venezuela they do.

Probably banks will not be replaced by bitcoin, but bitcoin will change many aspects of bank activities.  
  
Another relevant aspect is that banks aren't necessary for loan markets, but the same way we don't need cars to cross cities or countries, could go on foot.
