@_date: 2015-06-30 09:04:37
Ok, wait.
Argument goes;
* user pays and lone merchant can't detect double spent offered within seconds to miners so we can't depend on zero-conf.
* Peter destroys zero-conf and makes it trivial for user to double-spend to himself 5 minutes after leaving the store.
* Now if merchant has a huge amount of connections, it can detect **that** and triple spent it.
Do you see the logical fallacy in that?  If your argument is that the merchant can't detect a double spent your point 3 is impossible.
If merchant can see a double spent, then the current zero-conf is fine and no change is needed.
Pick one! And leave zero-conf the way it is now...
@_date: 2015-06-06 16:29:23
Exactly. And we only need those companies a little while. My guess is at most 5 years.
The sole purpose of these companies is to convert your fiat holdings to bitcoin. When bitcoin is mainstream you will hopefully stop receiving your income in fiat. Which renders companies like Circle obsolete.

Please remember two things;

* The actual increase of real-life block-sizes will not happen for at least a year or so. Probably more like 3.
And naturally, as he mentioned in the article, bloom lookup means you don't actually upload your block. Just a tiny fragment of it.

op is completely correct, though. It is a fix; he never said its done. But we are still several years away from the actual increase of the block anyway.
IBLT means you only send a very small amount of data to claim your win of the block.
Next to this, the premise of the article is wrong. The orphan rate only is an issue when the competition has a better upstream.  And with most of them using the same software, this is not true. They have the same problem.

I guess you would not be affected much, you make people wait. In a store this would not be possible.


Secure is an interesting statement to use; VISA is not secure either.  You must be a technical guy and not the business person :)
A business person would ask what the risk is of using zero-conf. And the answer to that is not black/white.  You can make zero-conf very low risk with a little investment. And **that** really is the relevant question to ask.

Questions the gizmodo article raises;
* Australian? What about the timestamps of emails making him sleep at night in London. Australia has a 12 hour time-difference. He had to sleep all days (or not at all).
* Outlook account?  Satoshis emails were well formatted and followed internet standards.  Both practically impossible to do for extended periods using outlook.
* How is a tech site able to claim spoofing an email address (which any proper email client can do, no technical knowledge required) as "most persuasive evidence"...  
He used a reply-to field, to make sure replies don't actually go to the 'from'. It was just a prank, guys!
* "running bitcoin since 2009" is interpreted like he runs a company. That just shows these people don't even understand what it is. Nobody has been "running" the project since 2009. Not one person. Various.
In my opinion he is a scapegoat that big interests want to use to kill bitcoins credibility by attacking the man behind it.

I did. It used to be GPL, which is Free software. Now its MIT which is open source and allows the contributions to be integrated with a closed source project. For instance when it gets sold. 
This means that the company can stop releasing open source software and just close it up. For a million dollars, the founders can blog all they want. 
The bottom line is that they went from a licence that is the most used open source licence in use and went to one that allows the highest bidder to own all the volunteer contributions.
After that, will you take their word for it?
@_date: 2015-06-30 12:22:26
How do you get your transaction to that miner when all the nodes reject any double spent? Remember you always sent to the nearest node, not to all miners. 
The only answer is directly to a miner you know is not following the reject after first seen. That makes it a very low probability of success since that one miner actually has to get the next block to be successful,  
Don't argue about provability or having security. It just shows you don't understand distributed networks. Here things are measured in risks and probability.
The probability of gaining money from a double spent is very low. That is the proper thing to measure. 
@_date: 2015-06-06 21:29:51
Ehm, in the fiat world if the bank has an insecure system and you loose money (bad atm, bad internet login system,etc) then the result as long as they can get away with it will be that the bank will blame you. And make you pay.
Unless its a major breach, you have to trust the bank to do security well. 
As a developer in the banking system, I can tell you they don't deserve that trust.

The dollar has just been reused as a name whenever it collapsed and they reinvented something new in its place.
It is a serious change in concept and currency when one is backed by gold and another is backed by only the word of the government. That was changed in 1978.

@_date: 2015-06-19 10:45:37
Notice the word **many** in my original statement...
@_date: 2015-06-30 11:54:26
that won't help you triple spent it. It might be mined.
More to the point; any transaction will propagate over the entire network in much less time than you are in the store.  If you manage to double-spent, this has to be done in the first seconds otherwise all miners already saw the first one. And any new transactions that instead direct the money to yourself will be rejected.
@_date: 2015-06-30 09:18:24


Zero-confirmation in nodes now is most definitely a lock. Any double spent send to the same node will be rejected.  So ask a bigger company to validate your zero-conf so anyone trying to sneak a double spent in to a miner will be noticed. And thrown out of the store.
We can add a neighborhood watch. The bitpays of this world. its also not perfect, but the oversight will stop you from trying an infinite number of times unchecked.
Throwing away the lock because you are too un-imaginative to make it work is hurting everyone else. Stop hurting bitcoin!
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:52:42
The replace by fee patch is now more important according to this article. But that patch will make double spend a huge problem and effectively kill unconfirmed transactions. Which kills Bitcoin usage to pay for your coffee.

I think you hit the nail on its head. :)
Code is the working product, if you can just copy it you can avoid the research and the fine details are taken care of.
Reimplenting something you yourself didn't write is essentially doing all the research again since you need to take care of all those little details *again* while not being able to just read and copy the existing solution.
Or, in other words, just reading code will only give you the higher level ideas. Not the finer details. 
Copyleft protects against people coming into the world, building on top of smart people's shoulders without any of the new innovations being made available for the rest of the world. 
Copyleft or copyright doesn't protect people doing the same work on their own after getting the smart idea elsewhere. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 08:57:45


You are committing a logical fallacy here; just because it is not provable impossible to avoid a perfect double-spent doesn't lead to zero-conf being useless. Zero-conf is super useful in its current state. Again; it not being perfect doesn't make it useless
On the other hand doing full-replace-by-fee DOES make zero-conf useless.  It brings double spending a zero-conf close to 100% successrate.
Please stop trying to destroy something you don't understand.

@_date: 2015-06-30 09:07:51


The solution then is to have many bitcoin nodes that are not miners but people that are interested in keeping the network healthy.
These nodes validate transactions and the current implementation is that they throw away any double spends.
So if you have more sane nodes than opportunistic miner nodes, you keep the network healthy.
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:22:50
It would be a mistake to look at Bitcoin as a single whole thing. There is a lot of very valuable research expressed as code in there.
From faster crypto to good distributed networking and many other very hard to solve problems.
All of those can now be freely reused by companies that just profit from other peoples work.


It really is not just RMS, there are many GPL loving people in the world. There are also lots examples where companies ruined open source projects (start at growlaw.net). I bet there are a lot more cases where companies just stole the code and never told.
I personally have been asked to do so for my boss. I told him that Mozilla code was not possible to use this way because I think its immoral.
@_date: 2015-06-08 11:41:56
The main reason is that Bitcoin is not one open source implementation. Bitcoin is a protocol, which means its only defined to be a way to communicate and a set of rules on how to interpret what others are sending you.
As such Bitcoin can be said to be governed by a set of laws. And if you change the code, you can do this within the law, or you can end up breaking the law.
For 99.99% of the changes that break the law the request to do it anyway will be a clear NO. For instance the change of the total amount of coins that there will ever be.
For others its not so clear, and it takes a lot of research what is the best way to go forward if a law-change were to be made. A change in Bitcoin that breaks old rules means that people have to be running a new implementation that is educated on the new rules and regulations that make up Bitcoin. So its always hard to do.
The changes that essentially makes old versions not work together with new versions anymore are hard-forks.
@_date: 2015-06-19 10:46:48

It always takes time, this is not strange and Bitcoin is not abnormal in tech.

Just remember that its the old-school banks that take days for transfers to confirm which makes this slow.
Notice that any good exchange will let you buy your coin for $50 dollars and within moments send it to your wallet.
The thing that takes time is happening *before* the price-setting moment. Again, on real exchanges.

This is not realistic. The potential for destruction in our society is immense, the train you get on can explode because someone made a bomb. The potential is certainly there.  Does it undermine your daily life?  It doesn't.


If you read this sub, read the wiki, and generally do your research you will find that this is a made up story with no basis in reality.


It does do so in a very large extend. It builds on the idea that people are inherently selfish and its models are defined such that the most selfish action you can do (what is best for you) is also the thing that is the best for the network.
It doesn't just remove the need for trust, it expects people to do things for their own benefit and it has that balance defined in crypto that you can't break.

Thats one small company doing its internal things.
As soon as you go to a global system, it takes a bit longer.
The average I had is around 5 seconds, which I think is Ok. It certainly is fast enough in stores as VISA takes about the same amount of time. And with Bitcoin you can avoid typing your pin code, so it should be faster in total (assuming NFC).

That's because you misunderstood the basic premise of proof of work.

The amount of work that has to be done to have security stays the same. So if you chunk that work up in smaller chunks you just need more chunks to get to the same amount of work done.

I'm wondering if you read the post at all; nobody was talking about them stealing your details!

With disastrous consequences.  I can't blame a merchant or website for doing it wrong when its soo hard to do it right.
Isn't it much better to avoid having to trust them at all? Bitcoin avoids this problem by just not giving any sensitive data at all.

I'm sorry, saying that the Japanese Goverment is to blame somehow is just a cowardly point of view to take.
Making it sound like some far away government should have taken responsibility while people kept transferring money to the company is just shifting blame from people that really should have known better.
Before the collapse there were hundreds of bad stories about the company and many had already lost money there.  The term "Goxing" was invented long before the latest collapse.
Next to that, what would you expect? Realistically there is not much a government in 2010-2013 could have done. The company didn't really do much a government could have avoided anyway, it was just utterly incompetent and lost everyone's money.

One difference in Linux is that it doesn’t care about extensions. There is an "executable" bit.
The direct effect is that downloads can never be executed without the user manually opening the file properties dialog and making it so.
Contrast that to windows where an image with a funny name can end up executing code...

I think both point 2 and 3 are not required.
The biggest unsolved problem in technology right now is how to reach an equilibrium without central planning.
For instance think of your washing machine and your dishwasher both needing to do their thing after a big party and need to run many washings.
The simple and obvious solution is if the washing machine needs to do 4 washes, it just schedules those and it will be done 8 hours later. This is what will happen without central planning and opportunistic software.
The problem is that this is not fair and useful. A better solution would be to first do one machine, then the other etc.  Which is a PAIN in the butt to automate without central planning. (refer to scheduling policies in operating systems for 20 years or research).
My suggestion is to give all devices a daily allowance, and to increase the price of the water when the backlog grows (demand gets higher). Then if the coffee maker wants to schedule its slot 20 minutes before you get home, it has the most money left (since it didn't do anything all day) and can buy this slot it really wants.

The current way that people detect where payments come from is having loads of nodes with big pipes all around the world. Blockchain.info uses that to show the "relay node" by IP.
The idea thus is to have enough nodes you own be part of the normal network so you can do snooping.
This post seems to lead towards the same idea. If you have enough tor (exit) nodes, you will know roughly where the request originated.
The problem exists because both bitcoin and tor are trustless. You don't need to trust your peers in order to connect to them. So you can easily end up connecting to an evil peer that scans your info and reveals your intent.
The question then is if we can have bitcoin and/or tor use trusted connections.  So you can have some anonymizing servers you connect to who relays your payments for you.
Idea for profitable company;  start a company that has its servers on Sealand which accepts only bitcoin payments and then it forwards them to the bitcoin-network for you.  Add a patch-suggestion to the various bitcoin clients (mobile as well as Qt) to send users actual signed bitcoin payments to your server if they sign up for the service.
You can sell it based on anonymity.

With Switzerland recently removing those, which countries are left?


It reads funny, maybe replace 'none' with 'zero'.


I don't like the statement on Bitcoin here.  Its factually correct, but it misses the bigger picture.
It misses that security of your money in the bank comes at the cost that you no longer own your own money when its deposited in said bank. It misses the cost of insurance which is where the buyouts (2008) and buyins (cyprus 2010) came from which left many bankrupt.
Its a great 0.2 version, needs a lot of work to represent the actual changes between the two.
I think you are making it hard on yourself with the format you chose because many of the changes are so revolutionary that it feels a little like "how is email better than fax" with listing of the 10 reasons people fax. Bitcoin is *not* a drop-in-replacement for bank accounts.
I understand the push to show bitcoin this way. But maybe you can limit the amount of relatively similar qualities and list some qualities that only Bitcoin has at all.

Which is why it was preceded with "IMOHO".


I have the strong believe that a large percentage of people on are actually here *because* they feel Bitcoin has a very good chance to become a widely adopted alternative monetary system. So your assumption that people will wait until it is one, as well as your assumption that people won't join until that time, those are both not as black/white as you may think.
Next to that; 90% of the world population is "unbanked". An alternate monetary system that allows them to join the rest of the world doesn't need to be sold as unique and different if its their only option.

Actually, the US has the most powerful military because it has control over the world money supply (USD being the world-currency), which indeed gives them power. You skipped the most important step ;)
They control the world money supply because back then (around WW1) it seemed like a good idea. And nothing really better popped up since then.
Bitcoin is the first alternative monetary system *ever* to the kings coin or the US Fiat that moves the power that the US-government holds out of their hands into the hands of the individual.
It is for sure not a perfect alternative, but its quite exciting that it has so far been shot at, poked and burned but its still going strong.
Bitcoin may just be the weapon that makes the military powerless. Because the weapon (=bitcoin) gets its power from all people all over the world.

In my own humble opinion, this is the wrong question.  Bitcoin is not an investment, its a alternative monetary system.  So the question should be when you start converting your current assets from the USD/debt based system to the new one that is Bitcoin.
If you phrase it like this the question becomes one of risk. Which system will have the most value in the end (and thus your assets) and how do you grow your assets held in Bitcoin in a responsible way so you minimize risk.  In other words; how much bitcoin to buy and when to buy this.
I personally take a percentage of my paycheck and convert it to Bitcoin every time.
I expect that I will never sell them back to FIAT, because I expect Bitcoin to one day be so big that I can spend them for services etc.
Bottom line is that this is about risk, your personal risk and how much you can afford to loose.  The FIAT situation is currently stable, but in 2008 and 2010 we saw that change very quickly. So keeping in FIAT is a risk as well.

Thats fine, keep being a consumer.  Use the stuff that corporate America wants you to buy, and work every day to be able to pay for that privilege.  If it makes you happy, go for it!  Bitcoin is not for you.
If, on the other hand, you at one point realize that your income is worth less than it was 5 years ago even though you did get a raise every year.  And you realize that being a consumer means you don't actually have a say in anything relevant in this world. When that moment hits you, then think back about this thread.

Make some digital photos of your apartment *before* you move in. Focus on known defects (hole in the wall etc). Zip them up into one file.
Then take a hash of that file in the format of a public address and transfer a tiny amount of money to this address.
You will now have a timestamped and un-forgable transaction for this specific hash value.
So if when you move out and they say the hole wasn't there, show the photo and if they try to claim you only made the picture that week, you can proof that you had this zip file in your possession by pointing to the blockchain website that shows the address being used at the date you moved in.
ps. not sure if there are better tricks, you will make the money you transfer there unspendable using my trick.

What people seem to forget is that we moved past the point where the marketers are the geeks.  This is significant since geeks are too freaking honest. They will point out the flaws in their product any time, even if nobody cares.
With real marketing behind Bitcoin all this is irrelevant. Cripple Bitcoin for 2 days and tell people that this is a learning experience, they **will** except it. VISA and others have had this kind of problems many times, and its still being used.
Unlike geeks, the majority market doesn't care if Bitcoin is "down" for some time. It happens all the time in the banking industry.  They don't even do any work outside of business hours!

Yes it can. And it will.
You are completely correct that the currently "banked" part of the world has a very low incentive to use Bitcoin.  Apart from geeks and people that want to change the world, there is no really any huge benefit of using bitcoin over your cards. (although on the internet, it has advantages even today)
Where you are making a mistake is thinking that the size of the economic power counts. Sure, the consuming USA is a huge chunk. But the unbanked have no other options, when they start using Bitcoin they suddenly can be part of society.  Similarly, when people working in the US or in other rich countries stop paying 5%-25% to banks for sending their money to their homecountries, this will have a significant influence on the global society.
Bitcoin is a catalyst. Its an enabling technology. Its not all that interesting for the people that already have power because they will not see much change for their day-to-day.
Where it is important is that it takes a very large set of people that were a minority, that were getting poorer, and making the playing field leveled out a lot more.
This is the law of unintended consequences.  Like the internet wasn't interesting to big companies with lots of advertisement budget, until it started allowing the little startups to get a mass audience with little to no investment.

First, to be clear, the patient himself put up the photos.
The actual bitcoin transaction being visible is nothing new, most people don't seem to realize how much information is being exposed in credit-card transactions! Due to chargebacks your dentist needs your information so they can find you later as a small example.
Bitcoin may expose this transaction, but in reality this is not a lot of information.  If the dentist uses a proper merchant app then its really hard for others to find out which addresses belong to that merchant. Remember, a new address is used for each transaction!
The claim that just knowing the price means you know the person and the treatment makes no sense, really.

That sounds unlikely. The one thing we are sure of is that they had the highest bid for a single block, for all of the blocks.

That is a silly statistic that confuses a lot of people. :)
It essentially takes into account the cost of operating Bitcoin. Since its run by individuals and not a company the data is all open and out there.
Compare this to payment in FIAT.  Lets look at the operating costs there. This implies using printed money and coins or credit cards.  All of which only run when there are lots of people involved. At banks, printer etc. The cost of paying all the people working at banks comes from somewhere. Its part of the operating costs.
The cost of paying all of those expensive buildings that are owned by banks comes from somewhere as well, right?  Add all this up and you get the operational costs of FIAT.
 
Those two you have to compare. The cost of those are essentially called inflation in both FIAT and Bitcoin. Bitcoin has an entirely predictable inflation which is listed on the webpage you linked.
FIAT has a very hard to understand inflation model and the generally published inflation by central banks is a lie, they use a model that is much more optimistic than the reality.  If we use the inflation model that they used in the 1980s for FIAT, the real value is above 10%.
Bottom line is that Bitcoin is a completely separate monetary system. With independent inflation.

First lesson in technology;
stop selecting a solution before you formulated the problem.
Your suggestion to use Blockchain is like combining a jet-engine with a playground.  There is no overlap, there is no logical connection as soon as you learn enough and there are some huge downsides to doing this.

Their official reddit sub is; Personally I still haven't managed to wrap my head around what it is...
edit; let me share my struggles;
governance based on locality makes a lot of sense for very obvious reasons.  I follow the exact same laws like everyone in my town because the resources we use are the same. I follow the same laws so I can assume that my neighbor has the same values as I. For instance I don't like slavery or sex-with-animals, and I don't want to live in a neighborhood where this is practiced. Half because it goes against my values, half because I don't want the risk of these things happening to me or my loved ones.
The BitNation Governance 2.0 says people can voluntary opt into their concepts.  But thats irrelevant if they can't opt out of the one based on locality. And if they managed to somehow opt out of it, they would end up being outcasts in their territory.
This is very very basic concepts, and I don't have the impression this is addressed by BitNation at all.  If its not, then it can't work. Unless they found a new *geography based* location for all the BitNation people to gather and be outcasts together...

If I make a payment with my client I send that payment to the bitcoin network.  The useful info is to find out who send it initially, so you have some idea where (s)he is from.
So for instance if my payment is first picked up by a node blockchain.info owns in Germany, before it was seen by any of its other nodes, then they can state that it was a German that made the payment.
Problem is if I use tor to send out my payments.  If I make it in Germany, it may reach the Bitcoin network from a node in Iceland. Screwing up the detection concept.
Having a huge tor exit node may cause more traffic that would otherwise exit in Iceland instead exit on Mike's connection. So he knows it was made via TOR.

There are various decisions that Ms made which makes win less secure for average usage.
As such it's architecture and prioritizing ease of use over security. But it's the whole environment around windows that makes it problematic. 
For instance if a user wants to download a movie, on Linux installing a bit torrent client is easy and secure. Its provided by your distro. On Windows most people will download an exe and run that.
Running downloaded code is a definite no-no security wise. Yet you can't get very far on Windows without it.

That wasn't your usecase we started this subthread with;


I agree that it would be best to ban any NY resident from becoming a customer at your exchange.  You should be safe at that point.  Naturally, the point remains. NY can demand all they want from a Chinese exchange, but the exchange still has no obligation to follow any laws other than the ones in their own jurisdiction. When you become a customer somewhere you typically sign a contract and almost always it states which jurisdiction and applicable law will be used.
If you use amazon, for any of its services, you will see this specifically written at [their site]( Refer to both the "APPLICABLE LAW" and "DISPUTES" sections.


In the EU that law certainly exists. Privacy is taken very seriously. I looked it up for one country a while back and the lawyer told me that if a store leaks private information the owner can go to jail for up to 6 years!

Your pun is fun but misses the point that this post makes. I thought the topic mentioned this, but it seems you managed to miss it anyway.
The point here is that with credit-card payments you, as a customer, give a merchant your secret information that can be used to get money from your account.  If that info falls into the wrong hands, they can also take money from your account.
The security needed to keep this info secure is anything but trivial, and this article just demonstrates that its just plain hard. Especially with official sounding advice that just is plain wrong.
Compare that to your doctor; everyone knows who to go to for real doctor advice. A doctor..  Try finding a real security firm that has diplomas on the wall and is willing to spend an hour or so fixing your webstore...
And to state the obvious; in a bitcoin transaction no secrets are being exchanged.  Merchants you did business with before can not get another payment from you in any way possible. Both are different from credit-card payments.

I think this question is mixing up cause and effect.
"The USD crisis" as a term won't really happen in the current economy. There is too much at stake and people and governments will do any trick to make it work.
What I think will happen is that Bitcoin will grow up enough for people that are by then sick and tired of the world-currencies devaluating and they will try to move their assets over to Bitcoin.
People using Bitcoin will be safe from the inflation techniques that the central banks are pulling, since Bitcoin has its inflation rate completely decoupled from other currencies.
If enough people move their money over to Bitcoin (and I'm talking a significant percentage of the population) then eventually all the tricks that the central banks are pulling in order to safe the USD hit those that are still using USD harder and harder. Because a smaller amount of people have to work hard to pay for the debt.
This is a cycle that will accelerate people moving assets to things that are not debt based. Which is Gold, Silver and Bitcoin.
This process may go on for a while causing steady inflation of the USD based currencies.  It can also be a flash-crash like a balloon popping. I don't know.
Either way, if the USD is going down it will mostly be *because* Bitcoin is mature.

Have a pension by having a savings account.
This is not about a get-rich-quick idea, its about the current economic model that is killing the idea of a savings account.  So, my story starts more than a decade ago where I wanted to make sure I would have a pension by having a savings account.  It took me a while to realize that it wasn't happening. Inflation has been rising (to some calculations to 10%) that the ever decreasing interest payouts mean I loose money by just having it sitting in the bank.
I know why this happens, and in short I want the power to be moved back to the people. So I can save up for a pension. Like my grandparents told me to do. Because it worked for them.

Downloading binaries from the Internet should make anyone feel like they are potentially breaking all security on their box. You really should try to avoid it as good as you can.
In Windows its really quite hard to avoid due to Windows still being the only operating system that doesn't have a download and/or application manager system. As a result the best advice for your coins is to stop using Windows on the machine you store your coins on.
If you really must use Windows, use cold storage instead and buy a ipad or linux laptop to do more serious Bitcoin work.

I agree, that comparison doesn't make sense.  But nobody is talking about "security storing sensitive user data".
This thread is about the fact that in order to make a credit-card payment you give the merchant your credit-card number. Which is not "user data" but you are right that it is sensitive.
Using bitcoin, there is absolutely no sensitive data that needs to be sent to the merchant in order to complete a payment or sale.
So, if you wish, the point made here is that bitcoin payments are inherently more secure because you no longer need to trust that the merchant knows how to do secure payments.

This is at best a really bad explanation, but it more likely shows he doesn't really know the technical details.
Then the next part directly after that where he assumes the cost-price of an ASIC is about 50% of what its being sold for, assuming that the company makes the rest in pure profit, thats incredibly delusional.  Clothing stores and HiFi stores make that kind of profit, sure.  But thats established technology.
If you read blogs from people like raspherry pie you'll see that you can't even get a Chinese Chip firm to do a run of a 1000 devices. The minimum order number is a 100.000 pieces.  Otherwise the run will be a net-loss. With overheads that low, and needing that many devices just to get even, the jump to 50%-is-profit seems at best uninformed.

I think it's in the right direction. Political it's a big step to do this. Technically it's already much closer to Bitcoin than the rest of the world.

There are plenty of people that are interested in Bitcoin and have a full node. Many companies included. Many also have no interest in going to the USA. So how does NY doing something destroy the whole worlds bitcoin network?
Or, in other words, you seem to assume that the state of NY can control the rest of the world. Which is so obviously false that its painful.

This giving away of small wallets is great! Its a fun way to introduce people.
The bills idea makes little sense to me, though.  The only way they actually have value is if you know the private key. So if you give the bill away, you can pass on the private key. But you can't proof you no longer know the private key. An idea is copied, not destroyed.
So for gifts this makes sense, but the bills idea misses the core, defining concept of bitcoin which is that you don't have to trust anyone.

I use them, I think the lifetime of a computer is not that great and recovery options are typically just not there. People forget to backup (I do too) until its too late.
Anyone that has more than one whole bitcoin in a wallet.dat is trusting that those computers will just keep going, and that ransomware doesn't exist etc etc.
Also most people don't seem to realize how predictable we, as human beings, are.  If I have your computer with all your emails and I have your encrypted wallet, I believe a lot of people become easy to brute-force by using their own sent-mail box and private documents as a dictionary.
What I personally miss is a better way to professionally print them. The javascript one is fantastic, but cumbersome.  Ideally an app like LibreOffice has a 2-sided document of A3 size that fits 3 or 4 paper wallets. 
A small python (or whatever they use) plugin in libreoffice could be responsible for generating the actual keys and QR codes, it should be well reviewed and naturally work completely offline.

Its not that simple. Youtube is profiting with adverstisements from other peoples content. If there is an actual direct payment being made for viewing other peoples content, those people will want to get payed for their content. They avoid this currently by allowing you to skip after 3 seconds.


they are already being sold, for much more. Typically on something like the app-store.  You don't need micro-payments for this. Normal payments (using bitcoin) is enough, and bitcoin already can revolutionize this by being a magnitude cheaper.


I'm personally not convinced by these examples. It would certainly not impress any investors ;)  Your numbers are also quite a bit off; there are not a several billion people on the internet...
If you want to use regular payments (say, a dollar), you still gain a huge amount and the amount of actual usecases we already see every day (like your digital goods example) suddenly work perfectly.
I don't see the need to wrangle Bitcoin to support something that really is a fringe market, at best.

Its different since the bank is the 3rd party you have to trust. If you get your paycheck, would it not be nice if the money just went from the bitcoin wallet on the computer of your boss to the bitcoin wallet that you have on your computer? 
Without any need to have an account at a bank.
For instance if you move to another country you first need to open a bank account in order to get payed. Opening a bank account typically takes a lot of effort and legal hoops to jump through.


I've made many many more than 50 transactions without ever having had a scam over the years. So how is this worth it?
Insurance typically is asking you to pay a very small amount. Like $100 a year, to insure your entire house from burning down.  Check your insurances and compare your periodic payments related to the damages that can be payed out. Then notice that you pay 10 to 100 times more for your credit card.
Credit card companies also don't have the ability to cancel your "insurance".


You are right, does that change the validity of his argument?
The point of Bitcoin is that you can keep 100% of your money in your own possession. No need to trust a Gox, a bank etc.


You are wrong, thats exactly what it means.  How do you think it works when you sign up for a subscription and they just charge you again a year later? They will claim it was opt-out, naturally.


I would agree with that. And I don't see any downsides to this.

Neither do the often cited problems with Bitcoin which is computer security in general.
Bitcoin allows you to become your own bank, but that implies you have a large amount of value stored on your computer. And we have seen the many Windows virus' and general computer security implications of that is an issue.
Those are not bitcoin related, but they are very important for Bitcoin.
Naturally, a really secure storage of day-to-day funds can't really be stored like Op implies.

That belief is sweet, but wrong. You are ignoring history if you believe that. Faces have been put on coins and banknotes in order to make clear who owns them. Typically the queen or a president.
Using faces on Fiat is part of the centralized ethos, it gives more power to those few who already have so much power that they can back a currency.  It is, in essence, completely missing the point of the distributed currency.

Some thoughts;
* a device that offers to forward offline transactions should be able to do a lot of checking. So it can find out if one of the inputs is empty (probably due to an earlier transaction not yet having been confirmed, or even offered to the network). So it can hold on to that transaction and only offer it to the network at a later time.
* if an offline device sends a transaction over bluetooth (or direct-wifi) it has to be a 2-way communication (TCP sends acks) and as such it should be easy enough for the point-of-sale to give an initial "looking-good" or "double-spend" answer to the offline-device.
* two offline devices means you have zero opportunities to check if the address the other party is paying you with actually has funds. So trust is moved to be 100% about the individual you look at being a) honest b) technically smart enough to not fuck up.
* A wallet should be able to not use change-addresses if there is no way to get feedback from the network.
@_date: 2014-10-13 08:45:50
Bitcoin is not software, it is a protocol. Like English is used to communicate between people, The bitcoin protocol is used to communicate between the players on the bitcoin network.
As such the trust needed to **hold** bitcoin is very low. The trust you need is in an entire network and an entire businessmodel spanning hundreds of companies and a million individuals all agreeing to not screw people like you over. The larger the amount of people using this, the harder it becomes for this large group to do something that hurts the individual since it needs majority consensus.
This answer is different from which software you choose to run to actually access the Bitcoin network. You would need to trust the individuals that programmed that specific software. But I got the impression that this was not your question :)

After registration you can take anonymous payments and just have to keep bookkeeping and pay your taxes at the end of the year.

This is a misrepresentation of a big chunk of peoples opinions.
The argument is not to choose between writing everything in bits on one side and everything in correct SI (µBtc/mBtc) on the other.
The idea instead is to avoid staring blindly at bits and avoid us having a thread (like we had a couple of days ago) where $25 was expressed in bits (= 100-thousand range).
It is about embracing both.
You use bits because you (and many others) think micro is weird and hard to write.  I'm on Linux; its alt-m-u to get µ. Pretty trivial. I know Windows is not so easy.  So, by all means keep using bits. Just be acutely aware of the fact that one bit is one µBTC.
The flexibility that I and others are calling for is that you *also* use milli-BTC. Get used to it, I know the Americans and Brits have a hell of a time with their units and prefer stones and miles. Pounds and inches.
But, really, milli is not hard. Get used to it. It makes it easier to work with the rest of the world.
In short;
Prefer 12.34 mBtc over 12340 bits.
Prefer 12 bits over 0.012 mBtc.

This is a really weird sentence since democracy lives in a completely independent continuum that goes from dictatorship via communism to democratic. They are means of government (consensus building). Whereas capitalistic is a word that applies to an economic system.
Its the traditional apples vs oranges.
For what its worth; you are right that Bitcoin is not democratic. But thats where your logic stops being correct.
The actual system that cryptocurrencies (and Bitcoin is one) follow is not entirely classified, I think it comes closest to [Meritocracy]( This means that owning more "land" or more mining power or more coins is irrelevant. You can't sway public opinion with that. You can change the rules if your idea is better than the existing ones and the majority of the people agree with that.
This is a much more fair system because you immediately block opportunistic changes that benefit a minority since the majority will not use something that makes them lose power or money.
This is the purest form of creating a healthy community where you choose the system that benefits you. And as such the system that benefits the most people will be the most used (but certainly not the only) system.

This way of thinking is irresponsible and fails you in the end.
Bitcoin is designed in a way that it works with, not against, peoples greed. So there is no requirement for altruistic behavior for it to thrive. Competition is accepted and even encouraged.
The end result is a system where you benefit most by adhering to the system, by working inside the system. This automatically makes the amount of people abusing the system go down dramatically since their interests are better served by following it instead.
See, this is the mistake that people make when they are altruistic, they expect others to do it too. And this opens up room for abuse.

You seem to be having some problems understanding the concepts.
First of all; the Bitcoin blockchain is the only place where value lies. I mean this in a very direct as well as an indirect way.
Use the old story of the Yap ([more here](


Bitcoins never move, they just change ownership. Which is registered in the blockchain and everyone can look at this as a public ledger.
As such you don't actually carry around any bitcoins, all you do is carry around a key. A key that allows you to prove you are the owner of bitcoins.
So your idea that there is a 3rd party processor is a bit weird, since you and your neighbor and everyone else is part of the community that you call a "3rd party". Something that is public doesn't quality as "3rd party" in my mind...
For instance, if you have something of value you want to trade for food at a market place. You just exchange the goods and there is no 3rd party.   But you could just steal the goods and run away. But you don't since at a market place you would not get very far.  So in fact there is a community protecting that transfer of ownership just as much as in bitcoin. You don't call that a 3rd party, but you certainly feel better when they are around (in a public area).
Bitcoin is exactly the same, just better.
Most importantly, you don't have to trust anyone in order to facilitate the transfer.

I'm a little confused by this question; I think the reverse has to be asked.  Why is it Ok, or even wanted, for any money transfers to be done via a centralized entity?
I mean, imagine me going to the store and buying a couple of things and then instead of me giving the owner his payment as a pile of dollars there is someone in between that accepts my stack of paper, takes of a couple and turns and gives it to the store-owner.
If you saw that, would you not question why that guy was there in the middle? Can't we do without that guy?  Can we use money, without it costing money?
This is the situation today, in order to get payed by my boss, or to pay a store-owner, this goes via a bank. Which costs (more than just money).
Now bitcoin comes along and says you can do direct payments, no bank required.
In order to use money for everyday things, banks have changed our world to make all these transactions cost money. In yearly fees, in transaction fees, in chargebacks and naturally in inflation.
Why is it a good thing to stop using banks for day-to-day usage of money? You really need to ask?
@_date: 2014-08-10 09:33:31


Truncating is actually relevant here.
Your theory fails on two points; usernames on bitcointalk are required to be unique. A username on your personal machine is not. The effect is that you will have a lot of users of this software register the exact same hash for their machines. (A lot of users have their homedir called "C:\users\alex" or somesuch)
The second point ties into this with the truncation; a sha1 hash is 320 bits. If you only send the first 32 you will hit a LOT more duplicates for different content.
So, many users will have the same full-hash, while they are different people. Truncating this makes even more people have the same short-hash for different usernames too.
All in all, you may try to do matching like you suggested, but the result is that you will get a lot of installations give false positives on matching.  So if you do a brute force, you will get very inaccurate results.
The company is correct in saying that this is semi-anonymous.

In my opinion the whole exercise of the publication and comment period is just to add fear uncertainty and doubt to the general publics perception of Bitcoin. 
The banking industry can loose all their leverage should the common man start to see Bitcoin as a real alternative. Having a proposed law (which in no way means it actually will make it into an actual law) is a great way to scare people to believe that Bitcoin won't make it in the long run.

historically metal was specific; gold or silver. The coin would be worth its printed value if you would melt it down.
The idea that you issue a coin of metal where the metal cost is higher than the represented value in Bitcoin sounds thus a bit weird to me.
Yes, people prefer metal. For historical reasons. For obvious reasons.  None of these reasons apply to Bitcoin, though. So you will end up with a product that will disappoint.

I think the actual discussion on what the change does or doesn't do is not that important.
The important part is that there was a difference of opinion (and has been for a long time) on how to fix it properly. Luke-jr ended up ignoring protests and pushing it through the one channel he controls.

I think you are indeed correct and not missing much.
The whole concept of micro-payment is a bit of a weird dream. Its a dream because the idea goes that if something costs only a fraction of a cent, people are willing to pay it more. Its a dream because computers start doing payments in that case, without human interaction. And the idea goes, if you can't lose more than a couple of dollars a day, then thats Ok.
Where this is a dream is in that people actually don't want to pay for stuff that only costs a fraction of a cent.  Or, more to the point, someone else will offer it for free. Just because.
See, Micropayments are a dream for the elite that already tried all the business plans and thinks they can get more money out of Free stuff.  Micropayments will never lift off. Its not possible to charge for the stuff you want that *should* be free. Because people like to share.
On the other hand, small payments (say, a dollar) most certainly will. Its close already, you buy a game on your phone for about the same...
Payment has always worked for scarcity products. Buying a coffee (scarce because you can only sell that coffee once) for instance. With the cost of payment going down, people can start different services and products that before were not viable.
Think for instance of a delivery service that uses unmanned drones to deliver your pizza or your groceries. 
Instead of using a weekly or monthly buspass, you pay for each fare with your bitcoin wallet via NFC. You also anonymously identify as the same person allowing you frequent usage discounts (which is what a month card does, afterall).
In short, its not *micro* payments, its the small payments you would use cash for now that can be made much cheaper.

Technically true, but in practice its not so simple.
The difference is based on that a centralized system requires a large up-front investment (hardware, maintenance, people, etc) that a single player has to make alone. This disqualifies a huge amount of risky but innovative usecases.
On top of that it disqualifies tinkering because practically all centralized systems are closed. So building on top of it is limited.
Yes, you are technically right you can do it centralized. But the real question is if someone will.  So I guess this thread is about asking the question what you would buy on top of this neat open protocol and community that is called Bitcoin. Specifically aiming at innovation that we'd most likely never see in the centralized, closed-garden, world that rules technology now.

Because of assumptions. Because of risk and because of regulations.
You have looked at the million predictions in the past about the price. We don't know what the price is going to do. It can be $1000 next week, or it can be $100.  We just don't know.
At the same time the Economy is heating up, in a bad way, and there is a real threat of war, some would say we are already there. This brings a lot of risk towards USD based currencies (aka FIAT).
Regulations may change, which may make it much much harder to get Bitcoins.
So, my point was that if you believe that in a year or two most of your liquid assets will be in Bitcoin and you believe that the price is going to go up quite dramatically in 5 years or so, the risks even out (the current loss is a rounding error on a 5 year timespan).
Or in other words; you can buy now, and risk the price going down.
You can buy in 6 months and risk the FIAT price going down. With the same effect.
I'm personally buying every paycheck a little bitcoin, regardless of price.

I would like you to consider that Bitcoin and FIAT follow different monetary systems. Which means that there is a lot more that is different than just price-per-transaction.
I would agree that the discount is not happening, but frankly its not the interesting reason for people to want to use Bitcoin anyway.
The main reason why Bitcoin is so cool is because it is not managed by anyone.  I choose the word "managed" on purpose because FIAT is being managed. The people that run the central banks are pretty smart people and they have been managing the economy for various decades.
Unfortunately the way they have been managing the economy is by removing unstabilities.  If you are a gamer, this is like removing the force-feedback from your controller.
Or more simply, this is like making your car steer perfectly well and no stutters etc at all at any speed.
While this sounds great, it has a huge downside. In your game you dont know when you are being hit, in your car you don't know when the mechanics are at their edge of loosing control.
In the financial world we already *have* lost control several times and instead of slowing down, we sped up.
Long story short, the current economy, starting at the internet bubble of 2001, has spun out of control. I seriously hope it can be fixed.  But I'm more comfortable if our next world currency doesn't allow people to think they can control it. Failing bad companies is Ok in my book. Closing banks that squander our money is Ok in my book.
Bitcoin allows us to take back the control that has been abused and is the reason we now live in crushing debt, most of us anyway.

Ah, but a merchant buying a service as a 3rd party is not really the same thing. This is a voluntary purchase based on quality of service and risk. This is also an open market of products whereas the banks have a virtual monopoly and really don't compete on features.
An open market of service providers based on an open technology has always provided better value-for-money. This is likely to happen for Bitcoin service providers as well.

Great post, and I agree with the general points. There is just one part that I think is a bit short-sighted so I wanted to add some thoughts to it;


The same was said about file-sharing (bittorrent and friends).
There are a lot of useful features that took forever to appear in commercial products (for instance the boxee that auto-downloads shows on bittorrent). This is still minimal today.
But I think we have seen that it would be wrong to conclude its just a toy. This would ignore the million other usages that people found for it. Many of them not commercial in nature.
I would argue that the same goes for Bitcoin. its usecases are certainly not limited to businesses doing something with it. Fiat may make you believe that since you can't do much without a company or bank in the middle. Bitcoins primary innovation is to stop that dependency.

A user that pays a merchant (POS) system will always essentially create a binary-blob of data that contains the payment details and it is cryptographically secured against tampering.
How this binary blob ends up on the Bitcoin network is really not that relevant. If the user himself uses an internet connection, GSM, Wifi or, indeed, bluetooth, doesn't matter.
As such all that needs to be done is that the merchant can provide a way to take the payment as a binary blob of data and then offer that to the Bitcoin network, which the POS system should be connected to anyway.

OP started with the sentence "During a financial crisis".
What do you think will happen with the USD - BTC exchange rate if there is a financial crises? Notice that "Financial crises" is currently equivalent to "USD crisis". History shows that Gold has always had a stable value, just not when measured in Fiat.
I have no reason to believe this will be different for Bitcoin. Do you?
 &gt; Being a currency and a commodity it is subject both to currency risk and market risk, two far more important risk types. 
Actually, this is wrong. You, as the owner of bitcoin, can choose which of the two risks you accept after the fact.   If the exchange rate (currency risk) gets to a point where you really don't want to exchange the coins to USD, then you can decide to accept the market risk instead by not selling (and paying your rent in btc instead).
So these two risks don't compound, they balance each other.


... and market risk. There are many that disagree with your stance that USD is stable. So the short answer is to diversify.
@_date: 2014-07-28 08:39:48
Its an interesting point of view you bring up.
First of all, you are not correct that every time you step across a border, or send or receive money from another country, the authorities want to know.
The governments of those countries may want to know, but they have to also respect your privacy. This is why you don't have to declare all your money in your pocket when you fly. Only from a certain amount upwards. Same with international-transfers, the banks are not allowed to tell just any government based on privacy laws, but if the transfer is over a certain amount they report it.


The same argument has been held about YouTube. It was obviously illegal to share all those copyrighted works, the argument goes.  But the court has stated the site was used for a lot more than illegal sharing.
You'll see this is a common sentiment argued by the courts.  A technology is not going to be made illegal if only a small part of its usage is.
Your point of view is interesting because it skips ahead a couple of steps. Normally a new technology comes in and some companies that depend on the old way start complaining, then the legal and the political arms of the government come in and try to strike a balance.
When you skip those steps you seem to assume that those that want to have all the info about your every move are going to win.  And thats a bit of a sad starting point. You won't win your rights back by assuming those that want that power will win.
As someone from Europe, I don't share your skepticism. I believe over the last decades the amount of power has gone too much towards big players and Bitcoin is a way to make the odds again more equal.

Sorry for the silly question; there was a proposal many months ago to make the bit be the equivalent of a µBTC, just better to pronounce.
Then when tipped me 14000 bits (Thanks!) about a week ago I opened my changetip account. Which shows the value in Bits.
Today I wanted to tip it forward and learned that I couldn't (embarrassing message about not enough funds followed).
A bit, according to change tip, is equal to a satoshi. Or 0.01 µBTC. I learned this after changing the changetip default to show me my money owned amount in µBTC.

Notice that I wrote "attack" in italics since so many seem to forget that just because one pool has 50% the world can end. This is based on a lot of misconceptions and just not true.
Gaining the power doesn't mean you can do the attack.
Starting an attack doesn't have to hurt Bitcoin, it also doesn't have to be successful.
In fact, it very likely will not be done, it will not be successful if done, and even if it was successful it will most likely not cause a big problem in confidence.  So its not "very very likely" its "extremely unlikely"

Bitcoin, like everything else, sets its price based on demand vs supply.
If you go to an exchange and use that to buy you will get a pretty good idea of how this works. Its quite fun, actually :)
Should someone want to buy $10,000 worth of bitcoins, you could end up making the price quite a bit higher. Depending highly on the amount of sellers there are.
Bitcoin currently doesn't have a really high amount of value being bought/sold any single day, so larger amounts of money will indeed cause price-movement
With that background you can realize that there is a lot going on that can move the price.  More people selling, like you indicated, is an obvious one. Bu

To be honest; he has a lot of good points.
The one that Op picked is very relevant still; Bitcoin's biggest advantage is that you don't require a bank that you then need to trust. But that means security becomes your own risk. And people using Windows are not going to get good security (its better every year, but still not as good as Linux was 10 years ago).

It's still a long list. The point of inflation is to measure how much less your money buys you of the same stuff you actually do buy on a regular basis.
That's why you exclude stuff you don't buy every year.
So in my opinion this is a much more honest index of real inflation.
The difference between fiat and Bitcoin is then a simple one. Fiat is controlled by banks that like to make a profit of off you and by Congress that inflates your money to pay for war.
Bitcoin has its inflation hardcoded in for the next 20 years.
It's still a gamble, but I know Bitcoin will never be used against me. 
@_date: 2014-12-05 07:06:06
It is only game changing if you don't understand how Bitcoin, like gold, is non debt based.
See, the reason this makes sense is because with fiat there is inflation and economic laws that makes it useful to exchange your money into gold.
Bitcoin doesn't follow these rules, so this "service" is nothing but a swap betting against gold. Naturally, if Bitcoin value climbs faster and you hold gold, you lose.
Or more important, this company is just trying to buy lots of Bitcoin with gold. I guess they don't think that Bitcoin needs a "game changing" player to win.

This requires not just a technical solution, but also a change in businessmodel. Traditionally your Company B would pay Company A shortly after delivery of the wool.
This changes it to include the time it takes to market and sell the products before A gets its money.
Imagine a company that buys enough wool to last it 6 months, so optimistically it will be 6 months before that stock actually generates enough revenue to pay off the wool.
I'm wondering what the gain is, why is this elaborate system in place?
It just looks like you introduce a debt-based businessmodel on top of a no-depth based currency.

But I never have exactly one item on my bill. The amount of minutes he is working will change, for starters.
Only the generic "inspection" (the yearly one) is free of paying for time.


Yes, you have.
That "middleman" (the merchant processor) is there explicitly to give you good software, to give you security and insurance.  The fees in banks have risen so much that its really easy for that middleman to be cheaper. Remember that banks have a monopoly whereas Bitcoin is an open market. So prices will likely go down over time.
But the real benefits are the lack of chargebacks. The actually modern software (banks software sucks for merchants). The lower price for not having to handle cash etc.
A secondary but equally attractive point is security; if your system never sees a credit-card there is no requirement to hire a security expert to store that kind of info in your system properly and to continuously make sure its safe from hacking. The attractiveness of hacking a system that holds credit-card info is much much higher than hacking a dentist database ;)
On the other side this allows people to pay without having a credit-card or bank account or carrying a lot of cash on their person.

The way to do a double spend is to create a blockchain-fork and try to publish more blocks than the rest of the network does.
So the simple thing to search for is blocks (and a large set of transactions inside that block) you mine but that don't make it onto the main blockchain. As a miner that is part of the pool doing the evil, that should not be too hard.

Bitcoin is young and immature, for sure. When less of the ownership of coins is by speculators and more is by people that actually use it and want to own it, then the value-swings will surely just be a tiny wave on the ocean.
The point of OP holds true, there are many people that need money in their hands. People seem to forget that person-to-person money exchange (think ebay) has always been really common. Using a bundle of cash starts to look like a really bad way to do this.

You have a good point, if it were true. Unfortunately the banks and the FED have been lying to you. The way that inflation has been calculated has changed to make it look like its better, but if you use the calculation method from the 1980 on todays inflation its between 10% and 15%.  So your banks interest (which is going lower and lower) is certainly not making up for that.
The European central bank has started experimenting with negative interest rates; so having money in the bank costs you. They say its good for the economy. Well, sure, but I'd rather not pay banks for saving for my next holiday, thanks.
The point here is that Banks have a monopoly on defining how the economy works. And they are not doing this job all that well. See the recent story about how this has been going on for years;




I doubt that was what he meant; the point is that a single airstrike costs the average American family about $50000. This gets payed by them by printing more money and thus inflating the worth of everyone's money.
This trick doesn't affect bitcoin, so a bitcoin based economy means the government actually has to *have* that money already in order to spend it.
I know this video will make non-libertarians itch; but his points are quite powerful, so please at least look at the research he presents. 




This really is about the bigger picture I wrote about in the 2 points above.
If you were to start using bitcoin, you immediately take control away from the Big Banks. And thats good for economy.
@_date: 2014-11-11 10:57:20
Notice that if thats the case the miner ends up paying himself. And since an actual payment costs nothing there is no difference if the transaction fee is really really high, or zero. Since he pays himself.
Naturally, mining is work. And its based on randomness which means that the miner can't determine when he will create a new block. It may be in 10 minutes, it may be in 10 months.
Its also worth noticing that if a transaction is included in a block and that transaction is not valid (spending money that isn't there, or other breaking of rules) that the block itself will be disqualified by other miners.  Or, in other words, just being a miner doesn't give you freedom to break the Bitcoin rules.
@_date: 2014-10-14 18:39:16
The ownership essentially goes to the miner. Yes.
This makes no sense indeed, as a way to transfer value. That is also not what it will be used for.
Instead it will most typically be used as a notary system. See a previous post on the Bitcoin-daily thread from mine on a usecase; 
So the difference between sending it somewhere random **knowing** you will never be able to retrieve it, and OP_RETURN is that it doesn't loose the value forever and makes the miners happy.
@_date: 2014-12-30 22:17:08
This is not as easy as you make it out to be. 
First of all; your second transaction will be thrown away (not propagated) at any Bitcoin core node. Which is the majority.
So you need to actually submit it to the miners directly and they have to propagate it for you (so an inveritable bloom tree block broadcast doesn't get rejected) 
Secondly; any merchant should use a solution that connects to a significant chunk of the network so it will see double spends and flag those.
@_date: 2014-09-14 21:00:16
They are talking about money that has not been touched by a bank for a while. Due to there being serial numbers you can track how long something goes between reaching a bank.  If you pay at a store it has a high probability of going to a bank soon.
So this is "money we printed" minus "money we see on a regular basis".  The result is money that either is stored in a mattress or just gets passed between individuals or companies that don't use a bank.
no idea as to why.
@_date: 2014-09-06 10:45:36


This is a really good example of what will *not* happen. The delusion that this is actually an economically viable idea is perpetuated by the elite. The delusion, specifically, here is that you somehow can get payed for your time. And are willing to pay others to gain a bit of time.
The movie "In Time (2011)" shows best how this is a dream for the elite, and a nightmare for the rest of us.  If you think that Bitcoin will make the world better by enabling this, you are entirely missing the point of the movement. Or you are an elite :-)

Simple; its a pipe dream to think that one unit will scale for all usages.


You are wrong; ask a real estate broker about the price of a house and they always say things like "its 200k" or "2 million".  The second mentioned because everything in bits is equivalent to "everything in dollars". And thats just not happening because its impractical.
Notice that the argument in this thread is **NOT** about using SI and thus you having to use microBTC instead of bits. Its about you thinking that its Ok to use bits when milli or even whole bitcoins make the amount much easier to read and understand.
Stop telling people (including yourself) its easier to grasp the size when your phone-wallet says 2000000 bits over when it reports you have 2btc.

What "51% issue" do you think that there is?
Most people that ask this kind of question have no clue what the actual issue is. What actually they are talking about.
At the most basic level, what do you think "the 51% issue" makes Bitcoin worse than, for example, Visa, in that regard?
I'll tell you, its always better than Visa.
Even if someone gets 51%, its still better. Even if someone takes over the network with its majority share, its equal to Visa in the trust model.  Its still got speed and other advantages though.

A node that doesn't have incoming connections typically can't be reached to send transactions to. For obvious reasons.

For reference, my node has 52 connections.

Why? Why would your mug need to pay for hot water?
I think you are missing the point of "the internet of things".  Its NOT about putting a price on all things.  Its NOT about managing things that function perfectly fine right now. 
Lets not solve problems that are solved already and need no registration or communication.
As an exercise, think of a usecase. For instance you live in a cooperation. Which means about 5 adult sharing their kitchen etc.
Every time you cook for 5 people, you gain 4 "points". Every time you eat dinner one of the others made you give him/her 1 point.
This guarantees that the person cooking the most gets the most points, the person that only eats but doesn't cook ends up in the negative.
You can bind this to money, or just to imaginary points and tell someone he can't join the dinners anymore if he doesn't cook and get some more points.
This is a silly example where its all people. And people can do this without bitcoins.  Now imagine using this example for managing other kinds of resources. Anything thats scarce, really.

One of the most common complains I hear about Bitcoin being your own bank is that people still want to loan money. The argument goes that an economy as a whole needs banks. Here is a great example where this is possible without banks as a person to person (or company) transaction.
The various companies that got to fund their business this way, as well as being able to pay out in Wine or Chocolate, shows a movement of decentralization.

63% of the younger generation of people in the USA doesn't want to have a credit-card. 
This (large pdf) document is more to the point stating that 28.3% of all Americans is unbanked or underbanked.
I think that Bitcoin has some real benefit for those, and they certainly fall in the category of "average western user".

you have been misinformed.
First, the IRS and other countries tax services do not in fact actively work against Bitcoin.  The IRS rules you refer to specifically are formulated based on old laws. Trying to apply them to Bitcoin. So this "having to write it down" is nothing new, and certainly not a fight against Bitcoin.  Its also Ok to not write anything down unless you make a *profit* on exchange (buy low, sell high) of more than 600 usd.
Normal users will not hit that.
There are lots of indications that many countries around the world are working to invent new laws that are specifically mentioned to make it less cumbersome.

Not sure if you know what "reference code" means. The behavior of Bitcoin is not defined by Bitcoin core.
On top of that, all the concepts are defined in BIPs which are ratified by the wider community of bitcoin vendors.
So if the C++ project (aka bitcoin core) does something different, it will not be the reference code, it will be faulty.
Also notice that most miners and mining pools are not running bitcoin core.

The biggest problem really is not websites and AV etc. Its the best practices that people have learned from Microsoft over the last decades.

The article is a nice start, but the author definitely needs to work on the details. Right now it feels like its written from end to start; from conclusion backwards towards the question.

One point that I am surprised with every single time is how much the bankers manage to do in order to avoid this situation.  Naturally making it worse every single time.
My personal theory is that more and more people will get clued into the situation and the reasons for their buying power decreasing (and their debts skyrocketing). At which point the idea of Bitcoin becomes much easier to sell because it is an actual alternative. A better one than gold...
So, my theory goes, when a relevant but small group of people start using Bitcoin to store their wealth, and naturally using it as much as Bitcoin allows during this growing phase, the pain of lifting up the old system is moved to the rest that doesn't use Bitcoin.  This is due to the inflationary system that is debt based and it requires ever more wealth to be created in order to get an ever smaller return.
So people moving their wealth to Bitcoin will not make the old system happy.
One optimistic scenario is that more and more people will join Bitcoin and leave behind Fiat. Typically at substantial losses, but less so than staying in Fiat would incur.

These issues are in fact exploitable, and have been exploited in the past. Yet banks are still here.
I don't believe Bitcoin can be taken down by a software flaw. The stakes are already too high. People will just fix it and move on.

Bitcoin transfers are not irreversible. You misunderstood. It's best compared to cash where a payment can be reversed by giving it back. Bitcoin is the same.
What Bitcoin has is that it is a person to person transfer. There is no bank or trusted 3rd party involved. As a natural consequence is that you can't tell anyone to cancel your payment. There is no "someone".
Just in case that isn't clear; this is a good thing. Neither party has to trust a bank. Which is where 90% of money related theft originates from. Things like credit card theft can't happen because those crimes are based on trusting the bank.
Notice that Bitcoin does allow you to re-introduce a trusted 3rd party. That one can be given the power to reverse a payment. And much more options are available.

Apologies if I sound condescending. I am a bit frustrated that you have weird ideas that have no basis in theory and that frankly speaking are quite naive.
For instance your scenario. It would only work in the old economy where all the individual steps are hidden from prying eyes. Really; you think that a company can steal all the coins and transfer them to an exchange without everyone knowing about it in a new-york minute? Bitcoin has a *public* ledger!
You still don't seem to understand what a 51% attack is and how it will affect the network of honest miners. But that's understandable since so many here are jumping to conclusions.
The [wiki]( states;


The implications are not listed; here are some.
* Due to the randomness of mining, the only way to be guaranteed to win is to allow for infinite time of mining. As stated in the word "persevere" in the wiki text. The reason for this is that even with 50% of the power, you can easily end up with only a low-percentage number of blocks for a couple of hours, or even a day.  This is your **main** mistake; to think you can start and end a 51% attack in a short amount of time.
* you cut the network in half as soon as you start this attack. Even if you are behind, you continue on your private fork.  This will be noticed quite quickly as its a breach of the protocol.
* Block confirmation times will double, on average, since two competing chains are being created. Quite noticeable for the whole world.
Natural consequences; (not technical, but easy to argue to be inevitable)
* The evil company can only do this once. Once their intentions to hurt bitcoin become evident, they no longer will get customers pointing their mining rigs at them.
* with everyone seeing the attack ongoing, sites and exchanges will require more confirmations.
* the core devs can stop the whole network and maybe even hard-code the blocks from "evil corp" to be ignored in an emergency update.
* miners will know that since their (evil corps) payments are not present on the competing blockchain (loads of orphaned blocks!) that something is really wrong. Chances are pretty good a substantial number of them will either leave or even start to hurt the pools network. Which moves the balance of the hashrate out of the hands of evil corp.
* nobody will want to buy the hardware or the coins from this company that will obviously be slapped with many lawsuits in the next weeks.
* the owners of the company will go to jail for embezzlement and breach of contract.

Ok, example time. And please stop down voting! I'm putting time into explaining things to you! 
Example; you live in a student home with 10 people. There are only 3 fridges. The students get annoyed that shelf space is scarce so they that people can rent half a shelf per day for a low fee. The idea is that if there is enough requests, they buy a 4th fridge.
So the fridges needs their own account and each individual living there has their own as well.
Having 10 payments a day, does that sound economic viable to use credit cards?
A Bitcoin based solution would be free of recurring cost. A credit card based one would cost probably more than the gain in this whole system.

There is a lot of research and academic material answering those questions. It is about open source or free software (FLOSS) and there are mostly positive reports about how the results are good and usable.

At work I got a Windows8.1 machine about 6 months ago.
I feel that the 128Gb SSD that it came with was getting full, so I ran a tool to find out where the space was being used.
To my surprise the Windows directory holds some hidden dirs that collected about 30Gb of data. (essentially a copy of every .msi I have installed).
The reason is a design decision in Windows, which is not really relevant to my post.
The take-away here is that the last 5 years of bitcoin history, one block about every 10 minutes, is smaller than my Windows directory...
Keeping things in perspective helps. :)

A bitcoin transaction takes one or more input addresses and 100% of their value has to be accounted for in the outputs. Or, in other words, you always spent the entire amount stored on an address.

That's why I chose my words carefully and stated that its about cost to the merchant. Saying "Its not their problem anymore" is kind of irrelevant here.
I'll spell it out for you;
If they lose a big percentage of expected income because people feel its unfair, and thus don't offer the payment themselves, then said merchant has incentive to find a different way to get income.
For instance to raise the monthly cost.

You are comparing two completely different things; having having a transparant financial incentive is not the same as having transparant operations.
I think that gigahash has a very clear *financial* incentive. We know what makes them money and we know what would happen with them if bitcoin would loose dramatic value.
What you seem to be thinking is that we should know how the company operates. This is completely different thing, and arguably useless info anyway. Knowledge of their operational thinking does not imply control.
Knowledge of what makes them profitable, on the other hand, makes them predictable.

I think this is a wrong mindset. Nobody is selling weather data. Similarly to how open source people are not selling code. Or OpenStreetmap.org contributors are not selling mapping data.
They incentive is to create a better service for themselves in a way that everyone gets to benefit by working together.
Your whole post is using the old-school, centralized power, concepts. The one thats failed "the people" again and again because cheating is encouraged and end-users getting big contracts to sign so they can't resell the data they themselves collected. And some core players get immensely rich.

The first requires work to do, so an attacker can't just attempt to make the difficulty rise without cost.
The second is easy to trick; fill up blocks with nonsense transactions (cost minimal to free) and the next iteration it will be bigger. Repeat till the network propagation time for the big blocks make Bitcoin unusable. 
So your idea opens an attack surface that need not exist.

First thing to realize is that ghash is *not* one party. There are many many miners that have a mind of their own and have different goals than the pool operators.

All this just because they mark you breaking the law until you can proof you are doing things legally...

There are two common knowledge pieces of information in the hardware industry.
First; expect to make a loss on your first two revisions. This is the learning time. You will make mistakes. You need to gain knowledge.
Secondly software is a part of your product. Make sure you use a platform that is reusable. This is why so much comes out based on android nowadays.
Just like in the phone industry the question of software updates is tricky. Most companies are switching to a model where people pay a yearly fee to be able to receive updates. Software as a service.
I think that's the best way to do this for everyone.
At the end of the day; there are thousands of companies that make hardware products and make a profit. It can be done.

A supercomputer is just a computer, just really fast.
A computer is a general purpose device. Its a little good at everything.
Mining has long since stopped being possible with any type of computers because they build non-general purpose hardware. Which can't do anything generic and doesn't run software as such. Its millions of times faster at that one thing. But its useless for anything else.

The code complexity is not the issue.
The curve is.  If you look at the curve now it is in sync with the worth-of-bitcoin. For obvious reasons since the curve is the inverted of the inflation.  It also makes a prediction on the price based on general acceptance in the real world. Since we are still a year out, this seems on track to me.
So, if you want to change the curve and have a different way of coming to the total of 21-million bitcoins, well, you are 6 years late. Unless you want to ask all the miners to please return the coins they already mined because you think there is a better way to distribute it.

This is maybe not a very good example because a solution as simple as TOR or gnunet etc can already fix that. Just route your data through a layer that sits on top of TCP-IP which anonymizes all your traffic.

Why is the word "even" in there? NSA is the biggest threat to an open internet right now, and its originate in the US. Anyway, the united nations have deemed internet a human right, so I kind of doubt that a government that is even a little bit free can cut off internet to a large group of people without having a hell of a time explaining themselves afterwards.

It's not about trust. It's about risk management.
There is plenty of risk involved with credit cards because they can be reversed weeks later. Similarly Bitcoin double spend has some risk. Just like volatility is a risk.
The merchant will over time learn what risk is worth taking to actually get the benefit of Bitcoin.
Today the double spend risk is orders of magnitude lower than either credit card or volatility risks.

Actually, that sounds like a really bad idea. You **need** to get approval in a known wallet UI from the user to avoid scams.
You may have missed the point that payments with Bitcoin are irreversible. So no possible way to undo. I understand your point of view; you want your app to be **the** app. But for the user it's just another button that has very severe and unexpected consequences. 
You need to look at multi sig.
@_date: 2015-01-03 00:36:30
The thing you are missing is Bitcoin scripts. Any transaction is actually a program with different options and commands.
Channels use this to first pay, say 1 week worth of money to the merchant. But the script makes it special. This gets mined directly and put in a block.
Depending on the script used after a set condition the money becomes available for spending or reverts back from the original sender.
It can't be spent while the channel is open. Thanks to a Bitcoin script rule which is enforced by the network.

Correct me if I'm missing something, but why would the difficulty adjustment be an issue.

This is a red-herring.
Openness and open source is not about every individual upgrading their stuff on their own.  Imagine your car hood was welded shut and you were only able to go to one specific dealer to get your oil topped off and your water checked.
What openness and open source does is keep people honest. Because competition can come in and do it better, cheaper, than you if you don't do your best.  And make no mistake, this is good for the consumer. Whatever Trezor wants you to believe.
Its not about individuals upgrading their device, its about giving them the freedom to do so. It is about creating a community of people that can help out. It is about being able to say you don't like what Trezor is doing and going to another vendor that can give you a better deal.
So, in short, its about avoiding lock-in.
All we, as customers of Trezor, now have to do is make it very clear what we want. BWallet is said to be a bad open source community member. BWallet is said to actually put in a "call home" function.
So let the world know, let them make the informed choice and reward Trezor for being open with your money and word-of-mouth advertisement.

Bitcoin is in the phase where research and development investments far outpace the returns granted right now.  The price of the coin is simple due to low demand and really has nothing to do with the value of the technology.
The value of the technological platform is growing every day, with every merchant accepting it, with every product adding to it and with every line of open source code being written extending it.
But just like any product that is in development, you won't see a return on investment for quite a while. Basically it first has to get "good enough" then it has to become better than the competition etc.
For example; Android was created in 2003. Thats about 11 years of maturing and it is pretty successful now. You likely didn't hear about it *at all* in the first 5 years of its lifetime. I can guarantee it didn't really seem valuable in those 5 years either.

it in fact makes no sense. A "coin" is quite easy to make untraceable.
Compare it to golden nuggets. Naturally if you pass off a nugget its easy to trace it in the blockchain.  But then you can just end up melting 20 nuggets together and giving parts of the result to a set of 3rd parties.  And you have lost the ability to know which nugget was which.
And much more to the point, if you sell me a coin you stole, and I sell it to a 3rd or 4th party, how does it help anyone if a bank (or exchange) comes and says that money is not really money.  You hurt the 4rd party, not the original thief.

A company doesn't have to listen to the loud open source fans.
What typically happens is that a closed-source product enters the market and makes a profit, then slowly volunteer based open source projects mature to the point where the closed source product can't compete anymore and the closed source company puts their product in maintenance mode (low cost) and moves on to the next niche.
The illusion that you can't be successful unless you are open source is misguided and destructive. Its all about supply vs demand. Thats how any market works, Bitcoin is no different.
Trezor didn't have a good business plan, obviously. We thank them for their contribution to the Bitcoin ecosystem, though!

The supply of bitcoin would not stop growing, which was the goal.

HSBC to charge for holding deposits
Martin Arnold, Banking Editor
HSBC has written to other banks to warn it will start charging them for depositing money in currencies of countries that have negative interest rates from this summer.
It is the first UK bank to say publicly that it will start charging for holding deposits, following similar announcements from Swiss, German and Nordic banks. The unusual steps are the result of the European Central Bank’s recent bond-buying programme, which has suppressed interest rates across the region.
“HSBC charges banks for deposits they hold with us in currencies where negative interest rates apply,” the UK-based lender said in a statement on Tuesday. “Banks affected have been notified and we continue to monitor the situation”
The move will affect banks that deposit money with HSBC in euros, Swiss francs, Danish krone and Swedish krona at its UK, German and Hong Kong subsidiaries.
HSBC wrote to the banks that will be affected this week and will introduce the negative interest rates on August 1. It will not affect the deposits of individual or corporate customers.
The change underlines how banks are having to take extraordinary measures to prevent their profit margins being crushed in the low interest rate environment. It was first reported by the Hong Kong Economic Journal.

The only difference, really, is volume. With more trades going on it would feel mostly the same.
Granted; various Bitcoin exchanges would not be up to the task as its a non trivial thing to write.
That said; exchanges and their front end are typically multiple systems from multiple vendors. They require a centralized exchange instead of the Bitcoin way of many. Only the front ends companies get to compete on quality.  
The downside of using a "real" exchange is that there are a shit load of laws that they have to abide by. One of them being closing times. No 24 hours trading allowed.
Those laws are not there for your or my benefit, they are there for the banks (they lobbied for them).

This is a bit black/white. Its very far from reality.
A conference organizer has options, for instance they can de-invite Garza.  The option to continue to support the guy and give his coin a soap box is not one that people are willing to support.
Your (and Eriks) argument is to let it slide somehow. And the majority does not think its Ok.
I think this community has learned that Bitcoin has a tarnished reputation from bad actors. And its not sitting idly by.  People saying that we should lay down arms are missing the point.
Instead talk to the organizer and get him to drop the speaker.

I've been following the [OpenBazaar](discussions about them dropping the copyleft (aGPL) license on their code and instead going to the friendly-for-companies MIT license.
I'm wondering how many people that are developers will make this distinction affect their contribution to a project.
Or, in other words, would you start to contribute your code and time to OB or Bitcoin-Core if you can be sure that your code can't be stolen by companies that then include it in a product you may not be able to use or change, would you contribute? Or would this have no effect on your choice?

Would a full Bitcoin economy help people in Africa more then it would hurt? 
Considering that there is still a large amount of government officials that are taking bribes. Considering that many African countries are in deep debt to the world banks. I'd argue that, yes, the people of Africa will have more benefits than down sides from a pure Bitcoin economy.

There currently is not really any centralization, nobody has any significant piece of the mining pie.

This is a lie.
There is zero chance of a miner running Classic or an old version of Core including a CSV transaction, so what you are saying is that such a miner can't validate a block made by another miner with an invalid CSV transaction included in it.  And they may accidentally build on top of it.
Miners that didn't upgrade thus are **only** at risk of wasting cycles if another miner manages to send them a properly mined block (with the expensive proof-of-work in it) and gets only that miner to build on top of it.
Thats a rather silly since mr Evil miner throws away their block reward in order to hurt another miner just a tiny little bit. For no gain at all.

There is one big problem with all this kind of things; bandwidth doesn't grow in a vacuum.
Most internet companies have several contracts with different speeds. If only 2% of their customers in a certain region buy the fastest option, then guess who will not get budget for the faster routers and connections this year?  In other words; Bandwidth only grows if enough customers pay for it.
If there is only one or two internet service providers in an area, this means that customers may choose to not take the highest speed because its too expensive. Lack of competition makes it so that the prices stay high.   In other words; Competition drives the quality up.
So the whole discussion of being based on predicted bandwidth growth misses the point that bandwidth doesn't grow the same everywhere and it doesn't grow unless we have a demand. Or even create a demand.

A miner actually makes blocks and sends them through the network. For them sending a block to other miners fast is important to get his block approved. Which means that upload speed is very important.
While we were all talking about nodes, you posted a link about a miner.  Not the same thing.

You reason that people will stop running the bitcoin full node if it won't fit on their harddrive anymore?   I'm not sure if you realize, but the entire 6 years blockchain is 50Gb. Whereas we have 3TB harddrives for pretty decent cost right now.  How do you figure that its above current consumer technology?
Anyway, the goal of bigger maximum size is naturally that they get filled by having more people use Bitcoin. Would you think that if we go from ½Mb blocks to, say, 8MB blocks that actually get full that its fair to say we will have at least 10 times the amount of users?
Would more users not have the effect that there will be more people that want to be secure and run a node for their SPV clients?
I'd guess it might even offset the amount of people you lose because they think stuff got too big.

This is the conundrum...
In Bitcoin there is only one party that can vote, so we give them the vote. But what if they don't vote the way that is best for the rest of the ecosystem? :)


Well, Moores law has been steady since 1975, doubling every 2 years.  Thats a hell of a track record. I'm not sure why we should doubt that doubling every 2 years is going to go significantly wrong in the next 20 years.    Next to that, 8MB is the size of one or two photographs on modern digital cameras.  Cnn . com's homepage causes 5Mb to be downloaded.  Really, we are very comfortably able to handle 8MB every 10 minutes.
So even if growth doesn't keep up or even stand still for the next 5 years, is that really an issue?
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:04:31

Hmm, I'm not sure if that answers the question since every single proposal for blocksize increase has that same assurance in them. Only if we completely remove the max size totally is there such a problem.
The difference between the currently released 101 and the proposed 100 is that miners get an additional vote every 3 months.  What is the need for that vote every 3 months, while they already can determine the block size every 10 minutes.
Remember, a miner doesn't have to include any transactions in a block to get their payment.
@_date: 2015-08-02 17:53:59


Naturally, if everyone is attributing your opinion to be biased, you don't write in a new suggestion that your thinking is based on that idea. That would be bad salesmanship.
If you read his replies on the thread, however, you will realize he still is only doing this because he feels the only way forward is Blockstream tech.
Naturally, he wants Bitcoin to succeed. The problem is that he (and all other Blockstream devs) can't seem to accept that simple growth for a couple of years won't kill it.
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:38:27
One downside is that blocksize is not predictable bound to a max.  This means that a miner has to re-evaluate every ~70 days if he needs to buy a bigger internet connection.  This is the best thing with BIP101, it is predictable for miners ;they will know the limits they have to operate in.
Next to that, it may be growing too fast. Times 4 every 70 days is faster than anything else suggested.  Why that number?
@_date: 2015-08-30 16:53:53
I don't know about you, but my understanding of Bitcoin is not that its for rich people or that its a settlement network.  The description Satoshi made is one where its about any type of payments or transfer or property could be on chain.
So your opinion is noted, but its not the reason many of us got interested in Bitcoin for. (see the other bitcoin subs for details)
So, respectfully, I disagree.
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:30:10
Check BIP101.
There will be a period of adjustment after the threshold is met to allow the other miners to upgrade. 
Do you think that the minority will keep mining on the old chain? Their mined coins will be useless after the branch.
You see, bitcoin is not a technical system, it is a system that gets it's value from what people think it is worth. That's why dodgecoin is not worth much.
If you are mining on a system that only has a small amount of people using it, the value goes down.
Nobody wants to get stuck on a dead fork.

I think I see your point, the analogy is a bit contrived and doesn't fit well, but you made your point.

This talks about an event about 100 years in the future.  If you are planning your system based on something that will happen 100 years in the future you are doing everyone a disservice.
I very much doubt that the Bitcoin we know today will still be in operation when we get there. All the individual parts will have been replaced and any ideas for how to make this work now will be irrelevant on technology in 100 yeras.

I don't understand your answer fitting to my question. I didn't talk about a choice, so which choice are you talking about?
Miners jobs is to secure the chain by putting the transactions in time-ordered blocks.  Nothing else. Thats all miners are supposed to do.
Users, developers, merchants have no vote in the way that the blocksize can grow.
My question is; are we creating one group with far more power than the rest of the actors by making the miners do all the voting?
@_date: 2015-08-29 15:08:05
I think this is great. I liked reading it till the last sentence.
What I'd like to see is that Bitcoin gets sold as a currency and store of value. NOT as an investment opportunity.
That won't solve anything and will just cause people to stop using it in 6 months.

I fixed the MB parts.


If you can download 8MB in seconds, which leaves you with little else to do for 10 minutes.
We are not talking about using 90% of the theoretical max, we are talking about using 0.5% of full theoretical speed. Do you think that the effective speed is lower than that?
The most important part for nodes to do is validate and distribute transactions. This costs almost no bandwidth with a transaction being some 250 bytes. An email is 100 times that!
So even a node that takes a minute uploading a new block (it will take seconds, for most anyway) is a good team player.


Hmm, what kind of speeds, in numbers, do you think we need to go over 1MB block size?

@_date: 2015-08-29 22:11:06


What if I told you that miners currently make 0.5% of their income from fees. After the halving that may go to 1%.
This shows that there really is no incentive for miners to include any transactions. The only reason they do it is to hopefully get the price per bitcoin rising by actually validating transactions.
What happens when a miner finds out that they can lower the block size and can generate fees.   Take an example miner that has hardware which will be useless in 6 months, so why not drive the fees up for that time by halving the block size twice, cash in as many fees as he can and sell the coins for fiat.
The system Satoshi made was smart in that anyone trying to cheat the system ended up paying more than he could gain. Thereby keeping everyone honest.
Giving the miners more power, like BIP100 does, makes them able to cheat the system *and* gain from it for practically zero cost.    What do you think people with absolute power will do with it?

The thing is that 1MB every 10 minutes (or even 8MB) is something that you can do on a simple home connection even poor countries have access to.
In other words; we can grow quite a bit faster than bandwidth availability grows because nodes use about 0.25% of the available bandwidth on a normal connection.  We have some catching up to do :)

Actually, miners IPs don't get broadcasted.  Its not in a block.  Companies that show this on their website just connect to many different miners to see who knows about it first and assume it comes from there.


Well, but what if its not?  It currently is not. BIP100 tries to change that.  And I've not yet seen anyone give me an answer why that actually helps anyone but miners.


Good point!
Would miners find it a problem if there is a double spend?  I would say that users and merchants find this a problem, for sure. But why would miners care?

Processing times are a red-herring. Incoming blocks have transactions that are already processed and validated and reside in the memory pool. There will be minimal scaling of processing power as blocks grow.

Its an 8MB **max** block size.  Not an actual size on disk.
8MB is needed to allow growth, hopefully big growth.  It is not used if there is no growth, as such it safe.
8MB is needed to limit unhealthy growth, like spam or bad technology. It doesn't hurt anyone using todays technology (bandwidth/memory/harddrive space if it actually gets full.
Therefore its a good balance against centralization and for growth.

The item I was asking about is not really answered here. Miners *have* a vote every single day. The question is why do they need to have another vote every 3 months that reaches outside of their own influence?
In your spam example; it is in the interest of each and every miner to ignore those and just have a soft limit.  There is no need for the miners to actually vote on a hard max size limit **as well**.
Or am I missing something?

I'm also following this discussion and get the impression there is a big elephant in the room.
The topics being discussed are not the real issue, the real worry lies elsewhere. 
My guess is that it's about different goals of the lightning people and the bitcoin people.

The bitcoin people don't disagree, but want growth to come from both bigger size and LN (and any other solutions).

One miner with 20% of he hashrate can pump full blocks (filled with spam) and you'd have quite a growth curve. For instance you can go from 1MB to 5MB in 13months, assuming that the 80% stays at 400kb blocks.
One miner having 20% can make the rest grow from 1MB to 8MB in 9 months if the rest is at 800kB blocks.
Thats a much more aggressive curve than BIP101. So you didn't calculate this through if you mean the parts I quoted.
ps. I don't think BIP101 is too aggressive.

So, in fact you now conclude that its the other way around as you said previously. It is an attack on the network to send large blocks.  And unlike you said before, it is not an attack to orphan big blocks. Did I follow you now?

Your example of 64mb is still 8 years in the future.
In the 6 years we had how many spam filled blocks? Assuming always full blocks for your calculation is unsubstantiated.
Drives don't need to double every year. We can store totally maxed out blocks with bip101 on a 3TB drive for the next decade. With todays tech.
The drives actually do double every 2 years, but thats irrelevant since we are using just a tiny percentage now.

Bitcoin currently handles about 0.0007% of the world and they send on average about 1 transaction per month.
If this goes up even a little, we'll have 100 times the traffic. And despite LN arguments, that will require a significant growth of the main chain too.
So unless LN is meant to replace Bitcoin, your point is wrong.
Both should grown. 
@_date: 2015-08-29 21:12:16


If it is, then how do you feel that miners being able to vote ever 3 months helps individual users?
Do you somehow think that miners will do what is best for users instead of for themselves?   For instance, a miner might think that 250kb blocks are fine, he still gets his reward. And fees may go up due to shortage.  How is that good for users?


The current proposal says that 21% is enough. Is that low enough?


This is an interesting question. And I feel you forgot to mention the other players in the bitcoin ecosystem. Why only think about miners? What do users and merchants think?  What about that startup that wants to put proof-of-document on chain?
How do they get their voice heard?
 


I'm willing to challenge that assumption.
The fact is that many have argued miners want smaller blocks to have higher fees. This is directly the opposite of what users want.  They want free transactions.  Ever heard the saying that foolishness is to let the fox guard the hen house? Same thing. 


The question that I'd like to ask is why miners will be benevolent and nice to users when they earn more with less users? Do you really want to give miners that power which can make you be unable to get your transactions approved every single 3th month?

Looks like you fell for the party line from Europe. The idea that Greece was the one doing it wrong and most of the blame lies with them.
This is so wrong and sad that it's amazing to me you believe it.
In reality the problem comes from the eurozone applying its German way of living on a completely different culture.
The spending was disconnected from the income and the effect of this was hidden behind so many layers that no greek politician would know they were doing it wrong.
Imagine you getting very cheap loans from your bank for 10 years, then when your income goes down your bank says "don't worry, we fix!" and another 10 years later your bank says you have to give him your house, your firstborn and you will have to pay him everything you make for the rest of your life.

I don't see a prediction of growth, only a limit in BIP101.  What that means is we expect computers to be able to handle this size of blocks at this year.  And bitcoin won't break if we reach that limit.  Thats what the limits are there for.
This doesn't predict bitcoin growth, maybe blocks never fill up over the 100MB size...
People that fear that in 20 years we can't handle 8GB really should look back and learn from history.
A harddrive was about 2GB 19 years ago. Now we can buy ones that are 1000 times larger.  Does that sounds familiar? Thats exactly the growth curve of BIP101.
And we are using only about 1% of a current harddrive, so there is quite a lot of flexibility build in.
Besides that, soft limits and future hardforks can always be applied. 20 years is quite a long time.  I'm 100% certain we'll have more hardforks between now and then.

I think your premise is wrong. Bitcoin services don't need to modify or extend Bitcoin core.
But, lets assume it was gpl. From all the licenses one can choose, GPL is by far the most used. This means that there is a lot of code available for free under that licence that you can copy/paste into your project. That would be useful, no?
This is not the same for all languages, but for C/C++ it certainly is true.

No blame was given, the German people were not talked about (just their way of living), definitely not given blame.

You can't blame Greece for having a certain lifestyle. You can blame the EU for trying to change Greece in a way that everyone that ever worked with both cultures knows will fail.

Say, we have a blocksize of 8MB. Its full, and you get a new on average once every 10 minutes. Are you saying that home users of Bitcoin somehow need an industry grade internet connection to run a node?
Because, you know, 8MB is really not a lot of data... Even the most mundane of internet connections can download that in half a minute. Modern ones take about 1 second or less.
So in order to run a full node you need to download 8MB every 10 minutes... If you go to cnn . com, the front page is 5MB.
Can you explain why you think bandwidth is a problem when the amount of data transmitted every 10 minutes is a tiny fraction of normal web-browsing behavior?

This article is very biased towards old school thinking.
What he is suggesting is that a government stealing money from everyone in that country by means of printing more money is then able to avoid a crisis.  He naturally gives no proof for this, or even historical relevant quotes.
This is because its all made up; you can't solve an issue of lack of income by borrowing more.  This is taught to everyone in their early years.  It will just delay the inevitable that you have to somehow pay back your loan, with interest, and it will cause bigger problems.
What authors like him don't understand is that debt is something to avoid, not embrace.

First; the freedom comes from the ability to choose any provider. Or even to become one.
It doesn't come from having millions to choose from, a couple is enough. 
This is because when you can switch node provider at any time, or become your own, that will keep everyone much more honest. It stops being a monopoly with power at the center.
Second mistake you make is thinking that your choice somehow decides where your money lies. You should never give away your private keys. Ever. Have them locally and choose your peer node from the crowd.

Combined with only a modest rise in price, we won't have to worry about that for at least 10 years.  Next to that, the *current* difficulty will have strong enough security for about 5 years as well. Nobody can come even close to hacking or attacking the amount of hashes we have today.
So, how do you figure there is a dependency on fees soonish?
@_date: 2015-07-18 10:36:06


This is an assumption I don't follow.
The effect I think it will have is that the currency is global, but the interest rates become local.  For instance if a Greek farmer comes to the bank for a loan of 20BTC, he will get a very different loan (terms, interest rate) than a German office worker going to his bank for the same. The reason is simple; the risk of default is very different.

Please explain how you can insure against theft of money by government?
@_date: 2015-07-18 10:15:10
Thats because I didn't attempt to answer your question, I just responded to your premise being wrong. Someone pushing a political agenda may have some points that tries to show Bitcoin in a bad light, but first you need to see if the points show his own ideal in a better light.  In this case, it doesn't because he is not actually putting forward an argument. Just "Do it my way and it will work"...  Why should I believe him? Ordinary people are poorer than ever, rich are richer than every. I would not hire him on that resume.
But, sure, if you want, I can go into Bitcoin further.
Fist, I doubt any country will embrace Bitcoin. It will not happen as it causes too much fear of failure.  But if the majority of the savings of its people are in Bitcoin instead of in the country's own currency the effect is the same.
Bitcoin is not centralized, it takes away the ability of countries to debase the savings of all its people. It takes away the top-down ability to set interest rate (not that banks listen to that anyway).
The main reason countries steal their citizens savings by inflation is because it makes loans that the country made cheaper to repay.
So when your country loses its biggest export, and the income in taxes towards the country goes down, the problem is really not what economists say. They will say its lack of growth.  But you don't need growth to keep feeding your people.  You need growth to allow the interest-on-interest-on-interest of the last 50 years to be re-payed.
People that have their savings in Bitcoin (or houses or gold) don't need the economy to grow because they don't have to suffer the inflation imposed by the government in order for the government to pay back the interest-on-interest.
As such a drop in income from export means that the company needs to fire people, those people will have to find smart new things to do and make money another way.  Everyday life, really.
Tl;dr. Countries say they need constant year-over-year growth to stay alive. This is a lie, they need this growth to keep their **currency** alive. If people use Bitcoin this requirement goes away.

Printing money doesn't work that way. It is means to debase the currency in order to have to pay back less.
Imagine you have a farm and you lend out some fire-wood to your neighbours. In order to pay it back you send your kid to steal some fire wood from everyone in town in the middle of the night.
And you pay back your neighbours with their own wood.
This is what printing money is. And it only works in one direction.
The ECB is printing, greece is loaning. The ecb is the one stealing the wood behind the house of greece.
Saying the problem is that greece can't print more entirely misunderstands the power balance.
Bitcoin makes sure there can not be any debasing (or stealing).
You are right that it could not have saved Greece. But it could have saved the greek people.

You glossed over this part; 


Nobody is saying that debt is bad, the point is that borrowing has to be done responsibly and on an individual basis.
Finland lost its two pillars of income, two export industries stopped being profitable. The proper response is to let them go bankrupt and let citizens start new companies based on good ideas that are going to be profitable.  The bad response is to borrow lots of money to make a bad business continue, hoping paper will sell more again soon.
Cheap loans don't make a company more healthy.  Greece is the prime example of this at a large scale.

Something about the "fee market" just doesn't sit well with me.  So I did some checking and this is what I found;
The fees every block are typically around 100milli-btc. Sometimes double that, many times less.
The block reward is 25BTC currently.
This means that fees currently is 0.4% of the earnings of miners.
How do you create a market out of something that is only 0.4% of your income?  Economy 101 says; sell the same thing to more people as well as making more profit per unit.
You'd have to make the fees 100 times more expensive to even make a dent in the miners income!
A much much more obvious solution is to extract the same low fee from many more customers.  Where a customer is someone sending a bitcoin transaction. Which means that in order to have a fee-market, you have to have bigger blocks first and foremost.
Anyone saying that smaller blocks will create a fee market is advocating pricing Bitcoin out of the market by making fees at minimum 100 times as expensive as they are now.

I suggest watching the videos on "The hidden secrets of money" on youtube for some info on what the sentences you write above mean. I don't think you mean what I think they mean.
A quick start may be this segment; 
 
Some points;
*  in fiat money the inflation has not been due to growing money supply for decades, but instead due to monetary policy.
* all currencies are tied to the USD. Its the world-currency.
* Bitcoin is money, not currency and it has its own inflation model, completely outside of anything else.
So not all markets are linked, instead, all *Fiat* currencies are linked. But importantly; Bitcoin is a separate market (much like gold).


Notice that my statement that Bitcoin price is going down was because of inflation. What may not be obvious to you is that the inflation referred to is Bitcoin inflation. There are more bitcoins entering the market than there is interested people buying. The halving is still a year away.

@_date: 2015-04-21 07:51:52
Bitcoin is not software, it is a protocol. The technology (like sha256) has indeed had a lot of testing and proofing and is known to be good.
There are a handful of implementations, the core software is an important one. But that one doesn't really do much similar to truecrypt.
Seems you mixed up "encryption" (storing of secrets) with crypto based proofs (no secrets, more like a signature). What this means is that if you find a problem in the bitcoin core client, the effect is very minimal. You certainly will not have the ability to steal other peoples Bitcoins.
So to answer; the crypto used by bitcoin is audited. The various implementations use external libraries for crypto, which have been audited.
The core client has not been audited, but the impact of any issues there can not really affect Bitcoin.

One of the big differences is centralized vs decentralized.
Centralized is cheaper, faster and you don't need to care about maintenance.
Decentralized allows freedom to do what *you* want.
When you see it like this, then decentralized will loose every time. Won't it? Freedom is such an abstract thing, and the cost is really really high.
But lets make it more real; centralized is public transport. Its certainly cheaper than owning your own car. Decentralized on the other hand means you have your own car and you have the freedom to take any route you want, or leave at exactly the time you like.
So freedom really does have its advantages; I live in Europe and while you can certainly use public transport, there are plenty of people that own their own car.
Back to Bitcoin. The financial system has been centralized for so long that there has been no need to innovate. Its like we are still driving around in horse-drawn carriages. The end result is that while centralized *can* be cheaper, in finance its not. Also centralized *can* mean faster, but it takes days to do what Bitcoin does in minutes. All due to lack of innovation in finance.
All this doesn't even touch on the subject of monetary policy costing so much that more and more countries slip into poverty. Which Bitcoin can't save us from, but it can avoid it repeating in future.

Good think that he doesn't actually do that. This is a story that seems to have gotten a life of its own. There certainly is no truth to it...
The simple truth of it, and I've read the code, is that there is some code that detects a node being under a very specific type of denial-of-service attack. And it acts on it by prioritizing tor nodes lower than other nodes. So *only* when there is an attack, *and* there is a lot of incoming connections, *and* the attacker and you are both using tor, *and* you happen to be unlucky (1/50 chance, really) you can get disconnected from that node...
To say that is blacklisting is really dishonest. Please find the website where his client is downloadable for the facts.  I can send you the url in a private message if you want.

Actually, no, it is completely in line with the distributed nature of Bitcoin.
The idea of having a global consensus before we can act (which Core now follows) makes no sense. It means any idea that is too new, too crazy and too odd will be killed. That is not what distributed means.
Distributed [whatever] means each node makes up their own mind and makes its own decisions, while not hurting the others, that is.  Thats how nations work, its how your local major has a lot of say in how his town works. This is why you can do whatever you want in the privacy of your own home. etc. This is exactly what distributed ownership is about. It is a very human way of working.
In the end, the ideas that make most sense win. Ideas can be copied for free, and good ones can end up making the whole network stronger.
So someone being able to say he wants to have total say over his own little house is more than Ok. It is exactly what distributed Bitcoin is about.

A couple of points;
* LN won't solve a lot of usecases.  For instance international payments can't really use LN (since no route will be found).  So if you want to have remittances, they will still on on chain.  There are a lot of other payment types (like micro-payments) that will still go on chain.
* The max size is not indicative of the actual size. Actual size is determined by usage. If no transactions are sent more than 10 MB, then the blocks won't get bigger than that.
* The max size is there to protect the network from overuse and abuse. the BIP101 numbers were chosen so that even home users on their broadband and 3 year old computer can handle the blocks. So your argument that 8GB is too much is missing the point that the design was made such that it IS possible. 20 years from now your personal computer will easily handle 8GB.

The miners can activate the BIP101 by mining blocks with those version bits set. They don't use a  plain core release anyway, they can vote for it without the maintainer having merged the patch.
There are various BIPs that we use daily (mostly for the mobile wallet) that have been official bitcoin for a long time, but not supported in BitcoinCore.
It would be a mistake to assume that the BitcoinCore maintainer has say-so over the protocol design.  That would be quite centralized, now wouldn't it?

This shows a misunderstanding of Bitcoin or of the current Visa solution.
If you give your Visa card to a friend and they go to the store, they can pay in your name. In fact, the merchant reads all the information from the card and all that information is *the* secret that allows your friend to make that payment in your name.
So in theory there is nothing holding back the merchant, or your friend, from making another payment a week from now. Even after they returned your card.
Bitcoin is different, you never give away your secret. Its much more like cash that way. Only the person (or phone) that knows the really long private-key can make a payment.
As such, about 99% of all the contested payments suddenly go away.
This is the lie that banks have been telling you: your CC protection is not against your mistakes. Its your protection against their flawed design.
@_date: 2015-04-21 08:05:04

It is true that computer security is in a really really sad state almost everywhere in the world. I think that most people don't realize the importance, and those that do realize it feel incapable on fixing their situation.
The amount of virus' infecting Windows machines is really a good indication of the same problem. Most people life with it, because they just don't have the energy or knowledge to fix the situation.
It is an illusion to think that computer security will improve first, before Bitcoin can take off.
Take as an example mobile phones, they contain an immense amount of personal data and losing that, or getting it hacked, is definitely very painful. Many use their phone as a 2nd factor authentication for bank-logins, for instance.
The security of phones has increased as market demand for it made that a priority. Most phones now have some sort of locking mechanism that doesn't require you to remember a pin code (not easy for many). Innovation in that area continues.
I think we will see a lot of people complain about security and it will improve. As an example and wild guess, I think many will start using Linux for secure computing and Microsoft will invest in security improvements in Windows and Outlook as a result to avoid losing market control.
Similarly, the rise in Bitcoin will cause people to get interested in solutions like hardware wallets.
Thirdly, the "maker movement" (think 3d printers and open source) will be able to provide lots of different solutions which makes sure that a single flaw will only affect a very limited amount of devices.

The IPs for deprioritizing are *not* used unless we are detecting a denial-of-service attack!  So what exactly are you afraid of?
The central server is the Tor server. Listen to the argument!  If you can hack a tor server, and stage an attack using tor, you can make specific nodes have a 1/50 change to get disconnected for half a minute from other nodes.. 
Really? Have you heard of the DNS ddos attacks?  They are much more effective, and much easier to do.  Please do try and hack the tor server that shows all the exit nodes and see how long your hack will last...
Be realistic.
Privacy and anonymity is not a top priority to anyone in the core team. Never has been. Notice how it broadcasts your IP address? Notice how you can receive payments in its wallet on the same address every time? The wallet still doesn't support the HP standards.

Loans at banks in the current economic situation **create** new money. Due to fractional reserve banking. The bank essentially creates new money by taking on your debt (which they then sell as debt-based-bonds).
This is very profitable for banks and bonds holders and it leads them to centralize the concept. Banks buy debt big and sell it for profit to loaners.
There is a lot wrong with this concept. From the unregulated increase in money supply to a top-down risk assessment. The latter is the reason for Greece being in huge trouble since their risk was artificially made the same as the risk of Germans, while in real life this is very far from the truth.
In a Bitcoin economy this concept doesn't work for various reasons.
In the Bitcoin world you likely will end up with a much more honest and direct way of loaning. People actually need to have savings in something like a bank before the bank can loan it out. The bank would likely not take a very big percentage at all, and would not really take on much risk either.
The loans would be much more local; the Greek farmer has a different credit rating compared to the German family working in tech-firms. The money they pay for the privilege of getting a loan will thus be different.
Next to this is that the inflation (for the next 100 years) and later the deflation is hardcoded. Completely predictable and risk-free.
So to figure out what the monthly payments are can be based on risk minus deflation.

Its back to basics, I would welcome some actual research project, but for now its Bitcoiners that are *doing it* and their experience will be the source for everyone in future.
Economy as we know it has always been about debt. We have 5000 years of evidence that all such (fiat) based systems collapse in on themselves. 
The reason is simple; if your central bank creates $100 it does so by loaning it, next year it has to repay $101, so it has to borrow $101 which increases the debt year over year.  While the total value in the economy remains unchanged.
Creating money costs money.
So forget all you know about economics and reason how it would look if your money is debt free. Creating money no longer costs money.
Effect; nothing to repay, no reason to inflate to make it match the GDB, no reason to have a monetary policy at all which we only have to compensate for the flaws in our current currency.
@_date: 2015-03-13 06:48:38


Read between the lines. First of all, sidechains are in a research phase, there is no shippable code for at least a year. So maybe, but probably not, for sure not any time soon.
The article specifically says they will have no private currency, they will use FIAT instead. And as such private mining is impossible. You need block-rewards (creation of money) to have private mining.
So logically, they will sell mining equipment and generally *the* network to central banks and later likely to big banks. And make lots of money.
Naturally, like I wrote in another reply, this has nothing to do with Bitcoin and just sells a minor solution in a political way.
@_date: 2015-03-06 09:10:00
You mean they would stabilize to actually have a stable supply/demand based economy ?
In the current economy an ever increasing economic growth is needed to just have a stable economy. Because of the debt-over-debt based fiat currency. If the output of a country would not grow it makes everyone poorer because so much of the effort goes to paying of debt.
This has lead banks to punish people that don't consume. We now see popular media call people that save money "hoarders". Like its something bad. Ask your grandfather and he will not understand the consumerism people have now.
See when your grandfather was small he learned that putting money in the bank made it grow. Interest was much higher than inflation. And as such 50 years ago people would do exactly the thing you think is a bad thing.
And guess what; people still bought cars and other expensive things!

This reads very very familiar.
In the world of Linux this was the common feeling as well, most distros did as you wrote. Then one came in that started doing things differently. They *marketed* themselves as being very open and their new products would soon be made open source. The never actually did any of that. They also provided exactly the thing that was missing up until that point in the commercial Linux sphere.
This company (canonical) is now one of the largest around, when counting user acceptance, while most open source developers that ever worked with them or their platforms will get a bad taste in their mouth when they are asked about the company and how 'healthy' it behaves in the economy of Open source.
In other words; any company that is professional and can do good marketing and naturally releases a good product will be able to not care about having a healthy Bitcoin network. They can just life off the goodwill of others and ride the waves while giving back only the bare essentials.
Its happened before, as I wrote above, I'm pretty sure it can happen again.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:08:55
This is a bit of a silly question; in Bitcoin all you can do with a 51% attack is to take over control of future transactions. So you have the power to say "no" to certain transactions, or to do double-spends because your 51% nodes can follow different rules.
In the main banking industry this has been happening for years, using politics and using fractional reserve banking.
There is no equivalent in the banking world, because this "attack" is build into the FIAT system. Its a natural property of it. It is the way that the traditional banking system has operated for thousands of years.

This is a myth often repeated by economics that really haven't done any research.
Afterall, in a deflationary economy you are still going to buy food and clothing. The idea that people would stop doing so is not really supported by logic.
It is also not supported by fact, as we have had various times where the economy actually did run deflationary, and none of the predicted negative consequences were observed.
Notice also that Bitcoin most certainly is not deflationary right now. And it won't be for decades to come.

Hmm, why?
Notice that in Europe we currently **have** deflation for companies. The economic leaders are saying it will be good for the economy.
It means I can go to the bank and get a loan and they will pay me interest :P (happened in Denmark, google it)
I've heard a lot of people argue results based on the long history of debt based and inflation based economies.  But the truth is that an economy like Bitcoin proposes (not debt based) when it goes into deflation will not be predictable based on past experiences.
Conclusions like the above thus have to be reasoned through.  So many things change, like the individual loan, that its easy to miss something.
In the end Bitcoin resists monetary policy setting and resists concepts like centralized interest rates, it also makes impossible the concept of expanding the money supply using concepts like Quantitative easing.
The direct effect of this is that companies will have a much more direct feedback loop between supply/demand and earnings. And this will have the effect that a company having a product people want will be able to ask for the money they need.


This is demonstrably false. Especially for a global currency.

The correct answer is still not given, and its the following; currently there is an incentive to NOT have big blocks. This is a bug or a flaw in Bitcoin. Currently if you have a bigger block and someone else has a smaller block and you both find the hash at the same time, the slowdown of sending the big block out will cause the one with the big block to loose all his bitcoin earnings.
This is the reason pools have rejected the 1Mb blocks.
With the Invertible Bloom Lookup Tables implementation that is being developed for the Bitcoin Core client this problem will go away and then it doesn't really matter to a pool how many transactions go into a block. Having more will just mean that they will get more fees payed out.

There is the test net for exactly this reason.


This sentence makes it sound like pushing an upgrade is a one step process, in reality the author tests it on the test network, people review the code and test it some more. It gets committed on the 'master' branch which is run by a sizable set of people and when 3 months of testing shows it works fine, only then its "pushed as an upgrade" in the next release.  After which slowly the rest of the network follows that change.


That would really be a really bad engineering job.
In reality the vast majority of upgrades to the core protocol are done a long long time in advance of the actual change. These upgrades themselves essentially become part of the protocol.  So the protocol will say have a description of behavior before and after a hard-coded block number which is the change we are making.  Where that block-number is likely a minimum of 6 months in the future.

I have no inclination to defend the position that the central banks f*ed up. Instead I'll point to the famous quote from  Henry Ford who predicted that this would fail many many years ago;

This actually makes a lot of sense, for IBM. If you remember, the people that made the most profit from digging for gold were the people selling the shovels...
Central banks are looking for alternatives and for excuses to the people for the money crisis we are in the middle of. They can blame Bitcoin and then in one sentence announce that they will be buying for mucho dinero a better bitcoin from IBM. Imagine, the mainstream media will eat it up!
Banks are so far behind the times that they will actually benefit from a cloud based and crypto based transaction system, which is at the basis of Bitcoin (the boring parts). So it would actually be an improvement, just a tiny little improvement compared to the leap that Bitcoin is, which has the potential to make them completely obsolete.

This forum really is not the place to discuss the quality of those features, the bitcoin core people rejected this specific implementation for very good reasons and you can read the public archives to find out why.
Naturally people can run whatever bitcoin full node they want, thats their right.  If you believe that Bitcoin has been managed well so far, then maybe you want to trust them more and use the Bitcoin Core client that has got us here over a version that the Core people actively rejected.

Its biased because it is saying truths in a way that make it appear they are not true for every single alternative out there.
Its like saying; "dnivi3 is using his browser for porn as well as for reddit, he certainly also uses his browser in the office!".
The truth is that the merchant (vendor) doesn't volunteer his profits to be kind to the purchaser. Instead (s)he just charges the fees to the purchaser in another form. So any claim that Bitcoin does something bad is essentially a biased way of repeating the lie that the Visa's and Mastercards of this world would really like people to believe.
An unbiased person would give both sides equal weight. For instance saying that many Bitcoin merchants lower the sales price to reflect the absence of payment fees.

Why would a slow GetBlockTemplate (which is used to start mining) cause orphan rate?
At worst it would cause the miners to sit still doing nothing for the duration of that call (but cost nothing because they don't burn electricity then either), but slowness in starting to mine has zero effect on block-propagation times after its mined.
True enough, I think you are probably right about this.
I still enjoyed learning how distributed systems are not that easy to maintain as a centralized is. For starters you can't just reboot it.
I do agree with OP that we need bigger blocks, that backlog created would be gone in a day instead of filling up all of the nodes for weeks.

Well written, I've been trying to figure out these details for a while myself and been missing the overall picture you so nicely described.
Have a dollar for your trouble Following your thoughts; loans will have their interest rate set based on risk, which will be more individual based on which country or city people live in based on past performance.
As such you are more certain a German couple will keep paying their installments than a farmer in Greece. So the farmer may get a higher interest rate to cover your cost of them defaulting.
As such Bitcoin is a global currency that is really extremely local and individual.

The word Hoarding became a bad word when the economic growth became so needed that it became addicted to people spending their money as soon as possible. Because with money constantly in movement the bank system earns more. The companies that make stuff sell it faster and as such we can write on paper that there is economic growth.
Naturally, this is not really growth. The output of a nation (wealth creation) doesn't go up. The people don't become more well-off.  Its essentially borrowing growth from the future.
As such those that earn from our spending and loaning (banks mostly) started calling "saving" something that has a negative taste to it. To make people feel like they are doing something bad when they save.

The monetary policy itself isn't the problem. The problem is the disconnect with the fiscal policy.
So the income and subsequent risk of loans is upgraded in Greece to be the same low risk as Germany. Without the country actually having the same income.
The people get their pension earlier. They get more money it and they pay much less taxes. 
This is why the euro failed 
Bitcoin doesn't repeat that mistake.
The monetary policy itself is made impossible with Bitcoin. At this moment you have to remember what the point of this policy was. It was to go against markets and fix things that wasn't good for the economy. Well. That's what they said.
Taking away the ability to have a monetary policy means normal markets can work again. And this was a  successful solution for a thousand years. So arguing that it will break is slightly naive.

The ripple advertisement strategy makes sense for them, all the power to them.
The thing is, they are thinking too small. They are suggesting to upgrade central banks so they work better, while central banks themselves are the reason for our economic problems.
So the only result this will have is a faster decline and more profit for the ones in the center.
Ripple is not the enemy, because it won't appeal to the people. It would be a 'safe' solution, which makes sense now, but with the Euro sliding 30% in 6 months, I bet in a year from now people will not go for something that is essentially the same thing in a different color.

I never used Gox, just various other marketplaces and bitcoin exchanges.  As far as I know all of those place orders in the orderbook anonymously. You, as a trader, can't see who made which order. Especially when a buy collects various orders already on the book, there is really not any way for you to tie those buys to a specific person (or bot).
Even more so on a busy exchange.

Two weeks is not that bad, I think.  You'd have to loose a huge amount of hashing power before its a problem.  If you loose 50%, it only takes twice as much time.  And how likely is it you loose 50% of all hashing power in one day?
Notice that the cycle is not aligned with the halvings of the reward. So Its not 2 weeks after the halving, its much less.

That is kind of big thinking, for sure.
Bitcoin is opening the doors to even bigger thinking, though. The FIAT system is a system we have had for centuries. We have had central banks for centuries as well. And they are based on a system that throughout history has failed again and again and again.
Now, for the first time ever, there is an alternative. A different way of doing money. One that is growing faster than any idea and technology ever before. It can replace all 200 or so central banks by moving their control to the billions of people that actually are affected by the concept of money.

This misunderstands the difficulty concept.
The difficulty is there to provide a feedback loop and thus make things have a consistent return on investment based on how many different parties are mining.  This implies also that mining will NOT take much notice of changes in hardware cost, changes in hardware speed (moore's law) and naturally how much money is thrown at the problem.
This destroys all those theories about a small amount of people doing mining. Because if you have a huge chunk of the hashing power, there is no incentive to turn on more mining hardware. And thus the difficulty goes down. No company will spend money on mining hardware when turning it off will still make most the rewards go to them.
The situation where one group has 95% or even 50% therefore makes no sense. Its an assumption that in the real economy won't happen. That would be equivalent to assuming that in an open market one company can be the only one that ships operating systems to everyone in the world. It will never happen.
@_date: 2015-02-04 11:00:16


That is not an explanation on why the energy consumption is not a problem.
Let me do the math; your indigogo page says your battery has a maximum load of 10mAh. At the optimal 3 volts. This means about 10milli-watt for 3 hours.
The BLE [wikipedia]( page says it operates between 10 and 500 milli-watt. So at the theoretical most positive situation you will have the wallet be able to be listening for 3 hours. In practice this is more likely to be much less.


So, you argue that the phone can be hacked.  Have you considered using application-layer encryption between your app and the wallet?  Would solve the same problem, without this extra step.


Its not about it being required. Thats missing my point. The point that I'm trying to get you to understand is that this is equivalent to a banking website showing your password in a tooltip so you can avoid remembering it. **It completely breaks security.**


As someone that has been working in security, I agree it takes time to understand. I think that my understanding is not really the problem.

Actually, quite a lot.
First of all, practically all of our knowledge of how economics works is based on a system that is inherently different from Bitcoin. The current money system is based on debt. See the excellent series on the hidden secrets of money on YouTube if you don't know what that means (that all our money is based on debt).  Come back afterwards. I'll wait.
Because all government money, and everyone else's money is based on debt this means that the government goes in debt more and more every year. Due to interest upon interest that has to be payed off.  Solution; we inflate money. This is done by printing more money.
What that means is that your $100 in the bank buys you less and less bread every year.
So, economics says you need inflation. They say this *because* the governments and central banks want to manipulate the market to stay healthy. But most of all because they want to pay back with less interest.
Now, Bitcoin is not based on debt. There is no year-over-year interest that you need to pay back just for owning Bitcoins. Its much more like Gold in that way. The idea that inflation is needed for the system to work just doesn't apply in the same way.
Many people, even certified economists, are repeating unproven ideas. Ideas like that people would hoard (i.e. save) money in a place where deflation happens.  This is not just unproven by those economists, its easy to disprove by looking at history. Here is one fast example; 
So if there is one thing that you are getting wrong is that mostly likely you believe that the central banks of the world are required. That their market manipulation is a good thing. That our economy is doing well or at minimum better *because* the central bank policies.
There is ample evidence to back up claims that in fact central banks are the most horrible thing that has happened to this world, it has brought the biggest divide in wealth and power in human history. There are more people earning money now then ever before that do not create anything of use. They just know how to work the system, making the rest of the world poorer.
Bitcoin is one, and in my opinion, the best, alternative to a central banks based monetary system. Its a better money than money.

With "regular money" you may not be talking about what I think is regular money. Last I checked, video game systems didn't accept coins and bills.
So you need to depend on a bank and use something like a credit-card to do it online.
Just because the credit-card company (or the bank) automatically converts from your local currency to the currency that the game wants doesn't mean its not essentially doing the thing you say we should not do...
Bottom line is that this proposal makes a lot of sense if we assume people already own Bitcoin. Especially for people not using USD (since thats what the games tend to use). It makes a lot of sense for those because its less friction payment (faster) and less people taking a percentage.
I would disagree with OP about it being the way to get mass adoption. The way to do that IMOHO is to get people's salaries payed in BTC.

The video is confusing to me on a technical level; maybe you can explain the workflow a bit more.
The user has a phone (P) and your card which is a wallet (W).
The Wallet is the only one that has the private keys and the phone is the only one that is connected to the outside world (internet etc).
When the user wants to pay, they get a QR code and the Phone gets this in the app.
How does the Wallet ever hear about this?
How does the Wallet know when to generate a one-time-password?
Why is the one-time-password needed in this workflow?
The one-time-password entered on the Phone. What does the Phone do then?
Next the user presses the button on the Wallet and the Wallet signs the transaction and sends it to the Phone.
How does the Wallet send anything to the Phone. The video shows a tap-tap. Thats not how NFC works. It requires a slow moving 1-second touch.
So how is the signed transaction send to the Phone?
Please respond and also please let us know who came up with the names of the actors in the video. Names like "Shopping hsiao" which means "shopping plenty" make me think this is a hoax.
@_date: 2015-02-03 18:43:24




Does that mean that the Wallet is always connected to the phone, waiting for a request for payment over bluetooth?  The earpieces that do this run out of power in less than a working day, and they have a much larger battery.






So you are telling me that the Wallet is always connected to the phone, over bluetooth, listening to incoming transactions. Bluetooth is encrypted, peer to peer. After the first pairing you know that the data comes from your coupled device.
Then the idea that you need to type in a code **on the phone** doesn't add anything. All you just did is make sure you use the right Wallet (card) with your phone. The phone can't use that info... All the Phone does is send the password back to the Wallet over an already-know-to-be secure channel to the Wallet to say "I know its you".
But wait; you have the "tap-tap" which sends the one-time-password from the Wallet to the Phone. And as you say it just sends it back to the Wallet. Over the same bluetooth channel (you can't have two devices use more than one bluetooth connection between them). What does that accomplish?
This second-factor-authentication is worse than useless. This is surprising.
The product you demonstrate requires a lot of very highly technical skills. In fact, its too advanced for current day electronics. Having your bluetooth listening to your phone continuously? In a card that is so small I can't see a battery at all?
Also any e-paper controllers I have found are each and everyone seriously bigger than that card. And you manage to put enough CPU power into it to actually sign a transaction?
I'm very skeptical.

Bitcoin is a peer-to-peer system without any single owner and without any single company behind it.
This means that the system is protecting itself from abuse, and your suggestion is most certainly abuse of the system.  The way that it protects itself is that all people include a tiny fee for a transaction. So small that it doesn't matter on day to day basis, but if you are an abuser, it starts to grow.
So, the why not, because its not needed and its a silly use of everyones computer (not just yours) when you do this.
Who decided this? The whole community.  Everyone likes Bitcoin *because* it protects itself from abuse like this (and many others) in the basic rules of the protocol.  So everyone that uses Bitcoin, or mines for Bitcoin supports the fee structure.
