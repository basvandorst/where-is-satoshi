If models work then why didn’t Wall Street see the 08 crash coming? Oh that’s right! Their models were based on the performance of FRAUD! Heehehahaaehhehah
But seriously, this model suggests bitfinex and tether will continue to grow with stability. They will burn to the ground. Get fuckin real

Bitcoin price can’t be inflated?! LMAO
@_date: 2018-06-14 22:06:45
I don’t make price bets in fraud markets.. But your notion that the market manipulation is what’s causing the DIP and denying that it caused the entire bull run of 2017 is the most misleading and uneducated bullshit I’ve ever heard.
@_date: 2018-06-14 23:12:25
No response? Look up what happens when a future position is liquidated. There is even an entire twitter feed devoted to tracking multi million dollar future position liquidations. It only costs an exchange like bitfinex a small percentage of their cash to create the ~5% swing in price needed to liquidate their customers and make MILLIONS

When people see btc/usdt worth $600k on kraken but $6k btc/usd on coinbase... you don’t think that’s gonna cause a panic sell? Lmao
@_date: 2018-06-14 13:39:13
Your a fucking idiot lmao. The exchanges wipe people’s margin future positions with big swings in price, either up or down. Why don’t you google what that means and delete this ridiculous comment
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:49:39
You don’t seem to realize the implications of tether not being backed up. It will not keep it’s peg, meaning the coin will crash to zero.. and take a large majority of crypto down with it.  
Crypto is massively insolvent. The whole system is only one “bank run” equivalent away from entirely failing. Tether will trigger that run. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:34:21
This was not an audit.. making these papers worthless and clearly based upon an entirely different set of standards and procedures as an audit. If the financial investigation was done properly and fully, it would be an audit.... but it’s not, as it states in writing. So there’s your answer
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:13:56
Audits trace cash flows.. which in the case of tether would clearly show that the “reserve” is not a reserve because they move the funds around and trade with them.
I work in commercial credit analysis I’m not in audit but I know enough about financial statement analysis to say this. There’s a reason tether won’t do an audit - it would reveal all of their wrongdoing.
Nice try at the “you’re not even qualified” argument when clearly you are way less educated than I am on the matter.
@_date: 2018-06-13 17:13:24
If you weren’t contributing to mass delusion and financial loss with your brainless rah-rah-rah bitcoin rants then maybe I’d be more in the mood. 
You know absolutely nothing and I feel sorry for the people who think you do.

Lmao no idiot. Spoofing, tape-painting and counterfeiting are illegal in every other market in the world.
@_date: 2018-06-15 00:37:12
Fair enough man best of luck
@_date: 2018-06-21 13:48:42
Audit would prove that the funds are truly held in reserve and not used to pump and dump coins and liquidate customers that trade on margin. Do you know anything?
Look at Enron. They had plenty of these “reports” but would move the funds all around into fraudulent accounts right after the report is completed.

Lmao I see now. I ate the onion didn’t I 
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:16:58
So you don’t think it’s weird that tether promised regular audits and after years of printing over 2 billion tether they still don’t have an audit? Am I conspiracy theorist? Or do I have common fucking sense. Hm....
@_date: 2018-06-14 10:54:09
Heavily edited*
Well you’re right, this isn’t “the reason” markets will be wrecked, it’s just a nasty side effect. But it will happen. Let’s use binance then instead of kraken, my bad.
follow the demand:
1) Faith is lost in tether’s peg - demand for tether is gone. 
2)In order to get rid of tether, one must buy a crypto/usdt pair. Huge demand increase for crypto/usdt pairs. 
3)People want Fiat while tether’s crash destroys the crypto space. They send crypto to USD exchange and sell for USD. Demand for USD way up, demand for crypto/USD pairs way low.
The high demand for crypto/usdt pairs as the only tether off-ramp, will drive their price way up, and the demand to then exit into USD will drive prices for crypto/usd way down.
@_date: 2018-06-21 14:42:17
Why would I trust an audit that isn’t an audit? Didn’t they promise audits in the whitepaper? 
How is that bullshit lmao these guys are clearly crooks. I’m sorry that what you’re so desperately trying not to accept is just an obvious reality at this point. SFYL
@_date: 2018-03-26 03:43:55
Ya Seriously wtf lol
@_date: 2018-03-25 14:31:41
I sold a bit before the ATH after finding out about the obvious bitfinex and tether fraud. I haven’t invested *yet* after the ATH but I certainly plan to after the market is cleansed from all the manipulation and overpowered exchanges. 
Funny I’ll probably get downvotes for this. People only care that fiat is centralized. they don’t care that crypto exchanges have more power over crypto than government has over fiat. Oh the irony
@_date: 2018-03-13 03:28:58
Lmao this got me
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:14:36
100% agree. 
People mistake exchange regulation for crypto regulation. Two different concepts! Exchange regulation ONLY helps the consumer and HURTS the fraudsters. It’s much needed!
@_date: 2018-03-27 23:53:56
? Arbitrage is using the variance in exchange rates to make profit. What does that have anything to do with escrow(ensuring both parties do their part in a trade)??
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:01:26
Monkey see monkey do

With bitfinex and tether fraud in the air, SEC comments about exchange regulations are very far from nothing burgers . Perhaps you should do some more research on the subject
@_date: 2018-03-06 18:29:14
Hahah I Fuckin love that guy
@_date: 2018-03-21 02:42:14
Crypto is going nowhere until these fraudulent exchanges are wiped out and regulated to the bone. They have way too much control cough cough TETHER
@_date: 2018-03-09 23:33:53
I think you missed the point. Bitcoin is not very liquid 
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:54:25
I last looked into third party bitcoin escrows in around November and struggled to find anything too appealing that I would actually use. 
@_date: 2018-03-14 13:51:51
This is not true. Cryptocurrency Exchanges must be regulated, but this has nothing to do with controlling bitcoin. Actually, exchange regulation *prevents* these criminal exchanges from having the amount of control over bitcoin that they do currently.
Please see: Tether &amp; bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-24 17:51:44
Sure bitcoin itself is trustless but until escrow is figured out then making purchases is not even close to trustless. This is a huge barrier right now.
Imagine ecommerce with bitcoin. If you send the payment for a product and the merchant never sends it, what do you do? What can you do? Nothing.
What if I used my credit card? Easy, I call my bank and they force a transaction reversal or they take the loss for me and pay me back. Bitcoin can NOT do this yet and that’s really important 
I love this tech and I’m a big believer but there is a long way to go. Nothing about exchanging bitcoin for a good or service is even remotely close to decentralized trust. People don’t seem to understand this
@_date: 2018-03-12 20:38:28
Wow excellent points. Haven’t thought of it this way before 
Thank you
@_date: 2018-03-07 19:34:07
I’m sure both played a part. I didn’t write the article 
@_date: 2018-03-17 02:37:40
I take fraud seriously. You don’t? Lol good luck
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:09:13
I’ll explain a little bit into what would happen if tether is exposed. 
Btc/usdt would skyrocket as everyone flees from tether to btc. At the same time, everyone would be trying to trade USDT for USD. This will break the peg and cause tether price to crash...
Right now btc/usd is 10k and btc/usdt is 10k. If tether crashes to 10 cents right now, btc/usd is still 10k, but Btc/usdt is 100k (basic math).
This disparity would be massive cause for concern for obvious reasons and would cause panic sells back to fiat. Btc/usdt would soar,  but usdt would be worth nothing so it doesn’t matter - btc/usd would crash due to panic. 
It’s just important to think through the difference between btc/usdt and btc/usd. If the peg ever breaks, it would be a shit show. 
I hope this helps! I tried to keep it simple 
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:26:32
Hijacking domains and social media handles to convince the masses that an alt coin is now the “real bitcoin” is misleading to investors. In traditional markets, doing this is a criminal offense.
@_date: 2018-03-24 23:52:28
My bank already solved it, is my point. They got me covered. True “trustless” transacting
@_date: 2018-02-23 05:20:30
This is like watching bitconnect all over again. Pay attention people. Look into tether/bitfinex and remove your bias. What’s going on is crystal clear
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:31:06
Everyone with crypto is invested in tether. I have no crypto right now - I sold as soon as I found out about tether.
 I’m lucky enough to have safer investment opportunities that I will stay involved in fully, until tether is either audited successfully or burnt to the ground. One of those outcomes is eventually guaranteed. I’ll be patient, and won’t buy crypto until that time comes. Hopefully happens soon! I love this industry 
@_date: 2018-02-16 14:22:12
I didn’t say they were guilty. I’m saying that a rise in bitcoins price without tether printing is not proof that bitfinex is not manipulating the market.
@_date: 2018-03-20 20:26:25
It’s called Front running
@_date: 2018-03-07 21:55:34
Fair enough! I guess I just consider it much more than just a concern. To each their own, best of luck to ya
@_date: 2018-03-17 00:07:43
Not even close. Market first needs to be cleansed of toxic exchanges committing daily fraud by means of wash trading and counterfeit *cough* tether *cough* bitfinex 
@_date: 2018-03-15 23:36:41
Not even close to over. See: bitfinex &amp; tether
@_date: 2018-03-27 19:48:30
Definitely tether + fomo
@_date: 2018-03-09 16:45:14
@_date: 2018-03-24 22:03:49
Perhaps! All I know is that my bank saves my ass often because I’m using untrusted merchants a lot. This makes my credit card much more trustless for transacting than bitcoin 
@_date: 2018-03-15 11:26:34
Buddy it going way lower
@_date: 2018-02-16 12:59:24
This doesn’t mean anything. If bitcoin was actually pump n dumped by bitfinex, this means they sold their bitcoin at higher levels so they would be sitting on a mountain of tether or USD - no reason to print more.
I’m NOT suggesting that this is what happened over the last week. I’m simply shedding light to the complete argument and letting you know that just because tethers weren’t printed doesn’t mean bitfinex isn’t manipulating anything.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:07:03
No relief for any investor with half a brain. Tether promises REGULAR audits, they have ZERO audits. Why?
@_date: 2018-02-16 03:06:37
I can agree with all this actually. Fair points!
@_date: 2018-02-15 21:57:08
Back where? To half it’s ATH? Lol I like the enthusiasm but there is still a long way to go. 
Especially with all this tether/ bitfinex fraud

Yes! :p

Easy- It’s purposely misleading and run by criminals. 
@_date: 2018-03-07 13:19:18
The two are completely irrelevant. Segwit and bathing help with tx fees and Tx throughput. They help TX volume.
Exchange volume has nothing to do with this. Jump on GDAX and check the volume there. That’s how many bitcoins are trading hands in a 24 hour period. Nothing to do with batching or segwit
@_date: 2018-03-25 00:56:28
Hopefully! Not yet tho
@_date: 2018-03-28 19:49:35
That makes more sense. I certainly may be confused between the two 
@_date: 2018-02-16 02:32:51
You clearly did not listen to the tapes if you didn’t find evidence for fraud lmao. Idc how long I’ve been on Reddit for. Evidence is evidence and I sure as Fuck didn’t hear a counter argument to what is exposed in those tapes

Why does something that is “trustless” require reputation? You’re missing the point entirely
