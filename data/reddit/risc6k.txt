Good to know man.
I'm HODLing too then. Looking at the chart, it does seem pretty stable, if anything it may continue to go up up and up IF BTC goes up offcourse.
I guess im just panicking for no reason. Sorry.

Boy oh boy .. being “watched” you didn’t give any examples so don’t know what all this schizophrenia really means! Chill out dawwwg. Why would bank know or care. Ive xfered money to coinbase too from chase and other banks, they don’t care. Cc purchases are obviously prohibited now, did a few of those too early this year before they were all banned. Like you I haven’t withdrawn any money from cryptos out yet, alls been sold and reexchanged. Crunch time will be when and if  I(we) do and report any gains in schedule D. It’ll be a bit of a nightmare to figure cost basis etc but oh well. Till then jusss chill and I can assure you no ones “watching” you! lol

Did you reach out to coinbase? How can anyone hack yer coinbase?? Someone stole yer phone? 2FA ? Hello
@_date: 2018-06-25 03:31:05
Yes prolly that low correct
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:07:00
Yea it would be nice but look at the market overall. Current BTC price ain’t optimal for miners profits.

Or will you ��
