Miner incentives does not necessarily align with user incentives. And different miners will prefer different limits. A miner imposed limit would turn into a weapon that some miners would use to eliminate competition, and in turn centralize Bitcoin mining even more.

That's really some backwards thinking. In cryptography, the theory and math behind something is harder to come up with than an actual implementation.
The internet existed some 30+ years before satoshi invented bitcoin. The hard part wasn't to code it. It was to invent the protocol in the first place.
So the hard part of mimblewimble is already done. Although we might see even more improvements before it actually gets implemented.

Different attacks have completely different potential risks and rewards. A 51% attack has almost no reward, except for any entity that completely wants to ruin the network. Tx filtering has no reward at the moment, but could be a potential future problem if governments starts making demands or incentivizing miners to do so.
The block size limit is a completely seperate topic, and has to be analyzed on its own merits. You can't just say attack X wasn't a problem so attack Y obviously won't be.
The attack in this case is that every miner has a different tolerance for block size. Imagaine that 95% of miners can handle blocks of 2 MB. Blocks reach this size and 5% of miners are outcompeted. Now, 95% of the 95% can also handle 2,5 MB blocks. So the active miners vote to make blocks 2,5 MB and 5% of the new set of miners are outcompeted. Now, 95% of 95% of the 95% can handle slightly bigger blocks, so a few more miners dissappear. Continue until all mining happens by one miner who hides by faking multiple pools. Can you tell me why this won't happen?

Create a hd wallet seed. Then create the corresponding pubx and export it to a computer. You can use the pubx to create as many bitcoin adresses as you want seperate from the private keys. If your pubx is compromised, the most anyone can do against you is see all your adresses and payments. 
You could create the hd wallet seed and the pubx by hand, but it would be extremely error prone, so I'd recommend an air gapped computer.

They're cryptographically secure to end up on the chain. And you can use them immediately as well.
So a LN transaction is like a check that's cryptograhically secured it won't bounce. So for all practical purposes it can be treated as money in the bank already.

The incentives for all participants in Bitcoin is far more complex than that.
You could just as well argue against exit scams in DNMs by saying they won't happen because it's in the interest of the DNM to build a reputation and not scam its customers. Even though that's true, exit scams have still happened.
The same is true of the miner pools. The health of the Bitcoin network is only one incentive of many. Some miners may be more short sighted and prefer increased short term profits over long term profits. Some may just do something that they see increases their profit while not understanding the long term implications. 
Brushing the entire issue of by saying, "miners won't do anything that damages their long term profits" is simplistic, naive and flat out dangerous. Miners are companies, and sometimes companies do stuff that damages their long term profits.

But you originally asked how the would know you are using encryption.

Coding is only part of software development. You need a clear idea of what you are creating before you can even start coding. If you are just typing buttons randomly you won't get a working program.
In cryptography this is even more true. The algorithms themself may be simple to code, but inventing good crypto-algorithms and proving they're secure is anything but simple. 
You won't build a skyscraper without a blueprint. Your argument is synonymous to thinking that the task of building a skyscraper consists of nothing but construction. There's a lot of work even before construction starts, and there are more people that can follow a blueprint than create one and guarantee that it will work.

*You* may not have an idea that it will work. But people smarter than you can tell you wether it will work or not.
And you don't prove algorithms through implementations. Software is math. It is possible to tell what the result of math is without testing it in the real world. You can probably tell what the result of 2+2 is without counting on your fingers.

The fact that you can do an action in an undetectable way does not exclude doing it in a detectable way.
I can see you encrypt something and jail you for it. I can see you perform subtraction and kill you for it on the spot. It requires a really authoritarian government, but it's not impossible. If you want a real life example of where you would get killed over performing simple mathemathics (as well as anything else that would classify you as an intellectual), look at Pol Pots regime. 
And laws do not require exact definitions, so that's a moot point as well. The government could ban encrypted data, as well as psuedorandom data that looks encrypted. Then it would be up to the court's discretion wether the data they find on your computer fits the definition.

I have read it multiple times.
Section 4 that you referred to says that mining solves the problem of majority decision making in decentralized systems. 
It does NOT say that majority voting is a suitable mechanism for determining protocol rules. That is your interpretation, which just so happens to be completely at odds with Satoshis own clarifications of the white paper. The issue of decentralized consensus was however discussed in section 2 as a necessary mechanism to avoid double spending. To me it seems obvious that section 4 is presented as a solution to the problem described in section 2, not as a general voting system for all decision making. This is also consistent with Satoshi's description of a 51% attack. 
And I am not cherry picking. A 51% attack is described by Satoshi on numerous occasions, always as a very limited attack. You can read the entire conversation with all context in the mailing list, or look for early posts elsewhere, and his words would still support my position. His intentions were very clear. Mining decides on the order of transactions. A bad actor with a majority vote is limited to changing the order of already spent coins. 
Is it really so hard to think that you have misunderstood the white paper, so that you have to argue against the author's very own explanation of it? 
@_date: 2016-04-14 09:07:48
It's not an altcoin regardless of how many times you repeat the lie. It's a smart contract platform. It uses payment channel contracts which was invented by satoshi himself. Smart contracts has been part of the vision of Bitcoin from the very beginning. 
Payment channels need a client that can handle payment channels, which is the case for all smart contracts. All contracts and scripts need clients that support them so there's nothing unique here. Is multisig an altcoin because not all clients support it?
But there's really no reason for me to waste time and argue with someone who just repeats lies even when they're debunked. So consider this my last post in this thread.

This sentence is ironic because of this sentence. 


That's a zero interest loan you seem to be describing. Why would anyone let you use their money for your discretionary spending without getting anything in return?
Off course there's interest on credit though. It's just spread out unevenly. The only reason a few responsible people can save money through responsible use of credit cards is because most don't use it responsibly enough. The majority would be better off with debit cards rather than credit.
Spending money you have is better than spending money you don't have. Because spending money you don't have inevitably comes with a cost. The exception to this rule is when you can get someone else to bear this cost.

For the consumer, LN is not necessarily any more hot than a regular Bitcoin wallet. You need to sign a transaction to set up a channel, and you need to sign all your LN transactions. But there's no reason for your keys to be online. They can be stored with trezor like security.
LN nodes however need to be hot in order to facilitate instant transfers for their users. But I'm fairly sure they only need to be partially hot. A node could set up a channel transaction using multiple inputs and keep most private keys offline and bring them online as needed.

No one is blocking other scaling solutions. Schnorr signatures are still coming. Signature aggregation is likely still coming. But you are not referring to other scaling solutions in general. You are referring to your specific favorite scaling solution of simply raising the block size.
The gamble would be to ignore decentralization issues and simply go with your gut feelings on how a block size increase would affect the network health. Doing research and comparing different solutions before choosing the one to go with is not the gamble. It's the conservative and sensible way to design cryptosystems.

Decreased demand for consumer goods is good for economic growth. This is underconsumption and is the very foundation for growth. Did you try to read my link on how an economy grows and learn something. It's quite easily digestible, and even if you don't agree, I believe at least it would be productive for our discussion as you would better understand my position.


Unemployment is caused by not allowing the limited resource labor to clear at a market rate People who talk about jobs as if they're a limited resource doesn't understand economics. There's always an almost infinite amount of jobs. Any potential need is a potential job. The purpose of a healthy economy is to eliminate jobs so that we collectively get more consumption for less effort.


That's an easy cop-out to stay ignorant. "If you disagree with me I have no interest in having any form of discussion with you."


Yes, that's a fact. Stating a fact does not prove it is an issue. The belief that it's an issue comes from an incorrect view on economic growth and capital theory. Your talk about decreased demand among other things suggests that you subscribe to this incorrect view that demand for consumption goods somehow helps generating growth, when in fact it hinders it.

@_date: 2019-07-02 13:16:26


That wasn't my intention, so I'm sorry if that's how you took it. 
However, i didn't say you used the word consumption. I said that your argument relies on a misconception on how economies grow, and consumption's role in economic growth is part of that misconception.
Anyone who understands economic growth and proper capital theory would know that deflation incentivizes savings, and is therefore a catalyst of growth as savings is the basis for investment. You saying that it prevents growth shows that you have at least some misconception of how an economy grows. 
Investment relies on the existence of a capital pool. Savings increase the capital pool. Consumption reduces it. Deflation incentivizes savings and disincentivizes consumption, and thus it increases the capital pool and the total amount of possible investments.


This is a kind of self contradiction though. If we imagine an economy where Bitcoin is the only currency and no one is using anything else, then the economy will only be price deflationary to the the extent that it is already growing. If it is not growing at all we will not see deflation. So your scenario assumes growth to begin with, and uses this as an argument for why growth isn't possible.
The argument is basically "A, therefore not A" which is not a logically sound argument.

Doesn't matter though, because you're still just moving the goal posts. I just claimed that it was possible to lose funds by sending to the wrong type of address, and you finally seem to acknowledge this fact, so I don't have much more to argue.

You got that backwards. It was larger than 1mb in its early stages.


Yes it does.


There are very significant marginal returns when it comes to node count because of increased adoption. Late adopters are far less likely to be technical users, and thus far less likely to have interest in running a full node. The argument is entirely theoretical, and the statistics doesn't support it.
Ethereum only has the number of nodes they have because they decided nodes don't need to fully verify the blockchain. So their node count is not relevant at all. I'm just waiting to see what chaos will ensue the first time a miner actually mines an invalid block.


The statistic is also inherently extremely unreliable. I could easily create a coin where I have all the supply, and then just trade an extremely limited supply between me and my friends for an inflated price. For example, Ripple actually has 60 billion more coins than what is shown on coinmarketcap. Just do the same thing but to an even larger extreme and you could easily have a new coin with 99% of crypto market cap.
Market cap can give you an indication of where a coin is, but you're reading too much into it. The distribution of a coin affects the market cap more than the actual utility of the coin.

Ethereum is not used for a single thing except speculation that it will be broadly adopted in the future. And a lot of that speculation is based on a flawed belief that it's trustless. Yes, it's attracting investors, but once that market is saturated, at some point they'll go, "hey, why did I invest in this thing in the first place if it's not trustless?" How is Ethereum actually improving the world?

Most of the core developers were pretty ok with the situation when miners blocked segwit. They said the believed it was a good upgrade for Bitcoin and miners shouldn't really be in control of protocol rules, but if Bitcoin doesn't get segwit then it's still a really good product. The core devs have made it clear that they can't force a hardfork on anyone.

What we need is confidential transactions with bulletproofs and schnorr signatures with signature aggregation.

Actually, miners do pretty ok by just assuming that the last block was valid most of the time. There's already been 1 fairly serious incident in Bitcoin caused by non-validating miners. Close to 50% of Bitcoin miners didn't validate blocks before starting to mine the next one, and the validation cost for Bitcoin is a fraction of that for Ethereum.

If you send BCH to a segwit address, the Bitcoin Cash network will consider it valid because a segwit address is indistinguishable from regular P2SH-adresses. It's only when you spend from a P2SH-address that the network notices a difference.
To be fair though, the Bcash network doesn't consider segwit addresses unspendable. Quite the opposite actually, it considers them spendable without a signature at all. This means that as soon as you try to spend from a segwit address on the Bcash network, anyone who observes your transaction can copy it and try to spend the funds to themselves, which is how it could lead to a loss. The only safe way to retrieve the funds would be to mine themselves (and even that would not be secure in case of a reorg).
@_date: 2017-12-20 13:07:24
Bcash doesn't have segwit. It won't get schnorr signatures. It won't get signature aggregation. It won't get MAST. And it's led by people with a lack of adversarial thinking who don't seem to care about decentralization. It's simply an inferior product, and the market will take care of the problem by punishing those who are stupid enough to fall for the snake oil.

The trezor isn't connected to the Internet and doesn't download updates automatically. If you're worried about malicious updates you could simply avoid all new firmware for a few weeks giving people time to read through the source code looking for malicious stuff. 
You are talking about hacking as if it is magic. There are limits to what is possible. The trezor is an offline device that uses a simple communication protocol to receive unsigned transactions and to send signed transactions. That is very limited and getting the private keys of the Trezor is nothing like jailbreaking an iPhone. It's closer to jailbreaking an iPhone by only sending it text messages, while all other communications are shut off by hardware means.

20 BTC at 225 USD is 4500 USD.
If you want to invest for that amount I recommend you buy a Trezor as well. It's a hardware wallet, and probably the best way out there to secure your coins.
It's 99 USD though so you need a few coins to really justify the price, but if you buy for 4500 it amounts to about 2% extra cost which is a fairly reasonable price for secure storage and ease of mind.

It connects to a PC and recieves an unsigned transaction yes. You then need to verify the recieving adress and the amount on the trezor screen before it signs the transaction and sends it back to the PC. A compromised PC still can't force the trezor to sign a malicious transaction. You need to physically press a button on the trezor itself.

Not really. If you make a parking lot at a mall, you don't need a parking space for every customer ever, just enough for any amount of customers that may visit at the same time. 
It's not reasonable to assume that everyone may spend everything at the same place. In your example, the customers have to lock up 10 BTC each, and the hub locks up an amount that corresponds to an expected volume for each merchant. If the estimation of the size of the merchant payment channel is wrong they can always make another channel, and lock up some more funds, although if a channel "gets full" I guess payments to that merchant would temporarily not work.
The hubs and merchants have to make their best estimate, and compare the pros of cons of accidentally locking up way too much money, and being forced to make multiple payment channels with extra blockchain overhead. 
Although BTC would still have to be valued a lot higher for this to work at even the scale in your example. We can't have millions of people locking up 10 BTC each for obvious reasons, but they can lock up a smaller amount at a higher value per BTC. 
@_date: 2015-06-03 21:06:59
But in order for that to be safe that machine should never be used online, so it is a dedicated hardware wallet. In which case the paper wallet is just unnecessary complexity. You could just store the keys on the offline machine at all times.
@_date: 2015-12-07 01:21:40
Trezor is a dedicated hardware device that creates and manages all keys and signatures by itself. You connect it to your computer to do a transaction, but before the transaction is valid you need to confirm it on the Trezor screen and by pressing a button on it. The keys never leave the device, so you need physical access to the Trezor to make a transaction.
The Ledger doesn't work the same way at all. Although it's probably very secure I can't tell you anything about the details. I prefer the Trezor way of complete isolation of the private keys. 
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:05:31
The hub needs to lock up money with all potential receivers as well. In effect, B and C don't care about A's transactions with the hub. If the hub guarantees them coins, they have the coins regardless of if the hub has made sure it has corresponding guarantees. So in your scenario where the hub promises 8 BTC to B and 8 BTC to C without a 16 BTC promise from A to the hub, the hub loses.

You create a deterministic papper wallet backup the first time you start the trezor and create your wallet, so the funds would be recoverable.

Yes, I believe the hubs need to buy/own/borrow BTC and then take out fees high enough to motivate their lock up of capital. I have no idea how high that will turn out to be. If a coin in the lightning network will be used on average 10 times a year then my understanding says that the fee needs to be at least a regular yearly interest divided by 10. I may be totally wrong though, and as you say, if there is a trick that reduces/eliminates the amount of BTC the hub needs, then that will reduce the needed fees considerably as well.

Another important point is that it keeps all the middle men compatible with eachother. Bitcoin is a universal standard for internet payments. This eliminates the network effect where everyone is locked in to the same payment provider in order to make payments to eachother seamlessly.

Actually the contrary is true in most cases. Bitpay has reported that they have seen the biggest increases in spending when the price rises. Overstock also reported recently that their volume has declined this year as the price has gone down.

While the incentives for consumers are quite low, there are incentives for B2B transactions. 
Microsoft is a big company, so they very well could save all their bitcoins as an experiment. The potential cost is a drop in the bucket for them. And they do need furniture for their offices, and hardware for their servers etc, so sometime in the future they may have enough bitcoins to make a big purchase from another merchant. Even if this merchant immediately cashes in their bitcoins we have still increased the average amount of transactions between exchanges.
Right now most bitcoin circulation go exchange -&gt; customer -&gt; merchant -&gt; exchange. We don't neccesarily need more customers. We just need to make the chain longer. If it's longer, the savings of bitcoin transactions will be greater than the cost of exchanging the bitcoins for fiat. And just like merchants started accepting bitcoins because the fan base became large enough to care about it, as soon as merchants are collectively holding a large enough stash, their suppliers will begin to offer the option.
It may not be Microsoft that starts this, They are just a good candidate as their size makes them potentially less risk averse. This is more of a general trend that I'm looking out for. Anyone could be the first to take the next step.

Volatility and acceptance aren't inherent traits though. Traits such as scarcity and portability are things that will always remain the same, whereas volatility and acceptance may change with time. The theory is that good money will eventually become widely accepted and stable. These properties are the consequence of good money, not the cause of it. You could still add them to the list if you want. There is just a big difference compared to the rest of the list.
I would lower Bitcoin on fungibility though. Every single satoshi is distinguishable from another.

Example, say I'm at a computer and browses a web site that needs authentication. The web site gives me a QR code that I scan with my phone.

That statement really needs some context. The context was what to do if Bitcoin's cryptography seemed like it would be broken in a few years because of quantum computers.
Some people said we should upgrade to a quantum proof encryption algorithm but do nothing else, and once the crypto eventually gets broken, anyone with money in non-quantum proof addresses will simply have it stolen, leaving potentially millions of bitcoin in the hands of one thief.
Theymos argued that this would be a systemic risk to Bitcoin, and it would be better to give people a few years to send coins to a quantum proof address, and then freeze all unprotected coins assuming they were lost. From the victims perspective this is about the same as having the coins stolen, but it would be far safer for the ecosystem as a whole.

If you ran 5000 nodes I could still only double spend you, so that has the same value as you running 1 node.


Yes, and those nodes would be worthless. Good job wasting money.


But no one is talking about a simple count. Node count is irrelevant and easily gameable. Amount of users actually adhering to a specific rule set isn't gameable. You can run a trillion nodes, and you still can't fool Bitstamp because they do their own verification.


But there is no such incentive. The only incentive is to protect yourself against fake blocks. 1 node serves the same purpose as 5000 in this regard. The incentives are as follows, anyone who doesn't really use Bitcoin can do whatever they want. They don't really matter. Those who do use Bitcoin are incentivized to protect themselves against blocks that everyone else would disregard, thus they want to run the same code as everyone else.
You could run whatever code you want on your node. It doesn't matter. Bitstamp can't. They would lose money. Coinbase can't. They would lose money. Bitpay can't. They would lose money. They have actual businesses to protect, so the only incentive is for them to run the same rule set as everyone else who has a business to protect. And the only way for them to do this is to not change the rules at all (or through a very coordinated change).

Let them fork. A hardfork would be a clusterfuck, but Bitcoin would prevail. The miners themselves would be the biggest losers as they realize they are just mining on a chain that the economic majority is discarding. So let them fork and lose their money. Then maybe they'll realize the advantage of a softfork increase like segwit.

Peter Todd has published the game theoretical miner publication incentives. It turns out they were more complicated than Satoshi assumed.
There are multiple papers on selfish mining. Selfish mining means that Bitcoin becomes vulnerable at a lower mining concentration than 51% as Satoshi assumed.
See the following papers (these are just a few examples, selfish mining is a farily well-studied subject by now, you'll find plenty more if you google it):
On top of that we've had multiple simulations of how the block size affects mining centralization. Even the Bitcoin Classic developers own simulations showed that some pretty bad things start happening at block sizes of around ~4MB. I'm not very well versed on the simulations though and I've only followed discussions on the dev mailing list so I can't provide you with any links. I'm just a layman who tries to understand the issues and follow the mailing list to stay on top of things. So if you want more info on how the simulations were done I suggest you ask someone more suitable. All I know is that we currently have a lot of knowledge that Satoshi couldn't consider because it didn't exist back in 2009/2010. I also find it completely reckless to just disregard the current knowledge and act like some religious person refering to Satoshi's arguments like some religious scripture.
@_date: 2017-02-28 11:57:02
~2.1 MB blocks have higher centralization pressures than 1 MB blocks. Most devs seem to agree that we start to see some pretty bad consequences around 3-4 MB blocks (even simulations made by Bitcoin Classic devs showed this). Some devs even think blocks bigger than 1 Mb is risky.
So by implementing segwit in a way that increases the block size as well we are compromising decentralization for higher capacity. This is not a necessary compromise for segwit, but most devs seem to agree it is fine in this case.

You can't be 100% sure there is no exploit that gives access to the memory via USB either.
And as for QR-codes, there is nothing new there either. Someone can feed you malicious transaction info via USB as well. This risk is mitigated through confirming the adress on the Trezors screen. If you don't do that you are at risk regardless of the way the transaction was sent to the Trezor.
Case in point, you could create the device I'm describing without any changes to the current Trezor. Just tape a smart phone on the back of your trezor and let them communicate to eachother via USB. Now you have a Trezor+ with built in camera, NFC, bluetooth and wifi. All you need now is the right software for the phone. The device I'm describing is exactly this but in a neater package.

The vision was always about the ideals, not the method. I invested in Bitcoins because I believe in the ideal of permissionless private value transactions on the Internet. If this happen in one or ten layers is completely irrelevant as long as all the layers are cryptographically secure and the ideals are preserved. If one of the layers even adds functionality like instantaneously confirmed transactions it's just better. 
Its like complaining about the amount of layers used for Internet communication. Why do you care how many layers are on top of each other to make it work?

I don't think that's entirely true. As I understand it, the 7 tps calculation is not using the smallest type of transactions.

It's just that the average transaction size has become bigger with time for some reason so the old calculation is no longer accurate.

The only issue I have is to get the incentives right.

This is a lot different than a re-org. A Bitcoin re-org really only happens because of latency when different miners find a block close to the same time. Everyone still agrees on what constitutes the correct chain, it's the chain containing only valid transactions with the most amount of work behind it. There's no disagreement here, but sometimes the valid chain changes from one to another because miners find blocks close to eachother.
Consistent disagreement in which chain is actually the correct one is vastly different. Bitcoin Unlimited is a consensus algorithm that provably doesn't create a consensus in a lot of cases. The only time it actually consistently does create a consensus, is when people purposefully avoid to use its so called features. That's a broken consensus algorithm, period.


No, that's not how it works. Bitcoin's current consensus algorithm has stood up to at least 1000s of hours of peer review, and about 8 years of actual testing in the wild. If you want to make radical changes to the consensus algorithm then you have to proove that it is as robust to justify the change. Bitcoin Unlimited doesn't even stand up to some quick back of the envelope peer review with horribly weak assumptions (you can completely disregard malicious actors for example, and it still looks bad). It is a provably much weaker consensus algorithm than Bitcoin currently has.

You have to remember that Bitcoin is two things, a payment system and a monetary unit. Bitcoin's monetary properties will remain the same regardless of how it's transacted. It's deflationary, divisible, higly transportable and impossible to counterfeit. It also allows smart contracts, real time audits of financial insititutions and similar innovations.
From a libertarian standpoint, the monetary properties of Bitcoin were always far more interesting than the transactional properties. It's called a *cryptocurrency* after all, not a *crypto-'payment system'*. In fact, we already had plenty of cryptographic schemes for transactiing before Bitcoin, but these were limited to only transact ownership of something. If you wanted to transact dollars these had to be stored somewhere, which inevitably creates a central point of failure, which is why none of them ever took of. The big innovation with Bitcoin was not the payment system, but the currency unit. For the first time in history, we had a digital good that could be transacted digitally without the central point of failure. It was the missing piece in the puzzle for all the already existing cryptographic payment systems. The fact that Bitcoin includes a payment system in itself is just a bonus, but in no way critical to its future success.
Gold was also a good monetary base, but it became inefficient for modern payments, which is why people started looking for "second layer solutions," bank notes backed by gold. This eventually failed, because it centralized the base layer (gold), and the agreements between banks and its customers were just words, so ultimately the agreements were broken with the permission of the government.
With Bitcoin we have a chance of doing this the right way. We can create payment methods without complete centralization. Through smart contracts we can make agreements that are impossible to break. Through real time auditing we can limit fractional reserve banking and prevent inflation for good. But all of this relies on the premise that the base layer doesn't ever get compromised. How we transact with bitcoins is secondary. The most important thing is that the currency unit of bitcoin remains what it is. If we fail and accidentaly centralize the base layer, then we may end up repeating the path that gold monetary system took in its path towards fiat.

Oh yeah, totally agree. That wasn't the point I was trying to make though, and I may have been a bit unclear.
I'm saying that multi-user transactoins are one reason that the current average transaction size is higher than was estimated originally in the 7 TPS calculation. So my point was simply that the math in the OP understates the current transaction rate somewhat. In no way does accounting for this increase the transaction rate to over 7 TPS though.

This is also true if the majority of miners decides to mine a block that no modes consider valid. The majority of miners just wasted energy.
And that's the reason why miners don't determine consensus. They can either mine blocks that the ecosystem of nodes accept, or waste energy. 5000 nodes run by the same person are meaningless. 5000 nodes run by different users, exchanges, stores and businesses aren't.

All that would happen is that fees would go up until supply meets demand again. People would start using the blockchain more effectively, not sending back and forth between their own wallets unless really necessary, trying new stuff on the test net rather on the Bitcoin blockchain etc.
Demand is unlimited. The only reason blocks haven't been full until now is because of the price floor of transaction fees. Economically, this is not the point where blocks fill up. This is the point where the market price of transactions rise above the price floor. If the price floor weren't there, blocks would be full regardless of size, just with a different market price for transactions. 1 MB, 2 MB or 100 MB? It doesnt matter. They would fill up regardless without the price floor.

Difficulty increases are more continuous (there's not been a 100% immediate increase in modern times). They are also a result of miners having high margins and increasing hashing power as a result. They can't happen in a low margin environment. 
The halving could theoretically happen at a time where mining is very competitive and margins are super low. This could be a potential problem in a future halving. If it causes enough miners to be unprofitable at the same time, then so many of them could drop out that the time until the next difficulty increase extends to months (as well as time between blocks increasing to hours).
It seems like we are surely fine this time though as we had quite a price rise already and mining is probably not that low margin yet, but it certainly could be an issue.

The way segwit works is that it seperates all transaction data in two parts. Old nodes only need one part, whereas upgraded nodes need both parts.
This is how it can be done as a softfork. As far as old nodes are concerned, the 1 MB rule was not broken, because they only have 1 MB of data (they only see a lot of really small transactions with very weird spending rules). But new nodes that are aware of the new rules know that this is not all of the data and requires the second part as well for a block to be valid. For upgraded nodes, there is an increase in the diskspace and bandwidth requirements to ~2.1 MB (assuming todays transaction types).
This is also why the new block size limit is not a fixed value. The limit for each block depends on the transactions included in it. There is also some sense behind this as different data creates different amount of workload for nodes. Signature data is prunable, so it is cheaper to handle for nodes than the non-prunable transaction data. With segwit, both the block size limit and the transaction fees are adjusted for this (it's very likely that this adjustment is not perfect, but it's at least better than treating all data the same regardless of cost).

You need to explain this. What exactly do you think will happen to Bitcoin at the point where blocks are consistently getting full, and how long will it take? 


I didn't intend to imply that there are no market forces at work for fees today, so sorry if that's what you got out of it. My point still stands though. The two situations are fundamentally different and we may still gain valuable knowledge from seeing how the system reacts to full blocks.
So unless you can explain how Bitcoin just immediately implodes once this happen, I don't see the rush. The only threat would be from an altcoin with a higher limit, and Bitcoin has a head start of multiple years.
I'm pretty sure a large majority of the people who are talking about chaos unless we rush this change through are only doing it because they want to go to the moon as fast as possible and cash out. But think of the bigger picture. Bitcoin Classic is basically an attempt to take over the reference client and change the protocol by popular opinion. If we allow this precedent to be set, we pretty much guarantee that it's going to happen again multiple times in the future. Do you want a Bitcoin where anyone with a big enough PR budget can get their changes through?
Edit: Precedents are set, not said.

Node count is trivially gameable so such a thing makes BU worse than if it was miners only. You really can't have thought about this subject critically for very long if you think that's a good feature.
In general your entire post is very focused on finding weak arguments, but a critical mind should spend most of his time looking for the strong arguments against his beliefs. Both r/bitcoin and r/btc is full of bullshit. If you focus on that you're just wasting your time, and worse, you become very susceptible to confirmation bias.
When I first heard about Bitcoin I spent weeks trying to figure out why it couldn't work or be as good as it seemed. But it turned out that every potential weakness I could think about had been accounted for. During the past years, I have found a few issues where I'm still uncertain about how it will play out in the future, but any "obvious" weakness that any critical mind would first think of doesn't actually work.
If I apply the same scrutiny against Bitcoin Unlimited it takes a few minutes of google searches to find some really strong arguments against it. For example, these two articles by Aaron van Wirdum.

No, it's controversial because the centralization forces of bigger blocks aren't fully understood. The fact that some people thinks it's a good idea to force it through in one month despite the warnings of some of the most experienced and knowledgeable cryptocurrency developers just adds to that.
This is similar to people who think a lower confirmation time is always better and without any drawbacks, and who pushes altcoins with confirmation times of 10 seconds and the like. They simply don't understand the issue and shouldn't be listened to.

But the orphan rate correlates to how fast your block reaches other miners. A miner wants to get his block to other miners as fast as possible to minimize the risk that they see another valid block before yours. Regular nodes don't help with that. 
If anything, regular nodes are a distraction in this regard. You don't want to waste time and bandwidth sending your block to them. You want an immediate connection with the biggest mining farms. You aren't safe until all other miners have your block. Then, you can start sending it to regular nodes.

The question is why? Ethereum is an application platform, not a currency. First mover advantage doesn't exist the same way it does with currencies. Developers will run their apps where it is cheapest and most convenient, and they can easily move their app to Rootstock as its backwards compatible with Ethereum. 
If you run your app on Ethereums chain, then you will have to pay an exchange fee between Bitcoin and ether. With Rootstock you won't. Also, ether will likely be far more volatile than BTC, making Rootstock more stable and convenient as well. Why won't developers just start switching (or copying) their apps over to Rootstock as soon as these advantages become obvious?

No, the split was an accidental hard fork. The save was to unfork it.
Basically, we had two chains, a shorter one everyone found valid, and a longer one that everyone who hadn't upgraded to 0.80 found invalid. The situation was saved by making sure the chain that everyone found valid became the longest. So swift action by the devs convinced enough miners to revert back to the old version of the bitcoin client. And once the old chain became the longer one, even the miners who didn't revert started working on it merely because it was now the longest.
So that entire ordeal was really the complete opposite of a good example for hard forks.

That sentence is just poorly worded. They are all combined into two transactions (one that opens a payment channel, and one that closes it). Rather than making a thousand small transactions,  you make two bigger ones.

Miner centralization is easy to hide. A ddos attack isn't. So the incentives for any miner is to centralize all hashing power to himself, but hide it.
Also, there's a big difference between attacking the network, and simply using its rules it to your own advantage. With dynamic block sizes, mining centralization through increasing the block size would not even be an attack, it's the equilibrium. It's where the system would naturally converge even if every miner was completely honest. Adding malicious miners to the mix compounds the problem, but it's already bad enough as it is without them.

It's only on reddit that there has been a blocksize debate. For developers the debate has been broader than that. It's been a scalability debate, and there has been some real progress in this debate. The debate is just too technical to fit into reddits one-dimensional narrative. If you read Greg Maxwells summary of the progress below you can get a real feeling for all the nuances that actually has to be taken into consideration, and what progress has been made. 


All things aren't equal, and that's the problem. Any confirmation time that is low enough to make a difference in brick and mortar environments, has a very high tradeoff when it comes to orphan rates and scalability. 5 or 10 minutes barely ever matter. 5 seconds only works with very small transaction throughput. This makes it a dead away sign that whenever someone brings up lower confirmation times as a selling point for their altcoin, that person has no idea whatsoever what he's talking about.


It's not about differing opinions, but about unqualified opinions. How high would you value your own opinion when it comes to the construction of airplanes? Because you do seem to vastly overestimate the value of your input when it comes to engineering decisions in Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is different. When a company makes a product they want to make it as popular as possible as fast as possible. Bitcoin is about providing privacy and a censorship resistant payment means for the Internet. This does not necessarily translate to the most popular payment mean. More users are better only as long as the core ideals of Bitcoin isn't compromised away.
So consumer wants aren't as relevant here as for regular products, because maximizing users isn't the primary goal. The goal is to build a robust, private and cryptographically secure payment system. Maximizing users is a secondary goal. 
Don't get me wrong, scaling Bitcoin is still a very high priority for me. But Bitcoin core has a scaling plan that is pretty good still. But more importantly they are doing hard work to improve bitcoin in every other way as well. Bitcoin classic has absolutely nothing except for a change in one single variable. The fact that so many people are prepared to give away control from core to Classic is absolutely crazy.

The more Bitcoin grows the less the average person will care about learning about bitcoin. The average Bitcoiner knew way more about Bitcoin in 2009 than in 2011 and way more in 2013 than in 2015.
We are building the Internet of money here. If Bitcoin succeeds most people will neither know nor care about the 21 million coin cap or the block reward halving. They will just care about how Bitcoin helps them go about their daily life. And the average person trusts governments way more than anarchists and libertarians. 
So the Bitcoin Classic crowd are trying to set a precedent here that will undoubtedly lead down a very dangerous slippery slope. It's not about the change to the protocol really. It's about how it's being conducted by trying to take over the reference client. 
Bitcoin Core is the reference client and it has to remain the reference client.

No, it's because every single post seem to be obsessed with conspiracy theories about how core devs are evil and are actively doing everything they can to destroy Bitcoin, rather than just having a differing opinion.
Also, if you have a different opinion there you get downvoted to oblivion, regardless of how you present your opinion. So it's censorship by hiding hiding content rather than flat out deleting it. Kind of like if google would put certain search results last, and claim it's not censorship because they didn't delete it from their search results completely.

The developers don't control the protocol. The activation of segwit is proof of this.
The Bitcoin protocol is somewhat set in stone and is extremely hard to change, and that is also bitcoin's biggest strength. If the protocol was easy to change, then it would inevitably become centralized sooner or later, as whoever was throwing money at it would be able to buy influence.
@_date: 2017-03-28 02:30:16
No I'm not. I'm implying the control is fairly spread out between developers, miners, users and nodes.
Developers have quite a big influence over the protocol, but no direct control.
Miners have quite a bit of control when it comes to soft forks. Most importantly, a small minority of miners can veto changes, but other than that their control is quite limited.
Nodes and users have control when it comes to some softforks, but not others. For example, they could refuse to use a segwit softfork leaving the network pretty much the same even if miners voted for segwit, but they could not refuse to use a softfork that censored certain transactions.
When it comes to hardforks the control lies entirely in the hands of users. Miners *could* hardfork Bitcoin, but without the users following them they would just be wasting money. In general, the miners are incentivized to follow the most valuable fork, and that is the fork that people are using.
All in all, Bitcoin decentralization is not perfect, but it's pretty damn good, and saying that the developers have all the control is a flat out lie. They are the ones with the least amount of control, but maybe the most amount of influence.
@_date: 2016-03-21 21:02:51
To decrease the median block size you would have to willingly leave money on the table, effectively giving transaction fees to all other miners, including the one who tries to increase the block size in the first place

Segwit and changing pow, however controversial you may think they are, at least work as advertised.
@_date: 2017-03-22 02:14:55
You are completely right but nothing you said invalidates what I said.
Say BU forks off with the majority hash power. Even if the majority of miners run BU code, both BU and Bitcoin will likely agree on the same chain for a while. At some point a BU miner will mine a block that's bigger than 1 MB which is valid according to BU rules but invalid according to Bitcoin rules. At that point the transaction histories between the different coins differ from eachother.
However, from this point on, the two coins will have a different market price. As long as the Bitcoin chain has the higher market price, more miners will be incentived to mine Bitcoin than BU. So even if BU were to start off with more hashing power, at some point most miners are likely to switch over to mining the Bitcoin chain. If this were to happen, the entire BU history would eventually be orphaned, and the two coins would revert back to the same history.
The BU chain always runs the risk to be orphaned and replaced by the Bitcoin chain if the Bitcoin chain ever becomes the longest, whereas the Bitcoin chain doesn't, since the Bitcoin chain simply considers the BU chain to be invalid regardless of length.
@_date: 2016-01-20 14:40:46


Exactly like right now with the block size limit. Someone stirs up the debate, and scares the users into believing something is horribly wrong with coin cap (time this with an economic recession for maximum effect). They make another client and gets a few reputable persons behind it. You start to see a lot of posts on forums about how the cap must be raised and you basically force the unwashed masses to pick a side, even though they're not nearly competent to have an opinion on the matter. The side with the best PR wins.


Once again, it's not about the change. It's about how it's being conducted.




Yes there is. Bitcoin core currently defines Bitcoin in the case of an involuntary hard fork. If the network would split in two because of some obscure bug that caused a disagreement beteenden clients, and it's not obvious who needs to correct their code, then Bitcoin core is what decides the real chain from the wrong one. It's to keep consensus in a state of emergency.

By that logic p2sh is an altcoin since it was softforked into Bitcoin. If you actually want to be objective you have to differ between softforks and hardforks.

Seriously, Greg Maxwell and Adam Back are hard core old school Cypherpunks. Their entire lives speak well about their views on decentralization and privacy. Adam Back has been working on digital cash systems since 1990. He also worked on freedom net which is a precursor to TOR. And I don't think anyone has done more for cryptocurrency innovation than Greg Maxwell. I'd bet more than 50% of altcoins uses his innovations in one way or the other, whether they credit him with it or not. Coinjoin and confidential transactions together should give any libertarian a privacy boner. 
Mike Hearn came out of nowhere and his entire Bitcoin career consisted around controversial proposals that would compromise both privacy and fungibility of Bitcoin. How about address blavklists for law enforcement? Or what about connecting your passport to Bitcoin addresses? Great privacy centered ideas right? 
Anyone who trusted Mike Hearn over Maxwell and Back is either an idiot or doesn't have the ideals of privacy and decentralization at heart.
Not to mention that way more developers than those of Blockstream support the Core scalability road map.

I just now realize you are the OP of the thread. I thought you were the guy (curyous) who posted about how they would make a lot more money from sidechains than from "a few timelocked bitcoins".

And every one of your posts just seemed to avoid any answer to that.

The precedent this sets is really worrying actually. If we allow for someone to just make a hardfork client and let it become the dominant client by influence over popular opinion, we can pretty much guarantee it's going to happen again. That is a sure fire way that Bitcoin will end up in the hands of corporate interests some time in the future. 
@_date: 2016-01-15 04:03:24


The idea is to remove the incentive to double spend completely. So if you sell a cup of coffee to someone and then notice that this person tries to double spend you, you can make another transaction that relies on the first one that spends the entire amount to the miners. The miners will mine the two transactions that gives them the money, and the attacker doesn't gain anything, except a bad reputation at your store.
So the idea is basically that it's better if the attacker knows that the best thing he can accomplish is to pay the miners instead of paying you. Since the attacker loses out on any gain he won't even bother to double spend to begin with. I don't necessarily agree with this, but I still had to call you out on horribly misrepresenting the idea behind the change.

When people hype Ethereum, I find that the example use cases they give usually fall into one of two categories:
1. Things that are already possible with Bitcoin, but most people just don't know about it, and where general interest seem extremely weak when there isn't any money to make in hyping the use case. For example, decentralized exchanges.
2. Far out examples with extremely questionable economic viability even if they were to work. See DAO.

No they don't. A hardfork is basically an altcoin with a shared history with the original coin. It doesn't need majority hash power any more than any other altcoin.

Competition between companies are good. A currency is not a company however, so your analogy fails. Bitcoin is a standard for value transfer. Competition between standards usually doesn't solve any problems (as long as the standard is not completely unreasonable).
Would you argue that "competition" between the metric system and the imperial system is good? In reality they just add engineering costs when you have to transition between the two.
Competing languages add costs for trade across borders.
Would you argue for multiple incompatible internets? Should Apple create their own Internet (iInternet) to compete with the open standard? Would that improve or degrade the current utility of the Internet? 
The only thing that multiple currencies will accomplish is adding transaction costs for some economic transfers. That is a cost, not a gain. Bitcoin is close enough to the theoretical optimal money (in regards to divisibility, fungibility, scarcity, recognizability etc), that any meaningful competition is simply not possible.

Smaller and newer coins has always had bigger rallies and bigger dips. Nothing new here. Bitcoin is still going strong. 
@_date: 2016-01-02 12:33:46
Every banks first preference when it comes to cryotocurrency is that they create an altcoin and manages to convince ever other bank to accept it. However, all other banks have no real incentive to accept a coin that's premined by another actor. Second to this preference, a bank would prefer one global cryptocurrency that they didn't create, but still be among the first to buy/own/use it. 
So while the first is more preferable, it is also substantially more unlikely to pan out because of competition between many actors trying to accomplish the same thing. Bitcoin is still small enough that any bank could buy up a substantial amount of it. And if you're not going to use your own, you might make a bet on the most established one. 
So the incentive for the banks to settle on Bitcoin rather than their home made altcoin is that another bank may do it before them. The second best alternative is still way better than missing out on the crypto boom completely.

You don't need majority hash power for a hardfork. BU could fork right now, get a market price on their coin, and then they would get an amount of hash power that corresponds to the mining reward. So if you want a hardfork, go ahead and hardfork. No one is even able to stop that.

I never claimed that the white paper described protocol changes. So you can stop demanding proof for something I never said. 
I did say that using mining as votes on protocol changes is completely at odds with Satoshi's descriptions of a 51% attack. 
For example, here is one of the earliest posts ever from Satoshi. 
Satoshi wrote:


If miners decided protocol rules, then this statement would be completely false. A miner with 51% of the hashing power could then vote to do whatever he wanted (steal other people's coins, create unlimited coins foe himself etc). The fact that Satoshi describes a 51% attack as limited in scope to double spends shows that he intended miner votes to be limited to transaction ordering. It is the only way for his statements to be logically consistent. 
@_date: 2016-03-31 20:23:47
That part of the white paper is still only talking about the ordering of transactions. This is easily understood if you look at satoshis early descriptions of a 51% attack. If miners could change the protocol, then a 51% attack could completely destroy Bitcoin. This is not how satoshi described it. 
For example, here is one of the earliest posts ever from Satoshi, where he is answering questions about the white paper. 
Satoshi wrote:


If miners decided protocol rules, then this statement would be completely false. A miner (or group of miners) with 51% of the hashing power could then vote to do whatever he wanted (steal other people's coins, create unlimited coins foe himself etc).

The only thing we actually know about the profit motive of Blockstream is that they used time locked bitcoins in order to incentivize themselves to ensure Bitcoins success. Anything else and you are just guessing.
Their investors could also be heavily invested in Bitcoin, and may not expect any huge return in the near term from blockstream, but from their bitcoin holdings. Long term it's probably a very wise move to be on a good foot with a few of the people closest to Bitcoin development. A lot of silicone Valley companies don't even care about profits in their early years. They just want to get a good product because they know they can monetize on it later. This could be a similar move. My guesses are as valuable as yours. 
Jesus Christ, the guys you are talking about are old school cypherpunks that have been fighting for Internet freedom and cryptography their entire life. Adam Back was fucking mentioned in Satoshi's white paper. The cryptographic insight of Greg Maxwell continues to amaze me whenever I read something from him.

That's kind of the point. Segwit makes an increase to the blocksize limit uneccesary in the near future. This gives us time to implement technologies such as weak blocks and IBLT that reduces the centralization pressure that comes with bigger blocks. There's no point in increasing the blocksize limit before that unless absolutely necessary.

That's a bit backwards though. The biggest factor when it comes to miner profits is not fees, but Bitcoin price. If the price goes up, then all miners get a massive pay boost, at least until the new equilibrium is reached, and even then most of the new mining power would come from the already established miners.
Fighting against an improvement like segwit because they are afraid it allows secure off chain transaction seem really short sighted.

Your talk about competition among bitcoin clients makes no sense. Bitcoin is based on consensus rules. We can change the consensus through forks but by definition consensus is the opposite of competition. At any single point in time there can only be one set of consensus rules that is defined as Bitcoin. If Bitcoin classic were to hijack the reference client we still wouldn't have competition. We would just have a new set of rules defined as Bitcoin.

Not true. Hashpower can change the rules by themselves via a soft fork (not originally intended), but the rest of the community can make any change they want without mining support as long as the community agrees.
A hard fork is basically the community agreeing on creating a new altcoin that we all migrate to and calls the new Bitcoin. Miners simply follow the money, so if the "new" coin is more popular miners will follow the community and mine it. 
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:17:28
Imo any person with the knowledge should just go ahead and fork BU and be done with it.

No one on the dark net is using Ethereum to buy drugs. Bitpay aren't accepting monero. Venezuelans aren't using Litecoin to escape inflation.
It took Bitcoin maybe two years to start seeing some real world usage. Alts have existed for 5+ years at least and none of them have even made it that far yet. They are all still in the proof of concept and speculative phase. Bitcoin is really the only cryptocurrency. All alts are still just cryptos without the currency part.
@_date: 2016-01-29 19:51:24


Dramatic much?
First off, Segwit is already being tested. 
Second, the average block is currently about 0.8 Mb, and I would be willing to bet that segwit will be out before we're even close to 1 Mb. And even if blocks would get consistently full tomorrow the "train" would not "fall apart". Blocks would be full for a few months until we have segwit, that's it. People who pay the recommended fee on transactions will likely not even notice anything. If it goes on for a while the fee will start to increase slightly. 


And there are strong incentives to do so, especially for big actors who make a lot of transactions. It's also a fairly straightforward update for wallets. We will see a pretty big almost immediate gain from segwit, followed by a smaller continuous gain as people update their wallets. 


No we're not. It would at most slow down adoption slightly. That's not any reasonable definition of "a world of hurt".


Prove it! Centralization is already a concern with 2 pools at ~25%. It's not a major concern but definitely not something to completely disregard either.
But you seem very sure here, so show your calculations. 


If we're going to talk in analogies of trains falling apart, you're the one who is willing to risk exactly that because you're not patient enough to just go along in a steady safe pace. All I see is you screaming "Faster, faster, faster!" against the warnings of the people who actually built the train.

Bitcoin is a broadcast network and doesn't scale linearly like a server farm does. So raising the block size limit is not analogous. The tradeoffs are bigger, and a lot of the community feel like these tradeoffs are not worth it.
Your route would eventually destroy Bitcoin as we know it. 
Also, more than half the transactions are the same coins being spent more than ten times in the same block. Blocks are far from actually full.

Yes 2 MB seems like a reasonable limit today with a good safety margin as well. And segwit seems like the obviously superiour way to get 2 MB as it paves the way for better scaling and optimizations in more ways than just increased capacity (LN, it solves non-linear sig-ops, schnorr signatures etc).
@_date: 2016-01-29 18:44:26
Even if it doesn't break Bitcoin, the limit is not binary. There's no clear line where Bitcoin is broken on one side and unbroken on the other.
So while an increase to 2 Mb may not break Bitcoin completely it still adds to the centralization pressure. This pressure can however be mitigated by other improvements to Bitcoin. So why should we add any centralization pressure to Bitcoin at all before we implement the technologies that mitigate the risk when it's not even needed?
We will get segwit now that effectively increases capacity and buys us time to mitigate the centralization pressure of a block size limit hard fork. I see no logical reason to push through a hard fork now, when it will be safer to do it later, and segwit gives us the time to do it later.

I see four possible outcomes for whatever it is that R3 will actually produce. 
1. It's not a cryptocurrency at all. Rather, it's just a cryptographic platform of some sorts that allows smart contracts, settlements etc. Cool for them, but I doubt this will affect Bitcoin in any meaningful way. They are simply making a different thing. This is the most likely scenario as well imo. 
2. It's a severely crippled cryptocurrency. They want their own Bitcoin, but they want to control it. In this case, Bitcoin will still keep its competitive advantage. The bank will use their own coin, but Bitcoin development will continue, and over time the advantages of not crippling yourself will pan out. 
3. It's an actual open source fully functional cryptocurrency with no barriers to entry, but they make it inherently inflationary. This would probably initially be a pretty big hit to the value of Bitcoin, but Bitcoin would not die. Most banks and people would use the Bankcoin, but enthusiasts and ideologically driven people would continue with Bitcoin. A new type of wallet would emerge that stores Bitcoins and let's you exchange it to Bankcoins at the time of purchase. Over time, the value of Bitcoins will show to be continuously increasing towards Bankcoin because of deflationary pressures (although with big swings), which will drive more people to Bitcoin.
4. More or less a copy of Bitcoin. They even keep the deflationary aspects or have just very low inflation. They may add a few features and clean up a few things that are messy because of early mistakes. This would be a strong competitor to Bitcoin because of the massive support behind it, and Bitcoin offering no real advantage. But regardless of what would happen to the currency of Bitcoin here, it would still be a victory for the ideals behind it.
So what do you guys think? What could they reasonably come up with? 
@_date: 2016-03-08 02:34:24


The reason it's been working so well is because we've had a price floor on the fee. All really small value transactions had to choose between paying the minimum fee or the cost of waiting. This excluded all the really small value transactions from ever entering the network (such as I want to back up my music collection on the blockchain through billions of transactions). 
If you "want the market to handle it" you should logically argue for the removal of the price floor as well. Price floors lead to artificial reductions in demand. Let the market set the demand. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 14:58:40

It's proof that the demand for blockchain space at a low enough price is virtually unlimited though. I have a use case for about 4 TB of blockchain storage. It's just too expensive for me now. 
This unlimited demand can fill any block, regardless of size. You just fill the block with the top bidders. The reason this hasn't happened until now is that some of the top bidders were only prepared to pay less than the centrally planned minimum allowed. If we didn't have a price floor, then blocks would become full pretty quickly at any size.

Yes I got that much. First, do you have any idea what a sidechain is? If anything, this would be saving money for exchanges, and maybe their users. I'm not quite sure how Liquid is set up, but the fees of the network would be going to miners of some sort, not Blockstream. A sidechain is not some proprietary system for sale as you seem to imply.
Second, even if Blockstream would have offered this to exchanges as a pure service for sale rather than a sidechain, it doesn't seem to affect their incentives regarding bitcoin success at all. What's your logic here? "They are offering something to Bitcoin exchanges, clearly it's in their self interest to sabotage Bitcoin now."

The thing is it's not really that urgent. Bitcoin won't implode just because of blocks becoming full. If anything we would learn a little bit about how a fee market would pan out, and Joe usage would change if space becomes an issue, which could be valuable at a later time.
The only real threat is from an altcoin, but none of them is even close to Bitcoins market cap, usage and name recognition. It would take any coin years to get to where bitcoin is today. So we have years to solve this issue.

You could just as well define a cent as a USD and come to the conclusion that the USD is way stronger. The base unit is completely arbitrary. It's like comparing units of measurements. A meter is not a stronger unit of measurment than a foot just beacuse it's base unit happens to be longer. That's just an arbitrary choice.
Currency strength refers to its change in value over time. A stronger currency will not lose as much value over time and will hold its value better in economic crises.

How does securing your bitcoins protect you against torture to give up your bitcoins? For someone with enough money it might actually be preferable to not have complete control over it, as that would protect them somewhat against this attack.
And you think a passphrase protects you against every single attack vector? Do you seriously think it's literally impossible to get a passphrase from someone? All I'd have to do is to actually watch you type it one way or another.
Security is also not only about defending yourself against adversaries. What if you hit your head and forget your passphrase? Your bitcoins were secure enough against theft but not against accidental loss.
Nothing is 100% secure. You can secure bitcoins very very well though.

An account model isn't as simple as you would first think. In an account model, if you make a payment to me, there is nothing that stops me from replaying your transaction as many times as your account can afford.
Ethereum uses an account model. In order to deal with this they include a unique nonce with every transaction. But this reduces scalability as every new transaction has to be checked against ALL earlier transactions from that account to make sure it's not a copy. This also disrupts pruning as these nonces has to be stored in eternity or old transactions would become valid a second time.
There may be ways to make this more efficient, but you are still just trying to solve an issue that simply doesn't exist in a utxo model.
So the utxo model is anything but over engineered. It's actually the simplest solution to all the issues that arise in an account model. I'd say it's probably one of the more genius features of bitcoin. 
This is the main reason for bitcoins utxo model. In addition to this, there are significant privacy gains.

No. Satoshi clearly describes a system where miners only decide on the order of transactions in order to prevent double spends.


chain. Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such
as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are
not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block
containing them. **An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back
money he recently spent.**

There's a difference. The bug in Bitcoin meant that the Bitcoin protocol wasn't working as intended. The fix changed it back to the way everyone had agreed upon.
Ethereum is working as intended. The bug was in a smart contract, not in Ethereum itself. If you invest in a smart contract without vetting the smart contract first you have made a mistake. People simply didn't read the fineprint.
It's ironic, because the value of smart contract lies in that it removes the need to uphold contracts via force or human intervention. Now people want to use human intervention to fix a smart contract that didn't do what they wanted it to do. A smart contract that can be changed this way is actually just a regular contract with more overhead.

They may try uninstalling and reinstalling their client, maybe even deleting some folders. They might be trying to convert to a backup (that might not even be good because of a bad backup system). They may try to convert their wallet file to another client. They may start looking for their "private key" without any real understanding about what they are looking for. They may Google something that ends up leading them on the completely wrong track, resulting in them doing something even more obscure.
Sometimes when people do all of this bad stuff, they fuck themselves over even more and end up losing a lot of money.

So a 1 month grace period is really only a grace period for people who check up on bitcoin regularly like on this subreddit.

Segwit really only sounds complicated. The code is fairly straightforward. 


The code is far more reviewed than the Bitcoin classic code.


This is not really an objection against segwit. And it's a fairly weak argument for a blocksize increase (the argument is not technical at all). 


This is not really anything but an aesthetic issue. It's technically irrelevant, except for the fact that a soft fork is safer to implement.


This is an interesting objection that I hadn't seen before (the objection is just a few days old and merits some discussion). Note that he doesn't say it makes it any more dangerous than a hardfork though, just that it adds similar risks. However, any sensible person should await some more discussion on this among the devs before formulating an opinion. I do appreciate you bringing this to my attention attention though.

We reevaluate and make the best decision based on the curcumstances then. At that point we will have even more improvements rolled out, and more knowledge as basis for the decision. It will still likely be a compromise between the need for increased capacity and the need to not increase centralization pressures passed the point where Bitcoin losses the very thing that makes it valuable in the first place.
What you need to realize is that the limit is a safety limit based on real limitations. Imagine you have a bridge that will break if more than 100 tonnes of vehicles cross it at the same time. You would need to limit the amount and size of vehicles that cross it, and may put the limit to something like 80 tonnes. Your question is like asking "what should we do when we need more than 80 tonnes of vehicles to cross at the same time?" The answer is never to just increase the safety limit with complete disregard to what will break the bridge. You would have to improve the capacity of the bridge first. Likewise, we can't just increase the blocksize limit with complete disregard to what will break Bitcoin.
So bigger blocks is definitely better, but not crossing the breaking point is the first priority. If we just increase the limit every time we reach it, hoping we won't break Bitcoin every time, then at some point we definitely will. Development based on wishful thinking over science would inevitably kill Bitcoin. Therefore, block size increases have to be preceeded by studies and peer review that prove that they are safe.

And then people and companies will start to effectivize their use of block space. Not too long ago Coinbase made two blockchain transactions for every user transactions. Fees made them change that. A huge amount of companies and people are still using Bitcoin in a very inefficient and wasteful way. One of the bigger examples currently is wasteful mixing practises, but that's just an example. We could still achieve many of the same goals with less blockchain load, just by being smarter. The fees are forcing people to be smarter, which is a long term good thing, even if it may cause a few annoyances.
The best indicator to how much better we could be at utilizing blockspace is probably the transactions-ecxluding-long-chains stat. Total daily transactions hasn't increased much in the past year, but daily transactions excluding long chains have almost doubled. That's a great improvement, and still doesn't even make up 50% of total transactions. So there is still lots of room for improvement here.

It's also not an either or scenario. It's far more likely to be a gradual transition. The trust for the financial system and the government goes down the drain. Some people start accepting bitcoins since they prefer that over their national currency. The number of people paying in Bitcoin is still so few that they can easily save the few coins they earn. They receive enough fiat to not have any issue with paying taxes. In a few years time other people see that those that accepted bitcoins were more successful than those that didn't, so they start copying them. And the snowball rolls on.

Yeah, it definitely is. It's also a tactic that's been used by the Bitcoin Classic/Unlimited/Extreme crowd for far longer against Bitcoin Core and its developers. Pointing fingers at scapegoats turned out to be a very effective tactic to gain followers, which is probably why both sides has now adopted it.
I don't condone it, but it's interesting. When only the Classic crowd used this tactic they seemed to be winning the political fight. It wasn't until the Core crowd stooped to the same level and started pointing fingers at Ver and Jihan that the playing field seemed to even out. The vast majority of people doesn't seem interested in or capable enough to judge the technical arguments by their merits.

This is more like it. But this is just the initial case as all bitcoins and 2x-coins start belonging to the same address. This will change over time. If you carefully create two seperate transactions, one on each chain, and transmit them at the same time, then your coins are likely to end up at one address at one chain, and at another address on the other chain. If you fail and they end up at the same address you can just try again.
So splitting the coins will be a lot trickier, but it's entirely possible.

Savings is not a binary phenomenon. All money is saved. At any single instance all money is part of someones cash holdings.
The difference is for how long it is saved. Some money is saved for 10 years, some money is saved for 10 days. Bitcoin makes sense for savings when the cost of inflation is higher than the transaction costs of going in and out of Bitcoin. Thus, the higher the inflation rate or the expected loss of holding fiat is, the stronger the incentives for holding bitcoins. If the cost of holding fiat is high enough, it makes perfect sense to have even your day to day money in Bitcoin.

This has always seemed a bit dangerous to me, as it seems like the long term implications are that 51% of miners really can decide everything about Bitcoin. It's [Bitcoin Extreme]( only for real.
I mean, imagine a future where states decide that Bitcoin needs to be inflationary. They could just force miners to go through with a "soft hardfork" where the coinbase transaction is increased. Everyone can either go along with the change or be forced to stop using Bitcoin, as the old blocks are basically 51% attacked to be completely empty. Everything can be changed with this method, against the will of the users.
The very existence of this possibility changes the incentives in Bitcoin completely. I consider this a big security risk.

That is still wrong. The limit is increased, but it isn't a fixed limit anymore. It's still 1 MB for old type of transactions, but it's up to 4 MB with segwit in the optimal case.

The goals we choose are subjectively chosen. But once we have decided on a goal, then any proposal can be objectively evaluated on how well it achieves that goal.
If we subjectively determine that survival is good and worth pursuing, then eating food is objectively good, and eating poison is objectively bad. Any compromise on this will leave you objectively dead.
The point is that the very act of compromising always lead to suboptimal solutions. If you have two ideas that are both good and aren't competing with eachoter, then you don't need to compromise. You could put forward both ideas seperately and evaluate them independently. In the best case, compromise only leads to a suboptimal solution, and in the worst case it has disastrous effects.

That would be a hardfork then, no?

They wouldn't even need the majority of the hashing power. If one miner created an invalid block, then that chain would have a block length of the regular chain +1.

But a blockchain of fiat needs to be backed by someone i.e. there has to be some centralized entity that says "this blockchain token is worth x USD, and I promise to always buy and sell it at this price". If a regular bank creates such a token then you need to trust this bank to not go bankrupt etc. and then they might as well just use web site tokens of some sort.
A fiat blockchain would make some sort of sense if it was created by a central bank. Everyone who uses fiat already implicitly put some trust into the central bank, so a central bank blockchain token wouldn't add any more centralized trust than already exists.

But how are non miners supposed to enforce the original chain against 51%+ of miners?
Say all miners softfork to add a new rule that dissallows any address with the letter 'A' in it (say because of a government mandate). This would still be a completely valid chain for all the old nodes (although very statistically unlikely), so how are old nodes supposed to enforce the old rules when the miners aren't even breaking them?
@_date: 2016-12-05 17:05:02


That's not necessarily true.
What if 10% of the network switched as well, but those 10% are among the most influental and powerful nodes? Would it be safe enough then? What if the softfork had strong government backing making it very unlikely to ever be reversed?
I don't think it's that hard to construct scenarios where the softfork would be deemed safe enough in many cases, especially if users are offered preferential treatment from the miners to offset the risks.


Or potentially permanent.
Soft forks are just a tool to make changes to Bitcoin easier than with a hard fork. Just like a hardfork could be bad, a softfork could be bad. My point is that the existence of soft forks make hostile changes easier to achieve than if they had to go through the hard fork process. Do you disagree with this?

You get that with segwit.
Even Toomims own calculations showed that we are in dangerous territory with a block size limit around 3-4 MB. This mean that we could have either the segwit increase or the hard fork increase. But with both we are dangerously close to the limit. Considering all the other benefits of segwit, the choice between the two is a nobrainer.
Hopefully we'll be able to mitigate some of the risks of higher block sizes which will allow even bigger blocks in the future, but as it stands now, that would be dangerous and the health of the network will always go before the capacity of the network. It doesn't matter how many people want a unicorn. If it isn't possible, we will have to deal with what we have.

It's not central planning though. Central planning implies force. There is a big difference between "central planning" and "centralized decision making".
Real capitalists aren't against central decision making. They know that is the work of the entrepreneur. The strength of the markets over governments don't come from the absence of centralized decision makers. It comes from the fact that the decision makers are competing with each other, and good decision makers are rewarded by profits, and bad decision makers are punished by losses.
By the way you are using the term "central planning", one would think you want companies to be run by their workers as well. The CEO making the decisions is "centralized decision making" as well after all. So read some Mises and GTFO here with your Newspeak.

One of the biggest myths of modern economics is that consumption causes growth. In reality, it's underconsumption (savings) that causes growth. It's simple opportunity cost. Any resource that goes towards consumption can't go towards improving production. Natural resources that becomes consumption goods can't become new machines and factories. Labour and time that is spent to create the consumption goods can't be spent to improve the production line. Energy that is spent for consumption purposes can't be used for productive purposes.
It's only by not consuming that you can free up some resources and use them towards improving production. This is easy to see if you look at an individual level. The individual that consumes his entire paycheck every month will never grow his personal economy. The individual that consumes less than he earns, will start to accumulate money each month, and start earning interest on that. Eventually, he will find himself in a position where his total consumption throughout his lifetime actually increases. Anything he doesn't consume today, he can consume tomorrow + interest.

Bitcoin development can't be a sequence of compromises, because you can always move the goal posts for the next compromise. If we were to raise the limit to 2 MB because of political pressure, then some people would immediately propose a 16 MB increase in order to have some negotiating room for the next compromise.

Sure, these softforks could be dropped if the miners change their mind. But what if the majority of miners has a strong reason to not want to (for example, say it would give them a prison sentence)? Then the users would simply have to live with the softfork, even if they would prefer the non forked alternative, right? Unlike hardforks, there is no way for users and nodes to push the nonfork rules on miners that don't want it. This gives the miners more power than ideal.


I don't think I've said anything that indicates otherwise.


Not if they know that the majoirty of miners still uphold the no 'A' rule (say because of a strong external pressure such as government regulation). A rational minority miner would disregard an "A-block" even if he finds it valid, as he knows it will eventually be orphaned. Any work spent on this block will be wasted.
From the perspective of "old" nodes and miners this looks like a 51% attack. From the perspective of "new" miners, they are simply disregarding an invalid block. Nontheless, both perspectives will eventually converge to the same chain, the one with the new rules.

I know enough about segwit so there's no need to be patronizing.
Segwit seperates the signatures from the rest of the transaction data. That's it in a nutshell. All of the data still has to be included in the blocks, it's just structured diffetently.
In the end, the only way to fit &gt;1 MB of data in a block is to have a &gt;1 MB limit. It takes some really creative mental acrobatics to argue otherwise.

You're moving the goal posts. Your original claim was that you don't consider segwit to be a block size increase. The fact of the matter is without segwit, no block can be above 1 MB in size. After segwit it can. That is an increase. 
Yes, segwit also changes how the limit is calculated, so it's not a fixed limit anymore. But we have enough data to tell that the limit will be close to 2 MB for a block filled with typical transactions. Since 2&gt;1 that is a block size limit increase by definition.

It's the principle, not the amount. If an exchange owes you another crypto when Bitcoin is forked, then they must owe you any fork. This becomes unmanageable, so the only logically consistent position is that they are not obligated to give you forked coins. Whenever they do give you a forked coin you can consider it a bonus.
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:31:37


That would be fraud. 


The problem with this is that it opens up a way to dos attack exchanges. It's easy to make hundreds of forks of Bitcoin, and if the exchanges are obligated to support them, anyone could force an exchange to expend their developer resources.
The only way to resolve this dos attack is to set the precedent that you are owed bitcoins and nothing else. Anything you get for free from the exchange is just a bonus, but they never owed it to you.

Arbitraging required someone to sell BTC at gox, and withdraw the fiat to buy at another exchange, which was impossible at the time. The buying pressure caused by their fiat issues was isolated to gox and had no way to spread to other exchanges.
If anything, people who wanted to get fiat out of gox needed to buy BTC from them and sell it at another exchange, causing a downward pressure on the other exchanges.

The problem here is that there's no absolute definition of a bubble. By your definition of a bubble, Bitcoin definitely qualifies. But if someone, among other things, has the criteria that a bubble is an overvalued asset, then Bitcoin doesn't necessarily qualify. Bitcoin could very well still be a good positive expected value bet even at today's prices. If there's a 2%+ chance that Bitcoin overtakes gold as a store of value, then Bitcoin is still undervalued.

No, that creates a local upwards pressure on gox only, which was the cause of the price difference between gox and the other exchanges. 
In order for the upwards pressure to spread from one exchange to another, you need an arbitrage opportunity which wasn't possible because of the gox fiat withdrawal problems.

They're mostly just diluting each other. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that's not an altcoin. The more altcoins there are, the more options are there for the altcoin believers to divide their capital between, but bitcoin believers just sees each fork as some free coins they can sell for more bitcoins.
I think this is the reason segwit2x was canceled (along with some pretty big profits from insiders shorting the futures). The people behind it realized it would just split the hardfork userbase and efforts between segwit2x and Bcash. But the cat's out of the bag. There will be more hardforks, and each one is just another option for altcoin believers, ultimately diluting the investments in the others.

It's worse than that. It gives the power over the entire protocol to the highest bidder. You don't need to be a miner, you just need to pay the current miners through transaction fees. If you make transactions with enough fees to make the new chain more profitable than the original chain, it's pretty much guaranteed to have more hashing power. 
Currently, there's 10 million USD worth of BTC being mined each day. That's all you need to pay\* in order to buy the Bitcoin name and complete control over the protocol according to Coinbase. Do that for however long is necessary to deem the new coin a winner, and if enough people accept your reasoning, then you just stole the Bitcoin brand. This doesn't really line up well with the ideals of crypto.
 \*That's the absolute most you need to pay. In reality you only need to pay the difference between the profitability of the old and new chain. If you combine this with good timing with a dip in the Bitcoin price and some market manipulation you can probably get away with doing it a lot cheaper.

Trading is a zero sum game (compared to just holding the underlying asset). In order to profit on trading you need some kind of edge, and focus on that. What edge do you have when you're trading against insiders?
Look at what happened to B2X. A few insiders could profit massively by shorting the B2X futures before announcing that the fork wasn't going to happen. A huge amount of non-insiders got burned massively on that, and there was nothing they could do to protect themselves.
Basically, it doesn't matter if you understand what's happening. You are still the underdog. You have partial information and are trading against people with full information.

Note that this is opposite to your original statement. You said fiat fleeing gox through BTC, caused an upward pressure on price. This is BTC entering gox that gets that effect. Money fleeing gox via BTC caused an oversupply of BTC on other exchanges. BTC entering gox to bet on their recovery caused an undersupply of BTC outside of gox. Both things surely did happen, but more people certainly fled gox than was attracted to them, or the price disparity wouldn't have occurred. Thus, the net effect was still a downward pressure on other exchanges.

Well, I acknowledged that it's way more private in both my posts. I'm well aware of stealth addresses and confidential transactions.
But what do you mean there's no good reason that I don't know A? In cryptography you should always assume the worst. There are plenty of ways someone could know A. For example, an exchange could be selling data or give in to government pressure to just give it up for free.


I'd be interested to know where you get that exact number from. I don't think you need to completely anonymize the blockchain to find anything useful. A very resourceful organization such as a country's intelligence agency could probably make a lot of probable inferences if they had access to enough data from a few exchanges or similar where they could connect transactions to metadata.

That's part of it, but not all. Some people even have massive influence on the future of specific cryptos, and they can still trade freely on exchanges. They can purposely short their own crypto and then make a bad decision wiping out tons of leveraged longs, only to then reverse their decision once traders has adjusted to the new information.
We've seen this time and time again. The cancellation of the B2X fork is just one example. A few people could single handedly make the future lose 80%+ of its value with one decision. Surely they took advantage of that and profited massively. The segwit implementation in Litecoin is another example where a few miners announced and withdrew their support multiple times, most likely in order to profit from the price swings.
It's impossible to find an edge in a market like this unless you're one of the insiders or people with direct influence. Any edge you do have is completely dwarfed by the edge described above. Thus, the only rational thing to do is to avoid short term trading completely.

The only coin that can compete is Monero, and it has trade offs. Monero is more private, but at scalibility trade offs (bigger and unprunable transactions).
What a lot of people are missing is that most of the real cryptographic work is still going on in the Bitcoin sphere, and the Bitcoin road map is way better than anything that exists in any altcoin currently. Things like schnorr signatures, signature aggregation, MAST, confidential transactions, Mimblewimble and bulletproofs. Those are the biggest cryptocurrency innovations in the past few years, and they were all developed by Bitcoin devs, or people who seem to strongly sympathize with the Core side of the debate.
That makes me very confident that Bitcoin is still the cryptocurrency of the future. Most people just don't seem to realize that real cryptography takes a lot of time, way more time than regular programming.
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:00:13
My comment only concerns short term trading. I really think it's incredibly stupid to be trading any cryptocurrency. Whatever edge you might have, there's no way it will be big enough to make up for the inside info that exchanges and influental people have.
Holding is different though. You don't need an information edge in order to see the potential of Bitcoin. If you believe in crypto, then buying for the long term can be a good bet, but I'd strongly advise against any trading in an unregulated market such as crypto. That is a zero-sum game and you are very likely to be on the wrong side of the zero.

The calculation was cherry picked and simplified to make the point that it's entirely possible, at least in theory, that Bitcoin is both currently undervalued and might crash in a bubble like way in the near future. I wanted to make the point that short term volatility is irrelevant to Bitcoin's actual value, which imo can only be determined based on its chances of success.
So the percentage doesn't represent my actual assumptions. I just wanted to show the principle.
In reality, the calculation gets far more complicated. You have to estimate a probability distribution of all possible future scenarios, and estimate a valuation for bitcoins in each case. Still, making rough back of the napkin calculations is, at least as far as I can tell, the only rational way to determine some kind of fundamental value of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-10-10 19:18:08
No, I'm correct here.
Monero uses ring signatures which basically means that every transaction has one real and multiple fake inputs. This is obfuscation, not concealment, just as I said. 
Basically, a Bitcoin transaction looks like this in the blockchain:
A -&gt; X
And a Monero transaction looks like this:
A, B, C or D -&gt; X
If I know A belongs to you, I now know you made a transaction to X with 25% probability.
Monero is most definitely a big improvement in terms of privacy, but potential for blockchain analysis is still not completely eliminated.

As I said, this is only true if you ignore FX fees. Sure, people are wrong when they say it ended up costing whatever the future value will be.

Capitalism only really gives a competetive advantage to exchanges that give out the *value *of a forked currencies to their users. Wether you want the exchange to give you the forked currency directly or sell the currency and give you the proceeds is really up to personal preference. Some people would prefer to be given the other currency, whereas others who don't care much for altcoins may see it as a provided service to not have to sell the coin themselves.
There's no real reason to believe that Bitmex will get a worse price than you would, although transparency could be an issue. But we can agree that exchanges that don't give out anything at all after a fork are at a big competetive disadvantage.

So the failure scenario you're describing is that something else simply gets more popular? So the future you're imagining is one where Bitcoin was the most popular crypto for ten years and then something else simply became more popular and took over. What prevents that currency to be overtaken in another ten years then?
If cryptocurrency relies on popularity rather than incentives, then the entire concept seems pretty doomed to me. If Bitcoin is overtaken then the next crypto can be overtaken as well. If the leading crypto is going to change every ten years, then it seems like a pretty shitty store of value, and I have a hard time seeing how it can compete with fiat currencies which can exist for hundreds of years.
Bitcoin functions because of the incentives of network effects. People use it because it is the most used cryptocurrency, and the more people that use it, the more utility it gets, which makes it harder to break out of the network. It's a self-strengthening phenomena. This is the reason it is so hard to break the monopoly of fiat, even though it's relatively simple to provide a better product. Everyone is incentivized to use fiat out of convenience, because everyone is already using fiat.

They will definitely exchange at a 1:1 ratio sine you can create sidechaincoins with bitcoins and vice versa. Or maybe it's better to say a fixed ratio, but that's just a question of denomination.
Since they are interchangeable on a protocol level, any divergence in price creates an arbitrage opportunity. If the price were to differ from the fixed ratio, you could make free money by turning bitcoins into sidechaincoins, or the other way around. 
This makes sidechains into something like a bitcoin-backed altcoin, with new exciting properties, but with the value of bitcoins.

Not from an EV perspective. The only thing that matters from an EV perspective is the current price and the probability distribution of all possible futures.
For example, say Bitcoin has a 4% chance of overtaking gold in its role as a store of value/monetary safehaven within 10 years, and 96% chance of total failure. Then the expected value could be calculated as follows:
In 10 years:
(8 trillion*0,04)/21 million=~15238
We can discount this by 5% per year to get a good price for today:
x*1,05^10 = 15238
Basically, with the above assumptions, it would be a good long term bet to buy bitcoins at anything below 9238 USD.
Under the above assumptions, if people are buying just because people buy, they are simply making a good bet for a bad reason. They could very well start selling tomorrow, which would mean they are making a bad bet for a bad reason. This would definitely be a bubble like behavior, but I'd still argue that it's possible that Bitcoin is undervalued throughout the entire process. So if your definition of a bubble includes the criteria that the object needs to be overvalued, Bitcoin wouldn't qualify under the above assumptions.

Ideally, the miners should be incentivized to to what's best for Bitcoin. This vulnerability breaks that. Suddenly miners are incentivized to block certain upgrades, most notably segwit.

Not only that. If not all miners use ASICBOOST it actually decreases the network security. It's safe to assume that an attacker wouldn't care about the patents, which means that if he uses ASICBOOST, he can get a bigger share of the networks total hashing power for the same amount of money.

Bayes theorem describes how to properly update our probability of an event given new evidence or a new event.
[This]( is the best explanation I've seen and I'm just going to take the example that is used there. I really recommend reading the whole thing though.


Human intuition can be pretty bad at estimating the updated probabilities. The answer to the above question is 7.8%. That's because the pool of women without breast cancer is so much larger than the pool of women with breast cancer, so even if the chance of a false positive is small, there's so many chances for them to occur that they still outnumber the real positives.
That situation is similar to what we have going on with Craig Wright. The pool of people ready to claim that they are Satoshi outnumbers the real Satoshi vastly, and the chance that Satoshi would behave like Craig is slim to begin with, so someone seeking attention and claiming to be Satoshi is really weak evidence of that being the case. There's even an argument to be made that Craig's behavior is evidence against him being Satoshi.

The point about payment channels is that you only need to make 2 on chain transactions for an unlimited amount of micropayments. So micropayments aren't prohibited by any fees assuming you make enough of them (which is kind of the point of them anyways, to make many small payments as you go rather than one big payment). 
@_date: 2019-04-14 10:20:41


To be fair, I think the odds of any random person behaving like CSW is also very inflated in the calculations. But yeah, even with some extremely charitable estimations in Craigs favor, the numbers still wouldn't support us believing he is Satoshi.
Also, the reason we can even update our probabilities is because we assume there's a difference in expected behavior between Satoshi and non-Satoshi in this regard. 
We assume one conditional probability on Satoshi behaving like CSW and another conditional probability on any random person behaving like CSW. The bigger the difference of these probabilities, the stronger the evidence is. If there's no difference at all then his behavior shouldn't change our beliefs in the slightest.
We could compare this to other potential evidence, such as someone signing a message with a private key known to belong to Satoshi. Although it's not impossible that someone has managed to compromise satoshis keys, nor that Satoshi has lost them, the probability that Satoshi has access to them is much higher than the probability that a random person has them. This disparity in probability is what constitutes the strength of the evidence.

No one currently knows the full extent of the centralization pressures that come with bigger block sizes. You are completely ignoring the other side of the issue. Please show your 100 MB block size simulation that makes you so sure that increasing transaction volume by that much is easy. 


We still need a gradual transition. Are you just hoping and praying that we have enough users by the time the subsidy gets too small? It's way easier to increase the block size than to reduce it if necessary. So being conservative is in place here, or you might cause irrevocable damage to the way Bitcoin works. 


Yes I am in favor of a block size increase (very few people want 1 MB forever). It has to happen conservatively and with experiments and data to back up the safety of it though. And there is definitely no rush to do it. Too small blocks are way preferable than too big blocks.

The expense of the individual would be the same in this scenario. He would have his coins either destroyed or stolen. The coins are destroyed to protect the purchasing power of individuals who store their coins securely, and in order to not benefit the thieves. 


There are a lot of implicit agreements when you use Bitcoin. The 21M limit would be one of them. No one has signed a contract that the limit should never be raised, yet it is a fundamental agreement of the system. Security upgrades against systemic risks is another one of those agreements. For example, most would agree on not changing the POW algorithm. This is a fundamental part of how the system works. This is unless SHA-256 is deemed to be unsafe. If it is, then most everyone would agree to change the algorithm in order to secure the system. 
This issue is similar. The destruction of coins is a forbidden part of the Bitcoin agreement in any normal circumstances. But if it becomes necessary in order to protect the system against systemic risk, and if everyone affected has an easy way to avoid it, then there is no reason not to do it. You can't say it's absolutely forbidden since noone has actually signed any contract to join Bitcoin.

The extra block space is reserved to those who use segwit transactions. Anyone who thinks we have a issue "right here right now" can just upgrade themselves and start using the extra block space immediately. If anyone avoids upgrading it's probably not a big issue for them.


That's not how network effect works.


Very much in a low margin environment. Say you spend 95 USD for every 100 USD mined. A 30% cost reduction would give a huge increase in profits, and more importantly, this will go on as long as no one else uses ASICBOOST. Meanwhile a price increase has a very temporary effect as the only thing that will happen is that mining will reach a new equilibrium.

You leak information on the Bitcoin network as well, and a well connected node probably gets the origin of a transaction right most of the time. If intelligence agencies are datamining on the Bitcoin network, they can probably draw a scary amount of conclusions from their data already. "Prolly"
The difference with LN is that you can choose who you connect to, and that most of your activities aren't publicly visible for everyone. The same measures to hide your IP in a regular bitcoin transaction, could be made in a LN transaction. But yeah, additional privacy measures are necessary, but hiding your transactions from public view certainly seems like a good step.

Proof of work had only one original purpose, to vote on the order of transactions to prevent double spending. This is made obvious by satoshi multiple times when he explains the 51% attack. He clearly states that even if an attacker has 51% of the hashing power, they can't change the protocol in malicious ways (such as giving themselves unlimited amount of coins, or stealing coins). A 51% attack has always only been about one thing, double spending (ie changing the order of transactions).
Later, people realized that 51% of the hashing power could be used as a clever hack to change the protocol through soft forks as well. But that was never originally intended.

Math looks good to me.
We can take it all the way. With those assumptions there would be 0.8 real satoshis for every 720 million fake satoshis (0.096*7.5 billion) behaving like CSW. The numbers are obviously not real, but the point should be clear.
So the probability of CSW actually being Satoshi did increase with our new evidence, but only from 1 out of 7.5 billion to 1 out of 900 million (720 million / 0.8). The mistake people often do when they don't apply Bayesian reasoning is that they seem to replace old probabilities with new probabilities. New evidence pushes the probability in one direction, but it doesn't replace it. The prior probability is just as important as the strength of the new evidence. Here we have a low prior probability and fairly weak evidence with a lot of false positives.

The thing is, it won't have. Because if enough people decide to switch to another pow, then the old coin will become unprofitable to mine. Whereas the new coin will very soon be secured by millions of cpus/gpus as bitcoin were in the beginning.
Value of a coin doesn't come from hashing power (as long as it has enough to be safe against a 51% attack). Hashing power follows the value of a coin. A more valuable coin gets more hashing power, not the other way around.

My view is that monetarily, Bitcoin's properties are extremely close to optimal. In terms of durability, divisibility, recognizability, portability or scarcity, it's pretty much impossible for Bitcoin to become much better. The only monetary property where Bitcoin could improve in any meaningful way is in terms of fungibility, but it's already pretty damn good on that point as well.
I think a lot of altcoin pumpers miss this fact. Bitcoin is simply such good money already, that I don't believe any alt could outcompete it without being as revolutionary as Bitcoin was when it was released. The monetary properties of Bitcoin are simply so good, that technical differences between cryptocurrencies are extremely minor in comparison.
So even if Bitcoin never changed, it would still remain very close to optimal money. It could be somewhat better technically, but I really don't think this matters that much long term. If we could only solve transaction malleability and allow good scaling layers such as LN (the good version), then I wouldn't mind if Bitcoin never changed again. In fact, I'd even favor changes that made protocol updates even harder to achieve. I believe Bitcoin really is the TCP/IP protocol of future money. It may not be optimal by any measure, but it's simply so close that all potential changes are simply more hassle than they are worth.

You don't understand what is meant by "not working" here. Dynamic block size limits can work in the sense that they can exist. That's obvious, and they do exist in some alts. The issue is that all presented proposals are trivially gameable, and their long term equilibrium assuming profit maximizing miners is pretty much identical to no block size limit at all. That's what people mean when they say it doesn't work.
At least try to understand what people mean before you make yourself look silly again.

The fact that Bitcoin is hard to change is one of its biggest strengths. What we should do is figure out how to get the most important changes (segwit, sidechains) in before Bitcoin grows too big to change at all. After that we can just sit back and marvel at every failed attempt to change Bitcoin that makes it even stronger.

You lock them to the payment network in order to get the benefits of instant confirmations and higher privacy. As long as the node you're connected to is online you can still use your Bitcoins via the payment network. If however, that node goes down you would have to wait for a preset period of time to be able to use your bitcoins elsewhere.
So it's all about weighing the pros of instant confirmations and privacy vs the con of potentially not being able to access your bitcoins for a while. However, competition between payment network nodes will likely minimize the risk of nodes going down, as it's in their business interests to be reliable.

1 ASICBOOST is not a more efficient POW. It's a way to skip doing some of the work.
2 More importantly, ASICBOOST works best by sometimes creating empty blocks. I do think miners have the right to create empty block, but incentivizing it for no reason at all is incredibly unecessary and stupid.
3 Most importantly, it's incompatible with many proposed upgrades to the Bitcoin protocol. The most notable one would be segwit, but it also blocks crucial upgrades for SPV wallets. It basically blocks any update that would require a commitment in the block header, such as:
1. Segwit.
2. UTXO commitments. (non-delayed)
3. Committed Bloom filters
4. Committed address indexes
5. STXO commitments (non-delayed)

This is very simplistic. The miners could make a fortune by shorting bitcoins, or they could be paid by competitors to attack bitcoin. They could also be coerced by a government entity.
Yes, we do need to trust miners to some degree, but this trust can and should be minimized as much as possible. Simply brushing of the issue of miners attacking Bitcoin just by saying "they don't have the incentive" is not the right mindset to have when designing cryptosystems.

I agree with your main point, but I will never want to go back to reversible transactions. Reversibility adds overhead which costs money. There is no way around it. This cost is simply uneccesary for most of everyday transactions. It's more economical to simply accept the loss every now and then when you're not happy with a purchase, than to pay an extra percentage on every single transaction you make. That will add up to enormous sums over a lifetime that I am more than happy to not have to pay.
The exception being of course really large purchases were I would prefer some sort of escrow or other insurance that I won't get screwed over.

I don't think so. We are talking different kind of nodes here. A payment network node is not a regular Bitcoin node (at least not necessarily) and vice versa.

4. Demand and transaction volume is not the same thing, so my point stands. Price is the real measurement of demand (at zero cost, the demand for free data storage with externalized costs is virtually unlimited). So with a constant amount of transactions, increased demand would be shown by more efficient use of blockspace and increased fees.

My point is that short cuts doesn't make the network more secure, because the same short cuts are availible for potential attackers. The ideal POW should be as simple as possible to both perform and validate. Now it turns out that the protocol had an unintended short cut which means that one hash didn't represent the amount of work most people believed it did.

The risk of a contentious hard fork come from those who apply political pressure in order to get a contentious hard fork.
I ask you again, should we bend to political pressure every time we close in on the block size limit? Because the pressure will definitely be there, and after all, the risks can be argued to be "roughly understood" every time.
A well planned hard fork may be way less dangerous than a contentious one. But a hard fork that comes from political pressure rather than technical merits sets a rally dangerous precedent that could be way more dangerous long term.

I don't think you understand economic theory.
At a cost of 0 demand for a good is always infinite. It's important to realize that cost and price is not the same thing though. If something can't be utilised anymore at a price of 0, it's because the good has other costs associated to it, such as storage cost, transaction costs, or simply the cost of it just being a waste of time etc.
When costs are 0 there are no limits on how you can use a resource. If energy had a cost of 0 I would like to build my own planet somewhere. If blockchain space had a cost of 0 I would backup Terabytes of data on it, and maybe create the Blockchain equivalent of Youtube. Hell, I might even store as many digits of pi as possible in the blockchain just for fun. That right there would require an infinite amount of blockspace just to satisfy my personal demand.

This is not true. Any increase in block size increases the centralization to some degree. 1.1 MB would become slightly more centralized than 1 MB in the long run.

They don't control price, only difficulty (and to a very limited degree and with a considerable time lag that gets prolonged if miners drop out). 
My point is that if the users of a cryptocurrency to a large extent agrees on changing the pow, then the value of the coin will be with the new pow. CPU and GPU miners will flock to the coin with the altered pow as it will be highly profitable, whereas the price of the coin without users wiki tank to such a degree that pretty much all mining is a complete waste.
Thought experiment, say almost all businesses and users of bitcoin decides to change to the Litecoin algorithm (the hard fork also lowers the difficulty from current levels to say the same difficulty of Litecoin). Pretty much every Litecoin Miner would switch to Bitcoin immediately as Bitcoin is worth so much more and the profits would be crazy for a short while (until the difficulty adjusts to a level that is suitable for Bitcoins price rather than litecoins). The new network would almost instantly become the most secure cryptocurrency. At the same time, all miners who stay on the old algorithm are simply wasting energy to get a token that barely anyone uses. Soon some of them will start to shut down and the confirmation times will increase, prolonging the difficulty decreases that they need.
The only issue is to actually get people to change the pow. But a united community has all the power over the miners. They can't do shit if they try to abuse their power and the community decides they really want to get rid of them.

There is a difference between doing the same calculations faster, and finding a way to skip some of the calculations. It's called proof of work, not proof of result.

That would be devastating to miners regardless. Let's assume Bitcoin and classiccoin split in two and each get 50% of the original value. No chaos happens and everyone simply exchanges their coins to their preferred type. Classic supporters trade their split bitcoins into classiccoins and vice versa. We now have to crypto currencies valued at about ~200 USD each.
However, miners can still only mine on one coin at a time, and the difficulty has not changed. The miners have basically cut their revenues in half for the time being, until the long term catches up and the difficulty adjusts to the new reality (which could take a while if unprofitable miners drop out).
All of this assumes a "clean" split. If we assume the total value of both coins plummets then the effect gets even worse.

I think escrow is inherently different from reversible transactions, so it's not really what I was criticizing. That is a killer app for any transaction where there is a time delay until the good or service is delivered to you, or when transfer of ownership takes time. It's useful if you buy a house, car or even an airplane ticket. But it's not really practical or necessary for everyday transactions.

Assuming no external effects yes (in this case the short cut has effects such as incentivizing smaller blocks and making miners biased on certain protocol issues, both of those effects likely have some security implication).

It was an analogy. You don't get instant confirmations on the bitcoin blockchain layer, but on the LN layer (ie immediately irreversible paymebts). The moment you receive a transaction you have full certainty that the sender can't screw you over. Closing and setting up channels will require regular bitcoin confirmations, but once a channel is set up you can trust all payments through that channel immediately.
You can call this pre-confirmarions if you want, since the transaction isnt settled on the blockchain yet. But for all intents and purposes it's the same as an instant transaction on the blockchain, as you are cryptographically guaranteed to settle that transaction on chain.

This is just a horrible misrepresentation of the issue. Noone is seizing funds. We are demanding that you make **one** transaction to a safe adress for the sake of securing the system against a systemic risk. The benefit is for everyone involved (except potential thieves). Why are you arguing about the right to store your coins insecurely? 
The suggestion would provide a grace period that allows everyone affected to move their coins to a safe adress. You talk as if the goal of the suggestion is to confiscate purchasing power from individuals. The goal is to secure the purchasing power of everyone by not allowing the resurfacing of lost coins, and at the same time giving everyone plenty of time to make sure they aren't affected. If you want to keep your coins, just make a transaction to a safe adress. Can you give one rational reason why you would keep your coins in an adress where they could be potentially stolen?

This is a proposal for when the hypothetical situation is about to become reality. If SHA-256 ever proves to be broken we need a plan to switch from that as well. Just because a situation is hypothetical, it doesn't make it bad to plan for it.

No, we were talking about whether mining enforces protocol rules or not. It doesn't, except through soft forks which weren't originally intended. POW decides on transaction order only. 
The block size limit is another discussion that I don't really care about having. Hashing power is not a way to decide that though, as originally intended.

As ELI5 as it can get:
CT uses a special kind of encryption that preserves addition while hiding the actual values.
So say you have the values A, B and C. You encrypt each value and get the encrypted data X, Y and Z. Since the property of addition is preserved you can still compare the numbers.
If A + B = C
Then X + Y = Z
So by comparing the sum of the encrypted input with the sum of the encrypted output in a transaction, everyone can make sure they are equal without actually knowing anything about the amount of money being involved.

It's not a binary effect. The benefits of LN will almost certainly come gradually. Some would use it almost immediately, whereas others very well may wait 3-4 years. It will implemented and used by those who need it the most first, and as the user experience gets more polished more people will use it.
I would expect that exchanges and big merchants such as Coinbase and Bitpay would implement LN very fast to save on fees for transactions between themselves. If the transactions between all exchanges could be reduced to a few transactions per month, then that would free up space for other transactions as well.

That's a theorized solution that still always seem to be reduced to just a more roundabout POW-scheme once you look at optimal mining strategy more closesly.
Basically, all proposed POS-schemes that went through any form of peer review has been shown to either just be a roundabout POW-scheme or to rely on centralized check points or the like. The POS supporters got around this "problem" by simply making so many different implementations that people just stopped peer reviewing them all.
I'm happy to be proven wrong though, so if there's a POS protocol out there that has gone through a substantial amount of peer review by reputable security experts, then please link it.

The last symbols of a bitcoin address are just used for error checking (called a checksum).

Isn't it irresponsible to commit to something you don't know the risks of?
While a 2 MB increase may be reasonably safe, what's the next step? Bend to political pressure and commit to an increase in the blocksize every time we close in on the limit?
A big reason some don't want to commit to a certain date is that they prioritize decentralization over scalability. This means that the blocksize can increase when it's proven to be safe, not sooner. So anyone who wants the blocksize to increase would be far better of in doing the necessary research instead of trying to get it through via political pressure.

And since we're talking about a softfork, if the UASF chain ever overtakes the oldchain again, then the oldchain will automatically accept the UASF chain as the correct one. This means that betting money on the oldchain has an inherent risk that the UASF chain doesn't have, since the oldchain will eventually "evaporate" if it doesn't win.

No. If they go too far out of users interests they will end up with a worthless crypto. There is always some wiggle room where they can enrich themselves at the cost of users as long as the cost is not too high. For example, look at the amount of empty blocks that antpool mines. That's incentivized by asicboost (partly, there's also the spy mining incentives). It's not killing Bitcoin, but it's certainly not good either.

No, a hard fork can happen without any consensus at all. A hard fork is basically an altcoin that keeps Bitcoins transaction history. 
A soft fork can't happen without 50%+ of the hashing power as the forked chain would be destined to be shorter than the main chain. A hard fork however, can be done with any amount of miners by simply having a rule that makes the main chain invalid. Hard forks with close to no consensus or overwhelming consensus are not dangerous though as it's clear for everyone which chain should be considered the real Bitcoin. They only get dangerous when there is wide disagreement on which chain should be considered the real Bitcoin and which one should be refused.

Fake transactions, as in a transaction from myself to myself, with the transaction fee going to myself as well. A block filled with those transactions is functionally identical to an empty block, but can be hidden from plain view. People will just start noticing that they can't get their transaction into a block regardless of the fee.
Sure, you could notice that it's the same coins going around in circles, but then you would have to make a new rule banning blocks only containing transactions with these specific coins. That would be a lot more controversial than just banning empty blocks, and there's nothing stopping the attacker to just circumvent the new rule as well.

But it does show that someone has the mining resources and is willing to spend a ridiculous amount of money at attacking Bitcoin, and any countermeasure to the attack could be met with a counterattack. So you add a checkpoint. The attacker just does it again requiring continuous upgrades of the client. So now you decide it's a better idea to simply ban empty blocks completely. Then the attacker starts obfuscating their empty blocks by filling them with transactions to themselves.
And so on. If you have majority hashing power you can cause significant disruption, and it might even be possible to do it while completely hindering any outsider from even being able to understand what's happening.

Price is an exchange ratio between two goods. Value is a subjective appraisal of a good or service.
Price does not represent value. In fact, price represents a difference in value. In order for an exchange to happen (and thus a price to arrise), two economic actors need to value 2 goods differently from eachother.
If I buy 1 liter of milk for 1 USD, it does not mean that the milk is valued at 1 USD. It means I valued it more than 1 USD and the seller valued it less than 1 USD. Thus, whenever an exchange occures, it's an example of an inequality in valuations, not equality.

He is specifically talking about the scenario where someone overpowers the network i.e. majority hashpower. And he is saying it doesn't matter if you have the majority of hashpower. If your blocks break the consensus rules of Bitcoin, you might as well not exist as far as the rest of the network is concerned.


It still is a non-event in terms of network operation.


You are implying it.


As far as the Bitcoin network is concerned, chains that break the consensus rules don't even exist. A chain that is ignored is obviously not the dominant one. If Satoshi intended for the Bitcoin network to take the hashpower of rule-breaking chains into account, then surely he would have programmed his client to do so. Instead, any chain that breaks the consensus rules is flat out ignored by his client.


I agree that node count is a very unreliable and gameable stat. Consensus is not really quantifiable and can't be measured. The Bitcon rules just are what they are. Either you miners follow them, or they will be ignored by the network.


Bitcoin's POW-algorithm is clearly designed to reach a consensus on conflicting transactions, something that was impossible without a trusted centralized server before Bitcoin. [In Satoshi's words]( it is a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem. The Byzantine Generals Problem is a very specific problem caused by network latency giving different nodes a different idea on which transaction was first. It is this very specific problem that mining resolves, nothing else.
Using POW for anything else than time-stamping is redundant, it adds attack vectors for no discernible gain, and it is simply not how any of the code Satoshi wrote actually worked. Why do keep standing behind the position that Satoshi intended it for anything else, when it doesn't make sense from a security standpoint and none of his code actually worked like that?

It's entirely possible to add a reversible layer of payments on top of an irreversible layer. It's impossible to go the other way, to add a irreversible layer on top of reversible payments.
Also, if you want reversible payments, the need for decentralization kind of disappears. Just have the party that you trust to make the decisions track all transactions as well, and get rid of all the unnecessary overhead.

I'm not even talking about the Bitcoin price specifically. I'm talking about the economic theory behind prices in general, and the difference between a price and value. Your "summary" doesn't even touch on that.
Your explanation is also wrong. All prices are determined by demand and supply. And even then, you would have to explain the connection between demand and subjective valuations to truly understand how market prices arise.

I believe confidential transactions is the single most important potential upgrade for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-18 12:06:04
Satoshi is talking about what power miners have. If miners decided consensus rules, they would be incredibly powerful. Satoshi mentions that their power is limited to double spending. That very much contradicts that they would be deciding consensus rules in general.
I think there are two very strong arguments why your interpretation of the white paper is wrong.
First of, it doesn't make any sense at all security wise. POW is a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem. Every part of Bitcoin except double spend prevention works without mining. It's entirely possible to verify a chain of transactions with digital signatures without a POW-system. What's not possible is to resolve conflicting transactions. If it wasn't for the possibilty of double spending, Bitcoin wouldn't need mining. Bitcoin as a whole would've been a lot simpler, and likely have been invented 20+ years ago. Bitcoin's POW-algorithm was just the missing piece of the puzzle that solved one very specific but important problem to make a system like Bitcoin work.
Using POW for anything but double spend prevention adds no benefits to Bitcoin, but makes the system as a whole more vulnerable to malicious miners. It's simply bad security practise to give participants powers they don't need, and miners aren't necessary for anything else. Basically, the [principle of least privilege]( tells us that miners should not do anything but help us resolve transaction conflicts, because they are simply not needed for anything else.
Second point, if miners were supposed to be the basis of consensus rules, then why doesn't Satoshi's code work like that? All the code Satoshi ever wrote use mining to resolve double spends. Not a single line of his code relies on mining to form any kind of consensus on any part except transaction ordering. If Satoshi meant for us to let the miners decide on consensus rules as well as transaction ordering, then surely his client would have actually done that, don't you think?

A transaction always involves two parties, and external costs are always relevant to them both.

Just because there's a relationship between the two, it doesn't mean that it's possible to go in both directions. Yes, we may break the algorithm at some point in the future, but it's also feasible that it's not mathematically possible to do so.

Bank secrecy is a thing. While your bank may know about your transactions they are not allowed to share them however they want, and doing so comes with harsh penalties. So while privacy is somewhat going away in the traditional financial system, there are some pretty strict limitations.

If something in the whitepaper is unclear, the logical thing is not to take one sentence from it, and interpret it the way you want. The logical thing to do is to look what satoshi had to say about it when people asked him questions about it.
If you look at the cryptography mailing list where he released the white paper, satoshis comments there make it clear that your interpretation of the white paper is wrong.
Here he explains that miner power is limited to double spends (which is consistent with the view that they are responsible for transaction ordering, and not protocol rules):


scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins. With a zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined.
If your interpretation of the white papet was correct, this comment of satoshi would make no sense whatsoever.
More importantly, there is absolutely no need at all to make miners more powerful than necessary. A good cryptosystem limits attack vectors. POW is a solution to the Byzantine Generals Problem. Using it for anything else doesn't solve a problem, it just adds attack vectors. Giving miners any authority to vote on anything more than transaction ordering is completely unnecessary, and just makes Bitcoin easier to attack. To believe that Satoshi would do something that stupid is laughable.

Incentives aren't binary. You can't look at it like it's either profitable or not profitable. Neither is corruption something that either exists or not, there are different levels of corruption. The strength of the profit incentives are one of many factors that affects the final level of corruption in a state. 
Simply put, the profit incentives of corruption work against the checks and balances of the state. If the incentives causing corruption are smaller, the checks and balances stand a better chance at preventing it.

In a softfork, it's entirely possible to play with a team who dislikes the new ruleset. You and me could play a basketball game against a team that uses both hands while we only use one hand.

This completely disregards many issues, for example Prisoner's dilemma type problems, where miners would all be better of if they all did A, but they are individually better off if they do B while everyone else keep doing A.

But dollars and pesos are political creations. They both exist, not because multiple currencies add value to the economy, but because politicians want the power that comes with controlling your own currency. Economically, multiple currencies add friction every time you need to exchange between them. That is an economic cost. Markets naturally converge towards fewer currencies, because it's the most efficient way to trade. Markets chose gold and silver as money (and may have eventually converged to just one of them). It was politicians who chose the mess of hundreds of national currencies we have today.
A good analogy is languages. Yes, multiple languages exist, but they don't really add much in terms of communication. You can communicate the same ideas in English as in Spanish. The competition between languages doesn't really add anything in communication abilities. Having both languages just makes communication harder where the two languages meet.

If someone wants to sell at 150 when the market actually values BTC to 250 then that's their problem. The price will go back up again as soon as liquidity hits the exchange. The only situation where this could affect the long term price is if people panic or make rash decisions based on the temporary swings. But if you panic based on what is simply one entity's action then you aren't the most suitable to actually have a say in the true expected value of bitcoins, and you should lose money as a result. 
Next time someone "wipes out the order book", just sit back and laugh at their stupidity to sell under market value, or laugh at the fools that believe the swing actually represents a change in the long term value of bitcoins and panic sells. If no one panicked it would make the move incredibly unprofitable.

Well, you can make reasonable assumptions based on the amount of POW after the transaction. If you actually did just pull that transaction out of thin air and the bitcoin network functioned properly, then most miners would have ignored the block. Thus, if the transaction is far enough back in the blockchain, either the transaction has to be valid, or the network has been dysfunctional for a very long time. It's not ideal but I don't see the issue as unsolvable either.

You may be joking but in case you are not, I think you are missing what that site is. It's not an actual database of all key pairs. It just lists all private keys in numerical order and generates all keys and addresses on demand. You can't search by public key because there is no database of public keys to make that search. It's impossible to even get close to generate all public keys and addresses.
To even just list all private keys on one page would be impossible, which is why you have to click next all the time.

The secondary and primary markets affect eachother. If the price goes down on the secondary market, then the opportunity cost of buying on the primary market has gone up. It obviously will not affect past sales. That's so obvious I don't even know why you brought it up. It will however affect all future sales. 
Look at it like this. If the market was suddenly flooded with good quality used cars the immediate effect would be on the price of used cars. But people would also become less inclined to buy new as the opportunity cost of doing so increases. 
In the case of treasuries the difference is even bigger, as their is no quality difference between "used" and" new". Noone in their right mind would pay a big premium just to buy in the primary market when they can buy essentially the exact same product in the secondary market cheaper. If the price goes down in one, it goes down in the other.

The point that you seem to be missing is that there are two people splitting the cost of the spread when you buy or sell bitcoins. So if you sell in india you are paying more like 0,7% for that (the buyer pays the other half).
So if you want to remit from the US the cost is 0,7% + whatever the cost of buying in the US is (only half the spread there as well).

This is correct. But you have to add the cost of aquiring bitcoins as well.
So we either have to specify where we buy to make an exact calculation, or make an estimation based on some assumption. If we assume the spread is about the same in the US the total cost ends up being around 7 USD. If you have reason to believe US exchanges are cheaper it ends up being lower than that. 
In the end, the exchange rates differ geographically as well, and that has a much bigger impact on the final cost.

I believe that the bigger Bitcoin is, random noice becomes more likely to cancel eachother out than to go in the same direction.
If only two people is enough to change the price x%, then if they randomly sell for non trading reasons, the price will go down. If thousands of people is needed for the same effect, it's less likely that they all perform the same action at the same time.
So there should be an inverse correlation between the amount of users and volatility.

There is a big difference between a hobbyist leaving money on the table and a profit-maximizing business doing it. I expect quite a few people have bigger sums of excess cash in their homes as well and are missing out on returns because of this. But I would never expect a company such as Apple keeping their excess cash in something that doesn't give them a decent ROI.
Also, there is currently a speculative reason to just hoard bitcoins "in case it takes over the world" or whatever future scenario you might envision. The LN network would have to work in a world where Bitcoin has already reached its potential, and it actually functions as a trusted medium of exchange with neither any big upside nor downside. So if you imagine a world where many investements and contracts are already denominated in Bitcoin, then the profit of the Lightning Network needs to match those of other investments. Otherwise, the LN nodes are leaving money on the table, simply by not having their coins in an interest bearing account.

You are describing rounding, which is related but not the same.
Significant figures are an indication of how accurate a measurement is. The more significant figures we have, the more accurate it is. There are rules on how to use significant figures, and if you use them wrongly, then you give of a false sense of accuracy that doesn't exist.
So both 0.14 and 0.15 have 2 significant figures. If we measure 0.15 it means that a reader can deduce that the real value is somewhere between 0.145 and 0.155, because all of those numbers would round to 0.15.
If we write 0.150 instead then we have 3 significant figures. The last 0 may look redundant, but it actually tells us something about the accuracy of the measurement. It means that the real value has been measured to be between 0.1495 and 1505.

That incident was very close to permanently split the network in two. It took everyone by surprise, and some developers argued to keep the hardforked chain because it had more hashing power. The only reason it went as well as it did was because of some pretty quick thinking form Luke, who managed to talk some sense into everyone. So ultimately, we managed to get the majority of hashing power to switch back to the chain that would eventually bring everyone to the same chain, and Bitcoin as we know it was saved.

You can argue and look at it any way you want. It's technically irrelevant. A hardfork is technically two different coins, and the technology doesn't care about why some nodes are on one coin, and some are on the other.
Whether you want to call chain A or chain B for the real Bitcoin is just semantics. There can be good arguments for both, like in the Ethereum scenario. This is a strong argument for softforks over hardforks, as they don't cause any ambiguity of which chain is the real one.

I think the argument is way too simplistic to be taken seriously. Fees are a variable, not a constant. His entire argument crumbles with that flawed premise.
In the long run, I think Bitcoin needs both on chain and off chain scaling. However, it is lagging behind on the cryptographically clever off chain proposals, so I believe work there is way more urgent.
But there is one thing I want to make very clear here that a lot of people seem to misunderstand. Raising the block size limit is not scaling! It's increasing capacity without improving scaling.
If you have a capacity limit on a bridge, the way to raise the limit is to improve the bridge, and then prove to what degree that the limit can be safely increased, vet the proof through peer reviewed channels, and then raise the limit. The only person I still take seriously on the "raise the block size limit"-side of the debate is Jeff Garzik, and his opinion is in the vast minority among those with the technical know how to actually be relevant.

Now you're arguing something else. I know interest rates are currently extremely low, and they probably will be for the foreseeable future.
My only argument has been that the selling of treasuries creates a downwards pressure on price, and thus an upwards pressure on interest rates (on both primary and secondary markets). The fact that this pressure is currently dwarfed by other factors has no effect on my argument.
I'm not trying to argue this is the end of the world for the US. But an upwards pressure on US interest rates is a negative for the US, even if it's not catastrophic. At the moment it probably just means that it will be slightly harder for the FED to reverse quantitative easing.

Because they have barely any economic activity aside from trading. That means less risk to cost people money (still, the Ethererum HF did cost some exchanges money).
Because their development team is way smaller, so there is no possibility for as much disagreement between the developers. 
Altcoins are more replacable than Bitcoin. If any user of an altcoin were to disagree with a proposed HF, he would most likely just buy and start promoting another altcoin. Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency that's not an altcoin, and for those who believe that currencies naturally converge towards one, there is really no replacement.
There is way less at stake. Bitcoin has actual enemies to a degree that no other coin does, and it is the most high profile cryptocurrency. If Bitcoin were to fail it would sow doubt about the very concept of cryptocurrencies and set back all cryptos for years. This makes it the obvious target for anyone that wants it to fail.
Edit: To clarify, a hardfork is not bad. A failed hardfork is very bad, and the risk of failure is bigger in Bitcoin than in other cryptos, because of the above reasons.

Not always, but most of the time it does. Engineering is almost always about trade-offs. For example, confidential transactions, which would undoubtedly improve the privacy of Bitcoin, comes with a fairly high cost with the fairly big size of the range proofs, and this would lead to increased costs for nodes, and thus less decentralization. Wether or not this privacy enhancing feature is worth the cost is up for debate. Pretty much all changes to Bitcoin will mean a trade-off in some way.


You aren't going to get it by ignoring the perverse miner incentives you get with bigger blocks either.
But ignorance is bliss I guess. Luckily, most Bitcoin devs aren't as ignorant as you.


I want a Bitcoin that works and serves a purpose more than anything else. I don't believe Bitcoin will never have blocks bigger than 1 MB. However, it seems pretty clear that at some point we will hit a hard limit that we absolutely can't pass unless we want to completely destroy what makes Bitcoin valuable in the first place. So I think all bigger changes to Bitcoin need to be based on quite a bit of research, peer review and debate before they go through. I believe most of the anger in the r/btc comes from the fact that they're not used to the academic approach, and how much time peer reviewed and vetted changes actually take. Personally, I'm very satisfied with the development process as I find it extremely rigid and methodical.
@_date: 2016-10-24 22:25:31
One thing that the big blockers completely disregard is that supply is actually being limited by two factors, the block size limit, and the minimum transaction fee. The irony is that none of them seem to argue that we should remove the minimum transaction fee as well. And the reason is pretty obvious. As transaction costs go to 0, transaction demand goes towards infinite (0 is pretty cheap for infinite storage of arbitrary data, maybe google would like to back up their youtube servers).
The big blockers should be way more concerned with the minimum transaction fee. If the block size limit is the difference between 1 MB blocks and 2 MB blocks, then the transaction fee minimum is currently the difference between MB-blocks and GB-blocks. Of course, Bitcoin would completely break without this limit, but this doesn't seem to be the big blockers main concern. The market (which apparently excludes the developers) will solve this.

Bitcoin won't magically implode once all the block starts to get full. So that's not the deadline. It will put some pressure on client developers to have good fee policies though, and force people to use the space more scarcely. But that won't kill Bitcoin. 
The only real threat here is that the block limit is never raised and another coin overtakes Bitcoin because of it. But we have years before any altcoin is even close to handle the volume that Bitcoin does, if it ever happens.
Thus we have years to get this right, and getting it right is way more important than getting it done quickly.

But it's not. Remember how hard it was for the core team to implement segwit?


Less people than has lost money in various Bitcoin exchange hacks, and Bitcoin is stronger today for not rolling back those times.
Bitcoin has only been rolled back to fix issues in the Bitcoin protocol (overflow bug). Every time someone has lost money while the protocol worked as intended they've had to eat that loss themselves. Ethereum hard forked to reverse a hack of a transaction where the ethereum protocol worked as intended. That is a huge difference, and it basically set the precedent that all their talk about "code as law" is just marketing buzz words. If you can reverse ethereum transactions, then ethereum contracts could just be run on a fairly trusted central server instead. Decentralization without immutability is just unnecessary overhead.

A hardfork is a hardfork. It's irrelevant if we're forking to rules that have previously been valid. A hardfork is basically making an altcoin from a certain block in the chain. Nodes and users will choose (either by a conscious choice or by inaction) which chain they prefer. In your case, the majority of nodes has chosen the pre-segwit chain by inaction.
Miners generally don't choose in the same way. They follow economic incentives and just mine on the chain that profits them the most.

The problem here is that you seem to think there is a huge difference between the secondary and primary market. They are largely one and the same market that are selling the exact same product, with some (quite extensive) regulatory rules on who gets to participate in each. Bonds on the primary and secondary market are almost perfect substitution goods, so their prices are as correlated as they get.
Everything that happens on the secondary market will happen on the primary market as well. It's almost impossible that the price moves on one without the other following.

You are still giving too much authority to miners. Mining is the mechanism in which the Bitcoin system agrees on the order of transactions in order to prevent double spends. That's it.
The entirity of Bitcoin would work perfectly fine without mining if it wasn't for the double spend problem. The double spend problem is the only part of Bitcoin that requires mining in order to work, and thus mining was implemented in order to solve this issue. Using mining for anything else is like using a screw driver as a hammer. It might work to some degree but it's simply not what the tool was made for.

Storage is not the issue and it has never been the issue in the block size debate. You think you are proving a point, but the only thing you're proving is your ignorance of the issue by bringing up something completely irrelevant.
The issue is latency to propagate a block and that too big blocks  gives some miners possibility to game the system for their own gain, which ultimately would harm the decentralization. It doesn't matter what the bandwith and storage costs are for a miner, if you change the incentives so that the equilibrium will push us to end up with one centralized mining company. The problem is that if mining gets too centralized, Bitcoin has lost the very thing that made it valuable in the first place. Mining pools are already extremely centralized, so any proposal that makes this worse has to be vetted to the highest standard before being implemented.

The current code devs have been very good at setting the precedent that in the case of a controversial fork, the old fork is Bitcoin proper. During the segwit debacle they made a point that they couldn't force the change on anyone, and if the community refused it then that was it.
Mining pools also have limited power. They can censor a chain and veto protocol changes, but they can't really force a protocol change on the community either.

First off. I'm not from the US, so this is probably not applicable for most other people here.
I've sold Bitcoins every now and then for the past two years, and I have paid caital gains taxes for those sales, and I plan to pay the taxes for the sales of this year.

Libertarianism is based on the non aggression principle. It's the moral prinicple that you are free to do whatever you want with yourself and your property as long as you are not initiating violence against another person or his property. No one is exempt from this principle, not even the government.
Taxation is the taking of another persons property under the threat of violence. If anyone but the government does it, it's armed robbery. If the tax victim tries to defend himself the state is prepared to escalate the situation to the point where they imprison or kill the victim.
Democracy goes against the philosophy of libertarianism. It's all about non-aggression. It doesn't matter if it's a dictator or a supermajority of people that want to rule over you.

They are the ones with the narrative that capacity is the most pressing issue, and that Bitcoin is doomed without it. And they are the ones blocking it. They are essentially blocking the very thing they claim to think is most important, and think it puts them in some kind of improved position of negotiation. There are plenty of other things for core to work on in the meantime.

Doesn't matter if it would sync the chain or not - RPCs would still work. Might be tricky to identify which addresses to export, however.
So there's no difference in the wallet format? A newer QT-client would still recognize my old wallet?
Aren't the addresses ordered somehow? If so, I think I should just be able to dump the keys in order until I find one that's never been used.


I had a very interesting talk with my bank today after withdrawing quite a lot of money the past few months. I've owned all my coins since 2011 and it would definitely help to be able to prove this (proving this will be fairly trivial, getting my bank to actually understand the proof will be the hard part).
The reason I need the keys from this old wallet is because I moved all my coins to a trezor at one point, so without this wallet I only have half the history.

Inflation in a currency as bitcoin actually make some sense. With fiat, inflation is a redistribution of wealth from savers to borrowers, and to the actors who gets to recieve the borrowed money early in its life. The inflation serves no productive purpose. In crypto, inflation is a redistribution from savers to miners. Since this redistribution actually goes towards securing the currency itself it makes some sense. Savers are paying miners a percentage to secure their savings. 
I'm not arguing we should change it or anything. I'm just saying it wouldn't be nearly as harmful as in fiat.

Miners put a time stamp on transactions. That's it.
Basically, almost every rule in Bitcoin is enforced without mining. The only exception is double spend protection. If it wasn't for the possibility of double spends, then mining would be completely redundant. Everyone could be broadcasting their transactions to the network and validate the signatures of other transactions without miners. But if someone makes two conflicting transactions, then this system falls apart. Mining is simply a decentralized solution way to determine "when" a transaction takes place. If a transaction isn't in a block, then it hasn't officially occured yet. Thus double spends are solved by simply waiting to see which of the two transactions gets confirmed.

No they would have to outperform the interest rate. The value increase plays no part in any investment decision. 
If the value of money increases by X% and the market interest rate is Y%, then Y is the only relevant factor in my investment decisions.
Can my investment increase my cash holdings by more than Y percent? 
If the answer is yes, do the investment. If not, the opportunity cost is too high so you are better of lending whatever money you have to someone else who can beat the market interest rate. At no part do you have to consider any changes in value of money.
More money is always better than less. I'd rather have 2000 USD than 1000, regardless of its value. The investor cares about increasing his cash holdings, and the interest rate is the bar that determines if an investment is good enough to be made. If you can't beat the interest rate, it's an indication that other people can do more good with your money than you can.
Besides, with a static money supply, the value increase of money is a consequence of increased output. The argument that high deflation would prevent investments relies on the assumption that there already are a lot of investments being made.

There's an issue of double standards when it comes to concern with conflict of interest though. Sure, it's only wise to be critical when there is money at stake. So by all means, be sceptical to what the core developers say, and keep this potential conflict of interest in mind. But where was this concern for a conflict of interest when Coinbase and Brian Armstrong were out in force trying to promote the hardfork? Where was the concern when Mike Hearn immediately went to work with the bigger banks after he didn't get his way? What potential conflict of interest does Gavin Andresen have?
I have nothing against scepticism. But if you are only concerned of a conflict of interest when people have an opposite opinion than you, it can't really be classified as healthy scepticism. It's just obvious bias.

In the chat logs from the time of the incident, he argued that we should simply accept the forked chain which split Bitcoin in two, while someone else (I believe it was luke) argued that if we could get a majority of miners to switch back the two chains would eventually converge. Gavin's argument was simply "majority hash power rules, if it splits the blockchain in two then so be it". That made me raise an eyebrow as even I understood miners don't vote on consensus rules, only transaction ordering, and he was a Bitcoin developer.

By all means, be concerned by any potential conflict of interest that you think Blockstream might have. But make sure you are equally critical of companies that speak out in favor of the hardfork.
IMO, once you start looking at the incentives of companies like Coinbase you should be very critical of what they have to say. It's a lot easier to see how they would benefit financially from an increase in the block size than how blockstream would benefit from segwit. And it's not at all clear that Coinbase's incentives align with the decentralization goals of Bitcoin. In fact, it's easier to see how they would benefit from centralization than from decentralization. So when they disregard centralization concerns, your skeptical alarm should sound.
When it comes to Blockstream it's a bit more unclear how they would earn money from something like Segwit or Schnorr signatures. I can't see any way they make money of these, so I can only conclude they actually believe these to be beneficial technologies. And while they still might have some financial reasons to favor what they do, such incentives seem really unclear and far weaker than for those that argue for the blocksize increase.
A lot of people are just selectively sceptical, using "conflict of interest" as an argument only when it fits them. If scepticism is just a tool that you use to argue against things you don't like, then you are using it wrong. You are supposed to use scepticsim against your own beliefs to test their strength.

The interest rate would be determined by supply and demand of capital. If the supply of capital for rent goes down, the interest rate goes up, increasing the incentive to lend. 


In response to this, the very point of a market interest rate is to ration limited capital to the highest yielding investments.
Let's say I can utilize some resources and gain a 5% yearly return, and you can utilize the same resources more efficiently and gain a 20% return. Everyone is actually better off if I lend you my resources at an interest rate between 5 and 20 percent. I earn more, you can expand your business, and more resources are used towards your higher yielding purpose. If we somehow artificially lower the interest rate to less than 5 percent, this option disappears. I will be competing against you for limited resources when everyone (me included) would be better off if I didn't.
So I think the biggest problem today isn't really inflation, but rather that we have removed the very function of an interest rate, which is to ration capital towards the highest yielding investments, not just any positive yielding investment.
Artificially lowering the interest rate isn't very different than lowering other prices. Say we had measures that lowered the price of Lithium. That would mean that more people saw profitable uses for it and would compete for it in the marketplace, leaving less Lithium for other companies like Panasonic who sees profitable uses for it at today's prices. The price of Lithium rations it to its **most** profitable use cases, not just any profitable use case. The price of capital should ideally do the same, but we have unfortunately removed this function to a large degree. Maybe it is the case that Google should have more programmers and Apple should have less. We can't really tell because they are both making their investments and hiring decisions with flawed price information. 
And I don't see how this would reduce social mobility. It actually betters the situation of people with low yielding investment options by giving them an even better option than they currently have.

We are currently mining 1 billion USD worth of BTC/year. To have the same level of security with mining (arguably we would need more security the more popular Bitcoin is) at the end of the Bitcoin mining reward, 1 BTC would have to be worth 2 trillion USD in todays USD purchasing power. The total Bitcoin supply would be worth 4.2*10^19 USD, which is 4 orders of magnitudes higher than all the money in the world today.
So I actually do know how much a BTC is worth in 100 years. The answer is "not enough to secure the network with only the mining reward".

The bottleneck to run a node is currently utxo storage (which is generally held in ram). Segwit is better in this regard because it incentivizes transactions with less outputs.

The difference between segwit as a SF vs HF is literally where the witness data is stored. In a SF it is stored in the coinbase transaction. In a HF you create a new place to store it. All the critical code is basically identical in both scenarios, but with a SF you keep backwards compatibility and avoid the risk of an ethereum-like "classic" fork.

You respond: "You haven't proven anything, dumbass."
If you're going to call someone dumb, you should at least learn to read properly first.
The only thing we know is that Microsoft accepts bitcoins. Anything beyond that is pure speculation and guesswork. I admit so much. You guess and put forward your guesses as fact. And you respond with poorly thought out insults when your guesswork is being called out for what it is.

Say I make a p2sh transaction to you today that you need to make a 1 kB+ transaction to spend (because of the nature of the script). Tommorow we hardfork Bitcoin to disallow transactions bigger than 1 kB. Your coins have become unspendable even though they're in a block before the hardfork. 
@_date: 2017-05-12 12:44:08
It solves a big bug, transaction malleability.
It allows smarter contracts and smarter payment channels.
It increases the amount of transactions in a block at a lesser cost than a block size increase would have.
It opens up the door for schnorr signatures, which will both allow more transactions per block and incentivize coinjoin transactions (increased privacy)
It would definitely be beneficial.

And likewise, it would be impossible for an attacker to build that kind of infrastructure immediately as well.
With the current pow algorithm, the infrastructure to 51% attack Bitcoin is already in place. You just need to bribe/threaten like 3 people.
@_date: 2016-10-11 12:42:34
Satoshi was very clear that miner consensus has to do with the ordering of transactions, nothing else. He said that even a miner with more than 51% of the hashing power can't change the protocol against the will of the users. 51% only gives you the power to double spend.
This was before soft forks though, which can be considered a workaround that makes it possible to change the protocol with only hashing power. Soft forks have only been used to improve Bitcoin so far, but they do add an attack vector as they make Bitcoin easier to change in general.

Difficulty is not the only thing that matters though. A pow change would be a strong disincentive for malicious mining activity, which might be more important than the slight difficulty change.
More importantly, you completely ignored the part of my post that shows this cost is really small compared to other overhead costs. I'll repeat myself. Miners already know that their rigs will be obsolete within a few years. They are working profitably under these conditions right now. There's a 100% risk that a rig will become obsolete because of improved tech. A small percentage risk of them becoming obsolete because of pow change is a much smaller cost than that. 
Besides, miners are in control of the risk of pow change. If they want to minimize that risk they should simply stay away from acting like rulers over the system and do their job, which is to vote on transaction ordering, nothing else. If they do this, the risk is 0, and a rational miner would just keep on mining Bitcoin.

And yet, the profits of the most profitable trader isn't anywhere near the most successful hodler.

First mover advantage and network effects are different things. Bitcoin has a network effect while Ethereum only has a first mover advantage.
Network effects are much more powerful. It means that the value of something increases with the amount of users. First mover advantage only means you have a head start. Network effects get stronger with time, whereas first mover advantage gets weaker.
Languages are an example of something that benefits from network effects. The more people who speak a language, the more valuable it becomes. The general tendency in the world is that smaller languages are disappearing and everyone is moving slowly to bigger languages.
First mover advantage is not at all as powerful. My computer doesn't get better just because you are using the same brand as me. If one manufacturer comes out with a new feature they have a first mover advantage. But other manufacturers can copy this feature, and over time the first mover advantage disappears. This is in stark contrast to network effects which get stronger over time.
Currencies are another example of something that benefits from network effects. The more people who accept a currency, the more useful it becomes for everyone. To outcompete an established currency you need to offer a huge advantage. Small improvements isn't enough, as the cost of using an illiquid currency is bigger than the cost of using the one that's slightly worse.
Smart contracts do not have network effects. It doesn't really matter to me what smart contract platform you use, not anymore than I care what legal firm you're using to write your regular contracts. Your legal firm might have a first mover advantage, but in the end, it's only the quality of my contract that matters, not how many others are using a similar contract. My contract does not get more valuable because you are using the same one in another deal. So I'll just use the cheapest and most convenient at the time.
This is why even though Apple had a really big head start in smart phones, other manufacturers managed to catch up eventually. In the end it only took something like 5-10 years. At the same time, english remains the dominant language in america, has been for hundreds of years, and it will most likely still be so in 100 years from now.

While that's true, my point is that bitfinex doesn't even have *a* BTC price. They are currently selling two things at the same time in a package. Their price is determined by traders who try to price in the future of BTC and the future of bitfinex at the same time.

Too great for what? If mining overhead costs go up, the difficulty simply goes down so that mining remains profitable.
Miners are currently profitable with pretty much a 100% likelihood that their equipment will be obsolete within a few years (because of other factors). A small percentage bump in the risk that it will become obsolete prematurely won't change anything drastically.

You shouldn't be downvoted. You are completely correct.
Clarification for the downvoters. It is possible with a blockchain with predefined rules that allows new coins to be minted by defined keys. That would allow bitcoinlike decentralized transactions while the central bank would keep its monetary policy.

Every single adress in your Trezor has its own private key. But the keys are generated from a master seed in a deterministic way.
It's kind of like the natural numbers. You can pick a random big number like 184765. This is your seed and all you ever need to remember. But you can always generate new natural numbers by adding 1 to the old number. 
184765, 184766, 184767...
There is an unlimited amount of numbers after 184765, but you still only need to remember the first one to be able to generate your whole chain of numbers.
Of course, Trezor uses a whole lot more clever math than just adding 1 to the old key to make it secure. Most importantly it's a one way operation, so you can generate new keys from your seed, but you can't go back to your seed from your private keys.
I'm not an expert, so take everything a say with that in mind. I could be wrong on technicalities, but you should get the general principles from that.

Not really an issue. He overlooks that the pricing mechanism for consumer goods and capital goods are fundamentally different.
Consumer goods are valued solely based on their utility. The price in the long run is determined by the utility and the cost of production. Simple supply and demand, with demand being derived directly from utility.
Capital goods have no direct utility. Their only utility is in the future consumer good they create/will become. Thus, capital goods are priced based on the expected price of the final consumer good. If it takes a year to build a computer, and I expect the price of computers to go down by 10% by then, that sets the maximum I am willing to pay for all the necessary capital goods in the present. If the price is higher than that, I was outbid by someone else who made the same calculation.
Capital goods can't be so expensive that all investments become unprofitable, because it's the very profitability of investments that determine their price to begin with.

The biggest problem of bitcoin remittance is probably exchange rate differences. If the flow of bitcoins from one country to another is heavily one-sided, sell pressures will increase in the receiving country, and decrease in the sending country.
At this point the cost of bitcoin remittance should tend towards the cost of the arbitrage trade that occurs.

The difference is that Bitcoin rolled back to fix a bug in the Bitcoin protocol. Ethereum rolled back because of a bug in an application, while the Ethereum protocol worked as intended.

No one is saying that. However, bitcoin clients fee policy is determined in BTC, so that's what is relevant in this case. The linked statistics doesn't make any difference between one 0.1 BTC fee and 1000 0.00001 BTC fees. So if BTC goes up that stat will go up as well as long as the number of fee paying transactions stays the same, until clients adjust their fee policy to the new value of BTC.

That's not correct. Only a few mining pool operators needed to "upgrade" (downgrade actually).

If Bitcoin would be used nationwide in any country then it couldn't just tank by 50% for seemingly no reasons.

If it were to be used on a daily basis as the main currency in a country then most of the demand would come from actual trade, not from speculation. That would make the demand for bitcoins far more stable, and therefore the price as well

That's not at all what I said. You either just lack reading comprehension or you're intentionally strawmaning me.
Bitcoin gets its value from ALL of its properties, not just one. Difficulty to double spend is just one valuable property of many. If Bitcoin was impossible to double spend but lacked scarcity it would be just as worthless as if the opposite were true. If miners could change the protocol Willy nilly it would also be worthless.
Not needing to trust miners too much is just one more important feature of the Bitcoin protocol.
Here you have it in Satoshi's own words in one of the first emails to the cryptography mailing list:


So there, even Satoshi himself says that an actor with 50% of the mining power is limited to double spending only.

Inflation can mean either or depending on who uses the word. But if you're referring to the purchasing power, then there's nothing inherent about it.

Bitcoin gets its value from being Sound Money. Sound money is useful as money as it is divisible, fungible, portable, durable, generally accepted and scarce. Cryptocurrencies  get their value from all of these features, not just the feature that fits your current argument. Mining is nothing more than protection against one very specific attack, nothing else.


Or I can just ignore them and continue using Bitcoin as I always have done. As far as the Bitcoin network is concerned there's no difference between miners mining invalid blocks, or simply not mining at all. Except for the noise they might make on various forums, rouge miners might as well not even exist. The majority of Bitcoin users are not on Reddit, and most of them would probably not even notice that a bunch of miners decided to go do something else.

Mining solves the double spend problem in a decentralized manner. That's it. Mining is simply a decentralized time stamp method. If you read early Satoshi writings he's pretty clear that miners don't decide everything. They only vote on the order of transactions.

You're still wrong.
Seperating data does not mean that the data disappears. Transactions are about as big as before. The total amount of data that needs to be sent across the network is just about as much.
The difference is that only some data (the unprunable non-witness data) counts towards the block size limit. That does not equal a reduction in transaction size. It is however a reduction in the amount of data that needs to be stored indefinitely.

Your entire post talks about the benefits of software forks, and then you use that as an argument why consensus forks are good. It's entirely possible to fork the software without the risks of consensus forks, so your argument is actually pretty moot.

If some engineers are designing a skyscraper, and there is a bunch of laymen on the sideline who loudly proclaim that they want 1000 floors on the skyscraper, then they will be largely ignored by the engineers as well. That doesn't mean that the engineers are ignoring capacity issues of the skyscrapers. It's the laymen who are ignoring all other issues and safety concerns. The fact that there are capacity limits to building skyscrapers is simply the reality of the matter.
Likewise, it's not the Bitcoin developers that ignored those who wanted to increase the capacity by raising the blocksize limit. It's those who just wanted to increase capacity at all costs who have been ignoring the centralization issues of doing so.

Not true. Do you think cryptographic systems didn't exist before 2009 and the invention the blockchain?
Cryptography generally works according to the principle of trusting everyone as little as possible, and most parts of the Bitcoin protocol works without trusting any miners. Every single piece of Bitcoin is verifiable by each and every node. If you send me bitcoins I can verify for myself that you owned those bitcoins, that you followed all agreed upon rules and that your digital signature is valid. I don't need a miner to do any of that for me. Miners are only needed for resolving double spends (solving the Byzantine Generals Problem), so that is the only power they were given. Giving them more power than that would be going against a core principle of IT security, the [Principle of Least Privilege](
A miner with 50%+ is still limited in what he can do. He can't change Bitcoin, he can't steal coins and he can't create new coins. He can only rewrite history and double spend coins, and perform attacks that follows from this (such as censoring certain transactions).
If it was any other way, Satoshi would have never even talked about double spending. If anyone who overpowers the network could change the protocol of Bitcoin however he wanted, then double spending would be the least of our problems.

PoW systems are different from most things in that the actual work matters. POW has to be "wasteful" in order to serve it's purpose. If you're manufacturing a product it's only the end product that matters. If you find a way to get the same quality product in a more energy efficient way then that's an improvement. With POW the entire point is to expend energy.
Going from CPUs to GPUs is a more efficient way of doing the intended work. ASICBOOST is a way to skip doing some of the work. If you take it to its logical extreme, assume someone finds a way to create a block without doing any work. If Asicboost is just an improvement then skipping all the work would be the ultimate improvement. In reality that would break Bitcoin completely.
ASICBOOST could be seen as an attack on the "proof" part of the pow algorithm. It's a fake proof since it was created without actually performing the work.

Here you go


Transactions are about the same size as before. They can't be smaller without removing something from them. Only part of their size is counted towards the block size limit however.
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:27:09


No it wasn't. Anyone not familiar with the issue would think that you meant what you said, that segwit actually made transactions smaller in an absolute sense, which is simply not true. All the talk about relative size came afterwards

You have to look at it from the other perspective. It's a proven concept that bigger blocks means more centralization, so what you are saying is equivalent to
"at some point Bitcoin will need to get more centralized. Maybe not now, maybe not this year but eventually Bitcoin will become unusable if we keep the same amount of decentralization."

Well, simply increasing the block size limit would also reduce the transaction size relative to the blocks, so I don't think you've thought this argument through. In fact, anything that increases capacity would "reduce the transaction size relative to the limit".
If you have 2 gallons of milk, then segwit seperates it into two one-gallon containers and stores the containers in seperate places. This is not a reduction in the total volume, and claiming so is simply misleading. Saying that you were talking about the volume relative to something else rather than absolute volume is just a cop-out.

Compact blocks doesn't work in the adversarial case. It assumes cooperation between actors who are incentivized to not cooperate. It's a good optimization, but by no means a solution to the centralization issue of bigger blocks.

It's not security by obscurity instead of regular security. It's in addition to it.

Sure, it's an open platform. But the fact that one side of the "debate" seem to be paying for their support while the other doesn't should tell you something about their real support.
The Bitcoin protocol shouldn't be for sale to the highest bidder.
