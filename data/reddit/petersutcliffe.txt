How could you possibly a) know my financial situation b) know the average demographic for these armchair libertarians and c) know their financial situation?

No big deal, just feeding a ton of homeless people and generally being an all round awesome guy to honour the memory of his dead friend.

Oh god, imagine if he had like 50 BTC  and sold them at current market price and this time next month the price has tripled.

Good point. Fucking Skype, used to be crystal clear and now call quality sounds like people are gargling when they talk or whatever half the time.

I was more referring the childish manner in how he speaks to people. He also read my previous posts and commented on one of them pointing out my nationality for no particular reason.

Microsoft should just buy them out already, it's infinitely better than WMP.
Sent them some bit-change. They get about 9USD.  I get a nice round number in my wallet, everyone wins.

I use bitcoin frequently.

Yeah going down a motorway that wasn't necessarily excellently tarmacked on a motorbike wearing flipflops, board shorts and no shirt or helmet... Certainly an interesting experience to say the least.

Yes but if I pay £90 today for 1BTC, then in two weeks I go to buy [item] with my bitcoin and it turns out it's now only worth £50 so I can't buy the item, I'm not going to be too pleased. 
@_date: 2013-09-27 20:45:51
I do remember first finding bitcoin a couple of years ago when it was 1BTC to 14USD, I feel a bit sick that I didn't buy as many as I could and just wait a few years and make a 1000% profit.

Mutual acquaintance of a friend,  paper wallets.  1BTC x5.
Yeah it'd be cool if the price hiked significantly like the rumour mill is predicting.

Bitcoin or fiat in general?
Compare USD to GBP here
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:43:51
Wow thank you for the informative post, I had **no** idea that there are multiple black markets on the darknet. /S
The reason people are upset/angry that SR was taken down is because it was the best site, it had the most vendors, it had the best quality and was very wall ran. BMR and other equivalents are shoddy in comparison.

Thanks, I'll check it out after work.  Not too sure about investing in trading companies though,  global recession anyone? 
*invests £425 of BTC* "Aaaand its gone."
I'll look into ASIC, I'd rather get smaller, guaranteed dividends and maybe move onto speculative trading later (or whatever it is)
I've never invested **anything** before, I turned 18 last October, I've been interested in it for a while though 
@_date: 2013-09-25 22:40:26
That's what it says on the page. I don't think they went through blockchain.info but maybe someone can generate one for general use? I'll print some off at work if they do and stick 'em round town.

Is it easy to set the account up?
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:43:05
Yeah very true on the tax thing I think there are ways of making it technically legal. 
In the UK there is tax avoidance (not paying,  sure fire way to get into prison) and tax evasion;  the thing rich people hire semi crooked accounts to do for them, like offshore accounts etc
@_date: 2013-08-21 18:58:49
Whilst you are getting free electricity and effectively free bitcoins... Will you breakeven due to the increasing difficulties and the costs it took to start it up? Or is this just one of this "I've got money to burn and want to generate my own bitcoins for shits and giggles" type things?
Because if it is that, feel free to donate some bitcoins to me ;)
@_date: 2013-05-29 10:33:04
Also, I'm in a stable financial position, I don't need the cash right now.

I mostly use bitcoin for, ahem *consumables* so if today I got x amount of y for £90 or 1BTC and then consume it. 
Then in two weeks it turns out for I could have gotten the same amount of Y for £50, I would be slightly annoyed, as previously stated.

Yeah, funded by the working and middle classes whilst the rich get around paying tax. Look at the politicians who 'hire' their wives as secretaries whereas in reality, they're doing it to get a tax break, claiming they have a small business.
And the NHS is going to shit too, you pay for what you get.

I'm fairly certain that in two years the US dollar won't have devalued that much. I'd say at most it'll go down to £0.54 to $1. 
I understand that you don't think fiat currencies are valid as a means of intrinsic value anymore, but the bitcoin hate-boner for "regular money" is ridiculous.

It seems the markets are already stabilising, temporarily atleast. I'm about to go to bed, if when I wake up they've fallen through the floor, then I'll buy a few BTC.

You're a fucking sociopath, I greatly admire DPR and think to pull off what he did, you must for one be highly intelligent and two have massive balls.
But the moment you put a hit on someone, you're no longer just a nerd who just happens to be a huge drug kingpin, you become a party to murder in cold blood.
