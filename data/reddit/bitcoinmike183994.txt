@_date: 2017-11-14 07:44:56
and over 100k we go
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:31:39
if the us dollar keeps doing as bad as BTC does good.  Fiat is in trouble.  What if we add another million users in US?  What if we add 2 million?  I am calling it now more and more banks will start shutting down accounts who buy BTC. And pop goes fractional reserve lending.  The great depression kinda stuff where banks shut down and no one gets access to there money.  I look at BTC as an alternative savings account.  It has risks yes, but the last 7 years returns are looking bright.  What if more people looked at BTC as a different savings account?  I mean there are cards out there so your money can be used anyways.  The way banks treat our system, china stopped accepting US dollar.  It is a time bomb, but im a stoner what do i know?  
Edit: i do understand banks are insured, but have you ever dealt with insurance companies?  They are good at 2 things 
1. Collecting money
2. Denying Liability

Buy nano ledger s. You will have to wait to sell the coins but its the safest
@_date: 2017-11-10 22:52:26

@_date: 2018-02-03 18:31:12
he said the price after that point became irrevelant due to no one using fiat money.  Bitcoin basically became immeasurable.  So yeah we blew past mars and went into the next galaxy 
@_date: 2017-10-15 08:06:08
Amazing lol
@_date: 2017-10-27 04:03:49
I bought mine at 6k and personally dont care.  in 10 years whats it going to turn into?  I maybe biased cause i decided to wait and it shot up 1000 dollars.  
but watch the market today and tomorrow.  if you see 5700 buy.  if it goes up to 7 k wait for the next dip
@_date: 2018-02-09 05:28:46

I say move your coins to ledger nano s.  offline cold storage baby
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:55:50
I hear you but these (kids) are people with a lot of money and power in the community.  Letting them off the hook and laughing at counterfeiting isn't going to stop these kids from passing fake dollars to the next guy.   I respect your view but when a dog pisses on your floor you put his nose in it to tell him NO NO bad roger ver
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:09:20
this is crazy but if you hold your private keys arent you getting coins on both sides?
