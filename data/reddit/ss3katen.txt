You could always do a reddit post with a qr code and a pic. 
Ill definitely retweet it if you do.

I guess it depends on who buys them and what they intend to do with them. I think its only 10 different buyers with 9 packs of 3000 bitcoin and one with a bit less

 Ashton Kutcher was an early investor in Skype, Spotify, and Airbnb. Of course he sees Bitcoin as an amazing opportunity.

It would take 38TH to get 1 Bitcoin a day at the current difficulty. And like say592 said, you would be below1/BTC within a few difficulty adjustments. And to get a hold of 38 TH is quite the investment.

I guess there is a dogecoin camp as well now. I'm camping with Madbitcoins this year and I'm pretty stoked to be doing so. This is gonna be an awesome crypto filled burning man

Spend the time to figure out why Bitcoin is important and maybe you'll understand why its on its way to the moon.

I also wouldn't use multibit. Multibit has a problem sometime syncing to the blockchain. I've seen this on at least 3 seperate computers. I've always really like Electrum and Armory.
@_date: 2014-07-18 22:02:27
Hope this helps

To buy the amount of S3 Bitmain antminers that you would need to get a return of 1 BTC a day you would need 87 of the miners. Which is 55.68 bitcoin or 32,760 USD

Welcome good sir

I really doubt that any Doxing will actually occur. 
Satoshi (if it is a singular person) was probably a cypher punk and I severely doubt that his GMX Email account has any information about Him or them personally. And if he was a cypher punk he would be on top of his online anonymity, I don't buy any of this "he configured tor wrong" shenanigan. 
They probably reset his password by guessing his birthday used on the account. The original hacker probably sold the information on the darknet, This is shown by reports from Vice which suggest that it is multiple users who have access to the account. From inside the GMX email someone just requested a password reset to Satoshis p2pfoundation account. Check this picture of Satoshis inbox that shows the p2pfoundation password reset 
I think the hackers big words about doxing Satoshi are a huge bluff, but I guess we'll see in the days to come.

Bitpay is definitely the most reputable payment processor around. 
They are the guys are are shooting Richard Branson and the Winklevii to space in Bitcoin as well as being the payment processor for the Tesla cars sold.
Their merchant accounts are a breeze to use and make it extremely easy to turn your Bitcoin into USD if that's your jam.

I've been bitching about central banking for almost 10 years, Bitcoin is the first peaceful solution I've found.

Cryptsy.com and 
Bittrex.com are pretty rad

Yeah searchfortruthnow2 knows whats up.
Craigslist might have better deals than what you're trying to build
@_date: 2014-06-30 09:56:43
Definitely a paper wallet. bkagn's link should work great.

Haha! what!? 
"Two years. Bitcoins first grabbed worldwide attention when Snowden announced he would take donations in Bitcoins, after the US had imposed a financial blockade on Wikileaks. The Bitcoin protocol was started by a mysterious person who goes by the name of Satoshi Nakamoto. It's believed to be a pseudonym, with the first name derived from brands Samsung and Toshiba. The Bitcoin algorithm produces 12 Bitcoins every few hours and it is designed so that the total number of Bitcoins will never exceed 21 million, which it should reach by 2020. People used to mine Bitcoins, now it's easier to steal them."
Um, no. 
This guys is totally wrong about a slew of things.

The Mycelium app.
@_date: 2014-09-11 08:48:06
Just realized your user name is as above so below. Extra points there :D
 Use the mycelium local trader app. Its like local bitcoins, except it doesn't ask for your information and has a seamless interface.
@_date: 2014-07-30 20:11:00
Classic for sure

It's my understanding that at this point these are the proposed rules and regulations for the state of NY. But once it is in effect, Bitcoin companies will have 45 days to apply for a BitLicense following the release of the final regulations

Nice! I totally picked one of these up at the SF Bitcoin meetup.
@_date: 2014-08-13 18:45:43
Last year the bitcoin meetup was hard as fuck to find, But I recall that it was near camp contact. I think It should be around where "camp bitcoin" is gonna be this year. 
Heres the bitcoin meetup mentioned in the booklet last year
I guess at the Bitcoin meetup on the playa in 2012 the guy who put it on gave everyone who showed up a bitcoin on a paper wallet. Not last year though:P
But he was rad and I think about 40 or 50 people showed up. There is gonna definitely be more people this year.
@_date: 2014-07-04 05:10:33
Definitely the mycelium app if you're on android. It has a built in local trader that is amazing

Mining secures the network and confirms transactions. Without Mining there would be no new blocks, no transactions and no new bitcoins. 
So for the guys just getting in maybe Mining doesn't get as much bang for the buck as buying Bitcoins outright, but with a decent investment Mining can absolutely be worth it.
 Also being a node in the Bitcoin network is rad by itself
@_date: 2014-07-05 08:28:51
Could also happen if you incorrectly log in too many times in a short period.
@_date: 2014-08-13 10:25:09
Nice!! Ill see you out there in two weeks. Love to talk to some more crypto nerds on the playa. Make sure you make it to the Bitcoin meetup on the playa. Its usually on like the last day after everyone is pretty wiped, but it was awesome last year.

Mycelium app

When I saw this quote today I went and posted this on my twitter and someone asked, "what is a blockchain?" Andreas immediately responded with an awesome explanation
 
I love how active Andreas is on social media, even though I miss him in SF :(
