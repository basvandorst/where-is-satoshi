Please fund DRACO research.
*Some history:* before the antibiotic was discovered, bacterial infections were usually a death sentence. People with syphilis would die horrible painful deaths, and things like the Bubonic Plague spread like wildfire unstoppably killing masses of people.
Then the antibiotic was discovered, and now most bacterial infections are easily treatable with a regimen of pills or a shot.
BUT viral infections STILL have no cure.
Whether it be the common cold, or herpes or HIV, we can only treat the symptoms, and not actually cure the body.
BUT DRACO changes all of this.
It is the ANTIBIOTIC to viruses.
In short, it can induce cell-apoptosis on all cells with double-stranded RNA (which is produced ONLY by viruses, and is NOT normally produced by cells not infected with a virus).
This has the potential to cure ANY virus-caused disease, whether it be the common cold, or even HIV.
**tl;dr: bacterial infections were ended by the antibiotic. DRACO can bring an end to virus infections.**
In my opinion, this is possibly the MOST GROUND-BREAKING recent discovery in the medical field.
However, they are getting [barely any funding](


I've been looking for relevant links and found the following:

Did I make it?
I wonder if this will be worth a fortune someday, like the early days when people were being tipped tons of btc.
