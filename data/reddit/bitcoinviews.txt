Hi Jcdobber.  No spam site here - just a fairly new site that wants to put out as much good news to the Bitcoin community as possible, hence the wish to attract more writers and pay them accordingly.

Sorry for the caps - but we did get this release direct from the firm and wanted to share with the BTC community - Apologies if this is not what you expected within the BTC reddit community or from a reddit gold client as is Bitcon:Views.  Please advise me of what I should or shouldnt do here Xrandr, as you seem to always have issues with new news we get direct from businesses, which are trying to get established in the BTC market, therfore, making the market far more robust and solid for the future - Feel free to email me directly at derek and we can establish a good work ethic relating to this group and the posts that come from bitcoinviews.com - I would be more than happy to send any further releases via yourself if this helps - Best regards  - Derek - Editor Bitcoinviews.com

I love that they quote 'up 42 percent from Sunday's close and up 107 percent from a week earlier." - I don't recall BTC having a 'close'!!!

Excellent article Donncha, we have featured an excerpt of your post here ....
I hope we can get our visitors to stop-by your site and read the full article....

Its quite simple to prove Doggy - stick up a wallet address here in the comments and i'll match it with the blockchain transaction id ….  Merry Christmas!

Im not quite sure that fiat deposits in the bank offer better returns....  How is that possible with a 0% interest rate strategy - never mind the risk of bail-ins at any moment and total evaporation of capital.  re Co-op bank in the UK this week.
Sure, I agree markets offer 'returns' they also offer the chance to be wiped out completely.
My point is simply wealth preservation.  Gold and silver are true monetary assets irrespective of a fiat price attached to it and the same goes for bitcoin.
Granted BTC is new and still in beta lets say, and there's no way id go all-in on it, but id certainly treat it like any porfolio manager would treat a gold investment ie 5 - 10% of total portfolio.

Appears to all be back up and functional .....
@_date: 2013-06-30 16:19:23
another marketing gimmick ?!
@_date: 2013-06-20 12:11:53
Correct - 'Physical' Gold is money.  If you have looked at the crazy paper markets in the last 24 hours and had held GLD etc - I think the realization that not holding it in the hand means, basically, you're %$^&amp;*(.  Fizz Gold, Silver or virtual BTC - thats about it.....
@_date: 2013-06-24 10:06:30
Excellent news with respect to commercial adoption in the UK, lets hope its the first of many businesses that implement BTC as a payment solution for their business...
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:11:42
Thanks TT....

What about Silver though?  You can get 1 oz for $20 odd now or even silver dimes.... There's always an opportunity to save...
@_date: 2013-06-24 09:11:32
Thanks for sharing :-)  Good looking system....
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:39:40
I know - and even if the next currency is backed by 'gold' I doubt that the piece of paper/promisory note will allow the little guy to actually get any gold from their bank...
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:38:42
Ye - one word - Zimbabwe.
@_date: 2013-06-22 18:38:19
you are right - but, during Sandy there were quite a few gas stations accepting silver coins for gas.  So all it takes is a scenario where technology breaks apart.  Granted BTC would struggle there as well, but at least if my BTC were stored in a paper wallet or even within the blockchain, id be pretty confident that they'd be there at a later date.  With the banks, im not so sure...
@_date: 2013-06-23 14:12:40
Good points lalicat - I agree if Gox go for it this will provide a decent amount of legitimacy to LTC which can only benefit the crypto world, plus provide a more competitive cost of entry for those that are not currently acquiring crypto.  We shall see!
@_date: 2013-06-24 20:15:50
Another quality article from Vitalik.  Says it how it is!
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:41:09
good post Ross... absolutely the paper markets can be run up and down up and down - esp when certain players have 0 margin requirements.
But the achilles heel will be when physical (especially Silver) runs dry - and I don't think thats too far off right now...

Exactly - premiums will just keep going north as long as this paper BS keeps occurring - good post!
@_date: 2013-06-26 17:52:15
Agreed hatmill.... 0 info just another negative slant...
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:59:09
Yes, the article is old, but the slickness offered by CB is still probably the best on the marketplace - unless you know of any others ...?
@_date: 2013-12-26 01:49:03
Excellent ...
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:55:38
Looks to me - massive short covering on the PM's - the big boys appear to be now be totally net long - everything else.... pumped and now due to be well and truly dumped....

Great post!  I didn't know about the Pirate Ponzi Scheme - A good comment on that page - i'm going to trust my cash with a user called Pirate!  says it all really.... 
@_date: 2013-09-26 00:42:12
Looks like a good concept......
@_date: 2013-06-23 22:44:31
It certainly would - the market is crying out for an innovation such as Coinsetter....
@_date: 2013-06-23 21:01:48
Ye definitely..

Ye good points Juror.....  big diff is that in the 70's it was only a few countries playing PM games - now it IS the whole planet...and with a 0 stockpile of Silver to mess around with, interesting times...

Thats great - never thought of that re the payment processors.....  Thanks for the post.  D.
@_date: 2013-06-20 14:03:46
Does it matter?  its one and the same isnt it...?  a fiat currency based, centrally planned nightmare...

Agreed - with an Arb opp you always have to ask, how is the arb possible?  It shouldnt be there!  and I guess as we are in such early stages of hooking the exchanges together through some kind of automated trading strat, its very hard to achieve the arb - then of course there's always the dreaded fees per side..  Thats when a n arb becomes a loss! LTC could offer a good opp for what was similar to a 'calendar spread' in futures....  lets see....
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:59:13

Not sure I understand why you would think this is not good news?
@_date: 2013-06-22 20:11:50
lol ye - shame about the price etc - well maybe some good will come out of it and soon there should be a decent UK solution.  Not used thebitcoincard.co.uk but it could be another option...

nice article, I noticed the LTC has rallied recently, probably on speculation about being added to MTGOX.  Lets hope that continues as I liked LTC and am certainly a 'holder' :-) 
@_date: 2013-06-22 16:38:01
Very very true!
