Maybe things are better in the states, but where I live (EU) the ATMs are horeshit. Out of the dozen or so different machines I’ve tried to use, Probably at least 50% of the time I get there only to find it’s out of order, or worse still, once a machine threw an error message only after I’ve finished inserting my cash but before the transaction went through, leaving me completely in limbo for over two days while I waited for the machine operator to get back to me via email...
Unfortunately this is one of the problems with an unregulated and completely open eco system, there’s no way to filter out the shit players. Bitcoin is never going to catch on with the general public as long as this level of Micky mouse operation is around. If people are going to trust something with their money, it’s reliability needs to be impeccable.

Actually this isn’t a fact at all, it’s a classic internet urban legend based on sensational misinterpretation of the otherwise banal reality.
The U.K. didn’t ‘deduct’ any polish gold, in fact the opposite is true, the vast majority of Poland’s war debt to Great Britain was voided in 1946.
Furthermore, the Polish situation described above was in no way unusual or exploitative, all Dominion/ Commonwealth armies paid to for the supply of their arms and equipment, and there was never an expectation to the contrary. Britain was certainly in no position to be offering charity, they were practically bankrupted by the war as it was.

My anecdotal experience is that Uber rich can sometimes be frugal in weird ways. Have a family member who lives in a £5 million house, wears designer clothing and only flys first/business class, but whenever we go to the cinema she painstakingly makes sure to book using her membership card in order to save £2 a seat.

An extremely apt quote I remember hearing in regards to this subject is that Technical analysis is to professional trading what astrology is to astronomy.
It has a pretty dubious reputation amongst major financial institutions, somewhere between downright economic quackery and a fringe theory.
That said, given what little there is in the way of traditional quantifiable fundamentals that are applicable to bitcoin, and how heavily it’s affected by herd mentality, there could just be some merit to it when it comes to bitcoin. Maybe..

No they didn’t.
A cargo ship their asset management arm happened to own (they own lots of things, that’s what an asset management arm does), was used to smuggle a consignment of cocaine (which again, is nothing out of the ordinary, using container ships to illicitly transport cocaine is extremely common)
JP Morgan had nothing to do with either the attempted drug smuggling, or the operation of the cargo ship. No JP Morgan staff member was anywhere near the vessel. Their connection to the whole thing is nothing more than their name appearing on some financing documents for the ship.

I don’t think you really understand what you’re talking about. 
There is not a national currency left on earth that is still backed by gold or silver, and practically every legitimate/ credible financial expert is against a return to the Gold standard (a currency backed by gold). 
A currency backed by gold, or any commodity for that matter is far more susceptible to deflation - the opposite of inflation, which is incredibly damaging, economic activity slows down, people begin to hoard, the ‘real value’ of debt increases rather than decreases.

How about some disadvantages that show why it isn’t?
1) it’s anonymous.
Despite this frequently being touted as one of bitcoin’s key draw cards. It’s also probably the prime reason why it will never achieve mainstream acceptance in financial circles. Anonymity + large amounts of money = crime, is  pretty much anti-money laundering 101. Bitcoin’s unwanted association with the dark net drugs trade, and it’s status as the payment method of choice in ransomware hacks is a perfect testament of this.
2) it’s irreversible.
No matter how careful you are, everybody makes mistakes, and with their being no easy way to reverse a bitcoin transaction, this is a massive problem. No bank or financial institution is going to implement a payment system they can not reverse in the event of an employee making a simple mistake, like mixing up a destination wallet or incorrectly placing the decimal point.
3) it’s enormous energy consumption.
Even though bitcoin is currently only used by a tiny minority, it already consumes 0.5% of the world’s total energy usage. There is simply no way this is scalable in its current form.
4) it’s deflationary nature.
Again, this one is often touted as one of bitcoins benefits - that it has a fixed number of coins that can ever exist, and in a world with a continuously increasing population, this will cause the value of each bitcoin to perpetually increase (known as deflation) - the opposite of our currencies today that slowly erode in value (called inflation). And while to the uninitiated, the former obviously sounds like the better position to be in, any trained economist will tell you this is not the case, deflation is enormously damaging to an economy, it causes the true value of debt to increase, slows down economic activity as those with wealth opt to hoard it, which can lead to an extremely painful feedback loop.
@_date: 2019-11-28 01:38:37
No. It wasn’t.
But go ahead, cite your credible source that says otherwise.
@_date: 2019-11-09 05:42:49
Actually considering the market cap of bitcoin, the amount lost to scams / hacking / theft is far far greater than the conventional economy.
Who cares if you’ve never been able to use U.K. pounds in the US, nobody ever suggested that you could.
Your dreaming if you think the amount of merchants accepting bitcoin is increasing by any significant degree. 
“There’s only a very limited subset of things they can do”
Oh rly?
From your own link “Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations” - in other words completely kill the network by preventing all transactions from getting confirmed.
Bitcoin is going nowhere. The world doesn’t care.

Only if you’re a failed state with an imploding economy who’s government the U.K. no longer recognises.
This doesn’t apply to the 69+ other central banks they hold gold for, who specifically choose the Bank of England because of the impeccable reputation it has earned over the years, and there is nothing to suggest this is going to change anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-11-22 05:06:57
Which is of course outweighed by the fact they have a job that allowed them to earn that money in the first place.
You can be glad you don’t have a choice, and that people with a far greater insight and understanding of the matter made it for you because the alternatives would all see you in a significantly worse position.
It is not a coincidence that an inflation rate of 1-2% is considered the sweet spot and actively targeted by pretty much every developed economy on the planet. The barely perceivable erosion of value that an inflation rate of 1% per annum represents is unequivocally the lesser evil when compared to the alternative  - a currency continuously increasing in value as prices decrease, known as deflation, which to the financially inexperienced naturally sounds like the better option, but this is simply not the case.
Deflation is almost universally regarded negatively by economists as it dampens economic activity, reduces investment, increases the real-value of debt, and promotes hoarding which ultimately raises the level of economic disparity even further as liquid wealth accumulates in the hands of those with the means to hold it. In other words, the rich get richer even faster, while wage earners struggle even more.
Those with capital have less desire to invest it in new business ventures, as simply hanging onto it will see it’s value increase with zero risk, so less money is spent, which leads to lower production &amp; demand, which in turn leads to lower wages, causing even less money to spent... creating a vicious cycle or feedback loop known as a ‘deflationary spiral’ , which is widely considered to be one of the reasons the Great Depression was so difficult to break out from.

I can’t do a ‘simple internet search’ for something that doesn’t exist.
And neither can you, hence why you haven’t been able to and just dig your hole even further.
Nowhere does what you tried to suggest actually occur. Just like their were never any charges for JP Morgan to ‘Walk’ from in the first place.

If bitcoin is so secure and fiat is such a Wild West saloon, then why have their been of dozens of massive BTC thefts (practically all unresolved) due to hacking, insider fraud, and negligence? A Wall Street Journal estimated nearly $1.7 billion has been lost in cryptocurrency theft. 
As for fraud, the incidence of counterfeit Sterling banknotes is so tiny that you would have extremely unlucky to ever even see one in your lifetime, so call me reckless, but I’m not too bothered about that one.
Also, bitcoin might be ‘borderless’ in theory, in reality it’s penetration rate is so abysmal (not to mention static) that this is trivial. I can count on one hand the number of times I have been somewhere that accepted payment with bitcoin. While I have never had my Pounds Sterling refused anywhere in the UK, nor had any difficulty exchanging it in other countries, and i’ve been to some real backwaters...
Finally, calling fiat risky because it’s centralised? Lol you know over 70% of BTC mining occurs in China right? Mostly in a relatively small number of large farms. Do you realise how easy it would be for the PLA to just one day suddenly storm them all, gain a 51% control and then just zero the price?

Yeah I can confirm hearing something similar, was in a convince store a couple of months ago and the owner was fiddling around attaching some massive padlocks to a new machine , while explaining to another customer how his  previous ATM had been stolen. The old one was quite small and apparently some guy just walked in one day, went straight to the machine, picked it up and walked straight out again, as casual as anything. No idea how much was in it, but it’s common knowledge these things have a tremendous turnover in London...

Sorry this was a bitcoin atm in this case
