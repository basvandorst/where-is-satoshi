Something i found on web 
"Being a centralized bitcoin service does attract attention from state actors and other well funded pains in the butt, and as a matter of fact, we’ve been under DDoS since the first month we launched—over three years–yay. Plus we have put real fiat dollars into our lawyers’ pockets, to defend our customers from their own governments. This is not what we love to do, which is coding and delivering awesome services. "

The network byte is the first byte of input to base58 encoder.
For uncompressed keys the input is always 1 network byte (0x80) followed by 32-byte secret exponent, followed by a 4-byte checksum. For compressed keys there is an extra byte of 0x01 between the exponent and the checksum.
The prefixes '5', 'K' or 'L' are the result of the aforementioned constraints on the input data. If you plug in all 0x00 or all 0xff in the 32-byte exponent and convert it to base58, you will see that the private key must start with '5H...5K' for uncompressed and 'Kw...L5' for compressed.
