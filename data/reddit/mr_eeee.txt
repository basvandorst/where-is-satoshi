They should hate Mt. Gox and not bitcoin. That's like hating gold because the NASDAQ had a glitch. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:37:58
If they do it privately and change everything, maybe. Doing it publicly would be like telling everyone your house has Chinese drywall. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:18:43
No, because its probably either going to be all or nothing.

Ha, it happens it happens.

Dogecoin would be a safer bet then goxcoin imo. Now bitcoin thats a real investment. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:04:10






True. If you had a 50% of dying or getting a million dollars, would you take the risk? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:24:47
Do the bitcoins have rights now?

Whenever I hear the media say this, all I hear in my head is
"BUY BUY BUY."

Ah good point, overriding a bad rep with a good rep works. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:21:47
If they die they die. They should have done more homework, its a learning experience I guess.

Smart guy, putting a cap on the fiat and btc limit. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:22:36
I can't see any sane person doing business with them after/if they get their btc out. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:08:33
A lot of people think the same thing, only time will tell. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:43:24
Do you have anything in Mt Gox? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:41:39
I'm pretty sure the feds view bitcoin as assets just like money drugs and guns. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:59:23
That would undermine bitcoin itself. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 08:53:21
My favorite bitcoin youtube channel. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 10:20:23
Agreed that whatever rises out of the ashes of Mt. Gox should have as many options for fiat currencies if not more. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:59:10
The only confidence that should be shattered is with Mt Gox itself and those affiliated with it. Bitcoin is not the issue and should thrive. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:04:04
At current market price he would have 171 million USD 2% bitcoin's market cap.

No you deserve to be a billionaire. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 17:39:23
Was kind of insulted at what I got. .0001 btc. I guess my responses equated to one word "asdf" answers. Thanks anyway. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:38:01
Woo fear mongering! How refreshing!
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:41:34
Mt Gox won't allow people to withdraw fiat or bitcoin, basically an IOU. Now people are waiting to see if they are solvent, to get everyone who's in, back on the IOU.

In about a month when its all settled.

I personally wouldn't touch dogecoin, but its safer then goxcoin as of right now. 
@_date: 2014-03-29 15:03:25
I don't even like the kings, but I like that shirt so I bought one, 0.06016 btc including shipping. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 11:06:17
A 10 person protest is slowing down the progress for Mt Gox to fix technical issues? Excuses on top of excuses. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:41:51
100 does not equal below 100 like you said.

The Bildeburgs, Rockefellers, Trilateral Commission the Council on Foreign Relations, Freemasons, Bohemian Grove and Reptilians. Think that about covers them.

The dollar used to be backed by gold.

this is fun and frustrating at the same time 
@_date: 2014-02-22 12:44:47
I mean when you say there are three major exchanges BELOW $100 and make a list of major exchanges with only one below $100. What do you expect?
 I can't really read something that has been deleted.

I've never had a problem with BoA or Coinbase. I just bought some btc on Monday for $650 (which was a terrible time) they processed the transaction Tuesday and it will arrive in my Coinbase account Monday, after the 5 business days. As far as selling I sold .1 in December and got 87.50 credited to my account with no problems from BoA which also took 5 business days. 
@_date: 2014-02-18 09:26:23
I would agree if the other exchanges weren't going on strong right now. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:29:13
Rabid dogs? Fire hoses?

The number system, its easily abused gox owed over a trillion bitcoins according to the site at one point.

Pi equals 3.16, that doesn't make a difference? Its only .02 off.

At first I didn't have" bye", but after thinking about how the Japanese say it I went 2. 
@_date: 2014-03-09 11:56:13
You could have just handed them all $5 in btc and accomplished basically the same thing, giving one person that much money is ludicrous.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:15:05
Wow better off waiting 5 business days on Coinbase. The new version of that ATM probably implants a chip in your hand. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:15:25
The feds have a license to steal. Whether it be illegal drugs, guns, money, or now bitcoin, if they want something seized they seize it.   
@_date: 2014-02-21 14:45:03
Your arm will give out eventually. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 19:37:10
Well that site was quickly broken, you should probably force registered emails.
