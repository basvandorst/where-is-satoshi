You need to calculate which is better, taking the capital loss or a casualty loss, and then make sure you act appropriately.
If you lost BTC/LTC/ETH, then you exchanged them for x BFXCOIN at $0. You can take a capital loss for the original cost basis of your BTC/LTC/ETH (not their market value).
If you lost USD, you have just bought x BFXCOIN that are now worth nothing. However, you haven't incurred a capital loss yet (more likely a casualty) till you dispose of those tokens.
Capital losses can first reduce any other capital gains (e.g. stocks) down to zero, and then your income by $3,000 per tax year. Any remaining losses are carried forward into future years. You could be doing this over a long time.
A casualty loss is again the lost cost basis value, not the market value. However, each loss is reduced by $100 and then the total by 10% of your Adjusted Gross Income (AGI). So if you have a loss of $5,000 and earned $50k, your loss is $0.  The more you earn, the less loss you can claim. Losses are generally taken in the year they occur and cannot be rolled over.
If you get a payback for the BFXCOIN in the future (when you have claimed a loss), it will be treated as income.
You should take time to calculate your losses based on your circumstances and decide with your accountant the best way to proceed to maximize deductions.
edit: apparently BFXCOIN is trading, so not $0.
@_date: 2016-08-10 22:27:59
No, casualty losses are taken in the year of the loss. They don't roll over. You need to calculate if you'll get more as a casualty or capital loss.

Adding HD wallets is planned for later this year. This should allow easier tracking, but we can also look at adding imports for specific wallet exports.
Transfers aren't removed, just hidden. You can see them if you select the Transfer filter. If you have added two xPub for your two HD wallets, then any transfers would automatically be found. If not a transfer, it would get assigned as Spending or Income - till you confirm or correct it.
I'm looking into the plans going forward, but for now we have this year (i.e. 2016), the current filing year (2015) and then all historic.

It sounds like you just have $10,800 taxable income, might be income or gambling winnings. Declaring it as gambling is more complicated, since you would have to work out the USD value for each payout for your 1040.
The IRS will want to ensure you paid the correct (i.e. maximum) amount of tax. The only thing lower than income/gambling income tax is long-term capital gains rates. However, that doesn't sounds applicable from what you describe. Talk to your CPA again to confirm, but it does sound like you just need to declare it as misc or gambling income.
edit: asks a question about tax advice, get answers to pay taxes, panics and deletes account :)

You probably want to go and get real advice, since you have a few issues.
First, you might be considered a money services business (MSB), for which you need a license. You are essentially in the business of buying and selling bitcoin to other people for profit. They has been a recent case where someone using localbitcoins.com got into legal trouble for the same problem.
Tax. You need to be paying capital gains on those profits. Also, you are likely acting as a self-employed business. So when someone buys from you, it's income, and you will be paying self-employed income taxes. Both these have to be declared on your tax forms for the tax year you operated. You may also need to register with your state as a self-employed business.
Coinbase are a bank, and so they are obliged to ask Know-Your-Customer type questions, including these. I've been asked them too. Depending on your answers, you will risk having them shutdown your account (you won't lose your money/coins).
tl:dr; speak to an attorney in your state and get legal advice
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:34:11
Technically, you are supposed to report all tax events, e.g. all crypto trading. You would still need to report your trades that resulted in gains, but you would also want to include your loss trades so you can sum them over the tax year.
If this totals to a loss, then declare it, since it is a tax deduction and can be used to reduce any other capital gains you might have and up to $3k income per year. The remainder carries forward to other years.
@_date: 2018-01-07 06:16:15
What personal details?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:05:00
Sell some. You should be tax planning by putting aside a portion of any profits periodically, or as you trade.

Alas, the online version of TurboTax doesn't support file importing, so all you can do is type it in. Otherwise, you need the download/CD version of TurboTax. From there, it's pretty easy. Click File -&gt; Import.., choose the file and follow instructions.
The TXF can also be imported into H&amp;R Block.

You are just asking, "can I get away with committing tax fraud?"
If you are audited and cannot show your basis, the IRS could take the worst case, which is a zero cost short-term basis. i.e. it'll all be taxed as income.
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:49:08
As long as you don't mind not getting long-term tax rates.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:34:42


If you actually read the tax attorney's opinion, then you would know that's not true.
@_date: 2017-12-08 23:01:25
Obviously no on first questions.


It's not a gift if you have an expectation of something in return. Plus, as this would be over $14k you would owe gift taxes (as the giftor). Then that Porsche you receive would be income too.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:38:52
Assuming US. No, not for you, as long as you don't go over the gift threshold (~$14k in total per person per year) otherwise you will pay the gift tax.
You can transfer the cost basis to them too (or max. of cost basis and fair market value), which means they can claim the long-term rate when they sell. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:18:27


If you sell stocks, made a profit, reinvest it all, you still made a profit and have capital gains/losses. This is no different. Just because you didn't plan for taxes effectively isn't an excuse to not pay them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:57:41
You're wrong, doesn't matter where they are stored.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:43:09
Depends why you are moving them.
If you are moving coins to an exchange to trade, then like wire fees, you could add the fee to your own cost basis as part of the trade.
If you are moving coins to spend them, then you include the fee as part of the value. e.g. You buy something worth $100 and you need to send 0.01 BTC plus a 0.0005 fee, you would use 0.0015 as $100.
If you are just moving coins from wallet to wallet, then, yes, you are just paying a fee for a service at fair market value. You would need to check if you have gains/losses, although they would most likely be negligible or round down to $0.
@_date: 2017-12-08 06:29:34
You really need to correct your records. I suggest looking at the end of year balances and make them tie up to what you actually had.
If you spent coins, but can't remember when or how much. Make your best guess. It's import to remove those cost basis coins else you run into the problem you now have.
Make them as spend on a date in those past years. Put them in as "lost" if you just don't have them anymore. But do work to correct balances.
@_date: 2017-12-11 06:32:50
No. You still pay sales tax if applicable. You also could pay capital gains tax on any capital gains income if the coins you used to purchase the t-shirt have increased in value. i.e. price of t-shirt - cost of those BTC = capital gain.
The amount of tax you pay depends of other things, such as your other income and how long you held your coins. Could be from nothing to your standard tax rate.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:35:36
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:49:19
First-In First-Out. You sell the coins you owned the longest first, so any profit is difference between their price (e.g. $1000) and what you sell for. Keep repeating till you've used everything up.
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:41:21
Nice to hear. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:47:32


You do. You still sold the original investment.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:18:04
Buying, nothing. Spending is like selling, so you have potential capital gains taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:22:20

PM me your account login. I can't give tax advice, but I can check there aren't any glaring issues.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:25:08
You're (most likely) wrong.
When you "swap", you are disposing of an asset for fair market value, for which you are able to acquire another asset. Disposing of any property is a tax event.
The only time it might not be, is if you were allowed to classify it as a 1031 exchange, defering the gains and transferring the cost basis - by filing an 8824. Opinions differ, but most accountants don't believe it would be allowed. And the new tax law changes things to only allow it for real property, so it definitely won't be next year.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:46:09


The remaining 0.9 BTC would keep its original cost basis (time and price, i.e. 2 months ago @ $1000 BTC/USD). So you would wait for 10 more months and you could sell it using long-term rates.
@_date: 2017-12-04 17:36:00
Yes, it doesn't matter where your coins or USD are stored, gains/losses on all transactions are reported and summed for the year.
@_date: 2017-12-03 18:12:31
Well, you disposed of a property (Bitcoin), from which you profited.
Your argument that all crypto are "like" and so can be treated as a 1031 exchange is pretty weak. This doesn't apply for personal use. Why would the IRS give away taxes like this. They clearly aren't the same. If, as the IRS states, a car is not "like" a truck, then BTC is not likely like LTC. The new likely tax law only allows 1031 for real property.
You basically made a profit that you reinvested. That profit is taxable income.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:18:49


No. And negligence is not tax deductible and not a capital loss.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:06:02
If you get audited, all you can do is show what records you have to prove your position. The IRS makes a claim, and in these instances you are guilty until you can prove your innocence. You would likely get a CPA/tax attorney and they'll give you the best advice on how to proceed. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:13:46
Despite what anyone says, no one can tell you for sure. Many accountants believe not, but some argue it could. Speak to you own tax professional for their advice. Or, file conservatively by assuming it can't.
If the new proposed tax law passes, it will not be allowed next year, as it is limited to real estate.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:42:49
1. Yes, you have gains. You made a profit of $800, which is taxable capital gains income. You will include this in your 1040 Schedule D.
2. No, it doesn't matter. It's still your account. You need to file.
3. If the coins you sell are owned for more than a year, then they would be long-term. You would have to track the cost basis and all your trades to know this. You can use our site,  which does this for you.
4. Yes, if you made a profit. Whenever you sell, work out the gains and put the estimated tax amount aside. This is basic tax planning, because you don't want a shock at the end of the year.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:55:14
Potentially. However, in reality, your purchase of a cup of coffee would  unlikely generate more than $0.50 gains and due to rounding wouldn't be included in your tax forms.
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:52:25


That is absolutely not true. You have capital gains income to report.
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:05:05


It's no different. They have to work out the gains/losses made from selling and what they bought. If the coins they are selling have been owned for more than a year, then they can claim long-term rates, otherwise it's taxed as income.
@_date: 2015-12-31 02:50:36
It's gambling income, which is included in your tax return (Form 1040 Line 21). You will have to use the equivalent USD value (i.e. BTC won * daily BTC price). If you use a website that does free returns for you (e.g. taxact/taxslayer) then they typically ask and put it in the right place.
Gambling income is taxed like normal income, and if that's all the income you have, it may be less than your standard deduction and personal exception (about $10k) so you may owe no taxes. Put your figures into one of those websites and you'll see.
You can also deduct your gambling losses, but only up to the amount of any winnings in that tax year.
@_date: 2015-12-17 20:53:19
(USA) As far as tax goes, first, there is no tax for you at that amount - a giftor pays gift tax on something over $14k.
For them, and when they come to sell those coins, they could be liable for capital gains (the difference betwen what they sell them for and what they cost). However, again, the amount is small and so would not have little if any effect. While any gains they make would be treated as capital gains income, it depends on their tax status at the time as well as other income, whether they owed anything (or their parents).
However, you should still transfer the "cost basis" to them. This just means telling them (with proof) of when and how much you bought the coins for. The reason is that when they come to sell, they can use this as their basis and so reduce gains. Otherwise, they might have to take it as 100% short-term gains.
Other tax rules may apply in other countries.
tl:dr; because it's a small amount, no taxes.
@_date: 2015-06-05 21:48:46
There are no sales tax on Bitcoin, as you are buying a digital currencies and not goods. It is like buying a gift card. You will pay sales tax on the goods/services that you subsequently buy with those Bitcoins, like you would with a gift card.
However, sales tax is up to the individual States not the federal government, and some could well decide to treat digital currencies differently and charge tax. There are some countries actually doing this, e.g. Australia.
@_date: 2017-12-07 22:49:06
The IRS don't care what you do with the money that you gained. You are buying back with more than you would have been able to originally, because you have additional income. Income is taxable.
It's quite possible to have gains and owe taxes without having the cash. You would have to liquidate some of your assets to cover the tax bill. This is why when you sell you always take away the tax portion so it isn't re-invested (and you lose track).
@_date: 2015-12-12 05:04:30
You can receive some large sums of USD without reporting income, gifts, for instance. So it also depends why you are receiving money, property, as well as how much.
Remember, the US tax system is an honor system. You earn money and declare it. The IRS is responsible for tax collection, which includes fraud investigation. Bitcoin alone is difficult, until you turn it into fiat currency. Then a large sum will likely be picked up in standard fraud checks and your account may be flagged for review.
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:45:10
Yes. If you disposed of any coins, to cash, spending or another alt-coin, you have to work out and report gains/losses. (US at least). It doesn't matter where they are. The amount of tax you pay depends on other things, such as your income level.
@_date: 2015-12-21 18:35:34
Any income in Bitcoin is treated as income in USD for tax purposes. The fact you were paid in Bitcoin is irrelevant.
If you did a job for $1000 and were paid in BTC, you have $1000 income.
If you did a job and were just paid 3 BTC, you would need to work out the 3 * daily price, which is then your USD income.
Once you have those coins, that income value also sets their cost basis. When you come to sell you will have capital gains/losses.
Spending is the same as selling. If you spend those BTC, you are taxed as if you sold them for that amount in USD. Buying a $100 gift card with BTC, you sold x BTC for $100, so capital gains/losses apply.
@_date: 2015-12-15 17:20:39
Here's your solid source [IRS Notice 2014-21](
Spending is treated like selling, so you need to calculate any potentials capital gains (or losses). There is no limit on capital gains, with exception that any gains under $0.50 will get rounded down to zero.
[Bitcoin.Tax]( has some information, as  does this [post]( from a tax lawyer, which is still relevant.
@_date: 2015-12-12 07:02:36
When you trade within Bitstamp, or any exchange, there are also no on-chain transactions, but it is still a tax event. You are exchanging capital property for currency value.
Shift is treated no different. You bought BTC at some price, they are in your wallet, you then spend those BTC by exchanging them for USD via Coinbase/Shift. Gains could be realized and those gains are taxable.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:57:51
In addition to other information in this thread, here is some [relevant Bitcoin tax information](
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:30:44
TurboTax doesn't have anything specific to Bitcoin, but they do have Schedule D, which is used to report capital gains.
You can import your data into bitcoin.tax and then export out a file that can be imported into TurboTax (last year, they only supported their desktop version - whereas TaxACT online works).


This is true, if you haven't spent any other coins and can show that they are physically separate, i.e. never mixed in the same accounts or wallets. Otherwise, if you spend Bitcoin and bought new ones, you have potential gains/losses as it is difficult to show a clear boundary.
@_date: 2015-12-12 02:57:57
Yes. Spending is treated no different than selling as far as US capitals gains are concerned. If you only use Coinbase, they can provide a tax infomation, which I imagine would include the USD value of any Shift transactions.
But if you've bought/traded coins elsewhere, you'll need another way to calculate your gains from those cost basis.
@_date: 2015-12-18 20:30:02
First, you are responsible for keeping your own records. That is always the IRS/tax office argument.
If you don't have the data (nether do they) then you have to make best guesses and assumptions. If you got audited, they would review your cost basis and gains. If you couldn't show your positions, they would likely change it do the least favorable, i.e. short-term 100% gains instead of any long-term benefits.

@_date: 2015-12-12 06:58:43
If you have your Shift card attached to a Bitcoin wallet(as opposed to the Coinbase USD account) then yes, it's a tax event.
You are effectively transacting Bitcoins for other property of value. In the eyes of the IRS, it's not different than selling Bitcoin, and so you need to work out potential capital gains (or losses).
@_date: 2014-09-29 06:32:16
You'll report bitcoin trading losses like any other capital gains/losses on your 1040 Schedule D. Keep records because you'll have to fill in Form 8949, specifying each sale with the proceeds and cost basis.
Your losses can offset other gains you've made (in stocks for example) and up to $3k of your income per tax year. Any remaining losses you have will have to be carried forward into future years until they are all included.
Shouldn't be too complicated to work out if you bought and sold everything in the same year, since it's all short-term losses. Your loss is simply the total you spent less what you sold for, plus any fees you might have incurred in those trades.
If you have coins from previous years, used different exchanges, or bought/sold alt-coins, you can check out [ that works out capital gains and losses.

There are definitely some issues and the IRS needs to issue guidance, but until then it seems most people are treating them as capital assets.
So any gains you make whenever you convert to USD are taxable.
Any purchases should are considered a tax event, and so any gains between the fair price and cost basis are taxable. This is one of the major issues, as we are taxing something that acts like a currency. As usage increases, reporting and calculating this will become very difficult.
If you bought Bitcoins but didn't sell or spend any, there's no tax.
If you sold some, spent some, there might well be tax to pay.
If you have traded across multiple exchanges, bought and sold a lot, traded alt-coins, it suddenly gets more complicated. I wrote something to work out my own taxes, and then made it into [bitcointaxes.info](

No one really knows if the IRS would accept it during an audit. But it's the best you could get. YOu'll have something at least, without anything I'd worry they would just ignore all losses.
But even if you don't get audited, trying to calculate the cost basis of a Bitcoin is not simple after you have done lots of trading!
@_date: 2014-12-18 05:41:38
You should definitely look into if you can generate a loss. Although be careful not too much as you cannot declare more than $3k capital losses against your income per year. The remainder carries forward.
1. Wash sales (US only) do not apply to Bitcoin.
2. You will reset your cost basis on those coins, so you will have to wait for another full year before you get the reduced long-term tax rate if and when you do sell/spend them.
3. You will likely lose some money as the buy price will be more than the sell price, and you likely have fees both way.
You can import your data and run scenarios at 
@_date: 2014-04-10 05:30:49
For the US, following the IRS Notice, mined coins are immediate income.
That means you need to work out the fair value in USD and declare it. So say you mined 1,000,000 DOGE today, you then have income of $420, and will pay income tax on that.
If you are a business, or self-employed, you can deduct your mining costs for the year to reduce your tax burden.
Your 1m DOGE then each have a cost basis of $0.00042 going forward for when you do sell them.
@_date: 2014-02-07 23:02:49
Fair enough, but I was really thinking of trades. For instance, if you have 10 BTC on Bitstamp, and want to sell 5, you can't choose which 5. If they were stocks, and you had opted for Specific Identification, you could elect the actual stocks.
@_date: 2014-04-06 02:49:12
If you traded during 2013 by just buying and selling BTC, but left yourself 100% in BTC at the end, then unfortunately you still owe taxes even though you don't have the cash in your account.
What you have done is effectively increase the cost basis of the coins you own, so when you do come to sell, you'll make less profits and pay less taxes, or actually make a loss and get money back (through deductions)
If you only traded alt-coins, be aware we consider alt-coin trading a tax event. This is based on advice of this [tax attorney]( He mentions that they are probably not "like-kind" and might not pass the test to be, and even if they did, could take several years to resolve. So it is prudent to ensure your don't underpay and treat it this way.
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:21:11
The $600 is a business reporting requirement, it has absolutely nothing to do with personal spending or capital gains.
There is no exemption for capital gains, except long-term rates and if you make a gain of less than $0.50 it is rounded to zero on your tax forms.
@_date: 2014-03-03 19:49:46
You are absolutely right, and we do definitely need absolute guidance. However, I really see nothing that suggests they are going to come up with anything before April 15, so right now many people are filing in good faith or as conservatively as possible.
Most advice is to treat it as a capital asset, given that it really isn't anything else. So you would report any gains as different in sale proceeds and cost basis including differentiating short/long term.
However, I have read some people do intend to file it as currency, but this is more because it would be treated as income and therefore they would pay the maximum possible tax. The idea that if they got audited, they would have not underpaid.
One thing is clear, you will have to file something if you have made gains in 2013.

As you are a US citizen, you pay a worldwide income tax to the US. However, since you are domiciled abroad, and Israel has a tax treaty with the US, you are able to claim foreign tax credits to make sure you don't pay taxes twice. You need to look into this part further for the specifics.
For reporting your US taxes, you will just treat your Bitcoin paycheck as income in equivalent dollars the day you receive it, either based on your salary (e.g. you are being paid $2,000 but in BTC, then your income is $2,000), or if being paid 3BTC, then based on the Bitcoin daily price. IRS doesn't know or care about Bitcoin for income. To them it's just an equivalent dollar amount.
Once you own those Bitcoins, they become your property and have a cost basis of the amount you declared as income and on that date. When you sell or spend it will just be treated as capital gains and taxed accordingly.
@_date: 2014-05-04 06:41:11
It's capital gains. You can use  to work out how to declare.
@_date: 2014-05-05 02:43:06
First, the quote you referenced does say that. "Specific share identification" is LIFO. Or HCFO. Or ACFO. Or CCFO. Any way you want to pick each share.
However, the quote also only related to Mutual funds.
Bitcoins are property and so follow such rules. Right now there is no specific guidance to say how they should be treated, and to be honest, professional opinions differ.
You might file using LIFO and be fine. Or, the IRS might clarify and you may have to recalculate your past taxes.

The IRS doesn't want you claiming your losses early whilst still holding the stock. You can see their point, but as you say, you would only otherwise be deferring them.
Personally, I'm glad they probably don't apply.
@_date: 2015-12-14 17:53:07
That's correct. Gains are the difference between the amount you sell/spend them and how much you bought them for. And you only have taxes if you made gains. If you haven't sold or spent any in 2015, there is nothing to put on your taxes.
You do of course need to keep a record of how much your bought the coins, for when you do come to spend them.


If you are talking about spending, then that's no different than selling, and is a tax event. You need to work out potential gains.
@_date: 2014-07-08 15:34:19
You just need to keep records in case you get audited. It will be on your to prove your position (with IRS you are guilty until proven innocent). Download your trade history from wherever you trade. If in person, issue and keep a receipt.
@_date: 2014-05-05 04:51:10
The point is a wallet doesn't know how old your coins are, only how long it has held them. You might have purchased them earlier from elsewhere. This is why a single wallet can't itself make tax related decisions.
Buy 1 BTC from MtGox in Apr 2013.
Buy 2 BTC from Coinbase in Nov 2013.
Transfer my 1 BTC from my MtGox wallet to my Coinbase wallet in Dec 2013.
The wallet could see the 2 BTC as the oldest, which is incorrect without additional cost basis information.
So not a setting to spend your newest/oldest coins, but to allow you to choose which to spend.
@_date: 2014-03-29 23:51:16
This doesn't give you a cost basis though, you might have been given them or bought them for under market price. So with no documentation they could assume it to be zero, and so the whole value is gains.
Your documentation for an audit will likely be your bank records, exchange trade history, your bitcoin wallet and the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-12-04 18:43:12
Yes, in the US spending Bitcoin would trigger a tax event, as you are effectively selling for coins for a cash equivalent and using that to purchase the cards.
So what matters here is the amount of gain you made. For this you need to know the cost you bought those coins at, when, then the value of the cards you purchased.
So say you bought $100 worth of gift cards today using 0.27 BTC (price is $373/BTC), but you had bought those 0.27 BTC a while ago for $95 (price was $350/BTC). You have made $5 capital gains income.
* This gets reported on Schedule D of your 1040. You can enter it in TurboTax in the Capital Gains section.
* If you had own those coins for a year or less, the tax rate is just you normal tax. So that $5 gain is added to the rest of your income and your tax bill is calculated as normal.
* If the had owned them for more than a year, they are long-term gains and you get a discounted tax rate. The rate is 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your other income. Again, TurboTax will deal with this as long as you enter the dates.
* Any gains less than $0.50 can be ignored, as the tax forms round to the nearest dollar. So if you had only bought a $5 gift card in the above example your gain would have only been $0.25.
If you can't get the original cost from the records, you would have to estimate it at least based on  your bank records of sending money to the exchange in the first place.
I'm not sure I understand the question on your loan.

In the US, there is no depreciation, rather you claim it as capital losses, but only when you realize the loss (i.e. sold or spent them). 
If you bought 1 BTC for $1000 and sold it for $600, you have a capital loss of $400 that can be offset against any other gains you made, or up to $3,000 of your income in that tax year. If your losses are more than $3k, they are carried forward into future years.
edit: AUS? If so, likely that it will be treated as capital losses too.
@_date: 2014-03-29 21:01:59
That $3k is the MAXIMUM you can offset any losses you made against your income. It isn't some magic deduction you can use against profits you made.
If you bought 1 BTC for 500 and sold for 800, you made 300 gains, which is taxable at 0%, 15% or your marginal income rate, all depending on your circumstances. That's it.
If, however, you bought 1 BTC at 800 and sold at 500, you made a 300 loss. You can deduct that against your ordinary income to reduce your tax burden.
But if you bought 20 BTC at 800 and sold at 500, making a loss of 6000, you can only deduct up to 3000 this year and the rest has to carry forward till next year.

No, gambling winnings in the UK are tax-free. The company running the gambling is taxed and there are changes coming into force on 1st Dec 2014.

Make sure you sell before 31st Dec if you want to take losses for this year. You can buy right back again if you want.
Declare your sales on your 1040 Schedule D, giving the cost basis and proceeds from each sale. This gives your losses as it would have any gains.
They can be used to offset tax on any other capital gains you might have made, from stocks for example. Otherwise if can up to $3k can be used to reduce your taxable income for the year, with the remaining carried forward to future years.

@_date: 2014-03-21 19:31:05
You shouldn't just choose a date.
If you got audited and you can't prove a date, it will become the sale date with zero cost basis, and it will become short term gains. This means you'll have underpaid your taxes, as you'll owe more, so possible have a penalty too.
@_date: 2014-12-28 19:00:05
You're right, there's no gain. But there are still losses and if you declare them you can reduce your taxes for the year.
There are no limits for capital gains, except you round to the nearest dollar, so gains less than $0.50 are ignored. The $600 is a business reporting requirement and not relevant to gains.

You can vote, or run yourself.
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:32:46
Of course, this only applies to your 2014 taxes, which will be filed in 2015.
Also remember you can only claim  the "cost basis" of those coins, not what they were worth at the time of the loss. So if you had bought 1 BTC for $100 back in April, your capital loss is only $100.
This year, in filing your 2013 taxes, you can calculate the cost basis of each coin and could use specific identification (as opposed to FIFO) to determine your gains for 2013, and then carry forward the remaining cost basis into next year. That way you can claim the losses on the either the expensive coins, or at least up to the $3,000 limit per year.
In the last couple of weeks I had been reminding people to download their MtGox trade history, as it's the only documentation you'll have to show the cost of your trades. This is case you get audited. Otherwise any coins could be treated with a cost basis of zero (i.e you pay more taxes) but also losses will be zero.
For this year, use [ to calculate your capital gains and then have it can carry forward your closing positions and costs basis for 2014.

@_date: 2014-04-11 07:27:13
Transfer between coins is a most likely tax event, so you do need to calculate gains. 
(The IRS has not explicitly clarified, but they do say transfer of "property" - in this case any crypto-coin - is subject to gains. Many accountants believe this is the case)
When you buy the LTC for BTC, you work out the fair value in USD, calculate any gains/losses you made in BTC and then transfer the cost basis into the new LTC. Same thing when you convert back.
Exactly why I wrote [ to work all this out, especially the cross-coin trades and show the final gain. (BTC only is free, but cross-coin calculations are a premium feature).
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:49:10
This 600 thing needs to stop. There is no limit on capital gains. The $600 is a requirement for businesses to report a 1099-MISC form to the supplier and IRS, it has nothing to do with capital gains.

Sometimes. Often I'll see the higher posts to tax related threads as "bitcoin /= taxes" or "I'm not paying mine ha ha". I tried to avoid engaging.
I think it's just the younger and more vocal side of the community being naive and immature. You can't expect cryptocurrencies to become accepted and mainstream by industry and governments, but yet be seen as a tax avoidance scheme. If they want Bitcoin to be taken as a serious currency, they need to accept the reality that it will be regulated and taxed.
That's not to say governments are doing it right. Personally, I think the IRS is wrong in how they tax mining income, for instance, and I also think cryptos are a new-breed of currency that cannot simply be put into existing frameworks of "property" or "currency". It's something new . However, it'll take time before they themselves adapt to be able to deal with it.
@_date: 2014-03-28 18:04:07
There is no personal allowance for CG. You are thinking of up to the ordinary 25% income tax rate, which means you would be paying 0% on long-term capital gains rather than the 15% for higher rate earners.
Short-term gains are taxed as income.
The IRS is specific about capital gains, ["You must report all capital gains."]( However, materiality (a decision between you and your tax professional) may be relevant if you bought one $8 coffee last year. But if you bought an $8 coffee everyday, it could be important.


This would be impractical (if not impossible) because the vendor needs to know the cost basis of the coins that you are spending, which they don't, and shouldn't, because you would need to make your whole portfolio public.

It's up to you of course, but it's tax fraud.


You don't have to declare purchases. Only gains made from selling.
You'll put the Sells into your Schedule D Form 8949 under part 2, ticking F, as you don't have a 1099.
Enter the dates you bought the coins, how much they cost, how much you sold them for, and the difference less any transaction fees.

They are already taxed. When you sell or spend Bitcoins you should be determining your gains and including them in your tax year's capital gains calculation.
The issue is that it being more and more used like a currency, rather than a trade unit, makes calculating and reporting gains extremely impractical.

No problem. Gains are $260 (if I interpreted what you said right), but your tax liability depends on your circumstances: how long you held the coins and what your ordinal tax rate is. 
@_date: 2014-04-12 08:44:32
A gift or donation is a transfer at cost, so if you Bought at $10, you give it away (Sell) at $10. You transfer the cost basis to the new owner. It should be a zero gain.
Spends are Sells, for the total amount in fiat.
For taxes, think about it as all in one big pot, not in wallets. But if you spend, you need to record it.
For capital gains purposes, cold wallets are irrelevant. Just enter the trades, and whenever you bought anything with BTC.
All this is in the free version for BTC. Alt-coins are premium.

@_date: 2014-07-21 21:03:32
Buying and selling BTC is taxed as normal capital gains. If you were trading and sold at a loss, then you can claim capital losses.
Gambling losses can only be offset against gambling winnings. Your winnings are taxed as income, but any losses can reduce that reported income, but only that type of income. So if you lost more than your won, you can't claim the losses in any way for tax purposes.
@_date: 2014-06-25 00:40:32
It's a good question, and there is no real definitive answer yet as the IRS hasn't clarified the position. But you can imagine that the IRS aren't just going to give this away.
It will be interesting to see the outcome of any appeals from audits. Although don't hold your breath, it might take a few years.
Tax attorney in his [post  said:


Opinion is essentially "possibly". File as such in good faith but be prepared to pay extra if it is ruled against you. Or, be prudent and pay it now and get a refund if things change.
edit: from what I understood in your circumstances, you were in receipt of the USD and so it would fail to be "like-kind"
@_date: 2014-10-19 08:05:05
You can do it two ways:
1) Each trade between property is a tax event. When you bought your n ALTCOIN with your 5 BTC, you are taxed as if you sold 5 BTC for x USD and then used that to buy the n ALTCOIN. The x USD is the price of BTC that day. So if you made a gain here, it needs to be reported. 
Similarly, when you traded your ALTCOIN back into BTC, you sold those ALTCOIN for USD bought back BTC. You need to work out if you made a gain or loss.
Finally selling you BTC, calculate any gains since that last trade.
2) Carry the cost basis over to the altcoin, then back.
This is where you consider each crypto-currency has "like-kind" treatment and so pass the cost basis over with each trade. This is how gains from real estate is handled, but normally an exchange of property is a tax event. We simply don't know if the IRS will allow this because of the lack of details in their clarification.
So your gain becomes the proceeds from selling your 15 BTC less the cost of the original 5 BTC purchase.
Be aware that if you do it this way, you may need to recalculate it all and owe the difference in the future.

This exists already. [ ]( The current version tracks trading from various exchanges to calculate gains, but can also be used to enter spending and including within gains calculations.
Our new version, [ will be live in the next few days and has a new dedicated section for including spending from Coinbase, Blockchain.info, and the Core wallet, as well as calculating income from mining for a huge number of altcoins.
Using Libratax can cause all kinds of problems and incorrect calculations, as it tries to use the blockchain to work out market rates. However, just because you transferred a coin doesn't mean you spent or bought it. So, unfortunately, when it sees transfers as a "Sell", you are paying taxes when you shouldn't. And the date isn't necessarily the date of your action, so the rate is wrong. Plus it doesn't know about fees, so again, more unnecessary taxes. Anyone who uses exchanges and done a lot of trading or spending would need to make a lot of manual corrections and additions.
BitcoinTaxes uses the raw exports from the exchanges and wallets, only supplementing the blockchain data when needed to get an estimated price. The exception rather than the rule.

As the rules stand right now, you have to report every time you make any money from disposing of a cryptocoin. There is no limit or threshold for capital gains, everything counts.
So if you buy something with Bitcoin, you need to keep a record of the date, how much is was is USD, how many BTC you spent. You do this because you need to reconcile it against how much that BTC cost you in the first place. The difference is your gain, which is taxable.
If you bought something for $256 for, say, 0.5 BTC. And let's also say you originally bought that 0.5 BTC for $10 last year. You have just made $246 profit, which is taxed as capital gains income.
Instead, if you had only just bought that 0.5 BTC for $255.75. In that case you only made $0.25 capital gains income. If this was put on a tax form, all values are rounded to the nearest dollar, it would be zero and gets ignored, and so in this case it wouldn't be reported. However, you wouldn't know this unless you track everything, and that's what you should record all your spending.
@_date: 2014-03-30 20:48:13
If you sell or spend, then you potentially owe taxes. You have to report it at least.
The tax is on the difference between what you sold it for and what you received it for. If you don't know how much they cost, then it's zero. So your whole sale is gains.
So find out from them the cost basis (how much they paid for them and when), because it can be transferred with a gift. That way you don't have to start at zero, it isn't all treated as gains, and you only pay tax on the difference in sell and buy price.
edit: since you said you sold them at the same price they were bought, you'll have zero gains, so no tax. You are still supposed to include them in your Scheduled D.
@_date: 2014-03-17 16:18:46
Well, if you made a purchase, you would enter the total price of transaction, which would be the fair value of what you bought. So no need in that case to look up exchange data.
For example, say you own 1 BTC, which you bought for $500. You then use it to buy a $100 gift card from Gyft for 0.16 BTC. That means you "sold" part of your BTC for an effective price of $625/BTC. You made a gain of $20 on that 0.16 BTC (as it cost you $80 initially).
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:43:41
Given there is no guidance, you should probably treat it as a general asset.
Therefore, in the same way you are expected to pay taxes on any gains, you can claims losses against those gains and up to the $3,000 limit.
However, you can only claim losses on the cost basis of the coins. If you can't show the costs basis, the IRS could say they have a zero basis, so no losses.
If you had downloaded your MtGox trade history you have probably the best documentary evidence you could get to show this, and then you can also work out the costs basis for what was lost.
@_date: 2014-12-04 23:06:31
Yes, it's all just for accounting anyway, as you can't actually select the explicit coins to spend, so you just remove the numbers from your totals.
So if you use First-In-First-Out then when you spent a coin, you'd nominally take the oldest one you have and it's cost basis.
Of course it might be more tax advantageous to use one closest to the sale price to minimize any gains. Or, even use the most expensive one to maximize losses. All depends on your circumstances.
I'm looking into the loan thing, mainly because I don't know if the interest you would owe can be used to offset any gains you might make if the value of the BTC you were loaned (and spent) increased. But otherwise I don't believe there are any tax implications.
@_date: 2014-12-21 06:09:17
Bitcoin being VAT exempt or not is irrelevant.
That decision is whether Bitcoin is a digital product/service and therefore should have VAT when you buy it. So, like digital music, VAT is charged on top. e.g. buy £100 worth of Bitcoin, pay £120. Or, is it like a gift card, where you only pay £100 but would pay any VAT when you spend it.
Using cash, credit card, or Bitcoin to buy something doesn't change the amount the vendor will charge you. If you, the buyer, are located in a VAT country, you will be charged VAT on the purchase. If you decide to pay in Bitcoin, so be it, you still pay the VAT.
If you are trying to suggest that a vendor avoid paying VAT just because they accept Bitcoin, then this is VAT fraud, which is not new. A vendor can obviously decide not to charge VAT or even charge it but not report it. They can do this with cash, credit cards, paypal or any other payment method. If they were audited it would like be checked (you can't exactly hide your payment methods).
So all you're left with is having a customer lie when they place the order and saying they live outside of Europe (for example) so there is no VAT. But the vendor is still doing what they are required and asking for the information.

Nothing changed, although we'll have to wait for the full guidance before knowing for sure.
Till then still consider crypto-coins as being subject to capitals gains tax, although you get a £10,900 allowance and then it is 18% or 28% of anything over, depending on your income.
@_date: 2014-11-13 16:43:48
If you purchase anything, for tax purposes, it is treated as if you had sold those Bitcoins for the equivalent amount in $, and so any gains you made are taxable.
Obviously what you need to know is how much that bitcoin cost you in the first place and when you received it. The difference is your gain (or loss).
So, say you bought 1 BTC on 22nd Sep 2014 for $400, and then today spent that 1 BTC buying something worth $430. You made $30 capital gains, which would be reported in your 1040 Schedule D. Since you owned the coin for less than a year, it is treated as income and so taxed at your normal rate.
If you had bought that coin in Sep 2013, it would be long-term capital gains, and still reportable but the tax rate is discounted rate between 0% to 20% depending on your other income.
You can ignore any gains less than $0.50 per transaction, since all figures are rounded to the nearest whole dollar on the tax forms.
There are really two approaches to tracking the original cost basis. First, use two wallets. One where you keep coins that you know you won't spend/sell for more than a year, and the other where you spend them more frequently. When spending from the latter you'll take an average of what's in there and always include it as short term gains.
Secondly, use a service like ours, [ where you can upload your trading history (as well as income/spending/mining in version 2 at [ ) that can then work out the cost basis of all your coins and report the exact gain when you spend or sell anything.
Hope that's useful.

@_date: 2014-05-28 04:53:50
No problem. Hopefully it's helped.
Personally, I just don't even worry about short term gains from spending. It's negligible, I keep records so I can work it out, and in the end I'm only paying more taxes because I actually made a profit. Fair enough.

If you are filing this year, but still stuck on how to calculate capital gains for your trades across multiple exchanges and multiple alt-coins, [bitcointaxes]( will help.
You can import trade histories from:
* MtGox
* Coinbase
* Bitstamp
* BTC-e
* Cryptsy
* Bitfinex
* Bitfloor
* CampBX
* LocalBitcoins
and it will calculate your capital gains for all trades, showing the data ready to be included on Schedule D Form 8949.
It is free for BTC in 2013, and a premium version for alt-coins, cross-coin trading and exporting for TurboTax or TaxACT.

The UK tax office had this crazy notion to make exchanges charge sales tax (VAT) on all bitcoin trades. Fortunately, the bitcoin community met with them and together agreed a better framework, which undid that decision.
This then is their brief on how Bitcoin is treated with regard to UK sales tax. Essentially, there is none for trading, Normal sales tax still exists when you sell a product or service and take bitcoin as payment.
Doesn't really affect anyone outside of the UK.

Your gains are calculated using FIFO as the default. It is no different that any other asset.


Yes, it is on you to keep records. You need to report every coin you get via mining as income on its fair value.
What did you expect? Free money?


It is exactly what I was expecting. Yes, it is complicated to work out costs basis, but not impossible.
I think their rulings will evolve as the use of crypos evolve. But they had to start somewhere.
@_date: 2014-12-18 06:23:13
They mean the cost basis will get reset into short-term from long-term if you sell/spend within the next 12 months. So selling coins next year at a profit would have had a 0% or 15% tax rate, whereas if you create a tax loss now, it'll be your nominal tax rate, e.g 25%.
You should calculate your best option based on your projections of any cryptocurrencies you own into next year.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:02:40
There are no thresholds. Anything and everything.
@_date: 2014-11-03 19:03:26
Your  is only if you are filing using 1040A. If you use the long-form 1040 capital losses are not part of your itemized deductions, so you can include your losses and take the standard deduction.
@_date: 2014-03-16 21:19:43
Given that not doing so is tax fraud, many people believe that it is a better to report.
If you got audited, and made any payments from your banks to a Bitcoin exchanges, they may well into that further.
Also, if you were a MtGox customer, that data is now publically available as well possibly being accessibly by the government due to their investigations into MtGox.
If you incurred gains but didn't report them, you would be subject to civil penalties. If you fail to report an exchange through FBAR, and the IRS decided it was necessary, there is a wilful fine of $100,000.
So, in the end, many people just prefer to not sweat it and worry about an audit, which could expose a lot more than they saved by not paying taxes.
@_date: 2014-04-04 19:22:39
I disagree. Many people have already used [bitcointaxes.info]( to calculate gains and taxes.
There is definitely a market for people who want to be tax compliant. As the usage of Bitcoin increases, the numbers of bitcoin tax-evaders and amount of tax fraud will decrease.

It's being added in [bitcointaxes]( in the release after next. (right now we testing support for Australia/UK/Canada tax years).
You can enter your addresses and we'll show all the outgoing transactions, which you can mark as purchases, and enter the amount and value. We the will include it in existing capital gains calculations.
@_date: 2014-10-11 07:32:58
No. Only if you've sold or spent any. There are no taxes for just owning or buying them, unless you mined them, in which case that is income.
@_date: 2014-03-28 23:23:19
With mining a BTC in Jan, you got paid for creating a coin. $1k income. It's price thereafter is a separate event, even though you could made a capital loss of $1k because it is then priced down to zero. And that can be offset against your income, giving you your net income of zero. However, you can only do that up to $3k per tax year.
edit: you can still deduct operating expenses. So if the coin was still worth $1k in Aug, and you had purchased $1k worth of mining equipment that year, you can deduct it (in a business) to get zero net income.
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:06:09
It's a self reporting system. The onus is on you to record and report. I think it'll change over time.
This treatment is really no different that the majority of other countries.
@_date: 2014-12-04 06:29:19
First, start taking records from now. Also collect anything you do have.
You may want to get professional tax advice, especially if you think the taxes you owed might be large.
You can try and estimate any mining you did, as that counts as income. However, there is some question on what a fair price would be for a coin that has no direct USD market. i.e is it nothing or should you have to convert it to BTC to get a value?
If you know your mining addresses from any pools you could use the input transactions as a ways to estimate income.
MtGox data can be recovered, if what you have is worth it. We provide a service to restore account data at [bitcointaxes.info]( As you say, other records might be gone.
Whilst the IRS puts the burden on you to maintain records, you would likely have to go through an audit before any of this would matter. At that time you would want to show you did the best you could and paid any taxes you owed.
edit: saw your other thread, where you seem to indicate that you have only earned Bitcoins and not spend/sold any. If this is the case, then you do not owe any capital gains taxes yet. For future information, selling or spending BTC would trigger a tax event and you include the transaction as part of your 1040 Schedule D.
You do say you earned BTC. This is reported and taxed as normal income. You report income being the fair value of the BTC in payment. So if you did a job for $200 but paid in BTC, you had $200 income. You can treat it as being paid in cash for tax purposes. However, you also use that $200 to set your cost basis for those BTC you earned, so when you come to sell them, you can work out any gains.
Feel free to ask or PM me if you have any other or specific questions.
@_date: 2014-10-09 19:56:32
Oops. Thanks.
@_date: 2014-03-25 20:16:59
If you mine a coin, you received income of its fair value that day. So if you mined 1 BTC today, you need to declare $585 income.
@_date: 2014-03-17 17:21:47
Right. But it's up to the user to add such a transaction.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:31:37
Original: 
This clarifies:
* Bitcoin/crypto-currencies are property, not a currency, and so capital gains applies.
* Spending coins is a tax event and must account for gains
* Being paid in coins for goods/services is income, and treated as USD of the fair market value on the date of receipt.
* Conversion calculations to USD must be reasonable and consistent.
* Mined coins are income on the date of receipt at fair market value (i.e. they are not stock)
This had been the treatment in [bitcointaxes]( so if you had used it you shouldn't need to change anything.
@_date: 2014-02-03 22:59:50
FIFO is the IRS default and preferred method, but you can choose specific identification as long as you are consistent.
@_date: 2014-03-11 02:35:51
Assuming US, not for 2013 taxes. You'll have to wait till when you file next year for 2014's taxes
It may well depend on what happens.
If you only get some, or none of you coins back, you will be able to file the those as lost at zero price. Bear in mind the only losses you have are the cost basis of those coins, which might not be their market value. If you bought 10 BTC in Feb 2013 at $10 each, your loss is only $100.
Write them off as a capital loss against any gains in 2014, and up to $3,000 losses against your income, and then carry forward the remaining for futures years.
@_date: 2014-03-26 01:33:18
If you are a business or self-employed, then yes, as part of your normal operating expenses, e.g. as part of Schedule C.
If you are doing it as a hobby, then only as part of your itemized deductions (up to the maximum hobby income you made), on Schedule A. You would then take the greater of that plus any other itemized deductions against the standard deduction.
@_date: 2014-05-27 17:16:07
Whilst there isn't an absolutely requirement to keep things separate, it is just about giving yourself extra evidence in case of an audit to be able to reasonably show that how long the coins are held. What you are thinking sounds reasonable.
Hot or cold wallet don't change anything for tax purposes, only your own security. What's important is that the addresses hold a balance that can clearly show the coins were added on a date more than a year ago, an there have been no withdrawals, which is why even though possible to use the same wallets it is just much more complicated to track.
I'm not sure I understand your comment about getting in and out of short term BTC having no gains. The cost basis will likely be different from when you buy and sell, even the same day. You can't really use an average daily price but rather the fair price in USD, i.e. how much it cost you and how much you made. If you do this daily, it's likely they cancel each other out, some days the price will go up and some days go down. However, you'd still need to track each buy and sell to be able to show your cost and gains. If you put $1,000 in on 1st Jan, buy and sell each day, and take out $2,000 on 31st Dec, that's a gain no matter how you break down each daily trade.
If you are going with paper wallets, just make sure you keep backups. Print off copies and put them elsewhere. Safety deposit box, family, friends. You can also use BIP38 that lets you password protect the keys if you are distributing them. 
- Keep a record of every trade (buy and sell) you make: date, amount, price.
- Download this from the exchanges often...as MtGox has showed us that could suddenly lose access to your account
- Keep a record of every purchase you make with coins: date, BTC amount, fair price in USD.
- Ideally separate your long-term coins from your spending coins, in a separate wallet/address, and you only withdraw them after a year when you intend to turn them back into cash
- Backup your keys and test your backups occasionally
@_date: 2014-05-26 20:06:04
Whether LIFO or FIFO is best for you depends on your circumstances and if the market is going up or down. It's possible you want to spend some coins in order to realize a loss on them in order to maximize your total loss for the year. 
But for most people, you don't want a continual turn over of coins. i.e. spending oldest first. Because then you'll never benefit from long-term tax rates.
It would be better to put some coins away for investment, and keep some coins for spending. When you buy new coins, you can allocate them as you wish.
Whilst you can track each coin and still report using LIFO or FIFO (see later) it will be a lot easier to prove your tax situation if you have two completely separate wallets.
Use one (cold wallet) for investment. You basically only every put coins in there, and only transfer them out to sell into USD after more than a year. Everything in that wallet will then be long-term gains. Also use a separate coinbase account for the buying/selling to ensure nothing is mixed.
The other wallet you can use for purchasing/spending/trading, and any gains are intended to be short term.
The reason for all this is that *if* you get audited, you can show the addresses and transactions in the long-term wallet and give documentation that they are, and only have only ever been, for investment purposes. It removes the fungibility argument.
Hopefully then the IRS wouldn't claim you mixed coins, and so would not stop you claiming long-term tax rates.
So lastly, there is nothing specific from the IRS that LIFO is allowed or not allowed. Some tax people are saying you can, some saying you can't, and some saying you should only use FIFO to be prudent as if the IRS later says definitely "no LIFO" you might have to pay owed taxes. The two wallets approach also means you don't have to worry about this.

When BillyBob spends his 150 BTC, he has to account for any gains he may have made.
So if he bought them at $1 and say he spends 150 BTC for a Tesla worth $75k, he made $499 gains per coin, or $74,850. That is capital gains and taxed accordingly. 
Given the price, he obviously owned them for more than a year, so they are taxed at long-term rates, which is probably 15% (or 20%) for Mr. B. So he has an extra $11,227 taxes this year. Still not a bad deal getting a Tesla for $11,377.
Tesla take on 150 BTC at $500, and depending on how they collect they may have no Bitcoin tax liability. If they use BitPay, for example, they could just get the USD equivalent. However, if they received the BTC directly they would be liable for capital gains once they are sold or exchanged.
All transactions should be included for capital gains, there is not limit, you still have to work it out. However, there is a practical limit where if the gains are less than $0.50 it will be rounded down to zero on your tax form. So in this instance they would not be reported.

Capital asset long-term gains would be taxed at 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your marginal rate. (Short-term would be income rates).

Given the state of Bitcoin and taxation at the moment I really believe if you are acting in good faith and can produce documentary evidence to back up your figures, you in as good situation as you can be.

There's no real alternative.

Nothing changes, unfortunately. You can't claim deductions or losses for negligence.

The IRS hasn't specified that you can or can't. With stocks you could elect to use specific identification, e.g. LIFO, before you sold the stock, but that doesn't exist in Bitcoin exchanges.
Opinions differ, but most are suggesting you only use FIFO, since that is the IRS preferred method. If in the future they say you cannot use LIFO, you would have to recalculate, amended your return and potentially pay more taxes. They'll never say you couldn't use FIFO.
Unless they actually come up with a statement, it isn't likely to be settled until the first appeals against audits go through. Could take a while. So if you do use it, be aware of the consequences.
@_date: 2014-03-25 18:45:03
They only don't tax long term gains. Nor does the US for lower band tax payers.

Yes, put your totals in Schedule D part 1 or 2, depending on how long you owned the coins (short term is a year or less). You'll likely need to tick C or F, because you have no 1099-B.
Then fill in Form 8949 for every Sell you made, and show the date you bought the coin, for how much, when you sold it, how much, and the gain or loss you made.

It is for the moment...until the IRS catches on that this is happening and amend their wash sales definition!
Now or wait till end of year, I know, it's a gamble either way. Although the sooner you do it the sooner you will be back into having owned them for a year, and so better rate if they go back up.

I don't see paying taxes will doom Bitcoin, but being able to calculate them in that it will make people less inclined (or able to work out how much) to pay those taxes.
Whilst right now Bitcoin may well be a trade unit, it is really becoming more than that. It is being used like an asset today, but over time will be used more like a currency.
It's the tax laws themselves that are the biggest hindrance. It is going to be impractical to imagine that everyone who spends a Bitcoin keeps a ledger of all their transaction in order to work out the potential gains. It might is possible today, but not if the popularity and usage continues.

I'm kind of biased, but last time I checked kryptotax does not account for fees, so you will be have more gains and pay more taxes. It also won't import any non-USD files, from MtGox for example, and doesn't show your cost basis for next year, meaning you'll have to declare a short-term, zero-based cost and pay more taxes.
[BitcoinTaxes]( supports:
* multiple currencies (USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD)
* alt-coins
* coin-coin trading (through fiat, BTC or LTC)
* FIFO, average costing and specific identification
* imports from more exchanges (MtGox, Bitstamp, BTC-e, Coinbase, Cryptsy, Bitfinex, Localbitcoins, Bitfloor, CSV)
* exports data as CSV or ready for Schedule D 8949 form, TurboTax and TaxAct.
* previous tax years (2010-2013) and carries forward any cost basis
* final closing positions including cost basis for next year
The next release (due Soon^TM ) will support other country's tax years and tax bands (for estimates), UK, Canada and Australia.

I believe that is referring to 1099 reporting, not gains:
See the PDF:

@_date: 2014-03-28 22:45:51
They are treating it as a service rather than production. It's as if you performed a hashing service for which you were paid a fee, and so it is seen as immediate income.
It's another variant of the general issue where cryptos are both assets and currency. It's new and unique, but the IRS are trying to fit them into existing boxes rather than create new ones. In this case the coin is just a side-effect of your service, whereas you actually manufactured it.
@_date: 2014-07-02 23:24:06
Assuming you are in the US:
No they are not stock options.
If you get paid in Bitcoins, generally, you owe income taxes on the amount that it would have been in USD. The business owes socsec/ins taxes as if it had paid you in USD. All that is different is how you actually received the remuneration.
The actual amount of taxes you owe is no different than being paid in USD.
There would be no sales taxes.
You have not realized any gains yet, so there is no capital gains taxes.
Finally, you have received BTC for an amount and that sets the cost basis. So if you sold them in the future, you would use that to calculate any capital gains/losses.
For example, say you noramlly earn $1000, but instead received 1.54 BTC. You have income of $1000 and that figure will be added to your income for tax purposes. You'll pay your normal tax rate on it, for example, 25% or $250.
You also now own 1.54 BTC with a cost basis of $649.35. So if in a few weeks you sell them all for $1500. You have made $500 short-term capital gains, which will also be taxed as income, e.g. 25% or $125.
If you wait for more than a year, it would instead be long-term gains and taxed at more favorable rates.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:24:33
You're right. It's a currency that's being taxed as an asset. This is the big issue with usage in the US right now. It's actually a bit of both, but the IRS can't handle a new paradigm of money that is used both as investment and currency. We are stuck in this middle ground whilst it is still evolving.
In practical terms, you don't have to continually track price fluctuations, but what you do need to track is your cost basis when you receive BTC and your proceeds when you sell/spend BTC. Fortunately, using Coinbase does this for you. They already record and you can export all your cost basis. Also if you use your Coinbase account to purchase something, it is also recorded in your account. That is enough to be able to calculate taxes (if any), so you really don't have to do anything.
However, if you transfer those coins to a different wallet to spend, or trade on a different exchange, or bought alt-coins, you need to manage the transferred cost basis. This is where it is cumbersome and complicated.

As they are assets, you can really do either. Unlike stocks, where you have to inform your broker before the sale, but there is no such rule or capability with bitcoin. However the IRS prefers FIFO and you should be consistent and not pick and choose to your advantage, which the IRS might reject if you got audited.

All account trading histories were leaked data, from 2011 up to 30th Nov 2013. You can use it to extract your trade history.
Otherwise you can estimate any trading you might have done, or in simple cases use what you sent out from your bank account and what you received back. The problem is then just being able to work out cost basis of those coins for capital gains purposes.
You can use [bitcointaxes.info]( to do this, and we also provide a recovery service for the MtGox data.
In the end, in the UK, if you aren't close to the ~£10k limit you don't really have to worry. But if you are, like in the US, you need to be able to provide evidence or best estimates in case of an audit.
@_date: 2014-07-10 17:52:39
In theory, yes, because you might have a reportable gain or loss, which you won't know unless you track it.
Easy example. Say you bought 5 BTC @ $620, then you quickly turn around and buy a listed $3200 car with those 5 BTC. The fair value of your BTC at that time was $640 each, so you made $20 per coin, or $100 profit. You basically got a $3200 car for only $3100. That extra $100 is gains and taxed as short term capital gains. You would report it on your Schedule D.
Now, let's say you bought 0.008 BTC for $5. Then went and bought a coffee for $5.40 with those 0.008 BTC. You made $0.40 profit, which in theory should still be reported. However, on the US tax forms, each transaction gets rounded to the nearest dollar, so your gain is reported as $0, and in fact not even included.
So the first problem is you don't know this unless you track it, unless you are absolutely certain the purchase price and volume matches the sale price and volume.
The next issue is you might not spend all the coins you bought, and the remainder must be tracked.
So say with that 0.008 BTC from above you only spent half, 0.004, on your coffee. A year from now you spend the other half, but the BTC price has gone up to $1500. Your remaining 0.004 is now worth $6, not the original $2.50. If you spend it, you would have made gains of $3.50, which is capital gains income and taxable.
The burden is on you to do record-keeping, and you should do it so you can always prove your position in case you are audited.
@_date: 2014-11-03 18:55:25
As has been said, there is no clear answer as the IRS has not given explicit guidance on this issue. Some tax professions will say to only use FIFO to be safe (ensuring you don't underpay owed taxes). But bitcoin is property, not stocks, so rules like lot-selection for selling and wash sales just aren't relevant.
The issue is really to do with their fungability and being able to track which coin you are selling and for what price. If you had all your coins in one wallet, but with differing cost basis, how do you know which one you are selling? It's an interesting problem, since most wallets don't let you pick the previous transaction inputs to spend.
One solution is to keep different wallets for different cost basis. That way you can clearly show that you are spending coins of a certain cost. But that isn't always practical, especially if you are buying/selling within an exchange account.
So that's the thing, if you were audited, you need to be able to show your workings and that you are tracking all the cost basis where you use a method other than FIFO.
It was one of the reasons for creating [ to be able to track this. So we keep a track of all the cost basis for every received and disposed coin, so you can show and calculate the gains correctly.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:04:31
Some are for sure, due to the losses over 2014 and the ability for US tax payers to declare losses on capital property and allowing immediate buyback (i.e. wash sales are not applicable). This isn't allowed for 30 days in some other countries, due to their tax laws applying to all capital gains.
As to if it's significant enough to be driving the price down, not sure. If it picks up from 1st, then perhaps so.
@_date: 2014-10-10 17:41:16
1. The IRS considers it property, so it is taxed like any other capital asset, and is subject to capital gains taxes.
2. When you buy Bitcoins, keep track of what you bought, when and for how much. You'll need this when you sell/spend.
3. If all you have done is bought some Bitcoins, you don't need to do anything. You don't have to declare them, you don't owe any taxes.
4. When you sell Bitcoins, you need to work out any potential gains/losses you made. This is the USD you got from selling, less the cost of those coins (from 2) and also less any fees you paid.
5. Any sales generate a potential tax liability in the year that you do the sell. So if you sold today, you will have to include it on your tax forms for 2014 that you file in April 2015.
6. It's always a good idea to estimate the taxes you owe when selling and put that portion aside, so you have it come April.
7. For tax purposes, spending is no different than selling. The USD you make when spend is the fair value of the thing you are buying. So you need to keep a track of any spending, i.e. date, the USD value, amount of coins.
8. You include all your gains/losses, from spending or selling, in Schedule D of your 1040.
9. Gains are split into long-term and short-term. Long-term is when you owned the coin (or part) that you spent for more than a year.
10. The amount of tax depends on your circumstances and other income. Long-term gains are taxed at either 0%, 15% or 20%. So, for example, if you are single and earned less than $36,900 elsewhere, you'll pay 0%. Short-term gains are taxed like normal income, so whatever your rate is from all your combined income.

Since you're 14, your parents will include any income you make on their tax returns.
1. Tell them about any coins you mined. That is taxable income at the price on the day they were mined.
2. If you have sold any coins. Tell them the date you sold, number of coins, how much you received as well as how much you bought those coins for and when. This is capital gains income.
3. If you spent any coins, you should also do the above. The "how much you received" is the cost of what you bought.
If you didn't mine, sell or spend, you don't need to do or tell anyone anything. You do need to keep the records of buying coins, i.e. how many, when, the price, for when you do sell or spend them later.

Unless they say otherwise, then the [advice]( I have seen is that it isn't, since the IRS specifically state that wash sales only applies to [stocks and securities](

The IRS ruling hasn't really changed anything. You pay capital gains taxes on any profit you make when disposing of a coin, whether by selling it or spending it.
Unfortunately the IRS sees the burden on you to track your taxable income, and if, if, you were audited they would have to show how you work it out.
If you typically spend coin that you have held since prices were low, and potentially made a profit of more than $0.50, then you are supposed to declare it in 1040 Schedule D. If you spending is always close (in time or price) to your bitcoin purchase, and so the prices close enough that any gains would be less than $0.50, then it wouldn't get included on your tax forms anyway.
Of course, often you don't know that until you have worked it out, so using something like [ can help you add your purchases and spending and see what tax you might owe.

(1) They are a means to an end in working out how much taxes you owe. Underpaying or not filing is why you get penalized. But you ought to report them, just to reduce taxes you do owe.
(2) This could be a casualty loss, not a capital gains loss, but there are some conditions that have to be met. See 
(3) If he only put in USD, and only withdrew USD, then that is your gain. You would just have to record it as such with one line item being the date and amount going in, date and amount coming out. Difference is the gain.
However, if he still owns Bitcoins/alt-coins from trading there (by withdrawing them), he probably won't be able to prove the cost basis going forward, so under an audit they could be assumed as having zero-cost for when they are sold in the future.

If you're thinking about mined coins, it's something I'm working on, but getting the data in is going to be messy because there is no common standard. Best I could think of is adding your "mining addresses" which we would watch and add automatically.

If you are making payments in Bitcoin, you would only potentially be paying capital gains taxes. You would have to calculate any gains, or losses, you made from the day you spent the coins by using the fair value of your payment in USD, less the price your paid for those coins. That gets recorded in your 1040 Schedule D.
If you are trying to deduct mortgage loan payments, you would receive a 1098 form from the lender them that would include all your loan payment details for the year. But I assume this isn't a loan you could deduct since "I don't know the identity of the lender".

Not if you treated it as stock as the accountant above suggests. It would be taxed as normal income to your business whenever you disposed of them.

I mention the separate wallets as it is a good way for beginners to set up their accounts in order to split up investment and spending coins. However, it doesn't actually do anything other than provide you with evidence if you happen to get audited. Otherwise there is a risk the IRS might not accept the proof that the long-term capital gains rates you are claiming are valid.
You can still do it the current way, by tracking every trade/purchase. It's how my website does it. We just haven't yet had a test case with someone vs. the IRS to accept or reject it.
No, the clock doesn't start again by just moving coins around. But you must keep track of them. This means that whenever you buy a coin, you need to record the quantity, date and cost. You do this because when you sell you will use that information to calculate your gains, and therefore tax liability.
If you don't have this, the IRS will assume everything is short-term.
This is about being able to claim long-term capital gains rates.
Now, it's nice and easy if you buy and sell in round numbers. Bought 1 BTC for $500 on this date, spent 1 BTC for $600 on that date. The problem is in reality it is, spent 0.026 BTC for $15.60, leaving me 0.974 BTC with a cost basis of $500. Buy another 0.5 BTC @ $550. So now I have 1.474 BTC but logically split into two cost basis. It starts to get really complicated, IF you want to be able to isolate those coins you have owned for more than a year to get the better tax rates.
So don't worry about transfer coins around. It makes no difference for tax purposes. Only buying/selling/trading where you are converting into USD or using like USD.
Keep a record of every coin you buy, sell or trade with the date, quantity and value in USD. This is the only way you are going to know, and show, that the coins you are selling in retirement are these ones that you bought back then for this price.
Did I answer your question?...please follow up if not.
@_date: 2014-04-11 18:57:07
There is no specific guidance from the IRS, and opinions seem to differ.
The default is First-In-First-Out, but if these were stocks, you could also elect to use Last-In-First-Out or even choose specifically which share to sell. With stocks you have to inform your broker before you sell. This obviously doesn't exist with bitcoin.
Most advice is to be prudent and use FIFO, because it is the IRS's default method and if they explicitly said you couldn't use the others in the future, then you don't have to worry. But if you did use something like LIFO, you would have to calculate and possibly owe taxes.
So to answer your question, you sell 0.1 BTC for $200, and you choose the first 0.1 BTC you even owned as the cost basis. If you had bought more, you need to split them, e.g. 1 BTC = 0.1 BTC + 0.9 BTC. If you had bought less, you need to split the Sell to match the costs.

It will probably come, but the IRS needs to reclassify it away from personal property, although it is unique in being both property and currency.

You can gift up to $14k tax free, so there is no income tax. 
There are no other taxes due until the coin is either sold or spent. 
Please keep a record of the date you bought it and how much you paid, which is the coin's cost basis, because if it is sold/spent you can deduct that to reduce any potential gains.

If you have coins that are worth a lot less near the end of the year, you can sell them and buy them back immediately (if you wish). The loss you generate can be included on your 2014 tax forms. This will potentially reduce your tax bill.
Whilst the losses can be used to offset any other capital gains you made this year (stocks, for example), you can only offset up to $3k of your income. The remaining losses will have to be carried forward into future tax years.
You will reset the cost basis of those coins to a lower value as well as the date. This means if they do go up within the following 12 months, you could be paying short-term capital gains rates instead of the more preferential long-term rate if you spend or sell them.

For a company, this is typically everything (also unrelated to mining), but the self-employed might have to work out the specific cost of electricity for the mining machines, from their hours usage, power consumption, and rates. Maybe this would be better done by logging on the miners to tally the hours on.

You would pay taxes as if you had paid them in USD. They will pay income taxes as if they had been paid in USD. 
How much depends on how much you are paying your employees. If you are paying a USD salary, but just using BTC as a payment then nothing changes.
If you are paying a fixed amount of BTC (or even if it varies) you will have to convert to the fair price of their services, which is what you would pay someone in USD.
They are a number of services popping up that will do all this for you. e.g. Bitpay has a payroll part.

You only pay taxes on the profits, which is no different than any other investment. You don't get free money because it's Bitcoin.
If you are investing, then make sure you don't spend or trade you coins for at least a year. You'll then be eligible for the long-term capital gains rate if you sell at a profit.
If you sell at a loss, you can also offset that against any other gains or limited amount of your income.

Mined coins (from today) are income from their fair value of the date. You can use any established exchange rate, as long as you are consistent. So, for example, say you mined 1 BTC on 1st Jan 2013, that would be $13.33 (from MtGox). Then you also own that coin with a cost basis of $13.33. So if you sold in in April for $100, you have short term gains of $86.67
So, right now on your tax form you would declare the $13.33 as part of your income. How you add it depends on if you doing it as a hobby or as "self-employed" i.e. on the 1040 or in a Schedule C.
The coins you spent, the gains are calculated using the different of what you were worth (say you bought a $100 gift card) and their cost basis, so you would add $86.67 as part of capital gains in Schedule D.
@_date: 2014-03-29 16:23:28
You can use the price from any established source, as long it is reasonable and used consistently. For example, you can use the exchange's price where you typically sell the coins, a well-know exchange, Bitstamp, or even an aggregation like bitcoinaverage.com.

You are confusing methods used to calculating capital gains and being able to choose a specific coin to spend.
Wallets don't get to choose the identification methods for capital gains as they are irrelevant. A wallet doesn't know how long I've owned a coin, as I might have transferred it from another.
What a wallet should provide is for to be able to pick which coins you want to spend. That way I can select ones with my desired cost basis an age and allow you to separate long term and short term coins. However, even so, the IRS might not accept it as you can't chop and change your method for your own advantage.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:02:02

It's no different really. Long-term is just because you held the coins for more than a year and you get a better tax rate. Right now most people seems to be advising to treat it as an capital asset, in which case as long as you keep a record of all your Buys and Sells, you can establish how long you have owned the coins and therefore if they are long or short term.
Of course, the real issue is that you can't select the actual coin to sell, but by default you would use the FIFO rule. The other complication is you don't Buy and Sell in equal amounts, and trades are often split into trades of different volumes and price. 
I had this issue, with trades across different exchanges and was trying to work it all out, and ended up writing software to do it. Also since the price was increasing, using LIFO or HCFO would probably give a better outcome this year, deferring some taxes until they became long-term.

There is no ruling (this is the problem).
Some CPAs are indeed treating it as a currency, taking a more conservative approach - because you'll pay more taxes, and some are treating it as an asset - so capital gains, potentially less taxes.
As the IRS hasn't said anything yet it is really between you and your accountant on how you file. Neither are wrong. Many people are going the asset route because it is a reasonable assumption.

You only pay taxes on profits you make. What you transfer into your bank account is irrelevant - but it may be flagged for potential laundering activity, which is a different issue.
You need to keep a record of the cost basis of the Bitcoins you buy and then the proceeds from when you sell. The difference becomes your gain (or loss) and is taxable as capital gains on your 1040 Schedule D. Depending on the coins' age (over a year) it could be long term and short term. Short term is essentially normal income. Long term has a tax rate discount.
Be aware that gambling gains are income. And gambling losses can only be deducted against gambling gains.

* Bitcoin/crypto-currencies are property, not a currency, and so capital gains applies.
* Spending coins is a tax event and must account for gains
* Being paid in coins for goods/services is income, and treated as USD of the fair market value on the date of receipt.
* Conversion calculations to USD must be reasonable and consistent.
* Mined coins are income on the date of receipt at fair market value (i.e. they are not stock)
This had been the treatment in [bitcointaxes]( so if you had used it you shouldn't need to change anything.

It can be done with trades already, see [
We're currently integrating with Coinbase's API and the blockchain, so we can also track wallet activity, and keep gains calculated in real-time. The software solutions are only going to get better. I don't believe it's a big issue.
The issue is going to be the IRS trying to audit 10,000 lines on your 8949 forms.

The comment you were referring was talking about donations of property to qualified charities. 
First, you can only get a deduction up to 50% for cash, and 30% for capital gain property, against your AGI.
However, like stocks, you can donate property to charity without having to realize the gains first, and so you don't have a tax bill.
Say you bought 1 BTC at $100, and then later it was worth $575,and you wanted to donate $575 to charity.
If you sold your BTC first, you would first be liable for tax on the $475 gains (say 25%). You would then donate that $575, which would give you a charitable deduction. So it costs your initial investment ($100) plus gains tax ($118.75) less your donation deduction ($143.75) = $75.
Whereas, if you just donated the 1 BTC, you have no tax to pay, you get the full deduction on the amount, and the charity gets the full amount. So it costs you your investment ($100) less deduction ($143.75) = $-43.75
This only is useful if you were planning to donate to charity. In that case, use appreciated stock or property instead of cash, because you can get a better tax deduction.
You can't use on yourself, it has to be paid to a registered charity. You aren't making money, because you are giving it away, but you are paying less tax than if you turned it into cash first.

When they rebrand and relaunch, they may well give people access to their old account histories. This would be good.
If not, if you had at least downloaded your history in the last few months you could show the trades, you can therefore calculate some of the cost basis.
If you don't have that, an IRS audit could well decide that your cost basis is zero, in which case you loss is zero too.
@_date: 2014-03-03 17:23:58
Whilst you could argue that wash sales ought to be apply, right now they likely don't, as wash sales only apply to [stocks and securities]( Also see tax attorney dblcross121's [opinion](

Please can you send a support ticket, and I'll have a look for you.
If you haven't loaded up all your cost basis for all your accounts, i.e. gox, then it will have to assume a zero-cost basis if you sell those coins but can't show how you bought them. This is likely the discrepancy, because every sell is essentially 100% gains. You will need that MtGox data.
edit: partial histories for MtGox can be pulled from the leaked data, but due to bugs in their own reporting, it might not be complete. Otherwise, the general advice is to file for an extension and hope they allow access to your history before October (be aware you still need to pay any due taxes at the normal time).
@_date: 2014-03-27 21:51:47

You can only deduct gambling losses against gambling winnings, otherwise you can't use them for anything.
However depending on which tax year and what price you originally bought your DOGE, and if you actually declared and paid taxes on any profits in 2013, you might be able to report losses from selling your DOGE back to BTC in 2014.

If you sell a product or service as a business for crypto, you should treat it as a barter transaction. This essentially means an exchange of goods and services.
The 1 BTC you receive is treated as income. But the amount of income is the fair price of the 1 BTC, e.g. the price of 1 BTC that day. So if you sold a widget, and someone pays you 1 BTC, you have received (say) $600 income. It's up to you if you convert it into $ or not, but for accounting purposes, that is your income.
The widget you sold becomes a business expense, and therefore reduces your tax liability.
With regard to that 1 BTC you now own. It's costs basis was $600 less any transaction fees. If you sell it and it increases in value, you are also liable for capital gains.
If you barter with other businesses, you may be required to issue them a 1099-MISC form.
@_date: 2014-03-15 21:04:29
With only a month left to file US taxes, if you are still having trouble calculating capital gains, there is a website [bitcointaxes]( that imports the trade history from common exchanges and works it out for you.
@_date: 2014-05-27 06:42:23
Correct. Your gambling losses are irrelevant. But if you made investment losses you can deduct them against any other gains you might make this year or up to $3k of your income for 2014.
@_date: 2014-10-01 08:24:27
You have received a gift, and under the $14k limit there are no taxes owed by you.
However, once you have received the coins you need to record the cost basis for when you sell or spend them.
If they previously owned the coins, and gave them to you, you should ask how much they bought them for and when. You can use this as the cost basis going forward. Be aware they are transferring that profit to you and you might owe more taxes when you sell them than you thought. If they made a loss, they probably ought to have sold them first and bought back.
But if they just purchased some coins and sent them over, then that is the cost basis, or you can just use the daily price when you received them.
In any case, for now you don't have to do anything, don't have to report anything, and don't owe any taxes.
But when you sell or spend those coins, you need to work out the gain (or loss). This is the difference between what you sold them for and the cost basis from above (less fees). This is capital gains and reported on your tax forms (Schedule D).
No, Circle doesn't support non-US banks yet.
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:56:01
The reason is not only cost, but also that in an audit if you can't prove when you received the coin, it could be reverted to short-term gains, and taxed at marginal rates.
Perhaps the IRS will have evolved to accepting the blockchain and cryptographical proof of ownership by then, but you never know. No harm in being prudent.
@_date: 2014-02-04 16:51:34
There is no definite answer to that, because it hasn't been classified as one thing or another. Right now, as a general capital asset, I can't see why you couldn't treat it that way.
This is the comment from the Tax Attorney who [posted]( on reddit:

Don't see that. Reasonable from a tax perspective.
@_date: 2014-03-25 19:24:50
Bob is right. Although they don't explicitly say, as all coins are property, you are buying property with property and so gains are realized.
@_date: 2014-12-22 18:22:10
You have to report all sales of capital property on your 1040 Schedule D.
This includes any purchases you have made using bitcoin. There is no threshold, other than the calculated gains and losses are rounded to the nearest dollar, so anything less than 0.50 will be ignored.
Your gain or loss is the proceeds from selling or the fair price when spending, and so you must also track the cost basis of any coins you own. This is the only way you know if you had made a loss, and without it the IRS could assume you made a profit.
Whilst if this is a loss, you'll owe no taxes, you will be able to reduce your tax burden this year by declaring losses. 
If you were audited then this could potentially be checked. The risk of an audit depends on your circumstances, but is low for most people.

Well, only their opinion matters during an audit, so as long as it is reasonable and consistent.
If it were currency, you could use "any posted rate that is consistently used".[[1]]( 
Personally, I'm considering MtGox not reasonable or consistent for 2014, but probably was for 2013. But then so would be the Bitstamp or BTC-e rate.
@_date: 2014-02-27 19:06:32
Actually they are. The numbers of users on [bitcointaxes.info]( and feedback shows they are willing to pay their share of taxes.
Despite no exchanges directly reporting to the IRS, the risk of an audit, FBAR fines and worry of tax evasion seem to be enough for many people not to take the risk.
@_date: 2014-09-15 17:59:05
Wallets don't have all the information to calculate tax because they don't know the cost basis.
When you buy a coin on Bitstamp, Coinbase, or wherever, and transfer it into your wallet, the cost basis is lost. You no longer know when or for how much that coin cost you. Likewise, when you spend it you also don't know the fair price of the item you are buying, if it all, in case you just transferred it.
Now, Coinbase could do this IF you used them solely for all your buying/selling of coins and spending. But many people transfer the coins to their own wallets, spend in other ways, or transfer coin to other exchanges. Doing that would make Coinbase's figures wrong.
Right now (in the US - like it or hate it) all spending must be tracked in order to calculate potential gains on any transactions. The only way to do this is to know that the coin you are spending cost you $X, you received it on Y, and you are spending it for $Z. (Whilst you could substitute market rates, it might give you a increased tax burden.)
edit: the next/Beta version of [bitcointaxes.info]( has a Spending tab that allows you to add transactions from Coinbase, Core Wallet, an address or a CSV. They will then get included in capital gains calculations.
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:36:33
It depends on your circumstances.
Yes, you can create a loss, and you can use that loss to reduce any other gains you have made and up to $3,000 on your income. Anything beyond that is carried over into the following year.
However, you will also reset the cost basis of your coins to this date, so if you want to sell them at a gain in the future AND get the discounted long-term tax rate, you will need to wait a whole year.
You can use BitcoinTaxes to enter your trades and costs basis, then add some manual trades to do "what-if" you made some sales between now and the end of the year.
@_date: 2015-05-08 01:24:29
Yes, gains made from trading Bitcoins (and any cryptocurrency) are subject to capital gains taxes in the US. This includes spending them as well as trading. [See IRS Notice](
The "capital gain" is the difference between the money you make in selling (or value when spending) and how much you bought those coins for originally. Be aware that could also be a loss if negative.
Capital gains is income but has different tax rules, depending on how long the Bitcoin had been held. Essentially, if they were owned for more than a year (called long-term gains) then the tax rate is a lot less, either 0%, 15% or 20%. If you were in the lower two tax brackets you would pay 0% taxes on these long-term gains. Short term gains are just added and taxed with other income.
You can read more information on our [tax blog](
However, as a minor, it depends on the value of gains as to if you would file your own return, include it on your parents or even not need to declare anything. Assuming you are still supported by your parents, you should speak to them with your information so they (or with their accountant) can work out how to file. Lastly, profits are declared in the year they are made. So if you sold coins today and made a profit, it will be included in the 2015 tax return filed by April 2016.

Good info about taking losses.
However he mentions the wash sale rule, and saying "30 days", which is not applicable to Bitcoin. You can still takes losses up till 31st Dec.
@_date: 2014-05-27 21:28:19
a) This is adapted from currency exchange where you have to report income you earned from foreign currency. Here it refers to when you buy something for which you have no fair or equivalent USD price, you should use the fair market value. How you determine the market value is up to you, but you can choose as long as it is a consistent and reliable source.
b) Daily price is used in currency exchange. For Bitcoin you can choose your source as long as it is sound. You would just have to justify your source in an audit. But you probably wouldn't get away with consistently buying on one exchange yet using another's for the exchange rate.
Your credit card example is not the same as trading. It's more akin to calculating mining income where you can only rely on a daily price. But for trading you have an explicit price. If you go onto Coinbase and buy 1 BTC, you know the cost basis exactly. If you sold it a day later, you know the proceeds exactly. The difference is your gain or loss. I suggest you get your CPA's opinion on this, but unless somehow you couldn't track each trade, not using your actual costs as a way to avoid taxes probably wouldn't sit with the IRS (if it works out you owe any...it could work out you make a loss).
If you spend coins, in theory, you have to keep a track of the fair value of the item you receive less the cost basis of the portion of the coin you spent, less any fees. Sure, if it comes out less than $.50 then it won't actually make it onto your tax form because of rounding, but you don't know that unless you track it.
This is the whole big issue with Bitcoin and the IRS, and the reason people aren't happy with it being treated as property, as in usage it acts like a currency. The record-keeping requirements could be ludicrous. But until the IRS says otherwise, right now it's what you have to do.
As I said, in the end it'll probably all even itself out and I imagine using a daily rate would be pretty close to actual values. However, you can see there are variable that could alter this. Say you also bought in the morning, but spend later in the day, and the price always went up. You potentially could be making profits that aren't being declared.
A final thought is that one other specific identification methods might suit better than LIFO, where you are trying to identify those coins that have the closest cost to the ones you are spending, so that the net gain/loss is at small as possible (or as close to $0.50 as possible) to minimize your tax liability.
In the end you'll file your taxes, reporting income and all this only matters if you get audited. And if you do, you will need to show you were working in good faith. If you have a convincing argument, and don't appear to owe taxes by doing things differently, then you'll likely be fine. But it'll be different if they think you are doing this to avoid taxes.

As dkmdlb says, file for an extension.
This is probably all you can do, and hope that the account histories get released.
The problem is that as far as the IRS are concerned it is your responsibility to keep records. You can't blame a 3rd party. Worst case if you can never get these, and you are audited and owe taxes, you could face civil penalties for negligence or fraud.
The reddit friendly tax attorney recently [cautioned that the US may well gain access to MtGox records]( and so not including any gains could become fraud.
If it does get to that time where you have no records and your extensions is running out, you probably would need to seek tax and legal advice.
@_date: 2014-05-27 04:55:26
Ok, well, you might need to check your original cost basis on your 50 BTC vs what it was when you got back to 50.2 BTC. Given the price is generally lower than in Feb, I'm guessing you made a loss. You should still work it out in case you can claim a loss for 2014....but you don't want to find out you'd made a profit.

In the US, all gains related to Bitcoin are reportable as capital gains. Whenever you dispose of a coin, by selling or spending, you would need to include the transaction on your 1040 Schedule D.
To do this you would need to know the cost basis of the coin you are spending. i.e. how much did you buy it for.
However, if the gains are less than $0.50, then due to nearest dollar rounding they wouldn't get onto your tax form. But you don't know this till you work it out.

You should have reported all income from your mined coins in 2013. If you mined in 2012 or earlier, you should have re-filed your tax returns.
The income is the price on the day you mined them. This would be hobby or self-employed income, depending on your circumstances. This would be taxed as regular income and so taxed at your normal tax rate.
You might want to consider going through a 3rd party, such as a tax attorney rather than meeting them yourself, especially if you are nervous about an audit.

When someone buys something from you, that's income.
When you buy products so you can sell them, that's an expense.
At the end of the year you total all your income, less all your expenses. That's your profit.
Profit is taxable. The rate depends on how much it was and how your are filing (a sole proprietor, LLC or corporation).
It doesn't matter how the customer pays as you always have to report income in your native currency, e.g. US Dollars. So if they buy a $20 widget from you and pay in Bitcoin, you had $20 income.
If you decide to keep the Bitcoins (instead of immediately exchanging into US dollars) you must also track how much those Bitcoins are worth. When you come to sell or spend them, you have to calculate any profit you made. That profit is capital gains income, which is taxable. The rate depends on how long you owned the Bitcoins and how much other income you have.
e.g. You have a widget that costs you $15 that you are selling for $20.
Your customer pays 0.02 Bitcoin.
Your have $20 income.
You have ($20-$15) $5 net income (profit).
Later you sell that 0.02 Bitcoin for $22.
You have $2 capital gains income.
You'll owe federal taxes on (5+2) $7, let's say your rate was 28%, so about $2.
Your local state or country may also have a sales tax or value-added tax (VAT). You are collecting taxes from the consumer on behalf of the government. You have to add the amount onto your sales price and then give that extra amount to the government.
At the end of the year you add up all the sales tax and pay it to the government. Some countries will also let you deduct any sales tax you paid. So if you paid sales tax when you bought the widget you only pay the difference. 
e.g. say your sales tax on a widget was 20%. You bought the widget for £18 (£15 + VAT). You sell the widget for £24 (£20 + VAT). Your net income is (20-15) £5. Your net tax is (4-3) £1 that you pay to the government.
@_date: 2017-02-04 21:38:54
You declare the sells as capital gains transactions.
In the US, this is done on your 1040. Any profit you made is capital gains income, which is taxed at rates from 0% to the same level as your income. This depends on if you owned the coins for more than a year, and what other income you have.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:34:11

No, none of the online tax filing software sites are really that crypto friendly. However, for small number of trades you only have to enter the information: the date you sold/disposed, the proceed amount in USD, the date you acquired the coins and for what USD value.
Personally, I use TaxACT because it is a little quicker to enter information and a lot cheaper.
You only need to report selling or spending, which isn't too difficult if there are only a few. However, it quickly becomes more complicated when you are spending part-coins or coins with different cost basis. e.g you bought 1 BTC @ $200, 1 BTC @ $200 and 1 BTC $500 and spending 2.5 BTC.
For that, I developed  that works out the appropriate entries for all your trading and creates an export file for TurboTax, TaxACT, Schedule D 8949 PDF or 8949 attachable statement.

I don't think anyone is saying you have to use FIFO, it's just that it is the standard IRS method and what they'd use if they calculated your taxes. And if they did clarify some time in the future (don't hold your breathe) and say "you must use FIFO", but you didn't, you could potentially owe taxes and therefore penalties.
Unless the IRS are being proactive on this, which I doubt, then it's only likely to come up again after someone is audited and they use the fact they didn't have to use FIFO in their defense. After the audit, appeals and finally we might get some definitive answer. But years away.
Till then, get advice if you need clarification and most importantly, keep records.

You have taxable gambling income of the market value in USD.


You could have filed a casualty loss (only in that year) for the cost basis value, however, this is an itemized deduction and has a 10% AGI rule. It would need to be a lot before it was useful.


You were gifted this and owe no taxes. They might depending on the value. The cost basis of these coins is their market value on that day.

Since it sounds like you are in the US:
1. You'll pay income tax on the mined coins, based on their daily market value. You'll also pay taxes on any gains made from selling them, the proceeds less the original value from mining. If this is less, you can claim a capital loss.
2. There are no taxes until you make gains, so if you hadn't sold/spent/traded, you owe no taxes.
3. No taxes unless you sell/spent/trade.
4. IRS hasn't clarified one way or another, but likely not.
5. Digital currencies themselves are not taxed, but gains made from income, trading or spending.

There's no debate as to if it's taxable, any income is taxable.
But trading income is only any gains you make when trading or disposing coins. If you bought 1 BTC for $800 and sold it for $1,000, then you have $200 capital gains income. However, the rate of tax depends on other circumstances, and could be from 0% to your standard tax rate.
Income in Bitcoin is taxable just like dollars. If you get paid, or earn, 5 BTC then you have income of either the equivalent fair value in USD or 5 x *daily price in USD* amount of income.

You will pay the same amount of taxes.

Dividends are additional income, which is taxable. You aren't paying taxes again on the original investment.

However, if you are referring to news in 2014, then you will have to file this next year, but even then my understanding is they are just a low price. You haven't make a loss until you actually sell them or they are officially worthless and no longer traded.

You import it from your own sources and so are in control of what information is stored. Essentially we are holding a combined copy of all your trading, spending, income activity to calculate income and gains reports.
But that might mean uploading an exported CSV from Bitstamp or the Core wallet, or authorizing your Coinbase account for our read-only access through their API.
Does that answer your question?
@_date: 2014-02-03 20:38:32
I don't see why it wouldn't work like any other capital losses within the year, up to the maximum of $3,000 losses per year and the remainder carried forward.
@_date: 2017-02-25 19:05:29
Another option is to call their API instead, if you can code. 
Or you could import it into Bitcon.Tax, then export it from there once done.
We use their API to pull down trading data. However, that isn't without issue since their servers are ridiculously throttled to allow you to get 50 trades every 6 seconds.

You're disposing of coins for property of value. It's a tax event. You need to calculate for any gains.
@_date: 2017-02-07 00:56:03
Yes, there is a long-term reduction in capital gains tax rates. If you were a single-filer you can have up to the $37k income before you would go up to the next band (which is only 15%).
Few things. It depends on what other income you have. You say zero now, but we're only in Feb.
Are your parents including you as a dependent on their tax forms? If so, you need to discuss it with them and talk to an accountant to decide the best way (essentially they can't if you have more than $1k capital gains income).
Do you have any scholarships that are dependent on your income? You should check.
Transferring in a large amount will raise a flag with the banks. Expect to be contacted or investigated asking how you received this income. Have your documentation prepared.
If you were audited, you would need to prove the original cost basis of any long-term coins. You say there is no record, so if the IRS doesn't believe you, they won't accept it and you'll pay short-term rates.
Bitcoin isn't a commodity, it's personal property.
@_date: 2014-03-16 23:08:39
Only the gains would be taxed on the re-bought coins when selling. I'm missing how this is double-taxed, as their cost basis would effectively be what you bought them back.
@_date: 2014-04-03 18:49:10
The US has a worldwide tax policy. No matter where you earn it, you must report it. However, some tax treaties exist with other counties to ensure you aren't double taxed.
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:06:38
Well, I believe you are still supposed to report all capital gains transactions, but you wouldn't owe any taxes if you didn't.
However, personally, I would report this because you can offset up to $2.5k of capital losses per year against your income. Less taxes to pay overall.
@_date: 2016-03-12 17:40:06
SK has no specific laws on digital currencies, although have said they are looking to regulate them in the future. So their gains would be treated the same as any other gains made from personal property. I would contact a local tax professional to get their opinion.

You can send a summary statement with the 8949. See the instructions.
I have seen some people say they were not able to get detailed histories of their trades, in which case they really have no choice but to estimate it. Unforuntely, as far as the IRS is concerned, the owness is always on you to get keep records. However, if they simply don't exist, you can only do what you can do.
Some advice would be to file everything as zero cost short-term, unless you can show dates and prices for trades.
Or, you can split trading per exchange and/or per coin. You know how much you put in, how much you got out, the difference is your income. Do this for each coin.
If you do have all the details that can be exported you can import it into the bitcointaxes.info website and we calculate the gains. Be aware we do not treat alt-coins are like-kind, so each altcoin is a tax event and gains are calculated.
You should reported as best as you can in good faith and be able to backup any claims you make, if you are unlucky enough to get audited.
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:09:48
You can set a percentage to not be converted. The only complication is that you have to work out those coins' cost basis as a percentage of that invoice for capital gains purposes. Rather than just knowing it if buying afterwards.
So, for example, say someone paid you $1,000. And you kept 20% in BTC. You still have to report $1,000 income, but that 1 BTC you received (say the price is $200 for simplicity) has a cost basis of $1,000 * 0.2. So the cost basis is $200 on that day, which you'll need to know when you come to sell/spend that Bitcoin.
But tomorrow, the price might be $220, so you only get 0.909 BTC but you still need to mark that 0.909 having a cost basis of $200.
@_date: 2015-01-27 06:06:15
You are supposed to report all sales in Schedule D. However, in the end you are including them to report and pay the taxes you owe, and losses wouldn't generate any tax. However, you might still want to think about it, as you can effectively give your self a tax rebate since the losses can be offset against your income and reduce taxes.

What are CG tax rates?
@_date: 2015-01-01 21:55:21
Sounds like you haven't added the cost basis from when you bought the altcoins. If we don't know when you bought them and for how much, we have to assume a 100% short-term gain when you sell them. Add details of their purchase (either as a BUY Trade or in the Opening Positions) and it'll work.

Set your rates in USD. Just let them pay in Bitcoin.
If you also do immediate exchange with Bitpay or Coinbase then this will make your accountant's (or your) life a lot easier. You won't have t worry about volatility, conversion rates or capital gains.
But if you do want to keep a portion, or all, of the coins you might still consider the above and then buy them back so you can clearly differentiate between capital gains and income.
@_date: 2015-01-02 00:17:57
Either import your Coinbase data, or just add them manually. I can help better if you send a support request.
@_date: 2015-01-16 17:54:14
No real tutorial. And it cannot be imported directly since it's not in the right format. Also TurboTax hasn't allowed imports into their web version only the desktop version, and then only 500 transactions. Maybe they'll change it for this year.
You will be importing the details into Schedule D Form 8949. Each line is a sale/spend of Bitcoins you made during the tax year, giving the date, proceeds in USD, cost of the coins originally and their date. The difference between the dates determine if it was long or short term (i.e. more than a year).
This information does exist in the Coinbase report, but you just have to extract the relevant columns.
If you've only used Coinbase (no other exchanges or wallets) then this enough to manually do your taxes, especially if you only have relatively few transactions.
If you've used other wallets and/or exchanges, owned coins from before 2014, or have a larger number of transactions, you might want to look into using our Bitcoin capital gains tax calculator at [
edit: TurboTax has changed their pricing so you must buy Premium ($80) or Business ($104) to file capital gains (Sch D), but you can import from mint.com in their online version. Cheaper and better alternatives, TaxACT for example, free or $13 with extra features.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:13:04
No. You don't have control of the BTC before they are spent.
Even if you did, they could be calculated with specific identification and match the "sell" of BTC to the "buy", which has the same price, and so no net gain or loss. Zero (or rounded to zero dollars) are not included on your tax forms.
@_date: 2015-01-05 16:28:42
There have been no test cases from audits yet, so we don't really know what they are going to expect. However, we do know what we can provide and the owness is always on you, the taxpayer, to keep sufficient records.
If you were audited by the IRS they would expect you to be be able to provide sufficient documentation to show that, for example, the loss you are claiming is valid. This is going to be the history and transaction from your Coinbase account and/or a receipt from the vendor.
They will also want to see how you arrived at the cost basis for the coins you spent. If everything is in Coinbase, it's not too difficult. But if you bought those coins on Bitstamp or elsewhere, you need to keep records of all your trades (i.e BTC prices, amounts and dates) and be able to show which coins you spent (in a FIFO fashion for instance) and so their original cost.
@_date: 2015-01-26 20:50:03
You can link and import all your Coinbase activity into  not only buying/selling, but also spending. All the capital gains are then worked out for you.
You definitely should keep a backup anyway (lessons learned from MtGox), especially as it as far as the IRS is concerned it is on you to keep records.
Use taxes are another things entirely, and really Bitcoin is no different than spending with a credit card to and out-of-state vendor that doesn't collect sales tax.
@_date: 2016-03-28 21:21:51
This is for Coinbase's own Beta tax report, which does this as it doesn't know the total picture of your coins and wallets. Any incoming coins are seen as acquisitions, since it doesn't know their cost basis. Similarly, outgoing coins are seen as dispositions at the fair market value.
This is obviously not the case for most people and why you shouldn't use their report unless you have only ever used Coinbase to buy/sell bitcoins.
 can aggregate all your trading from Coinbase and most other exchanges and calculate gains/losses and income. It can export as simple CSVs or directly into TurboTax. TaxACT or even print your Schedule D 8949 PDF.
@_date: 2014-03-25 23:08:37
Ha...I have no idea. I don't think they thought it through that much. Maybe you should send an official request for a ruling to the IRS just to see what they say. Please let me know their response :)
@_date: 2015-01-30 22:01:14
Easiest is to provide them with all your trades ready to import directly into your Schedule D Form 8949. This is the asset, cost basis date and value, proceeds date and value, and the gain/loss.
For capital gains you only need to include selling or spending, not buying. If you've mined or received some as payment, you need to include those as income separately.
You can use  to create the 8949 data.

Up to you. If you choose the First-In-First-Out then you are always spending the oldest. If you use Last-In-First-Out, you are spending the newest. Or use specific identification and choose which ever one you want, the one with the closest cost for example, to minimize gains.
There is no absolute ruling from the IRS on how you must treat crypto-currency here, although their default is First-In-First-Out and would not require you to recalculate past years if they ever formally decided.

Whenever you sell or spend coins you have to calculate the difference between that and what they cost you. That is your capital gains.
Capital gains are taxed as income at normal income tax rates unless you've held the coins for more than year, where you get a discounted tax rate of 0%, 15% or 20% depending on other income.
We added support for the Coinbase Exchange today in [ so you can just load up your trades as you go and see your liabilities.

As you say, you would be able to claim a capital loss if you bought the Bitcoins but not if you use the USD wallet. So what happens when you spend over $50?
Let's say the price is $200 and doesn't move over your transaction.
Instant: Buy something for $50. Your cost is $50.50 and comes out of your USD balance.
BTC: Spend $50.52 to get 0.2501 BTC. Send 0.25 BTC to recipient (plus your 0.0001 network fee) for a fair value of $50. You made a loss of $0.52, which rounds to $1, that can be claimed on your Schedule D.
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:34:23
It would, as it is part of the cost. However, this information might not be available, as different sites don't provide access to actual blockchain transaction.
But where we can, we track what leaves your wallet (e.g. Coinbase), not what the buyer received, and so it's already included. But if not, you could always manually alter the fee to include it.
The transaction fee you quoted is actually pretty high, and would more often be an order less, e.g 0.0001-0.0005 BTC, which in 2014 probably ranged $0.03 - $0.30. 
edit: even transaction fees transferring coins in and out of exchanges can be added as fees, as they are costs associated with your trading.
@_date: 2014-04-09 19:30:01


The answer is yes, obviously. What you would be doing is tax fraud.
The tax system in an honor system, so if you do or not is up to you. However, if you get caught and wilfully withheld your income you will be subject to civil penalties.
How will you get caught? If you deposit a large sum into a bank it gets flagged. That might cause an investigation. Anyone looking at you with no official income but yet someone manages to pay for your own college tuition is going to look into it.
Depending on your circumstances, you may even find you don't owe much taxes, if at all. If you can prove the coins you sell are older than a year, they are subject to long-term capital gains rates, which if you are on a lower income tax (I'm guessing you are) then the rate is 0% anyway.
If you are selling coins you have only owned for a year or less, then it is income, and is treated like normal. But if only $10k per year, depending on what else you earn, the tax is relatively low.
For all capital gains you need to fill out a 1040 tax form, entering the details in Schedule D. You can use TurboTax website or TaxAct and they pretty much step you through the whole process.

* Moved to new domain, bitcoin.tax
* Added income importing from Coinbase, BitPay, CEX.IO
* Added income importing from mining addresses with coin price lookup
* Adding spending, donations and gift/tips from Coinbase, Core/Qt Wallets, Blockchain.info
* Address and transaction viewer

* Support for Kraken and Poloniex (beta Circle import is coming)
* Optional *like-kind* treatment calculation
* Automatic calculation of opening position and cost-basis
* Income report
* Donation/Gifts cost-basis report
For 2014, the free version now supports any alt-coin, all calculation methods and all exports up to 100 transactions. An unlimited Premium version is available.
@_date: 2016-03-04 23:05:57
You can if you have 100 or less transactions, as that is free. Otherwise we charge per tax year. Right now we have packages for the current filing year (i.e. 2015) and previous years (2010-2014). You can also prepay 2016 to be able to monitor this year's activity.
You likely want 2015, and perhaps 2014 (if you have more than 100 transactions). If you only want 2014 (not 2010-2014), I'll give you a special discount code.
@_date: 2016-03-28 21:37:31


They don't care. You just report any gains you make when you spend them.
@_date: 2016-03-06 16:35:54


You calculate taxes on gains made per year. Losses are carried forward in your tax return up to a maximum of $3k, which would lower your 2015 taxable income.
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:58:27
If you were hacked and the coins stolen, you would have to file a casualty loss instead. However, you can only claim the cost basis of the coins, not their potential value.
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:18:11
No, it penalizes miners who keep coins for investment and the price drops.
If you mine and sell immediately, you only have to pay tax on that income. If you then and bought back in at the same price, you are investing and take the risk that the price will go up or down.
In the end it's no different, but miners are not wanting to pay taxes when the price goes down. It'd be different if the price went up.
@_date: 2015-01-18 08:18:38
Like in the US, really as long as you don't underpay your taxes and don't give incorrect information, then there is no penalty. So setting your initial basis to zero would ensure that.
However, if you had trades in Gox before Dec 2013 they probably can be recovered from the leaked data that was released in 2014. You can still search around and find it. Or, we have been [offering a service]( to create a CSV. Fill the form in or send me a PM and I'll see what's in there for you.

No. That's not to say they won't "clarify" it in the future. So for now since FIFO is the IRS's default method, using it would ensure you don't owe any back taxes if this happened.

If you give (i.e. gift) someone Bitcoins, there are no tax implications unless the amount is above $14k, where you'll pay gift tax. (US only).
The recipient will have to declare gains when they sell or spend then, potentially paying taxes.
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:32:38
Generally, yes. You declare any gains you might have made but how much taxes you pay depends on where you live.
If you are in the US, all outgoing transactions (selling, spending, trading alt-coins, gambling) are tax events and you need to calculate potential gains and losses. These are reported in your 1040 Schedule D.
Similar rules exist in most other countries, but the amounts vary. In the UK, for example, there is a capital gains allowance of £11,000. So if you are below that, you don't have to worry about it.
@_date: 2017-02-13 04:10:36
Thanks for saying.
I had wanted to have this do frequent updates, but you end up with some imports accurate and some (e.g. CSV) not. I decided that it's not part of this tool, but the next.
The next version is what I'm working on in my spare time. So as well as being what bitcoin.tax is, it will keep data up date, and also track where coins are. So you can see your complete holdings and their costs and profits.
Any other ideas welcome.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:36:53


The difference is your capital gains. Each one is taxed as a short-term capital gain, reported on 1040 Schedule D.
@_date: 2015-01-12 06:38:03
Yes, capital losses are deducted against any gains first, and then up to a maximum of $3,000 income per year.
If you have more losses you can carry them forward to next year and do the same until they are all deducted.
So if you made a loss this year, make sure you declare it, it's free money.
@_date: 2015-01-20 23:18:07
Yes, it is under the current IRS rules. It's a tax event and you are spending capital property for goods/services, which could create a gain or loss.
It's one of the big issues with the IRS guidelines, that in effect it's unworkable for many people.
However, if you bought a coffee for $5 spending part of a Bitcoin you owned than itself was worth $4.90, that gain's going to round to zero anyway and so not be included.
But say you bought a new computer for $3,000 using BTC you got when they were only $10 each,  you've made a significant gain. That's clearly included.
We do all this for you at [
@_date: 2015-01-09 22:32:45
You are obviously required to file and correct taxes from past year. You can file a 1040X with the correct figures.
Will you? That's your decision.
If you do, you should pay the owed taxes as soon as possible to reduce any late payment interest (0.5% per month from April of the filing year).
Gambling losses can be deducted against gambling winnings, but nothing else. You can't claim capital losses, so it sounds like you just owe tax on your previous gains.
Of course, online gambling may not even be legal where you live, so you should get advice on that one.
@_date: 2015-01-21 16:58:59
This is true. Since you have no control of the Bitcoins that are bought and spent on your behalf.
Although you are still paying a 1% fee.
Other exchanges do offer no or low fees, so for large purchases it might be worth looking at your options. Plus if you buy your coins and then spend then with a similar price, or using LIFO, you'll have no net gain or loss anyway. But you do have to keep records in this case and [calculate the potential gains]( whereas not with the Coinbase USD wallet. Pros and cons.
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:11:15
So what is the point of "losing" your keys? I thought you were thinking it was some way to avoid taxes. If they were stolen or mishandled (e.g MtGox) you could try and enter a casualty loss. But if you just lost then, you just wasted money.
@_date: 2017-02-10 17:00:53

@_date: 2016-01-29 00:30:30
They don't explicitly, since there are no 1099 forms being sent to them. So they will use normal tax fraud flags and random audits.
Sending BTC between wallets or exchanges has no tax implications, and doesn't need to be reported. Only when it is turned into fiat (e.g. USD) or another asset (i.e. spending).
@_date: 2016-03-03 23:53:21
Did you choose 2014 (rather than 2015) when importing the transactions? We work a tax year at a time, so you need to select the tax year to work on.
You calculate your gains/income/balances and it is then carried forward into the next year.
@_date: 2016-01-24 04:52:06
No problem. I just don't think that everyone is aware of all the implications of treating digital-currency as a currency vs. assets. Good and bad. The long-term gains tax rate deductions is a positive, whereas the record-keeping is a negative. It could required a new classification by the IRS since it doesn't quite neatly fit into one or the other.

Assume you are in the US. If you've been accepting Bitcoin, you just treat that as normal income for the fair market value (as if you were paid in USD). i.e. if you did a job for $1,000 and paid in Bitcoin, you have $1,000 taxable income, reported on your 1040 Schedule C or corp business income. If you priced in BTC, e.g. 1 BTC, then use the daily price - you can use any consistent source, e.g. bitcoinaverage.com
You now also need to track the cost basis of those coins for when you come to sell or spend them - e.g. the above would haven been $1,000. If you sell or spend any Bitcoin, you have to calculate potential capital gains/losses. So, say you sold the coins you received from above for $1,200, you now have $200 capital gains income, reported in 1040 Schedule D.
If you accepting Bitcoin through a provider but they automatically convert to USD for you, then you don't have to worry about capital gains, it's just USD taxable income.
Here are some [common questions and answers]( or feel free to ask anything.

Right. Bitcoin is treated as a capital asset so and gains are taxed as capital gains. Good news is long-term gains (owned for more than a year) have a reduced tax rate from 0% to 20% depending on your other income.
I run bitcoin.tax that helps work this out. Here is a something recent that might help with some common questions:

I don't know much about gold mining, but doing it as a business for investment or inventory would likely defer the income. However, if you found a gold nugget in your back yard, unfortunately as far as the IRS is concerned, you have income of its market value.
They were very clear in their guidance in 2014 (2014-21) that mined digital currency was income.
Rest assured, if you get money from somewhere, the IRS wants their cut!

No, Coinbase don't report directly to the IRS. They can produce a tax report, but this is only useful is you've solely used Coinbase, as they don't include external cost basis.
Earning Bitcoin is likely treated as normal income (depending on how you earned it) and reported as such but in USD - you can use the daily price.
Selling Bitcoin into USD where you make a profit (or loss) is capital gains (Schedule D).
If you earned those coins during 2015 then they the income will need to be reported in this coming tax return. When you sell your coins, any gains will be reported in that tax year.

You're welcome.
Well, we'll see. If this were currency, e.g. you were buying things in EUR and had to include it on your taxes, you are supposed to pick a USD/EUR rate table and use it consistently for the whole tax year. e.g. oanda.com
I imagine they treat it the same with crypto-currencies.
However, bear in mind that most of the time you don't actually have to look up rates. This only really applies
1) When you are spending a coin where there is no fair value, e.g. buying XYZ coin with BTC, where XYZ has no USD market, so you can't calculate a fair value. In this case you need to lookup BTC against USD.

Let's assume you are in the US and talking about long-term capital gains, because if not, it's just income and not much you can do.
1. Gift and spread the coins to a low-income family members. They'll pay 0% capital gains taxes. 
2. If you already donate to charity, use your coins instead. You'll be able to deduct the full value and the charity can have the long-term benefit.
3. If you have other capital losses not yet realized, do it in the same tax year so you can offset your gains.
4. Die. Bit extreme, I know, but the cost basis will be on the date of death for the inheritance, which could be higher and so less taxes.

Not directly. If you use an exchange, like any bank, they will be reporting any suspicious activity as part of their KYC processes.
There is no real hard $10k "kick in", as your accounts are also monitored for structuring, where you are moving sums over time.
Ask yourself is it worth it. If you got audited you could faces penalties for tax evasion. You might even be at a loss, so could get a tax deduction.

Why would you think it has no value? Can you not sell your bitcoin for $1000? That's it's market value.
Bitcoin is classified as a personal asset and so taxed like one. If you mine bitcoin, you have income. If you sell bitcoin, you have capital gains/losses. If you barter bitcoin, you have effectively sold to the market value of what you purchased.

It's difficult for individual exchanges to do this themselves, since they would have to have you enter cost basis for every deposit, which most people don't actually track.
Coinbase (but not GDAX) do produce a report, but it's usually meaningless because of this as well as them every withdrawal is recorded as spending at the daily rate.

In the US, trading between digital currencies is more than likely a tax event. You are disposing of one asset to buy another. I say likely only because the IRS hasn't specifically clarified this point.
In the [IRS 2014-21 notice](




Also, the alternative would be that you would file it as an 8824 like-kind exchange. But two different digital currencies probably wouldn't meets the tests, since they must be of the same classification. In the same way the IRS use the example that a car and truck aren't the same, BTC and ETH, for example, clearly aren't either.

One workaround is to enter your summary values, or a single 8949 entry and then mail in an attachable statement. However, TurboTax have changed the way you declare you want to attach a statement in their 2016 version and I haven't found the correct procedure. I still have a support query outstanding with them.
The only alternative is to use TaxACT instead, since it can do importing.

I created  (formally bitcointaxes.info) back at the end of 2013 for calculate digital currency capital gains. 
Libra have been trying to catch up since they launched late 2014, but I strongly believe we are better in many areas, e.g. supporting more exchanges and wallets, all altcoins, margin trading, like-kind calculations, major world currencies, a fully-functioning free version, integration with tax services like TurboTax and TaxACT, and creating the necessary PDF forms.
There are, however, open-source calculators available if you search in github. Some try and calculate based on transactions between wallets, which is fundamentally flawed, since it's like taxing transfers between bank accounts and ignore intra-exchange transactions. The others tend to be limited to a single exchange, which isn't useful if you have moved or spent coins.
As for being open-source, it has little need mainly since there are no real security implications, unlike Bitcoin wallets that benefit from peer-review. While you could argue tax calculation algorithms could be reviewed, they are already commonly known. But as a business, our implementation is our intellectual property, and what enables us, for instance, to import and calculate gains in a few seconds as opposed to minutes within Libra.

Since Bitcoin are taxed as property, there would be a tax event when she sold or spent them, and she has to be aware of potential capital gains.
Since it's a gift, you can transfer the cost basis to her. This means when she sells she can use what she sells them for - that cost, as her capital gain. This is useful if you held them for more than a year, since there is a long-term discounted tax rate.
Spending is treated like selling, the amount you "sold" them being the value of whatever you bought.
@_date: 2017-03-20 04:45:23
Then you're fine. If you are holding and never sold or spent any then there is nothing you need to do.
I suggest you make sure you have copies of your records from Coinbase just in case anything goes horribly wrong - everyone lost their account histories when MtGox and Cryptsy shut down.

You are trading one for the other. You are either keeping one coin and gaining another.
If like ETH/ETC, then your original coins would remain unchanged. The new ones will become income the date you had control of them. That will also be their cost basis going forward.

You don't pay taxes on the net profit by combining 2014 and 2015. First, you have to calculate the capital gains/losses in 2014, pay taxes or take deductions. Then you separately calculate 2015's profits or losses, and similarly pay taxes or declare losses.
If you had losses from 2014 you can carry them forward in your 1040, up to a maximum of $3,000.
Bitcoin.tax doesn't know about your 1040, so the tax is an estimate based only on the capital gains/losses in that tax year.
A combined profit of $300 in 2014 and 2015 is irrelevant for taxes. The tax estimate for $777 is based on 2015's capital gains only.

Split into lots of cost basis for each sale using FIFO (First-In First-Out) i.e. you sell your oldest lots first.
    Buy 0.1 for $60
    Buy 0.1 for $65
    Buy 0.2 for $130
You say "sell at $400". I'm going to assume you meant sell 0.4 for $400.
    Sell 0.1 for $100 = (100-60) = $40
    Sell 0.1 for $100 = (100-65) = $35
    Sell 0.2 for $200 = (200-130) = $70
Total gains = $145.
The dates are also important as if longer than a year between selling and buying and they will be long-term capital gains.
@_date: 2017-03-07 05:45:48
No. If you never sold or spent, and therefore have no realized gains, you have no income and so owe no taxes. 
However, if you traded alt-coins, or sold but then re-bought just never moved the USD out of the exchange, you could owe taxes. Those are tax events and you have potential capital gains or losses.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:18:58
You report any capital gains/losses in Schedule D of 1040. The proceeds from your sale less the cost of your purchase.
@_date: 2017-03-18 23:03:26
Sort of, but not for that reason.
You have income of the 1 BTC you mined on the date you received it. So say the daily price was $1,000 then you have $1,000 reportable income. The cost basis for that 1 BTC is now $1000.
When you come to sell, at say $1100, you have $100 short-term capital gains income.
Now, as it happens, short-term capital gains income is taxed like normal income, so in the end you are paying your standard tax rate.
If you had waited a year and sold you would have long-term capital gains, which would be 0%. (15% or 20% if you have more normal income).
Using a Bitcoin ATM card is treated like selling those BTC for that amount of USD. If you withdrew $100 (for 0.1 BTC) you effectively sold 0.1 BTC for $100 and have to calculate potential capital gains.
@_date: 2017-03-18 22:59:13
Yes, but as I said, the dates are also important so you can possibly claim long-term gains.
If you sold in parts, you have to split it further.
Say you sold 0.3 and then 0.1 later
You have 
    Sell 0.1 for $100 (100-60)
    Sell 0.1 for $100 (100-65)
    Sell 0.1 for $100 (100-65)
and then
    Sell 0.1 for $100 (100-65)

(1) You don't have to declare holdings or purchases. For selling, trading, or spending, you need to calculate potentials gains/loss and these are reported as capital gains on your 1040 Schedule D.
(2) Yes, but the IRS hasn't clarified. It is an exchange of property that would be a tax event and you have to account for any gains as if you sold. Some people will tell you they are "like-kind" and so you can just transfer cost basis. It's unlikely BTC and ABC coin would meet the tests to be accepted as a like-kind exchange.

Whilst it would obviously be useful if Coinbase still gives access to historic heroic for closed accounts, as far as the IRS is concerned, taxpayers have the responsibility to maintain records.
Everyone should periodically download account details for Coinbase, and any other exchange they use, in case of other issues.
The main issue would be that, in an audit, you might not be able to sufficiently show the cost basis or date of purchased coins. Those long-term gains might instead be taxed as short-term, at greater value, and without any capital loss deductions.
@_date: 2016-01-23 22:05:48
You compare Bitcoin to foreign currency in your article, but don't mention that fiat has a $200 gain threshold. If you made more than that you would need to declare income - and there is no long-term deduction with currency.
Since Bitcoin isn't taxed as currency, it benefits from long-term reduced rates, albeit more complicated record-keeping.
I'm going to disagree with you on Libra vs Bitcoin.tax. We launched Bitcoin.Tax (formally bitcointaxes.info) back the start of 2014 and have better tools, a wider range of supported exchanges/wallets, and can export to TurboTax, TaxACT, and 8949 PDFs.

It must have hit a nerve back in Nov, because we saw a significant bump in users. Nothing anywhere near the 3-4 million users that could have gains though!
I can kind of understand people think this is magical tax avoidance money, and they'll never get caught, but when you make money (like gains) to think you don't owe taxes is just naive. Plus if you had losses, it almost is free money.
The IRS has less funding year after year, so them coming after individuals maybe less likely. But if they win this case, be sure they target every user (gains or no gains) to scare them into checking and paying.

Next, yes, till the IRS classifies digital currencies anything other than capital property then you are going to have this issue.
So technically, right now, you must report every transaction as it is a tax event and you need to calculate capital gains. Fortunately, in many small transactions your gains are going to be negligible and so not taxed (gains less than $0.50 are rounded to zero).

You only have capital gains/losses when you sell or spend, which would be in 2017, so included in your tax return you file in April 2018.
Keep records of the cost basis, because when you do come to spend or sell them, you will have to work out if you made a profit (difference between what you sold for and what you bought for) and that is included in your 1040 Schedule D.

This is not a new idea, I wrote about the need for wallets to be more "tax friendly" back in [2014]( but the problem is the decentralized nature of Bitcoin itself.
Unfortunately, the only time this 1099 would be correct is if you **only** used Coinbase, only spent directly through Coinbase, and told then so. You would effectively not be able to transfer coins to other exchanges, other wallets, and give them details of the USD value of every time you spent.
The obvious issues are:
* Coinbase doesn't know the cost basis of any deposited coins, and you would have to give them this information
* They can't differentiate between you spending and transferring
* If you did spend, you would have to tell them the USD value
* Coins transferred out might come back with a different basis
* Coinbase only supports BTC, ETH and LTC. 
* If Coinbase reports your gains incorrectly (likely) you will have to prove your actual figures to the IRS
@_date: 2017-01-05 00:06:52
Capital gains rates depend on your other income and how long you have owned the coins you are selling/spending.
You only pay tax on any profit you make, and if you owned the coins for more than a year, it is "long-term" gains which has a reduced rate. Otherwise it is "short-term" and taxed the same as normal income.
So if you are in the lower brackets (single and earn less $37,651 pa) then you'll pay normal tax for any short-term gains but 0% for long-term gains.
In higher brackets (single and earn at least $37,651 pa) then you'll pay normal tax for any short-term gains but 15% for long-term gains.
@_date: 2016-06-16 16:40:25
Profit made from trading Bitcoin is treated as capital gains/losses. But you are only paying taxes on profit you make. Nonetheless, you would have to calculate the profit/loss after each trade.

Yes, and this is good practice. Keep one for investment and one for spending so you can more easily get long-term gains benefits. You must ensure completely separate wallets and also exchange accounts so the coins could never be mixed.
You would still have to check for gains made in your spending account, and spend coins in a FIFO manner, but any gains should be smaller. Of course, you'll also want to check for losses and sum them for the year to reduce any liability.
@_date: 2017-01-22 21:53:31
I'm can't offer tax advice, and not going to go against your own CPA's advice. I can see his point, especially if you kept these coins separate from any investment or longer-term coins. First, you are doing an immediate exchange where the gain is always going to be zero, since there is no time-delay. But also, if you never actually had control of those coins, i.e it was done by a service like Coinbase, then you are effective buying with USD.
The only issue is that guidance from the IRS has been so lacking, so a log of these issues have no clear answers. But that's what your CPA is for.
@_date: 2017-01-11 00:42:09
First, Coinbase don't report capital gains to the IRS, you do. If they did, you would receive a 1009 tax form. But they don't know the cost basis of your coins, so couldn't make that determination.
Your scenarios are no different from each other.
Altcoin trading is still a tax event, and each trade requires calculated any gains/losses of the BTC you disposed. Total all your trading and come up with a net capital gain. This is reported on your taxes.
If you need to work it all out, I run a website  that can help.
@_date: 2017-08-03 06:28:49
If you had control of these coins then you basically have income of fair market value. Like mining, you created coins which are taxed as immediate income.
However, if you can't get at them or can't sell them, then there is no market so they have no value. Also, there is no consistent price that you could quote.
The easiest options is to treat it as zero cost basis. If you choose to take the coins and sell them, then you have 100% capital gains income. If you sell that within the year, then it's just going to be taxed as normal income anyway.
@_date: 2017-01-12 16:56:03
Basically, no one knows, because the IRS hasn't clarified.
Like-kind would have to be allowed under a Section 1031 exchange, but would exclude crypto-currencies if they don't meet the tests. It must be for investment or business purposes and cannot be inventory or stock. Also a portion does not qualify if it is exchanged for cash or other property.
It is unlikely the IRS would allow like-kind treatment (why would they), but it simply isn't known for sure. If you do decide to treat alt-coin trading as like-kind, you should be prepared to recalculate past taxes if the IRS rejects it in the future.
@_date: 2016-06-17 05:29:26
Yes, when you sell it. There is nothing if you've just bought and held it. But when you sell it, you need to calculate the difference between what you bought and sold it for. This could be gains or losses and combine toward your year's capital gains figure.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:50:38
By default, you would use first-in-first-out (FIFO), meaning you would use the first one you owned. You could use other methods, like Last-In-First-Out but it should be used consistently and not for the purpose of avoiding taxes.
The better approach is to keep two wallets. One for investment and one for spending. That way you can show they never merged and so can distinguish between long-term and short-term coins.
@_date: 2017-01-30 16:42:36
Keep two wallets. One for investment or longer-term coins, and one for spending coins that is refilled then spent.
You then only have to worry about potential gains when you spend coins from the first wallet. When you spend from the second, you are buying then spending(selling) at the same price, so there would be no gains.

Mining is just income at the fair market value. So if you mined 1 BTC today, you will have to declare $3,370 income.
Selling, trading or spending is a tax event and subject to capital gains/losses.
So if you sold that 1 BTC above (the income value also set its cost basis) for $3,500 then you will declare (3500-3370)=$130 capital gains. You can also take off any fee you paid, exchange or transfer fees for example.
If you sell in a year or less, it is short-term capital gains, which is taxed at the same rate as your normal income. If you held the coins for over a year, you can use long-term capital gains, which has a reduced tax rate of typically 15%, but also 0%.
Capital gains are recorded in Schedule D of your 1040. Income is either recorded on 1040 Line 21 or, if self-employed, in Schedule C.

Right. Like-kind is another issue, and for that I would get tax advice. Some accountants think it will be okay, and some think it fails the 1031 tests.

Above is wrong, any disposition of property is a tax event.
A transaction fee is spending for a service, to transfer funds. The 0.3 mBTC itself is not a tax, must be calculated in USD and any potential capital gains calculated, e.g. you paid $1.20 for the service, which you acquired for $0.20, so you made $1 profit. Fortunately, gains are most likely negligible or round to zero, but you are still supposed to report everything in your Schedule D.
If you are paying the fee in order to move money related to a trade, e.g. transferring into your Coinbase wallet to sell, you can remove it from the proceeds you would receive.

Yes, you have $200 capital gains income (in the US and many other countries).

I agree. Using a daily price is not how most people treated the ETH/ETC split. Using a zero cost basis still incurs the same amount of taxes if you sold within the year but has no income for anyone who does nothing.

All capital gains transactions are reported in 1040 Schedule D, Form 8949. There is no minimum, however, gains under $0.50 will round down to zero.
This would include whenever you sold Bitcoin (or any digital currency) on an exchange, spent some coins, or traded alt-coins.
For each transaction, you need to work out the difference between your sale amount/market value and the cost basis (less fees). This is your capital gain or loss.
If you held the coins for over a year, they are "long-term" gains and qualify for a reduced tax rate (down to 0% depending on your other income).
Short-term gains (owned for a year or less) are taxed as income.
[Bitcoin.tax]( can help work this out for you.
If you haven't reported gains in previous years' taxes, you may want to consult a [tax specialist]( or check if you need to file an amendment.

Don't worry about it. There are no taxes/gains when you transfer. Coinbase's report is purely "for information only" and has to make an assumption in this regard.
You are responsible for reporting your capital gains to the IRS, not Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-10 17:36:13


This means using Bitcoin is treated as spending foreign currency, which is an asset and so incurs gains. See Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 21b.
However, you still have your allowance.
@_date: 2017-01-31 02:05:27
No problem. Absolute separation is best, literally so the coins can never be mixed. What you don't want is the IRS claiming in an audit that you couldn't keep track of which coin you spent, therefore all reduced long-term gains are void.

I didn't miss anything. Turning over customer data isn't the same as reporting Coinbase's "tax report" as an official source of income.

No, because you can selectively choose which inputs to spend as outputs (see [Coin Control](

NO, no, no.
Coinbase aren't reporting transfers as sales to the IRS.
When you transfer coins, there is no gain, so no tax.
Only **you** can report what bitcoin gains and income you earned, and include on your own 1040. If you're reporting transfers, then don't.

No one knows what will happen with the IRS and Coinbase. However, it's likely that anyone who had sold Bitcoins, spent Bitcoins, transferred coins out or even had an account, could be looked into (in that order).
If you sold or spent and didn't file capital gains in those tax years, you possibly have unpaid taxes (assuming your made a gain). You should at least work it out so you can show it, or show you only have losses.
You could speak to a tax expert who has knowledge of Bitcoin, we have some listed here:
It's likely they'll advise you to file amendments for past years, if you had made gains.
* To work this out, you just need to take any proceeds from selling (or value of spending) from the cost of those coins when you bought them. If that's complicated, I created an online tool that does it for you at  or you can get one of the tax experts to do it.
* There are no reporting or taxes for merely owning coins. Only when you realize a gain, which is potentially by selling, spending or trading. Nothing to worry about and nothing to declare for you paper wallets.
* Sounds like an ideal opportunity to educate him of crypto-currencies. At the very least, you can work out your own gains and just give them to him.
* If you trust Coinbase as a service, then leave them there. If you want your own control, move them to a paper wallet or your own software wallets. I hear some people have had issues, but I never had, and have both a person account and business account with them.
Feel free to post or PM if you have any specific questions.
@_date: 2016-12-28 21:02:34
Not really. You don't owe tax immediately, it is summed annually. Your tax bill isn't due to April of the following year, so it wouldn't work out like that in reality.
@_date: 2017-08-11 15:35:12
Track all your buying, selling, and spending. Exchanges provide all the data you need so you can calculate any owed income or capital gains.
@_date: 2016-12-13 16:53:03
First, when selling, think of Bitcoin as merely a payment method. Normal sales or value-added (VAT) taxes still apply and have to be reported to your local government in their home currency. This matters because if you sell only in BTC prices, you still need to work out the fiat value and charge any appropriate sales taxes.
Once you've collected the monies, your coins are treated like any other capital property, and so any gains you make are taxable as per your country's tax rules.

Unlikely. Besides, Coinbase has no interpretation, it's just a report they produce for you. But it's pretty meaningless. The IRS will be quite clear in demanding proof of gains if you get audited.
@_date: 2016-11-18 23:40:29
Unfortunately one of the reasons why their own capital gains tax calculator isn't useful to many people.
It can't distinguish between spending and transferring, it has no knowledge of spent USD value (if not a Coinbase merchant) and doesn't track incoming cost basis.
@_date: 2016-12-03 02:19:28
As I posted in other threads, and Coinbase have now confirmed, no, they aren't taxing your Bitcoins.
But they are assuming you have disposed of your coins in their own tax report. This is their safe ground, but you should ignore it and work it out yourself.
If you only use Coinbase (no wallets, no other exchanges, received no Bitcoins from any other source, never sent them to anyone), then this tax report would work.
But if not,
1. Track the cost basis of all your own coins. Record the date, volume, price you paid plus any fees.
2. Whenever you sell, trade or spend, this is a tax event so record the date, volume, amount received (in USD) less any fees.
3. Each of those should be reported in your 1040, Schedule D, Form 8949. You will have to work out the difference between your sale/spend (2) and your cost (1). If positive, this is capital gains and is taxable. Anything negative, is a capital loss, and can be used to reduce other gains.
If this is too complicated, there are online tools to help.

@_date: 2017-08-30 17:35:32
Hopefully this will explain the basics:
If exchanges reported to the IRS you would also received a form. None do for capital gains, as far as I know, but Coinbase will file a 1099K if you are a merchant over the limits.
If you don't know cost basis, will be either have to estimate and have some documentation to back it up, or worse case, treat it as zero.
@_date: 2016-12-09 17:11:27
No one know who the IRS will come after, but if you sold coins within Coinbase and didn't file any capital gains income, you are a potential target.
That said, you should first work out if, and how much, you would owe. Sounds like you were in the 15% bracket, so it is something, unless they were long-term capital gains (owned the Bitcoins for over a year) in which case you wouldn't pay anything.
It isn't too much effort to file an amendment, you should look into doing it yourself. All you will be doing is to include your capital gains income and new tax amounts. You will obviously have to pay it along with interest and a potential fine.
Or, take your information to a tax specialist, who can do it for you. $700 seems a lot, so definitively shop around.
@_date: 2016-12-03 17:54:12
No, in the same way you don't owe any taxes because you withdraw some cash from your bank account at the ATM. You are just moving money/assets around.
You pay taxes on income. Moving coins doesn't create income. 
Selling coins, spending, exchanging for other coins, could create income as you are disposing of an asset for a value. If that results in a gain, that gain is taxable.
@_date: 2016-11-18 21:59:06
You could calculate the gains made when spending, and file an amendment to your 2014 tax return, with the details in Schedule D - that would be short-term capital gains.
If you didn't have hard figures, estimate it.
Of course, it depends what the gains are. The IRS are mostly interested in tax evasion. If you made no gains, there is no tax to pay.
The next issue is what to do when you spend what's left, as you will want to be able to provide you owned them since 2014 to get the discounted long-term tax rate.
If you can't show when you received them (date and value), then any gains could be treated like income, and worst-case, with a zero cost basis (i.e. 100% income).
@_date: 2016-12-17 20:22:23


You don't have any gains. No need to report anything.
@_date: 2016-12-16 05:15:18


You could have capital gains from those, so should calculate if you do.
The transfers you can ignore. They aren't tax events, so nothing for you to do or declare.

I'm from [bitcoin.tax]( just came across this, and think it's a good idea, especially since there are new things that might be relevant for filing next year.
I didn't realize there was a meetup for bitcoin and taxes. I've been and done a talk to my local Bitcoin group a year or so ago. However, an online version would reach more people.

Bitcoin rising to $1,000 is irrelevant unless you are selling and making a profit.
Income you make is taxable, that's how the world works. Income from your job, interest from your bank account, profit from your stocks. And profit from your Bitcoin.
If you sell 1 BTC at $1,000 that you bought at $700, you have $300 income, which is declared on your tax forms and any applicable taxes due.
@_date: 2016-12-02 20:59:04
You report your capital gains to the IRS, not Coinbase. Their tax report is just a report, not submitted to the IRS. If it's incorrect, don't use it.

Thanks, glad it's useful. Also good to see Coinbase have clarified their report interpretation.

Irrelevant, different type of tax.
Whenever you make any gains from digital currencies, like selling or spending bitcoins, those gains are capital gains income and income is taxable.
You effectively have $30 taxable income. The amount of tax you'll pay depending on 1) how long you owned the coins for, and 2) your tax rate from your other income that year.


First, these aren't the same, Bitcoin isn't taxes like houses. Secondly, you didn't do a direct exchange - you have two tax events, selling and then re-buying.
@_date: 2016-12-02 21:00:34
All of them. It's a tax event whenever you dispose of an asset. For each you have to work out the gains/losses in USD and they are reported in 1040 Schedule D.
@_date: 2016-12-02 16:57:45
No, they aren't taxing your Bitcoins. But they are assuming you have disposed of your coins in their own tax report. This is their safe ground, but you can ignore it and work it out yourself.
Unfortunately, their approach is more likely to be wrong, and the reason you shouldn't use the Coinbase tax report if you have other wallets or use other exchanges.
In the same way they assume the cost basis of any coins transferred in to be the price as of that day. This is also wrong, but it is all they can do since it is all they know.
If you only use Coinbase (no wallets, no other exchanges, received no Bitcoins from any other source, never sent them to anyone), then this tax report will work.
But if not,
1. Track the cost basis of all your own coins. Record the date, volume, price you paid plus any fees.

If you are just transferring Bitcoins around between wallets/exchanges, there are no gains and nothing to report.
If you are sending Bitcoins to your bank account that is being converted to USD, then you may have taxes, as you may have capital gains. You need to work out the difference between what you paid for them and what you receive in USD. This is your capital gain income and so taxable. (if it is negative, you can claim a capital loss).
Some basic info here: 
@_date: 2017-01-06 16:51:55
They tax income. If you received payment of any kind, e.g. BTC, you have to calculate the appropriate value in pounds. 
This is either the fair value (e.g. you did a job worth £1,000 but paid in BTC, your income is £1,000) or a daily price (e.g. you were paid 1 BTC when the BTC/GBP price was £300, you have £300 income).
On top of that you might have capital gains when you sell your Bitcoin. If you earned 1 BTC worth £300 and sold it a year later for £1,000, you have £700 capital gains. However, you don't need to report any gains until your total gains (including any other, like stocks, and so on) goes over the tax year's allowance, which is £11,100 for 2016/17.
@_date: 2016-12-30 05:42:26


No, obviously that's not right. You didn't sell them when you transferred them. You transferred them.
@_date: 2016-11-18 23:45:19
See section "Long Term and Short Term Gains". Depending on your other income, all long-term capital gains are taxed at 0%, 15% or 20%.

Assuming you are in the US (your post history uses $), then yes, any time you traded you have a tax event where you need to calculate capital gains.


Each one of those is disposing of an asset, either to fiat or something of fair value. Calculate the profit/loss on each. Since it's been this year, you don't have long-term to worry about and your total taxable gain is just the sum of all those, which might even be a loss that you can deduct (against other gains and up to $3k of income).
I run a website that makes working this out easier, 


This is irrelevant. If you have control over the account then there is no difference.
Be aware, if you used a foreign exchange and had over $10k in fiat currency across all your foreign balances at any time during the year, you also need to file a FBAR with FinCEN. There are serious penalties if you don't.
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:22:49
If an exchange is going to give you a tax form, they will send it to you. However, most exchanges don't have to report anything. There are exceptions, like 1099-K for payment income, which you might get from Coinbase if you were a merchant.
Otherwise it is honoring reporting. You need to keep your own records and report any capital gains events with their gains/losses, which are taxable.

Any bitcoin income you made as part of your business would normally be treated as being paid in foreign currency. You can keep a separate ledger and pay out business expenses (not personal) in Bitcoin. At the end of your tax year you would work out your taxable income in GBP and pay corp taxes as necessary.
A lot depends on how you've structured the company, e.g. LTD or not, since paying your own living expenses is in effect drawing a salary. If you are just sole trader, it's all just going to be taxed as regular income. 
Your accountant is the best person for this, since they'll see what you've done and your circumstances. If they are confused with what Bitcoin is, just tell them HMRC treat it as currency, and point them at 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:15:26
Taxes are due when you sell your Bitcoins at a profit. So if you bought 1 BTC for 200 and later sold (or spent in US) for 250, you made 50 profit. That 50 profit is called Capital Gains income, and is taxable. You get the 50, but you may owe taxes on at the end of the year, so it is prudent to put around 25% (12.50) away and not spend it, in case you need to pay those taxes.
Countries tax capital gains differently, depending on the amount and how long you had owned the Bitcoin. In the UK, it's taxed as normal income, but there is a roughly £10k allowance. In the US, it's taxed as normal income if it was owned for less than a year, or as "long-term" with a reduced tax rate if owned for more than a year.
When you earn income as a minor, depending where live you can choose to declare it independently or as part of your parent's income, and the choice usually comes down to how much it is.
In the US, for example, your first $1,000 income is tax free. Up to $2,000 you'll pay the normal low rates but above there you are paying your parent's top rate - i.e. you don't get a long-term gain allowance.
If you've made enough gains that requires filing, you'll need to tell your parents so they can find the best way to file the taxes.
@_date: 2017-11-14 16:19:47
You don't file 1099s, you would get a 1099 from Coinbase if they consider you received income, e.g. as a merchant or payment processor. Individuals wouldn't likely get one.
Individuals file any gains/losses as part of reporting capital gains in Schedule D.

No. Scams aren't tax-free.
Now, if they were stolen you could possibly claim a casualty loss, as long as you can prove it. But after the casualty loss reduction ($100 + 10% loss + 2% AGI) you probably have nothing left anyway.

The value of the BTC now is irrelevant unless you plan on selling. Otherwise, the trades where you bought and sold your altcoins are tax events^* and you need to check if gains/losses were made.
e.g. You could have made gains when you bought the altcoins (because you sold BTC) and made a loss when you sold them back for BTC.
Use  (I run it) to put your trading numbers in and it'll show you what you net gain/loss would be.
^* Some accountants think this could be reported as a 1031 like-kind exchange. If you are advised you could do this by your tax professional, then there would be no tax event until you go back to USD.

Sell them at a loss.
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:13:21
Please check with your accountant for advice. You can pass the cost basis as part of the gift, so your friend can take on the purchase date and price and so get the long-term reduced capital gains rate.
Unless the price had gone down when they received the gift (i.e. you can't pass over a loss) in which case they would instead use the fair market value and date of the gift.
You should also provide them with proof of the basis in case they are audited.
Say you bought that 1 BTC for $100 and you are giving 0.01 BTC to your friend (cost basis of $1). Say they sell it for $80 tomorrow. They will have 80 - 1 = 79 long-term capital gains to declare.
@_date: 2017-11-20 21:13:24
Which exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-30 15:54:27
You need to declare it as capital gains. Whether you pay tax or not depends on where you live and other circumstances. 
For instance, in the US, if you bought and sold within a year or less it would be taxed at your normal tax rate. If you owned the coins for more than a year, then it would be long-term tax rates, which could be 0%, 15% or 20%, depending on your other income.
@_date: 2017-11-27 05:18:34
That's because in a 1099B the broker know the cost basis. Coinbase don't know your basis so it would be impossible for them to calculate gains. They also don't know if you sell or transfer, and just put everything as a sell in their own tax report. It's nonsense.

Selling or spending Bitcoin (or any crypto-currency) is a tax event and (since it sounds like your are in the US) subject to capital gains.
Spending on purse is no different that spending your Bitcoins elsewhere, or even trading them for USD. You need to keep records of when you spent, how many coins, for what value in USD as well as what those coins cost you initially. The difference is your capital gain or loss.

Moving is expense. $10k-$20k for your shipping container alone. If you sell your house, that'll be taxed too.
It's going to take you a while to establish credit in your new country. Of course, depending on where you are going, you could well have higher income taxes (e.g. Europe) that will offset any reduced long-term capital gains taxes.


Unlikely that you will get it.
@_date: 2017-11-24 03:26:57
It depends if you actually had any gains. 
You are still supposed to report it in your 1040 Schedule D (assuming you are in US because you used $), but you would only have capital gains income if you made any profit.
But the amount of tax depends on the age and cost basis of the coins as well as your other income.

I'm not a certified public accountant, so unfortunately my opinion is pretty worthless. All I can say is that the accountants and a tax lawyer I have spoken with have told me they believe BCH would be treated as income. Whether it would be treated as a spin-off is beyond my knowledge.
The reason for income is that 1) the IRS considers new wealth taxable even if it were involuntary, and 2) BCH had a value before the fork.
You have to accept you have access to the BCH if you owned BTC.
However, is there an argument that there was no value? The reason this is worth questioning is that where it was valued was Bitfinex, which now doesn't allow US individual customers. So was there actually a bona fide market? What is the value if you can't actually obtain the value?


This, unfortunately, isn't a reason against it. It often happens in competitions, e.g. [Oprah's car giveaway]( where whilst receiving a car they also had a $7,000 tax bill that had to be paid. Sell the car or take the cash choice instead.
With BCH, if you sold it straightaway, you owe taxes on a portion since it was free money. If you sold at a loss, then you can claim the loss too to balance it out. If you are are still holding, sell what you need to to cover the original taxes.
Accountants will usually give you conservative advice. Perhaps get another opinion.

The 1099K has nothing to do with capitals gains or taxes. It's do with merchant's taking payment and receiving income.

Right now we don't support futures specifically, or future exchanges. I have started having conversations with the accountants about even how this should be handled. 


That, at least, can be done now. Importing any currency amount will get valued with daily average rates. For example, importing the daily gains into Income tab with just the date,coin,volume will add the appropriate price. I'm don't see how these could have zero basis.
The IRS are quite behind in their announcements, and perhaps thinking. Most accountants I have spoke with are erring on the side of caution. They believe you will be in a good position if you can show you made a reasonable attempt to calculate and pay what you owe.

Yes, you have capital gains tax. 
Let's say you bought 1 BTC for $100. Then it goes up to $1,000 and you sell 0.1 BTC receiving $100.
You received $100 for that 0.1 BTC that was originally worth $10, so $90 capital gains.
How much tax you pay depends on how long you held the BTC before selling and also what other income you have that year. It could be nothing, 0%, the long-term rate, 15%, or your normal income tax rate.
@_date: 2015-08-28 01:33:34


They aren't and they don't care. What they do care about is how much USD or equivalent income you make, and that you are declaring it. (income, I mean capital gains).
As far as we know, Bitcoin exchanges are not sending forms to the IRS, since there is no reporting mechanism in place, unlike stock brokers.
However, it would be prudent to pay the taxes you owe. If you were audited, for any reason, and it comes out that you intentionally withheld income you could incur fines and legal action.

Adjust which way? By default, they would be considered income to the value of *volume * price*. That also sets cost basis for when they are sold, which is when the CG kick in. It you used a zero price you will defer the income to CG income.

You mean from your previous house, then yes, it's exempt for most people.


They do. The IRS has clarified their position. It's property and subject to capital gains. You can't combine real property with other property.
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:00:32
It would be 15% of any profit you would make (what you would sell them for less what you bought them for) up to about $400k. After that it would be 20%.
@_date: 2017-11-22 07:49:23
If you are using the proceeds on your primary home to buy another home, there is no capital gains (up to a limit).
However, if you are exchanging real property for another non-like property - Bitcoin - you might not get to keep the capital gains benefit. So you'll just be paying tax for the sake of it. Go and check with a tax accountant.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:25:26
Gains are gains, and taxable no matter where they come from. It's just that when you get gains from selling your primary home you are allowed to keep it as long as you use the money to buy your next home, and it's no more than $250k ($500k for a couple) and you've live in the home for 2 of the last 5 years.
You will pay capital gains taxes if you sell BTC no matter what you are spending it on.

Gambling winnings are income in USD. So you'd have to convert your BTC winnings to USD to declare.
Gambling losses can offset winnings, but nothing else.
e.g. you stake 1 BTC and win 2 BTC. You have gambling winnings of 1 BTC at price that day (let's say $200). That $200 has to be declared and sets the cost basis for the new 1 BTC you own for when you sell it.
@_date: 2017-11-08 02:14:03


There really aren't. The IRS is pretty clear that Bitcoin and digital currencies are assets, so gains are liable for capital gains tax.
If exchanges report to the IRS then you will receive a form. AFAIK, none do, except Coinbase/BitPay for merchant services. That's not to say the information isn't shared for during fraud investigations.

You definitely ought to consider reporting it, since the loss can be used offset any other capital gains and then also income. Essentially a tax deduction.
You'll need to report the sales you made in 1040 Schedule D, with their original cost (i.e. date, value) and the sale proceeds. The difference is your gain or loss.
This might provide a bit more information:
Feel free to ask if you have other questions.

When an asset is disposed (sold, spent, exchanged for another asset), it's a tax event. Yes, that might well be a loss.


Nothing happened yet since you haven't realized any gains.


You could have suffered a casualty loss (not a capital loss) of the original cost basis, so $100. But this is an itemized deduction (Schedule A) and subject to limits [less the $100 rule and the 10% AGI rule]( i.e. nothing. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 16:44:30
The IRS says in their [2014-21 Q6]( that exchanging digital currency for other property is a tax event. They class digital currencies as property, so it's considered disposing of one property and acquiring another. Gains would need to be calculated.
However, you will hear some people and  accountants say it could be treated as a *like-kind* 8824 exchange. A real world example of like-kind is when a real estate company buys and sell land or property. They can claim is it an exchange and so transfer the cost basis. There are some rules, it must be for use in a trade or business, or for investment, and the two items must be similar. Two real estate properties in the 50 US states are similar, but one in the US and one in Europe is not. Likewise, two cars are similar, but a car and truck is not.
It's unlikely the IRS would allow alt-coins to be like-kind, since they are obviously different. Different code, different markets, different wallets. But the real answer is no one knows with absolute certainty. Get advice form your tax preparer, CPA or tax attorney.
@_date: 2016-02-24 03:11:17
You can be anonymous and still pay taxes. You can use cash and remain anonymous. You're referring to tax fraud. The great thing about the IRS, is they'll accept taxes even for illegal activities ;)
You don't have to declare what you used the Bitcoin for, any there isn't any link to your wallets or addresses (unless you add them). However, dropping $10k (for example) into a bank account from selling your coins is going to get someone's attention.
In the end, it's a person's choice whether they avoid taxes or not, be it Bitcoin, cash, gambling, foreign accounts, or anything else.
@_date: 2017-04-02 20:34:58
I normally say no effect, as it's like moving dollars between your checking and savings account, which has no tax implications. 
That is true for moving coins around.
However, you are technically spending a network fee, which could create gains. Fortunately, given the fee is usually small, the gains are also likely to be less than $0.50, so would round down to zero on any tax forms.

Sorry, mis-typed that. If you made more than $17,000 then it is pointless as your allowable loss would be reduced to zero. Anything below $17k would gradually allow more of your loss, e.g. $10k  income and you would be allowed $1700-100-1000 = $700.
@_date: 2017-04-02 05:30:33
It's obvious if someone looks into it.
@_date: 2017-04-29 15:00:44
You would have to file an amended tax return for 2014 and claim a [casualty loss]( Be aware you can only claim for the cost basis, not their market value.
However, casualty losses have to be quite high before they have any effect.  Essentially, your loss is reduced by $100 and then 10% of your AGI. So if you had more than $17,000 income that year, your loss is worthless.
edit: said less than $17k, meant more.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:52:23
I don't think anything will happen. You did the best you could do. 
All you could have done different is find the very first blockchain transaction's date and use the daily price that day. But you could still have show that was your very first transaction, which would be impossible without more information.
So what you've done is better (in the IRS's eyes) since you've taken the action they might if you couldn't prove the original basis, give it a zero cost basis. You also won't be able to claim long-term gains unless you can show you've owned for more than a year.

For US taxpayers: 
We also have a tax calculator and more info at 
tl:dr; If you sold or spent coins, it's capital gains (1040 Schedule D). If you mined coins, it's taxable income (1040 Line 21 or Schedule C). If you donated coins to a registered charity, you can claim the price that day and pass along long-term benefits.
edit: not sure if you edited your question, or it was just late and I just missed it!


You can declare capital losses the same way you would declare gains. Losses can be used to offset any gains you might have, and then they can be used as a deductible...but only up to $3,000 per tax year. Any remainer carries forward into future years. You report it all in Schedule D.

Unfortunately not, because the US has worldwide income taxes, You would still owe. Even if you tried to renounce your citizenship would get hit with an exit tax, which would tax all your assets as if they had been sold.
Best thing you can do is make sure you don't sell or dispose of any (e.g. trading altcoins) so you have reduced long-term capital gains rates. You can look at investing in [Qualified Opportunity Zones]( to defer gains and then plan for those long-term gains in 2026.

Otherwise, the cheapest I can see is TaxAct Plus, which includes 1040 and Schedule D, for $18.50.
The only other free option is by paper and mail it in. Most site like TurboTax, TaxACT, etc, give you a preview of the 1040 (only) fields at the end somewhere. You can use that to help fill in your form.
@_date: 2017-04-01 22:04:39
You don't have to worry about anything yet, but keep records of what you bought and for how much. When you come to sell or spend, you will have to calculate any potential capital gains that are reported on your 1040.
My advise would be to periodically download the "Buys, Sells and Merchant Activity" report in your Coinbase account. It includes the information about any buys and sells. Then you will always have a record in case anything unforeseen should happen.

It means you aren't charged VAT when buying, or trading, Bitcoin. Not that Bitcoin is somehow a magic form of payment that excludes VAT.
For instance, if you went to Bitstamp to buy 1 BTC when the price was €500, you only pay €500. If there had been VAT, you could have paid €500 + 20% VAT (or whatever country rate) = €600 for your 1 BTC. Had the VAT ruling been different, it would effectively put European exchanges at a disadvantage since they would be charging a 20% premium. Customers would go elsewhere.
However, when you spend your coins, nothing changes. The vendor will still charge you VAT if they are VAT registered. So if you buy a €100 widget, that's still €100 + VAT, no matter if you are paying by Bitcoin, cash, or card.
@_date: 2016-09-05 23:59:29
If you are a vendor in the EU, you will have to register for VAT if your gross sales are over a threshold in your own currency (e.g. UK is £83,000).
If you are VAT registered, any sale you make must add VAT at the appropriate rate to the price (as long as product is not exclusive of VAT).
So if you had been selling widgets for £100, and you become VAT registered, you'll now be selling them for £120. That £20 will be sent to the government (in your quarterly VAT return).
Bonus: when you purchase things from other businesses, you can either not pay VAT (if they work like that) or take any VAT you did pay from your own VAT sales. What you send to the government is your net VAT figure.
It doesn't matter what currency the customer pays with, your price is still the same. and includes VAT. So if you take Bitcoin as payment, you'll be charging £120 in BTC. If you only take enough BTC for £100, you've screwed yourself over as you still have to pay the £20 VAT.
If you don't make that much from your sales, then there is no need to register for VAT, and you won't add it on to the price when you charge your customers. You don't have to worry about VAT at all.


Doesn't matter


No, you pay your net VAT bill in your home currency, e.g. EUR or GBP.


If you are VAT registered, you are a VAT middleman for the government. You charge consumers VAT and pass it onto the government. You still pay corporation tax on your net income.


Your business is still registered in a country and you still file returns.

1. Yes, most likely. Some will tell you you could claim an 1031 "like-kind" exchange. This has never been approved by the IRS but the new 2018 tax laws explicitly do not allow it. If you do choose to do this for 2017, you should be aware of consequences, i.e. potential penalties, and also you still have to declare every deferral on an 8824. Speak to accountant for correct advice.
2. Yes, outside US. If you total sum of all foreign fiat balances was over $10k at any time during the year, you must file a FBAR. You will then need to declare all foreign account no matter their balance.

Your gain/loss is proceeds - cost. So, $1000 - $2000 = -$1000.

You could check with your accountant, but most probably will tell you that it wouldn't be allowed. In that case every time you disposed of an asset (your Bitcoin) whether for USD or any other asset you have to calculate gains on the fair market value.

You have sold. You were selling BUY and ETH when day trading. Each transaction should be reported with the gains/losses.
Each time you dispose of an asset, you have a tax event where you need to calculate the gains of its fair market value less the cost.
The only time you might not do that is 1) you were a registered trader (you received Tax Trader Status with IRS), 2) you elect each as a 1031 like-kind exchange. The latter is questionable although the iRS hasn't clarified (not allowed for 2018) but most accountants will likely tell you it wouldn't be accepted. You should speak to your tax professional.

You need to work out the gain (or loss) you made.
Essentially, the *n* BTC x $6,800 less the amount you paid for them, i.e. *n* x $6,500. This is your capital gains. Since it's in 2018, you will declare this next year (for the US, other countries may be different) as short-term income (if was a year or under).
You now also have *m* BTC @ $7200, the cost basis that you need to keep a record for when you sell, spend or trade those.
However, if you traded altcoins with this BTC during 2017/2018, those are also tax events as if you had sold your BTC, so you will need to report each one and the profit/loss and declare in the appropriate year.

No, you can ignore it. Just like moving dollars from your checking account to a savings account isn't "income".


Not normally. You don't pay gains on gifts. You can gift up to $14k per person per year (for 2017, $15k in 2018) without having to declare or pay the gift tax. You can also pass the cost basis over to the recipient, meaning they can take advantage of long-term gains. You can't pass over a loss, it would me minimum of fair market value. 
Of course, assuming it is a gift. A gift is where you have no expectation of anything in return. So you can't avoid taxes by "gifting" someone and they sell and "gift" it back. That's just tax evasion.

It isn't a split, it's just new income. It's value is the fair market value when it is created, so the question becomes how much it is worth.
If I created a fork, it has zero value since you can't gain from it, it has no value. But BCH, for example, there was an established market and so had a value at the time of the fork. You have also been able to sell those coins at any time from then till now (except where they are not available at exchange/wallets). 
If I dropped a bar of gold in your lap, you wouldn't claim you had no income until you sold it. The fact that gold has a price and could be sold is enough.
Zero-cost may seem "rational" to you because you don't want to pay income tax, but the IRS wants its share of that income.

Let's say you have a $1 bill.
Now you take a piece of plain paper and write $1 on it with the same serial number as your original dollar.
Your paper is obviously worthless. However, you find a place where they have been trading these pieces of paper with $1 written on them. Someone says to you, "hey, I'll give you $0.25 for your piece of paper dollar."
This is a simplistic analogy of a fork and futures market.
In Bitcoin terms someone duplicated the software with a small change and is running that version. They were the same up to the point in time of the change but now they are different. Because it's a duplicate, there is a copy of everything before the change. You still have the original but you can also use the copy in complete separation. You can trade the original, Bitcoin, and you can independently trade the new "Bitcoin".

First, be aware, you'll get differing opinions if a 1031 "like-kind" exchange is allowed for coin-coin trades in 2017 and earlier. It is definitely not in 2018 with the new tax code changes.
"Like-kind" would mean you are just transferring cost basis from one coin to another, so don't report gains. You are just deferring them, but still have to report this on a 8824 form.
Please speak to you tax professional on if you should do this, but most don't believe it would be allowed, or take a more conservative approach to not do this.
Otherwise, when trading alt coins you are effectively disposing of one asset to buy another. The value for which you "sell" the one coin would be fair market value. You can use your own valuation, as long as it is from a consistent source, e.g. bitcoinaverage.com
That disposition value is then used to set the cost base of the acquired coin. So, for example, say you bought 10 ETH for 1 BTC when BTC was trading at $5000, then you have a sale of 1 BTC @ $5000, and a purchase of 10 ETH @ $500. You would have to work out the potential gains/losses on that 1 BTC as if you had sold it for USD.
In your case, where you use 0.2 BTC when the price was $10k, then you "sold" those 0.2 BTC for $2000. You gain is 2000 - (0.2 * 6500) - &lt;any fees&gt; = $700.
You can work this out yourself if you handle few trades. Or do it in a spreadsheet. I also run  where you can import your trades and we do it for you.

Your details aren't very clear, but gambling income is reported as normal income in USD value.

Moving money around in chunks is called [*structuring*]( and no safer. 
You don't get taxed on what you invest, only on profits you make. If you buy Bitcoin for that 10k then sell them later for 15k, you have made 5k, which is taxable capital gains income. The tax rate depends on your other income and circumstances, but could be 0%,15%,20% or your standard tax rate.

The IRS preferred is first-in first-out, so it would be a gain of $4,500.
While you might do specific identification and choose your basis, you aren't allowed to do it just to reduce taxes. Also, if the coins are mixed into a single account or wallet then this is less likely to be accepted since you can't distinguish one's basis from another.
To do what you want you should keep two separate wallets and exchange accounts so they can never be mixed. Put your long term coins in one and short term in the other. You also spend from the short term wallet. That way you can safely show the other was for investment only and not used.

Not so much anymore.


That's just nonsense. You aren't being taxed on digital currency. You are being taxed on USD income. If you convert $1m worth of mined Bitcoin into USD, you have $1m taxable income. If you keep your Bitcoins, there is no income and so no taxes due.


Yes, see [IRS Notice 2014-21](
Essentially, gains realized when disposing assets are treated as capital gains income. And like all capital gains, the tax rate on that income depends on age of the asset and your other income. Worst case, it is taxed as ordinary income. Best case, it has a reduced (0%) tax rate.
That's not to say there aren't legal ways to reduce your tax burden.
@_date: 2015-09-19 20:24:24


Well, that depends. You would pay no tax on gains of transactions less that $200, but anything above would be taxed as income. Whereas long-term capital gains has a reduced tax rate of 15%/20%.
Spenders probably pay less. Investors probably pay more.
@_date: 2015-04-14 14:07:05
I doubt it. The primary reason is that you still have to pay owed taxes by April 15. Selling one or two days before isn't enough time to get the money out of the exchange and to the IRS.
Plus, I'd say the majority of Bitcoiners have a loss from 2014, so they would be getting refunds.

It is long-term capital gains, so at today's rate would be 15% up to your total income of $413k and 20% above that (single taxpayer).
Note, if you were a low income earner, your normal income plus your gains up to $36,900 would be taxed at 0%.
Of course, things may change in 10 years.
So, assuming single person in 2015, and let's say you had $50k other income (your salary).
(413,201 - 50,0000) -&gt; 363,201 * 0.15 = $54,480.15
(9,960,000 - 363,201) * 0.20 = $1,919,359.80

If you were doing this with intent to make profit, you should definitely look at filing as self-employed via Schedule C as a business rather than hobby. You will include your mining income and be able to deduct the expenses you incurred.
There are some caveats, in that the IRS could look (in an audit) and decide you were just a hobbyist, in which case deductions become limited. They have some general information on [hobby vs business]( income, or speak to a CPA.
Be aware, while you can deduct business expenses (h/w , power) you will also pay self-employment taxes on any income. 
BitcoinTaxes can do the importing of your data. If you used regular payout addresses, you can just include those and we'll pull down the incoming transactions from the blockchain. We'll drop them into your Income tab, along with their daily price. Or, if you have a spreadsheet, you can just import it in.
Likewise, you can import your Coinbase data in a few clicks for your buying and spending.
At the end we'll produce a capital gains report importable into TurboTax/TaxACT, as an attachable statement, or even creating a ready-to-print Form 8949 - all depending on how you are filing.
The income report will given your total mining income value along with a breakdown.

Moving money around is irrelevant as far as taxes goes. Your taxes are calculated at the time of the events, when you trade.
So you bought $10k worth BTC.


I assume you mean you traded it until you only had $1k left (rather than it just losing market value). All those trades are potential capital gains/losses and should be declared in each tax year.
You then buy and sell to make $9k worth BTC. Again, all those trades are tax events and the gains and losses have to be calculated and reported in that tax year.
Now you're back to $10k is irrelevant, it's how you got there. Depending on timing you might have $9k capital gains losses in the first year, but then made $9k gains in the second. You need to report the $9k loss, since it will reduce your tax burden that year. Now this year you will have $9k gains to pay taxes on.
tldr; it could come out as net zero over a few years (depending on other circumstances) but you still need to report each year's activities and pay taxes

You could trade as long as you have owned them for more than a year.
However, while that amount of gains might not be taxable because it is 0% rate, you are now creating income. When you go above $37,950 in capital gains income, you also move to the next tax bracket and so also will begin to incur 15% long-term capital gains.
Still a very good way to legally extract profits tax free.

Yes. If you don't have many shorts, you can exclude them after the main Bitfinex import and then calculate them separately (change the coin to SHORTBTC or something). Or just make sure the shorts are placed after the closing buys, otherwise you'll get a negative balance and that's what creates an incorrect coin total.
This issue is Bitfinex API and CSV file exports don't consolidate correctly. I have done it by hand for a few people, but only because they don't have many, but it hopefully has given me the method to interpret the Bitfinex CSV files to automate it.

Download your LBC history, keep any statements from your bank if you did a transfer.
If you were audited, the burden is on you to prove your position. Say you were claiming long-term gain rates, you might need to show that you had owned the coins for more than a year. So use the above, for example, or any documentation you would have to support your case.
If you have nothing, worst case, the IRS might reject your long-term status and cost basis and instead treat it as short-term as 100% gains.
@_date: 2015-03-14 22:41:05
Depends on your circumstances on how you mined, as a business (or self-employed) or just for personal use, and if it was for-profit. As a business you can deduct hardware, generally in the year it was put into service. As an individual you are limited to the kinds and value of things you can deduct, since that hardware may not have been used 100% for the mining. If you have substantial costs, I would suggest talking to a CPA.
FIFO is safest and most prudent since it is the IRS's default. But there has been no guidance one way or the other, so there is nothing preventing you from doing specific identification, e.g. FIFO or others. However, if the IRS decides in the future to clarify only FIFO, you many need to re-file if you didn't use it.

Under audit you would likely have to show your original cost basis if you are claiming long-term gains.
We don't know if the IRS would accept blockchain as proof, but given your scenario of mixing, that would become less likely.
You could be good if you have the original records from the purchase of 50 BTC for the price and they don't see anything that suggest you had already spent them.
But if you don't have any proof or your original purchase (date or price), the IRS might not accept your long-term deduction and you will pay short-term gains on the full amount, i.e it is treated as if you just have $2.5m income that year.
@_date: 2017-05-17 00:53:24
That's right.
You are receiving property in payment for a product/service, so declare it as income at the fair market value.
At that point it's an asset you own with that income value above as its cost basis. When you sell (or spend), you are disposing those assets for another value. This is capital gains/losses. For an individual, you would declare them in Schedule D of your 1040.
If you owned those Bitcoins for more than a year you could take advantage of "long-term" rates, which could be 0%, 15% or 20% depending on your other income.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:01:19
You edited your question. 
You can use TurboTax, TaxACT, or any other filing software. Bitcoin gains are reported as capital gains in Schedule D.


If you held the coins you sold for over a year, it will be long term gains. Tax rate is either 0% or 15% depending on your other income and the amount of gains. Tax software will work this out.
If it was a year or less (or some where), those will be short-term gains, which are just taxed like normal income. i.e. add the $25k onto your taxable income amount. Normal tax brackets will apply.

Assuming you are referring to USD, then in the US profits from trading/spending are capital gains. You have $25k capital gains to report for 2015 when you file your taxes next April.
Since you held the coins for more than a year, it will be long-term capital gains, which has a better rate. The rate depends on your other income. It will start at 0% if your taxable income is the lower two brackets (less that $37,451), be 15% for all but the top bracket, which is 20%.
So, say if you had a $50k job, then you will be paying 15% tax on that $25k.

Whenever you sell or spend a coin, you take the oldest coin you own and use its cost basis.
e.g. Say you bought 1 BTC @ $100 then 2 BTC @ $200. Now you sell 1 BTC for $300. With FIFO you take the first coin's basis of $100, so your gain is $300 - $100 = $200. With LIFO, you'd take the newest, so $300 - $200 = $100.
What happens if you sold 2 BTC? You split it into 1 and 1 so ($300 - $100) + ($300 - $200) = $300.
And what about selling 0.5 BTC? Your gain is ($150 - $50) = $100, and you have to reduce your original 1 BTC @ $100 as now only 0.5 BTC @ $100.
This is easy with round numbers, but in reality it doesn't work like that and you have to keep track of the cost basis for all the coins and part-coins you own. It gets complicated and very difficult to track without a good spreadsheet or software. One of the reasons I created  in the first place.
I wrote a post about how and the [complications in calculating capital gains]( if you want to read more.
@_date: 2017-05-26 06:48:09


That's wrong too. Any disposition of assets (i.e. the digital currencies) would be a tax event to the fair market value of the goods you purchased. The transaction would be included in your Schedule D.

Any coins you mined are treated as immediate income by the IRS.
This is the USD value of what you mined (e.g. amount * the daily price) on the date your received it.
It doesn't matter if you keep the coins or sell them, you still have that income to report. e.g. 1040 Line 21 if it was just hobby income.
That income amount also sets the Bitcoin cost basis. So when you come to sell/spend, you'll take that from the amount of USD (or equivalent) that you receive, your capital gains/losses. Those are reported in 1040 Schedule D.
@_date: 2017-05-17 04:54:47
Yes, you (probably) do have capital gains/losses, and so could have taxes. You're disposing of one property, creating wealth, and using it to buy another. 
What you are suggesting otherwise is an 8824 like-kind exchange, for example, used with real-estate or vehicles. However, there are strict rules about what, and under what circumstances, property can be exchanged.
I said "probably" above because the IRS hasn't formally clarified its position, but it wouldn't meet the likeness tests. A Bitcoin isn't like a Litecoin, for instance, in the same way a truck isn't like a car - a pair that is not accepted by the IRS.
@_date: 2017-05-27 18:42:19
The onus is always on you to keep accurate records.
With mining, you ought to be declaring the income when you received it. It you didn't keep exact records you could estimate it. If you can't, you could perhaps treat it as zero-cost short-term gains when you sell them, since that would generate the same amount of tax revenue. Speak to your accountant for proper advice.

BCH coins can be treated as income with zero basis. When you sell, you will have 100% gains on them.
BTC has no effect on BCH. BCH prices will be determined by the market over the coming weeks.

The cost basis can be transferred along with a gift, the carryover basis, which is the lesser of the original basis and the market value. So, if A had bought at $200 and B sold at $400, B would have $200 capital gains.
However, in your example, if A doesn't/can't tell B the basis (even the date they were purchased - where B could then find a daily price, or they could even deduce it) then B will just have to 1) estimate the basis, or 2) assume a zero cost.

PMd you.
@_date: 2015-10-22 02:58:18
Depends where you live.
In the US, for example, the IRS has declared virtual currencies as capital assets, so all Bitcoin trades or spending is a tax event, and you have to work out any potential capital gains.
So whenever you sell Bitcoin, you need to take the difference of the money you made less the value of the coins when you bought them. This is your profit (or loss). 
Any profits are taxed as capital gains. This is long-term gains if you held the coins for more than a year, at a rate of 0% - 20% depending on your other income. Or, short-term, a year or less, where it is just taxed as income.
Tumbling makes no difference. If you are doing it to not pay taxes, it's just tax fraud.
If you buy something with Bitcoin, for taxes, it's treated no different than if you sold those coins for USD. You still could owe capital gains taxes.
See  for more information.
@_date: 2016-05-20 01:33:57
A gives B a gift. No taxes unless it is above A's gift allowance, where they would pay gift taxes.
B gets the coins at their original cost basis (if know). When selling, any gains are taxable capital gains.
B can transfer a gift back to A, same gift tax rules apply.
e.g. A buys 1 BTC for $200. A gives it to B. B sells it for $400. B has ($400-$200)=$200 taxable capital gains income (say 25% tax or $50). B gives the $400 to A, but B still owes the $50 tax. A has no taxes.
This assumed short-term capital gains. Rates would be less if long-term.
This is a common way to reduce taxes, because if you gift capital assets to someone in a lower tax bracket, they pay less taxes.  If A and B are in the same tax bracket, there is no benefit.
For example, say I am in a higher tax bracket and I want to give my lower-income relative a gift. I could give them the 1 BTC that I paid $200, they can sell it for $400. Since they are in a low-tax bracket , they'd pay less taxes on the gains. If it was also long-term capital gains, they wouldn't pay any tax. We both win.
@_date: 2017-05-12 21:41:27

Because of that, there is no easy answer. You can find the short orders in one of their files, but it does not map with the actual executed partial trades. This is the problem. I am putting in a temporary solution to do the best to identify the shorts, but it will not be exact until Bitfinex fix their side.

You any pay taxes when you make income, and holding onto any virtual currency isn't income until you sell or spend it. 
At that point you will need to calculate your gain, the difference what you made and what they cost you. That is capital gains, and taxed at your normal tax rate if you owned them for a year or less, or at a discounted rate (0%, 15% or 20%) if you owned them for more than a year.
Only gains you made are taxed, not the Bitcoins themselves or the cost you put into it. Also be aware, spending is treated like selling.
The IRS don't know or care until you profit from disposing of your coins. So until then, keep records of your purchases so you can prove your cost basis for when you do sell.

@_date: 2015-10-24 18:10:59
This has nothing to do with capital gains, which vary by country, and most still apply to Bitcoin. This is the equivalent of sales tax, called value-added-tax (VAT).
When you buy most products in Europe, you are also charged a sales tax, VAT. The question has been, should Bitcoin be subject to this VAT. i.e. if you bought 1 BTC at €200, would you actually pay €240. (20% VAT).
It is similar to gift cards. You wouldn't go into a store and buy a €100 gift card but pay €120. Because, the user of the gift card would also pay VAT on whatever they purchased. You would effectively be paying VAT twice. So gift cards are exempt. Now Bitcoin is too.
@_date: 2015-11-07 17:28:04
Not how taxes work. That would only work if you bought and sold everything in the same tax year. Otherwise the cost basis and gains are going to be split and worked out over multiple years.
Withdrawing large sums, even over time, could flag your account for review (over time is called structuring). Depends on the bank.

You could only claim it as an deductible expense in the year you bought the card if you file as self-employed. You'll also pay self-employment taxes on anything you own.
However, if it's more hobby income (not a business) then you can only include hobby expenses in your itemized deductions (Schedule A) and only to the amount of hobby income.

It doesn't really matter if it looks like one, it isn't one. You don't need to report it.
If, in the very unlikely event, this were questioned, you could show you owned both addresses so it was just a transfer of property to yourself.
A recent discussion I had with a tax attorney on the Coinbase/IRS issue was that they are likely going after the low hanging fruit. Those users that didn't file capital gains yet had Coinbase accounts. A letter sent out to those users reminding them they need to pay taxes. This will likely bring in a large part of the owed taxes. The IRS simply doesn't have the resources to investigate everyone.
@_date: 2015-03-14 01:58:26
Yes, you're quite right, hence the vague answer. Even through rules do differ from country to country, most do have capital gains taxes when selling and only a few Coinbase supported countries have a net worth tax.

Bitcoin is just property and so taxed as a capital asset.

No problem. Ask or PM if you have any specifics on how to do things.
Generally (because you should get proper advice), your company receiving donations is income if you provided a service in return. Funding, a business expense. Paid for advertising is income, so work out the USD. Paying for advertising is a business expense, in USD, as well as a BTC capital gains tax event.
For personal, receiving prizes is taxable income (you should get a 1099-MISC if over $600). Paying people might be deductible as part of hobby expenses, but only if you choose to itemize deductions on Schedule A (unless you are self-employed) - limits apply. Buying stuff was a tax event, work out capital gains. Getting paid is "other" income in USD.

There is already capital gains on Bitcoin and all virtual currencies. If you sell/spend them and make a profit, you owe taxes on those profits. Just holding onto them has no tax consequences.
@_date: 2015-10-16 23:37:26
Bitcoin, and all virtual currencies, are capital property in the eyes of the IRS, so you file capital gains.
S1: You typically use *first-in first-out*, where you would take the cost basis of the first coin you owned to work out the gains. e.g . 300 - (0.75 * 500) = -75 (loss)
This is the default and preferred IRS method, but you could use different cost basis methods, such as *last-in first-out* (or any other specific identification method). However, you should use it consistently and the IRS might question if you are switch purely to avoid taxes.
S2: Every trade is a tax event, so you would work out the gains/losses for each one.
S3: Cost basis of your 2 BTC is the fair value of those cards you sold, which is around $200 in total. So when you sell both for $500, you made $300 gains.
S4: You earned normal income of the fair value of your work, or the daily average price of 1 BTC. This will have income tax. When you sell, the price of the watch less the above is your capital gain.
S5: Back in the day, those coins had zero value. The capital gain is whatever he sold them for. Fortunately it's been long enough that it will be long-term gains, with a reduced tax rate.
You can use  to help you work it all out.

I'm sure someone will mention Libra as an alternative, but I would add a word of caution that it fails my test data and produces different results.
Some of the reasons: they do not (always) use the actual price data and instead replace with a market price, so your buying and selling figures aren't correct. They don't account for fees, so you have more gains that you should. They just silently ignore altcoin trades or replace them with BTC trades. There are more inconsistencies that cause different results in their importers, but these ones have the biggest impact.
It takes a lot of effort to get the imported data right in Libra. You have to manipulate and correct it. I'm glad to say once you've done that, both systems give the same answer.
Also be aware their final report has rounding errors in it, so sometimes the proceeds - cost != gain. If you've used them you might want to double-check your figures.
My advice actually would be to use Excel to check manually.

Right now your post is misleading and giving incorrect information.
edit: I'll add that treating as currency has a downside, in that personal losses are not deductible. This means anyone who bought Bitcoin, say, at $800 in 2013 and sold for $300 in 2014 could not claim those losses, which you could if they were capital assets.

[BitcoinTaxes]( should do want you want. We've been running and processing Bitcoin tax capital gains since Feb last year.
As well as importing trading history from most exchanges, we also include spending from wallets like the core wallet, Coinbase and Blockchain.Info. You can also import any income from mining.
We'll pull in all the transactions, look up the daily price, and show you the list you can check over. This is for Bitcoin and most other alt-coins.
We'll automatically ignore any transfers between wallets, as long as we know all the addresses, but you can always manually remove any others.
You can also go through and correct any dollar amount as needed. Say you bought something for $20, but the exchange rate that day made it come out as $21. You can simply adjust it.
At the end we'll calculate all your income and capital gains income, and let you export your data into your tax forms, TurboTax or TaxACT.

If you received something for your BTC, i.e. sold BTC for USD or bought something, then it's a tax event and will go in Schedule D Form 8949 as capital gains. You enter the proceeds (or value of what you bought), coin volume, their original price and dates. 
If you gifted there is no tax burden on you (unless it was over $14k). But you will need to remove those coins from your costs basis. e.g. say you bought 1 BTC @ $100 and another 1 BTC  then gave one way, you are left with 1 BTC @ 200. (This is FIFO, the default cost basis method).
If you donated to a registered (it must be registered and you need a receipt) charity *and* you had owned those coins for more than a year, you get more tax breaks because you deduct those contributions at the price when you donated. e.g. you bought 1 BTC @ $10 over a year ago and donated it to Red Cross when BTC was worth $500, you have no tax liability but can include $500 charitable donations on your tax forms.

@_date: 2017-07-25 15:42:12
If you can find the date you could use the daily price. Otherwise, using $0 would certainly be safer.
However, another reason you want to have records showing a past date is so you can claim long-term gains. Otherwise, in the unlikely event of an audit, you the IRS might not accept it. No one really know what they would accept yet, but showing the address blockchain transactions would be the minimum.
If you are asking, just use FIFO. FIFO is the IRS preferred method and you can't go wrong with it. If you were choosing another method, it can't just be to avoid taxes.
@_date: 2017-05-03 17:06:03
Depends where you live. Most places don't require you to report your Bitcoin value, but are report any profit made.
In the US for instance, you have to declare any capital gains (and losses) when you dispose of any digital currencies. This means whenever you sell, spend, or trade them (for example, buying another coin ABC with BTC).
Profits are capital gains, and those along with losses are summed over the tax year and reported in your tax return. Tax rates depends on your other income and how long you held the digital currencies.
You don't need to declare any holdings, but do keep records of when you bought, traded, spent anything.

All trades of property would be tax events and they would likely not get "like-kind" treatment. Of course, this is not absolute, since the IRS has not clarified one way or the other, but it is the most probable and certainly prudent approach.
This means when you buy *m* XYZ for *n* BTC, you are in effect selling *n* BTC for USD, and then using that USD to buy your XYZ. The selling of the BTC requires you to calculate any potential gains/losses. The USD is then used to set the new cost basis on XYZ.
You would use the fair value of BTC, either the price on the exchange you are trading, or the daily BTC price - just use the prices from the same consistent source.
You can report losses just as you would report gains, no matter if selling for USD or trading alt-coins.

There is no threshold, everything is supposed to be included. With the exception that gains are rounded so gains less than $0.50 would be zero.

@_date: 2015-02-28 17:47:05
Mined coins are income when they are received, at their *fair value*, which is the average daily price. You can use any consistent source for that, as long as you stick to it, e.g. bitcoinaverage, bitstamp, etc.
It depends if you mined as a business, self-employed or hobby, where you add income into your tax form. i.e. self-employed would be Schedule C, hobby income would be 1040 Line 21.
You can deduct expenses (hardware/power) if you are a business or self-employed as part of your normal business expenses. It's a bit more limited for hobby income, since you need to do it by taking itemized deductions, no more than the hobby income itself, and limited by 2% AGI.
That's income, now the capital gains.
The cost basis of those coins is the same as the income you reported. So when you sell each coin you need to get the difference between what you made, less that cost basis, less fees. e.g. say you mined 1 BTC on 01/01/2014, it was worth $772. If you sold it on 01/05 for $985 on Coinbase (1% fee), you made $203.15 capital gains.
Spending is treated no differently than selling, so you need to work out the gains (or losses) from disposing of these Bitcoins, except the proceeds value is the value of what you bought. e.g you bought a $100 gift card for *x* Bitcoin - then you "sold" *x* BTC for $100.

I don't imagine it'll be any different than the ETH/ETC split.


They would say that because it is true.
However, it's more complicated, because you might not have control over the new coin, say if, you don't have a client. So the question is what is the new coin's cost basis? Make it zero, which means you have zero income. But if you sell it, it will be 100% capital gains. That way you'll pay the correct taxes on the income you've received from the fork.
@_date: 2015-03-25 00:29:13

Let's assume you are in the US and talking about long-term capital gains, because if not, it's just income and not much you can do.
- Gift it and spread the coins to a low-income family members. They'll pay 0% capital gains taxes.
- If you already donate to charity, use your coins instead. You'll be able to deduct the full value and the charity can have the long-term benefit.
- If you have other capital losses not yet realized, do it in the same tax year so you can offset your gains.
- Die. Bit extreme, I know, but the cost basis will be on the date of death for the inheritance, which could be higher and so less taxes.

It is possible that last year was partly affected by people selling BTC in order to pay off tax from generated capital gains.
However, there was also a lot of other things going on Q1 last year (e.g. Gox, China) and I wouldn't put the number of users that actually filed gains on their taxes anywhere near 100%.
This year, anyone who wanted to generated loss sales has already done so (before Dec 31st), and there will probably be more losses filed than gains. But the amount of losses are capped so there really isn't going to be a massive tax refunds flowing out. Plus, if you do have a massive tax refund, you just payed too much tax in the previous year and should work out your withholdings or estimated payments better.
My personal opinion is that the price will continue to slowly drop throughout the year since they buyers are gone for the time being. It needs a rest before the next bubble, if there is one.

The worst case is if you were audited and ruled against (or they clarify in the future and you file an amendment) then you will owe back taxes. This could incur interest (0.5% per month) and possibly a penalty. If you were knowingly withholding, there could be civil penalties.
In order to calculate tax liabilities correctly, we do obviously need all the information, including the cost basis of the BTC you own. But that can be imported in from exchange data, or even entered manually. You are going to need to know this anyway even, if you went the like-kind treatment, for when you eventually sell to USD. I've personally done alt-coin trading (one of the reasons for the site in the first place) and once the trading data is imported, it only takes seconds to work out. Of course, it took me weeks to write the calculation engine in the first place!

Yes, every coin trade is a tax event since they are all classified as property. 
I wrote some info about how capital gains works here: 
But if you buy coins and then sell them all within the same tax year, you can simply take the money out less the money in. It just works out the same.
However, if you've owned the coins for longer than a year, had some to start, mined, spent any, or have some left over, things gets more complicated. You then need to track the cost basis of coins as you go.
For instance, say you bought 10 Bitcoins, traded for alts, traded back to Bitcoin, sold 5 of those coins. How much did those 5 cost vs. the 5 you are holding on to?

Generally, if you have received Bitcoin as payment, then it is income and you must convert it USD on paper for income reporting. Which daily rate you use is really up to you, as long as you use it consistently. So bitcoinaverage.com or bitstamp's daily price. There are plenty of sources that can give you your daily price.
Receiving Bitcoin as income also sets the cost basis of those coins for when you do sell them, for capital gains, so you need to keep that information.
Spending Bitcoin is treated no different than selling Bitcoin, from a tax perspective, you just use the fair value. So if your bought something from overstock worth $100 for x BTC, treat it as selling x BTC for $100, and calculate gains.

You need to be aware of the difference between a sole-proprietor, LLC, and a C corp.
A C corp is its own business entity and employs you, whereas with self-employed (e.g. an LLC) you are the business. C corps benefit from corporation taxes but a lot more paperwork and costs up front. Self-employed is less effort and you can still write a lot of your own business costs, but you pay self-employment taxes.
You business basically deducts any operating expenses. I don't know what you do, but say you write articles, then you can deduct your home office, computer equipment, software, etc.

Bitcoin isn't cash, it is taxed as personal property and so follows other similar capital gains rules. Per the [IRS rules clarified in 2014]( all Bitcoin (and any digital currency) transactions are tax events, must be reported, and could incur capital gains. 
If Coinbase are sending information to the IRS, you would also receive a copy of the tax form, e.g. a 1099-MISC, 1099-K.
You are therefore required to report your own income and taxes. Each time you spend BTC, you need to calculate the gains. These are reported in Schedule D. You should also include any losses, as they can offset other gains and help reduce your overall taxes.
In reality, small transactions may have a small gain, and anything less that $0.50 is going to get rounded down to zero on your tax forms. So you may not have that much, especially if you are "selling" and buying at similar prices. But you do still need to work it out.

If you are employed, your employer will put the USD value on your W2 anyway.
If you are self-employed, or running a business, you need to find the fair value of those coins and report that income in USD.
Otherwise, doesn't sound like this is "hobby" income, so you are likely just self-employed.
If you are just being remunerated in BTC but for a USD amount (e.g. a job normally $1,000) then your income is as if you had received $1,000. You report that.
If you are paid in BTC with no USD value, then you need to convert it to USD using the daily price and report that. e.g. paid 5 BTC today, bitcoinaverage.com is $227, income is $1,135. You report that as your income.
These USD values will be put on your tax forms as income, and you'll pay income taxes as normal.
If you are self-employed you'll add it into Schedule C. You will pay self-employment taxes on that amount but you can also deduct business expenses.

You're getting in to tax planning and advice that you really should speak to someone about. They attorney I linked above is known here on reddit, very knowledgeable, and offers a consultant. Perhaps worth a phone call.
My comment was suggesting that if the IRS believe you were committing tax fraud as opposed to making a mistake, they might treat it differently. I don't believe there are red flags for losses, however, we really don't know if they are doing any kind of checking for virtual currency activity from 2013 or 2014. They are probably more interested in unfiled gains from 2013 than limited losses in 2014.

I was talking about LibraTax.
Closing values can be slightly out if all data isn't included. Some exchanges charge withdrawal fees (e.g. BTC-e) but aren't reported anywhere, as well as network transaction fees. For example, you transfer 1 BTC from BTC-e to your wallet then to Coinbase, you're only going to have about 0.988 left. These are just difficult to track and you would have to enter fees in order to account for them. 
Bitfinex also dropped all the fee information out of their API from before July.
Send a support ticket if you want me to look more closely at your account.

Sounds like  you are keeping all the correct information, so it's just a matter of working out the gain or loss for each sale you made.
You can do this yourself, using Excel. For each sale you need to know the cost basis of the coins you are selling from the ones you own.
If you have lots or differing volume it can become burdensome to work out which coin has which basis, which is why I created  last year to work out my own taxes.
It's necessary in that if you've you made a profit, you need to report this as capital gains income in Schedule D of your 1040.

No, you cannot claim anything.
If they had been stolen you could try and claim a casualty loss, but there are restrictions to the amount you can claim.

Sign up with Coinbase or Bitpay as a merchant, and have it set to convert to 100% dollars. There are no fees, which is great. That's your income sorted, as you'll receive the exact amount of USD you billed into your bank account (plus your accountant will appreciated it come tax time).
If you want to buy Bitcoins, buy them afterwards. This way you can clearly distinguish between your income and buying investments, for which you'll have to track costs basis and capital gains.

You are effectively selling to USD, or to the fair market value of whatever you are buying. If you buy a $100 gift card with Bitcoin, consider it like selling that Bitcoin for $100 and calculate capital gains appropriately.

The default is FIFO. That's the preferred way of the IRS. You can't go wrong with that.
If you chose to use another method, you should use it consistently. You cannot use it, or switch, purely to avoid taxes.

No, it isn't income.
It is, however, a tax event and potential capital gains income. Meaning you need to check if you have made any profit. You basically sold some BTC that you previously bought for a value. If you bought 1 BTC @ $1000 and spent 1 BTC on your debit card to buy something worth $3,000, then you have $2,000 capital gains income. How much tax capital gains tax you pay depends on your own circumstances and how long you owned that Bitcoin. It could be between zero and your standard tax rate.
However, if you are spending 1 BTC you recently acquired for $2,400 and buying something worth $2,400, then there is no gain, so no tax.


In this example they are pretty clear. Read [IRS 2014-21](

Hopefully this'll start you off.


You have capital gains, that you'll enter in 1040 Schedule D.


It's self reporting, an honor system. But if you got audited you could have to prove they were long-term.


It's just property.

I search for tax questions now and again, although not the busy season right now :)

"could not pay it" isn't the same as owing. There is still income that is taxable. They would need better tax planning.

But you did. You created $1m worth of Bitcoin.
Mining is income and reported in the year that they were mined. The amount is the number x their fair market value, e.g. the daily price.

Gains (and so taxes) are declared in April of the following year, so assuming your cash-out was recent, you have a while to include it.
The tax law is quite clear, all capital gains are reportable. You will include that transaction in Schedule D of your 1040.
However, the amount of tax you'll end up paying will depend on your other circumstances. It could even be nothing, but at the most it'll be taxed as regular income, whatever your rate.
