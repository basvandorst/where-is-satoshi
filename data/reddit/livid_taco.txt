The world is closing in
Did you ever think
That we could be so close, like brothers
The future's in the air
I can feel it everywhere
Blowing with the wind of change

I got some questions:
1. Does the network rely on people mining (in the bitcoin sense)?
2. Can I participate just by offering availability of storage space in exchange for availability of storage space for the times I am not available?
3. What incentive is there for people to mine? What incentive is for people to offer storage space availability?
4. Is there a way to purchase an exact level of redundancy and availability? Are these purchase abstract (details worked out by the network) or negotiated by individual network participants (possible automation built over that as voluntary add-ons)?
