That's a valid point, let me see about getting that changed.  Having the public key for reference is definitely a good idea.  As for discounts... we might be able to swing something. :)

typo fixed.

Just an update.  We've processed a handful of orders since posting this yesterday.  Thanks for your support everyone!
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:59:50
It happens. We are currently rebuilding our order page to accommodate different order sizes.  The $99 for 10 cards option will remain but other quantities +shipping are being added.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:41:10
haha deal!  Did you get your question answered?  For reference, this is one option.
1. bitaddress.org
2. generate an address
3. click the paper wallet tab
4. check the encrypt bip38 box
5. enter a good strong passphrase
6. click generate
Even better would be generating these offline!!

We're just about to change the dollar amount and card quantity to make it easier for more people to place orders.  We realized that not too many people need 10 of these.  Stay tuned!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:33:36
Who said we wouldn't provide our physical address?  Apparently you have been jaded by the untrustworthy.
Our legal corporate address is as follows:
Streamfly Media Inc.
1830 NW Riverscape St
Portland, OR 97209

Link updated and the graphic is being replaced in just a few moments.  Thanks for the heads up!
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:49:47
@_date: 2013-12-18 02:37:07
We might be able to arrange something.  Shoot us an email at hello before placing your order.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:31:33
Yep we registered our domain and joined reddit today.  I did see that other post yesterday or the day before but no, it was not the reason.  This has been on my back burner for several months.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:23:41
There is a margin yes but surprisingly with the material cost &amp; production, it's not huge.  Enough though! :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:26:31
hah thanks! done.
@_date: 2013-12-18 06:29:22
We've changed the dollar amount and card quantity to reflect several requests for a less expensive solution.  Hope this helps!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:27:39
There were none.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:41:27
I think you are exactly right about ceramics being a tad too brittle for long term storage.  Yes, stainless does melt but that's why you have a few in different places with the same address.  Hopefully all of the places you've kept your wallets don't burn at the same time!

New photography and a video is in the works.  The ones pictured are mockups and not as pretty as the finished products.  Keep you eye on our website for the changes.  PS... they are definitely the size of credit cards!
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:54:15
Either way.  All five can have the same, two can have the same, or they can all be different.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:24:15
Sick is slang for great or wonderful! :)
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:55:26
Thanks DanSantos!  Can we quote you on that? haha :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:39:49
It will take a little more time for production but we can do this.  Our shipping lead time of up to 10 days will still be relevant.  Thanks again for your feedback!
@_date: 2013-12-18 04:41:14
I will clarify to say engraving.  Etching is a term that most people understand.  We are not 'marking' metal similar to what you might find on a tool.  Once our new photography is available, it will how how deep the engraving is on our cards.  Sorry for any confusion.

Clicking on the 'Pay With Bitcoin' button will bring up the dynamic price in btc.  With the ever changing price of btc, we set the price in USD.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:12:01
DIY projects are awesome and the creativity people possess is endless.  I think it would be great to see something like that.  However, we've created our wallets for everyone else.  The ones who aren't the DIY type.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:58:41
For now yes, 10 packs only.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:43:02
We can actually print the QR code and text string for anything.  I'll research this and add some changes the website accordingly.  Thanks for your information!  It's people like you who help us all learn!
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:19:16
We've set the price in USD, however clicking on the 'pay with bitcoin' button will bring up the price in btc.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:25:41
We killed the project.  There were a handful on the table and ColdCoins stuck with us.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:12:49
Thanks zoiks1!!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:38
Awesome, thanks stop_runs!
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:37:47
Great! Thank you!
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:30:32
Yes indeed!
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:24:42
To everyone who has placed an order within the past few hours.  We had a slight integration issue with Coinbase but have fixed the problem.  Please send an email to hello if you weren't redirected to our order page and we'll take care of you.  Thanks again everyone for your support and orders!
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:21:36
We are a new company located in Portland, OR USA.  You can contact us via the support tab on our website. Streamfly Media Inc is the legal name of our company.  Being that we just launched our site today, I doubt search engines would have anything available to show you.
@_date: 2013-12-17 22:43:04
Awesome, thanks for your input!  I'll take the points you've mentioned and see if there are some changes to be made to satisfy you.
@_date: 2013-12-18 00:57:03
Thanks! As soon as our first batch is finished up, we plan to do a video and have some great photography done.
@_date: 2013-12-17 21:58:12
Thanks for the compliment! We look forward to your order. :)
@_date: 2013-12-18 03:43:33
For larger orders, yes we could most likely do something like that for you.  Shoot an email to us at hello
