i m just an external contractor, I m not mtgox and not even an employee and not even in japan, i have no insider infos about that, saying I have no idea is not admitting anything, just that _I_ have no idea

sure, those are concerns, but not the  reason for creating bitcoin imo, if you believe the genesis bloc, once again the genesis block says :
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:33:17
 that is called irony ;)
 one more way to say "i have no idea" , nothing like "I confirm"
and yes thats also why I intentionaly used a number &gt; 21M
 but it seems those redditors are not  able to understand the meaning of words, they just need to understand what they want and manipulate the price.
 for them "I have no idea" means "I confirm"

to me its more about fairness and morality ( against banksters and corrupted politicians ) than just security
@_date: 2014-11-23 00:50:39
also it seems they will be in the bitcoin blackfriday !
more infos on what is the grsec kernel : 
see also 
( another point of comparison is that grsec have not been written by the nsa :p )
believe me, any bitcoin business need it ! 
"The service has a specific purpose - you keep whatever distro you're using already, with a drop-in replacement kernel"
"As for price, it's geared toward individual users. It's $15 per kernel, but you can buy an upgrade plan that brings it down to $10"
"The main goal is to make it accessible to more people -- I don't expect to recoup the hardware costs alone for at least a year"
 lets hope we ll get a 0.03 BTC offer for the bitcoin black friday !

"Liberty, Security, and Privacy are the motivations behind bitcoin"
i m not so sure about that
the genesis block says 
"The Times 03/Jan/2009 Chancellor on brink of second bailout for banks"
that is the number one motivation for bitcoin, and its not about "Liberty, Security, and Privacy" , its about a corrupted economic system
see 
"Liberty, Security, and Privacy" are concerns, but not the  reason
( i m ok with the remaining of your post but i still think the real satoshi could be  )

 Just a sidenote, there is no IBSE yet, the IBSE is just an idea and an irc channel to talk of it and find partners.
 Yes this jsonbourne wanted to be part of the project, and joined the channel , but associating the IBSE idea to him is really not fair

yes its been intermittently down for 2 days now, and when the webpage load,the transaction data is outdated.
 more exactly  is down, the bitcoin blockchain is still ok ;)
@_date: 2012-09-13 19:06:56
 There are many alternatives / forks of bitcoin, in my opinion the most serious / long lasting / worth your interest is namecoin :
namecoin : 
exchange : 
historical graphs : 
 most of them disappear with time, or are just made by someone to make money with premining. bitcoin and namecoin are probably the only 2 long lasting ones.

 Good relation with your bank , ok, but do they know ( your bank ) EXACTLY what is bitcoin and what you are doing ?
 have you read 
  ?
 have you paid 15 million usd to get the required licences to do that legally in the US ? 
@_date: 2013-05-08 03:18:38
 fully pre mined, not really open source, clearly not decentralized.
 false debt money illegaly emitted by a US company, everything will explode when founders wil all go to jail.
 also its not a currency like bitcoin, its just a debt and trust market

thats me ! yes I help mtgox for IRC support as an independant worker.
I m not an employee and not in japan, and have no access to mtgox servers or customer data . . . 
Also I have not specially sold "before the crash", i ve been mostly all out for weeks, thinking a price &gt;150 was crazy ( and many on irc knew for weeks I already was mostly all out ) .
Even if i had sold "before the crash" ( and again I have not ), since I have no access to mtgox servers, and no acces to any "insider" informations, I m allowed to trade, even on mtgox ( all mtgox employees are forbidden to use mtgox, i m not )
hum if there is a screenshot of something . . . i d like to see it to tell you if its a fake or not
I probably said somewhere I were "mostly all out at price 250", not that I "sold before the crash"
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:12:01
 for what I know, mtgox and magicaltux have always publicly said they want to stay 100% independant,  not accepting any funding /investors, and not distributing shares.
 more partnerships like coinlab are probably possible though.
 still afaik, money is not always the only problem, when you reach 80 gb/s ddos and are already paying the best anti ddos in the world , money is useful, but time is also needed.
@_date: 2013-04-13 22:14:30
yes many updates have been rolled out after the 12 hours cooldown, situation improved and should hopefully continue to improve

Replicant is a fully free Android distribution running on several devices.
The FSF supports the work of Replicant through its Working Together for Free Software fund. Please consider donating below.
We believe that freedom is an important end in itself — that software developers should respect the rights of users to share and modify the software they use. But the importance of freedom is made particularly evident by the first commercial Android phones. While most of the software running on the phones is free, and can be distributed by anyone, some components are proprietary. These components include several libraries and drivers necessary for interfacing with the phone’s hardware. Since these components are not free software, the user community cannot redistribute them. And since some of them are necessary to make the phone work, the user community can’t share working firmwares.

the problem is not really that they were not "caring" its the timing of the fincen. . . .
Issued: 	March 18, 2013
exactly after the announce of the partnership and just before the planned migration . . . . perhaps conlab are the bad guys but . . . . the timing of fincen was perfect to fuck it all

 That cant be a glitch , with mtgox an order will appear in the order book only if its funded, so yes, someone have 210000 btcs if he could post this order.
 If you have the bitcoins, no problem, anyone is allowed to post a funded order and then cancel it

you should have read my link :
 
its legal . . . if you pay for licences in every US state like paypal did : 
 total price to be allowed to legally trade bitcoins in the US : around 15M USD
see also :
( they say  $25 million “insurance bond” there, where I said 15M usd, and they probably know better than me )
 please guys, ask it to a decent lawyer before its too late ( unless you already paid the 25M usd for the US licences.

yes, and the volume was also very high at this time with 0 % fees, the improvements to the engine and the rate limit on placing new orders improved greatly the performaces and lag for hours, until new attacks came against the api, more fixes have been rolled out and situation is improving again.

no ! a runour is not a news, never, and until now coindesk was not a rumour website
as far as I m concerned, if this is confirmed to be a rumour, coindesk will loose most of its credibility
 well if they could buy cheap coins with it . . . good for them
also they said "Sources close to China’s Central Bank" and "A reputable source told CoinDesk that "
thus adding much weight to the rumour

 http api is very stable and reliable, near 99.99 % uptime . .. websocket is . . .errr . . . experimental and not ultra stable yet
 imo, wherever you can use the http api, choose it over websocket.
 if you use websocket, code a fallback to http api on silence or crash
