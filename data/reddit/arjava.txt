I am not in the habit of taking orders from people who cannot comprehend a simple paragraph. You do understand that the original post is at the top of the thred, yes ? Well then read it carefully. Every 10th post it seems is about coinbase - do you harass the people that post on that subject. This is not your private clubhouse. As for giving away information we work hard to identify: Not bloody likely.

and there you go, 439. Time to buy the bitcoin exmachinalibertas. ( tough handle for a dyslexic )

Look, I understand that the core group of persons active here are purists with an understanding of the technology and many are responsible for the success of Bitcoin - I appreciate that. Investors like myself who took the time to understand the tech and believe in what the community is doing also know that the price of Bitcoin is critical to the success of the project. There are new readers here every day and they don't know who Gavin is or anything at all about FUD. It is important that those just learning about this system understand that there are extremely well-equipped organized actors that stand to lose billions when their businesses are disrupted. The next 4 month period is critical and I thought it may help to alert those new to the community. Yesterday morning I predicted that there would be a 30 point drop in price - it was to be expected. My intention was not to give market advice but I have to say that information if implemented in a short trade would allow some to take off the next 5 years from work. I am not telling bad actors anything they do not know here: If after normal trade activity resulted in a one day 30 point drop in price someone then stepped in and sold $20mm worth of Bitcoin across the world on exchanges that has the potential to set Bitcoin back 2 years insofar as public sentiment is concerned IF that move creates a sell panic: The more that the community is aware of these threats the less likely a run on Bitcoin will occur. This is really the only time I have ever posted anything on any blog and possible the last. My respect for the community in this particular sub aside, There are many ill mannered and angry folks here and I cannot understand why they treat each other with such disrespect. Thats it. I'm out.

Good to know. It is just that we saw quite a bit of disinformation here earlier this year. Only trying to help: sorry if I have offended certain persons. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 12:45:08
Thank you for that. What I am talking about are anything but "kids" ,
however: We all owe green beret (reddit contributor) a great deal for shedding more light on these layered attacks. Think about what is at stake for businesses like State Street, for example ( not accusing them). 
@_date: 2016-04-28 00:40:23
Fairly angry group: Why is that ? In my post I did say there would be a sell-off to 440. That is not market analysis  - I just happen to know what I am talking about.
@_date: 2016-04-27 19:07:26
I really am actually impressed and I am not personally able to investigate in the same manner as yourself. However there are those around me that do have certain skills ( perhaps you are more skilled, that is possible ) and they were unequivocal in their analysis of a particular 3 day event in March ( I believe ). But this type of event is a small part of what I believe to be the organized spreading of fear and uncertainty by those at risk.

Yes, it is Italian for aren't you clever.

I like it.
@_date: 2016-04-27 18:35:46
yes, something like that.

Spam or flooding attacks may continue until such time as the network is fully established and large enough to absorb any attack: I am more concerned with sentiment which in a large degree is dictated by poor journalism and planted stories on a very large organized scale: this is not fear or imagination. Flooding has recognizable signatures we may identify so no, certainly not willing to label organic growth as spam attack. There was in fact a significant flooding event recently and it was most certainly not organic growth. For the record I believe that at some point in the future at least 1% of the worlds invested wealth will be in bitcoin. No fear, only recognition of reality.
@_date: 2016-04-28 16:38:44
I am that good. But that was not the point of my post which I think is obvious.
@_date: 2016-04-27 20:16:32
during this bull run, probably when profit takers drive the price back to 440, we may expect a series of large sale orders on the exchanges designed to,,,
We are currently at roughly 455 down 15. 15 more to go with profit takers.

Many of the readers here are investors and likely unaware of the situation. Do you think that those with billions to lose are going to stand by and watch ? If investors are aware of the tactics they are more likely not to be disturbed by these events. So I certainly hope this post is accepted in that light. 
@_date: 2016-04-27 18:33:17
very impressed.
@_date: 2016-01-26 18:30:00
Would be interested to hear the views of those with insight.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:41:57
Last week that volume was 1.5mm. Right now 457k is average for that exchange.
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:54:47
LMAO. Sad but true.

I think that U&gt;S&gt; Gov. literally pay for the paper it is printed on.

It's the technology, stupid. 
Perhaps these journalists should consider learning about a topic on which they are going to write. The value of the Token related to a world-altering technology is not the total value of the eco-system. If you added up the investment and value of the of all mining operations and infrastructure that would be a start - add that to the potential which of course this man hasn't a clue: ZERO

Why would you care if some morons with no life down-votes you ?
@_date: 2016-06-03 14:57:23
Chinese can roll any time of day but u r right; not China this time. Volume on Huobi and OK average but the spread now with US exchanges is more narrow than it has been in a few weeks.
@_date: 2016-12-27 20:18:37
My understanding is that over-the-counter large purchases made outside exchanges isn't unusual or necessarily injurious to the market, was just wondering if anyone who has the ability to identify a pattern by examining the Blocks has done so.
@_date: 2016-12-31 23:28:35
Thats about what you can expect from 95% of these folks - all you need to know right now is THIS THING IS HAPPENING.
BUY AND HODL.

The technical news with Segwit advancing and LN developing has never been more positive, Jihan's Exploit has recently been largely neutralized, Exchanges are being held accountable by BTC friendly Governments, etc etc.  It's clear that uninformed investors took the price to new heights and they spook easily and bail. Think it is just that simple.
@_date: 2017-05-16 01:31:16
Ah, Yes it was you, Rosie I was speaking to. That was the first thing that I did but will try again.

Is it a deception for certain ? Since I have not a clue re the tech evidence (or the lack thereof) my only clues are in his demeanor: I see a guy very pissed off that he has to stand there and talk about himself at all. The tax story is compelling. His resume looks remarkable, but again, I am not a qualified judge. I believe he was outed and is responding but this is based on what I see.
@_date: 2017-05-24 16:43:00
There was and is no BTC without these  "nerd's" minds.
My understanding is Etherium becomes redundant with Segwit properly implemented (Rootstock), Please correct if wrong. Silbert and company's ( Big Business partners) loss in that event so maybe that is reason for stalling.

I wasn't speaking to ill mannered trash.
