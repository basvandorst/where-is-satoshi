Why not EOS or ethereum? One of the dapp platform which could be huge

i love more competition in the field. However, nothing is going to match the speed of a dedicated block chain like EOS.

yes, ICO is the biggest today and just the start.
Dapps are going to be big in 2018 / 19. Bitshares, Steemit are just a start. Dapps were limited as Ethereum transactions per section was too low to support Dapps.
We will surely see several decentralised Dapps in the next year or so. If you look at the blockchains now many coins are just creating a blockchain since ethereum cant run it. EOS will make it much easier to do DAPPs instead of creating a full blockchain!

no there will solutions like myetherwallet where you set your private key and read just your email and so on. We are just at the start of all this and things will be easy for everyone to use very fast.

True. But Charles is also upset that EOS got a higher rating than Cardano

dont invest more than what you can afford to lose!

What happens when 21m are mined? What is the incentive for miners? I am sure it can't be as profitable or provide the same level of security with just transaction fees

nice rotating bitcoin logos! :)

I doubt that. Coinmarketcap 24 hour BCH trading volume is $366 million. Thats not nothing! 
BCH is likely to stay in top 4 crypto for a while!

with this transaction fee level no one is going to buy coffee and pay the money for coffee on transaction fee.

London had bitcoin ATM's for ages!

A fool and his money are soon parted.
- True
However he is no fool if he has 85k just lying around to speculate!

See 
They have been constantly removing money from their cold storage to fund outgoing transfers.
However just 100million drop. They are still doing very well!

i dont even own bitcoin and i still watch the charts :)

There are so many ALT coins. What would people fight over 21m coins?
I am sure that 10m coins are also lost for ever!! People lose their private key / forget that they have coins etc. I will be surprised if more than 11 million are in circulation!

will this wallet do?  
how will someone be able to access alt bitcoin after fork?
