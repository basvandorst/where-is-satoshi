It's kind of a grey area tbh, for instance if I buy a gift card with bitcoins from a merchant via Bitpay, it comes through as soon as the transaction is picked up by the network. It feels instant to me, but the tx doesn't get included in a block (confirmed) until minutes later. Bitpay takes on that risk, albeit very small.
A fee is recommended, but not required. It might sit for days if you don't include one, but most likely it will eventually get confirmed. And if the coins are old enough or the tx is large enough, a fee isn't required as it is prioritized by the network. There's a formula that determines this.

Listen to your own analysis, not Tony's. That said, the bear market is just about completed by my analysis, so not a bad time to buy. Big double bottom on the weekly chart. Upside projection does put us around $600 if it plays out technically, so he's obviously not pulling these numbers out of thin air.

Charts are looking scarily bullish, yes. Considering how quickly the price ran from $100 to $800 during 2013 (then blew off to $1200 from momentum), taking out the previous all time high with ease ($266) I don't even want to know what kind of roller coaster we are in for if this is truly a bull market. Buckle up if it is. 
@_date: 2015-12-17 18:56:04
The success of Bitcoin is founded in the benefits of decentralization. This is why Bitcoin is successful, this is why modern finance wants to imitate it even if they don't know why. Sure they can borrow its database and security model in order to "catch up," but they are largely missing the big picture by doing this.
Bitcoin and other decentralized protocols were created because it has become increasingly apparent that humans operating in centralized institutions (be it corporations, governments, banks and even churches) *cannot be trusted* and will eventually make mistakes or act selfishly. This causes systemwide inefficiencies which grow, guild and even protect their own existence due to a centralized incentive structure. While the players in these centralized institutions are not inherently evil, they are participating in a system where large amounts of power and influence are controlled by a relative few. This tends to encourage corruption and stifle innovation, often at the expense of humans' civil liberties and the very fruits of their labor. We have seen the negative results of this throughout history.
People who enjoy this power or benefit from it have a difficult time seeing outside of the gates. I think that some individuals working within centralized financial systems do see the benefits of Bitcoin but are unsure how to integrate it in a world that is used to (and even craves) centralized power. Perhaps we are in the early stages of a gradual shift.

IBM could in theory release a coin or financial instrument associated with whatever blockchain they wanted to secure. Instead of a currency, though, it would be more like a stock in their "Internet of Things" technology. The cool thing about this is that the average person could buy or mine it without being an accredited investor or a venture capitalist (who usually get smart money into tech pre-IPO). Surely there would be regulatory and open source hurdles for a large company to do this, but it's a pretty interesting idea nonetheless.

**Bitcoin Security 101**
* Don't download torrents, cracks, or other questionable untrusted software on the same system where you access wallets. If you must torrent where your wallets are, use Linux. 
* Use 2FA where possible. Keep paper copies in a secure location. 
* In Windows, perform all day-to-day activities on a user account **without** admin rights. 
* Use an open-source password manager like Keepass and protect the database with a strong password. Strong as in [Diceware]( strong. You will eventually memorize this password. 
* Keep your wallets encrypted with random 32 character passwords stored in password database. 
* Regularly back up encrypted wallets and password manager database to multiple locations. 
This is all one needs to do to be safe. There's a slight learning curve but if you have the intelligence to understand Bitcoin you can surely do this. And you'll sleep better at night.

A transaction fee should always be included, however small, as an incentive to miners to include your transaction in the next block. I use 2 cent tx fees and it always gets confirmed on time. You could probably do 1 cent and the miners would still pick it up.
The only time a tx fee is not really needed is when sending larger transactions, like whole coins. Those automatically get higher priority on the network.

The Fed sets the interest rate on the money they loan to the US govt. Manipulation of that rate causes the business cycle and economic boom and busts. Those who set it are not elected, rather they are politically appointed (having been associated with the banking industry or made their way up through the Federal Reserve system.)
Massive inflation might pay off my debt and credit cards, but my weekly grocery trip would be that much more expensive. So my quality of life would not increase. 
The Fed loans money to the US govt so politicians can decide how to spend it. Lobbyists are after the politicians with access to that new money, which is how crony capitalism occurs. Make no mistake, those fresh billions are big business. It's no coincidence that Washington DC is massively expanding and growing at a record pace. 
When new money makes its way through the economy, often it goes to the 1% first through Wall Street. Think bank bailouts. That money subsequently props up the markets and enriches those with 401Ks and related securities. The lower classes simply lose x% of their savings through inflation. 
Where does all this money that the Federal Reserve loans out come from, you ask? The answer is nothing. They just input numbers into a computer and boom, new money. It's how fractional reserve banking works.

Yes it would be hardforked. Bitcoin has been forked before, and it's important to remember that because it's beta software, it might be forked again sometime in the future. What you describe is a large enough problem that most miners would probably agree with a given solution, given enough time to verify the math on their own. Have you participated in a hard fork? I have. Everyone switches to a new chain with a few button presses. It takes like two minutes and usually involves new wallet software. Not scary. As long as most miners agree (and they will if Bitcoin's security is at risk), no problem.
@_date: 2014-12-15 19:10:10
Think of it this way. Bitcoin is only used by a small percentage of the world's population, so the potential for growth is larger than, say, if Bitcoin were used by 30% of the population. Higher risk, higher reward, meaning the responsibility is more on you to learn about best security practices. 
Truly, generating secure addresses offline is not that hard to do. 
One way: Download the bitaddress.org website to a formatted USB stick. Turn off and unplug your home internet, boot into Linux using a Live CD and open it in a browser. Verify the hash to ensure the site is legit (instructions are right there) and generate a bunch of addresses. These are your cold storage wallets. Print them out and put them somewhere secure. Now send bitcoins to them once you are back online. Repeat this process every time you need secure addresses whose private keys have never touched the internet. 
@_date: 2014-09-21 17:15:53
When a trader enters a margin short trade they do so by borrowing someone else's bitcoins (with interest) to sell. In order to do this, they need enough collateral in their trading account to prove they are good for it and can borrow x amount against it (generally 3:1). The idea is that when the price is low enough, they "cover" their short--that is pay back the bitcoins they sold and pocket the rest. 
Now this can quickly go sour--if the price rises far enough so that it's clear the trader won't be able to repay the bitcoins, he automatically receives a margin call by the trading engine. That is, his collateral is used to buy bitcoins. Sometimes this triggers other margined shorts and the cascading margin calls drive the price up very quickly.
This all works on the long side too, except that if you think the market is going up, you borrow dollars or euros to buy bitcoins, sell them at a higher price, pay back the loan, pocket the extra, etc. Trading on margin is risky but it "amplifies" your gains and losses.

After trading this market for over a year, I can give you my take. I believe we've turned the cart around but have a ways to go. Let's get to $800 and then we'll talk. We will bounce off a few major resistances before we snowball up again. 
And it will snowball. We are still too young to see steady growth. Bitcoin is an exciting technology with extremely limited supply so bull markets are fast &amp; furious. Coins are pulled from exhanges en mass to sell at higher prices creating incredible demand. It's the opposite of a crash.
@_date: 2014-12-13 21:17:47
While Bitcoin is still technically in beta, volatile and controversial, it presents a unique investment opportunity. Because bitcoins are the inventive needed to continually add computing power to the mining network, they act as a both a stock (Bitcoin the distributed corporation), a form of exchange (Bitcoin the currency), a store of value (Bitcoin the commodity) and a gateway into and out of future cryptocurrency services, like smart contracts.
There hasn't been any asset like it before. Explaining it to newcomers is an impossible challenge because it encompasses multiple dense topics: computer technology, economics, and finance. In theory, the limited supply of bitcoins should ensure that their value increases with adoption. Because of market dynamics (supply and demand), this does not occur right away. 
I run a small cryptocurrency market liquidity business (essentially trading, automated and manual). My "professional" suggestion to "potential investors" is to learn as much as you can about the protocol, buy an amount you are comfortable losing, and hold for a couple years in cold storage. It is a risky investment, but most of these people already have well-diversified 401Ks. 
My "personal" opinion (for friends and family) about the market is that you won't likely see bitcoins cheaper than $300 ever again. It could pay off with big gains if crypto technology takes off, and it could all go to hell tomorrow.
As a quick caveat, investing in traditional stock and bond markets is not without risk, no matter how safe it may seem with current regulations in place, designed with tax incentives making it oh-so-easy for the masses to hand over part of every paycheck to Wall Street. The legacy banking system has already been to hell and back multiple times, each time having been "rescued" by our benevolent leaders (using your money) from problems of massive centralization of power and corruption that will not get fixed anytime in this decade. Suffice it to say that they have their own problems to bear, which is why Satoshi created Bitcoin in the first place.

Like other have said, always enable 2FA.
Here's another good security tip when using Windows. When you do Bitcoin business DO NOT use an account with admin privileges. If you're able to install programs without entering a password YOU ARE USING AN ADMIN ACCOUNT. When you use an admin account, malware will have access to (and be able to modify) any file on your hard drive. Unfortunately, this is how Windows operates by default.
It's best to create a user account without admin privileges and use that for day-to-day work. Even if you accidentally download malware, this prevents it from working by locking down everything that isn't in your immediate user folder. Sure you'll have to enter your admin password to run certain programs, but it's worth it.

There are professional interests, myself included, in every market whose goal is to make money. And we certainly do. Bitcoin is no different. 
I don't care about a hypothesis you learned in economics class; we want to corner the market on a stock so it's easy to mark up later, then call all our friends in the media to suck in the herd during a bull market so we can sell to them. That's how the game works and one can either play along or not.

Except for the extreme hassle. I've had it happen three times this year and it takes time to get the money back. One time the thief charged and charged until my account was overdrawn. Another time my bank actually denied the claim and I had to resubmit and write a letter to a higher-up to get it approved, which took about a month. It is an absolute PITA. Oh and they cancel your debit/credit card, so you can't use it until they send you a new one via snail mail.

That would not have been the likely outcome. Pain, losses, yes, but not savings accounts. The bankers would have had their savings wiped out, so they pressured Congress to pass legislation to protect them (just as every special interest group does) using fears that everyone would lose their savings if they didn't bet bailed out for being overexposed in the lending markets.

I know all about Monero. It's one of the "good" altcoins. The problem is not the intention of the coin dev (whether they aim to create something good or not) but the expectation of the market price by investors who may be bright but have no idea how markets function. Many of them end up falling in love with a coin and buy high sell low, or simply buy high and watch the value slowly flatline, waiting and hoping to get out and transfer their bags to someone else.  
IMO Bitcoin is plenty speculative without having to add the penny stock/"invest in my coin" salesman mentality which is pervasive to the point of annoyance in the altcoin world. It probably pays to wait and see which altcoins (if any) will follow Bitcoin's relative success.

Steps to get a credit card:
* 1) Fill out a credit application, usually without reading the fine print, and usually when you're too young to understand how debt really works other than knowing that building a credit score is important. Don't forget to include all of your personal information on the application, including your monthly wage and Social Security number.
* 2) Wait for the credit card company to look up your credit score. It helps if you already have multiple open credit cards. This ensures you have a good credit score and credit card companies can make money from lending to you.
* 3) Smile when you get a shiny card in the mail with a $1500 credit limit and 0% APR for a year. Plus you get cash back points for every dollar you spend! 
* 4) Frown when for the rest of your life, your personal information you used on the original application is sold to private companies to hunt you down and solicit you for more credit cards. Once you get one or two, it never ends. 
* 5) Smile when the credit company raises your limit to $2500, then $5000, then $10,000, encouraging you to accumulate even more debt.
* 6) Express frustration when you miss ONE payment, even if it's a day late, your APR rises to 28% and you're hit with a $40 late fee.
* 7) Take out a loan to buy a car, because your credit score is pretty good and you can get a low APR. Besides, all of your neighbors are doing it.
* 8) Based upon your timely credit and car payments, you now qualify for a home mortgage. Since all your friends have one, why not? Your credit score is already great from paying off those credit cards and car loans, and you have a good monthly income from a job that's pretty secure.
* 9) Express frustration when the neighborhood you chose to live in is not what it once was 10 years ago, but moving is a difficult option as the value of your property has dropped 15% thanks to the Central Bank holding interest rates artificially low for too long which encouraged too much lending and inflated a credit bubble which burst and put your job at risk.
* 10) Live in silent fear for the rest of your life, living paycheck to paycheck (as most Americans do) in a house you don't actually own, driving a car you don't actually own, knowing that if you miss ONE payment, your benevolent credit masters who you've given so much through the years in interest and late payments, who are responsible for  recessions that caused your friends, family and neighbors to lose their jobs, who were bailed out to the tune of hundreds of billions of dollars the US doesn't actually have (and subsequently putting your children on the hook for), will kick you and your family to the curb without hesitation. 
* 11) Redeem your cash back points for a few Best Buy gift cards.

It's a type of harmonic language that defines not only how one chord progresses to the next, but the overall structure of the piece. I have a music degree so we took four years of it to understand its impact on music today. It's why classical music (Beethoven, Mozart, Verdi) sounds the way it does. Bach is considered the master and generally his counterpoint is extremely complex and contains no errors. His organ fugues are the pinnacle of the art form IMO. During that time counterpoint was taught from the time you were a child (if you were musically inclined) along with Latin. Not so much today.

Elimination of counterparty trust is the major benefit of cryptos and their blockchains. Currency is simply the most obvious use of them.

True. It takes a significant knowledge (or desire to learn) to store and secure Bitcoin today. The wallets are easy to use. More importantly Bitcoin is a protocol that can easily be built upon. Much like the early protocols of the internet allowed us freedom to transfer information (and to build killer apps upon it like email and web browsers), protocols like Bitcoin allows us to build apps toward the transfer of value, ownership and property without third party trust.

Markets move in cycles. Bulls markets don't last forever just as bear markets don't last forever. At market tops, the general public is buying while the professional interests sell. Sentiment is ecstatic. At market bottoms, the opposite happens. Nobody wants the stock and the trolls are out in full force--sentiment is very gloomy.
Fear is the primary driver of human emotion, and make no mistake that professional traders take advantage of this to profit. We are fully aware that nobody wants to buy at market bottoms and that sentiment will be negative. We expect this behavior. This is why we sell until a price range is found where other professionals (we recognize their behavior in the market) are happy to buy and accumulate. 
We know that once few enough hands hold most of the bitcoins, the price will go up easily and the public will begin buying feverishly. When this happens and most of the selling has gone, a bull market will occur.
More importantly, we know that higher prices will attract the interest of the public, because they don't know the value of something unless they're told by the media.

I think the days of $200 coins are behind us. We may get a stairstep decline to correct the most recent advance. If that's the case, and this rally back to $400 looks weak and doesn't gain a following (low/declining volume, narrowing candle spread, tendency to "roll over" in a crowning formation), one could see a potential short sale near the top of it.

More sellers than buyers. Lots of public buying and amateur trader types leverging long positions on good news, waiting for Bitcoin to make them rich. Perfect opportunity for the bigger traders to unload. This creates a downtrend (large correction), be prepared. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:59:55
Thanks. I generally do my analysis/trading in isolation of forum noise and news items, though after a big move I'll pop in to get a sentiment analysis. I'm not super bearish yet but the inability to rally here is a little worrying. We are also up against a long-term point and figure projection (measured from the year-long accumulation of 2015 which is the cause of this bull market) and now I'm seeing lots of stopping action and tapering off of volume, indicating that buyers may be retreating. This leaves the market in a vulnerable position.
I will also say that the feeding frenzy of the new quarterly futures contract last night was a little alarming. Historically, when the market is truly bullish, this buying can easily move the price into a new, higher trading range. But it didn't. I'm wondering if people are simply getting greedy.
@_date: 2016-06-09 04:41:14
Experienced investors see the price going straight up in a very short time as a negative condition: demand eventually becomes exhausted after the inexperienced investors are filled to the brim with shares, then supply comes in bigtime as the experienced take profits. That's why markets eternally get overheated to one side and eventually correct. Bitcoin is a master class in this. Yes supply and demand, but at the public's expense.
Funny story about this--recently I was cleaning out old receipts and I found the one for my first Bitcoin. The date? Right at the top of the April 2013 bubble. Literally within days of the highest price. I never made that mistake again. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:20:33
I'm definitely aware of this story/theory and the evidence to support it as I was there and remember it well. It's why I'm not a fan of quick moves like this--seemingly out of nowhere--because of the long, drawn out corrections they cause. 
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:48:34
Well that's great. By rich I mean hundreds of thousands or millions of dollars. Like people who owned thousands of coins from early days. Many of them made serious money (the ones who knew to cash out).
@_date: 2016-06-10 21:54:30
What I mean by that is that no one expected it while it was being *prepared* for the move to $1200. Price crashed to $60, recovered to $100 and slowly moved sideways for quite a while. Market moves are made in the *preparation* by supply slowly, gradually being removed from the market while it moves sideways. Then when a little demand comes in, zoom, up it goes, drawing in the public. Sure once the thing gets moving, it's "to da moon!" all over the place. The people who really got rich already owned bitcoins from $60 and $100 (or $2) when the general expectation was nowhere near $1200 and the tech wasn't a guarantee. Few people got rich buying at $500, $800 and higher. 
In other words, people who got rewarded by buying at $2 or $60 or $100 had no clue it would go that high.
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:43:11
Not a big fan of using history as an investment tactic--history also teaches me that quick rises can be followed by violent corrections. RSI is just some guy's opinion of the market; an equation he created.
@_date: 2016-06-10 22:44:43
I remember the rainbow chart. I think you do have a point--many believed and were investing based on past performance. One should also take into account of the maturing of Bitcoin's markets, allowing for traders to profit by limiting the severity of up and down moves. This will make any rainbow chart fairly obsolete over time as professional traders move in. 
I'm also talking about market theory in general from the strict technical viewpoint of supply and demand. No matter what the fundamentals, every market everywhere is beholden to this law, causing them to move from bull to bear markets and back without exception. Even Ethereum. It may not have its down move today or next month, but it will eventually. I mean it's great tech don't get me wrong, but not immune.
@_date: 2016-06-10 17:32:28
RSI is definitely not a panacea, nor is any technical indicator. I've completely loosed myself from them and operate on price/volume principles alone. Not so say that you're wrong, but I can find a number of indicators that support any position at any time (just look at the daily MACD). For me, indicators were becoming a search to justify what I wanted to happen instead of looking at what was actually happening.
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:59:33
There is a larger than normal amateur element in the Bitcoin market, meaning the price tends to trend longer and correct harder than in mature markets, like the S&amp;P.
@_date: 2016-06-10 16:49:07
Trader/market technician here... although we are in an uptrend, the price is running up against the $600 resistance, a range where a lot of new buyers got hooked back in the summer of 2014. If the market can absorb these offerings from old buyers looking to get out breakeven, it will go higher. But it needs a lot of volume to do it. 
Just trying to be a pragmatic voice having traded this market since 2013 and witnessed every "to the moon" rally up close. There was only one (November 2013, from $200 to $1200) and it came when nobody was expecting it. Now I see a flood of new buyers waiting around to get rich. Not good. The market is not as young as 2013 and probably will not be making people rich overnight like that ever again. (IMO)
I'm sure this will fall on mostly deaf ears, but my suggestion is to wait until Bitcoin goes on sale--this usually happens a few times a year after the price has come down very quickly on high volume, usually accompanying some drama or bad news. This is the time to buy. Historically: $2, $80, $200, $300, $400. See a pattern?
@_date: 2016-06-10 19:36:38
I'm in agreement the halving is largely priced in at this point. The upside, if there is any left, is relatively minimal IMO and not worth playing for in my strategy. But I hold bitcoins so I'm thrilled if that happens, just not speculating for that final push.
In my view, the bulk of the accumulation occurred in the year trading range between $200-300 that ended the bear market. Then the terminal shakeout in August flushed the longs and paved the way for a sustained advance in Oct/Nov, which we got. It was organic, long and drawn out with healthy pullbacks (until the parabolic rise) and good volume expansion. This rally reminds me more of summer 2014--big volume out of nowhere and pretty much straight up from the get-go. What worries me is that demand is never unlimited in a rally no matter what the fundamentals (people only have so much money), and when it dries up bad things can happen to the price.

There is if you doubt the longevity of the current financial system. Miners regularly replace their equipment with faster and more efficient hardware, otherwise there are no profits. It's an arms race and not an easy industry to be in (former miner here) unless you care about what cryptocurrencies represent on some level. 
Their selfish interest (finding bitcoins) is what keeps the network running securely, not laws or altruism. That is, they will not risk altering the protocol unless the change addresses the problem at hand only, and if the change does not risk destabilization of the protocol and/or markets.

Miners have to make up their investment, so it's not as simple as that. Most equipment you buy today will not make as much Bitcoin mining than if you simply bought at market due to the network difficulty increases. 
Mining is incredibly competetive and unless you have nearly free electricity or reduced overhead in some other way, you'll barely break even.  I get the feeling that many large miners like Bitcoin or they wouldn't bother. True that small miners either mine for a hobby or take a loss, or to receive coinbase tx bitcoins.

Mass adoption doesn't have to be high for the price to skyrocket. Price is a function of supply and demand of coins on the exchanges, for the most part. When there is a shortage and demand increases a little bit, the price can go up very quickly.

It comes down to quality of ownership. Today, the quality is quite good. Only people who understand Bitcoin tech hold them, they probably bought at what seems today an attractive price, and they plan on holding them for awhile. This eventually creates a bull market as there is not significant enough selling to overwhelm existing demand. Once demand increases a little, the price rises quickly with no selling to stop it. You could say that the high quality, informed owners temporarily corner the market at these low prices, creating a shortage.
Contrast that to dramatic, speculative price runups where the ownership quality becomes poor. Herds of public, uninformed investors flock to buy near the market top from the same informed investors who loaded up near the bottom. They may not even understand Bitcoin but they want to ride the money train. Demand seems insatiable as they come out of the woodwork, driving the price very high. Once their demand is exhausted, the market turns downward and they immediately panic and sell. This creates a bear market as every rise is met with enormous amounts of selling from the same herd who is now disillusioned. Only when the last of them have folded will the market bottom out and high quality ownership once again enter to buy up the remaining supply.
And so the market continually cycles with endless variations on this theme.

Trading volume and interest in Bitcoin has been on the rise since coming out of a bear market in October/November, bringing in many new buyers. This is probably the most logical explanation as sending BTC back and forth to exchanges and wallets creates multiple transactions per user, not to mention exchange backends managing huge wallets during high volume periods. Like it or not, the speculation business is a large and integral part of any asset class so tx volume should logically coincide with large price increases and decreases.

@_date: 2015-09-03 14:21:00
I don't support BIP101 but I support larger block sizes. I respect all of the efforts the devs have put in while realizing they are under a lot of stress to offer a solution that satisfies everyone. People on both sides need to understand that this is Bitcoin growing up, and that is a good thing. 
(I would rather see the limit increase to 2mb in the short term to allow further discussion on the topic, rather than seeing a non-optimal solution rushed through.)
The market is waiting for some good news. It hates uncertainty and drama. If the devs can hold hands for awhile and put aside their differences, it would give the impression that a solution is *in the works* rather than giving an impression that there's division and rivalry. The market is holding a strong line of support after a year of liquidation and subsequent range bound consolidation and will be sensitive to buying pressure going forward. We all might get a nice surprise should we pull together and restore some confidence. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 21:53:58
Hypothetical: Say a group of miners successfully pull off a 21% attack in 2020 and reduce the blocksize back to 2mb from say 50mb, effectively grinding the network to a halt and forcing users to pay more for priority confirmation. At 2mb there will be fewer transactions getting confirmed per day than at 50, so that's less overall revenue for miners to compete for. No doubt the market would detect this before it happened and the price would crash in short order, making those transaction fees worth even less and the window of opportunity to collect and sell them very small. I fail to see the incentive there.
A malicious incentive always exists to hurt the network or reduce adoption, but those attempts will be detected early as we've seen before. (Like when a pool gets close to 50% of hashpower, miners will leave to other pools to protect their investment and thus the network.) Truth is we haven't yet seen any evidence of malicous actors attempting to take control or influence the network as many have predicted would happen by now. It simply has not occurred because there is no good incentive for it *to* occur.
Miners will ultimately be incentivized against doing irrational things to the network (like creating a fee market) as dictated by the value of the tokens awarded to them, bitcoins. Even if they are given more power by voting, they will be the ones to suffer the brunt of damage if the price falls should they use that power irresponsibly, not Joe Schmoe who bought a fraction of one yesterday and wants it to moonshot tomorrow. And if a rougue majority of miners *was* detected to be a threat (which it would), other miners could simply refuse to relay those blocks to protect their investments, effectively negating the attack and whatever money the attacker invested in accumulating all of that hashpower. He'd be better off simply mining for bitcoins and selling them at a higher value than risk a dramatic attack resulting in fewer bitcoins to be sold at a lower market value.
BIP100 is not a perfect solution but I like it better than BIP101, which, in my view, introduces more potential for unintended consequences which should be avoided at all costs. 
@_date: 2015-09-01 16:54:08
I remember reading a proposal a couple days ago that essentially combined BIP101's block limit as a maximum and BIP100's limit as a minimum, and allowing the miners to vote on that. Is that discussion still on the table?

It wasn't part of the April 2013 bubble which was actually a higher % rise. 
Watch the orderbooks during a parabolic move and they are thin as paper as everyone gets greedy and takes their coins off exchange to sell later. There is so little selling that the price moves are insane and panic buying sets in. It is the opposite of a crash. Willy was a minor part of the $1200 bubble. People who watched the market know there were much larger forces at work.

The market ran out of demand at $1100. Sellers outnumbered buyers at that price level which eventually pushed the market over the edge and immediately put everyone (Chinese or not) who bought near the top under stress to sell. The China situation was simply a convenient news item to blame the inevitable volatility on. Markets are ugly like that when they run up so fast and far. 
The world is full of amateur investors who buy near tops. If they sell out at a higher price, great, but most don't or else there wouldn't be such a thing as a bear market.

That's an extraordinary claim.

From what I understand BIP100 allows miners to vote on how large (or small) blocks need to be so to create a congestion free network and storage-efficient blockchain. The problem there is the 21% attack, which combining the two proposals would mitigate and allow Bitcoin room to scale, be it quickly (BIP101) or more gradually (BIP100) as the need arises. Someone correct me if I'm wrong in this assumption.

Interesting. That number might vary depending on where we are in the larger market cycle. My guess is people holding more than $100 in Bitcoin has drastically decreased since 11/2013, and will increase should another bull cycle occur.

A blockchain isn't a blockchain if it's centralized by a company or corporation and they can alter it at will. Then it's simply a fancy database.

This is when you sell out to have cash to buy the capitulations later in the bear market. 
News usually acts as a reason to mark up and down the price based on where the market stands technically and is not usually the actual reason for the move (that is to say the rise or fall would be much less if the guys moving 1,000+ coins weren't trading).

Probably not--the buyers will likely pay above market price (a premium) for the ability to buy that many bitcoins at once.
Try buying 1000+ quickly on any exchange and the price will quickly run away on you. Not only are the orderbooks thin to support that kind of buying, but other traders will see your buying and begin marking the price up against you.
If the markets become very broad and volumes increase dramatically over the next few months (as in a bull market with greater public participation) that would provide a much better opportunity to sell them without slippage. But prices will be much higher at that point. If I was a large buyer that would be my plan.

These recent, positive news articles are a good indication that the price bottom we have been forming for months is indeed evidence of accumulation by professional interests. This is normal behavior at the foothills of a mountainous bull market as they (backpacks now stuffed with coinage) all contact their friends at major news outlets to drive the public into buying. 
As a trader myself, I have been buying like a madman since $180 and have observed multiple signs of accumulation on the charts over multiple timeframes in at least a dozen trading ranges. This is all very bullish as these interests have now essentially cornered the market of any floating supply from weak hands and price can be easily marked up in the absence of significant selling. 
As a rule I don't give unsolicited trading advice as my responsibility is to my own, but as the driving force that is accumulation shoots the price out of trading range after trading range, it is not difficult to imagine what may happen next.

You make a good point, but institutions don't invest that way. Individuals with no market experience do. Professionals build positions quietly during dull markets, being careful not to bid the price up against themselves. They buy what they can, when they can and sell the same way, usually near the tops when there is huge public demand. The institutions supporting the price in this market cycle are probably more speculative than in future price cycles, but that is the nature of the beast. Gemini, ItBit and other properly licensed providers will be more relevant in the future.

Of course they would average out, but throwing the coins back at the market for a few dollars profit per coin is a terrible risk/reward strategy that no serious investor would take. Even if you sell slowly the absorption power of the market will be reduced and drive prices down.
Overall I feel these auctions are used by large investors expecting higher prices. What they do after they buy is anyone's guess, but if you're buying at the bottom of a price cycle there is going to be much more liquidy (public demand) and profit potential on the way back up.

Accumulation is the "secret" way that professional interests buy stock, bonds, or anything else they are interested in selling at higher prices. It usually happens when the price is depressed and the majority of people are selling--it prevents the price from falling further, creating a trading range for them to accumulate. 
It's logical when you think about it. If you had a few million to buy shares in something, you wouldn't do it in the open, you'd do it in secret to get the best price. There are a number of professional accumulation techniques, all designed to buy at the lowest possible price and part weak hands from their shares. 
At market bottoms, accumulation drains supply (the only thing preventing higher prices) from the weak hands in the market who are panicked into selling. This causes higher prices. 
At market tops, distribution is the selling of accumulated stock at much higher prices to the public, who have been panicked into buying. This floods the market with supply and causes lower prices. The buyers at these levels become future weak hands.

I guess we remember differently. As it stands I don't think the bids were ever officially released so conjecture is all we have. 
Before every auction speculators always seem to get their panties in a bunch that the buyers will simply turn around and dump the coins, which doesn't make a lot of sense from a professional investing viewpoint. If I had that much money I'd "help" the market go in the direction that it wants (up) and sell into the rallies.

The problem is my bank charges an out-of-network fee in addition to whatever the atm charges. I know well the bank's atms in my city but when I'm traveling often that's not an option. It's a regional bank. And if I travel overseas, there are fees for each and every transaction. The joys of having a US regional bank, I guess. Not to mention the rampant fraud that we've had to deal with (not the bank's fault but still a problem with legacy banking). At one point I had to write the bank's vice president a personal letter in order to get a few thousand dollars back from a case that the fraud department had closed.

That way the machines won't have to rely on a third party to prove that the communication exists or is valid.

I agree. Liquidity has and will be very poor until the market cap grows. We are much better off than in 2013 with more exchanges and futures markets. Getting in and out of large positions is currently difficult when you see tumbleweeds blowing across the orderbooks.

Take a look at the orderbooks for the major exchanges (Bitstamp, Bitfinex, OKcoin) and that should give you an idea. There are volume pumping bots on some of the Chinese exchanges, but they don't really add liquidity.
To answer your question, no. Liquidity is quite low at times and sometimes minutes go by without a trade. Generally the successful traders in these markets program their own algorithms and/or have professional experience. But there are opportunities if you are good.

I agree that Bitcoin has so much more to offer. Unfortunately with the public's tendency to rush into the next *en vogue* sector (tech stocks, biotech, even real estate), Bitcoin will not shake its inherent volatility until the markets are more mature. There will be people who lose money buying the next top, and the top after that (if adoption continues). But we're getting there, and in the future price volatility won't be so severe with better pricing mechanisms.

They weren't released publicly, unfortunately. A few of the bidders did reveal and were discussed on reddit and in a few news articles. The info is probably still there if you do some media digging near the dates of the previous USM auctions. I remember being surprised that while some were lowballish, most were competitive and pretty close to market price.

One of the advantages is that you don't need to buy bitcoins from an exchange or deal with local vendors. Plug and go. It's convenient--time is money.

Traders can take long and short positions at exchanges that allow margin trading using btc as collateral. For example at Bitfinex one can deposit 3 btc and buy up to 9, which would have the same market effect as buying 9 with fiat.

Isn't this the nature of speculation in every asset class though? There is a huge contingent operating in every market everywhere that wants to buy low and sell back higher in order to better their position in life. It's programmed into our DNA as a survival tactic. Limiting this behavior to Bitcoin is disingenuous.

Nearly every asset is in a phase of a speculative bubble, be it inflating (overvalued) or deflating (undervalued). Just look at some of the stocks that took a nosedive recently, like Netflix, and how cheap they were a couple years ago. 
Price discovery is built on speculation and the size of the market determines the volatility. The best speculators use supply and demand as their guide, so eventually with enough of them and a liquid market, price discovery becomes more accurate.

I am familiar with the this process, maybe I can help. Did you sign up for a blockchain.info account? That's the wallet most people used back then. 
Bitinstant sent the bitcoins to the address listed on the form that you filled out and sent to them. Zipzap was simply the payment intermediary and I believe Moneygram was the method used to pay them at CVS.

I think you're referring to Wall Street, with which I have no experience. Having used a number of algos in digital currency markets I'm well aware of their capabilities relative to market conditions. To be honest even bots have to move money around, and if you watch the tape long enough you will recognize their behavior. In an illiquid market like Bitcoin there is simply nowhere to hide.
I would argue that trading well manually is more of an art that bots simply cannot replicate. My formal training is in music performance, and there are similarities to reading music and pattern/detail recognition on a chart. (Working on a piece of music for six hours a day goes a long way to training your brain to recognize detail.) Even the stress management that is taught to survive and perform consistently well through thousands of auditions is useful in trading.
If the fact that I use primarily volume and support/resistance puts me the minority, so be it. I'm able to live well from my profits without the need for indicators. Hopefully I can retire before the Wall Street algos come in.

I agree, the orderbooks at Huobi don't match the volume at all. It's laughable, in fact. Watch the ticker for while on Bitcoinwisdom... it's all wash volume. When Huobi went offline recently, they neglected to turn on their bots for a few hours after they came back up... Extremely low volume during that period.

I think it's a natural reaction to the dramatic shakeout this summer. With markets, large selling events have the tendency to transfer shares from weak to strong holders, and vice versa for large buying events. This quality of ownership helps to determine the ultimate strength and duration of a resulting trend once enough supply or demand enters to tip the scale and psychologically ignite it in the minds of the public. 
Another way to put it is, with enough holders you get a bull market as nobody sells into the rallies. With enough weak hands buying the tops (as they always do, unfortunately) a bear market is inevitable as prices begin to sag and doubt or bad news sets in and they all trip over themselves to sell.

Bitcoin is in a bear market and has been since the rise to $1200. 
Think of markets as a price discovery vehicle for stocks, commodities and currencies that are primarily driven by supply and demand. When supply is greater than demand, the price falls. When demand is greater, the price rises. Simple economics, right? Not exactly.
There is a little more to this when you enter humans into the equation. Humans, as we know, are imperfect and driven by fear and greed, especially when acting together in groups. This has an effect on the market by amplifying moves in one direction, creating a snowball effect that eventually climaxes with great dramatic effect. The more illiquid the market, the less there is to stop these moves. 
Bitcoin's rise to $1200 was an example of this, as was the rise to $266 in April 2013. Humans were blinded by greed and optimism, and pushed the price higher and higher until panic set in and the price went parabolic. This high price is unsustainable as many holders sell and there is not enough buyers to keep the price up. 
This buying climax sets up the bear market to follow, and has a snowballing effect in the opposite direction as fear grips the market and investors begin to unload at a loss. At some point, panic sets in again and sellers let go at a huge loss having seen their investment fizzle away over the course of the year. The crash to $166 is a good candidate for this, which marks the beginning of the end of a bear market. 
This is a cycle that will repeat, in varying degrees, as adoption continues. Humans are imperfect and driven by basic desires, so markets everywhere will tend to move in multi-year cycles and crash in both directions until this changes.

Not on exchanges. This has been discussed to death. There's not liquidity to sell that many coins without slippage, and most bids on gov't auctions revealed after the fact were close enough to market price that turning around and selling them outright would be a silly "investment" move. The bidders are generally big buyers/institutions with intent to hold them for a long time. You have to put up quite a large bankroll as deposit to even be considered for bidding if I remember correctly.

TA is not well understood by non professional traders. The problem is that new "traders" will fill a chart with them and make trades based on what they say. No, they are a tool, just like a set of drill bits or surgical equipment. You have know which one to use and when. 
Actually, professional traders use mostly price and volume along with a deep understanding of how psychology affects price action to predict price. I'd describe it more like a game of chess, which no TA will help you win. 
Generally, indicators are known and used (especially to create bots/automated traders) by the pros but they are not relied upon.

I think you are overgeneralizing things, but agree to disagree. Pro traders look at the market in terms of supply and demand and how they can profit off of an imbalance in it. While they may incorporate indicators, they don't necessarily need them. Since their application is more of an art than a science anyway, algorithms can't replace a human brain which can learn and adapt in the moment.
As a profitable trader I use candles, volume, support &amp; resistance and a very limited number of indicators. Call it whale watching. They are constantly testing the market, running stops, marking up the price, marking it down, using news as an opportunity... all sorts of tricks. Once you know how pro traders trade, the market suddenly comes alive. All you need is price and volume.
Volume is the best way to see where the big money is going. It drives price, how could it not?

My *aha* moment came when I realized that Bitcoin the blockchain allowed for so much more than Bitcoin the currency, but at the same time, Bitcoin the currency is needed to properly incentivize the network to maintain Bitcoin the blockchain. Given Bitcoin the currency's limited nature, this will cause it to be worth a lot more in the future if it is widely used, allowing Average Joe to participate in what could be the largest investment opportunity of his lifetime outside of the legacy financial system which caters to and rewards the already-wealthy. 
This is not investment advice. 
@_date: 2015-10-06 02:54:09
Less supply and the *same* demand equals a price increase. Markets are usually that simple.
Bull trends really get going when demand increases substantially and supply has been reduced via accumulation, as it has been quietly for the past 8 months.

If you read the post history of there are parallel ideas, an obvious deep knowledge of markets, and active participation and promotion of the Teamspeak chatroom.
