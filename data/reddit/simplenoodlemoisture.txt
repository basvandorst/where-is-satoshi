You don't lose it if you don't sell.

Buying with the app going bonkers is reckless, Chief.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:46:34
Hey.. well... Sometimes we need a good laugh.
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:22:52
Nope go on your coinbase app, buy them, then transfer them to the hardware wallet you purchased seperate.
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:34:51
Yeah that doesn't make sense to me. The language used or the plan.
@_date: 2017-11-18 04:00:10
Have Scoops, bring whatever. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:38:08
No lol
@_date: 2017-11-17 16:53:08
Yeah this stuff doesn't bother me at all. In fact I love a good dip.

Was able to buy around 8800 while going 85 down the highway. Reckless.. on both counts.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:10:15
Dude nobody knows. Either play or don't. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:11:49
Buy when you can and don't expect or wait for dips. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 02:10:58
Wow awesome strategy hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:47:53
Had a fun laugh tonight though, didn't you?

His accounts are at zero lol

Coinbase is fine to use. Get a hardware wallet to store your coins on though. The Ledger S is fine.
Don't think though, don't wait, just buy.

Right I'm just wondering what prompted him to ask anyway
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:20:51
Do you want to pay for people who won't handle their own shit? It's literally giving up for most of these people. Day labor isn't something they want to do. It's pure laziness.

-"I'm not mentally ill.  I have no physical disabilities.  I'm just down on my luck.  I have vast employment gaps.  I don't have a bachelors degree (associates I do have but we can be honest and say it's just as worthless as a high school degree). "-
 All over this country there are day labor positions. I've worked with temp agencies all over in the past 2 years, and there aren't even enough people to push brooms. Your sob story is your creation. You'd do anything for advancement, but you won't do that, eh? You created your problems. You can easily get out of them. Don't make excuses. Don't passive aggressively beg for money on reddit. There's fucking loads of work everywhere. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:44:00
It's not lonely, cuz I'm not up on anything. People all over the country are getting day/week labor positions that become permanent, at $12-$15/hr. If you can't handle that, and you will only accept $20/hr in your preferred field, you don't get to complain. Idk why all of you are enabling this behavior.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:23:54
Also, my "useless high school degree" has been qualification enough for me to easily get myself into an upper middle class position. Your degrees are meaning less and less. Your drive to succeed means a lot more.
@_date: 2018-03-08 17:20:45
I haven't made loads of money from crypto. I have a job that i had to work my way up from the bottom to get at. I hire lots of temp labor people who end up full time for me. Go do that. Dont passive aggresively ask for money on reddit. I may be harsh and cold, but you're a lazy person. Go to work. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 10:42:20
Use a friend's address. Use any fucking address. Employers aren't mailing you paperwork so you can be hired and make money.
@_date: 2018-03-06 04:36:08
I never look down on anyone who decides to learn a skill to better themselves. Learn a decent skill. Don't complain cuz your career as a line cook never took off.
@_date: 2018-03-05 22:18:59
Fucking make one up haha. Biggest myth excuse used by the lazy.
