Just respond with "How much money is in your bank account?".

It's not an excellent post.

Good list, this should be stickied for newcomers (who never read the sidebar or wiki).

It’s pretty simple, just install the [Bitcoin reference client]( [More detailed instructions here]( May take a few hours or days to download the entire blockchain, depending on your internet connection and computer speed, but you only have to do that once and after that it stays sync’d with the network and constantly validates it.

The point is, each time you send one part of the Bitcoin payment, the counterparty sends an equivalent part of the altcoin. If the counterparty fails to deliver any of their parts, you don’t send any more Bitcoin. That way the most you can lose is a fraction of your total payment, like $1400 worth of Bitcoin instead of $14,000.

If his trading strat requires this much constant real-time attention, he should honestly be using bots for that.

You just said a lot of stuff without saying anything at all. If that was intentional you’re a good writer, if it wasn’t you’re not. 
The reason period is superior here is that this poster is not a work of sophisticated literature, rather it’s a short informational item trying to convey the most important points at a glance. 
Simplicity is key. I’ll refer you to [Scott Adams’ treatise on this kind of writing]( particularly the following line:


That’s exactly how that last line is structured. Both colons and semicolons unnecessarily complicate the thought. Period is better in this context.

Because he’s right.

Nope, just Bcash fud.

Sorry for the harsh comment, I know modding subreddits, especially big ones like is a full-time thankless task. I know the mod team and many users share your sentiment, but for reasons it doesn't seem to be the kind of thing that happens of its own volition. It certainly is a clear reminder of the power of economic incentives over human behavior.
@_date: 2019-04-17 23:08:46
Period is better. Neither colon nor semicolon really works exactly right here.

Sounds like you're asking how forks work.  Plenty of good info on this and other technical matters at the [Bitcoin wiki](

Yeah it’s the other way around, the burden of proof is on the one making the assertion.

The narrative that "stagnation" is a bad thing for Bitcoin is overstated.  More often than not, doing nothing is a better strategy than doing something, when the odds of that something being wrong or counterproductive are high, as is the case with most protocol changes to Bitcoin.  As Greg said above, *Bitcoin is fine as it is*.  It could be better, but that's not a requirement for it to maintain a great deal of value.  Maybe people are afraid of "the flippening", but even if that happens, it will likely flip back when Ethereum's even more challenging technical problems begin to surface.
There's an old Japanese proverb:  *"If you sit by the river long enough, you'll see the corpse of your enemy floating by."*  Meaning, often you don't have to do anything at all to 'win', you just have to wait for your adversaries to destroy themselves by making mistakes.  That's quite applicable here.

Also, IPO's only happen after a startup has spent ~10 years building a product, getting traction, and scaling to millions of users or profit.  Most ICO's happen after just the publishing of an obfuscated whitepaper and a website, with little or no evidence the team can actually build anything, much less get users and scale it.
That said, there are a few ICO's that are launching with working testnets and legit teams actually trying to make a real advance in the state of the art of technology, which I'm willing to give the benefit of the doubt and not consider scams by default.

If Bitcoin "should have been" anything other than what it is, it's Mimblewimble, not Monero.

They seem to have [plenty of imagination]( just not enough imagination about *what could go wrong*.  
True cypherpunks and crypto systems engineers seem to have vivid imaginations about the latter and SOP of leaving nothing to chance.

Fwiw this has been a big part of Bitcoin for many years and one of the few, or maybe only, profitable Bitcoin businesses (exchanges &amp; mining).

That is... actually kind of inspiring.  Makes me want to fire up a hex editor and debug some machine code to fulfill my purpose in life.  But I'm sure I will come to my senses momentarily... :D

If you don’t know who Aaron is then you must be new to Bitcoin.  He’s one of the most legit sources in the industry and has been involved since the beginning.  He’s humble, an excellent technical writer, and one of the few must-reads among crypto journalists.
Also his usage of “decentralized” is correct.  There are types of consensus algo, like the ones Google uses, that are leader-driven and thus not decentralized.  Bitcoin and other crypto are by necessity leader-free (or to nitpick they randomly select a new leader every ~10m), and thus are considered decentralized consensus.

My first thought on reading this is, what kind of blockchain?  how will it break?  how will it be hacked or intentionally disrupted?  The article makes no mention of any of this, just more handwavy blockchain bs.
Following the links on LO3's website, we wind up on the [Transactive Grid product page]( which says nothing about how it actually works and provides no links to a Github or even a spec doc.  It mentions "smart contracts" so I assume it's probably a variant of Ethereum, but don't know.
I fear this won't end well.
