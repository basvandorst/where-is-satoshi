So if I money I receive in a paycheck to buy Bitcoins, and then use those Bitcoins to purchase goods/services, I don't think I'm really getting around taxes here. What am I missing?
@_date: 2016-04-05 19:14:31
Unless you're paid in bitcoin, I don't see how it helps tax evasion..

My buddy built this site. I'm a long term HODLer, but this might be a nice resource for traders.

If you don't vote Democrat, you are a Nazi. Duh!

This isn't front page material.
1. Bitcoin wouldn't solve this.
2. Most gyms ONLY accept auto-pay methods.

Man... The articles were painting this guy as such a rude, shut-in. This video really made me feel for him.

Not at all. We're going to act like people are peacefully taking part in voluntary trade. You know, like the tweet said?

Well... I've lost the bidding war. Didn't realize that the timer adds another hour after each bid. Went from $1250 to $2100 in minutes. Congrats!

That's because $2k is a steal for the work you've already done, not to mention the value of the remaining inventory included (assuming a modest 30% markup). I had a $2.1k limit and I stuck with it, so congrats to the new owner! 
It went for $2,550 IIRC.

Black market weapons can be a peaceful transaction.
As far as the murder-for-hire business is concerned, my understanding is that this is mostly a scam. You'll "hire" a hitman, he'll steal your money and nothing happens. Are there any articles about a successful silkroad hit?
EDIT: In case has any confusion, I'm in no way denying the existence of these sections. I am doubting the legitimacy and impact of them.

Why do they call it Ovaltine?

You know damn well he meant "knot".

I believe Ally has unlimited ATM fee reimbursements.

Okay sure, but can we play any of those scenarios out fully? Take Real Estate deeds. These exist today, albeit with very high transaction costs. I'm not sure reduction of transaction cost is sufficient to justify rearchitecting the status quo.

This was my first thought as well. Common sense tells us not to plug random USB drives into our machines.

Mr. Robot needs a wider audience.

I want to do something like this as well, but my guess is that the consensus would be against storing coins longterm on Coinbase. 
@_date: 2016-09-19 18:50:59
Someone more knowledgeable should certain step in and correct me, but if I had to guess, it's less about the amount and more about the principle. What if instead you had $200/day going into the account and $73,000 at the end of the year? Mt. Gox got hacked and shit disappeared. Part of Bitcoin's appeal is the ability to control the security of your money. Having it sit at Coinbase is not control.

Gotcha. It's tempting after seeing what friends get out there, but holy hell is it cold in the winter.

A chart wouldn't give any more credibility than the baseless claim given.
@_date: 2019-01-22 20:30:37
Where is that?
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:23:00
Yes, some might. But the majority might do the opposite. You can't know what will happen.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:06:11
Yes, stocks and mutual funds. Both more secure for most first worlders than cryptos.
@_date: 2015-09-29 21:26:58
And you're better off for it, believe me.
@_date: 2017-10-18 04:04:21
Not sure if you're serious, but there is a huge risk for Bitcoin when the stock market corrects. I hope it doesn't happen, but it's entirely possible for panic selling to hit Bitcoin too. People might pour money into cryptos during a market crash, but they might also pull out.

This bothered me so much. If you can code a song to play triggered by an action, you can code your rig toggle too. This was stupid.

His character is smarter than that.
@_date: 2018-04-11 15:04:53
What I meant to say was that his character is more clever than that. Like when he hacked an entire platform (i.e. the smart fridge). Clearly he likes being a troll, this just seemed beneath him.
@_date: 2016-05-24 18:40:59
But let's be honest, you walk out with the item and your CC payment somehow fails/doesn't confirm later. Unlike with BTC, CC allows them to track you down, right?

[The Great Simoleon Caper]( is even more similar. It's literally a short story about cryptocurrency.
