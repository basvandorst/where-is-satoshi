It's not a payment method currently. It's internet gold.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:26:12
Depends on the country, but where I'm from the 5k in bitcoins is considered wealth, just like a car.
@_date: 2017-08-28 23:23:36
Why is discovery time a problem? It'll just increase the price of already mined coins as new ones are becoming less and less accessible.

Thanks again.
I'm still very new to this. Where can I read more about these central nodes, LN and all these other fun things?
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:23:29
Which is the point. The ones who wants fast and cheap transactions can go with one chain while me and other people can follow core chain.

I doubt bitcoin will ever be used widely for buying toasters. I see it's more as equivalent to gold. So I don't see the need really.

I might belong in the beginner part of bitcoin subs, but isn't the whole point of bitcoin for it to be decentralized, without "people in control"? 
And it's open source, so anyone could make the necessary modifications and start using it? If it's a great modification that is really needed then all of us would jump aboard the great new modification and we would all be happy... right?
I just don't quite understand why people seem upset that "the obvious" solution has resistance. If there is resistance then it might not be very obvious that it is the best solution. 
@_date: 2017-08-24 07:24:51

Thanks for the details. Yeah, I've noticed he didn't like it very much, heh.
But from what I gather... anyone can set up a central node - right? So I don't quite see how that is a problem. 
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:10:34
What is the definition of market share? If you take look at the number of people involved in the crypto-market as a variable then you at least get a relevant metric. Your "stunt" involving two people is therefore quite low on the ladder.

Compare it to gold. Gold is valuable, but isn't used for much. Sure, some of it is jewelry, but a lot of it is just used for HODL-purposes like BTC is.

@_date: 2017-08-28 11:56:34
I'm perfectly okay with them doing this. Paying for their good name and reputation is worth it in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:57:28
I am well aware. It is impossible not to be aware if you pop your head into this sub for a bit. But it is not a problem for me - at all. So why should I be upset? And there is a lot of people just like me. If there is no problem then there is nothing to fix.
The ones who do have a problem should fix it with a fork, so I can be happy on my side of the fork and you can be happy on your side of the fork. Why the need for us to stay together when we want different things?
@_date: 2017-08-28 21:48:45
But why would people think we have reached the top either way?
@_date: 2017-08-28 00:24:04
My point is that given the times, the topic of the tread you posted in and the amount of hostility and toxic waste surrounding the forks you must have had some idea what sort of reaction you were going to get. And when those reactions actually do come it makes me wonder why you start to question them. Did you really expect your comment to be left alone?
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:43:40
Crypto "investing" is probably the most high-risk thing in the horizon right now. It can go anywhere, and you might invest in the wrong fork and so on. It's gambling at this point in time. Ten years down the line we'll see something more stabilized I'm sure, but any attempt at structure or systems in this environment is close to impossible. 
Sell low, buy high.
@_date: 2017-08-23 07:46:52
BTC, index funds and real estate.
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:52:05
It's good that the ones who wanted what bcash could give them went with bcash, and they left bitcoin alone. Both currencies have increased in value since the fork, and less people are unhappy with the current state of affairs of "their" coin. 
If people want different things then they *can* do so. 
How is it bad?
@_date: 2017-08-21 08:40:37
Who are "all the miners" really?
@_date: 2017-08-28 20:24:48
We all know that.
If they manage then bitcoin was never meant to be. Then it's too weak. Time to go back to the drawing board.
@_date: 2017-08-23 17:20:36
What does it matter really? Isn't it great that you can buy and mine the one you prefer? Part of crypto currency is the freedom that comes with it.
@_date: 2017-08-23 00:01:52
I really have no clue what point it is you're trying to make.
@_date: 2017-08-31 06:03:04
Oh? You've seen many of them on your daily strolls?
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:52:30
I don't know. It's not at all important to me. Why do you bring it up?
@_date: 2017-08-28 13:55:13
You are not saying why it sucks.
If you have a disagreement in the community then it makes sense to fork it and let the communities go in their own direction. 
One of the forks will become the major one no matter what, but as long as people think "their" coin is the right one for them then I don't see why it is bad.
@_date: 2017-08-22 06:01:11

No, I don't want that, but I also do not not want that. I don't care where the hash rate hops. I kinda want the ones trying to control bitcoin to bite over more than they can chew though. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:35:52
Yes. I don't see what's wrong with another altcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 09:06:25
What am I looking at on your URL?
@_date: 2017-08-29 00:36:26
Maybe you should fork it then.
@_date: 2017-08-28 14:03:00
I am not sure. Bitcoins is only based on the number of bitcoin available to each user. There are about 16.5 million coins mined, and the remaining coins are increasingly more and more difficult to mine, but the number of people who want in on the market keeps increasing.
There are two small problems with this though. The amount of coins doubled when bcash came around. And so it will be when segwit2x comes along. But one of the forks will be the majority one, and is the one that will have the high price.
The price did increase when bcash came out, so I am guessing something similar will happen when segwit2x comes as well.
There is the possibility that the run up to segwit2x has people running scared and sell their coins they have already made a profit on for less than the current price perhaps, but there are those who will buy as many as they can in the run up to try to duplicate the price increase we saw with the introduction of bcash.

A currency should do exactly that in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:21:48
Sounds like a currency. Are you aware that dollar bills are also a store of cotton, linen and ink? And they can be used as building materials if need be?

Subsystems in a system makes it part of the system. My point was to not make the defence mechanism the people, but rather built into the system. Either directly or as a submodule.

@_date: 2017-11-07 16:05:30
The point is that the defence should be part of the system, built into it. Not a separate thing, because then all you have is a weak system that *will* break at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:30:56
It's not backed by my government, but probably by the US government. 
But the difference between what exactly? The example above is just to show that most currencies are more than just a currency. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:37:02
No clue - I can't for the life of me see that it'll happen. But if everyone decided they wanted Bitcoin Cash for some obscure reason and the price plummets, and people panic, and so on. Then it might happen.
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:12:59
Sure, but let's build a system that does not need defending. If the system needs help this early in its development then it will have a weak foundation. Let it be attacked - hard. And if it breaks we will fix it so that it can withstand the next hit without problems. These attacks are nothing compared to what will happen when the banks and countries actually become worried.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:04:07
So show them. The blockchain is right there.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:38:21
I absolutely agree. The thing I like about bitcoin compared to fiat is the set limitation of 21 million. Other than that it is fairly similar.
@_date: 2017-11-06 13:55:13
one in 31 trillion.
@_date: 2017-11-06 22:36:47
No need to take me seriously - I have zero to none impact on the outcome of this. But I still feel that way about it all. 
I get the feeling you're quite hostile about this though. I can't really understand why. Like I said; I'm just some guy.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:27:22


I don't know if that is a thing.
Magic does not exist though. Even if you think it does.
I don't have a dog.
I am not sure if I quite understand you quite literally. But I believe you are trying to say Bitcoin needs defenders. I disagree with you there to be honest. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:34:00
So let's make one!
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:41:33
But Bitcoin is still in it's early days - right? So even if it's not weak it is not strong enough to take on everything that it needs to take on in the future. My point is that instead of panicking now and trying to protect it from an attack we should let the attack happen and just fix it after it's done so that another attack just like it won't hurt it. We won't know how all of this plays out until after it has happened. This is still an experiment. It has gone live, but it is still an experiment. And they can't go wrong. They can only sometimes give us unexpected results that did not go as we wanted.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:26:38
I don't have much of a point in this. But you are right. I don't get a say - I was just curious why you were so (unnecessarily) hostile. The answer you gave is that Bitcoin is very important to you. Important enough to be openly hostile towards other people that have a different opinion about Bitcoin than you. If we are actually going to have this discussion then my two bits is that such an outlook on life is a terrible thing. I don't have anything more to say than that.
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:30:28
I see it more as an attack on Core than Bitcoin to be honest. That's the effect if 2x does succeed. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:54:07
No, a bunker defends the content from bombs, rockets and grenades in an excellent way.

I can't understand how this could be a problem. You either bought it or mined it. Both should be simple as fuck to prove.

Such as?
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:22:40
I think so too. But let's say that both 1x and 2x dies because of this. Then we are all without any Bitcoins. At least any bitcoin of value. Then that chain does not have the right to live the way I see it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:36:28
Perhaps, but why even make comments like that? Do you not have better things to do than tell idiots on the internet what you think of them?
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:49:38
No preference from me. 
If they really wanted the job they would have done so. It seems Jeff Garzik is the only one currently.
If 2x become the dominant chain then I think we'll see similar coups in the future - so maybe it'll be one of those guys at a later point in time.
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:24:05
No clue. Why? You applying?
@_date: 2017-11-07 23:34:48
That is *one* way to do it. I am just saying there is an alternative route. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:29:00
Yes, this is true.
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:12:56
Seriousness is up to the individual. 
You do not get a say in what is serious **for me** or not. Just in the same way I do not get a say in what you should do with your life either. We both have the freedom to think and mean whatever we want.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:53:10
Are you saying you never use fiat or depend on it? I am not so lucky. The majority of my money is definitely in fiat. One day I might have enough to let go though. I hope we both can achieve that.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:59:34
Because if I don't Bitcoin will still be there.
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:44:30
Bitcoin is a great store of value.
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:26:48

Hehe, what an interesting turn of events. Life goes on then :)
@_date: 2017-11-08 16:21:15
Why so hostile though?
@_date: 2017-11-08 07:24:53


@_date: 2017-11-06 18:30:25
Seems to be Jeff Garzik for now, but I really don't see 2x actually managing that whole thing that it wants to do.
I don't see how Core couldn't continue working on their developments just with a new lead though.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:11:02
Silly. 
@_date: 2017-09-12 11:21:51
Sure, but when? Money has been used for quite a while now, but we all know it too will be replaced.
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:20:39
Sure, but it is an investment. I am even more sure that with the current price of Bitcoin they do not lose money on "wasting" 20 bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-09-12 08:01:51
The point still stands. Buffett doesn't understand bitcoin so he does not invest in it.
@_date: 2017-09-23 11:22:40
You just made that up, didn't you? Or do you have market research or other credible sources to prove this? It would be an interesting read if so. A WSJ-article or similar is not a credible source.
@_date: 2017-09-15 22:58:21
Microsoft Excel.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:49:09
I share your concern, and I absolutely see bitcoin more as commodity than currency but there is one market where it actually seems to be thriving as a currency and that is with regards to buying drugs online.
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:59:54
These price changes are relatively small. Don't think much caused them.

@_date: 2017-09-17 21:58:55
Because it was first.
@_date: 2017-09-21 14:22:01
How? They just did it with some code.
@_date: 2017-09-04 13:33:32
I am a bit uninformed, but my concerns are:
1. AFAIK it become increasingly more difficult to mine coins. We also need miners to verify transactions. What happens when there are too many users (transactions) and not enough miners around? For miners to stick around the transactions need to have high fees.
2. Lack of vendors that accept bitcoin. Due to transaction time and fees it is difficult to accept bitcoin as payment for products or services. I understand that it is good for holding, but I am unsure what happens if we give up on the dream of a digital currency and are only left with digital gold.
@_date: 2017-09-21 17:05:59
You too thanks.

@_date: 2017-09-14 22:15:03
Final demand? Currently it's as volatile as it can get. Can't use it seriously as currency then, but you can do so ideologically.
I like tax and I will pay the tax I'm supposed to. You do you.
No one is obligated to take your bitcoins from you. They're yours. Do what you want with them.

It will happen when you use bitcoin more often than USD. If you get your salary in bitcoin, and webshops don't accept visa, and your supermarket gives you a discount when paying with bitcoin. When you travel other places in the world and it is more convenient to use bitcoins than your MasterCard.
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:49:04
Does this mean miners will have a problem getting rid of their coins?
@_date: 2017-09-13 10:50:41
I don't think that's true. Someone is selling at lower and lower prices, so something is happening.
@_date: 2017-09-06 07:54:13
But when it makes more sense to mine than just buying coins yet people buy coins is when we have an actual bubble going.

I believe there are about 1700 bitcoins created per day. If "China" mines 80% of all bitcoins, then 10-20 isn't really a bit cost.

You do not understand what corrections means.
@_date: 2017-09-19 08:43:28


Correct. This is a good thing though. In order for a currency to dethrone another currency it needs to have belief from users. The belief comes from offering something the other can not. If another cryptocurrency becomes bigger than bitcoin it means it had something better than bitcoin, and we should absolutely use that.
The problem with fiat is the monopoly on it. Just printing more on a whim. I'm okay with banks buying as much bitcoin as they could. With all the "HODLers" it still would not give the banks the same monopoly as they have today. 
And if they managed to buy every last one then it would be worthless to anyone else and a new $hitcoin would dethrone bitcoin.

I'm asking you about those extremely suitable conditions. I'm asking about what price do you believe it would be more profitable to Mina than just buy and hold. 
In reality it would be difficult to find such a price because China miners would keep the price down, but my point is that there exists a price of coin when it's more sensible to mine than buy. If we go above that price we enter the land of bubbles. So what is that price?

Want to know an easy way to not have your problem?
Don't "invest" more than you can afford to lose.
Consider the bitcoin investment as gone the second the fiat leaves your fiat account. It's Monopoly money that most likely will grow to a bigger number than now, but it'll be a rocky road until it does.

I struggle to see how Bitcoin can have any "real" value beyond what we give it. It doesn't have any purpose other than to be held, and occasionally be used for some niche market like onion drugs-sites. 
So I don't see how there can be a Bitcoin bubble. 
A housing bubble exists when there are too many available places to live compared to people needing a place to live. 
There can't be too many Bitcoins compared to people wanting to put money into it. There is a finite amount of Bitcoins as well, so at some point there will be no more that will be mined. Then we will only have to existing coins to be traded. And currently it is getting increasingly more difficult to get coins from mining.

When a fork happens, like the one that will come in November, you double your bitcoins because you keep the ones you have on the original coin, but they are duplicated on the new fork.

Bitcoin is a unit of measurement. All the bitcoins are in a blockchain. In the blockchain it says who owns each bitcoin. This means you never really have the bitcoins - you just have a key that lets you assign new ownership of your bitcoins. Not all bitcoins have an owner yet. 
The act of mining is both (1) the act of assigning an owner of non-owned bitcoins, and (2) the act of transferring ownership from one person to another. It's done by doing complex mathematics to solve an increasingly more difficult equation.
Price of bitcoin is just based on supply and demand. Very similar to gold. Bitcoins can be bought and sold on an exchange. 
China is trying to prevent cryptocurrency chaos within China and has (3) decided to ban ICOs, which is *one* scheme to introduce new cryptocurrencies, and also (4) they intend to regulate exchanges where cryptos are bought and sold.

Why do you think it's a bubble? What regulates the price of Bitcoins? What is the real price Bitcoin should be at, and why is it that exact price?
As the price of mining goes up, due to energy needs and hardware cost, it makes sense to see an increase in price right? Anything above the cost of energy and hardware is speculation. But speculation is part of the game. We see it with currencies all the time, gold, stocks, and housing market.
Of course we are fan boys. Early adopters is a synonym of fan boy. Everyone is not even close to buying bitcoins. Do you really know what you're talking about or are you just scared of missing out?

I don't know about the US, but here the only tax is the delta on what you actually gained. So if you spend $1000 and sell them for $1500 you're taxed for 24% of $500. That includes fees. Basically the difference between what went out of your account and what came back.

In the housing market or stock market price can sometimes be based more on psychological factors than actual value. When there is a sudden boom in price this is often true, so when some time goes by the price drops down to the actual value it is more healthy than an inflated price.
I don't know if the same principle applies to bitcoin, but I'm certain this is what they mean.

The bigger bitcoin become the bigger probability of agreements with governments becomes. Now there's a lot of people who deal with bitcoin specifically because they want to crush the control governments have over money. But a lot of people don't have any interest in that. They just want to have money in a secure and predictable way. They don't care if the government does that for them. They probably expect them to. So there's no doubt in my mind that governments will become involved with bitcoin at some point and that some sort of agreements between countries regarding bitcoin will be in place. They could easily set up their own fork.
But even so... there was an actual HK agreement, but it wasn't followed for whatever reason.

It seems like [this]( is the so called HK agreement, and I see that from Core it was Cory Fields, Johnson Lau, Luke Dashjr, Matt Corallo and Peter Todd. As Core isn't a company I guess it's difficult to get them to agree to something as there isn't really anyone around to make an agreement with. The developers can write the code, but there is no sure way to ensure it gets implemented.

Price is very relevant. If the cost of coin went to $50,000 today it would be cheaper for you to buy a miner and pay your electric bills as usual than to just buy&amp;hold.
I understand what you are saying though... if the price went to $50,000 everyone would buy miners and the difficulty would go up and everything would fall down.

No, I believe you misunderstand what I am trying to communicate.
Not explaining "why" is "not good".
Step one is saying the client app is closed source. You did this.
Step two is explaining why you think closed source is bad. 
Step three would be telling us if there have been episodes where PIA specifically was caught doing something bad. Sources included.
Based on this people can perhaps be able to make a decision if PIA is okay for them or not.

Tech companies talk more about blockchain than bitcoin. We still talk about p2p file sharing, but not eMule. I don't think the bitcoin-story is very different than the eMule-story, but the fact that a lot of people have invested a lot of money in bitcoin might make it a bit more resilient.

People mine new coins every day. That means supply is ever increasing.
If there were more and more people wanting bitcoin then demand would also be increasing. 
At some point there will be less new bitcoins available for the new buyers. At that point price will increase. I don't get the feeling were there yet, but I'm convinced that day will come.

Large blocks does not mean centralization in itself. It just so happens that companies want big blocks. If they get everyone to follow them on that the following happens: the software developers that write new features into the bitcoin code is controlled by these companies. 
The current set of software developers (called "Core") are independent. And that's good for decentralization.

With crypto exchanges that deal with more than one crypto it doesn't really matter which one is the leading one. You can use bitcoins for one thing and ethers for something else, and just swap one for the other when in need. It would not surprise me to see wallets with this function in the future.

What about this fork coming up? Does it play into things somewhat? You think prices will drop or rise in that aspect?

You mean places like You should try to expand your horizon a bit. A sheltered life is probably nice and cosy, but when you are exposed to such vile experiences as men commenting on pictures of girls they find attractive the struggle can become too real.
Cheer up a bit. This is what life is like.

You don't seem content with the comments you complain about, but perhaps that's just one of my assumptions. It's good that you can clarify this for us all now though, because I don't think everyone thinks you're content with those comments.
We both assume things about each other, me about you being sheltered and you telling me I have no idea what life really can be like and how sad that is.
For some reason you can't accept that men will very often make comments about women that some find funny and others find nasty. 
Have you never been to some place outside Reddit where men make comments about women that looks like the comments in this thread? Then I would say you're very selective about who you associate yourself with, and I would say my assumption about you being sheltered is correct. 
It seems to me that you're too caught up in what **social** life *can* be, than how it actually is. They say the world needs dreamers; so good for you on being that guy. 
I know the rest of us don't always agree with your vision for how things ought to be, but when you have these creative and good ideas about **justice** and fairness we all cheer with you. 
If you work on your communication skills a bit then the rest of us might understand your dreams of the future a bit better as well. Then you don't have to worry about making us so frustrated and confused as you do now. Become a communication **warrior**, and prosper.
If I see your comments again I'll be sure to keep all of this in mind.
Good night! :)

No, they're done by a very small minority. It's not even on most people's thoughts during the average month.

I believe you've invested more than you can afford to lose. 
Transfer some euros back to your account and use it to pay for therapy. Consider the remaining euros lost, and just keep them in BTC.
Sleep more.
