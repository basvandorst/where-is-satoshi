The problem is Uber, Lyft, etc are being banned by cities where they are stepping on too many toes, namely the Taxicab cartels.

Let me guess, change how Bitcoin works so that it is agreeable for legitimacy in the eyes of the state.
Some people don't give a fuck about legitimacy in the eyes of the state. And if people like you somehow weasel your way into getting bullshit changes into Bitcoin's code, thats what forking is for. Cats out of the bag buddy, get used to it.

My first purchase was a bit over $1050. I'd been following it for years, believe in the technology, and just then got the guts to buy one.

Let me ask you, you are having a direct interface with what is probably one of bitcoin's core communities. The reaction to your changes is overwhelmingly negative. Why do you think it is a good, or even right thing to try to push through?

Goddamn it I had this exact idea a few days ago. In St. Louis we are going through the same thing with Lyft.
I was thinking something mimicking OpenBazaar. Driver rating pages, passenger ratings, driver ads, passenger ads, etc. All made possible by bitcoin, litecoin, dogecoin, etc.
I'd really like to be a part of anyone that wants to (or looks like they are already, lazooz) make this happen.

Tell me how you reconcile giving the government yet more control over communication technology, with using a technology expressly designed to challenge that control, and with that government being already proven completely hostile to privacy and security?
I know the rhetoric about "evillll corporations" is alluring, and it is true, to an extent. Corporations lobby and win local monopolies on using municipal rights of way. There can be no compeition in such a system.
A REAL solution, since you guys seem to want to rely upon government to come save your asses (when it has only been fucking them), is to create, pass, and enforce legislation that would require rights of way to service at least 4-5 ISP's.
The current "solutions" to the current problem really just amount to spreading those cheeks even wider, baby. Nevermind that "egalitarianism" is not what the internet is about, not even at it's most fundamental level. 
*Networks don't work that way.*
But by all means, spread em for the government, man. Use bitcoin, while giving the government even more power over the core networks bitcoin operates upon. Advocate for more government control, while giving the government power to influence what you see and come into contact with to an almost unlimited extent.
You know what they say about doing the same thing and expecting different results?
@_date: 2014-02-07 18:06:39
Regulation is written by already established corporations to burden potential competitors. You're a big corp, a small fine or regulation or whatever will make you look good to the public, and also make it financially or otherwise unfeasable for a competitor to either start up or remain in business. You can afford it, they cannot. Its an extremely worthwhile trade off. Its the exact thing that is happening with Private practice in the United States. Who wrote the healthcare bill? Insurance companies and big hospital corporations. Who is getting fucked? Private practice. Who is the primary competitor to hospitals? Private practice. Who can't afford all these ridiculously unnessesary regulatory changes? Private practice. Who can? Large hospitals and insurance companies.
There is a reason "regulations" are written by large corporations.

Never said you have to like it. It is simply good courtesy to not trash talk the people (yes, even Satoshi) that made bitcoin what it is. Also a good idea to recognize the effects of bitcoin are specifically planned to bring about the obsolescence of the state.
If you associate the state with "everything we know", that's your problem, not bitcoins, and not the ancaps.

Ever read Satoshi's works? Ever familiarized yourself with those nasty icky libertarian thoughts you hate? Those two goals are one and the same.


States, have been forced to shrink for millennia now. Seems to correlate pretty strongly with technological progress. I guess our grandchildren will get to find out who's right ;)
