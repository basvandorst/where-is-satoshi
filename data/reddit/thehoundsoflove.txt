I don't take the opinions of someone who doesn't believe in climate change seriously
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:00:41
Wait which point did I miss? Tell me more about your experience being in 1930s Germany. Oh wait, it's just you being a whiny baby *about Bitcoin* pretending it has anything to do with one of the greatest tragedies in the world! *cry more*
@_date: 2018-08-13 00:17:14
Wow you just made it even more awkward....
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:06:14
"why are you so opposed to other opinions (besides your own) being expressed on here?"
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:27:14
He deletes/edits his comments and posts all the time lol
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:03:04
Funny how you proclaim popular new sources as "fake news", yet you expect me to click that link
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:30:17
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:42:52
lol k
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:15:20
Interesting how you use Huffpo as a source when it says what you want to hear, after how much you claim it's Fake News
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:26:41
hilarious, based on your post history
@_date: 2018-08-13 17:40:25
uhh why do you keep trying to make this sexual? You're really, really awkward.
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:36:20
lol yup
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:50:38
Nah I just think it's super creepy that you think Bitcoin can be compared to the Holocaust 
@_date: 2018-08-13 18:00:43
How cringey. No wonder everyone thinks you're a troll. 
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:57:58
It's super creepy that you've stooped to bringing up the Holocaust
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:55:22
your emojis really validate your comparison of Bitcoin to the Holocaust, nice work
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:05:28
Nah I'll say it again, It's super creepy that you're comparing Bitcoin discussions on Reddit to *The Holocaust*.
@_date: 2018-08-14 22:37:39
Don't forget he compared his opinions being unpopular here to repression of Jewish people in Nazi Germany...
@_date: 2018-08-07 22:59:10
*of course* you think global warming is a "fraud"....
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:45:30
He also changes his race and age when necessary lol
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:25:27
lol @ the climate change denier who compared Bitcoin to the Holocaust 
@_date: 2018-08-15 21:39:28
Please quote where I made fun of bleach baths
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:29:01
Lol yup I'll be sure to be "valueing the opinions" of someone who brought up the Holocaust in regards to Bitcoin
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:42:21
lol you brought up Germans oppressing Jewish people in a discussion about *Bitcoin*
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:38:36
What I'm saying is it's funny that you ignore "fact based" links for your own opinions. I'm not debating the existence of climate change with you. 
@_date: 2018-08-08 00:11:13
Funny that you feel ~attacked~ when you're the weirdo who brought up *The Holocaust*   
Also I was quoting you lol
@_date: 2018-05-02 17:51:28
[Ghee99 agrees with you](
@_date: 2018-08-12 17:27:09
this is such an awkward comment
@_date: 2019-11-15 18:37:52
He also has quite a few equally insufferable alts
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:17:33

@_date: 2019-04-08 00:13:38

fighting with his alts

@_date: 2018-11-28 23:18:10
He's an awkward dude to say the least lol
@_date: 2018-11-17 03:25:42
awkward as usual 
@_date: 2018-04-12 15:15:20
UPDATE: CVS has announced that it will no longer require photo identification to be shown in order for customers to buy nail polish *remover* in most states.     
@_date: 2018-04-11 23:37:53


@_date: 2018-04-12 16:43:26
It was never for nail polish
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:30:50
Hmm that's definitely the reaction of someone who's willing to defend their opinions- go ahead and block them! 
@_date: 2018-12-06 05:37:33
Don't forget @_date: 2018-12-05 05:34:22
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:10:26
Are you.. quoting yourself repeatedly? Lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:20:25
lol how awkward of you
@_date: 2018-12-05 05:41:46
All your editing and deleting has never worked lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 04:05:33
Lol now you're worried about finding me a man? Awkward!
@_date: 2018-12-04 01:44:01
both his alts (and are 50% deleted/edited content lol
@_date: 2018-12-12 03:36:59
Lol as if quoting yourself wasn't awkward enough, then you made this comment...
@_date: 2018-12-05 06:16:13
All I'm saying is that you and your alts are very obvious and undeletable :)
