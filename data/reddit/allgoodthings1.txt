That's the reason for requiring an up-front investment in SJCX before one can get paid for farming (renting) out their extra storage. In Test Group B, the required up-front money was 10,000 coins - or about $200 when I bought mine. *Skin in the game* goes a long way toward keeping out the "shits and giggles."

Bug or no bug, what does it matter? Is that a problem for you? If it is, just cancel and place the order again, no? Or are you just tinkering with the system to see what happens, and report to the world about all the perceived bugs you find? Maybe there's a good explanation for the behavior you're reporting. Have you asked Purse about it?

Mainly.. If you pay for an order in bitcoin and *for any reason* you need a refund, both of them refuse to give you *anything* except an in-store credit. No refund by check, or ACH, or credit card, or PayPal, or bitcoin. Your money is theirs. They refuse to give it back for any reason. You have to use the credit to buy something else with them alone. It's right in their TOS agreements. 
No responsible merchant would even think of having a policy like this for credit card, PayPal, or check payments. But these companies know your bitcoin payment cannot be reversed, so they jump on that fact to take you and it hostage.

Thanks for the reminder about that blog page of the $10K match. I need to bookmark that to share later with others. I usually donate to Kaya through their BitPay portal, so I can get a tax receipt. Recently I had some ChangeTips to share with them and just sent them to their static address. I was pleased to see they've had a lot of smaller donations sent there, too. I've not found any charity more pro-active of bitcoin donations than is Kaya.

Unless you're using a foreign custodian for your bitcoin, you don't have a foreign account. Bitcoin is an global asset, not one of any one country, *per se*. So if you're holding your bitcoin in your own wallet, it's not in a foreign account that needs to be declared.

They just started accepting bitcoin payments several weeks ago. 
Now they're giving an *extra discount!* for paying in bitcoin – that is, above their already great discounts on many gift cards!
Let's say “Thanks” by giving them some business.
@_date: 2015-12-21 17:54:20
Oh, yes. It's right there on checkout. Click the payment with bitcoin option, and it automatically adds the 3% discount for you.
@_date: 2015-12-08 23:50:54
The problem is with valuing bitcoin. That is, the bitcoin to fiat ratio, or conversion rate. It's not static. It changes moment by moment. It looks like it decreased in value while you were making the transfer. The difference has nearly nothing to do with the transaction fee. Coinbase doesn't charge anything for deposits. So the only bitcoin fee was the one you mention.
@_date: 2015-12-30 21:40:26
If you're referring to bitcoin held in your Coinbase account.. no, you can't back them up. You can, however, secure them a bit more by putting them in a Coinbase Vault account.
You can't back up holdings in your regular Coinbase account because they're not *your* coins. They're Coinbase's coins held in your ledger account. You don't hold the private keys.

You can get your Walmart cards cheaper on CardFlip cardflip.com
When they're available (as they are this morning), they're usually about 2.25% discount PLUS another 3% for paying with bitcoin. And, you can speed up delivery by requesting E-Cards (instead of plastic) and get delivery in less than a day.  This is how I've been buying Walmart cards for a long time now.
Of course, you can usually find them on CardCash.com too - though the net discount is less. CardCash gives 2% off listed prices for bitcoin payments.
@_date: 2015-12-11 02:26:45
Somehow, you're not looking where you should be.  The 5% discount is for their Purse Instant program they rolled out a while back. But the legacy Name Your Discount program is still right there like it's always been. And it still lets you set a discount as high as 50%.

It’s no secret that merchant adoption is outpacing consumer adoption. We firmly believe that a lack of consumer incentive is the main reason for slow adoption, but friction in the bitcoin checkout flow does not help. Despite lower processing fees, accepting bitcoin could be bad decision for most merchants unless the experience is improved.*
At the crux of the UX problem, bitcoin transactions are designed to “push” payments, similar to a wire transfer. “Pull” transactions like recurring billing or Amazon’s famous “1-click” checkout were seemingly impossible for bitcoin. note: the white paper does not mention “QR codes”
Today, we’re proud to announce Snap that enables a “1-click” experience with Bitcoin. That’s right. No more manual bitcoin transfer required. Simply connect through Coinbase and “Enable Snap” on your next checkout. With Instant and Snap together, Bitcoin shopping couldn’t be any easier. Start saving today!
*Merchants who accept both credit cards and bitcoin cite low bitcoin usage. But worse, most cite much lower conversion rates that makes accepting bitcoin a costly decision. For example, if 10% of checkouts elect bitcoin and convert only 25% compared to 70% conversion for a credit card, shopping cart abandonment costs (4.5%) outweigh the savings on interchange (2.0%).

Maybe you should blow that horn on your web site a bit? I like the caveat you put on the Bitcoin News page  - about how you handle refunds when required. I guess you'll be adding a more permanent section on that page to tell about the extra 2% discount.
It's really cool that now anyone can get a turn around with your e-cards as fast as we're used to getting already with Gyft or eGifter. And your 'extra 2%' trumps their 3% on nearly everything - usually by a SUBSTANTIAL margin! Great work! Thanks.
@_date: 2015-12-13 01:03:56

I'm not sure. The cards come in a pdf format. On each card there's instruction text, the card value, number and pin, plus a bar code. But there's no QR code.I should think.. as long as you can display the pdf file to the store clerk, they should be able to even manually enter the card number and pin, or scan the bar code.

**GREAT** alternative to Gyft and eGifter! These old standards only give a 3% discount with purchase payments in bitcoin. CardCash give 2% PLUS often *much* larger discounts on individual cards.
And, if you buy an e-printable card from CardCash, it's delivered to you in seconds!
I've done multiple purchases from CardCash, ever since they began accepting bitcoin several weeks ago. The company is legit, and worthy of our support.

Probably the best way to cap your upload is to limit the number of connections. 8 connections is the max you can get without opening Port 8333.  Open that port and you can get 100 or more.  The first 8 are inbound only. Anything above that is inbound/outbound.  So you can set your maxconnections at anything above 8 and contribute to the network however much you want.
To limit the number of connections, from a command prompt, start the node with 
*&gt;bitcoind -maxconnections=XX*
Of course your hardware and network will limit the number of connections [and hence, bandwidth utilization] on their own.  On my home laptop, the maximum connection I can get without limiting is about 40.  And that's good enough for me, anyway.
That said, running the node with no limiting of bandwidth never clogs up my computer for other network functions. The bitcoin software does a great job of backing off to let other applications take priority for resources.

They use bitcoin to do good, too. There are a lot of non-profits that do. Though of the 3 you mention, only Greenpeace and United Way show you a way to do it on their web sites.

Working at last! I've had Core running on a desktop and a VPS – both with Ubuntu 12.04 – and neither one had updated from the repository since Core 0.10.2 !
I recently corresponded about this with Matt Corallo, the PPA maintainer, and he got it fixed! It worked immediately on my desktop. The VPS installation took this little bit more. The updater would hold back – and not fetch and install - *bitcoind*
Matt wrote: “Try apt-get install libboost-chrono1.48.0 libboost-filesystem1.48.0 libboost-program-options1.48.0 libboost-system1.48.0 libboost-thread1.48.0 and see what you get?” I installed these libraries, then ran *update* and *upgrade*. It worked splendidly!

Not that's up to date and anywhere near complete. No list of companies. No list of charities.  
One of the easiest things in the world that BitPay and Coinbase could do to increase traffic to the sites of their bitcoin partners.. publish lists of who they are.. so *aficionados* like many of us could go directly to those sites with our business.

No need to buy the gift card through Gyft in Step One. You can pick up a Purse.IO order directly in your Amazon account, paying with your credit card or gift card you have from some other means. You can buy bitcoin this way *all day long* for a premium of 25% or less. I Love Purse!

GREAT new feature! For some time now, I have been immediately replenishing the bitcoin I spend with a purchase from my USD Wallet. [That way I don't have to keep track of each and every transaction for capital gains reporting.] But still it's two transactions instead of one, every time I spend bitcoin. With this new feature, it's not. Just one slick and easy transaction accomplishes everything. Thanks, Coinbase!

I don't know all the rules for the newer Instant program. But with the old NYOD, you were limited to 8% on the first purchase, then you could max out from then on. That is after that first order was confirmed and the escrow cleared to your buyer.  I don't know anything about a 15% max. That must have something to do with the Instant gateway.  And it may just be you have to do a NYOD purchase from just 8% the first time, before you can do it for more. The Instant program is so new, it may still have bugs to work out of it. Once you get over to doing everything with NYOD, you'll never look back.

Yes, when I buy AMZ merchandise specifying a lower discount rate (say, up to 20%) I nearly always get those orders in a couple of days and very seldom have a problem. When I specify higher discounts, I have more delay and more problems. That's just the nature of the beast.
For that order at 45%, I had the order picked up twice by people who didn't complete the requisite payment to Amazon, so the order fell through and I had to reenter it. But the inconvenience is only a slight bother for the very high discount rate I'm reaching for on more non-urgent orders.

In normal blockchain parlance, a supernode of 'full node' is one that accepts incoming connections as well as outgoing. On Bitcoin Core or XT, the regular installation will make up to 8 connections and allow only outgoing connections to other nodes, so the node can keep itself up to date.  You have to open Port 8333 on your network to allow incoming connections, thus enabling a lot more connections and those to support other nodes besides your own. Just open Port 8333 and you're doing all you can.  Depending on your hardware and network specs, you can achieve up to 100 or more connections.

Coinbase will let you set up recurring payments on an account, just like recurring deposits. If your workers are located in countries that have even modest adoption, you should be able to require them to set up each one his/her own bitcoin wallet so you can sent them payments in bitcoin. Those they can then exchange to fiat through whatever mechanism is in their country of residence.

You know.. Hardware wallets like Electrum are really safe and easy to set up. And if a worker doesn't live in a Coinbase-served country, there are other online services available pretty ubiquitously.  If they don't have a local Coinbase type account for getting their bitcoin to fiat, but have an exchange that will serve for that, an exchange account is in fact a sort of wallet you could send wages to.

Working at last! I've had Core running on a desktop and a VPS – both with Ubuntu 12.02 – and neither one had updated from the repository since Core 0.10.2 !
I recently corresponded about this with Matt Corallo, the PPA maintainer, and he got it fixed! It worked immediately on my desktop. The VPS installation took this little bit more. The updater would hold back – and not fetch and install - *bitcoind*
Matt wrote: “Try apt-get install libboost-chrono1.48.0 libboost-filesystem1.48.0 libboost-program-options1.48.0 libboost-system1.48.0 libboost-thread1.48.0 and see what you get?” I installed these libraries, then ran *update* and *upgrade*. It worked splendidly!
Now everyone with Ubuntu 12.02 can once again update from the repository.

I love Purse.IO!  But you can get discounts of up to 50%, not up to 20%. I just had an order picked up for 45% discount, and routinely get them for 30% - delivered in just a week.  It's a great service!

Person with bitcoin wants to buy something from Amazon with a discount. Creates and AMZ Wish List and enters his order on Purse, specifying a desired discount. The lower he sets the discount, the more quickly it is picked up by a buyer. Better for the buyer, but not as good for seller.  Most sellers start at about 20% discount; that is, a 20% premium to the buyer. But there are plenty of sellers asking for (and getting) even more. I'm a frequent seller, and I usually get my orders for 30% picked up by a buyer and delivered pretty quickly.
A bitcoin buyer must start out with a first order of &lt;$50, but can then work up to larger and larger maximums.  
@_date: 2015-06-18 19:11:27
Coinbase and Circle are not exchanges. But - like OP writes - Coinbase will let you do this.. if you can set up a USD Wallet with them. You just set the sale proceeds to go to that account, rather than back to your bank.  Have you checked out the Coinbase Exchange? That is probably a better place to do what your want to do... if you're just trading and not spending from your bitcoin wallet there.

You have to have a bitcoin wallet with the coins in it. He has to have a bitcoin wallet. He has to give you a receiving address for his wallet. You have to send the bitcoins to that address. If the boss has his wallet with Coinbase or Circle, they can cash out the bitcoin directly for him. That's the easiest.  If not, then he'll have to find out how to cash out the bitcoin himself.
@_date: 2015-06-01 22:13:48
I would certainly try it there, or even higher is you're not in a hurry for delivery.  You can always post the order and modify it later to bring down your discount % and get faster pickup.  I've noticed.. I think orders for higher discounts are picked up better when they're smaller. I think that's because the parties picking up the order are often newer buyers to the marketplace, and want to get their feet wet with smaller outlays. I can't say that I blame them. Purse is a bit surreal,  so different than anything else out there.  
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:05:25
LocalBitcoins and BitQuick put your Coinbase or Circle account in pretty serious jeopardy, as OP mentions. Even coins washed though multiple wallets, I'd say.
If you buy your coins at Coinbase/Circle and also buy merchandise from Amazon, Purse.IO is a great service to use -- one that carries no account closure risk with Coinbase, at least. Essentially, you buy Amazon merchandise with a large discount, paying with bitcoin. Someone on the other side of the trade pays for your order with a credit card, gift card, or whatever, and you release the bitcoin to them when your order arrives.
Purse.IO is also a great way for some folks to buy bitcoin at premium rates similar to LocalBitcoins.

Q: Do you have both PCs on the same router? If so, only one of them can a full node be (with incoming requests).
@_date: 2015-06-01 21:58:04
Yeah. I've had great luck at about 35%.  It often takes about a week to get the merchandise, and there are more problems with orders -- that is, with cancelled transactions, since the buyers on the other side of the transaction are often newbies to the marketplace and have not been vetted like those on Instant and those at the lower discounts of NYOD.  But I can suffer the wait and occasional problem well enough, in turn for the much larger discount.

He could also buy stuff from Amazon at LARGE discounts -- and spend his bitcoin through Purse.IO.  Either of these options is better that LocalBitcoins.

10% on Amazon is no big deal here among bitcoiners.. When with Purse.IO you can get at least a 15% discount and the same 2-day Prime delivery. The "Members Only" part is personally off-putting to me, too. Too elitist for my sensibilities.
@_date: 2015-06-10 13:22:18
vnStat is what I use. Suits me well enough.
Of course I check my connections daily with these commands.. *bitcoin-cli getinfo* &amp; *bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo*   Both give you the number of connection your node has; the latter gives you a network score that you will see increase over time. This is a score that other nodes see when they search for a node to connect with; the higher your score, the more likely your node is to get more helpful, active connections to others. This score resets to zero whenever your node is stopped; hence the reason to leave your node on and fully functioning for very extended periods of time.
Caveat: If you're connected to the PPA, your computer will automatically retrieve and install any new version that is released.  However, the older version continues to run until you stop the node and restart it. Most of us probably don't always stop and restart with the new version, every time a minor version update comes along. That way, we can retain the high node score and keep contributing at maximum capacity.  But when there's a major update in the version, you can stop and restart to run with the most recent iteration of the client.

Yes, I agree. It seems like their card inventory fluctuates a lot. But then, so does it on CardCash, which I started using more recently, when they started accepting bitcoin. With CardFlip, I think their inventory issue has a lot to do with their being just a small, local shop.  You'll notice how many of their cards are not national brands.

You mean pay for a Netflix subscription with bitcoin? If so, buy a NF gift card from Amazon through Purse.IO - buy the card for at least a 20% discount if you're not in a hurry. At 10% if you are. I just did it yesterday for the fifth time. Works like a charm.
@_date: 2015-12-12 23:47:43
To be honest, I don't think I've *ever!* read before of someone sliding the discount to extremes in the Modify Order mode. I mean, who does that in real life? You can indeed change the discount with Modify Order. But if you're a serious buyer on Purse, once you've placed your order for your well-considered target discount, you're adjusting it by just a tiny amount, to hopefully get your order picked up more quickly - not slamming the slider to the extremes of scale to see what happens.
@_date: 2015-12-29 22:33:04

You can still use whatever payment mechanism you want with all the other services of Purse. They've just chosen Coinbase for their wallet service provider, and this new program of theirs requires payment from a Coinbase account,too.  I have a Coinbase account that I use sometimes, but I won't be using this new service of Purse. Even if I pay with my Coinbase account, I can forego the 1-click speed and ease and do things the way I always have before.  I never use the Purse Instant program, anyway.  Why get only 5% off Amazon merchandise, when you can get *much higher discounts* and deliveries almost as fast with their flagship Name Your Own Discount protocol.
I think this announcement of Purse does not go far enough to explain exactly how this protocol works, and why one would use it rather than through the systems they already use.
@_date: 2015-06-10 15:06:28
I'm not sure why you would want to do that. Even when there's a bandwidth rush [when some node requests a lot of blocks at one time], bitcoin runs at a low priority and that requests should not interfere with your other use of the computer.

If you look at a large sampling of charities, like the one I maintain here:  - You will see some do give only a bitcoin address and some give both.

Or, then, maybe it's time businesses that choose to take bitcoin -- supposedly for its lower transaction cost and the increase in sales it can bring them.. maybe it's time they step up to the plate and create mechanisms for issuing customer refunds when something goes wrong with orders paid for with bitcoin. Overstock and other companies have done this already. Why should players like *TigerDirect* be any different?  If companies want our bitcoin business, they could at least be fair about it -- not just using bitcoin as a low-cost hook to attract more revenues that then can be locked in house irrevocably.

Your first Name Your Own Discount purchase is limited to 8%, then later purchases you can go clear up to 50%.
Edit: I buy Prime items all the time for 15% discount, and those orders are almost always picked up within minutes and delivered in two days.  My orders for 30% usually come in about a week.

Their web site is pretty clunky, and a lot of things aren't well explained there.  They're rather new to running their card business online, and it seems like they may be understaffed and having trouble keeping up with the volume of business that's come their way.

If you ever buy anything from Amazon, Purse.IO is the perfect answer! You make an order order and your bitcoin payment goes into escrow. Someone picks up your order and pays Amazon for it. When you confirm delivery of the order, Purse releases your bitcoin to the buyer. You have your merchandise; the other party has their bitcoin. The system works very well, and it's not black-balled by Coinbase and Circle, like LocalBitcoins and some other ventures are.

If you look around at even non-bitcoin sites that sell premium coffees [organic/free trade], I think you'll find the only ones that don't charge a similar shipping regimen are ones that charge a lot more for the coffee -- effectively building in the shipping cost to their price.
I like *Tiny* because they have great coffee for a good price, take bitcoin, and do a lot of good environmental and public service work, too.

Apparently.. a failed basic assumption. I'm a supporter of the Outpost's work. But for the sorrow all of us might feel for its present hard times, they were not unpredictable. Any enterprise that *holds* bitcoins donated to meet its social mission is playing with fire. It's simply rolling the dice with someone else's welfare.
The Outpost's finances have been burning since the price highs last year. Their final announcement of trouble is only a capitulation to the truth that's been on their books for several months now. It's really bad the benefactors of the mission's service are the ones that must suffer from the decision to hold bitcoins for possible gain, instead of taking the bird in hand and converting bitcoin donations to fiat at the time of gifting.
For all that I support the Outpost's mission, I don't think its the social obligation of us supporters to give more to bail out a flawed and unchanged policy.  That's truly throwing good money after bad.  Never a good idea.

While we're at it.. Why not add to your web site some good and thorough help menus, to assist especially the real newbies in getting set up and knowing what to expect.  I opened my account over a year ago, when I was one such newbie to bitcoin; and, I remember feeling a bit overwhelmed by the lack of information on your site. I ended up relying more on help I found here on reddit than what was explained to me there.  
And in the past year, not much has gotten better on your site -- even with the huge influx of newbies looking around and asking questions.  It seems to me that Coinbase would be very well served by explaining things better on your web site, and not leaving newbies to take up the time of your CSR's, asking questions that have been asked time and time again by others. And newbies would not be left to ask so many questions here on reddit, where such can provoke as many bitter, negative and insulting responses as helpful ones.

Don't forget, we're talking the human psychology in many different world fiat currencies.  Bitcoin is not like U.S. stocks, traded almost entirely in USD.  So scaled numbers like 350, 375, 400 don't mean much across the spectrum of world buyers and sellers.  What's a round number for Americans is not a round number for Europeans.  Especially not now when the USD has been appreciating markedly against the EUR.

Of course, there is a significant way that merchant adoption HELPS bitcoin price. It brings on more buyer-participants into the ecosystem. After all, if you can't spend bitcoin, why would you buy it? Just to hoard it hoping for a higher price? Ultimately, that's a pretty small universe. Like, the number of people in the world that own stock in a company, compared with the whole rest of the world.

I see you're a Canadian-based charity.  Not too long ago, I saw here a link to a listing of Canadian charities that take bitcoin. Maybe you've seen that, too, and are on that list? I edit a similar list of U.S. charities: 
I think yours is a problem shared by commercial outlets, too. That the bitcoin economy is still *TINY!* with respect to its fiat counterpart, and our constituents are  -- as a group -- perhaps less inclined to charitable giving than the larger universe of people.
We also have the situation where at least one bitcoin charity -- Sean's Outpost -- got a ton of early press and support, and much of that still lingers, distracting attention from the newer small charities that are also doing outstanding work.
But, keep heart, my friend. Our community is growing rapidly and will soon represent a truer cross-section of society. I think now is the time for especially small charities to continue building their support networks and communications. Then to have those in place as our user base grows through its next phase. Or so I believe.

Welcome to the forum, baub.  With just 1 btc of value and you just starting out, I wouldn't jump through all the hoops of a multi-sig paper wallet.  I'd just do an old-fashioned paper wallet, keep a copy yourself in a very safe place and give one to the child's parents with the same instruction.
Then you can add to the wallet on birthdays, etc., if you like.  And if anything happens to you or the parents, the other has a copy of the wallet.  Later on you might want to do something else with this fund; but this makes it simple and safe in the meantime.

It could help, but probably not. Some folks will seek out bitcoin for the security it offers.

In full deflationary mode, bitcoin will be under pressure just as is every other asset class.

I'm with you on more strongly supporting businesses that hold onto their receipts in bitcoin. But I think it's a different scenario with non-profits. We appreciate the business that believes enough to assume the risk of holding bitcoin, like the rest of us do. His profits and losses stand on the wisdom of his business decisions, and his to hold bitcoin is but one of many he makes and depends on.
But a charity is not a for-profit venture.  It's not the head of the charity who stands to gain or lose directly from the money decisions he/she mades -- its the service constituency of the charity. That's why the leader has to make much more conservative assumptions and develop more conservative business practices.
And.. Just like it's reasonable for bitcoin prices to sometimes take a big swoon like they have for the last year, it's also human nature for donor to hold their coin closer to their chest during times of price decline. Prolonged price decline hurts the value of a charity's holdings in bitcoin; it also hurts the willingness of supports to keep giving like they once did. A "bitcoin charity" has to know this and take than into account as they manage their finances.

Just to be clear.. If you're a U.S. taxpayer and itemize on Form 1040, Schedule A, your bitcoin donation to a 501(c)(3) is ALWAYS tax-deductible. Whether you have a gain or a loss in the disposition, the current value of your donation at its time of gifting is fully tax deductible on Sch A. In this regard, it's like donating cash: You donate, you deduct.
And there is usually nothing special about the capital gains (Sch D) tax on U.S. donations to 501(c)(3) organizations. Giving bitcoin directly is treated just like a sale or other disposition -- short-term, long-term, for gain or loss -- *WITH THIS MAJOR EXCEPTION:* Donations of bitcoin that you have held for a long-term gain, are *TAX EMEMPT*; *i.e.,* you make no report of the gain on your Sch D AND you still get the tax deduction on Sch A, as well!  It's the best of all scenarios.
To summarize..
* Bitcoin held short-term for a loss and donated: You take the capital loss (Sch D) and take the tax deduction (Sch A).
* Bitcoin held short-term for a gain and donated: You pay capital gains tax (Sch D) and take the tax deduction (Sch A).
* Bitcoin held long-term for a loss and donated: You take the capital loss (Sch D) and take the tax deduction (Sch A).
* Bitcoin held long-term for a gain and donated: You pay NO capital gains tax (Sch D) and take the tax deduction (Sch A).

Coinbase does have a Personal Payment Page option that you can set up on an account.

Maybe you missed this thread on another forum:    Note the last three posts on security; especially the last one by the developer.
If you can trust the security of the cloud service and the present MB encryption, you can do automatic cloud backups now -- without waiting for the new HD software. The HD version improves on the encryption and brings the automation issue more front and center; but you can still use dropbox, spideroak, mozy or others to handle what you have now.

This is what Coinbase has done already. Whenever one CB customer sends btc to another, they just transfer the coins internally and instantly. The transaction never sees the blockchain. To whatever extent new large outlets opt to use something like Coinbase, and CB continues growing its retail customer base, more and more busyness will be spared the blockchain.

The Linux bitcoin client - bitcoind - is a node, but not automatically a "full node". Unless you open port 8333 on your firewall, bitcoind/Bitcoin-QT/Bitcoin Core.. they all just maintain current copies of the blockchain. When new blocks are added to the blockchain, the client updates so you have the latest iteration of the blockchain. This is sometimes called a *leech node*, because it does nothing to give back to the network; it only updates itself from connections to other nodes.
"Full Node" speaks to making your copy of the blockchain available so that other nodes can contact it and confirm the information they gather from other nodes in the blockchain with that in your copy, too. In this way, it opens the door so that your blockchain copy can be used by others; and thus, for you to give back to the network.
Does that help? There's no special difficulty with Linux. It works the same on any operating system. But yes, there is plenty of confusion and misunderstanding about running a Full Node.. why it's important and how to achieve one.

..that is, 3% on top of whatever brand-specific discount there is on the gift card!  Just start your checkout by clicking the cart icon in the upper right of the screen, and apply the coupon code **Cards4Coins**
There are dozens and dozens of card choices.  (See the full list on the left margin of the page.)  Some of the most popular e-cards and their current discounts are:
* Walmart - 2.6%
* Target - 4%
* Home Depot - 9%
* Lowe's - 7.5%
* Best Buy - 3.6%
* JCPenney - 11.3%
* Macy's - 9.2%
* Kohls - 5.5%
* TJ Maxx - 15.5%
* Victoria's Secret - 7.1%
* Sears - 6.1%
This is new!  CardFlip used to give 2% extra discount for all bitcoin purchases.  Then they did a Bitcoin Friday promotion for 3%.  Now it's 3% all the time!
I used to use Gyft and eGifter for all the card buying I could.  Now the clear best choice is CardFlip.  They're great supporters of the bitcoin ecosystem.

If your sister is a newbie and her average balance is not too large, I would have her stay right there, using their wallet. It's probably the safest, most trusted place to keep your funds in the U.S. -- that, in spite of its often vociferous detractors. As your sister gains experience and comfort in the bitcoin space, she will probably get to feeling comfortable enough to move her coins to blockchain or a software wallet. But venturing there before one knows what he's doing can be a venture fraught with its own large risks.

Storing your bitcoin as bitcoin does help, since it holds those coins out of circulation.  But holding USD in a Circle or Coinbase account does not help at all.  That said, don't buy more bitcoin to hold it, just to help the price.  Bitcoin is still a volatile currency, and there's no reason for you to get pounded in the value of your holdings, just to show your support.
Since bitcoin is a supply-and-demand market, and it's already a marketplace much bigger than your personal fortunes or mine -- it's foolish to think that anything we can do as individuals really help stabilize or support prices.  Don't order your finances on any notions of what you can do to affect the market for bitcoin.  Just buy and hold an amount that's good for you, and use it as much as you can -- especially when it buys you things at a discounted price. Educate others and talk it up to businesses. Then let those grander forces in our universe do what they will with our futures.

Here's Litecoin on reddit:   It's still active, as it always has been. Dogecoin resently merged its mined into the much more vibrant Litecoin powerhouse.  It's price has really stabilized nicely of late:   I bought more down at 0.01 recently, just like I did last year. It still makes a lot of sense to buy btc, convert to ltc when the ratio is low, and spend when the ratio rises.

1 -- You have to find a means to convert (local) fiat-to-bitcoin and/or bitcoin-to-local fiat at both ends of the transaction. That may be an exchange, or LocalCoins, or a friend -- whatever works in that location.
2 -- You buy bitcoins with fiat in the country of origin for your remittance.
3 -- You sent the bitcoin to your destination point.
4 -- You there convert the bitcoin to fiat.
Really, it's a simple process. The hardest may be finding how to convert money in those mid-Eastern countries, though someone here can probably help you with that, too.  If you or the party you're sending to here in the U.S. has a checking account, the easiest here is probably to use Coinbase or Circle, to start with.

Agreed.  Even if you pay 1% to buy your coin on Coinbase, the Gyft solution puts you ahead of the game.

I think you have the right idea. It is only your net capital gain (capital gains minus capital losses) that is taxable, anyway. And -- depending on your buy and sell prices -- your net capital gains are often not nearly as great as your cash-out sum. So it is that you can likely cash out far more than $36k in coin, and still have 0 tax to pay.

I think of bitcoin as the egalitarian equalizer of finance, something that sets its ventures apart from the bankers and Wall Street crowd. Now Coinbase has gone and bought into the trappings of the oligarchs. Not good.

Morblius set a 100-connection throttle on my three nodes, but they sometimes exceed that, anyway. I just checked, and one is running 120! They probably average 60-80, I'd guess. But ANY contribution is better than none.
I would have run a node on my own computer except for **the cost**. By the time you add electricity to hardware to bandwidth demand.. the VPS was my only best alternative. Oh, and I still can't figure out how to open port 8333 on my router. ;)

Yes. But for it to be a good arbitrage play, you have to have your dollars sitting at BTC-E so you can **at the same time** hit the buy there and the sell on Coinbase.  A $10 price spread is only 2.5%, though, and that will be almost all eaten up by your commissions on both sides of the trade.

Last week, I started another thread with this post:
PSA: Add a Full Node for just $19/year!
Last week I added three bitcoin network nodes and the process was EASY! I just opened an account with weloveservers.net (WLS), added each server, and got redditor Morblius to set them up the nodes for me.
For months now, I've wanted to run a full node to support the network; but I don't have a good way to run Bitcoin Core on my home network, and I lack the expertise to set up a VPS node myself. This made it 'oh, so easy!'
Morblius does a minimalistic setup so that the node runs at peak efficiency. He takes donations which he uses to set up more nodes on his own, as well. He's a trusted member of this reddit group and on bitcointalk. I couldn't be happier with his help getting these nodes set up for me.
Here's all there is to do this yourself:
    Go to  At the end of the presentation for “LEB 1GB” (left side of page), click on the “Order” link. That will open a service specification page for your new weloveservers account.
    Provide a Hostname of your choosing, select 'Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 64 Bit' for your Operating System, and select a Location.
    Click the “add to cart &amp; checkout” button, to go to your order summary. Fill out your personal account details and follow the instructions to pay for this first service. Within a few moments, you'll get three or four emails, the last of which (New VPS Server Information) has a section called SSH Access Information, which has all you need to get into your server and set up your node.
When you get your SSH Access Information, send it to Morblius ( in a private message and ask him to set it up for you. Often he can get that done VERY quickly, and he'll send you back the links to monitor your new node. See these for one of my nodes:  
Note: Once you've arranged for your first VPS for $19, you can add as many others as you want. Just open your WLS account page and (in a new tab) go to the lowendbox promotion page mentioned above. Now when you click on the Order link, it will take you directly to adding another service on your same WLS account.
Of course, you can use the loendbox promotion and set up your own nodes; and Morblius may help you set up nodes on another service, too. But this is what worked for me. I thought.. I could commit to $5/month to run a full node for the network. Now I have three for even less. What a deal!

This is such a stupid argument! I can't believe people still keep believing it. So.. I live in upper NY State, where we often have winter ice storms that can take out power for hours or even days. So.. by this reasoning, it's a waste for any more than one person in my town to run a node. You know we're going to have a power outage sooner or later; and, when it comes, all the nodes are going to fail. Now that's stupid.

As I understand it, they get them through direct relationships with the merchant. And they get them at negociated discount prices -- those discounts hefty enough for them to pass on significant point discounts to buyers with crypto.
On their web site, CoinFueled says they cannot offer the gas cards cheaper because it's next to impossible for them to get them discounted from the oil companies. So they have to buy them at face value and make their profit on the postage and handling fees.

1. The node can't send information it doesn't already have. If a node's not synced with the entire chain, it's of no use in verifying transactions.
2. I don't think there's any *optimal amount of nodes* that can be calculated. But there's clearly a lack of sufficient nodes now.

The multiple paper wallets makes it really simple and safe. Once you create the paper wallet, you can put it and even a html file of it in your safe deposit box somewhere, then check on it from your browser if you want. Even add more coins to it at any time. I like putting just 10-20 coins in each paper wallet, so I don't have a terribly large balance in any one of them. Then when I want to put a wallet balance back in my 'spending' circulation, I just empty the balance back there and I'm ready to go.

One-time gift.. what you're prepared to lose and it still be OK, I guess.  When our first grandchild was born, we started setting aside $500/year in U.S. Savings Bonds.  For the first and the others to follow, we've continued doing the same -- each purchase on the child's birthday. This year I started putting the birthday gifts into bitcoin paper wallets, one for each, and hope to go on doing that till they need the money for college.  My guess is that the bitcoin portion of each child's savings will be much larger than the savings bond part.

Yes, multibit.org has been down for a while now. It's discussed at length on their forum: 
I would guess the devs are super-busy working on the new HD version of the program, and attentions to the web site have fallen by the wayside.
I'm a long-time user of Multibit, but I have to say this doesn't inspire much confidence.

I wonder if there wasn't some other problem with your account. Have you tried contacting customer service? I'm in contact with several folks using these for bitcoin nodes, and no one else has reported any such problem.

I see a project here. For all of us in the land of plenty. Maybe someone can do the research to make and maintain a directory of VPS companies in Third World countries, ones that would accept payment in bitcoin and be reasonably priced. Then we could scatter some new nodes in those places, just to help more.

I'd love to help, but I don't have the expertise to set up and maintain an efficient and cost-effective node. I'd be happy to pay my own subscription to the VPS, if you could set it up and maintain it for me. Or, I could send you $10/mo to do it all. I guess my only concern with that would be that I'm getting what I pay/donate for.. that the IP you send is the unique node I'm supporting. Could we make this work?  
I've been wanting to do something like this for a while now. It's too bad someone doesn't set up an .org to do this for folks. It could be a real service to the network. I thought one fellow was setting this up at 'crowdnode.org' but that's apparently going nowhere.

I have sent Litecoin donations before. Now for one with Bitcoin. Done.
@_date: 2014-04-22 14:07:00
Last week I added three bitcoin network nodes and the process was EASY!  I just opened an account with weloveservers.net (WLS), added each server, and got redditor Morblius to set them up the nodes for me.
For months now, I've wanted to run a full node to support the network; but I don't have a good way to run Bitcoin Core on my home network, and I lack the expertise to set up a VPS node myself.  This made it 'oh, so easy!'
Morblius does a minimalistic setup so that the node runs at peak efficiency.  He takes donations which he uses to set up more nodes on his own, as well.  He's a trusted member of this reddit group and on bitcointalk.  I couldn't be happier with his help getting these nodes set up for me.
Here's all there is to do this yourself:
* Go to   At the end of the presentation for “LEB 1GB” (left side of page), click on the “Order” link. That will open a service specification page for your new weloveservers account.
* Provide a Hostname of your choosing, select 'Ubuntu 12.04 LTS, 64 Bit' for your Operating System, and select a Location.
* Click the “add to cart &amp; checkout” button, to go to your order summary.  Fill out your personal account details and follow the instructions to pay for this first service.  Within a few moments, you'll get three or four emails, the last of which (New VPS Server Information) has a section called SSH Access Information, which has all you need to get into your server and set up your node.
When you get your SSH Access Information, send it to Morblius ( in a private message and ask him to set it up for you.  Often he can get that done VERY quickly, and he'll send you back the links to monitor your new node.  See these for one of my nodes:
Note: Once you've arranged for your first VPS for $19, you can add as many others as you want.  Just open your WLS account page and (in a new tab) go to the lowendbox promotion page mentioned above.  Now when you click on the Order link, it will take you directly to adding another service on your same WLS account.
Of course, you can use the loendbox promotion and set up your own nodes; and Morblius may help you set up nodes on another service, too.  But this is what worked for me.  I thought.. I could commit to $5/month to run a full node for the network.  Now I have three for even less.  What a deal!
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:59:25
Tony, can you also have them put your BitPay donation mechanism as a payment option directly on their web site?  That way I can get them on this resource:

I don't know whether there's a company-offered service that would handle this for you.  Have you looked at the Coinbase apps list ( or contacted their customer support about this?  I do know there are companies that handle subscriptions like you mention, but I've guessed that was something they did internally, not through a third-party source. Bitcoin is a PUSH technology, so this is not as easy to do as will a banking/pull product. But there's surely a way to do it effectively.  I have a VPN service with PIA and some full nodes with a VPS (We Love Servers). Both of those bill me (bitcoin) in email each time my subscription renewal is drawing near. I just follow their link and pay.

Not worried.  No company can get business forecasting right all the time. Algorithms can only do so much. Every inventory control manager will tell you that. There are times when you have to override what the computer model is telling you and fly by the seat of your pants. Even then, there are times that leaves face down lying on the ground. For Coinbase this is JUST about inventory control.

Yeah, I guess that's my take-away from my experience: btcd is definitely for developers and sophisticates only. Supposedly it's as far along the development path as is bitcoind.

Pseudo-anonymity. The "pseudo" part is key. Does anyone who uses this word with bitcoin really know what it means? Look it up in any online dictionary. The meaning will probably surprise you.
But it is *right on* in the bitcoin context. Especially when dealing with Coinbase. Coinbase is a U.S. company. You've sent them all matter of personal information to verify your account and set up your links to bank and credit card. And you don't think they share that freely with government jurisdictions (like the IRS, attorneys general, etc.) that ask for it?! Their staying in business depends on their compliance with regulations and furnishing information as required by law.
I'm a customer of Coinbase myself. I don't write this to bad-mouth them. I'm just saying.. you have no more anonymity with using Coinbase than you do using your bank or credit card company.

Our un-free financial markets need regulations because the big players are all crooks, looking to constantly game the system to their own ends.

This is an issue of BOINC in general, not the SETI Project.  All the BOINC projects run over the same core program and settings.  And, yes, as OP wrote, there are numerous settings that can reduce the amount of work your computer does on your chosen projects.  There are settings for % of CPU, max # of cores, time of day, and so forth. You can even set BOINC to suspend work when you open other specific programs. You can find full documentation here: 
And this: BOINC will run just fine on the same computer as a bitcoin full node. Both programs yield computing cycles splendidly to all operator functions, so as not to effect your input performance at all.
While you're on the BOINC site, take a look at the other projects you can choose from. You may find others more interesting to you than SETI.

CB does not use the blockchain for CB &gt; CB payments; for others, yes. I don't use the recharge side with my purchases from Coinbase, but here's what makes it seem plausible for some: If you believe the price of bitcoin will always trend up, and you'd rather not worry about decisions when to buy; or if you want to keep a low, constant value in your account -- then this works for you.  It's not how I would do it, but he is no fool who does it for the right reasons.

bitcoinj -- does that have a daemon (like Bitcoin Core) that volunteers run to support its own blockchain iteration?  Something like btcd?
@_date: 2014-09-19 17:15:32
Just for the record.. WLS has chosen NOT to market seeking bitcoin nodes. They have concerns about the heavy bandwidth use -- especially during the huge blockchain download. So, I wouldn't mention that when you have dealings with their support team. Just pay in bitcoin and be about your business. And maybe start your nodes one by one -- spacing out your phase-in -- so they have less reason to question what you're about.
I did my original $19/yr set up, one node at a time over successive days. Then when I wanted to convert to the $2/mo deal, I wrote one customer support ticket and asked to change all three running nodes.  Since they allocate the additional disk space internally, you don't have to start the blockchain all over again.  Matter of fact, your operating node never even hiccups.

Maybe you could explain how that works [and is not true].. that you profit as a company from cancelling orders in a rising market.

@_date: 2014-05-10 22:40:22
Not to worry, it's a common misunderstanding. The tell-all test of whether your QT or Core client in serving as a Full Node or not is how many connections it establishes with the network after it's downloaded the full blockchain and is fully synced. You can roll over the little icon in the lower right of the program window and it will show you how many active connections you have. If you consistently run at 8 connections or less, you do not have a Full Node. If you run at more than 8 connections, you do.
If you have a Full Node (running at more than 8 connections), there may or may not be some esoteric hoops you can jump through to make it even more effective -- *i.e.*, with more/faster/better connections.  But with 8+ connections, you have a Full Node contributing to the health of the network.
If you don't have a Full Node -- that is, if you run at 8 or fewer connections -- and everything else about your client installation seems to be running as it should, then you should ONLY need to successfully open port 8333 through your firewall.  Once you do that, you might have to restart your bitcoin client, but it should then *automatically* climb past the 8 connections to a variable number several times larger.

A node is a connection point to other nodes in the system. So if you run Bitcoin Core, the node on your computer connects with those of at least 8 other computers similarly connected to the network. If you run a Full Node, then your software connects your node to far more computers.  That's better.

**This is probably NOT the news you think it is!**
eGifter has had Amazon (US) cards for a long time now. But Amazon recently started offering gift cards for their European outlets, and eGifter just picked those up, too. So anyone buying from Amazon in the UK, France or Germany can now buy an eGifter card for those specific outlets. eGifter announced this on Facebook on Nov 4.

HERE'S HOW TO DO IT. Get your gift card with e-Gifter and print it to paper. Take your paper card to the service desk at the Walmart store and have them transfer to card balance from you e-Gifter paper card to one of their own (usually blue) plastic cards. ALL the checkout stations know well how to ring up a sale using a balance on the Walmart brand card, and you can even use it to buy their gas at the pump! I'm going to buy about $1000 worth this weekend, just in case their stay at e-Gifter ends up being a brief has it's been before.

Coinbase doesn't charge or make withdrawals from a credit card. They just use it as a backup/validator for instant purchases with a bank account.  If you order a bitcoin purchase from your bank account and you somehow have insufficient funds or stop the payout from your account, they can bill your credit card instead.  If you dispute that, I'm sure they have ample evidence to fight your dispute, since they can show you ordered the withdrawal before from your bank account. It's not like they didn't have your very explicit instructions to take the money.

On an Ubuntu 12.04 machine, I've installed and run bitcoind only, not the Core wallet. Can I install and use Armory with just the daemon backbone I have, or do I also need to install Bitcoin Core -- the wallet part?
@_date: 2014-12-28 00:17:45
Yes. And it goes much faster because it will download from as many as all of its connections, instead of just one as it does now.
@_date: 2014-12-15 17:40:19
Don't forget: Others have looked at this before and reported.. Coinbase has the better price, but charges 1%; Circle doesn't charge the 1%, but has a worse price.  Bottom line.. Who do you want to do business with?
@_date: 2014-12-12 01:33:00
IRC.. that's way above my pay grade. Never used it in my life. Never needed to. Till this. I dare say if one polled the universe of bitcoin enthusiasts out there -- even the smaller group of all those running full nodes with Core or bitcoind -- one would find the tiniest percentage that would be comfortable having to use IRC for all their communications about the use of some other software. Arguably better than the legacy software; infinitely harder to learn about and feel comfortable with.
I went on someone's recommendation that I try btcd on a Windows machine I have. The setup was easy enough.  But even after running bitcoind on a Linux machine and 3 VPSs, I found things that troubled/puzzled me -- things I wanted to ask about.  And no one around to ask. That seems hardly the way to promote the use of a new product one's offering to the faithful.

Not to put a damper on your enthusiasm for Coinbase (I'm a happy customer, myself) but this in one reason IMHO *not* to use them for long-term storage of your coins (private keys).
I use Coinbase for buying coins, and carry a small balance there for minor purchases. But I do my *vault* storage on paper wallets, and hold and do most of my spending from a software wallet, instead.

You won't find it on their site. Like the American Red Cross, they're not showing it on their site. You have to go the back door route through a BitPay link.

I got back this response: "I can do this for $2/month per server, how does that sound?"
That's more than twice the current cost ($1.58/mo). So I guess we do some more shopping.  :(

OK, I think this is your problem, then.  You have to know the IP address of the computer you're using in your network, in order to open the port to that one computer only.  That is, the open port is specific to that one computer.  It's not available to your whole network.
I have no experience with Mac OS, but I did a little looking around, and it seems you should use this command line prompt: "ifconfig -a"  If it's like it is on Windows and Linux, that should give you a bunch of connection information.  And what you're looking for is something like *inet addr:192.168.1.xxx*  That specific address is the one you want to link to your open port.

I just clarified with WLS. The price is a total of $2/mo not that as an extra amount. So $1.58/mo becomes $2/mo, or $24/year.  That's still much cheaper than their regular prices.  And much better than anything else I've found so far.

We all buy our bitcoins with fiat. When we spend them and they're converted back to fiat, they've made the circle complete -- not adding nor taking anything away from the price on a longer term basis. So that's not what's causing drops like the present. It's not that we're in the midst of some gigantic spending spree with merchants converting back to fiat.
When price declines drive the herd to stampede, they don't head for the merchants to spend what they have; they head to the exchanges/buyers to unload quickly.

Enterprises like blockchain can use various price input mechanisms for the different device/platforms they support. Those may or may not always give identical prices. Especially in *fast* market conditions, they may not.  Wallet content valuations don't really matter anyway.  They're only approximations of value. When you go to buy or sell with your wallet, it's the OP that determines and proposes their exchange rate, anyway.

Not at all. Why clutter the blockchain with private transactions? The blockchain is a public register. If you're a private party that people have trusted to hold their keys, you have no reason to "go public" with that they ask you to do with their coins. Just journal them from one account to another on your internal ledgers. That's faster, cheaper, and not at risk for network issues there might be.
@_date: 2014-05-30 15:10:29
Good answer. And I spend bitcoin every place I can, too. I just don't buy back every time I spend. I buy a couple/few hundred dollars worth at a time, then just spend on that balance until I need to make another buy.

You pay 1% to buy your coins with Coinbase. Coinbase charges you nothing to sent the coins to Hive. You pay a *tiny* transaction fee to spend from Hive. That's not a expensive way to do things.  Coinbase gives you great convenience on buy; Hive gives you security for holding and easy in spending.

Yeah, new threads doesn't really do it well, I don't think.  Of course you could send PMs to persons of interest here, as long as that's not abused, m'thinks.

But really, FB seems enough, for those that really want to keep in touch.

I know things like this can and do happen. But it seems to happen so infrequently now, I wonder if many of the occurrences are from things Coinbase cannot control. When I used to use MultiBit software some, I had transactions hung up there, too. Actually, that's a significant part of why I moved to transacting mostly with Coinbase. Just saying.

@_date: 2014-08-01 20:43:33
I would try sending the full amount in your wallet. It that wallet is with Coinbase, they'll pay the tx fee for you. If not, then the wallet should reject the transaction and flash a message how much the fee would have been to send it. Then you know exactly by how much to reduce your 'send' amount for it to go through.

Oh, yes.  That's the gold standard of torrents, I think.
The only thing I've tweaked from Morbius' script.. I found my nodes were pushing right up and exceeding the max connection limit default (100) that's in bitcoind.  So I had Morb resent it on one to 125.. to see if that would let it connect more without causing problems with the program or the VPS provider.  So far so good.. but then, that node's not yet caught up with my others, to see if it will go on to higher numbers.

One more thing. You might also run the World Community Grid on your computer -- or any other BOINC project. I was running this P2P project long before I started with bitcoin.. to use 100% of my computers' idle cycles for good. Now I run bitcoind on my Linux machine and btcd on my Windows, and I find I can still run WCG on top of those, and it doesn't take away any of their productivity!  BOINC connects to its grid only from time to time and uses very little bandwidth when it does. So my machines are doing a ton of good work.. all the time.

To Kelly's point.. One of bitcoin's earliest and most enthusiastically supported charities has gotten into a heap of fiscal problems this year because of holding bitcoin receipts in bitcoin, till they were needed by the organization.  That's at least foolhardy management. A small amount of bitcoin receipts held for immediate bitcoin purchase of supplies.. that seems good and prudent.  But there's a huge currency risk with holding bitcoin -- especially huge for a charity to assume.

No mail here. And bitcoin are being used. Just not transferred over the blockchain. Just a private transaction between parties and a partner-agent autorized by both parties. Coinbase takes NO fee for this transaction; none from either party. There's no underhanded sleaze involved in any way. I guess that's too complicated for some people to understand.
Originally, all bitcoin transactions were done over the blockchain. And some purists might argue it still has to be as it was then. But it makes about as much sense as the passengers that came over on the Mayflower arguing that everyone who came later was not as American as they were.
Off-chain transactions are now a legitimate part of the bitcoin ecosystem. They not all scams just because someone wants to call them that.
@_date: 2014-12-25 12:42:31
I would NOT recommend btcd. It is a full node, just like bitcoind. The blockchain it has to download is just as large as it is for bitcoind, and it will beat your hard drive to death while it's checking all the transactions.

Giving bitcoin directly to a qualified charity.. in all cases you take the tax deduction for the gift on Schedule A.

It occurs to me that this principle also works in the favor of **spending or donating** bitcoin (for goods or services) and immediately buying back the spend amount.  Clearly, that gives "economic significance" to the disposition.  This is especially good to know for customers of a service like Coinbase, which allows one to immediately repurchase the bitcoin amount of a payment made. 
Of course, there is "economic significance" is every spending or donating of bitcoin -- almost anything except outright selling.  So anyone who *USES* their bitcoin and then replenish their stock on *any* schedule or time frame is clear of this convoluted "economic substance doctrine" issue.

If your friends also have their wallets with Coinbase, those transactions (CB to CB) will be instantaneous.  It's the same if you pay a merchant who clears through Coinbase; again CB to CB; again instant.  All CB-to-CB transactions are cleared internally and never hit the blockchain.  It's the CB to other wallet that go onto the blockchain and take longer.

I am installing btcd on a Widows 7 (64-bit) machine with the .msi istaller.  On the initial sync, I'm up to block 324k -- and the HDD is reading/writing constantly!  The green light on my box hardly even flashes.  It's much more ON than OFF.

You have to know.. A the frequent complaint we read here is for cancellation of a trade for *high risk*.

That is, that you don't want to give the customer the cheap coin; you want to keep it for yourself. Any truth to that?

Test transactions are not real transactions. You've been played for a fool, not transferring your mining rewards to your own wallet from the outset. If you had not been able to do that after two weeks or a month, you would not have gone on all this time expecting them to just be there when you wanted them.

I had one issue while it was doing the original blockchain sync. It was **constantly** reading/writing to the hard disk!  I grew a bit alarmed when the download progressed slowly and the situation never let up.  I posted about it on a message board and was told that's normal during the original sync, but it should go away afterwards.  I waited and it went away when the sync was finished.
Now I'm inquiring about some command like "bitcoind getinfo" that will show me at least the connection status of the program when it's running.  From the lines in the command window, it seems like it's maybe connected to only a handful of external nodes for outbound and inbound.  Far fewer that what I get with bitcoind.

Can you help me with this? A few days ago, I set up bitcoind on an Ubuntu machine, and opened port 8333 in my router. All fully synced and running, it surprises me that it's still making only 12-15 connections.  That is, checking in terminal.. *bitcoind getinfo*.
That seems like very few connections; on my VPS nodes I average more than 50!
If i run *ifconfig* in terminal it shows: inet address: xxx.xxx.x.110 and Bcast: xxx.xxx.x.255  Checking those two on  -- both addresses return the message that the node is unreachable.
Can you tell me if I have a problem here?  Thanks.

I'm a holder and a spender. Actually, I hold off on bitcoin purchases when the price is low. *Especially* when it's lower than what it was when I bought the coin I'm spending.  It makes no sense to spend coins at a capital loss, just to "support the currency."

Oh, no problem.   This still has promise, I guess, if I can find a way to check on the connections, and find they're more robust than it appears. Finding a place to get answers is a definite problem.  Hopefully it will get better.
I think there might be a bootstrap, but using that's beyond my competency level so I really didn't pay attention.
RAM shows just 250k now.  I can still run BOINC on my machine, too.  But I definitely see some programs loading and running slower with this full house.  Apparently btcd keeps BOINC from releasing idle cycles as quickly as it does normally.
I'd really like to see this work.  There's a lot to recommend it.  I'll give it some more time before moving on to try something else.  In my experience, it is not ready yet for prime time.

I don't know of any cons. Here are my pros:
* I never mastered how to open the necessary port on my firewall/router, so that Bitcoin Core could act as full node.
* I found where to get a VPS node for just $19/year, and figured that was less expense than the electricity, IPS bandwidth charge and equipment wear of doing it on my own. Plus it gives me a more direct connection to the Internet, to better service the network.
* I found a willing and most capable volunteer here to do all the setup and maintenance for me.

Kudos on the initiative; but this seems to be presently a far less optimal solution than the VPS. It does get the node stress off one's computer, but it's still on the rest of the I/O system. The high cost is still there (hardware, electicity, bandwidth service) and it's just another device to have to setup and maintain on one's network.

Buy GAS and merchandise with a **Walmart** gift card from CardFlip.  Or buy discounted cards from **dozens of other stores**, restaurants, and services – some with discounts of more than 10%!
CardFlip inventories all cards in their physical/plastic iteration. But if you prefer the e-card format, just specify that in the order instructions and they'll send the ones you want in PDF files.  If you order the physical cards, those will be mailed to you at no charge, via USPS with tracking.
Each brand has a specific discount for all its cards.  But on all orders you can get an extra 2% off by checking out through the shopping cart icon (at the upper right of the screen) and applying the discount code of “bitcoin777”. 
I've made several purchases from CardFlip now.  It's a great service, with access to some additional stores and greater discounts than Gyft and eGifter.

For Walmart cards with Cardflip.. if you want an e-card (instead of the physical card), you just have to specify that in the comments/special instructions box on the checkout form. It works for me every time.  AND, don't forget to specify "Cards4Coins" as a coupon code and pay with bitcoin for an extra 3% off the discounted 2.6% with Walmart.  They'll get you that ecard in a pdf file, usually within a few hours.  They're a small hands-on shop, not all automated like Gyft and eGifter.  But be patient and work with them.  They'll treat you right.

@_date: 2014-12-01 12:16:25
IMPORTANT: If you're *under water* on bitcoin you go to sell or spend -- *i.e.*, if the price is lower now than when you bought them -- you actually have a **Tax Loss** on your taxes, which you can use to offset other taxable income.  There are 'capital gains' and 'capital losses'; the first costs you tax dollars, the second reduces your tax burden.
No one likes to take a loss on a transaction.  It still hurts our pride to do so.  But it's not like that sale at a loss is going to cost you taxes on top of that.  Actually, the tax write-off rather dulls the pain of the loss.

Oh, but paying with bitcoin doesn't cost me less. The merchant's already past his credit expense on to ALL customers. So I pay those anyway, plus my 1%. I don't vote in protest to the credit system by spending my bitcoin. In fact, I support it anyway, unless the merchant gives a discount to the crypto users.
But I digress. My fundamental point was, why do the instant buy back with Coinbase. Spend just as much, but buy bitcoin in larger quantities and spend down your account till time to buy more.

Early this year, I wrote to all the charities we normally give to each year, making the case for them to set up for donations in bitcoin. It is really easy to do especially since Bitpay offers free accounts to charities! In a bit of conscience, a bit of arm twisting, I encouraged each to write or call me if they had more questions about why or how to do it, and I mentioned it was my intention to this year give only to organizations receiving bitcoin.
I had only one charity get on board.. so I've been sending them their daily Bitpay maximum (still at $100) every day I can.  Here's their donation page, if anyone else wants to check them out.  They're a great children's ministry in Juarez, Mexico. One we worked with directly some 45 years ago. And still doing great things in their neighborhood.

You could help them set up a Coinbase or Circle account in their names and linked to their bank account.  You set it up for them, but you control the access with their permission.
Then you send your bitcoin to their wallet, and then authorize selling the coin there to transfer the fiat to their account. That's not fully automatic, but as close as you can get, I think.

Circle is much different than Coinbase or BitPay. And bitcoin as we know it now is just a small piece of their plan. They're all about building a full suite of financial services built on the blockchain.
Bitcoin buying/selling and wallets is pretty much where the game is now, so that's where they started.  And they're still trying to get the bugs worked out of their start game. But going forward, they'll become less involved with bitcoin as we know it; more involved with everything else we call 'financial services', albeit built on the blockchain technology instead of the legacy banking platform.
@_date: 2014-05-12 11:17:06
Bitcoin is built on consensus. Lots of people/computers/nodes agreeing on past transactions as the basis for verifying present and future transactions. Nodes are one's connection to the bitcoin universe. If you have just 8 connections, your transactions can verify; if you have a full node, your copy of the blockchain help verify transactions for other people.
@_date: 2014-09-01 23:41:09
Did you miss my point? "CB does not use the blockchain for CB &gt; CB payments; for others, yes." I'm not saying they don't use the blockchain; just not for payments from one customer to another.  Just like a bank would not involve the Federal Reserve in a transfer I order from my account to my wife's account at the same bank. Don't be a hater for imaginary reasons.

I guess I don't see how B2B is anything big that's not already out there in the bitcoin world. Rather behind the scenes, out of the public eye, businesses are already beginning to pay businesses in bitcoin, especially on the international front. The infrastructure is already there for that, and even large hard-to-steer enterprises will turn to it more and more as they see the cost advantages of the same.  Merchant adoption is already there, too -- and Circle brings nothing any better to these tables than what Coinbase and BitPay have there already.   These are part of the bitcoin paradigm that's already working pretty good. These wheels don't need to be reinvented by Circle.

Why would you want this feature? If you spend and immediately buy back with Coinbase, the purchase costs you 1% +$0.15. Thus you're always going to get back fewer bitcoins than you spent, or it's going to cost you more dollars than you spent. Why not just buy with cash, check or credit card? Those don't cost you (the buyer) anything to use.

If you're *holding* a large amount, why aren't you putting most of those in off-line storage -- something like paper wallets? You shouldn't have anything but your 'spending' balance in an online or software wallet, anyway. With paper wallets, you can bookmark the blockchain.info page for each, put all those bookmarks in a browser folder, and quickly check all at one time.

'Property' is not the same as 'merchandise'.  Sales tax is levied when one purchase merchandise, not property. 
If you use your bitcoin to purchase merchandise, you pay state sales tax [or not] just as if you spent your dollars on the same purchase.  But it's the purchasing that triggers the tax, not the use of bitcoin.

Thanks so much! That sounds reasonable enough.  I'll try it.  It would be nice if Core offered better documentation anywhere to be found.  I should think others would benefit from this, as well.  It seems to me.. with the decline of folks running a full node, some of that may be because so many have taken to running other wallets instead of Bitcoin Core (like I have), and don't know they can still do something like this to help the network at the same time.

Sounds like your PC wallet is the only one you have control over.  Coinbase controls all the addresses in their wallet. When you send bitcoins, it's the recipient that specifies the address to use for the transaction.  So your only concern is for your PC wallet receiving address.. that you give to folks send bitcoin to you.  And yes, you should provide a new address each time for those transactions.
@_date: 2014-11-11 02:07:11
Without credit card, about four days usually. With credit card, instantly. But the purchase doesn't come from the credit card; it still comes from your bank account like the slower purchase. They just use your credit card and backup/collateral for the purchase. And if you try something fancy with the process, your account is cooked.

I think Coinbase does excellently, except that they could also offer non-profits a free account like BitPay does. Coinbase's big plus is that they provide a wallet, too; that really makes things smoother for the merchant who wants to have more control on when and how much of their bitcoin receipts the convert to fiat. Not to mention the facility to go out and buy bitcoins to add to their receipts when they need or want to.

Suggestion: I think the organization will get some larger donations if you set them up to receive non-anonymous donations, as well. The anonymous route is sufficient for *old school* bitcoin types, not looking to be receipted for the tax deduction of their donations.
But - in these days of our growing bitcoin ecosystem - there are a lot of potential bitcoin donors that will want a tax deduction for their often larger donations.  And the mechanism on the site now doesn't allow for that. It would be a shame to squander their 501(c)(3) advantage for all donors in bitcoin.
May I suggest.. keep it as you have it now for those wanting to just drop some coins anonymously.  But add a third party processor like BitPay for documenting contributions with donors who want to be receipted for income tax deduction.
elizabeth will do you a great job on setting up an account.  BitPay might even have an api that will allow for both anonymous and non-anonymous gifting.

Yes, they will take your coins, as I pointed out earlier. But they're not really very hospitable about it.
In previous correspondence I've had with them, I was told they wouldn't be making the bitcoin option any easier to find on their site because they knew there were some complicated tax consequences to donating/spending bitcoin, and they didn't want donors to get in trouble for not properly accounting for the tax implications of their donation. 
Can you believe that?!  I was so angry and insulted when I read that! Here we have a charity not very happy about taking our money.. because we might all be too stupid to stay out of trouble if we give it!

Yeah, giving is probably the coolest part of bitcoin. There's one charity that I've known and given to for over 50 years. When I told them about bitcoin and my desire to make all my donations in bitcoin this year, they promptly opened a free account with BitPay and I've been giving to them ever since.

Yes. Of course, this fits as a "Best Practice" for several reasons; but there are reasons some folks do otherwise, as you already see from this topic thread. * Your PC and phone wallets should generate new addresses pretty automatically; that should not be an onerous hassle. * But you do what you want to do. That's the beauty of bitcoin.  The safest procedure often takes a bit more work, so you have to decide yourself whether it's worth it for you.

The first order in the Name Your Own Discount program (not "Instant") is limited to 8%.  You can't get the discount slider to go any greater than that.  It's after that first completed order that you can go much higher, if you wish.
This is a good thing.  Just make a small order first to get familiar with the process.  Of course that first order with come as fast as the *Instant* option, anyway.  Then you can make a second and subsequent orders at any allowed higher rate that you want.
Frankly, I don't know why anyone would buy for 5% off on their *Instant* program.  You can order for an 8% discount on the NYOD program and get things just as fast.  Then you have the way cleared to set higher discounts on future orders that aren't so urgent for you.

That actually gets you the Amazon merchandise for 3% cheaper! That's the discount the two card companies give you for buying the Amazon card with bitcoin.

You should change your purchase strategy. What are you going to do if the price never gets back down to $500?! You'll be sitting up at night with your guitar, writing songs of woe that you let it get away from you. I'd suggest some dollar-cost-averaging discipline over the next month or two.

I don't think so. Not that I've ever read. But I have read articles from Coindesk and other sources about the high volume of "private transactions" that take place off the blockchain. Things like Coinbase matching its buy and sell orders "in house" with internal transactions, and whale transactions that go through brokers.  Essentially, these are all private transactions between private parties. Except for voluntary disclosure, there's no reason for the parties to disclose or publish these to the outside world.

COST EFFICIENCY
 
You know, especially the promotional price on this VPS makes it a far more cost effective alternative than running Bitcoin Core (bitcoind) on my own computer! I figured.. on my own computer..
* I have hardware cost, maintenance and upgrades -- and a full node takes its toll on the hard drive especially, with its heavy read/write for storage;
* I have electricity costs that are not insignificant -- from running the unit 24/7 at high usage of system resources; and,
* I have to pay extra for my home Internet connection, due to the high bandwidth requirement of the full node.
In my case, that would make the cost of running a full node on a computer at home SEVERAL times that of the single flat charge of the VPS.  It's their equipment, their electricity, and their bandwidth.
As I see it, the only thing really lost by us setting up a bunch of nodes on VPS services all over the world is the widest possible decentralization of this system.  More locations does give greater decentralization.  But I ask, at what cost to total network contribution.  And why not have it both ways?  Some folks will want to set up their own node(s) on home or office equipment; others will want to go with VPS services.  It's all good.

You should make a trial run through the whole order process, on a small personal order.

I'm sorry for the misunderstanding. I think the Outpost is a very deserving enterprise. I've been a supporter ever since I first read about it here on r/bitcoin. My reference to "deserving" was about this post of very old news -- that links to an article more than a month old -- and how the post was immediately promoted to near the top of the HOT page (for everyone to see), even when it had net zero upvotes. I guess I'm puzzled about how some posts seem to have an arbitrary preferred treatment and other more deserving ones -- more beneficial to readers -- languish below, where they only seldom get a passing reader.

Like we used to say on the playground, "What's it to you, Jack?!"  Really!
What's with the constant nay-saying to everything positive that anyone writes about Purse?!
Companies like Amazon enforce their own ToS, and Amazon *for whatever reason* either thinks Purse does not violate it or chooses not to enforce it with them. Why can't that be enough for you?!  What makes you now the judge and enforcer of Amzaon's ToS?  And why does Purse need to respond to you at all?

Good to see you here, Purse! I have a question about buying btc on your site. If I filter all orders to look at just those in the U.S., I see -- especially near the top of the list -- A LOT of VERY LARGE orders from the same spenders. Orders for round dollar amounts, sometimes round to $100-amounts.
Q: What's going on here? These are obviously not orders from individuals for Amazon merchandise -- which I understand is the intended use of your service.
I'm not trolling for another attack vector, as the naysayers here might. I'm a significant personal user and advocate of your service, genuinely asking a question that puzzles me.

Agreed. I run (and prefer) bitcoind on Linux, too. But this is the only way I found to run the daemon only on Windows. I wish bitcoin.org would present this information. My guess is there's a lot of people that download Core and run daemon and wallet full time, while never using the wallet. A pretty bit waste of system resources for some.

Speaking of micro-payments.. Are you set up (with BitPay, or other) that you can assign a fixed address to a donor, for them to use for recurring payments with (at least) Coinbase?  I know they have a customer option where a person can set $X per recurring interval to be paid automatically from their Coinbase wallet to a specific email address or bitcoin address.
I'm just thinking.. That could work great for you, to encourage donors to use a feature like this to commit to perhaps smaller but more regular contributions to your charity.
@_date: 2014-05-16 00:38:48


Key is: Don't look at it as asking for a handout; rather, as presenting folks another opportunity to do something great with their bitcoin. I think serious bitcoiners are generally thankful to be a part of this exciting new medium. We want to see it flourish; we want to help it do that. We want to find services to spend it with; we want to encourage those who provide those services that folks can approach with bitcoin in hand.
So your job is simply to raise your hand (to get folks' attention) and say, "Here we are. Take a look at us." Just show those bitcoiners this one more, and very good thing they can do with what they love. Like the preacher said, "I see that hand!" Those who are meant to help, will help. And spread the word to others.
@_date: 2014-11-26 21:36:47

@_date: 2015-05-16 15:32:18
Man, where do you come up with this stuff? Is this something you do? Is that why you know so much about it?
1)The buyer never gets his bitcoin until the seller confirms receipt of the ordered merchandise. That is *at least* 2-3 days after the buyer picked up the order and paid Amazon. Even if the buyer bought the gift card with a stolen credit card and received the gift card, he has to wait to receive his bitcoin -- a wait longer than what it takes Amazon to verify valid payment for the gift card. And if there is any problem with the transaction, Amazon cancels the shipment immediately and orders UPS to send the undelivered merchandise back to their warehouse. This happened on one of my first Purse orders to spend bitcoin.
2)Since its beginning, Purse has put into place numerous safeguards to keep this kind of thing from happening. Even a Customer Protection Guarantee to reimburse any user that has a problem like this. 
3)Just think a minute. If Amazon ever/often ends up "holding the purse" for these fraudulent orders, why/how is it they continue to welcome/facilitate their relationship with Purse?

Is there a sub-reddit or some other place to find out more about btcd?
@_date: 2014-11-26 23:21:18
  This is the official MultiBit forum. If you post there, you'll likely get a lot more helpful eyes on your case.  If the wallet just disappeared, you were likely hacked. I would solve this issue FIRST, before I downloaded and set up a new client. If your wallet was hacked and you didn't back it up to restore it, then you're probably out of luck. Your education cost you $2.
@_date: 2014-12-14 02:01:00
Looking to start one for fun and education? I would just start by running a node on your PC. That would let you start learning and contributing with no cost outlay to start. Then with time and success, you can look to do more, if you wish.
Probably the best way to run it on a PC is under the Linux command bitcoind. If you're not already running a distro like Ubuntu or Linux Mint, you can install one of those in a dual boot configuration on a Windows machine.  Thus, you have to buy nothing, and you can go back to running Windows anytime you want.
My desktop of choice is Ubuntu 12.04 LTS. I just opened port 8333, set up the bitcoin repository, downloaded the program and let it fly. Of course, you can also download the torrent file to speed up that original download of the blockchain.
I had a fellow here set up 3 VPS nodes with WeLoveServers. Those run perfectly, too, and cost me just $2/month.  You have many choices.

*I think* all the US based companies have their web sites only in English. But if a Spanish speaking person knows enough to get by with English and has an American back account, Coinbase is the clear easiest way IMHO.
I think you could probably find a Spanish speaking service in your area with LocalBitcoins. That would be good, too.
Of course, in the person's country of origin, that's another matter. Exchanges and payment mechanisms of various and sundry sorts are popping up all over Latin America. A specific search here on this sub might yield better information than a general Internet search.  Maybe you can really help members of your community to connect in a good way.
@_date: 2015-05-05 17:10:12
Oh, yes. That makes a big difference. You may never get more than what you already reported. The node software has a way of scoring the performance of your connection (bitcoin-cli getnetworkinfo); and other nodes looking for one to connect with, see your score first and decide whether to connect or look further. You probably have a lot of nodes knocking at the door, but going elsewhere when they see your performance stat.  In terms of helping the network, it looks like you pretty much wasted your money on the ~~birdseed~~ Bitseed.  Your VPS is pretty expensive -- I get mine for 1/10 your cost.  But if yours is like mine, it probably averages about 100 connections at a time.
@_date: 2014-10-22 17:50:55
No need to spend all that money. A sheet or two of paper works just fine.
@_date: 2015-05-20 11:02:46


Have you ever looked at the margins on LocalBitcoins? People buy with those premiums all the time. Then, there are less obvious reasons like these:
@_date: 2014-10-04 20:22:20
What happened to $411 and $340?  Those were tauted with the same conviction you now speak of a yet lower number.
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:03:57
BTW. I think your work will never get much traction, unless you get rid of that requirement to give an email address for your newsletter, before one can even get in to explore the site. Seems too much like a phishing operation, of no real value.

I have read before that paper wallets should be completely emptied with a single transaction. Unless something has changed, that would mean emptying your paper wallet completely to another software or online wallet (like blockchain.info); then send whatever amount you don't want to retain there for spending.. sent that back to a new off-line paper wallet.

It is not Coinbase that requires your information. It is Wikipedia. (See their logo at the top of the form?)  Just like Coinbase has to abide by the KYC rules, Wiki appears to have similar requirements for them recording where donations come from. That, or they just want to know, for their own follow-up purposes.  There are other places you can donate through a Coinbase account, and there is no or much less of a disclosure request.

Yesterday I sent some coin from my Coinbase account to an exchange. When it didn't hit the blockchain within a minute or so, I used the online chat function of CB, and had the agent take a look at it. Then it went through immediately. I'm guessing the support fellow bumped it somehow [or added more tx fee] and it did fine. Maybe this helps.
@_date: 2015-05-05 14:08:30
I think Erik might be adding the QR and/or address to give directly -- as soon as he has a break from the more urgent relief work.  In the meantime, you don't have to fill out all the information on the bitcoin donation page now.  Just the email address at the very top. And you can even give a bogus address there, if you want to.  Just that and the donation amount are enough to take you on to the BitPay form page.

We are all best served if it doesn't have as tumultuous a year as 2013. The price action of the past few days has be very refreshing.

@_date: 2015-05-16 14:47:52
You know not of what you speak. To begin with, sellers don't use gift cards with Purse. It's a buyer who *might* pay with a gift card. Even so, few buyers use gift cards they buy for themselves. After all, they are called gift cards for a reason. And how is a buyer to provide a cash receipt for a card that was given him/her? Again, no sense.

Let the flag be raised, then. But you make yourself to be the smallest voice in the room by continuing to wave the red flag in this forum. Why don't you report *the violation* to Amazon, the Chamber of Commerce, or the business-police of some other domain?  Continuing to shout out your opinions here makes yours a hollow and contemptuous reclamation at best.

Yipes! You should make an instruction note on your site, if there's a special process that some find, some do not. After loading up my wallet,  entering all my info twice and getting to the payment page and seeing nothing but PayPal, I'm out of here empty handed. I'll not do this all again.. to see if perchance I can figure out how to do it right. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 18:33:13
So.. how many times do you need to speak to Amazon.. and they still not do anything.. before you accept the fact that they've now made an informed choice to leave all as it is?  If they know your complaint and choose to ignore it, why can't you give it up and leave it there?  This is not Purse's question to answer; it's Amazon's.  And it seems they've already answered you well enough.
@_date: 2015-05-18 17:34:01


WRONG INFORMATION.
"Once shippend, it cannot be stopped." Oh, yes it can.  Amazon can halt shipment of an order at any point prior to delivery of the purchased goods. They simply notify UPS to cancel the shipment and return the merchandise to the Amazon warehouse.  I know. It happened to me on an early order, when there was a problem with the buyer's payment.
".. until they confirm shipment of items" Should be, till the buyer confirms receipt of the order.
The article is mostly one man's experience -- anecdotal.  Some definite *soft spots* telling the story right and well.  But I'd agree with most of what's written.

Wow! Kind of underscores one more time how all of BitPay's fanfare about now being able to donate bitcoin to the Red Cross has been BitPay blowing its own horn -- and not doing any service for the bitcoin community *nor* the Red Cross. Sad, indeed.
Whenever I approached non-profits about accepting bitcoin, I used to always refer them to BitPay. Any more, I don't feel very good about doing that.
@_date: 2015-05-28 19:01:12
You bet! Purse is really a remarkable service! I've been ordering with 30-35% discount and getting my orders in about a week. Yesterday I entered one at the maximum 50% -- one that I really have no rush for. I'm eager to see how fast it comes back. It seems like large discount orders may go faster when they're for smaller amounts -- like $50 or so.  I don't know why anyone would do the Purse Instant for only 5% off, when you can easily turn around orders for twice that or more, all in the same amount of time.

This is true, and very good for all of us who held *physical gold* with GoldMoney, long before we could hold *digital gold* with bitcoin. GoldMoney's announcement speaks of great innovations coming for their customers, what with the interface with bitcoin.
I can't find the GoldMoney announcement on their web site -- I got mine in email -- but here's their web site: goldmoney.com  I recommend them for anyone wanting to diversify now and hold a little physical gold for diversification.
Edit: Here's the body of the customer announcement email I got yesterday from GoldMoney:






Over the next few months, you will begin to experience a wide range of features and service improvements including:
    Reduced fees on dealing;
    A plastic debit card allowing to spend your gold balance at any traditional point of sale, where credit/debit cards are accepted or to withdraw local currency from any traditional ATM;
    The world's first 24 KT gold plated debit card for customers with over $100,000 in their Holding;
    A mobile application for iPhone, Android and Blackberry, allowing full dealing and payments capabilities (Apple Pay integrated);
    An enhanced customer experience with updated payment methods (fund your account with credit card, ACH or SEPA);
    Free global payments (for non-US resident customers);
    Physical redemption in as little as 10 gram increments (GoldMoney Cubes);
    Multilingual website in 12 languages

If you need anything from Amazon, you can always buy it with litecoin on Purse.IO and get rid of your inventory that way.
With Shapeshift.. just do multiple small batches.  That's a better way to do it anyway, so that your one big transaction isn't hit with a bad exchange rate.

The Coinfueled guy says the problem is that noone can get oil companies to discount their cards, enough for someone like Gyft or eGifter to pick them up; so he has to make his money *on top off* the face value of the cards. Knowing Big Oil as I do, I'd say that is probably true.

"Has this been discussed before? What are your thoughts?"
You've been on this forum for more than a month, and commented on dozens of topics already. Did you and your room mate just get bored and decide to throw this one up to add some noise?

Agreed. The community is very polarized about Coinbase. Most here are OK with them, or vocally very not.  But don't let that scare you off re: Coinbase or Circle. They're still a cheap and efficient way to buy coins.

The *loser* here is the buyer of bitcoin, who -- for whatever reason and of his/her own free will -- decides to get the bitcoin he/she wants at what can be a very steep price premium. There is no deception or fraud here. Everyone enters the arena with their eyes wide open. It may be 'too bad' that some folks have to pay so much to get their bitcoin; but there's no burden of culpability to the seller who simply provides liquidity to the marketplace.
@_date: 2015-05-25 18:58:05


Circle is not a service available to this world's "unbanked" population. Maybe Jenny is one of those.


More than you might think, especially for the "unbanked" that have to spend cash for everything -- that is, before bitcoin came along.


It's not a matter of how much someone makes. It's a matter of net income after paying the expense/exchange rate of actually getting that wage where one can spend it.
There's a whole universe of people whose financial world is ordered much differently than ours is -- worlds we have trouble comprehending, not having walked a mile in their shoes. To say we don't understand why they do what they do is not the same as saying, "They're foolish. Why don't they do as I would do?"
@_date: 2015-05-06 20:41:12
Sorry.. but I'm afraid this is really a publicity shell game at best. These new sign-ups that BitPay writes about do not accept bitcoin on their own web sites, where supporters can find the option time and time again to keep on donating. BitPay throws up a donation page with their own (BitPay.com) address, and expects bitcoin donors to find it there and donate. "Look what we've done!" is the BitPay mantra here.  It's been months now since I've seen a single new non-profit with a bitcoin option on their own web site -- and I scour the news sources every day.
@_date: 2015-05-20 18:53:26
What do you mean, "nonprofit"? There is NOTHING on the web site that verifies that. Just them calling it that. Even their link to the supposed "Arts and Education Foundation" gives no authenticating information.
This is a very poorly executed sham, at best.  Only a fool is parted with his/her bitcoin on this one.

I would definitely keep the name/address page for the reasons you mention.  You might just add a note somewhere that folks who want to give anonymously can just enter the donation amount and click through to the following payment page.
I think I'd check with your accountant or lawyer to make sure you don't violate any IRS rules for nonprofits by accepting anonymous contributions. I don't know if they've tightened up the rules with all the clamp down on anonymity these days.  I know some large organizations (Wikimedia comes to mind) *require* donors to give personal information before they're passed to the donation page.

Isn't that amazing! It's like Amazon doesn't even care. Maybe no one else needs to, either, right?
@_date: 2015-05-30 11:22:40
So.. you're saying that credit and gift cards are inherently fraudulent?  That any business that accepts payment with them clearly invites payment abuse and should be boycotted and lampooned? It's a fact that Amazon lets people pay at all with credit and gift cards that makes Purse a partner in their misconduct? So, to escape this judgement, all Internet merchants need to only accept cash, checks, money orders or bank wires for payment of orders?  
@_date: 2015-05-11 19:14:51

It's really simple. It contributes in the only way any other node contributes to the network -- by giving other nodes one more they can possibly connect with. Whether one owns the server the node's on -- *i.e.*, on your own computer, in your home or office -- or one rents the server -- *i.e.*, VPS -- the node contributes in exactly the same way.
I have a VPS the runs more than 100 connections all the time, while my home network will only support about 40. So, you think I'm wasting my money on the VPS node, just because I don't own the hardware it's sitting on?

One who doesn't check his CC account statements (for unauthorized transactions of *any* kind) is a fool, anyway. No one's to blame but self.


Have you ever looked at the huge premium people have paid at LocalBitcoins for years now? They are little different than found in the Purse marketplace. That's what both services are, a marketplace. Purse just added the Amazon twist to what LBTC has been doing much longer. Both service can find buyers willing to pay such steep premiums for their bitcoin for a whole host of reasons; not just cc fraud. That's really a narrow-minded assumption.
25% vs. 2% with Circle? Some folks don't want the privacy intrusion of the KYC requirements of companies like Circle and Coinbase. Some folks are unbanked and have no access to those services. Some folks may want to buy with stolen CASH. Some folks get paid by Mechanical Turk with Amazon gift cards, and exchanging that payment for bitcoin (even at such a high premium) is still better than buying merchandise from Amazon and paying shipping (sometimes half way around the world) and reselling the merchandise then, because they can't really buy from Amazon what they need for themselves.  It's an incredibly complex world we live in. Not everyone's life fits in such neat little boxes like ours might.  
Obviously there is some cc fraud with payments to Amazon. I'm sure that's a problem they deal with system-wide, and not just Purse orders.  But to assume that Purse orders are fuelled by fraudulent use in some great percentage is really absurd.
@_date: 2015-05-30 15:18:54

It's your perspective that's wrong, not Coinbase, my friend. If you weren't prepared for a little market volatility when you purchased the coin, what in the world were you thinking?  Adjust your thinking, leave bitcoin to folks who can deal with this, or get used to a very long road ahead.

1) It took forever to download the blockchain. Much longer than it did to do the same with bitcoind on a much slower machine. 2) It seemed to thrash and beat my hard drive to death. Especially while downloading the blockchain. 3) It wouldn't connect to incoming connections to serve as a full contributing node. It was no sufficient to just open Port 8333. Devs said there was some litany of other tweaks I need to do myself, because the software would not yet do that automatically.

Well said.
Surely you've read about bitcoin the technology and bitcoin the currency. Long term success of the former is much more certain than of the latter.
I've owned and used bitcoin for some time now. But I'd advise any newcomer.. buy a modest amount now and begin using it. Scale in your holdings over time, but jump in to use it for everything you can right now. You still have a lot to learn. A lot that will only come to you with time and experience.

No, because the coins used in the present, simultaneous buy/spend were never yours to control. You never took *constructive receipt* of them. Essentially, Coinbase used your available funds to buy them and spend them for you. They were never part of an inventory that you controlled for spending.

I know the number can fluctuate quite a bit.  Right now I have 55 connections on my home computer, and 50, 110 and 75 on my three VPS instances.  But only 13?!  And presumably that's in San Francisco, where there should be a ton of other nodes online all the time!
If this tells the whole story, it would seem to paint a less than reliable -- or certainly, not optimal -- situation for perhaps the largest payment/wallet platform in the world.  No wonder some folks complain about Coinbase transactions being slow!

If you wanted to pay with bitcoin, you could add them to an Amazon Wish List and buy them through Purse.IO for a discount of 5-50%. The lower discount range will usually get you delivery as quickly as on Prime orders.

Now with their USD Wallet (offered in a growing list of approved states), one can hold dollars in their Coinbase account (via an FDIC-insured bank) and spend bitcoins from their account with instant buys from the USD Wallet.
In full compliance with IRS rules, those transactions need not be reported at all on one's income tax!  Since the bitcoin buy and sale (disposition) are done simultaneously at exactly the same price -- and the taxpayer has no *constructive receipt* of the bitcoin -- it's not a capital transaction needing to be reported.
One can simply keep enough money in their USD Wallet to do all their bitcoin purchases and donations, and make all of those from that USD Wallet (instead of their normal bitcoin wallet) , and not report any of those on their taxes.  Purchases and donations made with bitcoin from the regular Coinbase bitcoin wallet -- with coin held from prior purchase/receipt -- still must be reported as discussed at length since the IRS ruling came down last year.
PLUS THIS: This spending mode removes ALL the price volatility risk out of one's bitcoin spending!

A principal new feature of the new version is this.  During blockchain download, the current version will *connect* with 8 or more nodes, but it only *downloads* from one at a time; and, if that happens to be a slow connection, it can take a long time. The new version with download from several connections simultaneously, thus expediting the process a great deal.
The torrent file has the complete blockchain up till about March of last year, I think.  So even with using it for all the earlier block, the plodding one-by-one download of all the rest of the blocks can still take a long time.

Bitstamp is not the only game in town! Coinbase probably buys some coins through them, but they *certainly* buy coins from a lot of other places, too.

"Ive seen sites set up but seem complicated and take percentage of it." Are you talking about sites using BitPay or Coinbase? These companies do not take a percentage of payments on their network. Not for donations to charities. You can use them, or just put up a bitcoin address to your organization's wallet. Generally, it will depend on how much information you want to get from those that send you money. A bitcoin address by itself doesn't give you any other information.

If your Linux is Debian or Ubuntu, use the official instructions here: 
You set up the PPA. Then download and install the component(s) you want. And your system update takes care of updating your software automatically from there on.
ON GREAT ADVANTAGE of do it this way is that you can choose to run the bitcoind component of Core *without the wallet component!* And it works splendidly running all by itself.  The Bitcoin Core wallet is not your best wallet choice, anyway.  So you can run bitcoind for your contributing full node, and whatever other better wallet you choose for that function.

Sure. The info is on their web site. They do buy the physical cards, and can mail those to you or send you an e-card iteration if you wish.  They guarantee all cards for 30 days, iron clad.
With Walmart (as with most other companies), you can verify a card balance and store activity on a card as soon as you get it. That's on the Walmart web site.
And just be sure, here's what I do: When I started with CardFlip, I got a generic blank Walmart gift card from their customer service desk, and had them transfer onto it the value of the e-card I got from CardFlip.  That way, if someone tries to use the purchased CF card, it's now blank.. all the value is on the card I hold in my pocket.  Then I use my card and recharge it from time to time with additional cards from CardFlip.

I think you might spend your time and energies more productively by # Assisting charities in setting up to receive bitcoin donations directly, or # Working with some other organization that's already doing what you want to do.

What you've described is a *prompt buy-back* regimen, not the 'auto-buy' you've been hoping for. True.  And your 'prompt buy-back' would still require reporting on your taxes.  If you're quick enough on the trigger in a slow market, you could have zero tax consequence from the manoeuvre; but you would still have to report the transaction.  
That's what makes purchasing from your USD Wallet so much better. You can read again my original post about exactly how to do that.

Why is bitcoin.org still calling 0.9.3 the latest version for download -- except for the Ubuntu/Linux PPA iteration, that recently updated to "0.9.4"?  Isn't 0.10 still in testing on github only -- that is, not yet for full public release?

  This is by far the easiest way to do it. And the *official* way of bitcoin.org
You just install the bitcoin PPA, download and install the component(s) you want, and ALL the updates take care of themselves AUTOMATICALLY as part of Ubuntu's regular updates.
As OP mentioned, you can install bitcoind alone, without the -qt wallet -- if you only want to run a full node (without the wallet).

Another route that works GREAT.. Start a fiat account in your Coinbase umbrella account - for example, a USD account -- which is like an insured saving account that earns no interest. Then fund it by ACH transfer as you normally buy bitcoin directly. Then when you want bitcoin instantly, you can buy from your fiat account and it goes in a flash. With this procedure, you fund the fiat account with ACH transfer, then from the balance you carry there you purchase your bitcoin instantly.

It's right in their TOS. Looks like you missed checking there. If *anything* goes wrong with your order, the ONLY thing you'll get is an in-store credit to buy something else from them. No refund of any kind, so you can take your purchase elsewhere.

Nothing says it better than the first use case in this list: 
Correction: To these earners of bitcoin, it's not a 30% loss; it's a 30% premium. It's what they have to and are willing to pay in their own circumstance. If you'll look outside your small world of personal experience in the *developed world*, you'll find there are lots of people whose circumstance makes even a 30% premium seem like a good deal to them.

Lower processing fees is a major incentive for businesses taking bitcoin. Twisting their arm to give a bitcoin discount.. see what that does to the incentive?  Which would you rather have? 1000 businesses that all give tiny bitcoin discounts, or 10,000 businesses that don't?

Thanks for the clarification about how one can use this wallet.

**This title is very misleading!** What does "Bitcoin Charity" mean? It certainly *doesn't* mean 'charity to accept bitcoin'. There are now lots of those, and the number is growing fast! Especially with the efforts of BitPay, and now even Coinbase. And "First IRS Tax Exempt"? Tax exemptions are granted by states, not the IRS. The IRS only recognizes some exempt organizations as also approved for tax-deductible contributions. That's what this story is about: BitPay's receiving the coveted 501(c)(3) designation, so that donors can get tax-deductions for their contributions.

What better way to cash out those Amazon gift cards you got for Christmas! :D 
Bitcoin merchant CardCash was so awash with inventory after Christmas that they ran a promotion of an extra 5% off all their printable (electronic) cards - that's on top of already high card discounts and automatic 2% for paying with bitcoin! And, if you pay for a printable card with bitcoin, they fire it back to you *really fast*. Their discounts run circles around Gyft and e-Gifter.
@_date: 2015-01-20 02:42:31
Not presented with option to use a gift card for the purchase. Just like the fine print on this card says you can't use it to buy a gift card.  I've had that issue with gift cards before.. using a gift card to buy a gift card.  I would guess you can use the eBay/Gyft card for most anything on eBay.. *except* other gift or prepaid cards, like this one.
@_date: 2015-01-03 15:32:51
CardFlip is a GREAT little company to show some bitcoin love! They're not all slick and super fancy like Gyft and eGifter. But they are reliable and have GREAT customer service.  Some of their cards do have BIG discounts -- plus the 3% for buying with bitcoin. Other cards have only small discounts, but tack on the bitcoin discount and it really adds up.  From time to time I can find a Shell gas card there. *All the time* I buy Walmart cards there for all our household purchases, and for our daughter, too.  Even with paying 1% for my bitcoins through Coinbase, this is a real no-brainer.
@_date: 2016-01-07 16:17:41
The taxman is no problem for customers of Coinbase. We can elect to have CB do an immediate buy and send of bitcoins we want to spend. We the customers have no *constructive receipt* of the bitcoins. Hence absolutely no income tax reporting requirements. This works splendidly.

Best reason not to do this? All but 10TB will be wasted space as soon as we enter Test Group C (any day now). The project allowed very large storage blocks during early development. Now they're dropping it back to a much smaller limit, looking to involve more small farmers, rather that a few that are very large.
The friend should just get involved now with whatever storage he has in surplus on his present equipment. Storj does not recommend buying any new hardware at this point. And rewards during project development are not even paying for electricity to participate.

On the Purse.IO question only.. Purse is essentially a marketplace of bid and ask re:bitcoin. And many of the bidders are of the most disadvantaged in the bitcoin economy; so they're willing to bid really high exchange rates just to trade their exchange currency (usually Amazon gift card balances) for bitcoin. The askers of the marketplace know this and tend to ask high exchange rates for the bitcoin they have. Hence the very high prices you see there on the order book.
Once you get some bitcoin elsewhere - I'm assuming you can do that all right - Purse is a *great!* place to spend some for Amazon products... super cheap.

Good advice. One caveat related to your first note: Placing small orders to tap the universe of new earners is oft-times accompanied by an off-putting consequence - the one picking up the order is a newbie just dabbling with the system, and not serious about following through on the order process. When possible, I make my orders for &gt;$100, just to be sure they're picked up by someone with at least some positive user experience.

Have you checked out Purse.IO? They support buying Amazon merchandise directly with bitcoin in the UK.  They have great service, and you can easily get 20% or more in discount. There's no reason to buy cards from eGifter or Gyft for 3% off, when you can get *at least 5%!* on a super-fast turnaround from Purse.
@_date: 2016-01-08 12:10:45


No, you buy the Netflix card from Amazon. A brand new NF card just like you can buy in your local gas station. But the transaction runs through Purse - so you pay with bitcoin that ends up in the hands of someone else who can use them, too.
@_date: 2016-01-07 12:08:43
That means the person wanting to buy Amazon merchandise wants to get the order at a substantial discount. So when he/she set the discount wanted (on the flagship Name Your Discount plan), that translated to an $893 exchange rate. So that is the effective exchange rate the other party will have to pay if he/she chooses to pick up that order. Of course, the $893 is above current 'market price', so the other person will pay a premium for the bitcoin they buy. The % discount for the buyer and % premium for the earner are the same.

M'thinks you know little about how Purse works. The 5% discount with Prime shipping is available on their new Instant buy program. But their older Name Your Own Discount program is still vibrant with lots of users -- both buyers and sellers. It offers MUCH larger discounts. And I often have orders of 20+% shipped to me in 2 days with this program, too! There is no reason for any bitcoin spender to settle for Purse's 5% Instant program, unless they just *have to have* the 2-day guarantee.
As described, your proposed service offers nothing better than Purse's legacy NYOD service. And they have won and held that turf for several months already.

Money back in bitcoin has been the clamor of only scammers and fools. But there are plenty of us around here who would have gladly taken a refund of ANY kind - check-in-the-mail, CC or PP refund, etc. - so we could take our purchase elsewhere.

I think I understand your situation:
* You have an account with a bitcoin exchange in Korea, and an account with an exchange in the US; and,
* You want to use bitcoin to send funds from Korea to the US.
Here's what you do:
* Get your fiat into the Korean exchange and order them to buy bitcoin with it there;
* Send your bitcoin from your Korean exchange account to your US exchange account;
* Order your US exchange to convert from bitcoin to dollars; and
* Withdraw the dollars from your US exchange.
You do not *need* another wallet to accomplish the transfer. Just that it is unwise to hold a significant bitcoin balance (if you have one) in an exchange account. That's not considered as safe as *holding* your bitcoin in your own software wallet (*i.e.* MultiBit or Electrum), where you fully control the private keys.

You understand it well, I think. Where one can buy bitcoin for himself at 1%, and needs merchandise that Amazon sells, this is such a win-win situation. Purse Instant and Name Your Own Discount of up to 8% (I think) both get you Prime delivery, which is very fast. Much higher NYOD discounts take a little longer to receive. It's a good trade-off.
@_date: 2016-01-02 12:35:45
Sounds like you're what Purse calls a 'buyer', not a seller. You're not selling your bitcoin there, you're buying Amazon merchandise.
Caveat: If you bought your bitcoin in your Coinbase account, you cannot sell it directly to another party - as in LocalBitcoins and other venues like that. It's in the Coinbase TOS. But that's a slippery slope, anyway. It's much better to just just buy things with your purchased coin - and give some away to worthy causes.
@_date: 2016-01-02 21:16:03

Especially outside the confines of our own little USofA, there are lots of people with no better way to trade their Amazon gift card balances (which they cannot use) for bitcoin (which they can). I know, it's hard to wrap our affluent brains around that possibility, but it's truth.

Just tell them the truth. *IF* you have a use history to back up your case, they will probably grant your request.
Of course, you don't have to wait on a slow ACH system for having all the 'instant buying power' you could ever want. Just open and fund a fiat account with them. They'll replenish that with ACH transfers. But you can spend any amount you want from that account (up to its full balance), and those transactions will happen instantly, no questions asked.

Well said. It's too bad you don't have that in a FAQ somewhere, so we whose eyes see all the complaining here could point folks to some *official* answers -- not just explanations of our own.  
You know.. it's too bad Coinbase doesn't have a better FAQ page somewhere that deals with many of these common issues.  Of course some people will complain "it isn't so", even when something's plainly explained on a company web site.  But it would help to at least have something there to which we could point folks.

When you saw you were not going to be there to confirm delivery when your shipment was set to arrive, did you communicate that and apologize to the earner ahead of time, so they weren't just left hanging and fretful that they had not yet received their bitcoin? In the couple of times I've had delay situations like yours, I've done that - and found the earners sympathetic and understanding enough to not mark me down.

To sell or to buy the cards? If you want to buy them for bitcoin, Amazon-Purse is hands-down the best place.  I don't know who will pay you bitcoin for cards you want to sell.  CardCash is a great place to sell your cards for cash. They let buyers pay for cards with bitcoin - an a 2% discount! - but they won't pay you bitcoin for your cards.

OK. Thanks. To be clear, in the jargon of Purse, a buyer is one who spends his/her bitcoin for Amazon merchandise, and an earner is one who pays for the buyer's wish list order with fiat or a credit/gift card balance in order to receive the buyer's bitcoin. So, you're a buyer - wanting to replenish your bitcoin as soon as you know what the exact transaction cost you (in bitcoin), right? 
You're trying to do a difficult task. The exact amount (in bitcoin) of your purchase gets put into the Purse escrow when the earner submits payment for your order. That's the time-event that marks your actual cost in bitcoin. And, if all proceeds normally with the order - shipment, confirmation, and release of escrow - that remains your actual bitcoin cost. However, if anything goes wrong and that normal order process is aborted, the order gets cancelled and returned to the order book, and the escrow gets returned to your wallet.. until the next earner comes along to pay for the order.
This is why you're attempting a pretty daunting task. Do you jump to replenish when the order payment is escrowed for the first earner, or do you wait till all is complete and the final escrow is released? There's no easy answer.
Here's what I do. I believe from my experience that dealing with Purse is a long-term proposition for me. So I forget all the exact timing of replenishment amounts tied to order processes. I just replenish my bitcoin whenever I make deposits to my Purse wallet, and that's it. Eventually, I might withdraw a bitcoin balance from the Purse account, and that might require some special 'replenishment' accounting. But for all the order activity between now and then, it's pretty simple.

You can do this with Coinbase. You put money in a fiat account with them - like USD. Then when you want to send bitcoin to someone, you set it up so Coinbase buys the bitcoin for you from your fiat account and instantly sends it to the address you want. The bitcoin never touches your account, really, so you have no tax reporting requirements (in the US) for the transaction. It works very well.

The transaction is reversible clear up to the moment the buyer confirms receipt of the order and Purse simultaneously releases the escrow to the earner.
Once the order is completed (and thus, irreversible) you can find your USD and bitcoin cost this way: Click on your account name (upper right on the Purse window), then Wallet, then Transaction History (left lower). You will find there the bitcoin spend on each order and the link to see the USD amount for the order.

Again, good work here. Thanks for posting.
Maybe just one thing I would say differently. You keep mentioning that by choosing higher discounts on the flagship Name Your Own Discount program, "there is more risk of people trying to commit fraud." I think the truer statement is, "there is more likelihood of issues with the order." For a tentative, prospective new user, the *risk of fraud* terminology sends up all kinds of red flags; I think it's misleading and unnecessary.
The only fraud I've read about in Purse topics is that of folks using fraudulent gift cards, and Purse closed the door on new orders for gift cards a few days ago. There are still some old orders on the board, but those are now designated with the card icon and working themselves off the order book rather quickly.
So it is that now -- and perhaps, always -- the more basic problem with higher discount orders is just that they present more issues to resolve and delays in order delivery. Fraud may be one of those issues, but it seems to be fading fast as Purse and Amazon come up with better ways to address it.
I think the much larger disincentives for choosing higher discounts are: 
1) It takes longer for a buyer to step up on the other side of the exchange, agreeing to pay a larger premium for the bitcoin he/she wants to acquire. Purse is a marketplace; why should an "earner" (in their new terminology) pay a higher premium for a merchandise buyer's bitcoin, when there are other orders he could pick up with a lower premium?
2) Those orders are more frequently picked up by poorly scored users (already rated down because of problems with previous orders), or first time users just dabbling in the service, not really intent on following through with the order process or paying for one's order. In either case, Purse Customer Support will step in and make things right, so that a user's merchandise order and escrow deposit of bitcoin are not really *at risk* at all.  It just takes time (and usually some correspondence), to resolve.

I think Purse has explained before that tax for an order is nearly impossible to calculate when a merchandise buyer posts an order, and they presently don't have an algorithm that will automate that process. The buyer can select to add shipping to the order, but not tax. So tax cannot be added to the order, expect by Amazon, at the actual point of sale. That's just how the system works. For earners starting to pick up an order that turns out being from a high-tax state, that is a problem - like you mention. Then you just have to decide case by case whether you want to go ahead with the order or cancel out on it and look for another with a more favorable total premium.

Thanks. I'm fine with ordering the plastic. You know, we buy Walmart gift cards all the time at CardFlip. And we often travel where we can buy gas from Walmart. By special request, they sometimes will post up some Shell cards.  Both for 6% off with the bitcoin discount.  
But this is nothing compared with the discount on Purse. Thanks again for mentioning this. I'll make my first order tonight. Just $25 once, to try it. Then more later. (I just got $200 of Shell cards from CardFlip, so it will take me some time to work through that inventory, anyway.)

*Not true.* No bitcoin ever arrives in the account of companies like this. They all convert their bitcoin payments to fiat, through the likes of BitPay or Coinbase. So they lose nothing in refunding fiat for orders gone wrong. And the buyer with bitcoin has no way to game the system, either.
The company prices their items in fiat. Customers wishing to pay in bitcoin are invoiced in bitcoin at the then current exchange rate. Payment is made in bitcoin and converted immediately to fiat before it arrives as such in the merchant account. If the customer needs a refund, he should be paid in fiat, just as if he'd paid originally in fiat. 
These companies are really fleecing all of us who want to purchase with bitcoin. They're happy to take our coin. It brings them sales they might not otherwise have, and they pay no transaction fees. Then, if the sale goes awry, "Oops, we'll just keep your money and make you buy something else from us." It's a huge deception and affront to our community.

Wow. I don't know. I don't think so. But I do remember depositing only the specified amount with my first order or two, and at least once I had to top up my balance; or at least it showed me short and I topped it up just to be safe. I don't recall. Maybe this can happen on one's first order(s) until you get some account history.. something like having that restricted discount on your first Name Your Own Discount order. Yes?

Coinbase.. and hold some fiat in a USD Wallet there.  Then you can buy any amount instantly from that USD Wallet.  Works great.
From time to time you replenish your USD Wallet with the ACH transfer from your bank. No matter if that takes a few days. Your purchases are instant, and your USD Wallet balance is held in an FDIC-insured account.
With Coinbase, you can also do an instant buy back of all your bitcoin spends.. just buy from your USD Wallet each time. And you don't have to keep track of any of your those spends and buys for your IRS filings.

I'm a great fan of Purse myself. Use it all the time to buy things on Amazon. I thought this was a great video. Better than your previous one (about fees) -- that I thought strained a bit on the gnats, trying to parse out the most effective discount rate. You found redemption in this video, though, when you explained that a little more and even showed going to the *Earn* button to see what the current activity rates are on the service.  Good work.

It doesn't have to be that way. Companies that use a service like BitPay or Coinbase to immediately turn their customer payments from bitcoin into fiat, should make those same fiat dollars available to refund the customer, just like they would if they paid with fiat in the first place. There is nothing complicated or unreasonable about that, and it doesn't depend on the company holding bitcoin on account.
I'm not saying companies should give refunds in bitcoin. That's another whole can of accounting worms that a company would reasonably want to avoid. But, returning held fiat to the customer presents no issue at all to the company. Their refusal to do that is a veritable insult to all of us who would want to support their decision to accept bitcoin.  They take our bitcoin and save on transaction costs. Then they refuse to release a refund in the fiat they received at POS? You have to be kidding!

In its beginning days, Purse had 1 set of issues, all coming from a police cell in Germany that was trying to scam the system. As soon as they got to the bottom of it, Purse pulled the plug on the operation and put significant safeguards in place to keep it from happening again. Those, together with the safeguards Amazon has.. together those have rendered no further issues.  This is all documented in posts, writings and interviews with Purse -- all linked to here in reddit, if you want to do some looking.

5% is for their newer Instant program. Their signature Name Your Own Discount program can give you up to 50% off.  Though they say the average is 20%. I typically get 25-30% on my orders, but I usually don't mind waiting a few days for someone to pick them up.  The average 20% on NYOD with usually get you the same speed of service as buying the merchandise directly for your own account.

@_date: 2015-07-16 16:09:06
Great point! Larger discounts are often picked up by newer folks that have limits on how much they can transact each time. Level 1 starts at $50, so orders at less than that can be picked up by anyone.
Come to think of it, I usually place smaller orders for higher discounts, too. Even though I have a Prime account and order only Prime merchandise, I find many higher-discount orders are picked up by folks without Prime, too; and that slows down delivery sometimes. But I order smaller amounts and manage my lead times well, so I need very little in a rush. Even at 30%, I' received all my orders in 8 days or less.

Have you tried breaking down your large order into smaller ones? I've found my orders for larger discounts are more quickly picked up when they're for $50 or less. That way, even the Level 1 Earners can bid for them. And, the more eligible bidders, the better.
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:21:36

Like you said, it's a tradeoff of degrees. I would guess that many people that have only a Coinbase wallet are mostly content with long term storage in Vault; but people uneasy with using only an online wallet would not want to do long term storage there. I should think that, as you get more comfortable in the bitcoin universe, you'll be looking to branch into having also a software wallet and other secure offline storage (like paper wallets).
I love using Coinbase for buying and transaction ease with spending. But I use a software wallet, too, and have my long term savings in paper wallets.

It seems to me that MultiBit has been upfront about that, even throughout the long development phase.

Purse asks for the minimum required deposit at the time of the order. If you deposit only that amount, you're liable to come up short if the market price goes down. Then you'll have to top up your account to keep your order active. That's why it's best to always round up on their initial deposit requirement.
As you get more comfortable with the service, you'll likely round up by larger and larger amounts. I started that way. Now I just keep a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin in my account there, to cover any order I might make. Then I top off my balance from time to time, instead of having to add bitcoin with every purchase.
@_date: 2015-08-06 17:44:03
DSS, maybe you didn't see the word *Estimated* next to those fill times? If you're unhappy with them, just find your own percentage 'sweet spot' for your orders. It's not that hard to do. If you list an order at too high a discount and it's taking too long to fill, just modify your order discount down 5% or so, and keep doing that till you get your fill. Then you'll have a better idea where to start your asking on the next order.
As Purse continues to grow, its marketplace is not the thinly traded and volatile place it used to be. There will be fewer and fewer fills a big discounts, and more of the orders picked up for large discounts will be dropped before you get your merchandise.

It's not "stop loss orders", it's orders to stop losses.

IMHO This doesn't have much utility, really. Not when an Amazon shopper can already buy anything in their store with bitcoin, and get it with a LARGE discount - through Purse.IO.  Every bitcoiner with an Amazon account should be buying through Purse.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:39:07
Purse does not have 30+% discounts. They have 30+% "asks" - in the language of marketplace. Each one must be matched by a "bid" for its same amount before a "sale" is initiated. That's a small part of what I mean about knowing how a marketplace works.
As for why so many of those get cancelled by Amazon, that's only anecdotal non-evidence based on the notorious unreliability of reddit complaints. Really.

No. Purse and Amazon debunked that story a long time ago. The naysayers and detractors keep brandishing that lie around on this forum. But it's not true.

Also available with Coinbase: Add a USD wallet and transfer money from your bank account into that.

That said, if you try to order only Prime items and the buyer has a Prime account, that does tend to expedite orders.
You want to use the standard Name Your Own Discount program with Purse, not the Instant program. Instant limits your available items and your discount to 5%. NYOD is usually a bit slower, but it allows you to make an initial order for 8% off and subsequent ones for up to 25-30% or more.
The lower your discount, the faster the shipping, as a rule. But I've made a lot of orders for 25-30% and received them all in 2-8 days. And Purse has excellent customer service.

I'm sorry. I guess we're talking past each other. The link you posted only shows Purse as more expensive because their price includes a 9% CA sales tax, where the Prime price does not. That's apples to oranges, not apples to apples. Stretching the truth to *show* an outcome you've already decided you want to *see*.

This works super well.. to keep the software updated automatically to the latest version. And don't forget, you can run the daemon without the wallet, and contribute to the network with a full time full node.

Thanks. Very helpful.
@_date: 2015-07-05 21:29:40
To get a higher discount, one needs to complete a first order at only 8% (I think it is). Then after that you can set the discount to any higher amount you wish.  I routinely set my discount for 25-30% and have received all those orders in less than a week.  Delivery speed is much dependent on whether you buy Prime items or not, and whether the person picking up your order has a Prime account. Lacking that on either end, the order will ship with *normal* - not expedited - speed, once it is picked up.
Keep in mind.. Purse is a marketplace with buyer and seller competing for the best deal they can get. Higher discount/premium - especially for orders &lt;$50 - is a magnet for mostly new buyers to pick up; and they on average have lower performance scores than the seasoned buyers that will pick up orders with lower discount/premium. You can always check the order book you're competing against by clicking to Buy bitcoin and sort by your country.
My suggestion for any new person is.. get your feet wet gradually. Smaller orders first, till your confidence grows and you feel comfortable with even larger purchases. Purse is an amazing service, but it's a whole new paradigm with lots of stuff to learn and experience differently than any other shopping experience one is used to.
@_date: 2015-07-29 17:51:40
Oh, I don't know. Maybe they're happy enough having Purse around to handle purchases from all the bitcoin enthusiasts (except for that small but very vocal group of FUDsters). I know I am one enthusiast who would never spend my bitcoin directly with Amazon, when I can do it through Purse for large discounts and still good service.

That's a 7-month-old post on reddit, by a fellow who offers no substantiation of any kind from a trusted media source. We all know *anyone* can post *anything* on reddit. To keep on referencing this story as if it had even a modicum of credibility, is absurd. The only reason to keep on doing it is to continuing sowing FUD -- Fear Uncertainty Doubt -- about a legitimate business like Purse.
EDIT: Oh, and that Coinbase story you mentioned elsewhere.. the dateline and text of the article puts this event at more that a year ago now. Hardly a news flash we need to make sure everyone know about. Do you think?

Just as bad. Already at least Newegg and TigerDirect refuse to refund ANY money on orders paid with bitcoin that went awry.

Why do we care about this anymore? PURSE.IO is where we all should be buying Amazon stuff with bitcoin - ALREADY! Why would you pay Amazon their regular price on merchandise, when you can get it just as fast and with a 20% discount on Purse?
@_date: 2015-07-29 23:07:26
Your  point. Information: On order book of the newly updated Purse site, gift card orders are clearly marked with a new icon in the right hand column. It looks like a credit card with magnetic strip; but it signifies a gift card.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:52:40
Yes and no. The order mechanism is the same. Except that they're recommending you set the NYOD discount at 10% or less, so that your order will be picked up right away - before it slips out of Amazon's special Prime Day discount window. If Amazon offers the real barn-burner discounts on some items that they're expected to do, this could amount to some VERY LARGE savings. Perhaps much more than one would get ordering the item at 20-30% off and having it slip out of the sale window before someone picks it up.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:41:34
If you'll read all the thread you cite, you'll see that post was clearly and shown to be FUD from the outset.
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:14:24
Purse is a marketplace. People want to spend bitcoin; people want to buy bitcoin. Purse puts them together.  The spender get a discount on his Amazon order; the buyer pays a premium for his bitcoin purchase. It's a really cool business model, really, and serves our bitcoin community proud.
@_date: 2015-07-16 14:52:53
Good question. I don't really know. I do always select Prime items. Maybe that makes a difference somehow. And I always choose the 1% initiative.

My node experience is no different that it was before. I rent a VPS with WeLoverServers, and I have the same 90-100 connections I always have. I run another node on my local PC [3 years old, medium spec], and have no noticeable slowdown with it, either. I run a litecoin node simultaneously on the same machine, and use it for other user tasks, as well. No perceived difference.

That's the point, though. You don't get them at the same price through Purse. With Purse Instant, you get it guaranteed delivered as fast as buying yourself with Prime -- and you get an extra 5% discount with Purse. If you go on to use Purse's flagship Name Your Own Discount program, you still get super-fast deliveries if you specify a 10-20% discount. I often get deliveries in 2-3 days, even ordering at 20-25% discount!. Really. You should take a look at this.
@_date: 2015-07-12 20:51:33
If you ever buy anything from Amazon, you should seriously check out Purse.IO. There you can pay for your merchandise with bitcoin and get a 20+% discount. I use it all the time.
@_date: 2015-07-28 10:23:14
I'd say this is probably pretty far down any development list. My guess is that has to do with the need to update, with manual stops and restarts.
Even so, I don't think there's much advantage in running it as a service, anyway. Just download bitcoind only (not the wallet) from the PPA (so it will update every time there's a version change). Then run the *bitcoind* from a command prompt. That runs the daemon only (without wallet). You can even close the command window after the program starts.. and there, you have it running just like a service.
@_date: 2015-07-14 18:46:14

My cautionary tale about another company:
**PSA: NEVER spend bitcoin at TigerDirect**
I will never again buy merchandise from a company without scrutinizing their TOS for this insane duplicity! All bitcoin merchants are NOT created equal. We need to stop patronizing all who will gladly take our bitcoin payments, only to refuse us any reasonable accommodation if/when they screw something up on their end and it be otherwise normal and good customer service policy to refund us our money.
It's not *merchant adoption at all cost*. For companies like Newegg and TigerDirect, it's *theft by merchant* by whatever device suits.

You can already get 6% off at Walmart -- with bitcoin.  Buy a Walmart gift card at CardFlip.com. The card has 3% off, and you get an extra 3% off by paying with bitcoin.  I've bought a lot of cards from them. It works great. In IL we get another 10 cents per gallon off gasoline at Walmart, when paying with a gift card.

Do you mean, like a withholding tax for *assumed* capital gains? I don't think that is likely. Brokerage firms don't do that now, even for stock sales that have appreciated a great deal. Of course the government could get a lot more confiscatory in their tax policy or enforcement. But such a withholding tax would be very hard to manage. Even now, Coinbase does no 1099 reporting of sales, as none are required by law yet; that seems to indicate they're not rushing to report more than they need to to the IRS. Of course, that could change, too.

Generally, just like they are if you order directly and pay yourself for an Amazon order. You can check out the Amazon policy on their web site. I've only had one item I've ever needed to return.

Can you document this claim, please? It sounds very suspect! About two weeks ago Purse announced they were stopping all future sales of gift cards on Amazon.

That's exactly my point. In my case, I ordered and paid for a product they couldn't deliver for weeks on end, even though they acknowledged it was sitting right there in their warehouse. I needed the product when I ordered it, not whenever they'd happen to get their act together enough to send it to me. Finally I gave up and decided to take my purchase elsewhere. Is that not what any *reasonable man* might do in that situation? It doesn't strike me as disingenuous at all.

I run 2 full nodes, and I wouldn't have to. I don't use a wallet that needs them. One is on my home computer and one on VPS. On one I average 40 connections; on the other, over 100. For one I pretty much pay nothing - I'd leave the computer running 24/7 anyway, to run BOINC projects. The VPS costs me about $60 per year. 
I don't mind running these. I rather enjoy it. I don't plan to stop any time soon. I figure my bitcoin experience is not all about what I can get out of it; rather, it's what WE the community and world can get out of it. So I don't mind at all doing some giving along the way.

Nothing at all hidden from users. The person with bitcoin to spend makes an order from Amazon and deposits bitcoin payment in Purse escrow. Person with gift card or credit card picks up the order and pays for it. When it's received by buyer, Purse releases bitcoin to person that paid for the order.
Bitcoin spender has his Amazon order paid for by other party, who is then reimbursed with the bitcoin of the first person.

@_date: 2015-07-14 19:28:16


Well, there's this.: The *GREAT TIP* about how to make this work for you!  Left on our own, most of us would think.. Well, if Amazon's offering the item for 40% off, let me order it for my regular 30% discount on Purse, and I'll get it for a total of70% off!
But we'd miss remembering that at our 30% off on NYOD, if a buyer didn't pick it up right when it was in the Amazon special pricing window, he would never pick it up after that, and we'd lose everything. And no buyer is going to pick up an order for 30% off, just when the market's offering a ton of orders at 10%.
Purse's recommendation that we set the NYOD at only 10% nearly guarantees we get it at that 10% discount on top of whatever Amazon is offering.
@_date: 2015-07-09 15:36:34
Mostly to hedge my bets, I have bought and used some Litecoin. The more the bitcoin devs argue about the blockchain size (and other significant changes), the happier I am to have some money in a coin not complicated by all this drama.
@_date: 2015-07-23 13:51:12
A great way to get fast Coinbase purchases is to open a USD Wallet with them, and hold there any amount you might use in the near future to buy bitcoin. Your fiat wallet balance is held in an FDIC bank. So, from time to time you replenish your USD Wallet with an ACH bank transfer -- no rush needed. Then, when you want to buy coins, you do that with an instant transfer from the USD Wallet. None of this costs you extra, and you don't need a CC to do it with.

I'd be curious to hear from someone who's used Coinbase's 'Instant Exchange' with Purse Instant. I use it all the time for spends on Coinbase and it works splendidly to erase market risk from those transactions. But I wonder if there is any slippage when pairing it with Purse Instant.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:12:43
Frankly, your story is not very believable. If you bought with Purse Instant (5% discount) and received the shipper email telling you the point of origin and expected delivery date for your shipment more than a week ago, why have you not contacted the shipper or Purse directly? Why are you asking here on reddit?
Purse has a Contact Support button right on your order page, and they will get back to you within hours if you send them an inquiry. They're a stand-up company. They'll make sure your case is resolved reasonably. Of course people have had problems before, with these like any other merchant orders. But a little patience, level-headedness, and direct communication go a long ways toward satisfactory resolution.
@_date: 2015-07-29 22:59:52
Your  point about the 5% discount does surprise me a bit. I never use it myself. I always use the legacy Name Your Own Discount program. But I'm surprised you mention any value conversion risk in the Instant program. I thought those transaction are in fact Instant, and thus there's no chance of value fluctuation before the posted order is picked up by a buyer - like there is with NYOD.
And you say 'generally safe.' Since Purse is the buying agent for these orders, aren't they 'always safe'?
@_date: 2015-07-14 01:09:48

Bitcoin won't help you with the exchange rate, but it will help you get funds to the US more cheaply. It will take some work, though.

Common error. You checked on Purse Instant, which gives only a 5% discount. Look at their standard Name Your Own Discount program. With it, your first order is restricted to just 8%, but after that you can go up to the *sweet spot* of 20-30%, or even higher. I specify 25-30% all the time and get orders in less than a week.

@_date: 2015-07-10 10:15:56
If you have an Amazon account, you can do that nicely with PURSE.IO  It will cost you a significant premium on your bitcoin purchase -- just like LocalBitcoins would. But, yes, their system works and works well.
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:48:24
I'm a great fan. I've bought more and more stuff from Amazon in recent years. And when I first read about Purse.IO here, I put it aside as too good to be true. I gave it some time to see if it would 'stick.' Then decided to test the water with very small orders and discounts, ratcheting up to full deployment. I am extremely satisfied with my experience to date. And enjoy sharing the good news with others.
@_date: 2015-07-18 23:00:54
Good point. There are some items like that. But really, not that many, I don't think. Definitely not many popular items that sell well on Amazon.
@_date: 2015-07-29 20:15:11
No one's trading. The bitcoin purchasers are willing to pay the 5% or more because they 1)have otherwise illiquid gift card balances they wish to convert to a usable currency, or 2)they can't or don't want to buy at lower premiums from an exchange or outlet like Circle or Coinbase.
@_date: 2015-07-20 11:24:21
**MAJOR TROLL ALERT This post is completely bogus. Pure FUD.** One cannot use bitcoin AND gift card in the same Purse transaction, as OP claims he did. One either spends bitcoin to buy merchandise, or spends a gift or credit card to buy bitcoin.

An order from Amazon *via* Purse.IO - - for a 20% discount!
@_date: 2015-07-14 22:00:57
Yes, for a 27% discount! Don't you see that? Try that discount slider bar down at 5-10% and see what you get. And here you're on the NYOD program, anyway. Look at it on Instant. That a 5% discount and guaranteed Prime delivery time.
@_date: 2015-07-30 14:00:55


Yours is a reasonable complaint. A *caveat emptor* on that page would go a long way. When I started with Purse, there was an old post on their blog that explained this better.  And I read everything I could find before I put any bitcoin on the line to try the service myself.
Now, all I can find is this on the Support menu.  That, and of course the little red text that shows longer and much longer delivery times the higher discount that you choose. But yes, a little better explanation of things would go a long way. That's part of my site critique that I give them them frequently.  Better documentation.
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:19:08
...not store ALL bitcoins... That's more like it. All storage media have their own risks. None is *perfectly* safe. In this case, it's more an issue of access than it is of safety. Some on Coinbase is fine [for ease of transactional use], as long as you keep the lion's share elsewhere.

Thanks for the reminder.  :)
@_date: 2015-07-11 02:44:15
With Purse, there's no need for you to pay for the Prime membership. The Instant buys at 5% discount always come to you superfast, as you have now with no discount and paying for your Prime membership each year. 
On the NYOD, it's the buyer of your order having having Prime, on your order of Prime merchandise, that speeds up your delivery time. And you never know who's going to pick up your order. But set your discount at 25-30 and you should always get your order within a week. If the order's really urgent for you, you can set the discount for less or even buy with Instant. But with a little lead time management, there's no reason to sacrifice a much greater discount just to get your stuff super fast.
On NYOD, you can always set your discount high, then ratchet it down little by little till you get a buyer, if you need to. And you can always look at the order book to see what might be a reasonable rate to choose. But I think you'll be surprised at how your orders will get picked up quickly at the higher levels.
@_date: 2015-07-16 13:30:14
Actually, with their flagship Name Your Own Discount program, the user selects between 5 and 50 percent. I've found a sweet spot that works for me. 25-30%. That always gets me an order in less than 8 days.

Not to be picky, but all liquidity is not created equal. Coinbase has no problem with me sending my Coinbase-purchased bitcoins to an exchange and selling them there. It's just using companies like LocalBitcoins and BitQuick where my sales transactions are directly with buyers.
@_date: 2015-07-29 19:27:38
Oh, now that you've started, you shouldn't settle for the 5% of their Instant program. You can move to their flagship Name Your Own Discount program and save at least 20%, normally getting your merchandise just as fast.  If you don't mind a little delay, you can go to 25-30%. That's what I do most of the time, and it's worked out swimmingly for me.
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:35:47
On Purse, you create an Amazon Wish List to spend bitcoin. You use your gift card to buy bitcoin. The same party to the transaction does not do both.  
@_date: 2015-07-29 18:24:44
I've not seen published statistics by the company, but I think it's reasonable to believe a very larger percentage of orders are paid with bitcoin. If you're a Purse customer, you can log in and click on the EARN button to see the open book for orders. And it's evident there's a large number and value of orders that are for gift cards; that is, parties wanting to buy Amazon gift cards to make payments to other folks. There are some very large use cases (like Mechanical Turk) that have been written about in the media.
@_date: 2015-07-21 14:28:59
This can be an issue if you send only what Purse first shows you need to post. That, because of fluctuating value between their first calculation and when your coin arrives. The solution is to send slightly more than their first indication. Rounding up a bit, as it were.
I had this happen on an early order of mine, I think, before I learned I could send them more than they first calculated. Now I round up each time, and it's never happened again.
@_date: 2015-07-31 00:50:18
Did you know..? You can always purchase Amazon gift cards through Gyft and eGifter. You'd get a 3% discount when paying with bitcoin, and you can apply the code immediately to your Amazon account. I think others have said that immediacy is important. Maybe you just want to do that as an alternative? I know 3% is not as much as what you might have gotten on Purse, but that is an alternative if you can't use Purse to purchase those cards now.
Here's the message I see on my Purse account:
*As of today, we are disabling Amazon gift card purchases through Name Your Discount.
Existing orders and gift cards from other retailers will not be affected.
Thank you,
Maybe you can still do it Purse Instant for the 5% discount?

Some sellers are OFFERing at very steep premiums, but that doesn't mean their orders are getting picked up at those levels.  And if they're willing to pay significant premiums on Purse, it's only because that seems to them to be their best option.. for a whole ton of possible reasons.  The is still, after all, a free market.

I'm a bit concerned that the documentation for this says nothing about updating the OS or bitcoind as newer versions become available. The HDD may be large enough to handle things for a long time yet, but what about updating the software?

I LOVE this feature of Purse! I've used Amazon Smile ever since they introduced it.. to send some extra monies to a favorite charity of ours.  But this Purse partnership with BitGive and the match in addition.. It's the greatest!  Keep up the good work.  Every bitcoiner should make their Amazon orders with Purse.
I found a regular charity that matches dollar-for-dollar my contributions in bitcoin.  It's an easy choice to make, when someone doubles the good of your money spent.

I'm going to still use *Name Your Discount* in Purse -- instead of the new *Instant*. The steps of this article still work with the old standard -- Name Your Discount -- and the savings are many times greater!  I can sacrifice a few days on my Amazon deliveries to get A LOT more off each order.

This is very old, inaccurate and misleading information!  Save the Children and American Red Cross do not offer bitcoin donations on their web sites -- only through some obscure pages that BitPay set up for them several months ago.  As best I can tell Elizabeth Ploshay has not been on the job with BitPay for, again, several months now.  And charity adoption of bitcoin has slowed to a virtual crawl!  I've only seen four new ones on board since Dec '13.
We do have some great non-profits that accept bitcoin donations right on their web sites. It's too bad media outlets like the WSJ choose to regurgitate old stories to fill space.

I'm not sure how See Change does it, but BitPay allows payment recipients to choose whether to convert deposits to USD or leave them in bitcoin. So international charities like this can choose to leave all or part of their bitcoin donations in bitcoin, to transfer directly to their global point of service. And even if an organization chooses to convert all donations to USD -- a great way to avoid *their* currency risk (with bitcoin's volatile value) -- they can always convert holdings back to bitcoin for the send abroad.

I've seen a lot of people wait and wait till they had *that perfect setup* before getting started -- and never get started.

@_date: 2015-04-23 21:28:00
Thanks for keeping us posted on news from Purse.  I have questions about regular (non-Magic) orders to spend btc.
* Why is there a balance left in my account after my escrow is emptied (after I've confirmed delivery)?
* I read you use the exchange rate when an order is accepted (picked up), not when you invoice me at the beginning to add a specific amount of btc to my account to cover the order. Does that mean I'm at risk to have to add more bitcoin to my account if the price moves down after my initial order and deposit? What happens if the exchange rate goes up before the order's picked up?
* Could you explain better all the *funny math* that goes on with the numbers in my account?

What about **bitquick.co**?  They are super fast and convenient, and charge only 2% for buys.  You pick the price/exchange rate of offers.
A lot of people with Amazon accounts are also using **purse.io**, though their buy process is harder to navigate and the premiums are higher.
@_date: 2015-04-24 22:19:21
Transaction pickup is a supply and demand equation. If everyone's busy competing for transactions offering higher rewards/fees, ones with lower fees can get shoved aside by the masses.  ..Unless some lone minors just happen to go after them, because others are going after the bigger prizes.  It's a little like cat-and-mouse.  Is 1 enough; are 5 too many?  In general, though, the higher the transaction fee paid, the more quickly the transaction will get confirmed.
@_date: 2015-04-08 21:32:11
Is PurseInstant locked in to 8%? I thought one could set higher discounts on Purse.IO orders. Is that something different?

A great, lean way to run it without the wallet is to start it from a command prompt. Navigate to something like this: \program files\bitcoin\daemon and enter "bitcoind". If you haven't previously run Bitcoin Core the normal way, the first time you start it this way, it may prompt you to edit your .conf file. Do that once, and you're set. You have to leave open the cmd window in which you start bitcoind, but you can run other commands from a second command prompt window.  In the same daemon sub-directory, "bitcoin-cli getinfo" will give you a status update of the program and "bitcoin-cli stop" will stop it.  I run a node this was only.  The wallet side never gets opened.

Another question I didn't see in the documentation: What about needing to restrict the number of connections because of ISP policies on bandwidth usage?

The first two words pretty much say it all.

"can" Can and choose to, really. Some who have sufficient resources and could do as you do, choose not to. For reasons that seem to them sufficient, whether they would satisfy you or not. 
Services like Purse provide one more alternative for all those other folks, unlike you. I can buy bitcoin in my Coinbase account -- for just 1% and in 5 seconds -- just like you. But I cannot disparage the situation or choosing of others who can't or don't.

You should try throttling the number of connections, to cut down on usage.  "bitcoind -maxconnections=XX" works wonderfully.  Then you can let the node run full time without going over your limit. I don't think I'd leave the port open when your not running the node.
Do you use the Bitcoin Core wallet on your computer? If not, you can run just the node daemon and save some resources.  When my ISP had monthly usage limits, I found I had to run my maxconnections at about 30 to stay within the limits.  It's trial and error till you get it right.  With the big blockchain all synced up and running, 24/7 with the appropriate number of connections should let you go forward contributing all you can, month after month.

BitQuick and LocalBitcoins are not regulated exchanges. They are platforms for individuals to transact directly with each other for the purchase and sale of coins.

  CardFlip seems to have better discounts on their cards. And EVERY card bought with bitcoin comes with an additional 3% discount. Too bad they don't have many cards up on the site at times.

Look around the Help on Purse.  It's pretty clear about how to do it.  Essentially you're going to pay with your card for the order someone has made on Amazon.  Then, when they receive the order, Purse will release to you the other person's bitcoin that was placed in escrow.  The system works very well.

Your only bitcoin *currency risk* is for the period of time between placing your order on Purse and it getting picked up by someone else. Then it gets locked in. And, as OP mentioned below, currency exchange rates present possibilities for both risk and reward, depending on which way the market moves while you're exposed. In the current environment of relative price stability, I wouldn't be afraid of that at all. I've placed nearly 40 orders with Purse, and I'm within a gnat's hair of being absolutely even on my currency risk/reward.

On setting up for your purse order on the wishlist, do you also select your shipping address so that it pops up (abbreviated) on the profile page?  Your actual address should stay concealed from the buyer, anyway, if you do this. Sounds to me like you've not made that setting in your profile.

CardFlip.com is easy to set up and use.. with these caveats:
* When you get ready to checkout an order, you have to click on the little shopping cart icon in the upper right of the window. That alone will take you to a page where you can enter a Bitcoin Discount Code to give you the extra 3% off on your order.
* They've introduced different discount codes over the months I've used them. Here are the ones I've used at one time or another, and found to work: Cards4Coins -- bulk3 -- r/Bitcoin   I don't know if they all work now. I usually use bulk3, and it has always worked for me.
* They almost never have gas cards on their web inventory. But I've found this.. If I email them, we usually have at least one brand I can use, and they will work out a private offering to get it to me.
* Of course gas cards require getting the plastic card in the mail -- and tbh, I've had some trouble with their mail delivery over the months.  But other cards -- like at least Walmart and Staples -- they can send you in a pdf if you'll put that in the Special Instructions of your order. That gets the card to you much faster and more safely.  And a Walmart store can take your pdf printout and transfer the balance onto a plastic card you can use at the gas pump, and for more general convenience.
Overall, CardFlip is a little clunky.  A little rough around the edges.  But their discounts are in some cases, much better than Gyft.  They have some brands you can't get a discount card for elsewhere -- like Walmart.  And they always come through on their service guarantees.

@_date: 2015-09-10 21:50:43
If any sized order just sits there, it's mostly because the shopper is asking more of a discount than a qualified earner is willing to pay (premium). 
Of course, large orders also take earners of high Level achievements; that is, ones who have transacted more times with Purse. So it takes an experienced earner to pick up a large order; and the more experienced one gets, the more he/she figures out how to find orders with a lower premium cost on the bitcoin they want to get.
If an qualified earner wants about 80 Pounds worth of bitcoin, he'd normally prefer picking up 4 orders at 10% premium, rather than one order at 20% premium, for example. The 8-pound difference in cost will be worth dealing with 4 small orders instead of one big one.
@_date: 2015-09-11 14:50:39
Maybe you can try contacting them here at @_date: 2015-04-25 15:08:06
Purse starts you out now with just an 8% discount, and two-day turn around; but with a couple of trouble-free orders under your belt, you can ratchet that on up to much higher levels.  I've had orders as high as 22% delivered in the same 2 days time, as if I'd ordered the same merchandise directly on my own Prime account!  And you know the 8% orders are going to get to you just as fast as if you made them directly with your Gyft card.
It seems like a no-brainer to me. If you're in a hurry for an order, just settle for the 8% discount.  If you have a not-so-urgent order, ask for more discount.  ..Till you get comfortable with how things work, and how to make your orders.
@_date: 2015-04-26 02:17:54

Why are you still buying Amazon gift cards *anywhere*? If you want a discount on Amazon goods, use Purse.IO - where you can easily get a discount of 20% or more on your orders. And yes, they serve Amazon customers in the UK, too.

Sorry, I didn't read all the other posts before I replied. Glad to see you're well-pleased with the Classic version. I used it for a long time, near the end I got to really wanted an HD wallet.

"Drop shipping" may be prohibited on Prime, but that's not what Purse does. With Purse, the buyer of coin simply pays for the order someone else has put on their Wish List. And that is *exactly* the intended use of Amazon Wish Lists.
Some buyers with have a Prime account; and if they pick up and pay for an order with Prime items, the order will get the accelerated Prime shipping.  If they pick up an order without Prime items, it will go standard.  If a buyer does not have a Prime account, all items will be shipped standard.
Don't be fooled. Amazon knows exactly what Purse is does, and is just happy to be moving that much more mechandise.

Look around at the settings.  You can change it.  That can be risky, though, unless you know what you're doing.  If you set the fee too low, the transaction could take forever or never go through.  Best leave Electrum to set it for you automatically.

Not true. They have only disallowed buying Amazon gift cards. You can still buy through Purse all the other brands of cards that Amazon sells.

As far as I know, they are safe now. Purse went through a rocky time - at least here on reddit - when they were handling orders for Amazon brand gift cards. Then they stopped that, and I've not heard any complaints since. I saw the following post a while back and started getting GameStop/gas cards this way. 
I recently put in an order for a Netflix card as well. Here's a complete list of branded cards you can get from Amazon:

I've often asked for PPA support like this for MultiBit and Electurm. Unfortunately, the devs of those wallets don't seem to be interested enough to set this up. Electurm made its way into the Ubuntu repository with what's now a very outdated version. No update forthcoming on that, either.

Can't you erase currency risk already by just ordering an automated buy-back of bitcoin you sent from Circle to Purse? You can with a Coinbase account. Actually, with Coinbase, they just buy the coin you need and immediately send it to your merchant (Purse). The bitcoin never really hits your account, so you have no tax accounting whatsoever to do for the transaction.

Thanks for reporting about your call requesting a discount for bitcoin purchases. Saved my making the call. And I'm with you. By the time I pay Coinbase 1% to buy my bitcoin, then buying CardCash's selection at their native rates is not much savings at all.

One of the biggest impediments to merchant adoption of bitcoin as a payment method is the lask of a compelling case consumers would use it if they had it.

If you need any merchandise or gift cards that you can purchase from Amazon, do that through Purse. 15-20% or more. That's the premium you can get for your bitcoin; or, seen the other way, the discount you can get on the merchandise. Works like a dream!

Sounds like your shipping issue can only be solved by Purse support. No reason to ask about it here. 
But, if there's a problem with an old address on file, that's not Purse's problem. It's yours, with the address you have associated with the Amazon Wish List you're using. You should make that right before you place any more orders on Purse. You're causing a gross inconvenience to the Purse earners that are kind enough to pick up your orders in good faith, only to have you cancel them because of a mistake you still haven't corrected.

Not so. You never had a negative balance with Coinbase. When you emptied your wallet of the ill-gotten coin, you left a zero balance. Bitcoin has no means of showing negative balances.

There is no scamming of Amazon sellers, nor Purse calls "earners" now. Every earner knows exactly what he's going to get, going into the transaction. That's not scamming. Not understanding why anyone would pay a 20% premium for their bitcoin is not the same as that person being scammed.

U.S. rules require that you report capital transactions - gain or loss - whenever you *dispose* of an asset.  Your sale amount is less than the $10k that would require your bank to report the transaction. But, why take the USD out of Coinbase? Open a USD Wallet there, and have the proceeds of your sale deposited there. It's insured like your bank deposit, and it's at-the-ready to make futures purchases or spend there for merchandise.
@_date: 2015-11-16 18:18:56
 This gets you started on the many legitimate reason "earners" have for using Purse to get bitcoins.

Sounds like you have your solution then, right? Name Your Discount orders can be placed anywhere in the world - not just in the U.S., as is the case for Instant.

You need it for Armory only. There are much lighter wallets to use. Much better for laptop installation. Electrum is very popular.  If you're new enough to the arena to be asking these questions, Core and Armory are probably MUCH more sophisticated to start with than what you need.  It seems you're not much inclined to do your own reading/research on these things.. which doesn't bode well for your success with bitcoin.

That wasn't their responsibility to do. It was your bank account, hence your responsibility to know your balance and whether your Coinbase buy order would overdraft it. Then for you to immediately transfer the bitcoin to another wallet.. Coinbase was left with no other conclusion than that you acted to scam them, and they proceeded accordingly.

Not at all. You misunderstand how Purse works. Person 1 buys on Amazon through the Purse marketplace, putting his/her bitcoin in the Purse escrow. When Person 2 picks up the order and pays Amazon for it with credit card or gift card, Amazon ships it to Person 1. When Person 1 receives the order, he releases the Purse escrow to Person 2. Bitcoin go from Person 1 to Person 2, just like they might go from buyer to merchant in most other closed-loop transactions (like OpenBazaar). 
@_date: 2015-11-16 22:21:57

There are lots of other topic threads about this here. Short answer: The IRS says you have to pay taxes on your gains. That is.. What you sell them for minus what you bought them for.  If you hold them more than a year, you get the lower capital gains rate, but the sale can still be costly.  Of course, you get to keep in your pocket what the tax man doesn't take.
@_date: 2015-10-12 23:21:20

Long term capital gains are taxable income. You have to add them to all other taxable income to determine whether you have any U.S. taxes to pay.  They are taxed at a lower rate than other income, which helps when you're doing the calculation.  And you can avoid tax on long-term gains altogether when donating giving bitcoin to charity.  See

Actually, you can do all that on each individual computer. It will keep it busy, but even an old computer can probably do it well enough.

It's really pretty easy if you don't want to carry any inventory of bitcoin and take the corresponding currency risk.
1) Both parties have to agree on a price mechanism. For example, if you're used to paying in USD both parties could agree to use the Coinbase price of the USD-to-BTC exchange you do on your end.
2) You both have to agree on a point-in-time for currency conversion for payment.  For example, you could set that for 10:00 am CDT on the first of every month.
3) You deposit in a Coinbase USD wallet the amount of dollars you'll need to pay plus the 1% Coinbase charge for buying the bitcoin.  Then, when the payment hour arrives, convert all those dollars to bitcoin and send the bitcoin to your contractor's wallet.  You expense the dollars you spent for the bitcoin, and that's all there is to your accounting for it.
There are many ways to tweak this if you want to. But there you have it.

I can't wait for this to happen! The Bitcoin-Only Discounts part, that is. I started using CardCash a couple of months ago when they first started taking bitcoin payment on their web site.

But they have some pretty sizeable discounts on some cards we use. I've made about 10 orders from them so far. is the fellow developing this initiative, if you want to give him some feedback.
@_date: 2015-10-19 11:46:53
Or, different ways of executing internal exchanges. On smaller transactions, I think Coinbase does everything internally, matching buys and sells internally; whereas BitPay does not have their own customer wallets or their own exchange in which they constantly have "in house" transactions going on -- so they have to go to third party sources to execute their trades. And every pair of hands through which the bitcoin flows.. well, every pair of hands want its own cut of the pie.

Actually, the larger the order, the more likely you'll have more reliable delivery. Larger orders require higher level earners to pick them up.  I try to group items I want into orders of &gt;$100 so I don't get any brand new earner to pick it up. New earners are the ones that are most unreliable as a group.

Are you sure BitPay is not taking longer because your account volume is no longer qualifying for daily payouts?
@_date: 2015-10-10 17:22:04
Sorry for not being clear. The Litecoin client has a *minimum relay fee* of 0.001, so that transactions with an attached fee of less than this threshold are not forwarded by the network and thus do not fill up the memory pool and slow down (or potentially, crash) individual nodes.. as happens still with bitcoin. Bitcoin has work-arounds for the problem, which individual node operators can use. But Core has no default setting to address this issue.
@_date: 2015-10-25 21:22:04
Are you looking for more lightweight? I think you're only other viable option is to go with Multibit (which I prefer) or Electrum. You can run of them for your wallet and still run bitcoind as an independent service node. That works really well.
@_date: 2015-10-13 01:26:20
Sounds like that to me. Hear, Ye. Hear, Ye.
@_date: 2016-05-12 09:23:37
Point well taken. Purse bots regularly scour the order book looking for situations like this - to cancel orders with issues (like time-sensitivity, price change, and out-of-stock conditions) before they're even picked up by an earner. Sometimes an order falls through the cracks and has a mostly predictable bad outcome, like yours did. 
But indeed, Purse introduces additional links in the order chain - links than can bring issues of their own to user transactions. Placing a time-sensitive order - even with Purse Instant - is always a roll of the dice.

Oh, my friend, why not keep Core running and contributing to the network?  The hard part is behind you.. downloading the large blockchain files.  And you can set the maximum number of connections you want, to not hog system resources.
You don't even have to run the wallet side of -QT, to make things run even leaner for you.  See: 
I run mine at 30 connections, to stay within the usage guidelines of my ISP -- and I notice NO slowdown in how all my other programs run.

If you want to empty your wallet entirely, you have to consider the transaction fee that Electrum sends on top of the specified 'send' amount. Example, if you have exactly 1.0000 showing as your wallet balance, when you go to send all of it, Electrum will show you that you don't have enough funds to send it, and show you what the transaction fee is. You can reduce your 'send' amount by the amount of the fee, then the transaction will go off without a problem and your wallet will be left with exactly zero balance.

SOLUTION: Set up at USD Wallet with your Coinbase account and fund it with a transfer from your bank account. That transfer will take the usual time. But then you can order bitcoin purchases from there and they're executed immediately.  As needed, plan ahead and put more money into your USD Wallet, and you'll always have a way to do instant purchases.
@_date: 2016-05-14 17:17:48
Coinbase is a great place for newbies to start. Next, a permanent discount can be alluring. You have to give them at least 1% to offset the customer's cost for buying bitcoin. CardCash gives 2% for all bitcoin purchases. Other companies give more.   Depending on your business, maybe you count schedule some one-on-one or small group help to get folks started. And don't forget to mention GREAT discounts they can get by using bitcoin with other merchants - like 10-30% with Amazon-Purse.

Well, I've gone from carrying only a BTC balance (when that's all they had) to carrying only a USD balance. I have all my long-term HLD value in paper wallets, so I only use my Coinbase account for active transactions. 
And I discovered: 
* I can now spend bitcoin directly from my USD Wallet, as an instant purchase-and-send;
* If I make all my spending this way, I have NO TAX ACCOUNTING (capital gains) to do, since I never have *constructive receipt* of those bitcoins [Coinbase buys and spend them for me immediately, and they never actually touch my account];
* I never have to worry about managing my bitcoin inventory to maximize gains (vs. losses); and,
* I don't have to reconcile a lot of Coinbase transactions with my bank statement every month.
So, I just replenish my USD wallet from time to time (via ACH) and do instant purchases of bitcoin for all my spending. Works like a charm. GREAT use case!

If you or your friends have bandwidth issues, you can always limit the draw of these node computers. And you can double down on the good.. running a node of BOINC project on each one, too. My favorite is worldcommunitygrid.org. Even old laptops can well run a bitcoin node plus BOINC projects at the same time.

All you can really do is keep checking on the wallet balance, to make sure it's still all there.  You *can* withdraw less than the full balance, but there's a certain risk of that causing problems.
I remember having the same questions when I first ventured to do some paper wallets. So I started by sending a first tiny amount to one, then pulling it all back into my Coinbase wallet.  When I saw that went well, it gave me confidence to create other paper wallets with larger balances.
@_date: 2015-10-07 01:59:34
I have done lots of orders through Purse. I find it's a bit harder to get an "earner" for a gift card order than it is for one of merchandise. And, small orders of $50 or less have more takers, but they're often picked up by newbies to the arena--folks just playing with the system and not following through on the orders. It's always and hit-and-miss marketplace. But I'll take that any day for a consistent 20+% discount.
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:47:50
Not if you immediately buy back the equivalent amount of bitcoin you just spent. With buy-back services like Circle and Coinbase have, you can be a spender and a holder both.

The problem is with Tiger Direct. They may say they'll refund you for an order you've paid for in bitcoin. At their place of business, the right hand often doesn't know what the left hand is doing.

I. You don't have to wait for the initial sync to finish before you go to node only.  Just close the Core program, wait a couple of minutes for it to completely clear out of the system, then restart node only as described. 
II. You can limit the number of connections however you need to.  When you start the client, enter: "bitcoind -maxconnetions=XX"  ...where XX is how many connections (peers) you want.  The program automatically runs at the most connections it can, so the speed issue is likely not a connections issue; rather, it's the time the system takes to verify all the later blocks in the chain.  As soon as it slogs its way through this, all should work as expected.

Both Coinbase and your personal wallet software have functions to send bitcoins and receive bitcoins. In this case, you fire up your Multibit and click to receive a payment. It will give you a public key that you copy into your clipboard. Then you go to your Coinbase account and click to send bitcoin, which opens a dialog box where you can paste the public key from Multibit and enter the amount of bitcoin you want to send. Click to send and wait for the transaction to negociate the transfer. That's it.
Your Multibit software will instruct you how to backup to USB. Essentially, it's just copying your wallet files from your computer to the USB. Oh, and be sure your password protect your Multibit wallet.

An agent has responded to your community question. 
Exchange Rate Mechanism
Oct 28, 2013 04:23AM PDT
How to you set the exchange rates that you use for buying and selling bitcoins? Since you're not an exchange, do you take the current rate of an exchange you use, or the average to 2 or 3 major exchanges? Do you build in any risk premium for Coinbase? When I've placed orders, I've noticed your rate is sometimes appreciably different than the last price or bid/ask on MtGox and Bitstamp. Why is that?
Nick Oct 30, 2013 07:21PM PDT
We base our price on the average of a variety of exchanges, so sometimes our price differs from any one particular exchange. As the price between different exchanges stabilizes, our price will be naturally self-correcting. Hope that explains!

Currency trading with a U.S. broker, yes. Necessarily, if only because the broker gives you a 1099 at the end of the year. But few of us are "trading" and we're not using U.S. brokers on either end of the transaction. Are exchanges in Japan, Bulgaria, or Slovenia going to send us 1099s? And to what mailing address if our arrangements have been anonymous/autonomus?
So what about this situation: I buy Swiss Francs because I plan to travel to Switzerland or I think they're going to go up against the dollar; then I return and exchange some or all of them back (at a profit or loss), or exit my purely speculative position. Do I owe 988/1256 taxes on that foray? How many travelers or investors do you know that would answer that one, Yes?
In the craziest to taxation models, until we have more clarification in the U.S. it seems it be helpful to show use of at least some bitcoin to buy goods and services -- at least fortifying a position that one's using it like any other real world currency, and any increase in value has been incidental to functionality.

For folks in the USA, Coinbase is a great place to buy coin. And of course you can use their online wallet and do all your transactions from there. That's a good way to start. A good way to get your feet wet with bitcoin.
But sooner or later, as your account keeps growing and you get more involved with the currency, you'll want to take more control over your own experience. That's where having your own wallet comes in.

Re: Multibit backup. In this process you COPY your wallet files to the USB, you don't transfer them. They stay intact to use on your computer. Then if something happens to your computer, you can use the backup files to restore all the value that was in your Mutibit wallet.
So.. you don't delete the wallet files on your computer once you've backed them up to USB. If you have a secure password, they should be safe there. Safe enough anyway, if you don't have a lot of money there. No need to complicate life more than need be.

What most contributes to the intense volatility of the bitcoin price is "thin market". That is, there still aren't a lot of participants in this market.
Then, too, a disproportionate amount of those participants that we have are ones of the 'to-the-moon!' crowd. The get-rich-quick lot that pile on when the market's going up and bail out when it's going down, thus only exacerbating the moves in both directions.

Don't confuse ease and speed. Buying bitcoin with an ACH transfer from a bank account is about as easy as it gets. But it's not the fastest you can get. The price lock-in is fast, just not the trade settlement. You can get the trade settlement fast with an exchange like Bitstamp; but then you have the extra expense and delay of sending them your money by international bank wire.
Bitcoin still has its market inefficiencies; it's still a baby learning how to walk. You just have to look at all the trade-offs and decide what suits you best. For me, I use Coinbase for my small weekly purchases -- dollar-cost-averaging my investment commitment -- and Bitstamp for larger chunks I want to put in whenever the moment seems especially fortuitous.

Sounds like a good, responsible move to me. Coinbase isn't a flash-trading platform. If there's anything April's crash should have taught us all, it's.. do your deliberate buying and selling when markets are calm. When they get crazy crazy, it's time to sit back and let them go. After April's to-the-moon take-off, then crash, we had weeks and months to do our reasoned buying. We'll have weeks and months later, too. The time is just not now.

ALL is probably not a good idea. SOME might be. Bitcoin is still the closest there is to 'investment grade' crypto. Litecoin is a distant second. All others are near pure speculation.

Just buy some coin outright. Coinbase is a great place to start. Buy to hold (investing) is good. But currency is meant to be spent. You can buy a little, spend a little, buy a little, spend a little -- as still your holdings will grow in value. A good way to go.

To be clear, Coinbase is not an exchange. They must go through an exchange or other market to buy and sell bitcoin. And, as the marketplace changes, they deal with different parties. That's why their price doesn't align exactly with any one exchange, and why they may build in a small transactional and/or risk premium in the rate they use.

I'm having the same trouble verifying my ID with Coinbase. I think I've tried three times now. I think I'll try a couple more times, then contact customer service if I can't get it done the formulaic way.
Because exchanges like Coinbase are VERY busy these days, I think it probably works best to send them a single email response to a cancelation notice -- a short detail of all the pertinent facts for them to consider. Here is what I wrote:
"Would you please review this cancellation for me?  I cannot fathom a single reason for this.
"The purchase was not made in 'fast market' conditions.
I had previously made another purchase for about the same amount.
The funds were clearly in my bank account, and disbursed from there as they should have been.
My account is fully verified for this level of transaction.
There is nothing suspicious about this order or payment.
I want my bitcoins; not my money back.
I look forward to doing more and more business with you in the future.
Thank you."

Truth is.. the jury's still out on this according to the IRS. There's a strong argument to be made that you'd treat it like any other currency you exchange USD for to use to make purchases with in a distant land. You don't pay tax on any currency fluctuation on those other currencies.. not when you spend them, not when you bring some back home and convert them back to dollars. Let's wait till Congress and the IRS clarify this before we give opinion as fact. Fair enough?

In the investment world, we call this approach "dollar cost averaging". To commit a fixed amount of money at fixed intervals. For example, $50 per week, purchases every Wednesday morning. No concern for what the then current price is. If the price is up, you buy fewer units with the fixed sum; if it's down, you buy more. So in a market that's longer term flat or trending up (as this one probably is), you have a better average price paid than you're likely to have throwing everything in at once. We humans are not very good at picking the perfect moments to invest.

Why would you want to fund a traditional or rollover IRA with bitcoin?
1- If you hold your BTC as "money" outside a retirement plan, it's appreciation is not taxed anyway; in all but a Roth IRA, your withdrawals one day will be all FULLY TAXABLE, and with penalties too if you take them early!
2- This is very early in the regulatory timeline for bitcoin, to count on any present stance of tax law holding up till anyone of us here retires.
3- For all that we believe in bitcoin, it's only a fool who would throw a large portion of his/her retirement savings into something as speculative as this. Maybe good for a modest dollar-cost-averaging plan over the next few years.

IMHO That doesn't make sense, really. Past performance is not even an indication of future performance. If we talk empirical evidence, there's more to support this conclusion than there is the opposite. And chart comparisons only point to the past. If you're going to invest now, it's future performance that you care about, and charts in past tense don't really speak to that.
Don't get me wrong, there's plenty to recommend investing in bitcoin. Just not price chart comparisons.

"Opinions about taxes and the IRS aside." If we put aside opinions we're left with NOTHING on this question. Congress and the IRS have yet to publish ANY guidance on the subject.

Now we just decided to start buying $500 worth of bitcoin for each on their birthdays, instead. Any thoughts on which will prove the better investment come time for college for them? ;)

Thanks. Question answered by Coinbase documentation.

What about Multibit? Do you know what kind of wallet it is?
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:32:16
Great point.

For bitcoin news, here is great. Coindesk also has a newsfeed feature you can set up in your browser or reader ap. They catch all the bigger stories -- albeit, mostly from right here -- and send out several good ones each day.

Can't you even send it from your account there to another firm, or an account your parents have, from which the withdrawal can be made alright? Don't despair, mate. Problems are just challenges to be met.

We want folks to spend, then buy more, then spend again. Money is worth more as its velocity increases.

My favs.. 1 Bitstamp, 2 BTC-E
Bitstamp allows limit orders, and they're far easier to get your USD in and out of.

Coinbase is your best vehicle. See their post just minutes ago here.

Law enforcement enterprises will always have a stream of bitcoin confiscations to get rid of, just like they now auction off seized assets of other kinds. As long as they do this in an orderly way, it should not disrupt the market.

Always good to hear new voices. Thanks for checking in.

Wow! What a lot of backdoor fretting and work just to get your feet wet! All that and you're still not there! "..if nothing more that to understand the process.." Be done with it, then. Open an account at Coinbase, fund it with just a few dollars, and start spending them. You don't have to 'invest' a ton of money to get started directly.

Sounds like they may have their screening algorithm set a little too close. They'll get it right over time, I'm sure. Those usually take some tweaking, anyway. As long as Coinbase responds well to erroneous cancelations as they're now doing, I guess it's a bother we all can live with. Better to filter out too many transaction/accounts for "questionable" than start losing money from our accounts because someone got unauthorized access.

Sounds like you'd be well served by opening a Coinbase account to get your feet wet, then setting up your computer wallet securely once you feel more comfortable with that. All you need to start a Coinbase account is a US bank account to link it to. Then you buy bitcoin via ACH transfer, and hold or spend it with your wallet there. When you later set up your computer wallet, you can transfer your bitcoins from Coinbase to that wallet.

I don't see the problem, unless you've lost access to your Coinbase account.  If that address ever was a public key issued for your Coinbase account, then it still is and the money's there now. Just log on and see.

Just put it in your browser with an add-on. If you use Firefox, Bitcoin Price Ticker is a good one.

In the U.S., we all live in houses and on properties that were once stolen from Native American peoples. If some of our money ends up in bitcoin now, I suppose that should all be blacklisted, too. Then we could bring down the whole known universe, I guess. Right?

Sell them where you bought them. That's good for starters. If you buy them from reputable places [like Bitstamp or Coinbase in the U.S.], you can always sell them back for your native currency in that same place.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:10:59
A currency? Or capital asset? Or barter transaction? Or exempt 'personal transaction'? Maybe we're right back where we started? Interesting.

WOW! In over three months of ready everything I can, this is the first time I've heart of this!
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:58:02
Do we have an update on this project? How are you coming with the crowdnode web site?
@_date: 2013-12-13 02:27:27
To be clear.. I have an icon for starting bitcoin-qt, but not one for bitcoind. I guess I need to start that in a terminal, right? Can you tell me exactly how to do that? Sorry, I don't know more technical stuff.
@_date: 2013-12-01 23:24:37
Or, some of both strategies. That's what I do. Some fixed dollar amount every Wednesday morning. An extra reserve sitting by to put in special buy anytime the price is right.
@_date: 2013-12-16 20:33:53
Thanks so much. Is this in any "official" documentation somewhere? I'm always hesitant to take things like this on the word of another poster. No fould intented.

GREAT interview!

**It has NOT stabilzed since April!** It's just that the scale used in the 2Y chart you link to makes the continuing decline not seem as great. Click the buttons to look at the chart over all the shorter time horizons, and you'll see it's continued to plunge.
