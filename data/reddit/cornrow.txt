It needs a discount to make up for difficulty of first acquisition. People like you and me would prefer to pay with bitcoin than dollars, but that isn't true of the masses, who we need to get onboard eventually.

Thanks! We've worked really hard at it. Just had dinner with my cofounder (who's also psyched about bitcoin) and we agreed that if we weren't doing SETT, we'd be building a bitcon business.

I think it's important to remember that many government services are invisible by default. There's a reason people aren't constantly attacking you trying to steal your bitcoins, and that's because of the government. You were probably educated by the government. You can drive on roads because of the government.
Now... I also think that the government is very wasteful and I'm not really happy about where my tax money goes. But-- I'll pay it. There are a lot of reasons that I'm able to sit in my home and safely buy bitcoins, and the government is actually part of that.

When PayPal started, they gave everyone $5 for free. It was a gimmick, but was a huge success. Now they steal your money (a joke... sort of). So you can start with a gimmick, if you want to call it that, and then move away once the platform matures.

Nice! If we didn't code our own stuff, we'd use you guys.
