The way I see it; a $1000 investment will not get you 10% on any stock or mutual fund within a year let alone a month unless your luck rivals Longshot (Marvel). Let's not even talk about CD's, treasuries, or other broken financial instruments. That same 1K can easily pull .02 BTC if used properly which is well within the 10% range.

Let's not forget the 3rd evil (Porn). It will make a bigger impact than both in my opinion. No more revealing yourself to sites, spouses etc....

Then just sell all you have and just be done&gt;&lt; If your serious about this money then you know when to sell and when to buy. You never even mentioned that the volume being moved is high in light of the lower price. That is the key indicator that prices will rise once the grand sell off is complete. (whenever that maybe)
