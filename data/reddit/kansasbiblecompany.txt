mtgoxUSD might as well be Monopoly money. Their ability to process withdrawals in the United States is currently in limbo. You're putting trust in MtGox (formerly Magic the Gathering Online eXchange) to give the USD funds to you at some unknown point in the future.
This is probably a bad idea; MtGox could very well be insolvent. I wouldn't be surprised if this is slowing progress on getting the USD withdrawal and legal problems taken care of. Since they are dealing with seized funds and legal problems in the US blocking withdrawals, this buys them some time until the run on Mt. Gox occurs.

They ship from India, and there are no controlled substances as far as I can tell. Considering the latter part, the DEA probably would not have interest in taking them down; it might be more the FDA instead.

The best use for this kind of shit would be to mark the stolen Bitcoin from Silk Road users (ie at 1F1tAaz5x1HUXrCNLbtMDqcw6o5GNn4xqX) as "invalid". It has not been proven that these funds have been used in illegal activities, yet FBI steals them and says "we'll never give them back, I guess we'll auction them off after the trial". You could very well be using Silk Road for legal purposes, yet they determined that all users should have their funds permanently seized.
To me, these are as good as counterfeit USD! STOLEN AND ILLEGITIMATE MONEY!

[Investopedia page on "divestiture"](


It's common to use this word to describe a company spinning off or otherwise transferring part of their business. Sometimes they spin off business that may be more or less profitable, or in a move to focus on their main business. One of the more famous examples is the AT&amp;T antitrust case in the 1980s. Because they seemingly had a near-monopoly on the telecom market, AT&amp;T was forced to spin off their network into several regional "Baby Bell" companies.
But at this point, you probably have a bunch of people that are looking for the perfect moment to dump the BTC they have been sitting on for god knows how long!

It's up to about $25K now. 22.33 BTC. A couple of people sent him several thousand dollars (around 4-5 BTC each).

Blockchain should be forked so the FBI stolen bitcoin are (rightfully) no longer deemed as valid, or are redistributed in some other manner. This is probably the largest theft in the history of Bitcoin, and hopefully many Bitcoin users will not recognize the FBI criminals as a legitimate holder of Silk Road users' funds.

Sheep Market shut down today as a result of stolen Bitcoin. BMR began the process of winding down operations due to lack of scalability and inability to serve as large of a customer base as SR did. I wouldn't be surprised if these events lead some to "panic sell".
