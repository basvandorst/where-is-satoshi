Maybe a [paper wallet]( would work for you?

The problem with keepass is remembering to close it.

To mitigate that risk, I would only lend to someone who deals in BTC.
I think I see our impasse. You are valuing BTC against a fiat, and I am valuing BTC in and of itself. From my perspective, exchange rate isn't a risk. I am not going to exchange fiat into BTC to get the principal or do the reverse with the return. I just want more BTC.
Though, I think your position is the most correct. All business conducted in BTC is actually using BTC as a proxy for some fiat. (And currently it is a bad proxy)
As long as there are people like me; who believe in the value of BTC in and of itself, it will live on.

I use to own one of those cases.

Send the coins to your android's address instead of moving the address.

I only relay. If you are an endpoint, it is a security and legal concern.

Meh, you say instrument or commodity; I say money.
As someone who believes in an upside to bitcoin in the long term, I am probably exempted from your sane clause, but I would lend bitcoin. In the current climate, sure the value of the loan in USD may fall over the term. I will still make interest on the loan in BTC.

Well, bitcoin is still alive, so the volatility is not fatal.

When I was reviewing all of the exchanges, I think Virwox was the easiest, because you could pay in using paypal. (I already had a verified paypal account) The downside was fees. I think it came to ~5% rake after the deposit, two trades, and the withdraw. (you had to go USD -&gt; linden -&gt; BTC)
After you had a verified account on Mt. Gox and Dwolla, you can deposit and withdraw without a fee. (Actually, i think it costs $0.25 to withdraw USD from mtgox) This brings total fees to 0.5% + $0.25.

I still donate bandwidth and fiat. I do not think two million is all that much, and the less they have to rely on the US government, the better.

There is no volume of money on the other exchanges, and it takes a week to wire transfer some in. Prices on the other exchanges is going to plummet in response to a flood of bitcoins and a very small amount of fiat.

I cloned the git repo: [ 
I compiled, but it was still version 0.72. Where did you get 0.8 from? How can I trust it as a source?
