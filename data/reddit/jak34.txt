Straight up though, I have like little fractions of coin in wallets that I can't send anywhere because fees and I feel like collecting them with a large amount isn't worth because fees

Can you please explain your logic to me? I've been following thr bitcoin a long time (2013) and it has rapid spikes of growth followed by rapid declines to a minimum and then progressive/rapid growth.
Unless of course the bubble pops like it did at the end of 2013 where we saw decline for more than a year before slow steady growth.
I guess my question to you is why don't you think it's a bubble? Do you think the bitcoin / other crypto currencies continue to grow without seeing major decline?

Watched all of this happen from 2012 and can't help but feel like an idiot for not doing anything.

Seriously. The bitcoin went up like 700 in a day a couple days ago. I'm really suprised it got to 4500 so quickly.
