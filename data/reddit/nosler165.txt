Trezor customer service just verified funds were transferred out of my account. Total loss of all assets. Hackers just got 67k and I'm F'd. Hopefully they burn in hell. Beware all trezor users of my loss and hopefully this doesn't happen to anyone else. 
recap- 
I logged into [trezor.io]( clicked the firmware update link. was redirected to a fake site (Or another possibility as unrealistic as it sounds is someone at trezor is at the forefront of this scam but only time will tell if this was the case) After the 'update' I created a new pin at which point the trezor fake home account screen asked me to input my key words which I did through my trezor. Once all of this was completed I checked my balances once more and unplugged the trezor. Six weeks later I went onto my account to sell some coins and the accounts were cleared out. One transaction in my BTC account and one in my LTC account. Trezor customer service verified all funds were taken out with no chance of getting my stolen funds back. At this point I will probably contact the FBI or another department and at least open my case. Maybe this will help others not fall for the same scam. After further research I have found that hundreds of millions get stollen annually which is roughly 18% of all crypto on the market. Most people don't file charges because like me they feel hopeless of ever recouping the stollen coins so they swallow the loss and move on.
