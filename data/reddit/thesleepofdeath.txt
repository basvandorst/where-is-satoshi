I think you mean "What kills Mt.Gox, makes Bitcoin stronger."

No, and there also aren't tons of companies making trillions of dollars in revenue each year. Walmart is number 1 with half a trillion. The US gov't is 10x larger.

I hate all of the debt nonsense that just shows you some huge number with absolutely zero context. US govt revenue surpassed 6 trillion in 2015 so with a total debt amount of 20 trillion we have a debt to income ration of 3.33 and while that is somewhat high there are tons of super successful fortune 500 companies that carry just as much or even more with no issues.

3.2 is only tax revenue, as your article states. I was using  which I believe includes ALL govt revenue. 
I really cant speak on the 'unfunded liabilities' because its not really comparable to any kind of normal business. 
I'm not saying it isn't a problem. I'm saying the average person has absolutely no idea what any of this means and some stupid pie chart of different countries' total debt is meaningless without perspective.

I feel like all of his theories and points are old news I've seen debated to death already here on reddit. For the length of the article I was expecting some way more interesting information. I suppose for a gamer who isn't knowledgeable on the subject its an interesting read, although, it does seem a bit biased against the idea of bitcoin.
