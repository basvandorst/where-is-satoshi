I should have specified. The people involved want it succeed so they can make money. They want to get other people involved so they can make money from that involvement. This involvement requires them to buy the asset that these people own. Is this not sounding like a Ponzi scheme yet?

I agree. Bitcoin is on less of a "bull run" than it is a "boston marathon"

Nas owes 6.5 million to the IRS in back taxes. I wonder why he wants Bitcoins? Oh yeah, and he's invested in it, just like every other person who wants Bitcoin to succeed.

Well people who own Coca-Cola stock don't post on Coca-Cola forums talking about how it will one day replace water and they certainly don't harrass everyone they know who prefers Dr. Pepper or call up local businesses haranguing them into switching from Pepsi products to Coke products.

If you are into bitcoin to make money there is no difference between buying bitcoin or playing roulette. I think the odds of winning any one spin of roulette is better than bitcoin going up 32x its current price.

Paid shill here. We couldn't allow bitcointalk to be up during this part of our attack on the price of BTC. If the captains of industry and top minds of bitcointalk were allowed to work together they would easily thwart our plan.

You could get better odds putting that on a super longshot parlay at a sportsbet. At least you're honest about your interest in bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-10 01:14:38
well the original comment I was replying to said you were better off putting the money on roulette and getting a 32x payout. its actually 37-1 odds that a straight up bet on roulette will give you a 35-1 payout. so $1 has a 37-1 chance of you making $35. 
if you bought $1 of bitcoin right now it would need to be worth $10,395 per bitcoin for that to be equal to the same roulette payout
i guess it comes down to whether you think its better than 37-1 odds that a bitcoin will be worth $10,395. so the question is not if there will be another bubble, but will that bubble be ~10x greater than the previous high? i think if you are honest with yourself you can see that the odds (while not impossible) are nowhere near likely.

I hope no one actually thinks that any kind of citizen militia could stand up against the military. The actual issue is how are you going to get any large chunk of the military to go out and kill American civilians en masse on American soil. The military isn't completely automated, people have to fire the guns.

By the logic of "business x is accepting bitcoin!" when they are really accepting giftcards bought with bitcoin, then since bitcoin can be converted to USD, then bitcoin is accepted EVERYWHERE. 100% worldwide bitcoin adoption is already here!

Because he donates for example $1,000 and says buy me $700 in BTC and keep the rest. In that person's mind they are making $300 by being a middleman. All of the money coming from his side is from stolen CCs so any BTC he gets is free money. The person who bought the BTC with that original $1000 is going to be out the entirety of their money when the CC owner does a chargeback. The streamers were used to advertise the twitter that had a pastebin that detailed how other people could get in on this "exciting offer". I doubt he thought any of the actual streamers would get in on it, but either way, the money he donated wasn't real in the first place so what does it matter?
"...I need large sums of BTC (bitcoin) and my bank has a limit on transfers, and there's no way to purchase BTC with CC. So basically what I would ask you to do with any amount of the money that you have donated is to exchange it to BTC via  (trusted website) and then send the BTC to me, so you're basically doing an exchange for me. If you're not happy with this then it's fine, but if you're happy with this then we could probably create some form of partnership in regards to this. I would give you 33.33% of every exchange that I needed. So let's say you used x amount of money that I donated to you to exchange to BTC right now and send me the BTC, I would send you the money back + 33.33% of it. It is fully up to you. I need BTC because I want to invest into it..."

I actually recognize you from the r/hearthstone thread. They are going to tell you the same thing here. Tons of people already associate BTC with crime and this scam is small time compared to the myriad of other scams that surround BTC. It will have no effect at all and if BTC didn't exist he would have been asking people to buy him gift cards or something. 
Since BTC does exist, however, maybe he could use his stolen credit cards to buy BTC which he could use to buy gift cards from Gyft that other people bought with stolen credit cards and the circle of scam would be complete?

because its the "currency of the internet" that you can't even hold on anything connected to the internet without fearing being robbed. people who are reasonably tech savvy and knowledgeable about bitcoin enthusiasts also tout bitcoin as revolutionary for the "unbanked" and others being oppressed by the current system. but you expect people that don't even have bank accounts to have access to the internet and also an additional device that they can never connect to the internet? its just unwieldy and over-complicated.
