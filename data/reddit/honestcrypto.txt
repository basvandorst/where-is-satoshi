Putting assets in someone else's name is indeed a sketchy activity unless it is *actually* given to them. This is a common way to evade certain taxes (reduce your own taxable income by shifting assets to your wife and kids). 
What country are you in? That sounds silly because people open foreign bank accounts while living overseas all the time. You don't lose your bank account for large transfers, large transfers are simply reported. If it all looks plausible (like you have a job) there's nothing wrong with it. Just like when you're travelling across borders.
Now, if the country you're in has more stringent banking regulations, that's their prerogative and has nothing to do with North American AML protocols.

But if we're going by your definition (referring to the kernel code) then Bitcoin's **code**, not Bitcoin, would be dominant. Everyone would be spinning up their own fork with enough code on top of it for it to no longer be distinguishable as Bitcoin. 
Referring to Linux as the dominant operating system is silly. The Linux kernels are dominant, but the operating *systems* are many and varied. What we refer to actively as Linux tends to be desktop Linux, not the many products built on top of its kernel and some bits of code. It would be silly to say "I'm a Linux user" because their wireless router and smart fridge are running a Linux kernel. It would be odd to say the same about Android unless you're running one of those KDE or Ubuntu project builds.

I'm sorry but you're missing the point. I should point out that the focus of my Master's studies were precisely on economics. You can't incentivize your way past very hard limitations on electricity production. Many markets already heavily fund those areas but you can't simply create new and adequate bodies of water or will yourself longer days without overcast.

What's wrong with **you**? There are different kinds of investment vehicles. 
Cryptocurrencies are not like a GIC or other longer-term vehicle where you're locked out of using your funds for a period of time. Instead, they provide the potential returns of a stock brokerage account or mutual fund, only with the level of control and access of a savings account. 
This is why it is absolutely appropriate to facilitate the access and use of your funds. You always want faster access to your investments, especially when it doesn't sacrifice the rate at which it increases in value. 
Normally you have to sacrifice your returns in exchange for facilitated access. If someone could charge directly to their mutual fund holdings in the same day, it would be the hottest investment vehicle on the market.

This is trivial though, because it usually isn't difficult to export the transactions for tax purposes. Calculating capital gains and losses isn't tough and can easily be automated by these services, in addition to the crypto tax services.
The only real difference is the taxes for your fiat is taken before it hits your account (or at the end of the year without adequate remittance). With crypto, you'll only have the latter.

There's nothing wrong with the statement here. He's saying they're not interested in firms only interested in mining, but are interested in crypto-related startups who leverage the mining as part of an innovative business model.

You're conflating the colloquial use of Linux from a technical reference to its kernel. Think Windows, Mac, and Linux from a desktop perspective. When people use the term, that's what they're referring to. Suggesting "well, technically the Linux kernel is used for X, Y, Z" is simply pedantic. 
It's not the same kernel with extra stuff on top. Android uses their own kernel, which held the Linux kernel as a base. However, it is *not* the same kernel you'll find in the Linux repositories. There are architectural differences in the Android kernel and for years Google was criticized by the stable branch Linux kernel maintainer for not feeding into the Linux kernel. 
Google's own engineer once asserted to developers that "Android is not Linux". This is because the project is different enough that the Android kernel has little in common with the conventional Linux stack (which IS its desktop stack). Linus had commented on an expectation that Android and Linux kernels would eventually converge again (Android doesn't really take upstream Linux commits, my Pixel XL is still based on 2014's 3.18). 
Remember that there's Linux the kernel and Linux the operating systems. Android is an example of the prior albeit with what is essentially its own fork, but generally not considered part of the latter. The easiest way to tell the difference is by noticing Android and GNU Linux apps are generally not interoperable.
While I consider Android a Linux distribution, under no uncertain terms should it be mixed up with someone's colloquial reference to Linux. To suggest so demonstrates either a lack of understanding of language, or a lack of understanding of Android.

Frankly, your original post was unconstructive ad hominem that doesn't really support an argument. If you're talking about fentanyl, you can absolutely draw a linkage between a form of payment used in the dealing of illicit drugs and the harm of said illicit drug trade (note: that is not to say addiction itself should be a crime, but it's fairly obvious that many actors in that area shouldn't be encouraged given the current fentanyl crisis in parts of North America). 
What you suggest is a distraction rather than a rebuttal. Would a vehicle manufacturer, bar owner, and alcoholic all share **equal** responsibility for an accident involving a person hitting a bystander? Or is there room to criticize the bar owner for encouraging sales in spite of clearly intoxicated individuals without getting into a debate over whether or not the vehicle needs to share fault if we are to blame the bar owner for facilitating but not deciding?

Public debt isn't the same as private debt. Think of it more as a business investment. 
A business can borrow $5000 to spend on equipment, but if that can bring in an additional $5000 in revenue that year, followed by $2500 each year after that, then that can be a good thing. It would still be fine even if that loan costs $250 in interest per year. 
Government's also don't face the same interest rates as individuals. They enjoy the absolute best rates possible because they are typically the absolute lowest risk borrowers. So if you, as an individual, could spend $1000 today to earn $1000 more this year, and $400 every year for the next five years at only 3% interest annually - you would be nuts not to take on that debt.

Quebec doesn't have cheap electricity just because. It costs significant amounts to build out capacity to meet ever-increasing demand. They're currently planning for electrification of automotives - which already will require significant scaling up.
Quebec does well *because* it actively manages its network over the long term. It's also priced as a public utility to facilitate industry, not to facilitate electricity consumption.
If mining rigs only ran at off-peak hours, that wouldn't be a big deal. But 24/7 operations are costly. Mining facilities do not create anywhere near the same amount of jobs and revenue.

There's no such assumption being made. It is just based on the premise that a larger gross domestic product (econonomic activity) is desirable.
To calculate GDP:
GDP = consumption + investment + net exports + government spending
Now, how that spending occurs does matter. Building infrastructure would helps ensure you have more Infrastructure for next year, whereas spending to subsidize a business might only help that one year. 
Even when done absolutely poorly, it still bolsters GDP. The key point is that a gross national debt isn't an annual figure, whereas GDP is.

Absolutely. However, that's not an appropriate rebuttal because the existing cash system has had many measures introduced to make it more difficult to use for illicit purposes. It doesn't render it impossible, nor are the measures perfect, but it's significantly more difficult than not.  
Frankly, we should have real answers to the critiques that aren't attempts to dismiss the concern altogether. One of them being the fact that Bitcoin actually allows for unprecedented levels of traceability when used appropriately - without necessarily harming confidentiality. For instance, you may be able to track rough movements of Bitcoin and possibly blacklist them from a very real coded level (I don't really agree with this) - things that are more difficult with cash outside of banks. While tumblers will remain an obstacle, they'll obscure some information while allowing other key details to remain useful like general flows in/out of areas and services. 
It's the classic issue of striking a balance between privacy and ensuring depravity (e.g., child abusers) is not facilitated. There are ways. But we need to be open to discussing the issues rather than resort to ad hominem and strawman arguments... As natural as that may feel to us humans.

Keep in mind Gates operates from a harm reduction perspective these days, almost entirely consumed by population health concerns. From that perspective, anything that facilitates the atrocity of allowing fentanyl to wreak havoc is a concern. That includes a war on drugs, opposition to safe consumption sites, and parallel monetary systems that may be implicated.
Its not generic BS FUD, but a real downside. What is up for debate is whether or not it's an insurmountable concern and what should, or shouldn't, be done about it (say, whether focus should be on other areas of harm reduction to address the very criminality of addiction itself).
The two ways of thinking aren't inherently incompatible. They only appear to be if someone is unrelenting in their position on either ends of the spectrum.

BTC doesn't threaten developed countries' fiat. While some argue that cryptocurrencies like BTC will stabilize enough for it to become a dominant currency accepted for a widespread transacting, I remain skeptical. Fiat currency works well because they're legal tender, with a legal obligation to accept it as repayment for debt. 
You'd be much more likely to want to take out an auto loan or mortgage paid in fiat (predictable inflation, the amount you owe decreases in real dollars over time). 
Instead, cryptocurrencies have the potential to be a really interesting alternative to existing investment vehicles. Imagine holding AAPL stocks but being able to spend from that account on a daily basis without trusting a third party broker to hold it for you.

Believe what you want. I'd encourage you to read more into renewable energy and how electricity markets work. Particularly, the limitations of solar and wind electricity generation and how peaker electricity generation is needed to meet peak load demands at greater cost and often poorer efficiency. 
To meet *existing* electricity demand, significant investment is required and continuously planned. The thing with electricity production is that you work from the cheapest sources and move up - this applies to renewables more than most because you only have so many ideal locations. As you expand further, costs increase significantly. Higher electricity costs prices out miners quite easily. Its why you see resources being reallocated to regions with cheap electricity pricing today. But you can only do so much of that before you're out of viable options and cost needs to increase.
It's not black and white - but it is *way* more complicated than you think and unlikely to unfold how you'd otherwise assume. It isn't just a question of incentives. They're already there.

This will be an unpopular comment here, but he's not necessarily wrong. There are very real concerns of harm that can result from cryptocurrencies. This doesn't mean they're insurmountable, or unjustifiable - but it's an entirely fair position to believe they are. 
Cryptocurrencies aren't a universal good. Like anything, there are areas of concern that will need to be addressed through policy and community. We will see a whole lot of ingenuity appear to address the problems if we allow ourselves to be critical of the technologies, rather than fervently supportive no matter what - reason over ideology. 
When the community refuses to acknowledge areas where it isn't so great, or problems where it doesn't have answers, it diminishes our collective credibility on the matter. We end up looking like acolytes rather than reasoned advocates. 
A reasoned rebuttal goes much farther.
