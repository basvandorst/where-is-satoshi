You should've created a 6 digit passcode to even get into breadwallet.. they can't see your 12 words if they don't know your passcode

Ok well I opened breadwallet.. can you walk me through the process after I click "import private key"

I did not, but they were there..now I know. I sent them earlier from coinbase to my paper wallet because people say to take it off of coinbase..so i did that. My question is even tho I imported it to breadwallet, are they still on the paper wallet as well? Shouldn't my funds be showing on bread wallet (They aren't yet) ..I don't see anything yet on breadwallet, but when i keep clicking import my qr code.. it still is saying my balance on the paper wallet.. Very confused..thanks for your help btw

So I recently bought some bitcoin and sent it to a paper wallet .. I'm not sure if I should use bread wallet? Or just keep it on the paper wallet.. also how do I get my money off my wallet back onto coinbase app so I can see how much it grew?

Yea I'm just worried now cause the funds from the paper wallet aren't popping up after i imported... (maybe it takes awhile to show up) .. you sure I don't have to go into settings and click on "recover"..

Thanks..I'm an idiot, I was scanning the "load and verify" qr code not the "spend" one on the paper wallet..goes to show how much i know!

What are some other coins to look into, That you think will thrive? I'm thinking about investing in some companies behind the blockchain tech, just not sure if this is a solid move or to stay firm on bitcoin
