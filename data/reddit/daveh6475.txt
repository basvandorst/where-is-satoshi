I haven't done gbp to Coinbase before but from what you said it sounds like it's done it automatically. Yeah, it's annoying it takes so long. I have found its best to transfer money to Coinbase and hold it in there until it's worth buying.
Yeah, I've done it from Coinbase to Revolut to Nationwide and it works perfectly. Takes a few days from Coinbase to Revolut then a few more from revolut to nationwide. Probably a week in total.
I'm no expert but doing revolut/Coinbase etc seems to work for me!

No worries. It should go from your bank to Revolut instantly then a few days (maybe 4 or 5) to go from revolut to Coinbase. Remember to transfer from gbp to eur before transferring from revolut to Coinbase

I made a SEPA transfer from Nationwide to Revolut on 23 Dec (instant) then Revolut to Coinbase on the same date. Money arrived at Coinbase on 30th Dec. So although it did take longer to transfer than usual, yours should be in there already :(

Revolut! Transfer from Coinbase to Revolut then Revolut to Nationwide. I'm with Nationwide too and it works perfectly

I've got a UK Nationwide account and can confirm this works perfectly! Even better, transfer euros from Coinbase to Gdax and pay no fees ��

Perfect. I'll do that. Thank a lot :)

You need to go on the revolut app and click more&gt;profile&gt;account details&gt;euro then click activate right at the bottom. I had exactly the same problem. Hope this helps!

I tried revolut but I need to send a test payment to them. Revolut says the beneficiary is not allowed so I'm back at square one!

Yeah, literally after your comment. I had a quick Google and someone else said something similar. I'll leave it a couple of days and hopefully it'll resolve itself. Thanks for your help :)

Get Revolut and avoid this! I know it's too late now but it's a decent workaround
