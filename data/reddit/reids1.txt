You make it sound like dealing drugs and murder are legal...

What happens if there's a price move and they get rekt? I don't believe they don't buy/sell crypto as is otherwise their exposure would be too high.
@_date: 2019-11-08 15:40:14
Yeah, that's not proof.
@_date: 2019-06-10 13:07:31
Sounds legit.

You said people use BTC as a store of wealth - which means they'll constantly be comparing it to the price in fiat, I get that every BTC mined costs energy and work to produce, but the same is true of other mined cryptocurrencies - some of which have been made worthless over time - why is BTC immune to this?

Thank you, I know what BTC provides as I've been holding crypto since at least 2015, but that hasn't answered my question at all.

But surely BTC (much like your other example of gold) will always be paired with fiat therefore will always have a price that could effectively reach 0 much like fiat? Why can't BTC go to 0?

I trust it, I bought BTC at £30 (and Eth at £11), but like OP said it's true that there's still very little real-world use cases for BTC.

If BTC falls in price, then it will fall in value compared to all of the above. Which would surely mean it's not actually that great of a store of wealth considering there's not actually that many real-world use cases for BTC yet other than for speculating on?

Other than the fact that the bank confirmed it?

But it isn't a good store of wealth as it is highly volatile and too linked to fiat.  
So many other methods of payment are more convenient as a method of exchange.  
It can be confiscated.  
It can go to nothing.  
It isn't overly private.  
So what are the advantages over fiat?

upvote for a long-forgotten bash.org quote.

Definitely thought the article said "Officer Jenny" and I thought NO WAY.
