oh wow. That is some horrible luck.  I wish i would have bought some Casascius coins a few years ago. I hear they go for a lot these days.
I still have yet to hear back from her. 
I did try bitcoinian's tip and call her back. It rang twice and then went to voice mail. I also did call her pretty. lol
Oh well, I guess I can at least say I learned a valuable lesson. BTC&gt;(some)Women.

Well, I can try to get proof... But I do respect her enough to ask her about it before I go and post details.
*edit* thank you bitcoinian for the bitcoin tip. I appreciate it... Although I don't know if she would approve of it. I'm really not sure where she and I are at right now... I assume she's done with me, but I don't know

I agree youngkid7, I do not trust these kind of websites. I lost about $25 usd to one similar where you sent them your bitcoin and they were to send you paypal. I guess at first they sent people money, but then they just scammed everyone. When i approached cloudflare (the hosting provider for the one site I lost money on), they wouldn't take the site down until I sent them links to btctalk as well as a link to the transaction on blockchain.info.
I do not buy bitcoin on ebay though. Are btc (besides Casascius Coins) allowed on ebay still? I think Casascius Coins are allowed because they are a physical collectible item.

poolbath1, thank you for actually taking the time to respond and give some support. :)
I figure that there's a lot of fish in the sea, but only one bitcoin.
I'll admit, i am probably obsessed with BitCoin. But who doesn't get obsessed about things at times... 
She gets obsessed with clothing and I just stand around all day while she shops and support her. It's not like I'm wasting thousands of dollars on BitCoin either. I break even, and I'm happy about that.
Are there actually women out there who are in to BitCoin? Ladies, i do not mean this in a negative way, but I'm really just wondering.

We had been together for about 6 months. She knew that I was in to BitCoin, but at the time she didn't know what it was. So I started to explain it to her. In the last month she has wanted to be around me constantly. Unfortunately that interfered with my daily dose of coinage. So once in a while I had to tell her I was unable to hangout... I guess she got mad that I wouldn't spend evenings with her, and apparently since the SR bust I haven't answered the phone, or her texts... Which I did. (I mean, how is "Sorry baby DPR just got busted and BTCtalk is down, I can't talk now" not answering her?)
Anyway, I took off of work so I could make sure I knew what was happening in the BitCoin world. I didn't want to miss the moment BTCtalk came back either.
Fast Forward a bit. She called tonight, and asked me how my day was. Of course I discussed BitCoin with her... Or at least tried to. About 30 seconds in to the conversation she stopped me and said "Okay, shut up. I can't stand it anymore. Either It's me, or it's BitCoin. You need to make a choice right now." i had just hit refresh on reddit and noticed the PBS segment on bitcoin so of course I told her... and she just hung up the phone.

Didn't they try this with FailCoin... I mean FreiCoin already?

I've lurked on reddit for a few weeks now and I saw a few of the comments on blockchain.info . I did not really look in to the comments though.
Your reference is funny :)
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:15:55
lol, Thanks for the good advice. I think I'm gonna hang out on reddit a bit first though. Cool myself down, see what happens.
But I just think these few days are like living history. Maybe some day there will be a few lines in some high school Computer Science text book about the bust, and I want to say to kids some day "yeah, i was there. I did that".
@_date: 2013-10-06 05:18:08
lol, true
