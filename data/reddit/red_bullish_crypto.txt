I don't know what your goal is but Kucoin is an exchange. They don't have fiat though but you can trade if you already have coin.

Awesome job. I've always wanted something like this since I saw a small tv in a bathroom mirror in a hotel.

I've seen him a million times but thought the exact same thing on this photo

Like the other replies said there are 2048 words to choose from called "bip39". Every combo make a wallet, all but 60million are empty (according to other replies) but there are so many combos that there are more than atoms in the universe ( or some metric like that). So every person would have to have a ton of wallets to use them all if that's even possible. 
They aren't really known, more like can be guessed and with today's technology it would still take a long time to randomly find one if at all.
And with bitcoin, the public ledger is not private so that's how we know how many hold balances.

 2.4. All the words are already known
Every key is already known. Let me know how long it takes to find an active one, or just split the funds with me ;-)
I wouldn't do the "search for your wallet" option.
2.3. You can also make a 25th word for your seed. It's called a word but it can be a whole new string of words I believe, like another 24 words. I'm not too sure how it works though.
 
Edit. 
According to this video you can have your "24 word seed" with passphrase "a" and it would be a different account than the same "24 word seed" with passphrase "b"
Also, it's always good to split your funds into different wallets just in case.

I've been looking for something like this. Thanks!

It's the price when you bought it.

A huge crash producing a stat like this. It looks like the bundle came out Sept 2018 so they would have been aware that this unflattering stat would turn into this... just wait to roll it out the "stat" part a few months I would think. Granted it won't look good for a while but waiting 6-12 months just for that part would look better.  But at least they're honest!

I'm not sure when they started this feature but you'd think they would've waited knowing what was coming
