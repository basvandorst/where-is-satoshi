Hey! A friend and i came by and paid with bitcoin a year ago.   How's it going? Are you seeing any pick up in btc in aruba? 
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:27:37
No,  some of us see beyond the price rise, to see a win win situation.   The Greek can take their money out of the banks without having to cash it.   That's big.   More over they get in return a highly liquid commodity + secure payment system
@_date: 2015-12-18 05:36:24
More than anything bitcoin needs a vastly better user interface for fullnodes.  The interface should have a visualization of the block chain, a block explorer, and mining visualization.
@_date: 2015-06-18 23:18:45
The best line is the last one.   Greece could be the cradle of a new democratic empowerment via bitcoin

Carrying all your money around in cash is not safer than bitcoin.   You put your self at risk of being robbed.   The cost of security and paranoia is not worth it.  There is a reason balls exist.   Forget about being able to send money elsewhere in cash form.

So can we assume that since there is a built in Qr code reader and fingerprint scanner that it was primarily designed as a bitcoin compatible machine?
@_date: 2014-04-22 01:04:07
The one case where I can imagine another currency gaining ground from bitcoin really fast would also have to use sha256.  Only then would the cost to bitcoin miners be near zero.  Otherwise you would have to build a brand new mining/securing system.  That would take time and you would see it coming

Gold is property and it is also regulated by FinCEN to prevent money laundering.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:39:46
No you have to keep track of when you sold bitcoins or used them to buy something.  
Say you buy 10 bitcoins 1 year ago, used one to tip on reddit, and another to give as a gift, and another to buy a computer.  you have to calculate your gains from the price you bought and the day you sold, used it to buy something, or gave it away.    
the thing with cost basis is that it is "first in, first out" so any transactions you are doing now will create capital gains calculated from your earliest bitcoin purchase.

I think this was uniquely a great idea because they were able to convert many local businesses in St.Petersburg.  This is the right way to do it, parachute in and get a large number of businesses near each other to start accepting Bitcoin.    
  
I wonder if Bitpay is helping to close the loop by helping businesses pay their employees (and other vendors) in Bitcoin because they will most likely be the ones to use them elsewhere in St.Petersburg.

I believe this is a critical decision that will have to be made in the near future regarding Bitcoin.    The centralization in mining we are seeing now may or may not be the only pattern.  We may see more competition in the future and the pendulum would swing the other way.
  
In other words, there may be alternative fixes to the problem of centralized mining besides messing with the current incentive structure.    
  
For example, heaters with ASIC's as their heating element (esp. water heaters).  They would generate a lot of decentralized competition if there was one in each home/office.  I really do think there is a market for this.  
@_date: 2015-01-30 04:24:48
my office was robbed today.  fortunately, not much stolen.  in an inconspicous box lay my trezor among other trinkets.  the thief ruffled through it and thought nothing of it.  even if he had stolen the trezor, it is pin protected and has an exponential time interval between trials.
in short, consider all aspects of safety.  i think the trezor offers a lot of safeguards vs any percieved risks atm.  
@_date: 2015-01-28 16:13:54
Yea, waiting 5 min, and acting like that's a sign of something nefarious... makes me think you're the shady one
@_date: 2016-01-18 02:41:55
It's not two opposing perspectives, there are ways to have both.  There is not a 100% probability that there will be a significant drop or a proportional drop in decentralisation of hardware for every unit increase in the block size.  There very well maybe more nodes as the increasing block size allows more users to take part on the main chain.
@_date: 2016-01-17 23:13:06
I like to think of it like this. You're trying to ensure the decentralisation of the hardware. The big blockers are seeking the decentralisation of main chain access. Both are valid perspectives and need to be pursued. 
If you want more answers to the questions you're asking, especially regarding why other people feel the way they do, you should read  the Adaptive Block size proposal by Bitpay's CEO.  
@_date: 2016-01-15 03:49:45
The first quote is from bitcoinmarkets, not this forum.  Like you said, I've been around years.
I am not relying on others to form my opinion on censorship.  I have seen and experienced it first hand.  As well as seen its consequences in turning the community against itself. I have read theymos reasoning for his actions and they are flawed.  Specifically that xt is an altcoin.   It's BS 
"r/bitcoin is the  channel for news and discussion on bitcoin for most followers"  + censorship = theymos deciding its fate.  despite the streisand effect.  he is trying to sway the debate and succeeding.
@_date: 2016-01-23 00:09:55

@_date: 2017-01-27 17:41:07

@_date: 2015-08-28 23:31:21
y is it a dangerous experiment to fork?  if bitcoin cant be forked then i want nothing to do with it. this is essential to its decentralized nature.  
@_date: 2015-07-10 13:27:40
Actually Yes.  Price is decided at the margin and the sudden liquidation of ltc into btc could def cause a dramatic spike like this.    The fact that the price can't be sustained is further evidence

thank you for your effort.  i haven't been able to understand this either.  im no economist though, so i was hoping you guys wouldve had an answer... and if you didn't you'd start learning.  
I never understood how valuable the concept of  "the price is set at the margin" was until it affected me personally. 
an interesting perspective might come from my experience buying stocks denominated in btc.  i bought shares in a canadian bitcoin exchange at 0.44/btc.  As the price of btc went up in the recent rally, the price plummeted to 0.24 (it had an IPO of 0.3 btc).  even though the company is more succesful than ever.  its as if google stock started to fail because the dollar was doing better than it.   unless thats how it works, in which case mind blown
@_date: 2013-04-04 04:05:04
thats the one and only time i sold.  wish i hadnt
@_date: 2013-03-21 05:03:51
the feeling ur describing is essential to the concept of "deflationary spiral"
"A deflationary spiral occurs when the value of a currency, relative to the goods in an economy, increases continually as a result of hoarding. As the value of the currency relative to the goods in the economy increase, people have the incentive to hoard the currency, because by merely holding it, they hope to be able to purchase more goods for less money in the future. A lack of currency available in the market causes the price of goods to further decrease, resulting in more hoarding."

your absolutely right.. but the argument for wealth distribution never hinged on just the accusation that it was "unfair" because wealth was accumulated by luck
even if the wealth was hard earned (always depends on perspective), people we lay claim to it to address societal needs.  
and those needs will need to be met one way or another in the future.  even if its voluntary tax on our part.

i think ur on the money.  exchanges make money whether the market is going up or down. buying  this stock via havelock is interesting because it gives equity stake in the company.  10,000 shares in the IPO represents 10% of the company.  So if you buy 10 shares, u own 1/10,000 of the company.  
From bitcointalk forums, cavirtex customer support and professionalism is outstanding.  
One neg is that the fees are high.  nevertheless, seems to me that is something that will change if their business strategy demands.  if their higher fees put some off, maybe it will select for big name clients

is the confusion in that when u see a red arrow on bitcoinity or something you think thats a sell and a green arrow a buy?  
its actually the change in price from the previous order.  so if someone traded at a $1, and the next one at 0.90, the 0.90 would have a red arrow since it was a drop in price

longest chain wins, so if you include a transaction that other's don't, then it will have a different hash, won't be accepted, and the longest chain will move on, but that fork won't be able 2 move on unless it accepts the longest chain

best way to learn is to try.  
- go to blockchain.info and go to the import/export section.  u will see there that u can import a priv key.  notice that u do not need anything else 
- similarly, go to brainwallet.org and look at the transactions tab.  pasting a priv key there will give u the unspent outputs in raw form.  u can also see what a signed transaction looks like at the bottom

the change wallet thing scares me as well but from my trials i have not found it to be an issue since importing the priv key into most clients will handle the change wallets behind the scenes.  ive noticed that if i use one wallet for a few transactions, it tends to have more "inputs" with subsequent transactions
what id like to know is what clients that is an issue on.  i think brainwallet.org defaults to send the change back to the sending address.  i tested it offline to generate a transaction with a partial amount and pushed it using blockchain.  the change came back to the sending address
to ur question, the method u described would work 
@_date: 2013-04-07 21:37:35

lets just assume those bitcoins u invested are a sunk cost. its as if u had sold them at the time u purchased the shares.  for me that was around .44/btc --&gt; $44 us dollars at that time.
with that sunk cost however, we gained equity share in a company that is raking it in.  
$500,000 profit was expected with no growth, id say it will be closer to $5mil.
i imagine any dividend they give out overtime will be more than $44/share that i put in.  and if they get bought out... hells yes

each block has a header that is fed into the next block's hash.  that is how they are linked.  if the bitcoin client u are using wanted, they could put the header of the most recent block into their software code the day they release it.  then whoever uses that client would only have to download the blockchain from that embedded block and forward. (instead of from the genesis block).

ive been pondering the same.  ive decided to go with armory client which uses a computer that never connects to the network.  u create a transaction on the offline computer and then using a usb key, transfer the pending transaction to a connected computer to broadcast it

@_date: 2013-04-28 20:50:36
lets assume liquidity is not an issue and exchanges are frictionless, than a bitcoin in america is worth the same as a bitcoin in china.  
by segmenting bitcoin you are suggesting they create alternative cryptocurrency systems. however, this doesn't seem to address the issue of what to do when a local currency implodes. when that happens, i assume people have to use a currency that has value not based on their local economy.  a chinesebitcoin would offer no benefit if it only exchanges with the yuan.

@_date: 2013-03-30 13:05:47
im with you as well 
but i think the banking system as it is causes huge inequalities.  $40 over draft fee?  seriously just dont process the payment.  why kick a man when he is down?  
long term debt is i think the biggest driver of wealth inequality, bitcoin encourages people to save because the value increases (and not like the paltry savings account amount)
also, poor people can spot a good idea as well, but they dont have the capital to get equity in it.. even places like crowdfunder require actual investors to have a lot of money

just to confirm, so TAT.asicminer fractional shares on havelock are now pretty valuable, more than any other PT shares, because of the following copied and pasted from "share overview" on havelock.  in essence, those fractional shares now have fractional board member status.
"Additional Dividends or Benefits from Board Member Status
Once the passthrough reaches 5,000 whole ASICMINER shares (500,000 split shares) it may receive a board member seat. If board member status is confirmed, and Friedcat follows through with the plan to give each board member a trial ASICMINER mining board, any income generated will be shares as follows:
85% of the mining income from any hardware given to this board seat will be paid out to the shareholders of ASICM on the same weekly dividend schedule ASICMINER currently uses. At the discretion of the TAT.ASICMINER issuer, these extra dividends may be distributed sooner."
