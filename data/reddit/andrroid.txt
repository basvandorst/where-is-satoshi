Let me rephrase. Do you think people that take bitcoin seriously are smarter/more intelligent people?
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:46:39


Have you adopted bitcoin? If you have, does this then make you a smart person?
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:11:07
Sure no problem.
I would define seriously as a real currency, beyond just a bad investment many redditors have made whilst clinging to the hope that bitcoin will some day become relevant.

But surely the people at who support bitcoin encompass the smart people who have adopted bitcoin?

Would you agree that your dismissal to 'do your own research' is a tactic to avoid discussing the inevitable failure of bitcoin?

Might want to look up what "infer" means.
@_date: 2014-12-16 18:21:22
I feel like you are avoiding my original question.
@_date: 2014-12-16 17:53:48
Do you believe that is an objective or subjective observation?
@_date: 2014-12-16 23:21:40
Sorry, I am new to bitcoin. Why am I an idiot for asking that question?

How valuable is your time in terms of bitcoins?
Would you agree this number would be irrelevant due to the irrelevant value of bitcoins?

Have you adopted bitcoin? If you have, does this mean you are one of the smarter people in the room?
