Most people on this subreddit have Bitcoin. I posted this when bitcoin was 458. bitcoin has since dropped to 302. They could have made over 50% more Bitcoin by listening to me. I only did this for the ones who would listen. I couldn't give less of a shit about your feed back because all in all, I made 60% more Bitcoin while listening to myself and the charts. I repeat I tried to help people gain more Bitcoin as I did. So if you don't want more Bitcoin than don't click on my posts in this subreddit. There are too many damn niave people in this subreddit, don't be one of them.

Looks alot more stable than last time it reached the $1,000 mark.. There's significantly less volume than last time which means less dumping and less of a chance of going down.

I'm saying when more big companies start adopting and big companies like Zinga don't care what the price is per bitcoin. If the price per Bitcoin goes down, they'll just c hare more bitcoin.

Money wise. All dogecoins together are about $25m. All Bitcoins together are about $25B.

Doesn't make any sense. Saw an opportunity to help Bitcoin owners. What is this subreddit for? Saying not to sell bitcoin? If a post says sell, that post gets shit on. Where else could this post have been? Not financials or stocks or currency becuase this is THE Bitcoin subreddit.

well it will probably go back near a thousand in a month or so again. I was just thinking short term gain for long term profit. :/

I was just studying the charts as well as the volume comparing to the price and must say, it took alot less volume to push it down to 450 than last time. So Im just sayin. There was also no big bump up on the way down, which also shows signs of falling. Personally I sold at 508 and am waiting to buy it back in 300's.

Yeah. What gives me the right to state what I believe is going to happen. Fuck me right? I made a post stating that Bitcoin is going under 900 a couple weeks ago. I even gave my reasons for my prediction. Got so much hate. But I was lucky enouph to listen to myself and sell half my equity of bitcoin above 900 before it fell. Hey I might be wrong, but don't be that guy.

Everyone, I simply made this post for Bitcoin owners benefit... I said bitcoin was going lower  when Bitcoin was at 458. Bitcoin went as low as 300 as I called. I sold my Bitcoin just a moment before I made this post as I wish you had too. I was wise enough to listen to the chart and my experience. which gained me 60% ore Bitcoin at 323. Not going to give anymore advice in this forum because 66.6% dont listen, but the 33.3% who gave me upvotes are the wise ones. So... yeah, your loss. I don't give a fuck if this gets a fuck ton of down votes, I'm happy as shit right now bitches.
