CRYPTOCURRENCIES ARE NOT ONLY BITCOIN AND ETHEREUM. It is also other great projects, on which I would like people to pay more attention, for example CREDITS, EOS, NEO. Bitcoin and Ethereum may be the biggest coins now, but there are hundreds of coins which can achieve similar or even better rates of return. Each coin has a specific purpose or solves a particular issue. For example CREDITS solve the problem of speed transactions as their speed is about 1mln tps. However, a word of caution: Make sure sufficient due diligence is undertaken before investing. Cryptos can be highly volatile and they are at the stage of infancy; there’s a possibility that many coins may fail or are downright scams. The crypto world is extremely intimidating, due to the complexities in understanding the technology. The use of technical computing terms can confuse and deter outsiders. This is the main reason why many stay away from Cryptos.

I truly believe in Credits cuz they hav a low network capacity, more than 1 mln transactions per second, low price and advanced smart contracts.

There are so many good sides of blockchain! For example new blockchain platform CREDITS in their news feed claim that - Blockchain is the key to the Internet of Things in medicine! Also CREDITS is a great project I think because they have very cheap operation cost, the average operation time is approximately 3 sec and they have 1mln transactions/sec

Thats a great news I think, now other crypto is also gonna rise up! I owe EOS and CREDITS, looking forward for their pump up this year.

Imagine having the opportunity to be part of the internet revolution in the 1990s. It was a perfect opportunity for you to acquire a vast amount of wealth and more importantly, bragging rights. The rights exclusive only to the initial investors and backers of the revolutionary technology, and that which could serve as your lifetime legacy. That recognition goes beyond material wealth and it really is currently at your fingertips. How many can claim the rights of being the few that took part in the development of a revolutionary part of human evolution? Very few. Cryptocurrencies are the gateway to that legacy.Such crypto as NEO, EOS, CREDITS, BTC etc...
The cryptocurrency market has been growing at an exponential pace and making a number of people very rich. But is it all about making money? The technology underlying cryptocurrencies – called Blockchain technology – has the potential to change our lives for the better.

If his rocket crashes into an alien spacecraft, then the aliens declare war on land and plasma nuclear weapons. Then yes, this is a good comparison. Crypto will not fall, it was just proved this week by rising up of btc, eos, cs and other coins!

Since the very beginning of Bitcoin, the true identity or identities behind "Satoshi Nakamoto" has remained a mystery.... But anyway he made a great opportunity for society to earn money! There are so many good coins now due to him, for example eos, credits, neo etc.
