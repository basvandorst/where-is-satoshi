You're right. I have it disabled. I remember when I was setting up my bank account, the banker insisted to enable it because it's good for me. I insisted to disable it because I know what I want, plus I can enable it anytime If I have to, which I will never do.

Please consider the [Hey Duwamish River Project](
While this website is focused only on the Duwamish river in Seattle, the team is building a platform that can be forked and used to monitor pollution in every river around the world. The team also collaborates with teams monitoring a river in Portland and another in Iraq. 
Please help them expand, scale, and even hire researchers to allow the platform to grow.
I have a vision for this platform and believe it can grow to monitor pollution of every river around the world. Think of North Dakota, think of rivers where people can swim, fish, and do all different activities. This platform helps people report and track any violations that may occur on or near rivers.

Shit! I am a guy that knows about bitcoin and blockchain more than the average guy, yet I always associated bitcoin.com with bitcoin. Only today I learned that .org is the real one

Where is yours?

You're right. Visa could pretty much add something like bitcoin in the future, when bitcoin is finally main stream and used by everyone and accepted everywhere. You never know.

The myth.. The legend...

They could have said "biggest currency, and has no central bank"

What about the myth of that guy who had 500 bitcoins  but lost access to his wallet?

This guy has balls. YouTube suggests other videos of him, one in which he was escorted out of the parliament.

That's the issue. Most people are treating it as stock while the end goal is for bitcoin to be used as a currency in our daily lives.
