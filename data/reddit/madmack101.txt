The chain is over 185gb to date. Probably initial sync uses lots of data

Wiki 
Originally, 50 bitcoins were earned as a reward for mining a block. Then it dropped 25 bitcoins, and then to 12.5 bitcoins. In 2020, it'll drop to 6.25 bitcoins. So if we do the math, if there is a halving event every four years, the last Bitcoin should be mined sometime in the year 2140

Thats why people mine alt coins and sell for btc, its more profitable. I still mine at a loss because i believe it will go up in time.
