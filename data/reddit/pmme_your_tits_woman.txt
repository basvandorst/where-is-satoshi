I wonder whether it's at all a societal thing to assume we can't do anything and give up immediately like that.
Like I was commenting once on an article that was unclear and people were like "why didn't he address this thing he brought up" and I said "yeah too bad he won't read the comments" and then a while later I was like "oh yeah I can probably email the guy".
(there's the whole "what does it matter if I vote my guy won't be winning" thing too, and how it's easier to put a law into effect than repeal it, net neutrality being fought against with money and bought politicians, etc.)

Somehow I read that as 86 Bitcoin, and I was like "WHAT!?"

Should this be cross posted to or something? (I already did it but I wonder if it's applicable or if I should delete it)

omg I didn't even notice the difference because I purposely reworded the OP to that in my head immediately.
I re-read your comment two times, but didn't see it until i read the 3rd reply that quoted you

You can edit your comment, and even add ~~ (without space between) around the incorrect word to make a strikethrough ~~ like this ~~ ~~like this~~

I'm trying to picture the facial expression.

I pictured something more like a wince or frown.
