Καλά ναι.... Ας πούμε 300 ή πάλι πολλοί είναι ;

Very rough estimate. From all the people that i know. I am the only one involved.

Only a small percent of Greek people have heard of Bitcoin and that's cause of a tweet from Yanis Varoufakis minister of economics as an Aprils fools day “Greece Will Adopt the Bitcoin If Eurogroup Doesn’t Give Us a Deal”
Of those who know about it, only a few have invested in it.
My estimate is that only 500 people in Greece own at least some Bitcoin.

The real value of bitcoin and crypto currency technology

I believe the issue will be for Greek funds only.

Greek here. Paypal works only if you already have balance in your account. If you try to use extra funds from credit cards or bank account you can't use it.

No. Greek people are unaware of Bitcoin. My estimate is that only 1 in every 20.000 will have some in possession .

Yes i believe so. But i can't check it out since i don't have any.

There are not many places to spend bitcoins here in Greece.
Just software companies and 2-3 restaurants. I doubt if they had more than 10 customers that payed in Bitcoin.
Personally I am involved for 1.5 years and I've also created a website that interacts with Bitcoin.

Yes. You can store money on your paypal account. Capital control can't control that.

At this moment it's better to hold than liquefy.  If you sell 1 bitcoin now it's 240 euros. So you have to go to the atm more than 3 times while capital controls are in effect.
