it's actually the best time, they're usually in some state of movement when you wake up. the other option is to spend the whole day looking at your phone and seeing no updates :D

if you aren't sure about bitcoin, you could trade it for another crypto that you see a better future with, it's a risky time to get rid of everything though since it's still a very early stage. Crypto is coming, the one that seems to have a head start is definitely bitcoin, and all the others seem to depend on the price of bitcoin as well.
if you don't feel like any of this is worth it, cash out now and enjoy whatever amount of money you made and don't look back

find someone with enough bitcoin and who's willing to let you do this
edit : also keep in mind those that tried to do it when it was at 5k
