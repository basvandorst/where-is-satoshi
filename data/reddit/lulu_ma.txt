dick vs bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-11 05:33:24
just ignore price fluctuation, buy your bitcoins and save them in YOUR wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-15 10:31:50
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:49:30
hodling BTC for long term. not necessary to worry about ROI.
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:54:57
He is so handsome.
@_date: 2019-07-12 09:38:51
I think he already sold his bitcoin and now waiting for buy back.
@_date: 2019-07-18 15:17:25
BTC above 10000 USD now. just hodl, don't day trade, it is for your own good.
@_date: 2019-07-15 12:33:12
be patient, my friend. BTC will moon soon enough.
@_date: 2019-07-06 00:59:12
glad to hear that. send him to prison please.
@_date: 2019-07-09 05:54:10
12k USD is not much. just hodl your BTC.
@_date: 2019-07-11 03:47:33
keep buying BTC and hodl them to death

short term trading is zero sum game. there are always 50% win and lose rate. like gambling.
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:00:39
all altcoins and stable coins will die out. only bitcoin can survive.
@_date: 2019-07-11 15:46:11
any wallets to which you have full control of your private keys. 
i mean do not put your bitcoins in any exchanges.  not your key, not your coins.
@_date: 2019-07-05 09:43:51
for marketing?
Steven Easterbrook must buy many bitcoins recently.
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:52:58
think carefully, you wouldn't use gold to buy fast food either.
@_date: 2019-07-19 18:59:36
BSV is scammer coin even worse than bcash
@_date: 2019-07-07 11:27:00
I bought mine at 16K USD and still don't think BTC as scam.
Who cares about the price?
@_date: 2019-07-31 22:59:16
right, some alts are good technologically. such as Ethereum and Monero. they have been good in past few years and already received credits from public. however, they are not original enough to challenge the real bitcoin (BTC). at least, they are much better than those ridiculous bitcoin forks.
@_date: 2019-11-21 18:09:27
This kid knows bitcoin better than most government officers.
@_date: 2019-11-24 18:18:48
China can ban all exchanges, bank transfers and mining easily. It is still possible to use or transact cryptocurrency but it will become very inconvenient.
@_date: 2019-08-28 16:21:43
**Satoshi Nakamoto** should win the Nobel Prize economics.
@_date: 2019-08-21 19:52:10
@_date: 2019-08-27 19:21:45
real satoshi creates BTC; fake satoshi creates BSV.
@_date: 2019-10-16 07:19:15
We are all Satoshi except for Craig S. Wright.
@_date: 2019-08-03 06:22:18
fiat system is flaw and it will die by itself. no need to be got replaced.
@_date: 2019-08-22 21:31:16
indeed, day trading altcoins makes you lose. just hodl your BTC in the trusted wallet (not the exchange one).
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:11:23
bitcoin is not bubble. it cannot be printed as debt.
@_date: 2019-08-20 19:23:51
neither.  Satoshi Nakamoto is Japanese.
@_date: 2019-08-10 09:27:55
no one even bothered to attack bitcoin forks. not worth the time and money.
@_date: 2019-08-06 01:36:06
this story tells us. never trust fiat system. it is a global scam.
@_date: 2019-08-26 15:52:11
end of China, the next will be USA.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:02:10
poor bcash. lol
@_date: 2019-08-05 06:26:12
obviously price manipulation from exchanges in order to win in their derivative markets.
fuck those scammers.
@_date: 2019-10-29 06:45:32
The term "bankrupt" is not for bank. When central banks run out of money, they can simply print more.
@_date: 2019-10-05 14:52:20
just dump and let us buy them cheap.
@_date: 2019-08-06 02:05:44
who cares about chinese yuan?
@_date: 2019-08-30 02:09:23
congrats! next millionaire born.
@_date: 2019-08-31 22:58:05
always use coindeck to buy bitcoin (BTC)
@_date: 2019-10-06 21:39:19
because Hong Kong dollars and Indian Rupee are devaluing.
@_date: 2019-10-12 04:14:28
Hong Kong is not that friendly to bitcoin. Some Hong Kong companies (e.g. Gatecoin) were banned in last year. Their government and political parties (either side with CCP or not) keep calling cryptocurrency and crytomining are scams.
@_date: 2019-08-30 17:57:46
wise choice. :D
@_date: 2019-10-19 07:23:33
@_date: 2019-08-03 04:18:57
maybe you can if you are capable or lucky. but how about the innocents? do they deserve this?
@_date: 2019-10-28 03:21:30
Lucky you.
@_date: 2019-10-21 02:44:50
If Craig Wright is Satoshi Nakamoto, I will eat my own dick. lol
@_date: 2019-10-31 15:40:45
Russian never disappoint us. Thumb up !
@_date: 2019-10-01 13:42:06
some Japanese corporations already paid bitcoins as salaries several years ago.
@_date: 2019-10-20 23:44:47
Russian are the best! Thumb up!
@_date: 2019-10-22 03:05:10
Do you realize that it is not hard to use USD to buy gun and child porn?
@_date: 2019-10-09 06:43:48
To be honest, who cares about Hong Kong's internet and banks?
@_date: 2019-10-23 01:19:14
Do not use any exchanges. They are the biggest scammers.
@_date: 2019-10-02 13:40:33
True, China would like to control everything. They already banned many cryptocurrency exchanges. Sadly, Chinese miners also control majority of bitcoin hashrate. Great diasater if their government bans mining on some days.
@_date: 2019-10-22 08:55:12
We should also prohibit all use for WeChat and Alipay.
@_date: 2019-10-09 00:56:12
That is market manipulation. After they kill the no coiners, they will try to kill bitcoin hodlers later.
@_date: 2019-06-28 05:35:09
bitcoin hit 20000USD at December.
@_date: 2019-10-23 08:54:23
And then, the Grandma shows the boy a paper wallet with name label "Satoshi Nakamoto". lol
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:53:58
Just bankrupt and hodl your bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:30:38
Smart move indeed. North korea and Iran will rule the world after several 10 years.
@_date: 2019-06-28 02:05:40
I bought mine at $11500. still want to get more.
@_date: 2019-04-24 13:03:30
not just a bull, BTC is a beast.
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:46:17
the trend : alt coins are getting more popular.
sad to hear that people are so enamored with new and bored with the old.

@_date: 2019-04-20 11:02:56
some people told me bitcoin cash (BCH) is real world transaction cryptocurrency than bitcoin (BTC). 
i asked them how could i actually buy something with BCH, no one can answer. lol
@_date: 2019-04-25 08:58:12
for example : Wu Jihan and Craig Wright
they create their own fork coins, claim them as real bitcoins and want true bitcoin (BTC) die.
@_date: 2019-04-25 18:55:52
At very least, BTC is reserve currency in cryptoworld right now.
@_date: 2019-09-07 17:11:19
Lesson learnt and punishment received.
@_date: 2019-09-22 09:50:46
congrats! welcome to billionaire club.
@_date: 2019-09-06 03:37:00
very expensive in game items.
do you realize the potential value of one sat?
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:03:15
no coins, no life
@_date: 2019-09-29 18:39:44
i think quantum computers have greater impacts on SHA256 mining rather than cracking private bitcoin keys.
@_date: 2019-09-23 22:13:17
fiat sucks indeed. especially USD and RMB. they are fully manipulated. that is the reason why we need crypto currency.
@_date: 2019-09-16 03:30:40
Libra is a centralized altcoin.
@_date: 2019-09-10 21:48:49
i have another suggestion.
make your debt to buy all your bitcoins (BTC) and bankrupt. enjoy your coins. lol
@_date: 2019-09-03 23:29:38
Theoretically yes, people can trace your ID through dishonest ISP or VPN provider.
Just frequently switch different wallet addresses to reduce the chance of censorship.
Personally, i do not afraid of censorship, because BITCOIN is a HUMAN RIGHT. 
Not even Donald Trump and Xi Jinping can ban it.
@_date: 2019-09-29 21:31:56
higher the fee, higher the price. yummy for hodlers like us.
@_date: 2019-09-16 03:33:39
thanks to infinite inflation (easy printing of cash), fiat system is already broken.
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:49:38
one is not enough. two is even better. to play safe, we recommend three.
@_date: 2019-09-13 03:44:03
remember to copyright your materials, otherwise some people like CSW may steal your efforts.
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:17:57
Google dumped the bitcoins mined by their quantum computers. lol
@_date: 2019-09-06 05:26:46
i'm quite surprising to hear good points from Hamilton in such a bitcoin promotion video. really awesome.

some alts are not that bad. for example XMR.
@_date: 2019-09-04 01:55:15
as a lady, she is pretty cute. :D
@_date: 2019-09-25 06:01:22
@_date: 2019-09-19 04:50:43
Fiat is a SCAM.
@_date: 2019-09-22 04:06:23
paper wallet is good enough.
@_date: 2019-09-04 20:42:44
this doesn't prove BTC is insecure. it is still 100 times easier for street robbers to take your cash and run rather than forcing you to enter the passphrase and transfer.
@_date: 2019-09-26 03:38:07
just bought BTC at average cost. no success on catching the dips before. :(
@_date: 2019-09-02 00:26:35
me waiting for bitcoin price doubling. :D
@_date: 2019-05-25 00:45:50
I will hodl all my BTC no matter what. If you want cash that much, sell yours, don't bother me.
@_date: 2019-05-17 13:43:57
I bought mine at 7300 USD. :D

**Craig Wright Is Not Satoshi Nakamoto** 
It is a consensus. Proof is not needed.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:09:24
Even US Copycat office doesn't know who is Craig Wright.
@_date: 2019-05-22 11:30:36
BSV must be delisted from any exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-23 12:56:29
At least, they let you to withdraw your funds. Some even more scammy exchanges could close your account and confiscate your coins. As a golden rule, never trust any exchanges.
@_date: 2019-05-16 12:45:57
Agreed. Never invest any altcoins (non BTC).
@_date: 2019-05-22 18:43:02
It is how real Satoshi looks like. Not meant to be racist, I think Satoshi Nakamoto is a Japanese. :D
@_date: 2019-05-21 17:23:45
We can write a letter to US embassy to challenge the validation of patent.
Request all major exchanges to delist BSV.
If we choose to be silent, CSW will push his luck further.
