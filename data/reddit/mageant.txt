Just buy and hold. Only invest a small portion of your savings or whatever you can afford to lose. 
If you only have a small amount of savings anyway (i.e. it's not going to be enough to retire with) then you might as well invest more.

As a merchant you still might prefer to accept only certain Lightning currencies. For example, you might only want to have Lightning Bitcoins even though Lightning Litecoins would also be available. For users it would be good to know this to avoid paying possible conversion fees.

Good question. I don't think anybody knows the answer to that. Maybe both markets will affect each other.
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:27:14
Through arbitrage. Let's say at the CME market prices Bitcoin much lower than on the exchanges, e.g. at only $8000. Then a CME market participant can arbitrage by opening a long position there and at the same time short-sell the same amount of Bitcoin on some exchange (Bitfinex for example). No matter what the price does until the future matures the participant makes the difference ($2000) from the current price ($10,000) minus fees. The immediate net result is downwards pressure on Bitcoin also on the exchanges.
This can work the other way around though too, though.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:55:33
They have already been trying to do that. Why do you think there are already 200 obituaries on Bitcoin written by the mainstream media?
@_date: 2017-12-01 14:20:33
Through arbitrage. Some market participants who take a side of a bet will arbitrage/hedge by buying or short-selling actual bitcoins.

Arbitrage. If the price on the CME market differs significantly from the one on the exchanges people will arbitrage the difference by buying or short-selling actual bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-04 22:16:29
They might try that, but I think it's unlikely and it's getting increasingly unlikely as time passes. The reason being, the more widespread and popular Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies become the more resistant the population would be against an outright ban. Their strategy is currently seems to me to be more on the level of mind or perception of these things. The institutions are trying to get people to distrust and not want cryptocurrencies.

In that case, it also means that it's currently undervalued.

Segwit does *not* reduce bandwidth. So if you have 2 MB blocks with Segwit you are still sending 8 MB of data per block over the network.
@_date: 2015-06-01 12:17:44
1MB blocks in 2010 when the limit was imposed are the equivalent of 7MB blocks today and 11MB blocks in 2016
(considering improvements in bandwidth and computers), so we are effectively only tripling or doubling computer resources usage with 20MB blocks.

I think the 10% rule was a very smart decision, since it was such a small percentage.

Because of the network effect, the most useful "settlement blockchain" is the most widely used one, which is currently Bitcoin by far.
Sure, banks could create their own blockchain, which would be relatively easy, but getting enough other banks and organisations to start using the same one is the difficulty.

This video clears up quite a few misconceptions about Bitcoin in China that I read about in the community.
1.) Bitcoin is not competitive for merchant payments in China. Existing digital payment systems in China are already very widespread and cheap.
2.) Hong Kong is not a "regulatory free zone" for Bitcoin versus China, and actually may be stricter than in China itself.
3.) Bitcoin is not necessary for Chinese people to get around foreign currency controls. They already have plenty of other options.
Practically the only interests in Bitcoin for Chinese people seem to be investing and mining. The advantage in mining is not lower electricty costs, but other general costs (housing, wages, etc.).

Wall Street would never be able to buy up a large portion of the Bitcoins without skyrocketing the price.

If the amount in 1MyGwFAJjVtB5rGJa32M6Yh46cGirUta1K did not move between 2011-11-16 and 2014-03-07 when did the thieves steal the coins? MtGox claims somebody stole the coins.
Either the coins were already stolen in 2011 then MtGox should have reported something already then, but they did not. 
Otherwise if they were stolen on 2014-03-07 then their report that they only had 2000 BTC left when they declared bankruptcy is false. And how could the thieves steal the coins when the website was already shut down?
@_date: 2014-03-07 02:03:48

It's the bitcoins from the Silk Road user's wallets, not the coins from Ross Ulbricht.
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:08:54
Also note that works the other way around too. 
If too few people save and spend the money or invest it then the economy grows fast thus increasing the demand for Bitcoin and thus making its value go up.
This then creates the incentive to save instead of spending.
So whatever people do too much (either saving or spending) the result is that it creates the incentive to do the opposite. So basically it's a self-balancing system.

@_date: 2014-03-14 10:15:21
I would vote for 1 XBU = 1 uBTC.

It is not fractional reserve banking per se, its the combination of fractional reserve banking and monopolized money.
Monopolized money alone would be - more or less - ok if it was asset-based, like backed with god.
Fractional reserve banking is also ok - more or less - if it's just some bank/organization doing it with some privately issued currency. Then it would be up the users of that currency if they want to use that or not. If that bank gets into trouble or starts manipulating then the damage is limited and people can switch to some alternative.

If Bitcoin becomes an significant part of the economy the need for extreme decentralization will be less IMHO. In such a situation the government cannot attack Bitcoin anymore without harming the economy.

It's a self-regulating cycle. 
If a business that can outperform the general growth level then it will receive investments. So only the most efficient ones are supported.
If too few people invest in new businesses then the economy does not grow and thus there is no increased demand for Bitcoin which means the value of Bitcoin does not increase. 
This then creates a disincentive to save so that people start investing instead again.
It's a more natural form of growth based on supply and demand, in contrast to the current top-down directed growth where either cheap credit is flooded into the market or credit is made prohibitively expensive.

You could equally argue that giving the government total surveillance power would be effective at stopping crimes.
The problem with giving government so much power though, is that the power of misuse also increases.
Therefore the government's activity should be restricted to what is morally correct. The government should not be allowed to anything an individual would not be allowed to do.

I agree. The widespread idea though is that Germany is supposed to be a good example of a country, especially when compared to developing countries, when in fact it is not much better than anywhere else (with regards to corruption at high levels).
It's just that the corruption is hidden better with more complex lies, so it's harder for people to figure out. 
Some examples of this are the recent scandals: NSA spying, Deutsche Bank, bank bailouts, revelations of the Octoberfest attack, the uncovering of many cartels, and the control of the mass media.

@_date: 2015-05-09 00:47:41
The way I see it is, increasing the block size limit 20 MB is better than doing nothing.
The main problem with that though is that the Bitcoin community will be having the same discussion in about five to ten years from now.
The best solution would be something algorithmic, so that we can avoid more hard forks from now on.
@_date: 2015-05-08 23:26:03
I agree this is way better, if it can be implemented.
Something like double the max. size if the last X blocks have been 50% full. Then target a blockchain height at which the change will occur, to give time for software changes.
@_date: 2014-03-07 16:24:47
I guess the idea is if the Bitcoin were stolen by an external thief then he would have moved them away before or just after February 25th when the website was shut down.
Because the thief could not have known who else might have the private key to those addresses and it would not make sense for him to wait any longer than necessary to steal the coins.
@_date: 2017-02-20 21:06:07
What if China outlaws Localbitcoins like in Germany? Would you then also remove the China page like you did for Germany?

It will be very easy to split the chain by just by sending out a certain transaction, namely by spending one of the "any can spend"-addresses that would be interpreted otherwise with SegWit. Unless miners write code to explicitly exclude such transactions that would force a split in a similar way to a hardfork. If there is only a minority of hashing power behind them the SegWit nodes (no matter how many they are) would be on the minority chain and not "Bitcoin" anymore.

Even so SegWit has even more advantages like being able to use different types of signatures. This may become very important once we need to start using Lamport signatures against quantum computers.

It seems BCH has a bit of a flaw that miners could exploit. After the difficulty adjusts upwards at the end of a period, they could just withdraw mining power so that the difficulty emergency adjusts downwards again. Then pump in mining power again to mine a block every minute and cash in. After the next difficulty adjustment repeat all over again.

You could also rephrase it as: "You should only invest money you will not need in the near future." The longest bear market in Bitcoin has been 3 years, so if you don't need the money in the next 5 years or so, you should be ok.
What also helps me from not being afraid of price drops is that I am mainly invested in crypto for *ideological* reasons. If the economy started using crypto on a large scale this would benefit all of humanity and the Earth (not just crypto holders). Becoming rich is just a nice side-effect for me.

I actually consider Bitcoin safer in the long term. Stocks and bonds are susceptible to government shenanigans, Bitcoin is not unless they shut down the entire Internet (in which case we have totally different problems).

Increasing the block size to 2 MB would only temporarily solve the problem. It would be ok if there was consensus for it, but there's not.
It's better to get people to start using 2nd layer solutions early while the whole network is still growing. The longer we wait with implementing 2nd layer solutions the greater the resistance will be against that (because the more software has to be changed).

You can also hedge by keeping some of your BCH. If you keep your BCH and it goes to 0, then that's good for Bitcoin and you only lost 10% (a price swing which Bitcoin can do in a week). On the other hand if the hard fork to 2MB does not happen or is contentious, then people might turn to BCH and the price might rise significantly above the current one.

I think one of the additional factors to determine where we are in the cycle now is time. It takes time for the hype from last year to die down. I expect that we will reach that point in the second half of this year. This would be similar to what happened in two of the previous "bubbles" (2011 &amp; late 2013). After that I would expect a gradual rise and then new highs in another year or two.
@_date: 2017-08-05 20:43:41
Even if the mining difficulty dropped by a factor of 100 (meaning energy is 100x more expensive than now) it would still be very impractical to attack Bitcoin. Even in such a case, the software could be rewritten to counter the attack.

Another thing to remember is that in the long run the block reward goes to zero, meaning that miners will only make money from transaction fees eventually.

Yes it has all the signs of a bubble. That is not necessarily a bad thing though. It just means it will top out at some high price and then drop down to reasonable levels again. The thing is, nobody can say for sure how high it will actually go. In the end though, the price will be higher than it was before the bubble.

Libra does not threaten the central banks like Bitcoin does, because it's tied to central bank currencies. This means the central banks still have the benefit creating new money.

If the community finds out that central banks own most of Bitcoin they can simply move to an altcoin. If this happens again, then the community can again move a different altcoin. Since the central banks know this they won't even try to corner the market since it would likely result in just giving large amounts of money to the crypto community and they would prefer to give the money to their buddies anyway.

The lure of "getting rich" is also part of it. This is not a bad thing.

I wondered about this myself until I came up with the answer. The reason is participants on the futures market may buy actual bitcoin to hedge or arbitrage it.
Let's say a lot of Wallstreet money flows into the futures market and moves the Bitcoin price there way higher than you think it will be. For example, $10,000 at the end of the year. The smart thing to do would be to arbitrage it by buying Bitcoin now (for $7,000) and buying a put option for the same number of Bitcoins on the futures market. Come December 31st if the Bitcoin price is lower than $10,000 your put will be worth a lot of money. If though for whatever reason the Bitcoin price actually goes that high you will lose your put but still have your profit from buying Bitcoin to balance out the loss. In the above example if the Bitcoin price stays the same you would have made a profit of $3,000.
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:58:15
This is too conservative IMHO. We wouldn't even hit 2 MB until 2021.
Based on the historical growth of the Bitcoin network it would likely outgrow this limit within a few years.

I would argue that Bitcoin does not have to be a replacement for the current financial system in its entirety. It can exist in parallel to many different types of currencies. Just because it's not suitable to replace the dollar as a whole does not mean it's not worthwhile at all.
Also, I would argue that a money supply does not have to increase together with an increase in wealth. If the money supply stays the same and wealth increases, then it just means that prices go down. In this electronic age prices can be changed easily, it's not much work.
If you have a money supply that increases then the people who benefit from it are the ones who get the newly created money first, namely the central banks. Bitcoin is much fairer and "democratic" in that respect that if wealth increases and thus the value of Bitcoin goes up, then all holders of Bitcoin benefit from that accordingly.

This doesn't appear like a good idea to me. The thief would just torture you until he has the impression that he got all your Bitcoins, and then a bit more just to be on the safe side.

So maybe if people actually only spend what they really need then it would be better for everyone.
So what happens if there are less investments? The economy shrinks. And if the economy shrinks then there is less need for money, meaning that money becomes worth less, so no more deflation. Problem solved. It's a self-regulating cycle. 
The idea that deflation is bad with an equity-based currency is nonsense.

First you need to get Bitcoins. Read about on various other websites.
Then there are multiple possibilities to invest those Bitcoins.
One is so-called "Pirate-Bonds" (about 6%-7% per week) for example on:
 (6.9% per week)
You send the bitcoins to their website and they will give you interest each week, either paid out to you or reinvested.
Others are various bonds/stocks on:
Here again you send the bitcoins to the website, then buy the stocks/bonds, and receive the dividend payments on the website. You can withdraw your bitcoins anytime.
You can see a list of various yields on:
Also useful is to check out the various possibilities in the 'securities' section of the Bitcoin forum:

If you look at the charts it looks like history is going to repeat itself like 3 times beforehand. Which means it's going to drop something like 80% from the previous ATH. People will panic and despair, proclaim "it's all over". Then, "miraculously", the price will slowly recover and eventually reach a new ATH a year or two later.
@_date: 2012-03-03 10:52:08
At the moment it is still practical to do this. But several months when the coins have been spread and mixed far and wide it will become impractical. For example about a year ago there was a theft of 25,000 Bitcoins from a user named 'allinvain'. Those bitcoins are now dispersed and mixed into over 100,000 Bitcoin addresses. It's quite possible you actually have some of those coins right now.

This is actually quite smart on Roger's behalf. He only needs to pay if the hard fork happens and Segwit2x mines 100 blocks.
The most likely case is that Segwit2x will not fork or if it does it miners will quickly abandon it, so that the 100 blocks target will not be reached (because of the high difficulty). In either of these 2 cases Roger pays nothing.
If on the other hand 100 blocks of Segwit2x are mined then this likely means Segwit2x wins out against Segwit1x and thus Roger has a favorable exchange.
Basically, it's unlikely Roger will have a losing exchange.

After 7 years I do *not* consider Bitcoin extremely risky anymore. The software works reliably and has not been hacked in any significant way. The community is large and dedicated. Bitcoin has survived attacks and attempts to take it over. It is also designed to thwart being regulated or outlawed by governments. The community is constantly imagining possible attack vectors and trying to prevent them in advance.
I do not see any significant risk factor or uncertainty that we have overlooked. Where is the risk?

I'm mainly arguing against the idea that money *needs* to be reinvested otherwise the economy will suffer.
If there really is a need for some new business, then funding will appear somehow for it. This could be a loan, but also investors or crowdfunding are possible.
What we have at the moment is not really lack of funding but the opposite. Banks have low interest rates and are being put under pressure to loan money to all kinds of projects and property even though they are only marginally profitable. This leads to misallocation of wealth, such as which happened with the housing crisis.
If loans were harder to get by in a Bitcoin economy then people might put some serious consideration into whether to get a loan or not. I think this could be better overall for the economy.

My backup strategy is to have backup on two different hard drives on my computer, a USB stick I keep separately just for this, and on two websites like dropbox.
Also, this is very important, *do not overwrite* your old backup files but always add a new backup file to the drive. You can put the date into the filename so they are different.

The question is if we really need everybody to be able to run a full node.
It might suffice if there are some "archival" nodes which hold the entire blockchain while everybody else only holds the recent blocks.
If there would be about a thousand "full nodes" out there then IMHO it would be still decentralized enough to survive any attacks. For example, if each large Bitcoin handler (e.g. bank, market, merchant) would do so then we could reach that number easily.
@_date: 2013-03-06 11:01:55

In the Fiat world the rich have more than enough money to cover their cost of living and they can put the excess money in interest-bearing bonds and such. The money they get through interest exceeds the loss of value through inflation. Thus they are protected from inflation and get increasingly wealthy through the mathematical effect of interest.
Poor people on the other hand don't have any or very few savings and usually a fixed income which they need to cover their cost of living. That is why they get shafted by the effect of inflation.

There are two truths/lies, one is more one is less:
One truth to be revealed, is that there is *less* gold stored in central bank vaults/Fort Knox than officially acknowledged. This gold was bascially stolen by the "elites" and they have already spent most of it.
Another truth to be revealed, is that there is *more* gold in the world than officially acknowledged. The figure of the total amount of gold mined in history. This additional gold (which is about 10x the official figure) is stored in hidden vaults throughout Asia. This is is gold that was stolen mainly from Asia throughout the early 20th century.

The article assumes deflation is bad. This is only true for economies based on the fiat-style currencies we currently have. In such economies a contracting money supply represents a decline in investments which leads into a vicious cycle of decreasing prices/contracting money supply and thus even less investments. 
Such a vicious cycle would not occur with an asset-based currency. With an asset-based currency such as Bitcoin you have in fact a self-regulating system instead which evens out the ups and downs of the economy. If the value of Bitcoin increases then this leads to less investment because credit will become less attractive. Less investment leads to less growing of the economy thus less need for money thus the value of Bitcoin would decrease again. If on the other hand the value of Bitcoin drops then this makes credit more attractive thus more investment thus stimulating the economy, thus leading to more demand and thus more value for Bitcoin again.

“If you have persistent deflation, then simply holding the cash becomes a way of earning a return,” he tells WIRED. “If that’s the case, your economy will be starved of funds for investment and won’t be able to grow.”
The author of this quote has not thought this idea to its conclusion. If the economy does not grow anymore due to lack of spending then there is no reason for the currency to increase in value anymore. Thus the value of the currency will eventually not increase anymore and people will have the incentive to spend or invest.

The client seed doesn't change the random number generated by the server but it does change the result (i.e. if the user wins or not).
Otherwise, if I wanted to cheat as server operator I would just let the server always generate a '0' as server number and I would win every time (0=house wins).
Also the user does not have to manually write a client number. The javascript in the browser will automatically give a default number which the user can use if he does not want to type one in.

There are two aspects to the current financial system. One end is the usability it provides for economy and the other is the control it allows to a selected few. In the best scenario bitcoin would end the control by the select few but continue to provide usability to the economy. So bitcoin would only be disruptive really to the controllers, for the rest of the population the changeover could be smooth.

I think this is very good idea. It's better to inform these people and try to gain their support than to just simply oppose them. 
The interests that want to stop Bitcoin can only operate indirectly using covert means and through ignorance.
In the end though, there is nothing those agencies can really do to stop Bitcoin anyway.

How about a Bitcoin transaction messaging system? People could use this to add a message to a transaction
This would basically be a server that can store a message for each transaction signed by the sending address. 
You would have to ensure that only the receiving address could read the message. Perhaps the server would challenge somebody wanting to read the message to sign a random sentence with the private key of the receiving address.

A bubble is went something has a high price and that price is not actually justified. For example, when there actually is are larger supply of something than reflected in the price. The Tulip mania was a bubble because there were actually lots of Tulips and people could easily grow more. With Bitcoin there is a fixed, limited supply, and if a lot of people save it, even if they do not use it for commerce, then it is scare.

This mainly for making people aware of the fact that most currencies get their value from belief. This is something that is often forgotten. The implication is that this can be changed easily.

In a situation "where all else fails" and gold would be reduced to its material value almost any investmest, including dollars, saving certificates, stocks, bonds and so forth would be nearly worthless.

The current Bitcoin price, like many stocks and securities, is based on *future expectations*. It doesn't matter really how much it is used now, because people expect - and even Rick agrees with - that a Bitcoin will be worth much more in the future. 
Let's say Bitcoin has a 50% chance of being worth 10,000 US$ in ten years time. That would mean you would have a yearly gain of about 50% on your investment from today's price which is *very good* considering other types of investment.
Also comparing Bitcoin to US$ is not correct either, because Bitcoin is not just another "run of the mill" currency. It is a disruptive, revolutionary technology.
@_date: 2013-12-20 18:18:04
I actually think the decentralized nature of Bitcoin is more important than the cryptographic. 
You *could* devise a currency to be cryptographic and centralized.

No, you would need to get 51% of the nodes. Not the hashing power to do that. Already a single miner who accepts the transaction and then manages to find a block would be enough to add it to the network.

Sorry, I meant "remainder". The remaining number after integer division is the result.

By that time I think Bitcoin will be so widespread and integrated into the economy that government would not dare do that anymore. Just like attempts to regulate the Internet have failed. 
Plus no government could subpoena *all* full node operators if they were spread out over the entire globe. Just turning off a few nodes will not threaten the network and instead prompt a strong counter-reaction by the community. Just look at how ThePirateBay has survived despite massive attempts by governments to get rid of it.

The participants in the selfish mining pool could "betray" the operation by publishing the private blocks (if more than 1 ahead) for their own reward.

They were lumped together for tactical reasons. They don't want to make it appear as if bitcoin is the real target, so they pretend to be concerned about alternative payment systems in general.
