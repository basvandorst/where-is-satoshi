@_date: 2018-08-14 20:48:55

@_date: 2018-08-14 21:19:28

@_date: 2017-08-22 11:30:26
Exactly 
@_date: 2017-08-01 19:13:20

@_date: 2017-11-08 16:49:37

@_date: 2017-11-02 15:05:47
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:20:56
yeah thats what everyone said before the bch fork, so how did that turn out again?
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:12:21
Maybe or maybe more people invested in bitcoin
We don't know
@_date: 2017-11-06 02:01:54
I've experienced the same thing, people I've been telling to buy since 2013 are now in the last month asking me how to buy
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:21:29
i also bought the ath, 3 years ago
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:55:31
How would one do this if you don't mind me asking
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:31:46
hold me
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:45:18
thank you for this response.  my problem im having is pulling profits...into what?
non of the exchanges im on have real fiat, so im pulling into usdt, we all know what thats worth. 
 So my question is this, when you say drawdown, what are you drawing down to? and where? are you pulling off the exchange?
@_date: 2017-11-08 13:54:50
if he bought right before the last fork (BCH), he would be laughing
@_date: 2017-11-23 05:52:06
@_date: 2018-02-21 16:25:29
the "im going to cry camp" yes lets not forget about them
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:07:53
no this isnt a public forum where decisions are made democratically, you are responsible for your own actions here.  You can talk about it all you want, but until you put your money where your mouth is, youre just full of hot air.
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:26:13
oh its great cryptoyota! tell us, by your estimation what should random numbers and letters be worth?
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:47:26
Never sold? Isn't that kind of a stupid move? I mean what's the end game? 1 million or bust?
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:02:48
bitcoin is at 3100 this is already old
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:32:08
will you buy then?
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:43:34
why isnt this highter?
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:27:02
you can talk about it all you want, if it makes you feel better. But id suggest therapy if its really bothering you.
@_date: 2017-10-10 13:59:40
did you ever remember these 72 characters?
@_date: 2018-02-22 15:18:13

@_date: 2017-09-15 07:02:48

@_date: 2017-10-03 13:34:09
