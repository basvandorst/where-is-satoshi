definitely not. blockchain is just one of the technologies utilized to create something way way beyond a payment system.
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:00:33
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:54:10
why not?  both parties are rewarded for referrals.
@_date: 2017-02-02 20:53:44
or there are single entities trying to control the conversation on both sides. dominating the conversations in ways to guide/ manipulate people. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:17:52
definitely not a floor haha. more like a tight rope walker above the grand canyon balancing half of china on his shoulders.

@_date: 2017-02-09 17:36:38
these are small discrepancies between exchanges. all the reall high volume exchanges are within .1-1.5% of eachother. selling in cash in person etc. is a completely different story. youre full of shit.  
@_date: 2017-02-14 22:27:29
shittiest "article" ive read in awhile
@_date: 2017-02-16 03:11:41
yes here we go again :D
@_date: 2017-02-28 21:54:27
I wouldnt be surprised if they went down during time of announcement 
@_date: 2017-02-26 06:00:37
@_date: 2017-02-13 23:36:18
True, but you have to recognize very few have been following since 2013. Know when to hold and know when to fold em. Im personally excited for the bloodbath 
@_date: 2017-02-09 15:10:08
These buyers are scared and about to have hands shaken loose, as it continues to move lower. 
@_date: 2017-02-26 09:05:46
I guess so... they currently owe me about 400 usd
@_date: 2017-02-27 16:57:09
im not talking about otc prices
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:08:46
lol 1200 dollar wall in usd is just other value in other currency. wtf you saying?
@_date: 2017-02-28 17:57:22
like a poll matters lol how many people actually do what they are "planning" on doing. gotta know when to hold em and know when to fold em
@_date: 2017-02-17 07:28:16
what an image haha
@_date: 2017-02-27 01:32:27
Yeah if i was getting double bitcoin every order i wouldnt be here. what a day that would be. honestly gdax is shit and im confused why wouldnt think otherwise. most stock trading platforms make it look like shit + they have a terrible selection of order options. only plus is there api
@_date: 2017-02-09 20:09:11
Kinda interesting, Szabo's essay that was just released discusses this idea in depth. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 23:25:03
What your failing to take into account is that the etf has been "priced in for awhile". you can even tell by how much discussion has taken place on the topic. You will be very sad when the etf is denied. Expect a blood bath. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 06:13:31
its funny there's no one here who ever wants to explain anything...
@_date: 2017-02-16 22:54:48
not trrue
@_date: 2017-02-28 03:10:40
I never said it wasnt valid economic activity. but its an outlier is what it is. and statistically insignificant 
@_date: 2017-02-26 07:22:05
so would a reply
@_date: 2017-02-27 17:00:45
Gox lead all the other exchanges, so gox price is the only one that makes any sense to look back at. 
@_date: 2017-02-01 16:34:45
if bitcoin is really adapted world wide it'll be a 100x + return. 
@_date: 2017-02-13 05:36:46
whats the process of checking it contents? 
@_date: 2017-02-01 17:24:18
so your buying power was $105,000... thats quite the difference
@_date: 2017-03-08 06:13:20
you could lose all your money
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:15:46
how do you not get what im trying to point out bro. The high is the same value regardless of currency. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:28:05
closer to 2 weeks
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:55:27
Those were a good laugh
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:45:24
yeah for sure. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:28:59
price action does not look good to me...
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:52:21
smh you should have transferred cash first... you could even do wire transfer in one day. don did fucked up
@_date: 2017-03-27 01:02:29
No lmfao you just pressed a link at some point that happened to be that persons referral 
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:11:32
Bull shit you do
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:12:01
Exactly im not recieving the bitcoin it says are filled. Thats why im unhappy. Why would i be making thia stuff up? Haha
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:54:37
if CIA controls your computer, they control your bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:54:49
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:17:35
this has absolutely no significance 
@_date: 2017-02-09 17:34:36
if you only realized how dumb you sound
@_date: 2017-03-10 03:00:41
Just as much FUD as all the posts saying the opposite. Like this is the cheapest youll ever get it again, bitcoin 10k by 2018 etc. Seems that people only call out the FUD when its not aligned with what they think will happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:02:41
Im not telling you what indicators i use and back test 
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:51:03
I think youre missing the point I'm trying to make. If your computer is owned by the CIA, which it most certainly is. Seeing that they have a "wide range" of hacking capabilities. The bitcoin network is not decentralized if the CIA has control of it lol 
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:53:16
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:50:32
@_date: 2017-03-19 18:46:55
Obviously there's intermittent spikes. They happened all the way down. The trend has shifted though. As i was saying. If you always make bad calls like that you wont be trading for long 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:40:35
ya, well if you have no data to go on youre gonna make bad trades
@_date: 2017-03-09 23:58:38
if thats the case it means most exchanges will also be down. 
@_date: 2017-03-18 15:25:12
Says a guy shorting bitcoins
@_date: 2017-03-02 17:03:17
where did you hear that? and when are they being launched?
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:42:52
can we hodl each other?
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:15:58
You think theyll anounce on monday? 
@_date: 2017-02-26 17:12:44
Which its doing to me :(    i want my fucking money back 
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:49:53
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:36:34
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:56:29
so what do you think about my analysis now?
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:43:59
Ok, i cancled my netflix subscription after losing 10% of my life savings today. I do have some dvds.
@_date: 2017-03-21 04:50:09
interested in those indicators now? lol
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:46:52
the days before my weenie got roasted
@_date: 2017-03-17 23:10:48
750 is next
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:31:03
so unlikely
@_date: 2017-03-18 13:56:06
i second that
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:59:59
when you hook it up to your computer, yes
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:14:14
I wont deny it, im a straight rider. But it doesnt seem that when people expect those returns they ever happen. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 17:44:24
recognize that if youre asking these questions youre gonna lose money 
@_date: 2017-03-08 21:28:40
what would you call the 10% drop then?
@_date: 2017-03-08 20:48:49
just a pull back ;)
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:26:12
Yes it does!  :D
@_date: 2017-03-21 17:08:30
Money talks and bullshit walks. Asking me if I'm a trading. Stating your current position (short), then you get absolutely rekt, and start talking about your intermittent spikes.
@_date: 2017-03-08 23:09:20
Price action says other wise 
@_date: 2017-03-10 21:44:01
no fucking shit. they should have been able to anticipate the amount of traffic regardless. theyre just cheap bastards
@_date: 2017-03-09 05:32:16
The computer is the means by which you make transactions. If they control computers they have the means to interupt the network 
@_date: 2017-03-27 00:24:53
ya i did, also from someone i didnt know
@_date: 2017-03-19 17:38:03
wow thats an early cover for someone shorting the continuation of the downward momentum 
@_date: 2017-03-11 02:23:43
ya and pawn shops are a danger to gold etfs
@_date: 2017-03-10 04:17:31
How would be easy to sell if you didnt have access to an exchange? 
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:39:54
so how much did you lose?
@_date: 2017-02-16 05:37:43
yes, i highly suggest you read their entire website. all filings are made public. you should know how to search through them
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:01:36
congratulations you used the words CIA, isis, and USA in the same post. the CIA is now gathering more of your data. 
@_date: 2017-03-11 01:26:56
lol i couldnt tell. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 00:42:39
lol and imagine the exchanges being down and its dropping like a rock hahahha
@_date: 2017-03-08 05:13:59
no... just no.
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:21:00
well then you dont understand bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-19 02:40:28
for a small fee ill tell you when to cover shorts in the future 
@_date: 2017-03-08 02:15:39
i can check it for you :)
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:07:50
Not even close, sales in crypto are a tiny fraction of their business. Like she said they want to accumulate bitcoin for the long term, so they dont even need that liquidity.
@_date: 2019-08-19 15:30:30
It's nice to see one of bitcoins main use cases actually being utilized.
@_date: 2019-10-10 00:10:32
Your right that is worse. And these people think they'll have someone to sell to.
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:19:19
Funnel the sheeple.
@_date: 2019-08-19 17:15:15
If you knew anything about taxes and could look at chart you would know that's nowhere in the realm of possibilities.
@_date: 2019-10-09 22:07:36
Imagine getting upvoted for posting the same meme over and over again.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:20:00
When you pretend to know what bitcoin is but couldn't take even if someone was giving it away.
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:28:32
That guy lmao
@_date: 2019-10-03 15:00:15
Already is on everyone not educated in finances.
@_date: 2019-02-18 09:59:26
It's funny to see people who have bought and held btc now getting upset that Andreas is working to pump their bags anymore. 
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:23:54
I guess i need to read over the white paper again but i thought the basket of investments backing it were also things other than currencies?
@_date: 2019-06-20 08:27:48
Damn outperforming AAPL by almost 10x in a third of the time. Neckbeards had their moment thats for sure.

If monthly wage is the price of btc transaction how can it possibly help them?
@_date: 2019-12-05 12:34:46
I'm the one who makes those! and You can even spend Bitcoin  [
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:10:04
Hey guys since yesterday bitcoin is up, so bear market over. Zingerrrrrrrrrr
@_date: 2019-12-18 22:13:19
No were sharing CNN articles because they confirm our bias. This subreddit is a mess.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:53:35
This shows that we are in for another big mainstream hype cycle.
@_date: 2019-12-06 19:11:58
This is sad lol people should be doing things to increase its value. Not wait.
@_date: 2019-12-15 21:09:26
Price is below that of previous ATH so yes we are in a bear market ��������
@_date: 2017-04-12 18:24:43
this is ridiculous. why cant i log in?
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:23:55
fuckin suck my nuts gdax, and fuck your api
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:03:44
I didnt know you could actually buy these with bitcoin. This changes a lot lol 
@_date: 2017-04-12 20:52:07
Me too. Its fucking bullshit
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:19:31
lol the pump continues. sorry to tell you its not getting activated though. antpool throwing in the cock block. people bout to make some cash shorting 
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:07:35
Yes they are paying above average market value. No its not, which is why other exchanges are 4% below bitfinex. There are plenty of other exchanges to send btc and withdrawal usd. 
@_date: 2017-04-03 10:41:31
Oh ya, i forgot why i had such a hard time figuring anything out about him
@_date: 2017-04-04 23:24:26
and the source is?
@_date: 2017-04-05 00:02:07
Ya, im sure everyone is dropping money on new mining rigs too.
@_date: 2017-04-15 01:13:35
Arbitrage field day if you trust bitfinex 
@_date: 2019-04-04 15:02:04
Lightning and moon... gets old. 
@_date: 2017-04-13 19:47:00
Ya thatd be some shit. Weird thing is its there, just in another account. Why the fuck i have 2 USD accounts 
@_date: 2017-04-05 06:34:20
No, no one is renting the hashing power to signal segwit. Maybe bigger players. Not happening until another pool signals
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:52:13
what if you get paid in bitcoins? and thats all you have to spend? being in the bitcoin network exclusively and not having to switch back and forth is the best thing you could possibly do. 
@_date: 2017-04-06 02:42:17
Honestly who cares. Either their miners allow for fixes, or price goes down eventually killing bitcoin. and people will move to alternative like Decred. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:02:08
Ya they are, obviously not many people withdrawal in those currencies though. 
@_date: 2019-04-04 00:18:20
I think theres a lot more to be concerned about than a little thc in your system. 
@_date: 2017-04-15 02:03:19
Why are you typing things when you have no clue what youre saying
@_date: 2019-09-14 20:38:21
Hah! Ok buddy tax exemptions for exchanging the same type of property were not in place 2017.
@_date: 2019-09-15 22:41:44
People buying things with bitcoin being upvoted on r/bitcoin seems so strange. What happen to SOV?
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:01:30
Might not even be here yet.
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:00:56
Governments can only resist the reach of corporations for so long.
@_date: 2019-09-12 22:04:10
Why would you spend your bitcoin on a soccer ticket though?
@_date: 2019-09-13 00:58:19
2017 same loophole for cryptos existed in usa.
@_date: 2019-09-12 18:23:20
So Tether does have a use case! Avoiding taxes!
@_date: 2019-09-27 13:40:34
Imagine being in the comments congratulating each other on how much money you've lost. Only in crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-14 20:39:58
I have no idea what IRS code section 1031 is ������
@_date: 2019-09-13 01:00:18
For this to work the people that are disenfranchised need to be able to spend the currency in their community to continue operating.
@_date: 2019-09-22 21:26:40
And all of you missed the gains ������
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:36:25
But the fees are so high for bitcoin, why would you use it to buy a soccer ticket.
@_date: 2019-09-30 15:57:27
Buy banks ���������� I dont if the ceo of bitcoin would approve
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:46:29
You should only spend from a btc address once.
@_date: 2019-09-15 23:01:44
Lmao are you kidding me? Hardware wallets are way less secure than a simple paper wallet.

Hardware wallets are so stupid. Noon level 10000.
