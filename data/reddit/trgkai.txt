Too bad the coins used to buy that home were basically stolen.  The buyer was Josh Zerlan, AKA Inaba from Butterfly Labs.

GPU mining didn't exist until mid/late 2010, and BitMinter (which is what he claimed to use) didn't exist until mid 2011.

This is incorrect in the US.
The current IRS regulations for mined coins is as follows:  When you mine coins, the value of the coins on the day they are generated is INCOME to you, and this value is now your basis in those coins when sold in the future.  
You will be taxed on that income in the year you mined the coins.  If you properly set it up as a business, you can depreciate your equipment and deduct your utilities used to mine the coins to offset that income.
You now have a capital asset that when sold for a gain or loss will be reported as Short or Long Term capital gains based on the date of sale vs date mined.
All of this assumes you are not cheating on your taxes by failing to report income at the time it was mined.
EDIT:  And if you want it straight from the IRS -   , Q-8.

Just going to say that hiring developers with a deep understanding of Bitcoin is pretty hard, considering the most experienced ones have most likely have secured enough wealth to comfortably retire.

The big drops are always significantly faster than the rises...not sure where you've been this whole time.

You've doomed us to a crash of such epic proportions that the market cap of Bitcoin will be $3,000.  I hope you're happy about that.
