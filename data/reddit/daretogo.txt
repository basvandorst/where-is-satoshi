Open a coinbase/gdax account, submit good docs and wait to get verified.  Deposit BTC to coinbase, xfer to gdax and sell using limit order based on current price. Withdrawal USD to coinbase, then out at rate of 5k/day to your bank account.

I've successfully used this same technique a few time to pay low fees in a transfer that I wasn't concerned with speed on.
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:21:44
Do you even bitcoin?  There are supremely defined limits of production and total number of BTC that will ever exist.

How do I invest in the internet?  What can I do on the internet? 
Pick a crypto, any crypto - they're all blockchain.  BTC was the first, but there are many. 
Pick a website, any website - they're all on the internet.  Some random cern website was the first, but there are many.  
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:16:10
Any one of over 1300 crypto currencies.

Why though?  What makes it superior?  Literally every altcoins claim to fame is "We do X thing well that bitcoin currently does poorly"
Is your position just that once bitcoin adds roughly equivalent feature that it's position as 'first' will give it the weight to squash the altcoins?

What month in 2013? I made my account in April and it is there, another fellow in this thread said he made his in June and it was not there.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:02:56
So since I know what my password is/was, and now I have the hash what sort of black magic can I do to figure out what hashing algorithm they used? 
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:29:50
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:52:44
I must be mistaken/stupid, but looking at my screenshot you can see that to the best of my ability I am telling the truth about when the account was registered.  
I honestly don't understand.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:01:26
I made my account April 2013 and it is there. So that narrows down the window of the hack to be sometime after April 11th 2013 but before whenever in June 2013 your account was created.
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:05:16
Yup. I was freaking out for a min.   It seems had a copy of the 2011 list and somehow I am on that as well. I totally don't get it, but yea...
@_date: 2014-02-07 05:04:02
I must be mistaken or stupid. You can see from my screenshot when it indicates my Gox account was created... I don't really know how to prove that I didn't manipulate it. 
I certainly was messing around with Bitcoin in 2011, my wallet seems to indicate my first transaction was 6/14/2011.  Did gox at some point delete old accounts and perhaps I recreated one?
@_date: 2014-02-07 03:33:36
I can confirm this is legit. Checked the link from the twitter post and my account name and email address are there - it does NOT have my password in plain text however. Seems like maybe it's a hash of my password?
So glad that I used a very complex unique password just for MtGox.
@_date: 2014-08-31 04:31:44
They lost a sale from me for this reason as well. The i7-4790 has a "free gift" of a sweepstakes entry that invalidates the Bitcoin promo :-(

Edit:  I created my Gox account on April 11th, 2013  so it is at least that recent
Proof:   
I've left my email address and username in the email exposed so you can check it against the list for yourself if you like. Even if someone manages to get into my Gox account I didn't have anything in it and the password was unique to that account so I don't really care. 
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:04:28
That is really odd. I created my account April 2013 and it is on the list.
@_date: 2014-02-07 04:00:32
It is NOT the same list. 
I just double checked my email to be sure and I created my account April 11th 2013 on Gox... it is in that list.
If it was the list from 2011 then my info would not be there.

Bitcoin are rigged, the whole thing is rigged I tell you.

It's still a functional currency.  If you want to HODL and spend you can do both.  Spend BTC, immeadiately purchase same amount with your USD and "replace" the spent BTC.
No loss :-)
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:50:36
I'm not going to re-read this article to verify, but it covers someone using this hack to recover their own BTC from their trezor due to a forgotten pin and lost seed words. 
@_date: 2015-08-08 06:28:02
I use BTC and am in the market for a Office 365 sub for the unlimited OneDrive storage - pray-tell what is your company?
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:06:22
Pop the transaction number into the ViaBTC transaction accelerator.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:10:40
Yea, I was talking without doing any reading.  Popped over to the btcrecover github and it seems it's designed to do exactly that: 


I was browsing the trezor github last night and the seedword list is something like 2K words long, so if you can identify which of the seedwords you doubt is correct I'd guess you've got a shot.  
Sorry I can't help with specifics of getting btcrecover up and running.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:05:25
Not impossible.  It would just take a few million years with current compute power. 
I do wonder though, if he has the seed words which are incorrect but presumably close to the actual seed words if some sort of targeted approach to running variations of those seed words through key generations would reduce the needed time significantly enough to be valuable. 
@_date: 2012-05-27 12:22:51
Color me interested. Brand? Any special features (reference card? Black edition? Anything like that?)
@_date: 2018-11-12 01:30:42
I held 2 BTC through the rise to $20k/btc and ended up selling them for $7500 each when I really needed the funds for something that was more important to me.  
The advice, or rather thought framing question that I ignored that I regret was this:
If you had $475,000 in your bank account, would you use it to buy Bitcoin?  
If the answer is no, then I think you need to strongly consider selling. 
@_date: 2011-08-27 22:55:59
I know what you were hoping for, and I am disappoint too.
@_date: 2011-11-29 10:26:15
I literally LOL'd at this.
@_date: 2015-11-09 17:33:31
Can confirm, just did exactly this and have pre-loaded. T minus 12 hours or so.
@_date: 2015-11-09 19:30:59
Ohhhh... Devious!
I like it -though I'm at work so I probably won't bother.
@_date: 2013-04-13 00:43:42
Sell 120 of them at $120 to recoup your initial investment and now you have 80 bitcoins for free to enjoy the rest of the ride with.

You need to be on the TOR network in order to get to the site. Easiest way is to just download the Tor Browser bundle:
Then once on, go to the super secret URL for silkroad (lol, I'll PM it to you).  Then transfer coins to your account there and buy :-)
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:05:46
2nd Question then:  What would be the price that would make you bite TODAY for a 100GH miner?  $1000?  $500?
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:47:40
Not the SC single - the FPGA ones that have been out for a while.  Used, but verifiably real.
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:40:55
That's awsome. You just got your bitcoins, though the tipbot is lagging and may take a few hours. 
Here's the documentation you'll need:
@_date: 2013-04-14 08:11:35
I'd wager that if you hold out long enough you'll see your return, but what do I know - I'm just a random dude on the Internet.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:48:14
Not the ASIC single, the FPGA single that "only" mines at 800mhs. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:12:17
Unless you have the wallet.dat (aka the private keys) to the address then you quite simply can't.
@_date: 2013-04-11 21:39:13
The reason things are the way they are is because lots of people like you own bitcoins that are "completely in the dark on how things work".
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:12:50
I bought as many as I could with the BTC I have (had). 
@_date: 2013-10-27 17:10:49
Wow, do we really believe that by Sep 14 difficulty will be up to 4097008 (MM) from 391 (MM) of today?
That's seriously exponential!
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:52:20
I can get 2 more at that price - but I worry that if the ASIC folks actually ship that I'll end up with hardware that has no value.

That's a concern for sure. With my measly 450mhs my GPUs are pulling in about .03 btc per day - if BTC stays over $200/coin that makes more than enough profit to pay my electric bill...
