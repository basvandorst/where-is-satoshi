It currently does not cost me money to send the texts. I am sending them as emails (i.e sending an email to 1234567890
There is a down side to this though, as a lot of carriers classify emails like this as "spam" and they might come in as texts from generic numbers.
If I continue to receive great support like this I will most likely switch to using Twilio and just bite the bullet on the costs.

I have not implemented it! These are great things that i'm hearing that make me happy I went to reddit first for feedback!

Hi! At the current time, this feature has only been tested for Coin to USD pairs.
Something that I will definitely look towards doing is working on the coin to coin trading pairs and computing profits that way. It wouldn't be very hard, as I could use the timestamp from the trade to make a historical price query on the GDAX API to get what the price was at that current time :)

Yeah that's exactly what's happening. I anticipated very little traffic so I was going to use the built in flask deployment server for the time being.
Looks like I can't do that. Gotta switch it up to nginx/gunicorn today!

That is a goal for the future, however, the new website which provides the exact same functionality will be out in a few hours!

The new website is out now

Thanks for the advice I really appreciate it.
As for the continue button not working. I received WAYYY more traffic than I anticipated so I'm going to spend some time later and change up my web server deployment options.

Deed has been reluctantly done.

Thanks for the advice. I’m feeling really comfortable moving to this new small company. My previous job was at a large hedge fund and I wasn’t a big fan of my role and how management worked. I was reached out to regarding this new job and it couldn’t have been any more perfect for my career goals.

Right [here!](
You can plug in your GDAX API credentials, your gmail address (to send the texts to you), and your phone number.
The only other thing this requires is a text file in the project directory. 
If you use this I would recommend using cron to schedule the file to run every X seconds/minutes (where X = frequency).

Thanks for providing this information man! Yes, I want to make sure everyone knows that anything other than a VIEW ONLY api key can be dangerous.
Although my code is publicly visible and I am only reading your completed orders, there is obviously a trust level required on your end to give me the API key. Nobody here knows who I am and I fully understand that!
**If you provide anything more than VIEW ONLY your API key CAN be used to transfer your money/coins and steal them.**
If anyone does not feel comfortable doing so, you are more than welcome to use [the previous version]( of this code and run it locally on your machine. This means that you are entering your API credentials locally on your own machine.
I am in the process of building out the website, which will include instructions as to how to do the above.

Sorry I should have been a little more clear. I didn't learn to code from scratch in 2 weeks. I've been programming for about 4.5 years (4 of which were in college studying Computer Science). I learned Swift in a little under 2 weeks. Sure it was a lot easier for me having a background in programming, but it's really not that hard.
I always find that the best way to learn a new programming language is to jump right into it. In my opinion, you pick up the syntax as you go.

If they have an API it wouldn’t take more than an hour or so for me to implement it!

The app is totally free. There's no ads/monetizing/fees of any way, shape, or form.
I plan on furthering my iOS development skills by adding new features from user suggestions.

I'm not too sure in terms of personal projects, but I just left my first job (I'm 22, so I'm unfortunately fitting the job-hopping millennial stereotype) and am starting my dream job at a super small (&lt; 10 employees) startup in a few days, so I'm really excited for that.

I just added addresses to the top post. I'm only adding them because you mentioned it, so please don't feel like I did this for donations!
