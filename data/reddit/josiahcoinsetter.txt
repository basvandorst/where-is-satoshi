wouldn't that be an extremely expensive attack to maintain?

Glad to hear Chain won out in the end for this pilot. They're a great shop!
One small step for NASDAQ, one giant leap for Bitcoin :')
@_date: 2015-06-02 05:50:07
it would be an extremely costly attack to maintain that can be still be negated with a switch away from SHA256 (although that's admittedly a big switch).
@_date: 2015-06-24 15:56:06
For anyone confused &amp; downvoting, this is positive. It means doing a great job!
@_date: 2015-06-17 21:26:45
Always a fun time at the Embassy, I hear :)
@_date: 2015-06-02 06:02:08
The hashrate required to solo mine with any realistic likelihood of ever finding a block is pretty significant. As I see it, significant in this case translates to expensive.
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:12:45
Not necessarily considering the amount of bids only dropped by 44%. If the increase in bid size was solely caused by Barry breaking up into larger pieces the increase in avg block size should have been more in the realm of 227%. [=((1/~.44)100)]
Even when accounting for larger sized blocks, there's still a very notable increase in average size... I think
EDIT: formula looked weird 
@_date: 2015-06-28 04:01:38
Awesome, thanks for this!!
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:28:47
Coinsetter offers an OTC desk for block trades that would allow you to get a fixed price for $$/BTC. I'm sending you a PM with details if you're interested.
@_date: 2014-12-19 19:29:37
In no specific order of course :)
@_date: 2014-12-05 20:29:18
Or the amount of bidders in the syndicate this time around
@_date: 2015-05-21 20:37:31
I've been thinking about this for a while. If there's anything I can do to help, I'm more than interested.
I was just going to put a bunch of stickers up with encrypted private keys for an address holding a lot of money. Maybe have something printed on it saying "I'd like to see you do this with you credit card number"... You'r idea is definitely better haha
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:22:18
We offer this as a heads up. 50% insurance on all bitcoin deposits through Xapo (at no cost).
[Here's the official announcement/release]( if you're interested in reading up on the program a bit more.

To join in with Jaron here, 'tiny' is also a very relative term. The entirety of bitcoin exchange-traded volume in 2014 (~$8.9bn, according to bitcoinity.org) is 'tiny' compared to volume on mainstream asset exchanges on a single day. 
With that in mind, it becomes much easier to level the playing field in terms of volume in the long run. 
TL;DR: A few hundred thousand $$ in volume difference may seem like a lot now, but as the market scales up, that difference becomes more &amp; more insignificant
EDIT: wording, citation
@_date: 2015-01-23 16:17:32
Great point. Not saying we don't have a lot of work ahead of us, I'm simply  questioning the painted level of significance that market share holds today.
After all, within the past two years how many times has the torch of 'market leader' changed hands?
@_date: 2015-01-18 23:02:31
The thing is, I wouldn't necessarily say this is about the price. More about the fundamentals. Bitcoin's market structure is being developed right now and I'm just trying to encourage us all to make informed decisions on how we decide to develop it.
@_date: 2015-01-26 04:29:21
Haha I like the creativity but that's a negative. 
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:47:50
I honestly can't remember how many 3AM nights I lost to this site when I first got into bitcoin... 
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:24:11
How's it going Faisal? 
By the way guys, CoinX has been around for quite a while now. They're an awesome team and have made incredible progress on the regulatory front. 
They have some pretty cool non-exchange solutions as well.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:48:30
Hopefully not! We need everyone to read this and understand it if we want adoption to continue its exponential growth.
But definitely a great link.
@_date: 2015-01-23 22:21:29


@_date: 2015-01-18 22:44:56
Awesome, first tip ever. Much appreciated kind stranger! :)
@_date: 2015-01-26 02:34:05
No derivs yet. Although, we do have a margin and post-trade settlement program--worth noting though is that it's only for businesses and institutional traders. 
If you're interested in reading more on it, [here's the full announcement/release.](
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:16:49
To answer, yep, certainly. A quick email to our team would help you move to a new withdrawal address. 
I always try to develop lines of communication with customers that reach out, so they have someone to connect with directly should a need like this ever come up. 
@_date: 2015-01-23 19:32:45
One of my favorite quotes: 


I definitely see where you're coming from, but I agree with Jaron's way of doing things here. Ultimately, I personally believe it's more important to make sure your customer is truly satisfied and feels important than it is to impress them with your sense of authority.
If I'm straw-manning things really badly right now feel free to let me know so haha.
@_date: 2015-01-18 22:42:11
Good point. Ie our new post-trade settlement program is noteworthy for any firm we talk to that trades actively in normal markets. It's the way things work with them--it integrates nicely into existing workflows (something that I feel BTC companies need to work on doing more).
Some people in the community frown on the program however, because of their disagreement with margin practices. 
There are a lot of risks to think about when dealing with counterparties you're trading with. There are no bitcoin clearing houses or even SROs to regulate settlement practices/collateral rules. These are some of the questions on the mind of anyone 'legit' looking into the space, and margin helps to relieve the pressure of storing large amounts of capital on an exchange. THIS IS NOT FRACTIONAL RESERVE. All of this capital is company controlled capital (not customers).
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:40:02
We actually insure bitcoin deposits through Xapo--approximately 50% and at no cost.
The program release/announcement [can be found here]( if you're interested in reading up on it.
@_date: 2015-01-18 21:37:19
Pretty sure the high prices are because it's actually intended for use as a textbook. I got it for $60 on google play books on my phone
@_date: 2015-01-26 21:30:19


I may have not clarified the point of the post enough, but this was it. 
I get what you're saying though, I definitely can try to be more to-the-point, moving forward!
@_date: 2015-01-15 16:50:52
If your bank supports SWIFT wire transfers, then Coinsetter should be able to help you out with this!
I'll shoot you a PM with my direct email to help get started if you're interested.
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:01:02
While I may not appreciate their aggressive language, in all fairness, it's great marketing.
You seem like you're pretty interested in this stuff and have some good questions. I shot you a PM with my company email if there's ever anything we could clarify or help out with!
EDIT: 2nd paragraph  
@_date: 2015-01-25 23:06:37
Thanks for that bracketed clarification :)
+100 bits @_date: 2015-01-26 02:36:31
Coinsetter is actually US-based... It's bit complicated and I don't want to say too much without chatting with our legal team first. But I'll follow up with more details if they give me the OK tomorrow!
@_date: 2015-01-26 03:13:04
Wish I could have been more helpful on those points specifically. The announcement itself will provide much more clarity on these, I'm sure.
And nope, thank you. I've been looking at the same screen (my outlook client) all day, sending emails--a break was exactly what I needed. :)
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:14:35
You're literally everywhere... Much respect :)
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:59:30
Gotcha, so mostly just the appearance of the rest of the old site?
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:19:11
If you don't mind me asking, what about Cavirtex caused the switch? 
We're always trying to improve our customer's experience and focus on ways to actively add-value, so any feedback here is hugely helpful!!
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:13:39
We'd greatly appreciate it, and feel free to shoot over any feedback directly!
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:27:09
Great question here Tom (apologies if that's not actually your name). To answer, the margin is backed by company capital. 
I don't want to speak for anyone else, but I think it's safe to say most people involved in bitcoin before 2014 (we were founded in 2012) are trying to stay as far away from fractional reserve practices as possible, for fundamental reasons.
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:12:14
I will say, of the many companies I talked to when we made the move into Canada, you guys are definitely among my favorite.
Happy to see the guys pushing bitcoin forward probably more than anyone else in Canada also know what they're doing on the trading/liquidity side :)
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:17:06
Greatly appreciated there buddy!!
@_date: 2015-07-13 20:27:18
I hear Bitaccess is crushing it up there! :)
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:14:15
If you could possibly PM me your username / email for Cavirtex, I'll get in touch with the support team to see how we can best expedite things for you!
@_date: 2015-07-13 15:24:09
We've realize that traders and market participants always appreciate some personal interactions. It's the closest we're going to get to meeting you and shaking your hand, over the internet :)
@_date: 2015-04-08 18:36:26
Absolutely, our first plan is to integrate our tech. Expect millisecond latency and solid API connectivity options for Canadian bitcoin trading, moving forward :)
@_date: 2015-03-12 17:04:55
Interesting, could you possibly elaborate a bit on what makes it so difficult vs more traditional viewing styles? 
Some people have told us they actually prefer the way this is set up, as it helps parse through titles to more easily find interesting/relevant articles. 
@_date: 2015-03-17 01:39:02
Great decision by the CB team and congrats Zane! 
@_date: 2015-02-22 17:21:06
Glad to see UC is still going strong! Being able to capture even a fraction of the multi-trillion $ swaps market on-blockchain would be an incredible booster for BTC.
