Man, this Subreddit is so weird. I love you guys. But man sometimes I wonder who all of you really are.
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:21:23
I never said its a conspiracy. I said it has happened before. And it's just a strange occurrence. 
@_date: 2015-06-08 21:09:26
No, that this community is composed of so many individuals that mislead and falsify information. How do we know this is a Chinese dude? 
How many times have we seen members of this community pretend to be someone else to imply a larger usage of the technology to drive the value up or down? 
I'm not paranoid about it or anything, I just think it's strange.

This reads like a WWII propaganda poster.
@_date: 2014-03-10 06:12:48
Yeah, I totally agree. It's remarkable how a simple font use can change the whole image of a product. They should have used something much more bold and neutral.
Coinbase does this flawlessly. I mean this app is so close to the way Coinbase looks already...

"Sex offender that was hunting my son"
That is the most terrifying collection of words I've read on Reddit. 
I'm really sorry you had to deal with that.
@_date: 2015-01-15 19:03:05
May I ask why you are here then? Just curious.
@_date: 2015-01-22 18:40:58
Corruption IS like half the BTC market.
@_date: 2015-01-23 06:08:09
The sad truth is that most of them are buggy pieces of shit.

Good lord. That title.

I'm playing devils advocate, but did the users you referred actually buy the stipulated amount of bitcoin? 
They need to buy $100+ worth of BTC.
@_date: 2015-07-19 18:12:04
You can also download numerous Bitcoin ticker apps that place a widget in your notifications bar. They are generally more in depth and provide more exchange options. Assuming you have updated to the latest version of iOS.
@_date: 2015-08-07 03:18:59
A real human bean.
@_date: 2015-07-21 08:46:10
Im sorry if this is unproductive, but who is naming these exchanges and startups? They are so uninspired and often make no god damn sense. Coinffeine?! Buttercoin?! 
How are those names to inspire a level of professional confidence or even a hint of what those companies provide?
I see this all over the Bitcoin ecosystem and it boggles my mind.

Is there a return on running an ATM? Or is it a sunk cost?
@_date: 2013-11-02 21:45:51
I'm trying to spread my interest and hope to individuals around me. The benefits to society and our relationships from this concept are huge. I don't think it's possible to fully realize the scope of such an endeavor. You guys are awesome and I'm glad I've found a community of people who are so interested in the advancement of bitcoins and the development of each other.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:42:55
You are also an idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-24 14:36:13
Fuck off, nut job.
@_date: 2013-11-19 02:29:16
They are not an exchange but a broker.
@_date: 2013-11-30 19:23:38
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:22:51
They have said (if you would have read the previous million posts about it) that it's a problem with third party software. Authy is the issue, not Coinbase.
If it's verifying your identity your talking about, that's STILL an issue with third party software. They outsource identity verification to a company that also has clients in banking, credit, employment, etc.
@_date: 2013-11-09 21:42:46
You're an idiot.
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:54:39
Learn to read guy. Stop slandering Coinbase for your own inability to be perceptive to something they made very clear on the "Buy" section of their web page. 
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:38:01
Where are you getting 10 percent, you dingus? It's 1% both ways...
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:36:52
Cool story, but a big indicator of the bubble we are currently in. A lot of people are going to get burned after this trend. Let's just hope some people don't panic sell.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:22:06
Send them an email for support. THIS SUBREDDIT IS NOT FOR COINBASE ISSUES. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:50:59
Awesome. I'll download it and check it out. thanks.
@_date: 2013-11-04 18:06:22
Honestly, as lame and time consuming as this sounds. You can harvest bitcoins by visiting free bitcoin sites and solving the captchas on the page/inserting your wallet address. 
You reap about 4 cents an hour but if you gamble that on satoshi circe you can make A LOT more if you are patient and play it safe. I would see no issue with eventually making a full coin and maybe many more by simply starting with a very small seed and spinning the wheel on satoshi circle.
@_date: 2013-11-23 03:04:51
Don't worry man. I had the same thing happen. Always give ACH transfers at least 5-6 days before letting worry set in. I wish ACH was faster but that's how it goes. Ironically, BTC has a solution for this. We'll see what the future holds ;)
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:55:24
That was a needlessly insensitive and ignorant post.
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:48:19
I think he was pretty reasonable and I sort of agree with him. Bitcoin isn't ready yet. I think we are a year or more off from adoption by a company like Paypal.
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:35:49
Well done! This is really impressive.

"Americans are really fucking stupid and will never be able to understand prefixes (milli, micro.) This makes an $800 bitcoin unusable."
That's your reasoning? Holy shit that is some short sighted ignorant nonsense. Good luck.
@_date: 2013-11-28 21:40:05
And thats precisely why it may not drop too low with the inevitable correction. :)

I pledge to buy one as well. Let's see where BTC goes...

Haha what? You were going to put your savings for your new born daughter into a highly volatile speculative market? You should just save for your daughter.

You sort of sound like a jerk....
The biggest reason you wouldn't move somewhere is by how the women look? Please....

So far, Gyft and SnapCard seem to be the best options. I think I may go with SnapCard. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:57:43
They're a startup, just give them some time. The demand for Bitcoin far outpaces their company's ability to keep up.
Did you send a support request email before posting this drivel?
@_date: 2013-11-15 23:36:53
Go fuck yourself
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:38:03
That is still very easy for the IRS to notice. Never fuck around with tax evasion.
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:39:18
But there are alternatives (litecoin etc.) it's just that they arent widely adopted...
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:22:56
It takes a week to authorize and put coins in your account unless you're verified...
@_date: 2013-10-31 00:30:40
Thanks, that info is very helpful.
Does that mean you can transfer that money over to a wallet/trading platform like Coinbase? Or do people usually have multiple wallets?
@_date: 2013-11-20 19:52:04
little to no growth.
unless they're selling....
@_date: 2013-11-19 06:02:16
Just kill the app and restart it. Something happened when they went down for maintenance. It works fine for me now.
@_date: 2013-11-18 10:00:14
Yeah...no...the senate hearing wont be an issue.

Culture, respect, and the environment...

That news might have been priced in already due to the higher ups having the advantage...

I don't understand the concept of bitcointipbot. How are you guys giving and receiving money with the bot? I'm just starting to learn about Bitcoin and plan on investing in the coming weeks. I very much like the idea of unregulated and reliable currency.
