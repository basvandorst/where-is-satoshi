It's not that hard to send it to the wrong address.  For many possible reasons.  When you're sending $400M you need to be pretty damn sure.

That's not true.

The anti-bitcoin sentiment isn't really a real thing.  The criticism for Bitcoin isn't usually because people hate or want to kill Bitcoin, it's because people genuinely believe it's a bubble and has no fundamental value.  Bitcoin is still small enough that it can be ignored by anyone that doesn't particularly like it.  If it ever gains real adoption there might be some legitimate hate though.

Yeah, people who want to buy a nice graphics card hate crypto, but those are for mining shitcoins, not bitcoin.  
  
But the gamer group is pretty irrelevant compared to the "Banks, Wealthy, Economists, Governments..." as far as having any power goes. And I don't see any real desire to kill bitcoin from those groups.

The buyer is likely an OTC market maker/trader who is buying it intending to dump it on the market as efficiently as possible for a small profit.  "OTC" isn't some magical guy just waiting for someone to sell him 30k bitcoin to HODL.

All the numbers I've seen were significantly less than 60k. What's your source?

The mempool is empty in large part because interest in Bitcoin has declined significantly.  It's a stretch to call it good news when the reasons for it are the opposite of good news.

I don't understand why you guys think massive OTC trades are magical and don't influence the markets at all.  That's not how it works.

Which is why there's more demand for bitcoin.

If he had actually bought it he wouldn't have just forgotten about it.  Mining it when it's worth next to nothing and forgetting about it is way more feasible.

Did I say it was the best answer?
