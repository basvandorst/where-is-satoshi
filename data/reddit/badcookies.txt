Guess you'll have to ignore all those exchanges that list btc&lt;-&gt;usd. Those provide the fair market value for btc. So if you want something and trade 1btc it's worth $600 or whatever the exchange rate at that time is

Doesn't mean they can't patent it, the US changed their laws recently to allow whoever was first to file to get the patent, and anyone with prior art just can't get sued, but also can't invalidate it. So they can still get the patent and anyone new can't create software that uses it, but old software can still exist.

But I'm asking, why would someone new to BTC use it at TD? Because without new people, eventually all the old BTC will "go away" (spent and converted to USD and then kept in cold storage at exchanges) and devalue.
Why would I buy BTC to use it to buy goods?

Right, you are already paying for it but not receiving it when you buy via BTC.

Uhhh... guess you won't expect to receive your items in the mail then?
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:11:02
Sure, but there is no reason for the merchant to sell you the item for less just because you used BTC and they pay less in transaction fees. Just means you get less benefits, and they make more money.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:21:04
Well carrying a balance on a credit card is another issue, but using BTC won't help with people spending more than they can afford to, they'll just take out loans or cash advances.
As far as the credit card option goes, I think all discover cards give 5% back at TD but I'm not sure. Also you'll want to build up your credit if you want to buy a house / car with good rates.
@_date: 2014-03-13 01:37:43
hmm my original reply never showed up.
Its about the perception, if you are quote $100 and have to pay 2% in extra fees, you feel ripped off.
If you get a 2% discount, you feel like you got something special and rewarded.
It doesn't matter to you that they included the 2% fee in your original  quote, but it will matter if they attach it in the end and increase your quoted price.

They just have good timing. I was watching many multi-touch videos from things like TED and tech shows, and they were always talking about how ever year it was getting better and smaller. Apple just had the timing right
Edit: Not sure why I'm getting so many downvotes.
Apple didn't invent any of the technologies they used, they just put them together in a package when the timing was right and performance for size had gotten to where touchscreen phones were possible. They weren't the only company doing this. Their great timing is why they were able to be first out of the gate and able to get a lot of marketshare.

Right, but what is the process, how do they figure it out? How do you know it will be better than PayPal's dispute resolution?
@_date: 2014-03-12 20:10:10
They are only good as long as they can produce BTC quickly, but because new ones come out so quick, and the difficulty raises, their value drops quickly. Thats why if you buy them you might not even recoup your initial investment. I don't see anyone who would sell them used if they could make more by keeping them.
@_date: 2014-03-05 12:43:52
Three whole early adopter issue as well. Those who got in early made a ton and can afford to spend some of their earnings on more mining rigs. Everyone else has very little to gain
It is also a merchant friendly not customer friendly medium. Same "benefits" as sending cash through the internet.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:37:33
Exactly. Scammers will go wherever they can. Btc can't save you from them, if anything it makes them more powerful as bad sellers. If you think escrow services will be free... Good luck.

Did you not read the article I posted? There is a single company that runs the largest farm out there, making up 12,500 BTC per MONTH.
That is over 3,500,000 Gh/s (estimated from their numbers, that would give just over 11,000 BTC per day at current difficulty)
These rigs are in short (limited runs) supply and cost thousands each. Only a few big timers can purchase them and no one else can compete.
If you think pools have anything on these guys you are mistaken. They are the pools. They farm out their hardware for other people to use to mine in pools so they can get up front money instead of trying to cash out the BTC themselves.
They control 1/10 of the total hashrate for bitcoin, and like I said, these powerhouses will only increase because they are the only ones that can buy these limited ASIC miners. Now that GPUs can't be used, the average person is out (and soon with most scrypt miners as well)

Curious how you think it helps you stay away from government when all transactions (by design) are logged forever in public. Once you figure out someone's ID(s) you have full history of their transactions.
Its a great tracking tool by design.
Edit: here is one I found in a few seconds going off recent transactions:
You know exactly when, how much, and to whom (ID) that person has transfered BTC with.
All it takes are enough computers and data (NSA) to link up the IDs with actual people and you can easily get a hierarchy and history.
Hell bust someone and get them to match some names with a few transactions and you have the rest of the ledger out in the open.
So sure, for now its private as long as your address / IDs are unknown, but as soon as they are / governments care enough to "crack" them all of your past history is no longer private.

It seems like a lot if people in here don't understand that you can have all of the protocols and technology from bitcoin without the "bitcoins" currency.

Bitcoin as it is now only allows for the super rich to mine.
That one person / company controls 10% of the market. As mining gets more expensive they will control more and more as regular people can no longer afford to mine and large companies will be the only ones mining.
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:41:56
If I don't share my personal information with the merchant I can't get my goods. If I don't share it with whomever I use to buy the BTC with in the first place I won't have any to spend.
So you can either give it to Visa / Discover / w/e or give it to coinbase.
And if you think the government can't get your data from TigerDirect... uhhh...
Not to mention visa / discover don't know what I bought specifically, just from who and for how much.
The entity that the government is going to get the data from is the merchant, not the payment processor.

I'd actually argue the opposite.
The higher the difficulty, the harder it is for average joe to help.
Instead, you have a handful of super powerful companies / people who control most of the network and you can't take away their power without investing thousands/millions in hardware.
The same reason we need to people to spread out their pool use and issues with ghash back in Jan. Everyone is racing to have more powerful hashing machines that have 0 other value (cpus for general use, gpu for gaming), and 0 resell (who wants to buy it if it no longer makes money &gt; its cost), so unless you go 100% in for mining and have a lot of up front capital to fiance it, you will be replaced by these mega users who will then control everything.
edit: Instead of downvoting, please say why you think I'm wrong. Please explain how a few powerhouses doing all of the hashing is a good thing.

It doesn't enforce accountability at all. Paypal is an escrow service, please explain how Bitcoin escrow services will be so much better.
Saying buyer beware... thats the whole fucking point of Paypal, to protect the buyer from people. Thats why people use escrow services, so they don't get screwed. Don't expect them to be free.
Bitcoin is just cash over the internet, there will have to be services to protect you, and those won't be free.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:31:20
You still need to get the original BTC somehow, and that means buying it (giving away your personal info at some point). And again, its not the payment processor that matters, its the merchant
@_date: 2014-04-24 13:48:12
The point is most merchants that "accept" bitcoin turn it into fiat and never see any of it.
All you are doing is paying most of the transaction fees for them and removing any customer security features from credit/debit cards
@_date: 2014-03-16 04:31:46
Thats why I'm saying I don't think BTC will be the "one coin to rule them all". I'm saying there will be some new coin that works more like Blackcoin, where it is mined and then has POS only.
I'm saying those with the money aren't going to give it up to the lucky ones who got in on BTC at an early stage. If they want the benefits from bitcoin's technology they are going to create a new coin and convert their money into it to give it value.
Think of an official US Coin that replaces the US Dollar for example, everyone trades in their US Dollars at a bank / coin shop or w/e and they get a US Coin in return that is based off bitcoin.
The banks / coin shops (or whatever they will becalled) (and any other business that wants) will have farms to do any of the mining / verifying transactions.

I was reading a post the other week on here about one of the sites that didn't handle 2fa correctly with their API and how people were missing quite a lot of money. Think it might have even been coinbase. I also put "hacked" in quotes because I'm sure many of the sites just took the money / btc and ran.
But yes, always go 2FA and limit risk, the difference is you are still up shit creek if yours get taken vs using a CC with fraud protection or bank/credit union with insured money.

That completely depends on how accounts are setup for the escrow services. If they require you to have an account with them (ratings) they could stop your other transactions (through then) as well. PayPal is an escrow service for fiat and will likely do crypto as well.

You do realize that every bitcoin transaction is pubic record by design right? You can track every place a coin has been. You can create new addresses for every transaction but at some point software will be developed to track trends in spending habits, and at least some transactions will have your name/address tied to them (orders/paying bills/paycheck)

Sure, its easy to spend "free" money ;). But why would someone invest in BTC and spend in the same day, or use it once the price stabilizes?
@_date: 2014-03-14 01:25:46
You expect the escrow service to staff enough people to manually verify every package is in working condition before sending it on?
Not only would you have to pay twice the shipping costs (or even more depending on where its shipping to), but the shipping time would be increased by over double (shipping to them, them testing, them shipping it on).
And you are expecting this for no to little cost?

There have been many BTC sites that are "hacked" and the customers lose everything. Hell I lost a lot when tradehill went down.

@_date: 2014-01-09 05:36:01
The problem with this is the ever changing price in currency for bitcoins. That doesn't work well with delayed payments.
For example:
 You pledge .1 btc worth $100 at the time. .1 Btc drops to $75 by the time the campaign ends.
There are two ways to cash in. When donated or when it ends.
When you donate: They get $100 if successful, you get $100 back, or .1 btc worth $75. If the price raised however you'd only get $100 back or less than .1 btc that you put in.
When it ends: They only get $75 if the campaign is successful and you get your .1 btc back if it fails
The "cash" when donated is the only way to make sure the funding level gets met correctly but could result in getting less btc back if the funding fails.

I've been "hit" by Sony's PS3 hack and Targets and haven't had to do anything and never had a charge or do anything except change the expiration date / security code on amazon. CCs are covered for theft protection and allow you to charge back if the seller tries to screw you. 
I'm covered if someone steals my wallet. What protections do you have if someone gets a hold of your wallet?
I also get 1% -&gt; 10% cash back on every purchase instead of paying something like coinbase 1%.

I grew up watching bitcoin go up and down.
First I got my wallet stolen, then the value went to $900 after I sold at $300. Then I bought at $900 and the value plummeted to $300. Then I watched millions lose their coins at Mt Gox.

Please do explain how btc is the solution to people spending more than they can afford or for purchases that need to be made outside of their budget (health, food, etc)
Also I never said my situation mirrors everyone. I said I think that all Discover cards give 5% CB at TigerDirect, and the common benefits to CCs are mostly common between all types of cards (charge back, theft prevention, etc) and others like warranty or even 1-2% CB or Miles or w/e are very common.
As long as someone pays off their card(s) every month they can make quite a bit back in rewards just for buying what they would have otherwise.

Thanks for the downvote. Look at the effort people used to try and track down the Mt Gox missing coins.
At some point software will be developed to automate that tracking. There will be a lot of money put towards it by governments and private sectors.
How do you think your bitcoin paycheck will look? Do you expect your employer to create a new address for every payment they send to you, and ask you for a new address each paycheck? And do you want to get multiple small payments so its easier to remix? Do you want to spend that effort every time you buy something?
You do realize that most actions you take are tracked already right? Bitcoin just makes transactions visible to anyone / everyone by default.
And like I said, many transactions will already have proof of ownership. Your paystubs, anything you order online (if you expect it to arrive), anything you do in person and any bills you pay or anything else you'd do with any other current that ties back to you.

What if his excel file shows green for positive
@_date: 2014-01-26 18:53:12
Does anyone get paid in BTC or do you just mean through mining? I don't see anyone converting their paycheck until the price stabilizes.
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:01:13
It would be like you just paid directly with USD but using btc as the secondary payment system (coinbase the primary).
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:46:07
Which is why it won't happen. If a bitcoin based currency does replace cash it will probably have no new mining involved and be closer to a direct replacement for cash.
@_date: 2014-03-11 03:07:30
Paypal / credit card charge back and more customer friendly services. Sadly bitcoin is more seller friendly without using a third party like PayPal that people hate.
@_date: 2014-03-29 13:48:16
Most exchanges charge you conversion fees, fees to withdraw, fees to deposit. There are no physical locations nor physical money they need to provide for you and customer support is usually just an email address or contact form
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:24:09
Besides not having to have massive amounts of physical money on hand, its also for customer protection. They don't want someone whose Debit card is stolen to have their bank account wiped out (and then either have that person screwed, or have to repay them out of pocket). Its much easier to eat $300 -&gt; $5000 then $20k / whatever their bank account held.
It also helps with blackmailing / forcing someone to close / withdraw most of their account because they can only get $5k max, so it reduces risk/reward benefit.
How many people have had their whole BTC wallet lost/stolen with no way to get anything back?
@_date: 2014-01-26 17:47:30
So you are paying an extra 1% fee and getting no benefits (from OP) in return correct?
Credit cards are covered for bad charges, theft, etc. But there is no such protection for BTC, you have to do it all yourself, and if something happens (computer hacked, paper wallets lost, etc) you are SOL.
Its basically just digital cash / check.
What happens if someone hacks coinbase (or your account) and transfers / buys a bunch of BTC? What protections do you have?
@_date: 2014-04-26 15:37:41
All that proves if they closed your account. No mention of bitcoin or coinbase
@_date: 2014-03-16 06:04:14
Because it would give a 1-&gt;1 exchange for your current wealth, but give you the benefits from bitcoin. Or are you saying the only benefits of bitcoin is that it is a money maker?
What about the blockchain, and the transparency, and the ease of use / ability to transfer money to people anywhere.
And I'm saying if its going to happen, it could be one coin that the world agrees to, or multiple like we have now, but I don't think those with the money are going to give it up to the early adopters of the technology. The tech itself is great, but I don't see BTC being the end game coin.
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:17:11
I get that (should have noted that in my OP). But since TD isn't even using BTC on there side, its more like an alternative to Paypal (payment processor) than an alternative currency.
@_date: 2014-01-09 02:40:04
It's one of their options yes. Read my other reply for more info
@_date: 2014-05-01 02:25:12
In bitcoin terms:
Charge back = Pre ordering ASIC that never ship and getting your btc back.
Fraud protection = getting your btc back after having your wallet stolen and coins transferred out
@_date: 2014-05-17 15:31:45
And just like 99% of the flavors of Linux they are useless except for a few people that like it.
I don't believe the final coin(s) have been released that mass adoption will use. Bitcoin is the early man's coin and it's value is held up by the massive costs of the hardware to run it.
There is still a lot to learn and new features to be added.
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:27:52
Fine, say $500 and $1200 and $500 then, whatever. My point was everything in this "great quote" has happened with BTC in the last 3 months.
@_date: 2014-05-11 21:47:55
Mining is separate **now**, it used to be one in the same. Asics and pooled mining were not part of the original design and goal
@_date: 2014-04-15 00:28:54
And you don't think they can't force you to send them your btc for holding?
@_date: 2014-01-27 02:30:04
I'm not sure if you are serious, but if so that was definitely not my intention.
I think BTC in itself is good, I just think using it more for a payment processor (converting directly to USD) has many flaws and doesn't really even support the adoption of BTC.
@_date: 2014-03-14 19:31:55
I don't see any information about this on their website(s)

I'm talking about ASICs. GPUs at least have resell value (for their intended purpose of gaming). ASIC miners don't because they are either fast enough to make you money, or they aren't. There is no fall back purpose for them.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:26:47
You are saying you don't pay attention to your accounts?
You don't check to make sure you have the right about of BTC in your wallet?
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:10:18


I'm confused, what is there to force / encourage the merchant to deliver the goods? With CCs there are charge backs but with BTC (currently) there is no way to get your money back once sent. Thats how people are being scammed when doing exchanges including local btc.
@_date: 2014-01-26 19:21:59
No I get that, I'm just wondering if there is any immediate benefit.
How can we get more people to use BTC if only those who made money buying/mining early get anything out of it.
There needs to be a reason for people to buy into BTC (besides the potential investment)
@_date: 2014-05-18 15:01:01
PayPal offers a lot more **customer** features such as dispute resolution.
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:37:43
They aren't asic resistant  themselves. No one has created a chip yet
@_date: 2014-01-16 16:50:40
What? First, the dollar doesn't fluctuate nearly as much as BTC. Second, you'd get the exact same back.
The difference between the two scenarios is in my example you are converting BTC -&gt; USD and in your example there is no conversion at all.
@_date: 2014-03-30 14:07:32
Except the difficultly can't drop too far or it would be easy for the large farms to gain complete control of the network. Bitcoin will become centralized
@_date: 2014-03-15 03:22:15
There is still at least one post in this subreddit a week about overstock.com giving them free advertisement
@_date: 2014-05-19 16:38:43
Right, and there will be many different companies (as long as its profitable for them) that will offer these services. But they are going to have to charge fees if you expect any kind of customer service from them if something does go wrong.
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:50:21
And with btc the seller has the control instead. It is just sending cash over the internet. They can send you a rock and provide tracking info for escrow service (which week charge fees like PayPal)
People think PayPal is something's special, it is basically the escrow service everyone is preaching will save them for btc. If you don't think they will be one of the first BTC escrow services out there you'd be wrong.
There is never a way to trust someone completely which is why services like Paypal exist. Scammers use whatever they can you get / keep goods and take /keep your money.
If you think escrow services for btc will be free, don't expect them to do jack shit to resolve your claim or you'll pay a lot for it. The reason they charge everyone fees is the same way insurance works, everyone pays a little so those that have to use it don't get charged much. If you have to pay $100 for them to have someone investigate what happened with your shipment and why you got a rock and verify that's what happened no one would use it.
@_date: 2014-03-14 20:07:03
And again, I'm not talking specific numbers, I'm talking about everything he was trying to point out as failures in fiat have *all happened in the last 3 months alone with btc*
@_date: 2014-05-13 03:28:46
How so? Someone is going to spend a few hours researching it only to find out they only got 4 cents and most of it will go to tx fees
@_date: 2014-01-26 22:12:47
It was (20+ years ago) simple for me when I opened my first bank account at a local credit union. If you have a job I doubt you'd have a hard time getting a simple credit card as well.
I'd always recommend using a credit card over debt for the protection (if someone jacks your debit card you are out cash instead of credit until its resolved). Just never spend over what you could pay with cash so you don't end up in debt.
@_date: 2014-01-09 05:38:16
Not sure why my other replies to this aren't showing up but I think the flex option is a scam. They want to take any money donated without providing a product (since they don't have the funds to make it)
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:23:11
Oh I know, and someone else just made a similar comment.
I think the 5% back from TD is standard from Discover, but not sure (its through ShopDiscover).
People need to figure out how to budget for sure, and I wouldn't suggest BTC for anyone who wasn't already good with money :)
@_date: 2014-05-02 01:03:43
They could just force you to transfer them

Can't wait for all the "Windows is so insecure!!" Posts, yet this would happen the same if written to look for the paths in linux as well...
Any machine is insecure if **you** install / run untrusted software on it. Don't install random software, especially not from known hackers.
@_date: 2014-03-21 07:22:06
If only bitcoin had some kind of public ledger to track transactions it would be so much easier to find where the coins went and when...
@_date: 2014-05-24 14:45:36
Bitcoins solve all problems
@_date: 2014-03-14 17:19:16
How do you provide proof? Thats the point.
Who is going to manually check these disputes to verify if X sent a rock, or Y is just saying they received one but really received the goods?
They aren't going to do that for 0% fee, because they'd have to pay people to do work.
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:43:14
How would this work? They usually don't take payment until the funding time is up and then only if it gets the funding required. 
They'd either have to take your funds up front and then repay or constantly recalculate the exchange rates for bitcoins and this the funding level... Plus how would they then request the funds from you?
@_date: 2014-05-25 02:18:57
There is no innovation. These machines are nothing more than paperweights once they no longer provide returns larger than costs. They don't help anything except exclude people who can't afford them from mining. They make it a rich man's club instead of something for all people like how bitcoin was designed. The network is much less secure now than it was when it was cpu mined because the power is in the hands of a few people
@_date: 2014-03-13 19:51:31
And how do you resolve disputes with btc for free exactly?
@_date: 2012-09-05 21:32:12

The card adds about 10 watts idle and 180 when used
You also have to take into account getting rid of the heat (70-80c), which means fans or AC.
Also with 11.7 or 11.8 drivers cpu will run at 100% of one core
@_date: 2011-08-20 00:47:18
I'm just saying its heating up the surrounding area so you have to take into account more than just the card / computer costs. If you have it in the basement or garage or something the heat won't be an issue, but if you live in a hot area or have the computer around people the 150+ degree temps coming out will warm the place up.
@_date: 2011-08-18 03:41:10
At that rate, you are spending more in electricity than making
@_date: 2011-08-07 05:40:00
The exchange rate is pretty poor ($7.6253) but it looks like a cool site, thanks for the heads up :)
