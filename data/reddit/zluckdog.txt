I think what they want is a sizable list of people in a similar situation: taxpayers who 'may have' used crypto within the past year and not reporting short term profit.
That way they can send pretty much a template copy of the same letter to those people asking to report any such profits. A scared subset of those people will try and make payments. 
The cost of getting the list and the potential payoff might be worth it for them, since the IRS has less funding per the article linked. Or maybe just use this information to add in some research paper estimating the number of crypto users based on wallets per phone out of the total phone users.

@_date: 2018-09-01 04:22:51
simple: 
* the longest chain with the most work devoted is bitcoin, no matter what &lt;-- satoshi repeatedly stressed this point
* bitmain added a backdoor to their miner (my guess was to be used as a last resort to block protocol changes, ie: segwit)
* bch has inferior coding review practices and so did implementations prior to the fork
* bch is driven by marketing, not free market forces (reminds me of paycoin)
* the demand for full block space was temporary,  a dynamic blocksize would be best. do we need multi-meg sized blocks right now? (nope, only during FOMO bubbles)
* the fork is about control. as the minority fork, bch is much more centralized.
* the market &amp; network decided. &lt;-- a big reason (and almost everyone went along with it)

I have read this here many times. 
Sure, buying off exchange at a discounted rate &amp; selling on exchange with or without leverage, can be profitable.
But that does not describe the market action as a whole.
Consider the majority of traders are not Americans or Europeans, they are Chinese &amp; currently the majority of those eyes (and RMB fiat) are looking at [this bubble]( and are choosing to spend their money wisely. When the Chinese market pops, they will be taking their profit &amp; putting it into other things, potentially bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-06-03 22:45:42
So they just transfer some BTC to an exchange in supported country &amp; then deposit to recipients bank account.

MtGox getting bank accounts shut down due to silk road investigation is an example on how terrorism funding via a public ledger would likely play out.
Most exchanges have a reduced number of banking partners willing to 'risk' a business relationship. If the US Govt finds evidence of transactions associated with terrorism, they would likely subpoena &amp; gag order the bank of the exchange where the funds ended up. Then they would know who is getting the fiat. They would shadow the person &amp; find who they associate with, shadow those people. It would actually help their investigation rather then hinder it.

that's not the way I look at it.
I see a potential bug, full mempools on nodes, should have code for that case. If you trace back the conditions for such a scenario, you come to a conclusion an increase in max block size would need to be made. But that opens up another potential problem. So the code should be made to address this in a long term way.

Not enough space to make up for 12.5BTC. The max block size would have to increase &amp; the space would have to get filled by TX w fees. 
If spot price does not rise, miners are going to feel the hurt. I guess it would become a combination of a drop in the number of miners &amp; their hashing power plus an increase in spot price for the limiting supply.

They are smart &amp; are in a more favorable regulatory zone. They can bribe the right people and stay in business. They can offer products that Western exchanges can't. They can fluff their volume and all this will attract the most amount of traders. They can see what bets people make &amp; exploit that data.

I have been to China twice in the past 5 years. Both times when I was there, I saw lots of new construction happening &amp; LOTS of people. I equate China's housing market to USA's 2005 period. There is a bubble there that is going to burst. Same as the stock market.
It would be wrong to simply say "more people, more cash, more traders" but that is effectively the point I am trying make.
But, you are right, I can't back up my claims. I can't use the rationale "Look at Chinese exchange volume" because of recent revelations/confirmation of fake volume on one 'leading' exchange.
So I considered, in what country are the majority of bitcoins being mined &amp; what exchanges are they sold on (which is volume that can't be faked, since they need to pay their power bill). 
Trying to find some info on hashing by country, every link turned out to be old data. Nothing I could use to prove China has the most mining. The data did show China growing in hash power.
I can say, there is a lack of volume on most western exchanges. Part of the problem is a lack of leverage available on these exchanges. That is one reason OKcasino gathered market share.

Thought that Bitfinex located/managed in China/HK, right?


Are you saying the exchange owners purposefully manipulate the market to exploit western traders?
I think there is a position of power to be a top exchange. That motivates faking some volume to attract traders. 
But think it through:
* Traders deposit coin (easiest way into an exchange) 
* Exchanges P&amp;D collecting said coins
* Exchanges have to pay bills &amp; spend money on their plastic surgery mistress, so they need to sell those coins.
They would need people paying RMB (CNY) for those coins they swindled out of traders, so they must have a buyer with fiat. Were are those people?
Best answer is: there are enough Chinese traders with cash to play with.

[Facebook does not know your password]( it does not save your password anywhere. When you log in, you are not sending them your password.
You are [hashing]( your password on your local machine and sending the hash. They throw the hash value through a function and it tells them Y/N if you typed in the right password.
Keeping *your* password on their server is bad. It can &amp; will be stolen. (this was the way it was it used to be)
Traditional payment systems are necessarily keeping your private information on their system. That is how they work. They need to keep your private info (account credit card exp date, birth-date, etc) for their system to work. 
You make a payment at a store, that store keeps enough information to carry out the payment with your bank or card issuer. With this method, your private info is kept in many places. All it takes is Target, Home Depot, JPmChase, etc getting hacked &amp; your private information stolen.
Bitcoin avoids all that. It is a fundamental difference in design. It still allows unrestricted access.

Yes, this is good. Why? Politicians who accept Bitcoin donations might be more inclined to pass laws that are beneficial to the Bitcoin economy, increasing the market price, which in turns makes those donations they received increase in value.
a potential "Feedback loop". 
They might also 'sell' those coins to fund the campaign which will add some selling pressure, but of course the market moves more on news and sentiment, election season is all about fundraising and this will bring more and more news as candidates talk about new fundraising techniques.

It might happen like this:
Dollar is crashing, people with USD balance on trading exchanges all try to convert USD to BTC. At the same time, less and less people try to 'short' (sell BTC waiting for a drop in price to buy up more BTC)
Rising price of BTC as there is more demand, less supply. 
Flip side:
BTC does have some link to USD price as many people buy BTC with their extra money. People having less and less of that spending money will spend on things they absolutely need instead of buying BTC.
Decreasing demand in the mid to long term.

Utilizing the bitcoin network as a BBS/forum, anyone can send coins to a designated address (FORUM OWNED ADDRESS), along with a message. 
Open source code will simply return the coins, minus the network fee (or even a small support/donation fee) back to the sending address 
and place the text/memo into the forum, including coin value next to the forum's text. The sender always gets the coins returned, less a
miner's fee &amp; forum support fee.

I think this has been asked/discussed a few times now. You can try and hide source of coins but consider that bitcoin protocol is a 'public record', you are trying to do something that is contrary to the very nature of the system.
Other people have suggested using coinfog but lately people have posted about it selectively scamming users.
Other people have suggested instead to send coins through multiple exchanges. This might not be the best idea as, with MtGox being under investigation, no doubt stemming from SilkRoad coins being traced to there. If you were to use an exchange that later gets it's records sent/taken to FBI/IRS then you risk being investigated.
But consider this: say you are successful in moving money through [whatever process] and then back to yourself, you would still want to get some USD. Years of AML laws have made no easy way to do this &amp; any idea you think up, has already been tried before.
Bottom line: You are asking the wrong people. Go ask a banker how they launder their own money, they are the experts, they have years of experience.

hate to be seen as a downer but.. current lawsuits and legal actions against mtgox would hinder this from the get-go. plus if gox was doing anything naughty before "it all came crashing down" they would rather seek bankruptcy protection then give out any details that could come back to bite.
bottom line: any chance of a recovery plan like this hatching would be through mtgox and the heads of the company.

based on the info provided by the news articles &amp; that company's site, they store gold &amp; silver in an independent third party vault. They also deliver bars of gold/silver.
But this new altcoin is backed by only 100 grams of gold. which is only ~ $4,200
Divide that by 10 million coins and ..... yeah each one is not worth much. They would need to up the backing to something like 100,000 grams of gold to really be worth anything. And would have to get other gold companies to accept those coins in exchange for gold (not easy in my mind).

But there will be a transition period. some of the new, some of the old way of thinking.
That dynamic needs a 'Carrot &amp; stick' method. Those that cozy up to big money need to fear doing so. Seeing examples: other politicians loosing their elected jobs. Being unelected is the greatest fear.
That fear can breed a culture of championing the methods you describe, just as a way to keep in power.

Virtual currency activities outside of the covered activities described above are not covered by the policy statement or by the regulatory requirements discussed in this document. In particular, this policy statement is not intended to cover the merchants and consumers who
use virtual currencies solely for the purchase or sale of goods or services. Further, the policy statement is not intended to cover activities that are not financial in nature but utilize technologies similar to those used by digital currency. For example, a cryptography-based distributed ledger system for non-financial record keeping would be outside the scope of this policy.

It is traceable for all.
Large organizations, use a bitcoin exchange for example, receive large/many deposits from many people. People like to lust over large amounts of money/bitcoin. Once the public is informed of an address under the control of that organization, anyone is able to see where the funds move.
For a person like you or me, only the people that send/receive bitcoin from us, can link us to our addresses. This info is not something that people really care to tell the public about &amp; the public is not interested in knowing.

Explaining the workings of bitcoin alone is great. It has been done before. Explaining bitcoin without the context of modern markets &amp; commerce built on internet usage, utilizing pre-internet payment systems, then you really have not explained the 'why'.
Explaining to someone, when purchasing online goods, you give away a full name, home address, credit card number, exp date, code on the back, all of this enables theft &amp; to trust in their security (Target gets hacked). This is giving away access to your account.
With bitcoin you authorize &amp; sign a transaction that can't changed or be used to get access to the rest of your assets. And instead you allow the whole world to see that transaction &amp; what other transactions are linked to that address. But you don't give away access!

That speech came to mind when I was reposting this wiki page. 
"   A vital element in keeping the peace is our military establishment. Our arms must be mighty, ready for instant action, so that no potential aggressor may be tempted to risk his own destruction...
    This conjunction of an immense military establishment and a large arms industry is new in the American experience. The total influence — economic, political, even spiritual — is felt in every city, every statehouse, every office of the federal government. We recognize the imperative need for this development. Yet we must not fail to comprehend its grave implications. Our toil, resources and livelihood are all involved; so is the very structure of our society. In the councils of government, we must guard against the acquisition of unwarranted influence, whether sought or unsought, by the military–industrial complex. The potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists, and will persist. We must never let the weight of this combination endanger our liberties or democratic processes. We should take nothing for granted. Only an alert and knowledgeable citizenry can compel the proper meshing of the huge industrial and military machinery of defense with our peaceful methods and goals so that security and liberty may prosper together.

No one here thinks paypal is a hero, those are your words not mine. What I am saying is this move gives legitimacy to bitcoin in the eyes of paypal users. 
Paypal integrating bitcoin into their system is completely unexpected. I thought they would fight till the bitter end. This opens up paypal's market share to bitcoin, which is a big deal.

Best option is to quit gambling, now that you made money. Take that money off the site, put it in cold storage and sit on it for a few years and see what it brings.
If you want to spend it, go book a flight to Vegas, go to a casino that accepts bitcoin and have a fun weekend. Maybe you will win more, but for sure you will have a good time and a story to tell.
But you wont do that. You will go back to that site, deposit some, gamble again, loose it, deposit more to 'revenge gamble' and loose it all and maybe loose even more.
The choice is yours.

* Private Keys are used to create the signature for transactions (or messages) are never revealed.
* Public Keys are not revealed until you spend bitcoin (sign a message or transaction). 
* Addresses that we see holding bitcoin are actually a hash of the Public Key.

The obvious question is jurisdiction, both of which country we are discussing and specifically what governing body should regulate these businesses &amp; I will assume we are discussing US.
In my opinion, business regulation should be left to the states in which they reside. This will have the same effect of business migrating to the most favorable district, as they do already, the same as international businesses migrate to which country gives them the best opportunity. 
For actual regulations, we should take a look at what we are trying to [prevent]( which is the [scammers]( while at the same time promote [innovation](

RV owns bitcoin.com, has a simple contract with OK for them to use the domain. OK gets to design and resell advertisements on the site but must pay a minimum 10k per month.
OK starts out paying but then stops paying. First they promise the payment will soon. Soon turns a week, then to a month. Each time saying payment is on the way. 
Then OK claims the problem is USA govt is scary and does not want them to conduct business with RV and asks to pay to someone other then RV in order to hide the fact they are paying RV (illegal money laundering). RV refuses. RV asks to just be payed in BTC. Payment is not made.
Then OK claims another contract was signed but that was later proved to be altered &amp; even the language in the forged/fake contract did not release them from their payment obligation.
OK then claims their company name is just a brand name &amp; is therefore unable to be part of any contract, which to them, releases any responsibility in paying.
Social Media war starts.
Instead of paying the owed amount to RV, OK decides to pay someone to 'prove' the fake contract.

True, it wont necessarily directly boost USD/BTC exchange rates. But I assume most altcoin exchanges only do ALT to BTC. If a lot of people at once are trying to pull BTC out of an altcoin exchange, that smaller exchange may have to go to a larger exchange (bitstamp) and replenish their BTC wallet. 
But that is a few too many IF/AND/OR/BUTs to be reliable for financial decisions.

Sold a toy for x amount of bitcoin which was put into escrow. Toy was delivered and escrow was released to you.
During that time the bitcoin was in escrow the price changed.
Price of toy was USD/fiat equivalent in bitcoin. Received was the same amount of bitcoin but now that bitcoin is worth more/less in terms of USD.
That sounds like a capital gain/loss *if* you were to liquidate the bitcoin at that moment. But if you kept the bitcoin as bitcoin, you have not realized the gain/loss.

consider an expensive painting. during economic stability, worth thousands of dollars. during economic depression, worth far fewer dollars because many more people are 'tightening their budgets' and not splurging on these things. also many more people are selling their art to make up for other losses of income.
This will only hold true for bitcoin if:
during economic downturns less people 'buy' bitcoin &amp; more people 'sell' bitcoin.
But this is not as simple as it would be as there is less 'use' for a painting than there is with bitcoin. bitcoin facilitates economic progress &amp; allows commerce. it has been boosted by speculation (buy/sell in the hopes of profit). during an economic downturn: those that have the funds, know that a market cycles, will plan accordingly.

So this part, decentral vs central, goes against conventional wisdom &amp; is not understood by people who hear the terms thrown around.
Instead of idealogical talking points, I will explain it as such:
Central systems that would function to keep a financial database/ledger updated &amp; secure have profit, overhead costs. Decentralized bitcoin replaces the overhead costs with a competitive "free market" for confirming transactions. By externalizing the cost of keeping the ledger updated, Bitcoin can compete on a cost level unobtainable by conventional central methods.

I don't think it means what you think it means.
It means:  Anything that can go wrong, will go wrong
What you are trying to say is that low fee/no fee COULD allow people to trade more and incur less fees. With that they might trade into themselves to make it appear as market movement.
Can you separate that out from the normal volume?

With my questions I am leading you to the point I am trying to make, consensus is hard &amp; even harder when it is among rivals.
Intrinsic value of bitcoin is that it can be used for more then just a form of money. I know direct OAP use is not going to increase *spot* price of bitcoin. It does increase exposure, though.

No. This is not right. A person could earn $100 working for 1 hour while another person earns $100 working 8 hours. This does not mean the first person is 'doing more honest work'. 
So if the first person, works the full 8 hours, earning $800, they earned more but that does not mean they did more honest work, it just means they have greater income. It does not compel them to donate or to do good deeds. That depends on the character traits of the individual. 
Honesty is independent of work. Honesty is a personal characteristic &amp; is not dependent on income. It depends on the person, not on the paycheck they receive.

Reasonable answer but trying to find a less than 1mb agreement would be even harder than what is attempted right now.
If there is a foreseeable need for an increase, even if it is years away, why not start to include it in code in a fashion that allows it to happen per those conditions. 
Say something major happens where demand unpredictably increases beyond capacity or a LN or SW problem arises that moves traffic back to on-chain or back to within maxblocksize, it would be great to be robust to handle that situation. If that never happens, no loss, it is there ready for the inevitable increase. 
Say all goes well and LN takes off and worldwide adoption attempts to increase to VISA-like levels, the rush to agree on a new max/code it up/test/roll out .. would be hectic.

Price of bitcoin, for the most part, is independent of usage &amp; adoption.
Speculation drives the market price. Investors &amp; day traders are not necessarily computer science geeks. For them it is easier to speculate on stocks, futures &amp; currencies then it is to link up a bank account to a relatively new company in order to purchase an asset they then have research how to properly secure.
An ETF would allow easier access for speculators.

I get they are restricting cash. I get it.
But they make no mention of bitcoin, that is my point. Im sure if asked directly, they would add, "no bitcoin withdrawls over 1k eruo value, or whatever".
But a blogger takes what a news site said about restricting cash, then he adds/jumps to conclusion: bbitcoin is restricted too.

agreement with the Gemini Exchange with respect to trading of the bitcoin asset underlying the
Trust and that the Gemini Exchange is supervised by the NYSDFS


sufficient**, because the Gemini Exchange conducts only a small fraction of the worldwide trading
in bitcoin, and because the Gemini Exchange is not a “regulated market” comparable to a
national securities exchange or to the futures exchanges that are associated with the underlying
assets of the commodity-trust ETPs approved to date.

You state things in a way to dismiss others and you do it in a rude way. This appears to be done on purpose to drag the conversation away from the discussion topics. It is also a way you avoid having to elaborate, support or defend your statements.
 
Fixing problems is good.
the "bad" blockchain split was when version 0.8 nodes accepted a block as valid, while nodes 0.7 &amp; older rejected.
the "good" blockchain split eventually, with a patch version 0.8.1, the main chain continued without that block.
Although some miners did loose money(bad), as the blocks they mined after the split became invalid, the positive(good) part was software gets fixed. [Problem was solved and we are still here.](
Another 'good' split would be the fork fixing [the chain after block 74638.](

This question would be better to post in the [rBitcoinmarkets daily altcoin discussion thread]( since it is more/less a trading related question.
at the only posts that make it to the front page are those that promote BCH and they won't allow (collectively) anything that goes counter to that. example "Should I sell all my BCH for bitcoin?"
in you won't get much encouragement for the bitcoin to BCH related idea, for the same reasons. 
My opinion: if you are going to trade BTC for BCH .. consider the conversion rates will likely eat any potential profit (unless you time the market perfectly) It would be better to just buy whichever currency you want rather than converting, unless you feel that currency is 'dooomed'
As someone who has been around for a long while (compared to most people here) I would say stay with bitcoin. Those FOMO feelings are not going to earn you any profits.

Bitcoin is naturally hard to adopt changes, it would likely be resistant to implementing KYC/AML at the protocol level.

r/bitcoin used to be almost un-moderated and things were fine. people would just downvote trolls and move on. almost no one had their comments removed, no matter what they said. I even remember several front page posts with warnings about how theymos has control of all the most popular forums. no mod had to remove those posts, there was no need to. at that time, I thought those posters were crazy or just had some personal grudge. then came the rule changes &amp; 'It's time for a break:' thread. 
things changed. this forum was just not pleasant to read when threads are organized by controversial or multiple comments deleted/removed and now it seems artificially anti-[select group of people] as the most upvoted responses. same with r/btc when the top responses/postings are just anti-[person or group]. it's just not appealing.
I really don't like what this has become.
This is like people having an argument and just yelling at each other. Yelling louder is not winning a debate. Silencing someone is not winning a debate. A yelling match is not a debate. No one will hear the other side when both sides are yelling. 
this is an infinite loop.

the scaling debate held the market down due to uncertainty. once segwit activated on litecoin and it was clear no adverse issue popped up, the activation on bitcoin became likely.

Some quick calculation:
* $200 million / 7 days = $28,571,428
 
* 144 blocks mined per day (average) X 12.5(per block reward) = 1,800 Bitcoin per day of supply
If this money was just used to purchase the current produced supply, the cost per bitcoin would be $15,873 per 1 btc.
But bitcoin dominance is roughly 69%, so instead of the low end $200 million we should do 69% if $200 mil .. lets try this again:
* 69% of $200 million = $138 million
* $138 million / 7 days = $19,714,286 per day
* $19,714,286 / 1,800 btc = $10,952 per bitcoin
Remember this is a low end range.

I happened to find a mobile phone shop that was signed up. I think I was their first customer, but I did it early on so they kept it going and when I checked back like a year later they said other people had used it too.
They still have it going and last time I used it was maybe about 6 months ago or more. It works fine but the fee though is super high (compared to like coinbase)
I walked in and asked the first time. It was the owner that set it up so if you get a typical employee type clerk, they might not know what it is or have access (I think LibertyX forces the vendor use 2factor auth to transact)
@_date: 2019-06-11 17:34:42
I used one. I think the first time you do it might have some issues if you don't have a copy of your passport/driver lic and a face/selfi photo saved on your phone or desktop. 
I tried to redeme while in the store (without wifi connection and less than 3 bars) and it took FOREVER (my fault for no wifi and uploading a 1.2mb photo) and eventually told me "Contact Support"
The support gal was super helpful though. Eventually I used a desktop computer to go through the KYC and it worked.
One thing they should change:
The interface should display the "pending" sale in the dashboard. Instead it only displays the pending transaction when they move it to your account/wallet. 
So for a while after passing the KYC and account setup it will say your balance is 0.00 for a long time and it won't display the pending purchase until it moves into your account. But after I checked back later it was deposited.
High fee but lower fee than LibertyX (which I have also used locally but my storefront charged 8% but had a better spot price though.)

To say China's govt or army or whatever is dangerous because of things they did in the past, while ignoring things the US govt has done, is playing favorites.
Both have done bad things to the people. The point of bitcoin is to free us up. If you want a protocol change to limit one countries involvement, you must realize how it will impact all the other countries. Consider 3rd world countries, how will they be able to compete with such a bandwidth limiting change?
Doing anything to segregate a select group of people is morally wrong.

You and I know the reason they don't allow unlimited size blocks is because one miner could set up an farm capable of of making big enough blocks that will fill up/take longer to confirm by other nodes to push them (and miners) off the network.

Are those people with less than fifty bucks securing the network against attacks?


Separate the fact from the opinion. Fact: "50 us dollar fees makes everyone with less than 50 us dollars worth of bitcoin a hard time transacting."
Your Opinion: "The network became permanently centralized due to the fee crisis and those who (in your opinion) are rich"
My opinion is the fee crisis is a temporary condition due to the market. The network did not centralize because fees, performance as a function of small commerce was diminished only temporarily. Commerce, though one of the primary purposes of bitcoin, has always taken a backseat to speculation when it comes to market prices AND security.
That was 2017 and we are in 2019 now, the system is still running and has SUPERIOR security to all other available competitors.
* Even with the easy opportunity for everyone to switch to a big block chain, the vast majority chose not to. Not because of some centralized effort, but because collectively the safest course in bitcoin is to always follow the longest valid chain. Those that chose this position, prospered.

Those are your choices. It honestly shows a lack of maturity or naivety of social dynamics. It is within your bounds to understand and change, to have a better impact from your words.
Using ASICBOOST, I am reasonably certain they are. It is coded, implemented and available on the chips .. no doubts here. And for sure the exploit is bad for bitcoin. not the most pressing issue, but certainly not something that should be ignored.
So why not focus on that real problem?
Instead the OP (or is this you? Idk) chooses to chase the Bigger/smaller block narrative and attack a person. Divisive and wrongly focused on size of blocks.
But as per the "Empty blocks to harm the network, etc" that part isn't accurate.  I remember way back before ASICboost .. blocksize .. all that, the question of nearly empty blocks came up.  The idea is to try to cement the block recently found by yourself (or the chain you are working on) and doing a nearly empty block was the way it was typically done.
Instead this tactic is being framed as a political divisive narrative.

**your explanation for the data you are seeing is formed from your bias and not from experience or understanding.**
Mining a nearly empty block, after finding a successful normal block, is not uncommon.
The purpose is to mitigate the potential for your successful normal block to be orphaned when another miner builds on a different block.


@_date: 2017-09-19 22:55:50


Do you wonder why would they(or any other) do that?! TO PILE ON THE CHAIN THEY ARE MAKING!
If they can find another block, they reduce their chance of the previous one getting orphaned! 
It is pretty common sense. When I repeat it, you instead want to get sassy and insult, as a way to deflect.


Just be kind.
@_date: 2017-09-19 23:42:17


it is still possible. But looking at 2 pieces of data, when thousands are available, and making a logic jump from that ... that is bullshit.


it takes time for a miner to figure out which transactions are in a block and validate those transactions. If the rest of the network is having to validate the previous block’s transactions and remove them from their mempool and then form up a new block to process, there is an opportunity to get a head start by mining a nearly empty block. It also cements your block into the chain, preventing the possibility of being orphaned, which CAN still happen.
If you already started a new race with the empty .. why quit and start over?

You made a post about trading digital goods via paypal. Most responses are hinting at the possibility of charge-backs, which is the risk when selling digital goods over the internet.
The top upvoted response links to a thread about [...the most current safe methods by which to convert your Dota 2 (or any Steam-tradable) items for cash over Paypal, Western Union, Bank Transfer, or **Bitcoin**.]( 
That response included a section about bitcoin.
Did you not read that? I will paste it here:


This answers your gripe with bitcoin ["Give me some legitimate reasons to use bitcoin for payments instead of just debit card... where is bitcoin better and the other is not? I pay everything incl bills, food, etc, in my country with debit card and there is no comission for any of the transactions. It just takes a swipe to pay with contactless, or 30 sec to pay online. "](
But the part about "no comission for any of the transactions" is incorrect. The person providing/accepting CC or debit card has to pay the fees (percent of transaction plus a flat rate) for using the system. They build the fee into all retail items (some specifically tell you, if you pay with Credit or debit, the fee is $X.XX extra)
The other danger with using your debit card is: once the card information is stolen, a thief can take your money. The process for replacing a card, though 'free' is actually a headache (been hit more than once).
Also, now you have to trust multiple people to safegard your identity (name and address) and your card  security code &amp; expiration date.
The fewer people who have that information, the safer you are.

Social Security is a system where new workers, currently on payroll, are funding retirements of past/older generations. The current workers do this with the promise of the system funding themselves at a later date when they retire.  
If the current working generation were to stop paying into the system, the house of cards would fall &amp; the system would collapse.
The intent is not to scam past or our current generation. The government, aka the operator, is certainly not making any profits. 
But don't worry, *You can Trust the government*^^TM
What is the intent of bitcoin? is it to elevate the price of a unregistered nontraditional security to extract profit of new &amp; current users?
For the most part, the valuation of bitcoin tokens is made through multiple exchanges ~~casinos~~ and multiple traders ~~gamblers~~ around the world. What does each of these people perceive &amp; how is their effort differ from any other foreign exchange trader's actions? (if those traders were trading Euros vs Dollars, instead)

The article's source:


Crashes have fascinated and baffled many canny observers of financial markets. In the strict orthodoxy of the efficient market theory, crashes must be due to sudden changes of the fundamental valuation of assets. However, detailed empirical studies suggest that large price jumps cannot be explained by news and are the result of endogenous feedback loops. Although plausible, a clear-cut empirical evidence for such a scenario is still lacking. Here we show how crashes are conditioned by the market liquidity, for which we propose a new measure inspired by recent theories of market impact and based on readily available, public information. Our results open the possibility of a dynamical evaluation of liquidity risk and early warning signs of market instabilities, and could lead to a quantitative description of the mechanisms leading to market crashes.

Combination of factors:
People took out USD loans when approaching 300 USD as they expected the price to continue to increase. The market failed to move higher than 300 USD and a portion of people got out of those positions (selling). Some of these loans were still outstanding (unpaid).
Then Market had a drop forcing people to get out of those positions at a loss. This was followed by an acceding wedge formation. When the wedge finally stopped moving higher, enough people took this as a sign it would move lower &amp; took positions accordingly (they took out bitcoin loans and sold the bitcoin with the expectation that they could buy the amount back at a lower price while keeping a portion as profit aka Short)

Ask her why her generation, was so full of hope, yet did not solve any world problems and in fact we are worse off thanks to them but they don't care because they can retire now and collect money from a system that all of us younger people are forced to pay into, all the while they complain to us why we don't have a good job &amp; savings of our own.

I bet it will be light and they will get some probation, maybe a desk job.
Most likely we will all forget this even happened in about a week from now. They will schedule the trial a year or more from now, when it happens, the plea deal will be something like "promise to be good and do some community service and enjoy a short vacation from work"

'Provably fair lottery' postings.
Look, I know you put some time/work into making something. But consider that these things are posted here often. Most are just marked as spam. These types of lottery/gambling sites are made for one of two reasons:
To make money &amp; to scam people.
Having a 'place of business' at least gives the impression that you are there to make money.

@_date: 2015-02-19 17:39:53
...because you want to have traceable records of your transaction publicly available?
I don't know, you have a 2 year old account and your asking a question here. I tried answering it by directing you to the proper subreddit. I assumed you would just search that subreddit or post the Q there..
Honestly, my opinion of using bitcoin to buy those sort of things  is the stupidest thing ever. You are publicly recording a transaction for something that law enforcement can nail your ass with.
Look at DPR, the silk road 1, and notice how MtGox got it's bank accounts SHUT DOWN. Traceable once 'they' find an address you used, they can see what else is connected with that address.

Bitcoin exists to not care. This is a private company having to exist between the bitcoin system and the traditional financial system.
These two worlds meet in Coinbase. This is the result. 
If another more friendly jurisdiction allowed another company more freedoms AND their service &amp; cost are comparable, then it becomes a race-to-end of regulations. In reality it would find the next comfortable spot between govt regs and consumer demands.

also take out insurance on those loans (betting they will default) and then collect on the insurance.
do this to an extent that the insurance company starts the fail, be 'rescued' by our tax dollars.

you could sign up on coinbase
but the process to register and get verified takes some time, and then it takes some time after 'buying' the coins to receive the coins to your account on coinbase 
after the initial process, you can give more info and enable 'instant buy' but know before you get to that point, your going have to wait
waiting is good, keeps you from making impulsive decisions.
localbitcoins is a way to get them quicker
a website like coinbase is a 'safer' way to get them, even though you have to jump through a lot of hoops.
