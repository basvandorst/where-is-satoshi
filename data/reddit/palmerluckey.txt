Credit card companies have rules that regulate what their customers cam charge for various payment methods.  If you offer 3% off for cash purchases (or anything but credit), they will kill your merchant account.

Only a Sith deals in absolutes.




Get over yourself and get a handle on proper spelling and grammar before declaring your superiority.  Men and women are different, but boiling it down to men being binary and women being more sophisticated is bullshit.  Your perception of reality is not broad enough to "deserve" anything.
To be clear, I think the goal of getting women involved with Bitcoin is a good one, the community does seem to be dominated by men.  This kind of high and mighty rhetoric is not a good way to go about it.

She is apparently on the Bitcoin Foundation board of directors.  Is it just me, or does the Bitcoin Foundation seem to be full of people who don't really speak for the majority of Bitcoin users?

Is English your first language?  A writer for an English-language magazine should be able to do better than this train-wreck of a sentence.

There are many examples of pyramid scheme masterminds getting reduced sentences in exchange for restitution.  Try to keep your 2edgy5me views stuck to reality.

No, but you did claim that the government does not care about restitution, and that they do not make deals that make victims whole.  Reality shows a different story, one where restitution is often one of the top priorities (sometimes to the point of corruption, allowing fraudsters to avoid prison entirely)
You don't have to be wealthy or lucky to get something back, especially in this case - I got goxxed myself, but I am making sure to register my claim with the trustee.  If there is any kind of payoff deal, my odds are as good as anyone else following procedure.

Another issue is that Oculus is caught up on shipping developer kits, there is not a waiting list like there used to be.  If you order, it ships out the next day.
