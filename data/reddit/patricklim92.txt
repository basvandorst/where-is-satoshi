Different asset class , not comparable. A year in equities can be a week , or even a day in crypto. If you can convince yourself not to look at your portfolio for a month ( or however long you desire ) , at least set a price target as your subjective moon. Yes price might go a lot higher if the bull market resumes , but that's better than your coin taking off to hit your profit target and reverse losing 50% of it's value while you're not watching.

  That's the big problem. Many are selling , in hope of buying back lower.

Never thought of a lambo. People that make money here in crypto that immediately goes out and order a Lambo are all morons. I am speaking of a couple hundred thousands just so we are free to pursue our true passion in life. But judging by bitcoin's price action it ain't gonna happen anytime soon.

Filipino , most of them are just too poor to educate themselves about anything.... It's pretty sad really. I hope the country will improve immensely on the coming decade.

What do you think is the biggest problem of Philippines?

Which is why this is not the same as REQ. Uneducated or misinformed redditors that say REQ is done for because Coinbase release a PAY WITH XXX button are just... hopeless. If you can't tell the difference between centralized and decentralized , why are you involve in this crypto market in the first place?
