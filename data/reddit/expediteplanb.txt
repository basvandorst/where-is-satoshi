Bitinstant has completely fucked me. They still have 200.00 from almost three weeks ago. They tried to lay it off on me giving them the wrong wallet address (after checking the numbers it was right, BTW). And when that didn't work they tried to lay it off on a third party (Coinapualt). I contacted the third party and they basically said BitInstant is full of shit. I've grown tired of emailing them and getting NO reply. They clearly are a SCAM, and I've already taken the necessary legal action. If there is anyone else still owed money from their new site launch date, I suggest you do the same.

I've yet to read about a single person getting their coins (I'm still waiting after 48 hours).

He has no reply to that. And Dan Brown? Really? What a hack. At least steal a notable writer's name (e.g. Hemingway, Poe, Emerson, Fitzgerald, Dickinson, etc). Definitely a scam. And the moneygram transfer is to Puerto Vallarta, Mexico. Fuck that. Thank you, lizard450

IT WENT THROUGH! Deposited $50 first. Instantly received a confirmation message from BitInstant saying, "Transaction Successful." Figured fuck it, put $200 more on a second moneygram. Instantly received another "Transaction Successful" email on my phone. Checked my BlockChain app and it is all there. Now, if BitInstant would kindly return the money they owe me from two days ago I would be set.

When that question is asked, one of two things happen: 
a) They give some canned, vague, non-sequitor answer.
b) They STFU and disappear. 
We are adults. A straight, no-bullshit answer would be totally acceptable (e.g. a week, a month, next millennium, etc). I"m pretty sure the online insurrection would cease if they were honest about it.

I think I'm going to try a 'small' deposit and see what happens. It's 4:40 pm cst right now.  Stay tuned....
