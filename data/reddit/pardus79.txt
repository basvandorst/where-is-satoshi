Agreed. But those customers aren't the ones in this thread demanding exchanges run LN. 
LN is amazing, but exchanges shouldn't use it. They (should) have a fiduciary duty to minimize exposure of client funds to theft as rule  Locking funds into payment channels is risky because it needs to be monitored/maintained by a live wallet (not cold storage) and can be stolen if hacked.
I suspect that it will be possible to fund a LN payment channel by telling an exchange to send your Bitcoin withdrawal to an address that funds a payment channel so that you won't need to do another step in between in order to get your funds on to LN.  But it's only something I've seen hints of and am curious if someone with a more in-depth understanding of multi-sig and payment channels can shed more light on.

Exchanges should not run lightning network because it would involve locking funds into what is effectively a hot wallet. This exposes them to risk. It's already risky enough storing your coins on an exchange. I think this is a better reason for them to not use LN than any KYC reason.

He goes into that in the podcast. You'll likely have multiple connections to other random nodes, not directly to vendors or your intended recipient(s). 
With multiple channels open, you can re-balance them by sending funds from one channel that's not depleted to another that is. Only once you've sent all your net funds out via your channels would you then need to top up. And that top up can refill all your existing channels by re-balancing them again. You shouldn't need to do that very often.

Hi there,
Thanks for writing in to Humble Bundle Support!
Unfortunately, Bitcoin has been disabled for the Humble Borderlands Bundle. The individual payment options made available for a given bundle are determined when we finalize contracts with our development partners. In this case, it was 2K Games' wish to only support PayPal, and our native credit card processor, Stripe. I'm sorry for any disappointment this may cause.
In regards to the store, we've had to temporarily disable the Bitcoin payment option due to a sharp increase in fraudulent payments in that channel. While we do not have an ETA as to when the payment option will return, we are planning on bringing it back and we are working hard on getting things fixed as quickly as possible!
Again, I'm sorry for the inconvenience here. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to write us back!

There are definitely reasons to move in and out of bitcoin!
Bitcoin is not as private as some of us would like. There are coins being developed with a focus on privacy. With submarine swaps, you can easily do BTC&gt;ALT&gt;BTC all at once and then you'll have BTC that's not linked to your KYC-based exchange account.
That's not the only reason, but it's the best one IMO.

Incorrect. Odds refers to the chances of a given outcome. House edge is the payout compared to the odds.
i.e. coin flips. 50:50 chance of heads is the odds. If you bet on heads and the house only pays 49:50 ($49 profit for every $50 you bet), then the house edge is 2%. Over the long term, after lots of coin flips and lots of people betting, the house should have a profit close to 2% of all the bets made.

You are incorrect in your understanding of static channel backups. They do not backup channel states only the channels themselves. Restoring from a SCB initiates force closes on your peer's end, sending any of your funds on the channels back to your on-chain wallet.
The inherent problem with backing up lightning funds is that if for any reason you have an outdated channel state in your backup and you attempt to close the channel using the outdated channel state, your peer can claim the entire channel's funds. That is why SCBs intentionally do not backup the live channel state.

I'm not arguing against redundant backups. I'm arguing against dangerous backups that can lose your funds.
It is dangerous to use a backup that relies on saving up to date channel states. Be it backing up your .lnd folder or if watchtowers saved channel state info (which they don't). If any of that kind of backup is out of date, you're screwed and all your funds are gone.
That is why LND implemented static channel backups that don't backup channel states. You can't accidentally fuck yourself over using them. And you can back them up to as many places as you want. I had mine automatically uploading to my cloud storage.

I thought the benefit of onion routing was that a node only knows who they got a routed transaction from (the previous node in the route) and who they are sending the transaction to (the next node in the route). And they don't know how many nodes there were prior and after them in the route.
@_date: 2019-06-24 13:22:03
Sorry, that isn't correct. The only time when that happens is when both parties agree to close a channel.
When a channel is in use, when there is an update to a channel (funds moved), "secrets" are exchanged, not dually-signed transactions. Each party only has an asymmetric version of a closing transaction that says "give the other party their coins now and give me mine after a delay". That is the transaction you send when you try to force close a channel. It is not signed by the other party. It is, in effect, countersigned by the time lock. You can't spend the funds on your side until that runs out. 
Because you are generating the force close transaction on your own, you can control the on-chain closing fees. In LND, you can set --sat_per_byte when coop or force closing a channel to control the transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-10-23 15:48:38
No they are not. Watchtowers are not given any channel info. They are not given any channel state information.

A justice transaction only sends all the funds in the channel to your side, not closing the channel based on the most recent channel state. When you use a watchtower, you're telling them to look for a transaction on the blockchain with a particular hash (you don't give them the transaction details, only a hash, for privacy reasons) and if they see it, they can decrypt the blob and publish the justice transaction. A justice transaction does not have channel state info at all. It only says "send ALL the funds to me". So a watchtower is not a channel backup source.
Also, even if watchtowers stored the channel states, it would be just as dumb to rely on them to have the most up to date channel balance as it would be to trust your .lnd folder backup to (like this dude did). If the watchtower gave you an out of date channel state, you would lose your funds trying to force close from it.

You are incorrect. LND's static channel backups do not backup the channel states. And it is done intentionally to prevent a loss of funds due to an outdated channel state.


They do exist and here's a good write-up about them. 


No it is not that. The static channel backup is only updated when a channel is opened/closed and does not save the channel state. My system only sends a copy to cloud storage when there is a channel opened or closed, which doesn't happen very often.
@_date: 2019-10-23 13:13:29
They could try to do that. But they are taking the risk of losing all their funds to you as well. Because:
A) You could be faking. You could be asking them to force close from a SBC but still have the correct channel state saved so that if they force close using a prior channel state, you could take all the funds with a punishment transaction. Especially since there is a time lock on their force close transaction. You have time between when you initialize the force close via SCB and they have the funds to post the punishment transaction.
B) Watchtowers. 3rd party lightning nodes watching for scenarios just like this.

There are two parties to opening a channel. If the node you're opening a channel with doesn't allow a channel to be used to route payments without X confirmations on the funding transaction, then you can't send a payment through that channel until X confirmations. 
If a node wants to allow 0-confirmation lightning transactions, they are the ones taking all the risk for no reward. I can think of no good reason to setup a node this way.

Every payment processor tweaks the list price for bitcoin whenever they do fiat/btc conversions in order to make a profit and help prevent losses due to price volatility between when you send them bitcoin and when they sell it on the exchange. 
It's disingenuous that they call it an extra "miner" fee because it's totally not one.
If they just came out and said "we collect x% based on reasons y and z", people would have way less of a problem with Bitpay.

It's open source software. You can change the code however you want and run it. Changing the code to allow free routing would not prevent your node from working on the network.
Arguably, free routing may not be the best idea. Fees deter attacks on the network by making it cost something in order for someone to spam a bunch of transactions.

Using the same seed will not do this. The seed determines the on-chain addresses used. The channels you have open with other nodes change all the time. Your seed can't account for that.
You can restore your channels on another node if you move all the files over.
I don't think having two running at the same time will work though because your node address includes your IP. The nodes you have channels with can only connect to one, not both nodes with different IPs.
Your better bet would be to run an LND node and then use an app or web based host to interact with your node from multiple devices, but that is less secure.

@_date: 2019-02-10 20:34:18
Why are you going to do something convoluted like that instead of funding a normal lightning channel yourself and waiting 10min for it to confirm? 
The only reason you would want to not wait for confirmation is if you're in a hurry.  But such a process would likely take more time to accomplish than just opening a channel normally.

In a bitcoin transaction there are not two kinds of fees. Only the one that goes to whoever mines the block your transaction is in, and you can set that to whatever you want.
If you are trying to refill your card $50 and bitpay is trying to get you to send to them $55 of BTC, plus the standard transaction fee, they are keeping that $5. It is how they make money. That is not at all going to the miners and doesn't effect how quickly your transaction will go through.
You don't have to pay the increased miner fee if you decode the payment invoice and pay with a wallet that lets you set the fees to a lower amount. This does not prevent you from refilling or using your card.

You'd only get taxed on the difference between the price you received it at (which you've already paid income tax on) and the price you sold it at. Not an extra 30% on the whole thing. Just the profit, which you can offset against the losses when the price goes down.
So the tax isn't a big deal since you'd likely be spending throughout the month.

Routing nodes are not getting the funds before sending them on to the next node. Actually the input transaction is dependent on the output transaction occurring.
Let's say you're a routing node and I'm sending funds to someone else through you. My transaction to you says "give these funds if an only if he sends funds to the next person". So if you don't send it on, you don't get my funds.

You cannot create a new channel using funds from an existing channel.
You would need to close an existing channel in order to create a new on-chain output that could then be used to create a new channel.
Better would be to open and fund a new channel to a new 2nd party node and send funds back around to your depleted channels, balancing them out.
But with AMP balancing will be needed less. For example, let's say I have 5 channels each with an identical balance. If I want to send 0.5btc to someone, I can send 0.1btc over each channel via AMP, keeping my channels balanced.
Eventually I would need to re-fund my channels via a new channel sending funds back to each (assuming I wasn't receiving funds from others). But that wouldn't be as often. And keeping funds spread-out is good for the network.

While I like the idea of requiring some kind of 2FA like that for outgoing funds as opposed to balancing transactions, it would still need to store keys and be online.
I'm sure someone can build a box that is pretty much just a little computer with a separate board/chip that has the hardware wallet so that things aren't exposed, but I don't think that is something I would want to use. I think development of LN/BTC is going too fast and a piece of a equipment like that, with both a node and a hardware wallet, would be upgraded far too slowly.

I'm sure there will be LN wallets that will support existing hardware wallets for signing transactions at some point. Then the keys wouldn't be stored on the node.

In order to restore the wallet (not actually spend coins), you need to have the xpubs (public keys) from each of the seeds.

Using only a single xpub from one of the keys, they cannot see the addresses on the multisig wallet. They can only see the addresses generated by the normal HD wallet from that xpub. As long as you're only using it for multisig and never use the addresses derived from the single xpub, no loss of privacy there.

There are plenty of others that can review the "ordinary user" experience. It's helpful to see the use case of someone trying to be a hub.
Once there are better protections in place to prevent loss of funds, I would hope the ordinary user experience in the future would be to have as many well-connected, well-funded channels as possible.

It's actually designed to take about 10min per block. From what I understand, the longer it takes to confirm blocks, the more secure the Bitcoin network is, which is one of the reasons why some say Litecoin is less secure/trustworthy (from what I've heard).
So it's a trade-off between convenience and security.

If you didn't include a transaction fee or if it was too low, that would likely explain it.  As you can see on [Blockchain.info]( there have been six blocks that have been confirmed in the last hour, which would mean a 10min average.

Likely, depending on your area, the owner would be required to register the machine with the local municipality and pay a tax, so that person would be responsible if anything is sold from it illegally.
To avoid that liability, most owners would need to handle stocking the machines themselves.
This would also prevent someone from selling an empty Ipad box or something, which the buyer would be unable to inspect before purchasing.
I think this would likely be used more for food vending instead of selling items/electronics.

Just tried your site.
Works great! Never going through the carrier's websites directly again.
Customer service is amazing. I had to cancel my order after paying because I had to change an address, Ivan emailed me just minutes after I cancelled it, asking if I needed any assistance, before I even contacted them about it. He was able to just edit my original order so that we didn't have to go through the whole refund and re-order process.
*That* is how you keep customers.

I bought some on the 16th, and they were just made available a half hour ago, so 9 days. On the 22nd, it said they were in my account even though the original order said "Pending", so I put in a withdrawal to my bitcoin address, which also said "Pending" until now.
I just got an email advising the coins were available and was able to withdrawal them with no further problems.
Yes, they are slow, but I got my coins.

Could be slow because of the sender. 
Being the newb that I am to bitcoin, I forgot to put a transaction fee on an outgoing payment. That held up the subsequent payments from my account until the 1st was confirmed, since they relied on the change from the first transaction.

When you're at the airport, waiting for your flight, and your flight appears to be delayed, do you look at the conveniently-placed signs around the airport which are intended to convey this information to those waiting for planes, or do you get upset that the airline has not personally called you to tell you there is a delay?
I don't expect a company to spoon-feed me customer service.  My first thought when there is a problem is "I wonder if other people are having this problem too. I'll check reddit/twitter/facebook first to see if there is any additional action required on my part before I spend time, effort and energy getting upset and contacting customer service." I think social networking is a reasonable way for businesses to communicate with a large customer base.  And I've found that sometimes, they are faster to respond to tweets than emails when there is a wide-spread problem.
