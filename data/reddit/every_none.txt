The technical fundamentals are not intact at this adoption level, much less far higher than this.  Bitcoin has massive fees with only the hope of long-term fixes in the next few years.  Ethereum was brought to a stand-still by cats and is overrun with ICO scams.  Dumb/uninformed money is the only money pouring in at this point.  We will see another great crash and then crypto will have another few years to develop further and hopefully be ready for a true wave of mass adoption later on.

You Sir, are trolling at a premier level.
I mean, it’s definitely a complete waste of the most finite resource you have available (time), but excellent work nonetheless.

Deterministic wallets weren't around before 2012 and BIP39 mnemonics didn't exist until 2013.  You can thank the developers for making your life easier than it used to be.  There's a reason that a lot of Bitcoins have been lost forever.

How exactly is making it easy for rich people to move money around the world in any way different from the current monetary paradigm?  Everyone in crypto is completely delusional right now.  There may be a time in the far future where crypto becomes a monetary panacea, but it sure as hell isn’t going to anytime soon.

This is why Bitcoin will fail.  
All believers in Bitcoin:  Ask not what Bitcoin can do for you—ask what you can do for Bitcoin.

Exactly.  His “Bitcoin” was just an entry in a private company’s database.  Just like 90% of the Bitcoin speculators today.  “Money of the future!” - LOL!  In case anyone hasn’t noticed, we’re not in the future yet.
