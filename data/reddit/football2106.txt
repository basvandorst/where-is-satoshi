So I can buy just a shitload of Gemini and still cash in later on? That’s awesome. Gonna look into this once the value settles down.

I’m waiting to buy in until it drops to ~7-10k

Just bought in your the first time. First investment ever. 
See y’all at my mansion party.

I have to ask, how much did you invest (amount invested + bitcoin amount at that time) and what is that worth now?
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:50:50
Just saw it peaked at 19.3K holy shit.
Should’ve bought in at 5K like I thought

So when should we expect this shit to crash down to $2-3K? That’s when I’ll buy in and pray for $15K again ��

So when buying bitcoin can you only buy 1-coin at a time? With its current value @ $16K can I only spend $16K for a coin or can I buy like $100 worth?

So you’re saying if I bought $200 worth of bitcoin when it was $20/coin a few years ago, I’d have $100,000 right now? Fuck me sideways....

Any apps you’d recommend for tracking/buying/selling of bitcoin? Looks like I should buy once it drops down a bit...

So when bitcoin was $20/coin a few years (months?) ago and if I would have bought 2 coins, I’d be able to collect $20K right now? When you sell your coins does it go to your debit card? Is it taxed? Do you get a check? Very confused on how you get your payout.
