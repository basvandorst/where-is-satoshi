thread on futurology: 
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:02:02
yes but this thread was about the idea of Gridcoin and he said it was checkpointed centrally
@_date: 2015-04-20 10:03:12
ok you are correct with that!
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:53:00
didn't know about this being already posted here....
Why do you think the proposed system is bad?
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:52:15
why would PoS be centraliced in any way?
So peercoin,... is also centralized in your opinion?
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:50:11
oh shit sorry I didn't know about this!
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:55:07
ok so how is Peercoin or Gridcoin checkpointed centrally?
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:51:40
why is PoS unworkable?

BOINC is not centraliced at all, there are no central BOINC-servers somewhere. Everyone can run their own BOINC projects and what BOINC projects are supported is on a basis of trust, yes, but all the projects supported now are being done by big universities, so yes they can be trusted to actual send out workunits doings science, as they also publish papers about what exactly they did.

ok so if you do not even trust big science, then why go to the doctor at all? It's a scam anyway lol.

I partially agree with you on the education part. But I disagree on the research part - big universities still do top research that brings us new discoveries and technologies, eg. see list of new patents or technological process in all kinds of industry. Maybe the first part is even because of the second, as research is what universities are really interested in, education became less important. But honestly I don't doubt that for example POEM does important research that can potentially benefit humanity.

There is a whitelist, so you can't just create your own BOINC project, it's a selected list of research projects by big universities. The voting would be about which projects to include on the whitelist and why would anyone except you vote for a custom BOINC project that does not come from a recognized instution with already published papers about it?
