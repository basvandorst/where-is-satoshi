Hey man, Krugman himself admits that this is a bigger thing than he *hoped* it would be.  He had *hoped* that the magnificent Libertarian currency would crash and burn, and he (to his credit) has admitted that it has gone on far longer than he thought it would and that it "concerns" him.
Which, of course, *delights* me.  Muwahahahaa.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:00:11


I don't think that's unsound reasoning.  I agree with this.


I disagree with this.  I think it works exceptionally well at this, and that its difficulty with "transferring value" comes from its volatile price, which comes from its relatively small market share.  We've seen it stabilize relative to its past self just this year, and it wasn't until the whole Greece crisis that it really budged meaningfully.


True, but it is a more inclusive and transparent model, and by that it *is* less susceptible to political shenanigans, because Bitcoin isn't set in stone.  We can go to another cryptocurrency if some of the forks don't appeal to us personally.  Litecoin is a viable secondary to Bitcoin, developed independently from Bitcoin's development team and using different technologies *in pursuit of a different philosophy*.  There's *already* competition in the cryptocurrency field because many, like you, feel that Bitcoin is still *too* centralized, thus Litecoin was born.


The same can be said of the Federal Reserve.  We don't elect anybody to the Federal Reserve Board, or to the Federal Open Market Committee.  And, unlike Bitcoin, which is essentially nothing more than an open-source project that *happens* to be useful as a global, decentralized currency, the money peddled by the Federal Reserve is enforced by military might.  I'm sure China and Russia would love to host the world's reserve currency, and I'm sure that doing so would confer *great* economic benefits to them, as it has us.  But they don't get to host the world's reserve currency, because we can beat them up.
Which, to me, is a pretty silly foundation for a system designed to facilitate trade.


Bit of an overstatement, I would say.  I can go and buy equipment to produce this currency... uh, today.  I cannot do the same with U.S. dollars -- that power is kept in the hands of the elites.  Mining groups are just loose organizations of Bitcoin miners, and they have to reward their users, otherwise they'll go to another group.  Also, the 51% attack (or rather, 40% attack) is a very real threat that serves as a strong disincentive for everyone involved, from the individual miner to the mining group manager.  If the dollar crashes, no big deal, the elites will remain the elites because they have on their side the power of force.  They have nothing of their own to *lose*.  Further, Bitcoin is competed with by other cryptocurrencies like Dogecoin and Litecoin, the latter of which elected to fork Bitcoin because they felt that Bitcoin's SHA-256 hashing algorithm was too friendly to ASICs, which would un-democratize the currency.  So they used Scrypt, and as a result, Litecoin's mining economics are altogether different than Bitcoin's.  Ironically, Litecoin appears to have more centralized mining than Bitcoin.
Either way, while Bitcoin isn't the wonderful utopic decentralized currency "we all want," it's a HUGE step in the right direction.  It is objectively *less* centralized than the Federal Reserve, and exposes its participants to the risks *personally* and proportionately.  Fiat currency exposes the little people to the risks, and channels a great deal of wealth to the elites who control it and who will arguably be *just fine* in the event that the whole thing comes crashing down.  That's not fair, and that's why I like the idea of cryptocurrency.


I mean, I certainly don't know the future and I certainly can't claim to speak for it, but six years of constant operation successfully tabulating transactions?  Billions of transactions daily?  Maybe Bitcoin won't be the cryptocurrency being used in 50 years (but then again *it might be*) but I'd say six years of continued, successful operation has at least demonstrated the proof of concept.  Cryptocurrency is a working model.  Bitcoin isn't perfect, but it can be *and is* being actively improved and competed against.


I don't, actually.  I'm quite aware of that fact.  That's why despite my disdain for it as a currency, I still use it.  That's why I, as a red-blooded Libertarian, can't even muster a mild grin whenever someone claims that dollars and cents are "fake money."  When I go to the gas station and present $1.69, I get a Mexican Coke.  That's pretty damn real.


Yes and no.  People are increasingly learning and building themselves to be independent of the grid of society, and that's a good thing.  Dependence on too many singular points of failure is a disaster waiting to happen, so the *more* we can push down the costs of independence, the better.  People in Romania built high-speed networks whose early content was populated by *rich people with dial-up modems*, and this was in a country where, ***today***, 45% of the population has no access to running water.  Yes, I think we could build up electronic communications pretty quickly -- there's a team of people dedicated to doing just that via meshnets.


Because the bulk of QE money sits dormant in the bank vaults where it was deposited, not being circulated throughout the economy.  Because if it were circulated throughout the economy, bank managers and Federal Reserve eggheads both know that we would see runaway inflation.


I could see that if I were hedging ALL of my bets on Bitcoin.  I'm not.
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:52:50
1. No guaranteed store of value = no predictable value.  EDIT:  I'm not going to argue that there is a great deal more EVIDENCE for the longevity of some currencies over others (e.g. gold's 6,000+ year record versus Bitcoin's... 6...), but that isn't "predictable value."  It's just historical evidence that you're inferring from in order to see the future, and you may well be wrong.
2. I fail to see how.  Clearly people are willing to spend $260 on it.  You may not see value in it, but others do.  That's fine.  I'm sure you can trust your government not to raid your bank account during a currency crisis. /s
@_date: 2015-06-30 17:33:32
1.  Bitcoin is limited in supply by mathematics, and is generally more difficult to control for political purposes than fiat currencies.  That's its value.  You may not see it, and that's fine.  Different value calculus.
2.  The same could be said of the dollar, it just hasn't faced a currency crisis yet because of how the United States maintains it's immoral hegemony on the global money supply.  That's why the dollar is "stable" and "a store of value," even though it isn't, and eventually *it will have to give* to economic realities.
I personally think that the day of reckoning isn't far off.  Maybe I'm crazy.  You probably think so.  I just can't look at six straight years of 0% interest rates and wild money printing in the form of quantitative easing (at about $1 trillion per year), both unprecedented central bank activities, and content myself with the establishment's "Everything Will Be Okay" bullshit line.
I don't *know* that Bitcoin is going to do well.  That's why I'm also investing in gold, and traditional financial instruments like stocks and mutual funds.  I'm diversifying.  That said, I'd say that looking at six straight years portending doom and gloom for Bitcoin hasn't worked out so well for the pro-fiat, pro-central banking crowd.  The price has largely stabilized (it's climbing now, thanks to the exceptional work of shortsighted finance ministers in Greece), and more and more vendors are accepting it as a means of payment.  People are exchanging this currency AND moving goods and services with it, which is better than anyone thought it would do.
In the meantime, I trust encryption works, and with my own money involved in it, I will be careful to watch cryptocurrency developments.
@_date: 2015-06-30 18:12:35


Nope.  Unlike the pro-fiat, pro-central banking crowd, I'm not ideologically stuck on inflation or deflation *but not both!*  Bitcoin is open source.  If someone doesn't like the idea of Bitcoin becoming an endlessly inflating currency, they can fork it to where it won't be.


Who, like the Federal Reserve, produce secretive policy developed behind closed doors, right?  Oh, wait, no, it's software that has literally millions of eyes on the code because it's completely fucking open source.  So that analogy goes right out the window -- even IF it stuck (it doesn't, piece of software != bureaucrats deliberating), then our system is more transparent than yours, and thus less susceptible to political machinations.


Well, I don't have reflexive hatred for corporations, so I don't have a problem with this.  But still, your analogy doesn't work, since the mining groups are the source of the currency, which would be more analogous to the Federal Reserve -- NOT "OMFG BIG CORPORATIONS."  Again, we win on this front, since the balance of power is not centralized to a single group and there is a *strong* built-in disincentive for it to ever become a single group.


If you believe this, you do not know how Bitcoin works.  Encryption works.  That can't be altered, and if it is... so be it, Bitcoin collapses and we try again.  Six years is proof of concept enough, all we need is better encryption.


Here's where we disagree:  If the USD collapsed *there would only BE Bitcoin*.  Demand for a monetary system would soon arise following the collapse of the world's centralized (and thus, doomed-to-failure) former monetary system.  Bitcoin just *works*.  You can go on about military this and 300 million people that, but the fact of the matter is **Bitcoin has not had a double spend in years**, and people are willing to trade goods, services, *and other currencies* for it.  We already know it works.  It would just fall into place if the world's preeminent monetary system collapsed.


I'll agree that for a time, there wasn't.  Following the 2008 Financial Crisis, that changed, and the rate at which our central bank is printing money is [historically unprecedented]( AKA "wild."


I guess I disagree, man.  I don't dispute that it will suck, but it can suck with a light at the end of the tunnel.  I'm not crazy, but I'm also 100% against this notion that "Society Knows Best" and to just assume that civilization is a granted thing.  It's not, and the people who are for some reason in charge of running civilization are pretty goddamn terrible at it.  The ONE redeeming factor is that they're probably terrible at it because they think they're doing good for the world...

I hate how people are so quick to jump to assign people who disagree with them on gender issues "misogynists."  It further raises my ire when they then accuse others of "not listening" and "being dishonest" when those others "don't understand" their arguments.  Horseshit.
You label every single person who disagrees with you as a hateful, evil human being.  That's reason enough for me to give anyone a pass for not giving you the time of day, but I'm still happy to read your shitty, male-shaming, pseudo-intellectual arguments because I want to understand where people are coming from.  I actually agree with the Social Justice League on a number of things, such as the fact that "nurture" plays a role in our upbringing and our views of others, and that millennia of oppression and social stratification don't just go away.
I just don't agree with their prescriptions of racial and gender employment quotas, racial and gender compensation requirements, racial and gender acceptance quotas at colleges and universities, etc.
What's "problematic" in my comment above is that I recognize inequality in the world in which I live, because everyone **isn't** equal.  I am not Michael Dell.  Michael Dell started his business in his college dormitory and transformed the way personal computers (and goods in general) were sold to the public.  In the early days, he worked long hours calling clients, working on his product, networking, etc.  He's not better than me because he's rich, white, or Christian.  He's better than me because he put the hours in, he put the legwork in, he toiled over the matter that was his dream until he had it in his hands -- and then he worked some more.  I admire that.
Maybe, one day, I can count myself among the greats.  Maybe I'll never be able to.  That's okay.  It's not the end of the world, I'd be happy if I could raise children who view humanity as I do, try to be charitable to all, regardless of creed, skin color, or gender identity.  But the simple fact of the matter is that some people exact superior outcomes from equal opportunities, and your ilk attempts to reduce people's accomplishments to the variables that surrounded them rather than the person themselves.  You could give every single human being the *exact* same upbringing, access to capital, education, cost of living, socioeconomic background, etc, and inequality WOULD manifest itself.
Do I know where the distribution of men versus women in various career fields is going to be?  No, I don't.  I have no idea.  But I know that I don't see a gender imbalance in a given field and immediately think, "Oh my goodness, something must be done!"  
Have you ever even considered the possibility that men are better at some things than women?  Or that women are better at some things than men?  And that, maybe, career fields that exploit those characteristics most strongly will reflect that in their gender makeup?

I don't know where I'd draw it, and I guess that's the point.  I think [comment]( is quite accurate - I've grown up my entire life in a relatively comfortable, cookie-cutter, white, middle-class suburban first world liberal democracy.  I've only *read* about the past atrocities committed by governments, which seem to make the current atrocities perpetrated by our current government pale in comparison.  
I'd like to think I'd be helping the revolution for a better world, but I'm at a point in my life and with my beliefs where... I don't think violent revolution, even against an unambiguously evil institution, would do any good.  People ARE wildly statist, and until that changes you'd almost certainly end up replacing the U.S. Government with some other government.  How can you be certain that it'd be better, especially when historically revolutionary governments almost never are?  It's poetic and larger than life to think about given the facts surrounding the birth of our country, but that's the thing:  *WE'RE* the outlier, we're the country that was separated from the mother country by a then-difficult and expensive ocean to cross, and with no meaningful native resistances, and with abundant lands and natural resources.
If it didn't happen in 1776, it would've happened in 1780, or 1790, or 1800 until it DID happen.  But that was then, and this is now, and NOW, Leviathan is hosted here, on our shores, and is more powerful than ever before.  The circumstances are different, and the stakes are orders of magnitude more.  The people in power know that more than you or I, because they're the ideological warriors dressed as moderates.  Government doesn't exist to regulate us, the government exists to regulate *them*.  They agree to wear their socially-accepted labels of moderation (Republican, Democrat) with the agreement that they won't use violence against one another to further their ideologies.
Fighting the authorities is an almost meaningless effort.  Look at Ross Ulbricht.  I think running the Silk Road was a great thing, a grand experiment in the power of markets.  They're not booking him because he committed some great evil, because we can objectively say that the Silk Road *protected* users and facilitated peaceful exchange - a feature that has long been desperately sought for by psychoactive drug consumers.  But it ran afoul of words on paper, and without it's "examples," the emperor wears no clothes.  So he'll be dragged out, his life destroyed, and the overwhelming majority of people will cheer for it.  
And his resistance wasn't even directly confrontational!  He was just competing with the state!  Look at all the people who DID try to fight the state, they're dismissed roundly as would crazies, even by myself in some cases.  What good do we do towards the rejection of willing submission to the state, by causing reckless destruction and becoming crazies?  None, sadly.  I think the best we can hope for is by being good citizens (since the bulk of the population will, however annoyingly, judge us partly on that point) and exposing the sheer inanity of the state's edicts by peacefully and lawfully competing with it.  The state is, after all, a human institution and therefore fallible - way moreso than human endeavors that produce and deliver actual goods and services.
Vote.  Compete.  Live free, show by example.  I think that's the best you can do to beat Leviathan.

You will get no dispute from me on that.  I think the model you highlighted above would work very well for government IT, which I would argue has more of an obligation than private IT to open the source.

That isn't true.  People pay for Windows because it's fucking usable, man.  Because you don't have to dip into an incomprehensible command line that takes months, *years* even, to become fluent and capable of doing basic computing tasks with.  Because it's supported by manufacturers and software developers and online services.
Because their developers are talented, focused, and most importantly, *aware that they're on the same team*.  They're focused on some great, unified vision, which is shaped by market analysis.  They're all working together, unlike most open-source developers embroiled in the Mir vs. Wayland contest, or systemd vs. init argument, or "Free and Open Source" versus "open source" debate, or "GNU/Linux" versus "Linux" quarrel, or whatever the myopic and utterly inconsequential open-source "controversy" of the day is.
I badly want Ubuntu on my Dell Venue 11 Pro, but there's no support for it.  There might be, if some of these open-source developers could shelve their completely trivial quibbles and fucking code for the greater good -- that same "greater good" that they claim to support when they fork an understaffed, underfunded project because the coordinators used someone else's if statement instead of theirs.
Meanwhile, Microsoft pushed tens of millions of copies of Windows 10 to tens of millions of computers.  I want an operating system that guards my privacy, but I'm not up to anything beyond smoking pot here and there.  I need an operating system that I can get work done on, and until that happens on Linux, I'm stuck in Microsoft-land.


Translation:  "People buy Apple because Apple **caters to consumer demands**." 


Servers are run and managed by the technically literate, so they're not afraid of it.  Also, they only need to deal with the techie stuff until all of the necessary services are running, then it's pretty much set and forget.  It's good that Linux is winning the backend.  Now let's figure out a way to get it up on the frontend.


We both know why Android has market share, and it definitely involves closed-source software and software patents.  When Replicant or even CyanogenMod approaches that level of market share, you'll have a good point - but Android, as it is packaged and shipped on the VAST majority of consumer smartphones, is not friendly to the "Free" in "Free and Open-Source Software."  In many cases, it isn't open, either.  Bear in mind that carriers AND manufacturers are permitted to add their own "features" to it, and they don't have to share that code (and don't).


Not for lack of trying.  Microsoft, Google, and Apple aren't sitting on their hands while a HUGE sink of market share awaits great software.

Feel free to talk shit about Microsoft, Oracle, and Google, but organizations use these solutions and pay for them because *they work*.

This is the 80-20 rule in play.
I love free and open source software, but I don't think the business model is the only type of viable suggests business model, especially when you're talking about businesses and consumers that just want their shit to work for as inexpensively as they can get it to.  Someone will invariably fork your code (hello, Amazon!) and undermine all the hard work your organization performed.
It is for this reason that I'm largely unconvinced that software patents are evil.  There's a reason that the world's biggest software companies were founded and headquarters in the United States, and I would argue that the existence of IP laws that protect their development is an important part of that.

I am confident in the talents of my country's developers.  Quality is subjective, and quantity isn't an inherently bad thing.
I'm glad my country's software developers can be compensated for their work.

We want it to, no doubt.  But at its current valuation?  There's no way for it to.  The metric of "value" is still calculated in USD, and presumably that will be that way for a long time to come.

Astute observation.  Money controls aren't NECESSARY for states to exist, but they sure do extend the level of control that they possess -- and the bigger ones are deathly dependent on it.  Bitcoin means freedom from economic manipulation, which is *huge*.

Eh.  Read reputation.  I sent $1000 cash over the mail and got some BTC out of it.  Guy could've taken the money and run, but he didn't -- his 600+ review, 5-star rating was worth way more than that.

Upvoted for not jumping onto the "is banker, therefore evil" bandwagon.
Dimon supplied an opinion.  An opinion which we should all take very seriously, IMO.  Here's an unpopular opinion:  I think Jamie Dimon is pretty alright.  Banking isn't bad.  The government's regulation of finance and perversions of financial incentives is what's made it so bad, and which has consequently made Bitcoin an attractive market proposition.
That said, the recent EU decision will make it pretty tough for big, sovereign governments to make it a pain in the ass.  Route that shit through Tor, then what, bitches?

Buy BTC with cash.

Then you'd be blaming the shopkeeper, which makes you a dick.

This is the world's newest financial system, we're six years in mang.
We have to be allowed to try things... and... fail, sometimes.  That's part of growth.  Bitcoin has brought some great things to the table.
