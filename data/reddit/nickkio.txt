Trezors have a feature called "hidden wallets" where you can store two or more wallets on the same device and you just use a different password to select which wallet you want (the wallets are all otherwise invisible). So when a thief tells you to unlock your wallet, you just unlock the 'false' one with only a small amount of value within it.

The way the [passphrase feature]( actually works is that it forms part of the wallet seed. So you can choose literally any password (up to 50bytes long) and the trezor will produce a wallet from that seed. New wallets take up no additional space, and there is no indication how many exist or whether they do exist.
Your solution will not work

Just giving any random word for the passphrase will return a wallet with a balance of zero

You actually need to send everything to one address *in a single transaction*. If you were to instead send multiple TXs to a single address, that receiving address would have multiple UTXOs and would still be somewhat fragmented.

You'd think but that is not what we experienced last time.

it's a [backronym](

It's a joke.
Since Bitcoin is distributed, if a handful of people were to control over 50% of the nodes they would effectively have control over bitcoin.
In the OP the market capitalisation of Bitcoin accounts for 51% of the total crypto-currency market cap.
51% control of network very bad for Bitcoin holders. 51% market cap good for those who believe Bitcoin is the one true coin.

Unless your laptop comes preloaded with malware or serious security bugs. See [superfish]( and [wannacry/eternalblue](

Yeah poor choice of wording on my part. Thanks for the correction

you could mine it?

Put your coins into a paper wallet. Nice and simple, you know for sure you control the private key (since a paper wallet is basically just a piece of paper with the private key written on it).

From what I understand, if you control your private keys to your bitcoin now, then you will maintain the private keys to valid coins on all forks that occurs after now.
Since Coinbase does not give you access to even your public keys (since a lot of coinbase txs are probably not on-chain anyway), there is no way for you to even monitor your coins on any fork other than what coinbase gives you access to, and you basically are forfeiting your coins on forked chains. 
This isn't inherently evil; off-chain transactions mean that txs within coinbase can have lower or 0 fees. That said, there's no real reason not to just move your funds to an external wallet address that you fully control until after all this blows over.

From my understanding, yes. You have a single address/set of keys, that are valid and full of your coins on both blockchains. Then you just insert that key into a client that works on either system. There should be clients after the fork that will deal with both chains/splitting the coins for you, which would be the safest and easiest bet.

You should go and read the whitepaper if you want to learn how bitcoin works. There's no central authority who can dish them out like steam trading cards.
