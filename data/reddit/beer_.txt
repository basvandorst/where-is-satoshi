Well maybe I can learn from it then.  Everyone has to at one point
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:12:52
better than gox...
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:12:35
but the GOX price isn't the actual price for BTC right now.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:33:49
then thats true, and sucky that is.

@_date: 2014-02-21 02:37:14
I like to state the obvious.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:36:50
thank you! I appreciate it
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:27:31
bitcoin is at $91 on gox, not elsewhere.
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:02:26
I didn't, I asked.  I learned, now I do.   Get off your high horse
@_date: 2014-02-21 16:34:18
I appreciate it!
@_date: 2015-01-07 17:01:51
lol.  Right.  Like hell im going to send anything to a fucking scam site like that.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:25:53
I hate to sound like an idiot, but could you explain the paper wallet to me?   I have them holding everything I own right now...what should I be doing?
@_date: 2017-06-12 11:18:52
Not quite sure I call a ~200 dollar drop a freefall, but to each their own I suppose
@_date: 2013-12-18 01:55:22
I'll try, this would help huge for me this year.  
Merry christmas everyone!

I've had no issues with coinbase for what its worth!
edit: saw he had no CC.  So it won't work for him.  I opened a card with a 250 limit I use for things like this, obviously without any intention of ever having to draw from it.  Maybe something OP can look into!
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:46:00
Ah, yes.  I forgot thats why I had to do that.
I know it was part of verifying my account, maybe I just got that mixed up!
