No, I was saying that his rule can be applied to any form of "gambling" (and yes, the market is gambling.  You are putting money into an option/stock in the hopes that it gains money, but it very well might lose money or even go to 0 - this is the very definition of gambling).  Always have a target exit number, whether you are playing a few hands at a blackjack table or trading a stock.  It ensures you walk away with a profit and don't risk losing initial capital by getting greedy/cocky and taking unnecessary risks.

Oh look, an edgy pseudo-communist teenager who has never posted proof of a single trade wants to say **I** know nothing about financial investing.  That's funny bro, now get back to pouring my latte.

How does a stock gain or lose value?  It's all about buyer perception and demand.  That's why you see scenarios where a company beat it's expected earnings and the value of the stock still drops when earnings are called.  So now you not only have to do your DD on the financial side of the company, but you also have to predict how the market will react to the information.  That's random chance my friend, and by your own definition a gamble.  Physical items are not the same because they have utility in most cases (besides art and the such).
