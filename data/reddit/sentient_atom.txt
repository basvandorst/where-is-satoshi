I'll have you know he painstakingly recreated the scene from memory in MSPaint!

fiat is fake too
@_date: 2019-07-02 01:38:30
If this is true, you really should have had some private wallets, none the less I wish you luck.

Can you please upload a marker timestamp of your ribs so we can validate youre skimny/malnourished, not full of shit?

coinbase, or use bitquick.co to  do cash deposit bank transfer
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:49:39
Time to buy BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:08:30
Gemini taking indefinite time to verify, gdax is owned by coinbase.

1. We don't serve sinks here.
2. Yes we agree, wire fees are bs; exchange rates are bs.

I love how the world's nations are all closing in on that dystopian future where everyone is tracked all the time, where big government has a hand in every transaction, and where theres no privacy whatsoever. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 23:53:52
This is strictly a method of tracking. They will say it's to stop drugs. They'll say it will fight criminal behavior. All its going to accomplish it more data rolling in, on what people buy and from whom.
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:04:01
Why would you say such hurtful words!?

Smells like shit.

BTC exists in a superposition; it stays permanently in ascent and freefall simultaneously. That collapses into one or the other depending on whether you are looking to buy or sell.
@_date: 2019-08-04 00:50:09
Probably sent  ack to an abandoned acc
@_date: 2019-02-25 15:45:42
Nice patina bro.
@_date: 2019-01-27 20:16:26
Well adoption will make the currency healthier as trade volume increases, I was imagining you had benn holding it like a stock. Sorry had been drinking.

critical analysis
@_date: 2019-01-08 23:50:50
I have been using the Rii (there are a few versions) for a decade, cool ass kb/m, sucky touchpad but it works.
@_date: 2019-01-02 06:41:55
Just wait til a private sat  for this purpose goes up. Cube sats getting cheaper all the time.
@_date: 2019-01-27 18:26:20
Don't spend your BTC while BTC is devalued. Imo
@_date: 2019-01-02 07:06:37
Good point, no where near the bandwidth to allow global coverage of the ledger and transaction handling. But that would be nice...
@_date: 2018-11-12 02:48:08
PM me a BTC and I will share in your fortune and will fuel my small business. Or you  could donate to wounded warriors, Mayo Clinic, Volunteer Firefighter Stations, Ronald McDonald foundation, St. Judes,  etc
@_date: 2018-11-12 02:52:54
is it truly possible to live off dividends from amount like this?
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:28:40
Fucking bastard!
@_date: 2015-04-01 22:32:20
 isn't funny, this fucking blows.
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:23:10
I suggest using a different computer entirely running Tails off a stick for Tor. Under a VPN if you have any sense, to hide your IP from the Tor network too.
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:17:04
Wouldn't want anyone to miss out on being tracked.
First came DMCA peddled legislation to shut down ISPs without a court order, then came wiretapping emails and communications without a court order, now they are going after encryption and anonymity directly. 
@_date: 2016-05-08 09:20:51
I hope it brings enough attention to the continued spying and tracking of everyone to encourage a surge of new encryption schemes and dark net protocols. 
They're going to scream c hild p0rnography though. 
And everyone will cave.
Soon it will be "Little Sarah is 14, she might be hiding CP in her snatch so we have to give her a full cavity search". 
@_date: 2016-05-09 01:05:48
You're right, sorry I came back later without re-reading my own post. 
The fact is that is how they have achieved many unreasonable seizures and searches. 
I am wholly against child abuse in any form especially sexual exploitation, but we don't go around searching red car owners homes and violating their rights because there was recently a hit and run by a red car.
Due process is being shit on from civil asset forfeitures, to domain take downs without court orders, to no knock raids. 
It's pathetic what we have slumped to.
@_date: 2016-05-08 22:00:02
But see the fact you bought sick fucks into shows you're buying into their fear tactics. Pedo bullshit is one of the main anti-encryption arguments. Just like they said reefer would drive you made as an argument against legalizing it. 
@_date: 2017-07-12 23:42:39
I'm strongly opposed to losing my kickback, she means.

Sounds like he has an expert understanding of how to create hyperinflation.
