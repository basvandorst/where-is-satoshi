If it goes to zero, everyone will have 0 Bitcoin too! Simple maths.
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:14:10
Is it maybe because people are valuing $1 worth of Bitcoin more than a $1 worth of Tether?
I didn't know people could value the same thing on different prices. I mean an ounce of gold is worth the same everywhere in the world. 
Edit: I think this is the inefficient market I've been reading about all along in books etc.

I was in that group too. It's very disappointing to lose money left and right because we didn't did research. The thing is, nobody knows what the hell is going on. The best we can do is go and make our own decisions. Yes we can make bad calls and watch the thing skyrocket. But when we gather the expertise, we will protect ourselves from these scenarios. To me were fairly obvious but most people don't have 5-8 hours a day of looking at a charts/price action to figure out the personalities of the coins.

Ever heard of a Ginny in a bottle? It's the same, but it only grants one wish...print me some more Tethers.
@_date: 2018-01-22 22:14:02
Why I read this in every thread? If you had a $17k Bitcoin and now that same Bitcoin is worth $11k...guess what? You have 11k in Bitcoin that would buy exactly $11k worth of goods. It becomes real when it this happens not when you sell. This is the exact definition of a bag holder. 
Better advice would be to limit your losses to 3-5% and wait for the next run up. It's better to "lose" 5% and then get back in lower and gain 5%. In this stage of bitcoin when the volatility is this high you are literally throwing money away if you hold for more than a day or two.
Remember people, if you lose 50% of your investment you need 100% to get it back. Don't throw money away and limit your loses to 3-5% at most.

I feel sad for all the people not cutting loses at 3-5% at most and have to suffer through all this shit without reading a single book about investing. Sweet Jesus.
Edit: The people who downvote have been downvoting everyone since we were at 17k we are at 10k now. You telling me holding bags is healthier than dumping your coins at a modest 5% loss and picking up "cheaper" if its surely going up? Crazy kids.

If bit coin goes down to $4500 you will have $25. The percentage loss will proportionally reflect on your holding.

Please don't do anything based on us. We are talking about a trading strategy and it's based on buy low and sell high. It's risky if you don't know what you are doing. I suggest to wait for it to go below 17 and buy in the 16's. If anything don't buy in the 19's if you can't stomach a $1000 loss (on paper not real though unless you sell) for market correction. This is not professional advice.

@_date: 2017-12-25 18:02:43
I second this. Buy at the low of any day, then wait a little and buy of it dips. I have done this  because it averages down your coin. It is the best strategy out there if you think it ain't going to zero. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 04:01:09
@_date: 2017-12-15 03:00:28
Yes it's true, but then again we don't see 1000 Bitcoin orders flying around often. It's kind of incredible.

Look at the chart (1 day time frame) and see where the shit hit the fan literally. This is part of normal consolidation. But it's kind of optimistic to think we aren't going to test the support that got all of this started.

Yes. The thing is the majority will lose money because it's "easy". What they don't know is the training behind taking correct calls and siting on your but to see what's happening and give it a real reason to pull the trigger.
At the moment, I'm becoming more profitable and I agree with you, sometimes it hits us hard, but with all the opportunities, it's fairly easy to bounce back. 
Protecting profits and cutting loses is the name of the game.
