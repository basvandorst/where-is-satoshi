My idea to bring identity ownership back to the individual is a project I called  its a tool to for users to build a decentralized ID on the blockchain integrated with the PGP web of trust. With it, your ID is verifiable on the blockchain-only by the people you choose to give your identity to. Meaning for any group that chooses to accept the blockchainMe ID your sensitive information isn't held on a central server or database, but on blockchain, as a crypto digest that isn't traceable back to you.
Also, I'd agree with blockchainnoob its bad practice to use a wallet more than once. If your moving move from a bitcoin wallet associated with your name (like a coinbase account), I'd move it from one new wallet to the next to distance yourself from that bitcoin address with your name.
@_date: 2015-06-08 18:52:44


I've thought a lot about this.. and I think a "verified ID" is going to require a central agency, doesn't necessarily mean a government but central agency non the less. The verification from blockchainMe is the PGP web of trust. Your network of signed signatures is evidence for the validity of your identity. 
Thanks for checking out the project!

Exactly. I have huge respect for Ron Paul. Disappointed in him coming out against Trumps immigration policy. Perfect example of why I'm not a libertarian anymore. He advocated for ending the welfare state, THEN opening the borders. Which doesn't work when there the large majority of people in the world dying to come here don't share our values.

That's an interesting component. They call themselves Anarchists, but they all have a blatant hatred for capitalism. As noted on their signs, and their thrashing of private property. At the risk giving their media team more credit than they deserve, I see their "Anarchist" label a cover for their hammer and sickle core. This is what socialists look like when they lose an election.

Does it really matter? If there are 1000 protesters, and 100 of them are violent, it's the violent ones that burn buildings, break windows, and beat people down. The peaceful protesters are irrelevant.

The cost of education is wayyyy over inflated. The internet made it possible to teach people for next to nothing years ago. Public education hasn't kept up with technology, and we're not allowed to keep up, because it's a government protected monopoly.

But if I dont need the private key. If I'm just looking for the namecoin address that corresponds to the bitcoin address I've generated as a hash of a document. Is it possible to generate a namecoin address from a bitcoin one?

I would have supported an increase to 2MB. But there are other network scaling issues outside of the specific block size debate. And I think it's more important to maintain the value of Bitcoin as a currency over a payment platform.

It's true? The vast majority of the master mind media is very liberal. Which I wouldn't mind if they admitted it. But they pretend to be balanced and objective and that dishonesty is the real danger. The fact that they were so wrong and cocky about Trump in the polls proves so much of this.

I've seen this too. The scary version of this story is when PizzaGate broke out, several media outlets published stories on how pedophilia is JUST LIKE being gay and its something you can't control implying we should have sympathy for it.
That same week I heard two people damn near quote that sentiment.

He's more libertarian than the libertarian party. Socially liberal, financially conservative, and he's not some ivy league community organizer. He's a businessman that has a provable record of getting things done.


Read up on tech. Don't ask apple to implement backdoors.


Voluntarism is the extension of the nonaggression principle, I'd like to see a world without states where people respect property rights and free trade. But we're so far away from that goal it might as well be a utopia. Freedom is not something that is just reasoned though intellectually, it has to be fought for and protected. If I could have voted the country into a magically free society I would have.

He has good advisers around this. Hopefully, Peter Thiel is his go-to man on the topic. For the most part, I bet they leave the nerds alone. Which is really the best case scenario. If Trumps stamps a tax on remittances, that kind of capital control would be really great for Bitcoin.

You're right. When it comes to apple, trusting that open source code is what the developer say it is the best we have. For a number of reasons on Apples end, the binaries develops submit aren't exactly what the user gets. So releasing a checksum of the code does no good if we know its never going to match. I'm going to open this up to iOS programing sub-reddit [here]( and see if we can come up with something better than "Just trust me".
