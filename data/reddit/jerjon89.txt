Watch entire video and review your insights.

How will the USA ban crypto’s in your view, is it really likely and feasible??
Take into account that they might miss the ship entirely, will they take the risk of being left behind?
Especially since USD will colapse sooner or later.
I like to read your contraversial views altough I don’t agree on the majority
But please dont throw names around in your replies. Looks immature.
Lets keep it interesting and respectful, dont reply with demeanor please.
Just doesnt help us to get along...

One of the answers is: Bitcoin doesn’t gain value... your fiat loses value..
The question is, what is value for you?

Taxes have been The tool to,redistribute wealth. 
91% taxes for the most wealthy as in Eisenhower’s time? 
People dont like taxes. But they are wrong, we should pay more taxes, those who can afford it atleast.
What doesnt mean that those who cant would not have any responsibilities....

I do have some experiences with my bank:
My bank requires 3 days+  for an international  transaction...
My bank requires 2 days+ for a national transaction to another bank...
I gave my bank the order to liquidate my pensionsaving fund two weeks ago, aparently it takes them 15working days to get My funds transfered... ‘because paper is involved’....
1 of my banks has been caught multiple times for moneylaundring, they pay a fine which is smaller than the earnings they made doing moneylaundering. Big insentive to proceed with such behaviour...
‘My’ money on my bank isn’t mine according to the legal setup. It’s a loan I gave to the bank. When (not ‘if’) my bank goes bust due to very risky rent seeking behaviour, rip savings.
My bank only has a fraction of it’s total balance in ownership. Aka fractional reserve banking.
My bank thus, has the right to create money out of thin air, inflating the money supply. Reducing my saving’s purchasing power. 
My bank account is subject to the European bail-in law, which upon bankruptcy risks my savings to be used to cover there risk-seeking-behaviour-went-wrong-canyon to be filled..
My bank charges money when I withdraw cash at another bank’s ATM machine. Recent ‘feature’. 
My bank pays 0,11% interest on my deposits. Which is the legal minimum in my country, a very rare law. Inflation = just below 2%. Net result: my savings lose more than 1,5% each year..
Out of the 4 major banks in my country, 2 of their ceo’s have publicly stated that such minimum interests wont be able to maintained. Look at other European countries... Denmark for an example, a bank ‘charges’ -0,5 interest on home loans. Sustainable policy you recon?
My bank, like others, is over it’s ears ‘invested’ in negative yield bonds. Another sustainable policy^^
Not sure about mine, but other banks requires refinancing overnight, the only thing which keeps it standing is the liquidity provided by the central banks via quantitive easing. Oh, the last part is actualy applicable to my bank :/     Aka ‘Too big to fail’...
So yeah, not a big fan of today’s banking cartel to put it lightly. 
Besides, most of the above you mentioned is already (or becoming) feasible with Bitcoin.
Technology has just once again reshaped an ancient business.. nothing special realy.
Although it kinda is when our most important good is involved. Money: used for every half of each transaction.

Euro will end, USD will end, all fiat currencies come to an end!
And with the rapidly-ever-extending-money-supply policy we globally worship, their design has been altered significantly (negative rates) to colapse soon.
USD will stand tall longer than most others, but it will lose it’s position as world reserve currency, probably to China. Things can go fast from there on.
Just as the German Kron after WW1, or the current Zimbabwan, argentinian or venezuela currency... they don’t last.
Average lifespan of a world reserve currency is about 70 years. How long has USD been in that position? What drives the actual demand, and thus value for the USD? Oil! The Saudideal in 1973 guarenteed the US to spend as much as they desire, for there will always be demand for the USD since the Saudies and there ‘partners’ are only selling oil for USD. Some governments had other plans.. Khadafi, Sadam Hussein, Mosaddegh or the current Iran ‘government’.
The US has the most to lose, will they hold on to their (military/emporial) powers?
As a European I’m not proud of our policies here, but US policies would be feeel soo embaricing to me. 
Look at what these policies did for the US as a whole... there are soo many problems in it’s society. 
The US is one of the last! - and i’ very serious - countries where I’d want to live. Not even considering whats to come.. just looking at it’s current state.
Again, not proud of Europe either. 
The following speech shows some genuine researched facts and some down-to-earth viewpoints in my opinion.
In his talk he mentions that a historian estimates the colapse prior to 2030. Interesting...

‘Your’ money in your bank in legal terms, is a loan to your bank, on which your bank pays an interest. If the bank defaults on that loan, rip ‘your’ funds... 
so no, definatelly NOT your money!
Not your bank, not your money...

Crony capitalism! We haven’t seen Capitalism in decades. Do not concider capitalism as the devil.
Basically we don’t use our capital anymore, there is none left.  We have a whole other system too blame, somehow we keep calling it capitalism...
We dont live in a democracy with a capatalistic system, we live in a cleptocracy with a debt bases system.

Oh, me to. Thanks for your insight. But don’t mistake the current state of a technology with it’s potential/future state.
‘I will Never need a cellphone’ said my father 15years ago.. well, times change, he also found out.
It’s a banking cartel, Cartel: a group of similar independent companies who join together to control prices and limit competition. 
And capture the legislatros, with absurd compliance expenses making it impossible for smaller banks to compete, lookup lobby nr’s in the sector, political ‘donations’, the revolving door between banks and ‘top politicians’,,.
You have it wrong on that collateral part of loaning in my opinion.
So, you take a loan to buy a car, after 5 years you payed of your loan + interest... where is the counter part of the money being created in there account now???
Big banks make it hard to compete with them. And if you suceed and reach a certain treshold as smaller bank the big bank consolidates. Goes for many sectors nowadays..
It’s the entire banking system which is rotten, switching to another one aint gonna solve the problem.
If you make the moral excercise that the banking industries business model is uniquely favored, that it expands inequality by design, that it profits from risky-rent-seeking behaviour and when loses are to be dealt with, society has to jump in to prevent their to-big-too-fail status from collapsing, which leads to a continuation of prior proven non-sustainable system architecture. 
If you morally accept such a system, you support it’s architecture and all flaws involved. Bright future of inequality ahead!
If you morally reject such a system, you minimise your part in it to eventually exit for good, you study it and explain the flaws to those interested.
But in the latter case, if you dont support the banking cartel, you look for other ways. Not for another route which is controlled by the same industry.
You answer 9/10 ‘switch banks’.. No! Make a responsible decision, study what is going on, do you agree with their course or not, if not, act accordingly. 
Take responsibility, act responsible. Your action has impact.

If you dont see the bitcoin relevance, go back to study monetary history and the current monetary model. The end of USD will create a void which has to be filled. Euro will collapse first btw, so another gap to be filled... not relevant????

For me, electicity usage is far from the key value which makes Bitcoin ‘have value’.
Electricity usage has been the first method to assist network validation, since then we have seen plenty of other methods to validate transactions on a blockchain network. Network validation method’s are crucial, but it’s not the key metric to determine Bitcoin’s potential (as currency.)
To me, Bitcoin’s main intrinsic value is it’s mathmatical proven and time-tested design.
That is the unique innovation Bitcoin brings to the table when we look a medium we can use to exchange goods and services.
If you look at all properties you idialistically would want a medium of exchange to have, Bitcoin is By Far the one who gets the closest to that ideal.
Fiat has plenty of flaws, gold goes a long way up that scale, but still fals short to Bitcoin.
Bitcoin is thus not backed by electricity..
Bitcoin brings guarantee of trust, without the need of a middlemen. Thus, absolute trust is Bitcoin’s prime technology.
A feature which comes in very handy when one is looking for a medium of exchange.
Fiat requires our general trust for it to work, Bitcoin’s design enables trust.

They can't even spell 'crypto' properly...
Isn't there an alternative for this?
How can Visa enable [Crypto.com]( cards to be used at all their pos's?
Doesn't that conflict with the 'virtual currency or e-wallet or e-money that can be monetized, re-sold or converted to physical/digital goods/services or otherwise exit the virtual world"  statement?
What a BS statement btw... but then again, it holds ground in the US since it's seen as a commodity by the CFTC.
In most of Europe it is considered a currency, thus as virtual as the Euro.
