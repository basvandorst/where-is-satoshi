Licensed fiduciary here, can confirm. Everyone and their mother is asking about BitCorn.  You snarky fuck. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:20:22
Because not all financial decisions are based on buying investments.

No one knows what a fiduciary is. 
Am fiduciary. 
The term “financial advisor” is broad and can mean anything from your life insurance guy, to your stock broker, or CFP.  
Not all people who call themselves “financial advisors” are bad people, but a lot of them don’t even realize they’re often making a bad recommendation

Doubt it
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:58:27
Because not every financial decision is determined by your stock market gains.

Am fiduciary, can confirm. Someone will have our ass if we’re caught recommending crypto. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:18:48
That’s fine. There’s a lot more to financial advising than stock market gains.  Even if your FA knew your potential gains in crypto could be 2148%, it would be unwise for him to advise you to invest any substantial amount of money into it.

This isn’t what his statement is going for, and you’re making a lot of assumptions about OP.  
The rhetoric is the fact that so many average Joe’s are inquiring about bitcoin now means that this current bubble is going to continue on for quite a while before it stops. 
I’m a fiduciary, who made a lot of money on crypto currency.  Keep looking for a boogeyman.

No they’re not.

This whole sub is turning it into some grand conspiracy. Most BofA associates still don’t know what bitcoin is and probably never will.

That is strange. No idea.

Any reason they want. They don't even tell us and we are not allowed to discuss reasons for account closures with clients as it may violate bank secrecy act laws. Likely they don't want anything that could be perceived as sketchy going through their networks as it could create a potential loss for the bank. Internet gambling sites also use BC and the bank told us to report anything having to do with online gambling. 
Basically, when you signed the agreements to open the account, you gave the bank the right to close your account for any reason they please. And they don't have to tell you why. It's always the hardest thing to explain to an irate customer and something I hate having to do.

Personal banker at Big 4 bank here.
Yes, the bank will absolutely close your account without telling you why (they will throw around the phrase "we have made a business decision to close your account).  Newly opened accounts are more highly scrutinized because they carry the highest risk, and most fraud and money laundering happens in newly opened accounts as opposed to one that has a history of legitimate transactions.  Wire transfers in particular are put under the microscope more often as well.  
It's really nothing personal, it's just the bank covering its ass.  And in reality, you're just a number so they expect and have already planned to close x number of accounts like this per year.
Sucks - I'm going to have to find another way to move money between my bank and wallet soon as my trades are getting larger.  I have made small bitcoin purchases daily to my coinbase account, as well as a the occasional 5 figure transfer, but nothing very large as of yet.  
As for being physically barred from bank property - I'm kind of at a loss there.  I haven't seen anything like that from the bank I work for and it does seem over the top.  The worst that I thought could happen was that you get a file with ChexSystems and it makes it near impossible to open a bank account at a major bank for the next 5 years.

No, because they're going to wonder why you opened 100 accounts lol. usually the probationary period is 3 months so after that you should be fine.

Personal bank in a Big 4 bank here - yea we are instructed to file a report for anything that looks or feels suspicious after opening the account or performing a wire transfer.  The back office then makes a decision as to what to do with the account.  Wires in particular are highly scrutinized :(. I always feel weird having the question the customer what the wire is for because I don't feel that its really any of my business, but we do have to ask certain questions to protect the bank.  It's actually really surprising how many people actually come into the bank trying to do illegal shit or trying to rip us off somehow.
