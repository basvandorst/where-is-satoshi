No. If you have over a few hundred dollars I would reccomend getting a hardware wallet like a Ledger Nano X. Its pricey but worth it if you dont want to lose your coins. At the bare minimum I would reccomend at least a mobile wallet like Mycelium to at least gain control of your keys. It's still vulnerable, but the coins actually belong to you. Please look at the wallet options on bitcoin.org for better options.

I did. On galaxy s10+ it uses the wide angle lens that doesn't really focus well on barcodes. Theres a place where you can send them a message and they'll email you back. They will request a selfie as well as a picture of the front and back of your ID with the barcode on the back clear enough to be scanned.

Took then about a day to get back to me. Ended up not going through with it and sticking with coinbase

I feel like his account got compromised and someone made up the whole 4-tweet-post just to get people to fall for the stupid ass airdrop scam. That or he's just that fucking desperate
Edit: just saw that the account that posted the link to that is not McAfee's actual account. Whoops. Easy to mistake if you aren't paying full attention.

Maybe I'm missing something with lightning though, is there a way to raise the amount of the channel, or when it's at capacity do you just have to close it and open another?

No worries! Waiting on mine to come in the mail right now.

Finally a reliable prediction!

How though? The only way I see that happening is through a centralized source that has payment channels open with a ton of businesses, which kind of defeats one of the main benefits of bitcoin. I really like the idea of your wallet being similar to a savings account and lightning like a checking, but unfortunately at this current layer, I dont think that would be possible.

This ones pretty good, perhaps you could add the ability to start on a specific date, and a more specific length of investment.

The apps are just the different wallet types you can have on there. Each currency needs it's own specific wallet.

I've been looking for something like this,  would be awesome to use

I hope it happens! Accumulation time baby!
@_date: 2019-08-13 12:06:50
I dont know if I can say with 100% certainty that I wouldn't. I think I might get nervous, but I would probably still be accumulating all the way down. I would definitely be checking market dominance every morning.

I really hope it falls to $8,500. Discount BTC would be nice after all this $11k+. Good luck!
