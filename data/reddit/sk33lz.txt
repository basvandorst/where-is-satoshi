Doh! I got excited as I thought of a good one for hitting $88/BTC :/

Great idea, but the website is merely an HTML site with a contact form, so I might make a website for doing this also. The domain I wanted was already taken though, so I will have to think of something else.

1 Bitcoin is currently worth $47.90.  I'd say things are working out pretty well.

This is a very good use for Bitcoins, as Paypal and most other payment processors will charge a transaction fee regardless if you are donating all the money for something unless you are a fully registered 501c organization.

Newegg.com and Tigerdirect.com are awfully similar websites too. One was created 5 whole months after the other existed. The newer one, NewEgg, must be a scam then right? I buy 99% of my hardware from NewEgg, so I beg to differ.

This just in... Nike and Adidas both make sneakers! Competition is usual in a growing marketplace, which creates further growth in most cases, so what's the big deal here? 
You want Bitcoin usage to grow or die? I see competition growing in this market. Sink or swim!

I think everyone is a bit more tech-savvy, so things like this come naturally.
