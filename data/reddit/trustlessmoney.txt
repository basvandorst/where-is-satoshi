Well, it actually has survived, it totally lost the battle, blockstream won the complete war and is in total control of  bitcoin-(core).  
.  
A coin  with a DAO structure, is much beter suited to handle all these types of problems. Prime example is the first ever created DAO and still running DAO of Dash.

I am pretty amazed how wel Roger Ver keeps his cool for most of the time. Personally I have quit bitcoin-core for some time, the never ended discusions with no end, seriously what the point what do you guys even win by this ?  
  
Okay sure I have some heated discussions from time to time when voting for a new proposal for Dash, but once the voting is done it's over.  
   
But to each his own i guess

It may or may not, but it will make more complicated. Because you will now both have fee's for setting up a channel (which requires a at least one main chain transaction confirmation, so plan ahead if you planning to buy a cup of coffee). You'll have to pay fee's within the channel as well. And while you have the channel open your coins are looking in the channel, so make sure you also have enough coins for each channel you have open.

No that's totally incorrect Dash instant takes less than 3 seconds. I am just here to help you understand you can choose what you want. None the less I'll spend bitcoin with 0-conf anywhere that dumb enough to accept it, with 10 minutes and full blocks I can easily do double spend :).  I just think it's better to avoid it.

Wrong there is more debt than there is money.  
When banks create new money, they create the money\+intrest.  The intrest must be paid but the intrest is not created, the only way to repay the loan is to create, more money, aka new loans, the new loan repay's the old loan, but the new loan needs to be repaid as well, so you need to create again an new loan.  That's also why the economy must never stop growning or else, this also why inflation is needed, and this is also why debt's constantly increase.

Segwit was a soft\-fork, it's inferior to a hard\-forked version of segwit, it weakened the security model of bitcoin core considerably..It also forced people that did not want it to happen to accept it, normally if you don't want change you stay on the old chain.
Nor  does this have anything to do with decentralization, because this is what the blockstreamers wanted, plenty of including the person appointed by the creator of the project itself \(Satoshi\) prefeert to increase the blocksize.   Normally when you have a discussion you compromise if you both want something a hardfork of segwit with 4mb block would have gotten implemented quit quickly.  Also all honest discussions which previously took place on r/bitcoin  got deleted time and time again, if you suggested anything different than  segwit as a softfork
Best example of non messy decentralized decision\-making is the Dash DAO, it manage to decide to increase block\-size within 24hours of voting.

First response, you are now completely turning it around, I said: "you can't stop anyone from sending from a segwit address, which you can't and you have refuted it so it stands.
Second response you just saying the same thing again, you are  FORCED to use the segwit client if you want the full blockchain.

No, the incentive to give the wrong data will result in broadcasting the old state, which would than be see as punishable offence, if the node fails for it (it seems you and your up-voters would) they would lose there coins as punishment, hence the reason why your not getting the right signal.
@_date: 2018-03-26 21:03:38

My journey started with bitcoin, and I still hold it from time to time, I still see it as a store of value, do I take a very cautious wait and see approach until more is clear with the upcoming segwit2x (Mostly because the damage the lack of hash-rate can do)
I actively trade many different coins, 10+ coins most of the time. But I only trade coins that I believe have a future. It was quite a bit of work to get here and to maintain it, as I try to learn about all the top 250 coins per marketcap at any given time.
After a long and continue analyse for me Dash has been the clear winner as the go crypto currency for use as a store of value, and everyday use, but it will take at least a couple of years.  That is why my largest portion is in dash, but rest assured I would switch in a heartbeat if a better crypto will come to to town.

If it would be possible and worth my time I would take you and everybody else to court, and ask a substantial financial retribution. But at-least we still have some crypto-currency with fully transparent block-chains, so at least no lies there (one of the things I loved about bitcoin pre-segwit)
Also, why pump coins ? why not invest into coins that sometimes to add and offer to the World. I often de-invest and invest into other crypto's. It's stupid to do otherwise.

@_date: 2017-10-23 13:23:49
The main 10 features why i prefer dash:
1) Lowest fee's of all the top currency currently, including there instant sent and private sent.  Soon to be lower by a factor of 10
2) Instant send, only crypto currency that offers near instant confirmed transactions, thanks to it fully decentralized second tier network, making it possible to do in person transactions, without the possibly of double spend attacks.
3) privacy is optimal, and is not at the cost of transparency, aka remove the trustless part of the blockchain
4) There Governace and funding model is a stroke of genius, do few people fully understand it's potential.  One thing that noticeably proved it's power was the vote on increase of blocksize for 1 to 2mb in less than 24hours
5) Blocks can get as big as they want, because the network incentives (master)-full nodes. to run.
6) Dash labs is working on hardware solutions, similar to asic's but for transactions, so to make sure it can scale up to visa levels on the main blockchain
7) The blockchain is fully accesable via the api layer, that communicates with the network (so not just one single full-node).
8) Dash evolution will offer paypal like ease of use, coinbase currently would come the most close to it but, ofcourse dash will be decentralized and trust-less unlike coinbase
9) You'll be able to setup an account with a name, instead of public keys, you could for example make an account with your email, or phone number. or company name
10) In time interest baring accounts will come, that will offer intrest+ the ability to be part of the voting proces (currently only Masternode owners have that voting power)
There is lot's more to say but I thought 10points to be allot already.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:44:12
There is lot's of different places to find info.
Personally, I always like youtube video's, and thx to Amanda Dash has quite a few interesting ones to watch:
How Does Dash Offer Instant &amp; Private Payments? | DASH School 
As far as privacy tech goes, it's important to note, that dash, chooses to be both private and transparent. This means the blockchain, is still 100% view-able, which makes the blockchain trust-less (you would see any funny business going on straight away).  Furthermore it needs to be to scale, and not in any way retroactively reversible.  The fact of the matter is other privacy coins scale less well. Dash it's privacy model has also never been broken unlike some other coins, that claimed to be more private but where not for quite some time.
If how ever you wish to have a higher level of privacy, there are better out there, but for me that price is to high, because of the risk of back-doors or bugs, that make it possible that there are more coins printed in secret. And this not theorical it actually happend it the past but luckily this bug was found in time.
Basic explanation of private send:
For starters the current privacy model of dash is at the basic level nothing else than mixing, lets say 10 people have each 1 piece of gold, now all 10 put there piece of gold in a pot, shake that pot and than the same 10 people take out one gold piece each. Which gold piece belongs to who ? there is no way of knowing that any more, and you can do that same form of mixing as many times as you like. Simply put you now have plausible deniability+ the fact that your holdings will be split up into a 100 small pieces, so the next time you send a transaction.
Dash it's main goal is to become, globally use digital cash payment platform, this means that do there are other privacy features on there way Dash will never sacrifice more privacy at the cost of other needed functions such as transparency or scaling.   I personally belief this the best path forward, I don't even hold any other crypto because of the fear of hidden printing of extra coins, and the level of privacy is more than acceptable to me.
On the matter of the Goverance model, is a how different beast, the DAO like structure is something completely new, if you wish to learn more about it, I would say ask questions in the Dash Discord channel. You'll probably get lots of different answers. Your basically take part in philosophy about how to govern a cryptocurrency. 
At a very basic level I can say this about it. Every one with a stake gets a vote, and the vote cuts both ways. If they make the wrong one there coins will lose value, if they make the correct vote it will gain them value. So this increasily removes the chance for wrong do'er do do wrong because, trolls, fudders, evil bankers, only have a say once they invest, and the will lose there investment if they choose to actively vote incorrectly. 
When I look at how well it has worked for Dash compared to Bitcoin(I would like to see similar structure in bitcoin, do I am not sure it still be build in), it seems to work very well, but there are still plenty of things to improve on. The dash community welcomes hard questions and even better good suggestions how to improve.
@_date: 2017-10-31 15:39:59
Your correct that cash settlements are preferred, but this not the case for btc.
For example think if it like this what if you could choose between a commodity that it both not liquid, has costs of transport and has a delivery time and the global supply fluctuates. 
But now enter bitcoin, it's both very liquid and it has a limited supply, let's say your a whale and you bought 10.000 btc for price X, now look at the order-books for bitcoin on exchanges, what do you think will happen if you settle in btc ? The amount of coins in btc is the same but the value in USD is considerably higher.

Your title is widely inaccurate, and is completely and totally biased.
As for the article do at first glance to unsuspecting eyes is correct. The core of the problem is blockstream and it has been the major problem about 4 years now. 
Those of use that have not diged deep enough its simply clear we need to stick with CORE ! but the truth is that your sticking with blockstream, aka AXA aka a big old school legacy fiat bank, that greatly benefits and negatives and or slowdowns which have already happened. Their grip will only grow more over time.
Of-course people will say, Tinfoil hat and so fourth, but the truth is the original bitcoin creator had a tinfoil hat on as well, because well you know he concluded because of what happened in 2008 with big banks and all. But I am not addressing people that "believe" that current bitcoin-core is pure and good.  I am saying this to others that may see it as well, but do the future may be lost for bitcoin, it's certainly is not for crypto. What bitcoin glad in protection against this hostile attack is not lacking in DASH, it DAO structure is immune to this type of take offer.

That just a load of BS, simply look at the chart, it proofs blocks are full, transaction cost, are way above what people are willing to pay for a transaction fee, unless there doing very large or difficult to do transaction, both are niches.
Ask anybody that did some actual transactions, for daily use (including me, but is stopped and I am patiently waiting for Dash, to pick up this roll) It stopped working, and we needed bigger blocks regards-less if you wanted fancy tech, you should the very least give the users that actually used bitcoin where it was intended for, to use it. and a simple increase to 2mb or 4mb would have giving you atleast a half year maybe even a year, 8mb 2 years, to do your thing.
If you read the whitepaper, and understand the vision of btc that made it what it is today, than can only conclude that your the hijacker, forcing laughable small blocks on use.
But to you i say, keep it and I'll sadly watch it burn, while invest my energy and time to promote a currency that actually works as it should aka Dash

At the risk of stating the obvious -- the argument is not really about replay protection, but about which chain gets the business of un-upgraded light wallets.
If Segwit2X has majority hashrate and doesn't add replay protection (current plan) then the existing wallets automatically go with them. Core is left with no hashrate and no users.
If Segwit2X adds replay protection, un-upgraded wallets stay with the Core chain. In order to hop on the Segwit2X chain, wallet software needs to upgrade, and each individual wallet user needs to upgrade. There's much inertia with these things, and the upgrade would be likely slow and gradual. Like Segwit adoption currently. This is Core's only hope to survive -- retain some of the users who don't care or cannot upgrade, and then they have at least something to attract the hashrate.

lol, currency was introduced way before than, and currency does not fall under capital gains tax, and bitcoin is a currency, so it been incorrectly classified.

He never said that it never would be, he has no problems and in fact is for anything that benifits the bitcoin cash network

The real question is did he double spend it ? or did he have to wait 10 minutes for the confirmation ?

I get what Roger Ver is trying to do, but taking pictures with fake satoshi, that seems very dumm. Fake Satoshi does not deserve credit anywhere.

No there is plenty of hardware power, but bitcoin is hard-coded to stay on 1mb block's with some extra room up to a total of 4mb if your willing to use segwit transactions

Yes it does, if you don't get it is a fake democrazy

Looks like bad fake picture to me (look at elbow Roger Ver, sharp line, and skin color chains that comes with it).

If a crypto is a currency, than you should use it, do you pay the same taxes when you use USD ? Nope, you don't have to tell them unless you accept your slave masters rules.
@_date: 2018-04-16 15:49:56
Good for them, this is the tax equal to holding currency ? and did you vote for this tax ? If these are both no than you don't live in a democracy. If you choose to live in a country that does not have democracy, well good for you if not, you should not pay for this theft !

please provide link and info about your country that people voted for special tax on currency that is crypyto, but we are talking about the IRS which is for the USA, which is illegally takes people that hold a different form of currency. My country does not have a different taxation for crypto, so I don't have to hide

Apparently the truth hurts, and it's pain-level is counted in down-votes.  (thank you for posting the truth)

In other words, it very old and it could have been an honest mistake.  Pretending otherwise is clear attempt of character 
 assassination. Something this channel and bitcoin-core and blockstream are quit familiar with
