Not done checking, but this looks similar to a phishing scam link I clicked a couple months ago.

And then usership will grow, and somebody just like you will post a comment saying "If we increase the block size to 12 MB right now It'll clear out the mempool in 6 hours."
Repeat a few times, and suddenly nodes can only run in data centers.

I can't help but wonder if the fact that there were two huge donations is a hint that this was the Winklevoss twins.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:33:13
Too many tradeoffs? What does that mean?
@_date: 2018-05-22 17:15:31
This is stupid. You don't know what 100% adoption of bitcoin is, so you can't graph relative to that.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:46:05
This seems like something they're sending out to tons of people hoping to find some that actually have twins. Contact the police immediately. (Also, nobody try to be a good samaritan by sending money to this address as it might be a distress scam.)

Same thing applies for links posted in this sub. I was scammed out of 1.2 BTC by a link to a fake mining hardware retailer. I wonder what the general solution to this problem is. Even when I booked a hotel with bitcoin on expedia.com I wondered what assurance I had that they wouldn't just take the money and give me nothing.
@_date: 2017-02-04 19:47:57
It gives the message credibility when someone gets it who actually has twins.
@_date: 2016-06-11 13:53:15
It was a sponsored ad, which would have been the first red flag if I had actually noticed.

I'll probably give some to family members, maybe keep one at work, etc. This is for long term storage so it doesn't need to be imminently accessible.

I already fell for it. Goodbye 2.125 BTC :(
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:45:55
I did. I got the development version of electron cash off of github, which had a fix for multisig.
Sent all my BTC out of my old wallet, which leaves the BCC behind (because of replay protection). Then loaded old wallet into electron cash.
@_date: 2017-01-09 00:33:09
I've actually been calling this a horcrux wallet ;)

56% married or in a relationship =/= "married"
39% of PEOPLE are probably 25-34
43% employed =/= employed
There is nothing generous about purchasing legal goods.
I think the only one you got right here is male.
Great chart. It was 12% worth my time.

My btc is stored in a multisig electrum wallet. Electron cash doesn't support multisig yet. Is there any way I can retrieve my bcc?
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:46:57


I was able to load a multisig electrum wallet by downloading the development version of electrum cash off of github.
Do at your own risk.

The only software I've downloaded that claims to be electrum was from the electrum official site. I also downloaded electron cash.
@_date: 2018-07-03 06:17:16
This is dumb. I could just as easily show you all the times it shot up and make the opposite claim.

He can actually go to jail for this.

Probably true. However, another unreliable and dangerous entity is Wikileaks.

I don't blame him for not understanding this yet. The outside world is still coming to grips with the fact that there is no faith; that's the whole point.

It is NOT a "messy process of peer review."
Craig has failed to produce the ONLY, SIMPLE, ONE-STEP PROOF. THAT'S IT! No more discussion or obfuscation needed!!

Why not? This runs on 1.4KW. Where I live, electricity is 6 cents per KWh. 1.4KW * 24h * 30days * $0.06/KWh = $60.48 in electricity per month. According to online bitcoin calculators as well as the product page's estimate table, 14TH/s gets you about $566.56 per month on average. Am I missing something?

Ohhh maaannn guyyyyysssssssss. He was JUST about to move a genesis coin. Why did we have to be so meeeeeaaaaan.
@_date: 2016-05-03 01:00:04
I think he would have to be an idiot not to expect such a request. We're talking about the only tool necessary for the test. Of course he would have a ringer ready if at all possible.

It is easy to make a computer look "factory-sealed." Wright's assistant probably went and retrieved a computer he'd prepared for this demonstration. I'm surprised Gavin used the hotel's wi-fi as the example point of failure when this would be so much easier.

No they didn't. They said he provided evidence.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:50:03
Or maybe just do the thing everyone is asking you to do. Even if a known satoshi coin moves today, it proves nothing.

Can confirm the setup was more of a pain than expected. However it has the advantage of being much cheaper for large-n multisig wallets. You can buy a dozen cheap flash drives and have a 7 of 12 scheme or something, which would cost a lot to do with 12 trezors.
@_date: 2017-06-18 20:55:32
I use a raspberry pi zero to run a multisig electrum wallet, the keys for which are stored on several flash drives hidden in various places. It's not as convenient as a Trezor probably, but it works well enough. I retrieve enough flash drives to sign a transaction, cosign with them one by one, and produce a QR code onscreen that I can then scan and broadcast from my phone.
