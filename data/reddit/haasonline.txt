Yesterday i have released the new version of the Simple Trade Bot. I am now at version 0.8.5.2 Beta. This version solves a few bugs i got back the past week.  All the registered users have got a mail from me with instructions how to upgrade to the new version.
For full details about the changes please to to the change log of the Simple Trade Bot on my website.
I also released some new pages for the help (not all yet), they can also be found at my website, at the help of the software. I guess the most intresting page i have published in my help is about setting good bot parameters. I have shown some little tricks and tweaks there what you can do to find some good parameters to use.
I hope this version will provide everybody with more profits then the previous version i released. 
Please use my new support ticket system at my website in case you encounter a bug or problem. I am moving from the simplebot -email to the usage of the support ticket system.
Happy coin earning everybody!

I have added a new page to my website. The page is called "Promotions" and everybody should be able to take a look if i have active promotions. Using the promotions you can earn a discount of the software.
