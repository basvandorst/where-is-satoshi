Luckily the network was so congested with spam and the loss of hash power meant that off-exchange coins were unable to be traded.

The stock seems to not move with the market; and it seems to be held largely by institutions.  It will work it's way back to 48, but if you got in there, it's been a wild ride.

Their cash app already lets you purchase BTC.  There's no order book and I believe they build in a fee to cover transaction costs.  But why would they want to reinvent the wheel?  They're way more innovative than building another exchange.
They're likely going to allow Cash customers and Square POS customers interact using BTC.

That's not what I heard on the conference call.  That headline is fake news.
What isn't fake is that Square is on the path to fully embrace Bitcoin.  It sounded like to me that they want to add the ability to spend Bitcoin using their Square cash app and their point-of-sale application.  I listened to Sarah Frier today on MSNBC and she said that they hold Bitcoin to provide liquidity to Cash.  And they have a dedicated team to Bitcoin at Square.
But I haven't heard anything about building out a full-scale exchange.  And that doesn't seem to line up with the direction they're taking their business.
However, if they could facilitate transactions using BTC with technology they already have, bonus.  It'd be a win for SQ and a win for BTC.
