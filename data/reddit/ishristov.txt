Yes, if the symbols are missing at the end I am only searching for {missing symbols} - 4.

1 is enough [

The logic is that that if you have the private key, you can generate the public address (this works only one way).  
So, it just gets the incorrect private key you have and starts changing its symbols until some of those variations can generate the public address that you know is associated with this private key. If it does - you have found the original private key. No need to download the blockchain.

I don't think so. We'd need something else entirely but the chance of success would be super slim. Only if the password was something really generic and common a brute force would work imo. But I haven't seen such tool.

You could say that it's true. But there still might be some Bitcoin forks which could be recovered from the private key. But yeah.. if we recover the key, sweep the wallet immediately, wait for confirmation and don't care (or have) any forks, you are good to go.

Have you read the readme with the how-to or the code? I've provided instructions how to prevent any malicious actions.
You can download it locally and test with the provided examples OFFLINE. The source is open, see it for yourself.

Thank you!
Everyone (and this is written in the README) - it's best to turn off your internet before restoring your keys, deleting the project afterwards and restarting your computer before turning on your internet again. Every tool is as safe as the way it's handled.

I'm also currently working on a way to restore 7-8-9 chars if they are missing from the end of the key.
Edit: update
\- the tool now restores up to 8-9 chars if missing at the end.
\- it works with both compressed (52 chars, starts with "K" or "L") and uncompressed (51 chars, starts with "5") WIF private keys.
\- recovering 4 missing takes &lt; 5 minutes and recovering 8 missing at the end takes &lt; 10 minutes.
Good luck!

Maybe at some point, but I don't have much time so it's not worth the effort for me at this point.

Wow, I keep getting downvotted. I guess that's people who charge for similar tools and services. :)

That's why the advice is "Download the code -&gt; turn off your internet -&gt; run the code and find the key -&gt; sweep the wallet with a mobile wallet -&gt; remove the tool -&gt; restart computer -&gt; turn on computer. Even if your computer (or the tool) is compromised, you would find the key and transfer the funds to another (presumably safe wallet) before anything bad has a chance to happen.

And yet my real github and identity are provided. If you find a real issue with the code I'll happily talk about it. I'm just a software developer trying to help and earn some btc tips. Nothing more, nothing less.
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:05:54
Yeah, that is good suggestion, thank you. I am actually using something similar  for my latest addition (not available yet) - finding missing up to 8 chars at the end of the key. I will look more into it.
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:34:52
Thanks for the thorough feedback. Maybe I should have used my old throwaway reddit account but wanted to start from scratch with real identity. Cheers.
@_date: 2018-12-30 21:15:54
I guess so, but I will probably invest in this only when there's a particular need for it. I want to finish restoring the key at the end (with up to 8-9 missing chars) and then make the whole thing work with uncompressed WIF wallets as well.
@_date: 2018-12-31 15:08:12
Well what I'm doing here is mostly about recovering a private key generated from bitaddres.org or similar tools in the early days. If one has a HD wallet, they probably don't work with public and private keys but with seeds which is a whole different game.
@_date: 2018-12-30 18:37:18
Great, let me know if you run into issues.
@_date: 2018-12-31 07:39:43
Bad or good, it works, gets the job done and can be used easier that what you are suggesting. I never said I'm writing a javascript masterpiece.
Of course, if you don't think it's pretty and doesn't adhere to your high standards, you are completely free to write a similar, more beautiful tool, that is also free for anyone to use. Cheers.

Haha, thanks! :)
