You're right, morons like you should NEVER attempt to create a brain wallet. After all.. you have to have a functioning brain to do it.

I don't believe you.
@_date: 2014-07-24 23:05:28
If you want the tor network to be faster and better maybe you should think about running an exit node and/or contributing to the project. Open source projects are everyone's responsibility to improve. Take the initiative. You just explained why it's important, so do it.
@_date: 2014-08-27 16:54:08
I just signed up today and got one. I guess you shouldn't have waited.

@_date: 2014-06-02 18:19:05
I would add it to the pile ;)
@_date: 2014-07-24 18:40:22
Thanks Urkle! Can you please tell me more about how you think you do everything the right way and everyone else is stupid and how nobody ever understands you because you're sooo much smarter and more thoughtful than they are and maybe talk a bit about how your opinion of things and the ways they should work is superior to all us retarded monkeys who, honestly, can only dream of momentarily grasping your lofty ideas and concepts before sliding quickly back into a default drooling stupor?
Thanks! You rule.

Tor has steadily gotten faster and more reliable over the last couple years. I use Tor all the time. I'm using it right now. It might be a little slower at the beginning of a request but it speeds up and, for me at least, is not even an issue 99% of the time. Sometimes when it drags I might copy and paste a link into chrome.. but even youtube videos play perfectly these days over Tor.. that was never the case for me in the past. Tor has been greatly improved and will continue to be as more people add exit nodes to the network.
(oh yeah.. btw, Reddit treats you like shit if you're using Tor to interact with their site. It will only let your post one comment every 8 minutes or so from any single Tor IP address... but you can pretty much just spawn a new identity and you're fine)
