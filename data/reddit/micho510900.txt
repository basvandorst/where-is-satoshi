Cause mods are deleting everything negative about Bitcoin. And this post made it though somehow, so mods seems to be sleeping right now.

I payed today 24$ on segwit wallet, so still crazy and still it didn't confirmed in first block, but the second one.

RemindMe! 7 days "What happened to the drive with BTC"

I was in similar situation, but with eth, i invested into BAT when it was high, GOLEM, NEO and TENX when it was also "high" (-60%). 2 months of waiting and here we go (+600%). You still might get out with profit, patience.

Wow, now you talking. But couple days ago every bitcoin maximalist was saying that Bitcoin is used as a store of value and not as a currency. What happened to that statements?

Do you believe in your technology? I mean it's 1mb block and high fees with slow confirmations, and it's going to be like that for the next 18 months. Personally I don't, and I didn't when Bitcoin community rejected every upgrade proposal, that's why I sold at 7300. I have no plans to going back until Bitcoin will be fast again, and that... looking at the past might never happend. We are at the same place we were 2 years ago. Only thing changed is price, now it's going back to the place where it should be. But that's just my opinion.

It is noone here cares about technology, everyone is trying to pump the bubble. Memepool shows how bad it really is, the price courtine is doing its thing, but it will fail eventually making the bubble pop. From technological standpoint, bitcoin is still in 2014.

You cant even spell Ethereum properly, and it's 360 already btw.
