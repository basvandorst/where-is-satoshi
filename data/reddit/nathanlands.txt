Do you really think that's the case for your average person? :) 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:08:15
Awesome! This sounds like a commercial lol. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:25:20
Perhaps, altho we want to be much more than a tip bot:) Altho that's definitely a use case that exists which our product serves very well. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 22:30:35
Hey Jeff. What part of the transaction history is incomplete? I'll look into it. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 18:14:25
Plenty:  Please read my previous comments on other Reddit threads, we're likely the most transparent bitcoin company out there. Our entire team has reputations in San Francisco tech, my wife has restaurants in the city which we've had Bitcoin events at such as the Bitcoin Fair. We invite people out to meet us in person which I haven't seen the other wallets doing, and we'll be doing more of that in the future. We're not going anywhere:) 
@_date: 2014-08-21 18:20:07
That was our first version. This is the second version(entirely new core, UI framework, etc.). 
It's a major release which sets the next stage of our growth, thus "Introducing". 
We will be using Introducing for all major releases, not minor ones. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:54:17
Setting up ZenDesk now. That will be on /support or support.quickcoin.co. It will give the ability to submit tickets, FAQ that the community will help generate, as well as provide info about how to contact us. We'll link ZenDesk to our GitHub so that we can escalate issues that are real bugs to be fixed by the dev team.
We'll be available from 9am to 5pm PST Monday-Saturday on  on irc.freenode.net as well as by support via ZenDesk. 
Thanks guys for being patient and sorry for not already having our support setup properly:) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:44:31
By the way, so far from what we're seeing on our end, your BTC is still there. This may be a presentation/UI issue. Checking in more detail now. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 20:07:45
We'll be creating a tech blog(it'll be located at  in a week or so and posting about the tech, security as well as keeping weekly release notes. 
@_date: 2014-02-10 18:53:59
Will do. We did this one so fast, didn't really have a lot of time to promote it. We'll share all of the future ones on reddit and bitcointalk etc. way ahead of time. We're hoping to make it either a monthly event or a quarterly event. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:10:21
Too bad we couldn't make it to New York, hope it went well! 
If any engineers / designers are looking for work and are in San Francisco or willing to move, we're hiring at QuickCoin! :) Big new updates to our product and announcements on the way. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 21:01:32
At the moment our business model is a bit of an afterthought. We're entirely focused on making the user experience amazing and building out  products with real use cases because we want to see people start using bitcoin more in their daily lives. 
Rest assured tho, our team has a lot of experience raising money and with this product really expect to be able to bring in quality investors who will give us the time to figure out the business model in a way that isn't rushed. We care about our users and giving them a quality experience and providing value. If we provide real value, there will be ways to make money. :) 
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:06:05
For security reasons, we currently do not allow the exporting of your private key. Keep in mind, what we're building is a lot more of a mainstream application than bitcoin wallets of the past and there are MAJOR phishing concerns to be thought through. So altho we do want to have this feature in the future, and plan on having it, we are making sure to do it the right way. 
Rest assured, we will have "Advanced Settings" for hard-core bitcoin users, but it will be presented in such a way that doesn't interfere with the main user experience and also has warnings about entering the settings as well as other anti-phishing methods. 
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:46:42
We've just created a "Quick Support" page at  where users can submit support tickets / bug reports. Users can also ask questions in the community and there will be a Knowledge Base / FAQ. 
Also, we've added a "Chat with us" option on every page of the website that will bring you to live chat with us. 
Thanks for being patient! We're working hard to get our customer service in line:) 
@_date: 2014-06-09 18:27:30
 we'll be adding more ways to use QuickCoin in the following weeks &amp; months :) For bitcoin to reach the mainstream, we've got to reach people where they're at and well, Facebook is the largest platform in the world!
Additionally, if Facebook ever did take us down for some reason(they've made a public statement that makes it sound as if they're completely fine with what we're doing), your funds would be safe so it's not as if your bitcoin is tied to Facebook! Just think of it as a vehicle to help spread bitcoin all around the world.
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:23:37
Thanks:) Welcome to Reddit!
@_date: 2014-05-23 18:09:26
Well it does show the flow from start to end:) you're right tho, it's not a full product demo. We'll make a video in a day or so and put it up on /learn and share it. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:59:12
 is correct. Even if Facebook banned us, which hopefully won't happen but is always possible, users would not lose their bitcoin. We've made sure of that! 
It's important to note that we've built this entire system in a modular way where there is a core to QuickCoin that can be re-used in many ways and also we're not tied just to Facebook. So altho at the moment we look like "Bitcoin on Facebook", we're building a whole lot more than that and this is a stepping stone. :) 
With that being said, hopefully Facebook allows us to keep pushing forward because well obviously Facebook is the  way that bitcoin can actually reach most of the people of the world. 
A pretty high level person at Facebook seen our app today via wall posts. I sent him some bitcoin and he was loving it. Actually his response was the most over the top positive response I've heard yet:) Hopefully that's some indicator of how others will respond at the company. Regardless, our user's bitcoin will be safe.
@_date: 2014-05-23 16:25:10
Hey everyone, I was just made aware of this post. We'll be answering any and all questions to the best of our ability and already have our team looking over this situation to see what's going on. 
Before promoting QuickCoin we have of course did many tests to make sure nothing like this would happen and have yet to find any major issues like the one you're talking about. We also have automated tests as well as manual testing scripts we run before each deployment.
Thanks for being patient and letting us look into this! We'll be responding as soon as we've identified exactly what's going on. 
I'm sure we'll add a support button to the app soon as well! For now, you can email admin and that comes to us flagged as a bug report. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:02:24
 I'll have my partner and CTO respond to this in a bit, but yes we are definitely taking this very serious. We spent a lot of time before even developing this making sure that we have the right security in place. We'll continue to improve that security as well as being very transparent about our development. Looks can be deceiving and such a simple product can make someone guess that how things work behind the scenes are also simple. :) 
It's also important to note that we've even planned for what if's, such as "What if Facebook removed us?". Our entire system has been built in a modular way where we can easily work with other platforms(and will be soon), as well as if Facebook removed us your bitcoin would still be there and available. 
We'll be creating a tech blog that will be up at  in a few days, where we'll have weekly release notes as well as blog posts about our security and the technology going on behind the scenes. 
In the meantime, if you or anyone finds any bugs please let us know, we'll be giving out $5 to $10 in tips for unique bugs. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:43:13
 that's why we suggest people store their bitcoins in cold storage. QuickCoin is a wallet meant to be used, like the cash in your pocket. We're working on very cool stuff with merchants as well as other ways to use bitcoin -- once you see what all we're building, I believe you'll be willing to keep $100 in your QuickCoin wallet:) and if not, then we don't deserve to have you as a user. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:39:15
For anyone who reads this, we found the issue and are working to fix it. If your wallet is empty, you may not see content. As soon as you add bits, you'll see content. Thanks!
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:48:43
This question does not compute, because QuickCoin should be your real wallet.. ;) 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:56:15
You might be right. But I believe with what we're working on, that will change things. We have to of course build out good use cases for bitcoin, and make it so simple anyone can use it. I do believe once regular people are seeing their friends send them bitcoin for their birthday, or using it a restaurant in San Francisco or New York(for starters), things will change. It won't happen over night. We're building a company looking at 5+ years, imagining the things that helped make bitcoin go mainstream... and building them. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:06:07
Good point:) we'll be working on a demo video. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 20:36:16
 this was created as a tool for the bitcoin community to help spread bitcoin by showing it to people and making that as simple as possible.
So far we've made it where you can send with a Facebook message/wall post, and now we have where you can send to anyone you meet in person without needing to be Facebook friends(Nearby).
We'll be adding other login methods as well as our own identity system, and multi-sig. So for those who are concerned about it being Facebook only, we'll be addressing that -- however, it's worth noting that your "money" is in no way tied to Facebook. If Facebook was gone tomorrow, we'd still be able to give you your bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-07-17 21:23:33
 I shared the link on Facebook, about 5 friends of mine also shared the post and tweeted about it, so a lot of friends probably created an account to show support. I didn't ask anyone to comment. Nice detective work tho, I'm a big fan of Sherlock. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:15:13
P.S., so far, I've had some Facebook executives tell me they were amazed but what we've done. Actually the most positive Feedback I've heard yet came from a relatively high level executive at the company. Really hoping that sentiment gets shared across the company and we're allowed to continue using Facebook as a way to spread adoption of bitcoin across the world. :) 
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:24:24
No worries, we'll be doing tons more of them, and they'll be better:) The first one was simple networking event with focus on using bitcoins, primarily for Ramen + Beer. Future ones we'll have live music, entertainment, and a variety of ways to use bitcoins. Gonna be fun. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:52:03
I understand your concerns, however I'd like to stress that what we're building is not like anything that's been seen in the bitcoin world yet. I truly understand your concerns as there have been many scams with bitcoin. 
Please note that we are trying to help solve the problem of people getting ripped off by suggesting that users should store the majority of their bitcoin in cold storage. We'll be doing more and more to educate users about this over time. You shouldn't be putting more in any wallet out there than you'd put in your real wallet. 
In terms of trust, we're working hard to be a super transparent company that hopefully will even earn the trust of people who've been severely burned. Our entire team has reputations in tech, so I think that alone should show you that we're a bit different than some of the fly by night operations that have happened with unknown entities creating bitcoin companies. Our advisors include Jackson Palmer(Dogecoin creator) and Zach Klein(Vimeo co-founder). See our about page to see full team:  
Also we've been doing events in San Francisco at my wife's restaurant, and having people meet us in person. We realize some people have made people scared of bitcoin wallets, and we hope to correct that. I'd love to extend an invite to future events(we're working on plans for the next Bitcoin Fair) to have the community meet us in person! 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:07:15
This is our first version:) We're operating fast &amp; lean, rolling out new versions weekly. We'll be keeping weekly release notes on a tech blog soon.
@_date: 2014-05-24 00:57:48
We're building a whole lot more than a tip service. We'll be deploying updates weekly, lots of cool stuff on the way:) 
@_date: 2014-05-24 20:25:05
QuickCoin works on iPhone :)   [Full disclosure, i'm the CEO, and also an iPhone user]
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:47:25
@_date: 2014-02-10 05:56:04
Awesome, glad to hear! My wife is a partner at the restaurant. The chef is next to me right now, he's very happy to hear your comment about the quality:)
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:57:17
Thanks! :) We're working on other ways to use QuickCoin beyond just Facebook, however of course Facebook is the  way we can reach the people of the world. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:24:08
Wait till you see what's next;)
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:31:26

@_date: 2014-08-21 22:33:40
Totally understood, this isn't for everyone yet. We're just focused on doing one thing very well, and that thing right now is using QuickCoin as a kind of "gateway" into bitcoin that the community can use to help get people started and educate people. 
Right now, you can upgrade your security and have your own 3 phrase password on QuickCoin so even if someone had your Facebook account, they wouldn't have any access to your bitcoin. That takes you from security level 1 to 2. We're working on up to 5 levels of security. 
Hope that gives a little bit of clarity. We definitely need to do a lot on the education front to explain what our product does and how it works, so I appreciate the feedback which shows me we need to get better at explaining. :)
@_date: 2014-05-26 21:18:59
Exactly! We've been testing this internally. People are shocked(in a good way) to get bitcoin for their birthday:) I've had several friends from the game industry that were amazed and told me it was the first time they got bitcoin:)  Great feeling. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 18:07:57
No QR code reader at the moment. We're working on some very interesting alternative ways to do that;) 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:53:11
From what I've counted we're currently at 2 clicks when most other wallets are about 22 clicks. It's quiet a difference. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:44:44
By the way, we'll be working on a blog(it's extremely bare right now, working on it) at  where we hope to help educate people about the issues I mentioned and more. 
@_date: 2014-06-29 01:28:50
Thanks! Will do. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:54:37
Facebook is just step one. And I'd be quiet surprised if "this" already existed. We're focused on building beautiful products, and quiet frankly I haven't seen anything else that matches that in terms of a bitcoin wallet that's easy to use. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:38:04
Good luck I guess. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:11:48
Thanks! We're definitely open minded about alts, especially Doge, but no current plans as of yet, just focused on making our user experience amazingly simple.
We are building the core of our software in such a way where it's quiet easy for us to work beyond Facebook, beyond bitcoin etc. so I wouldn't be surprised if you see it added at some point or we have some spin-off experiment using our tech:) 
@_date: 2014-05-22 19:14:38
Oh we are, we're all fully dedicated to the success of QuickCoin:) we have 3 people, 2 amazing advisors, and looking to hire 2 more people in the next 1-2 months. What you see live right now is just a simple start, we have tons of amazing things in development, gonna be fun. 
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:38:43
I agree:) Better headline is needed, however I appreciate the excitement of the person who posted it.

For those who are curious, here is a photo album from the event: 
We'd love to have you all come to the next one:) You can like us on Facebook( or signup at  to be notified about future Bitcoin Fairs. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:55:10
That's awesome:) Thanks so much for sharing that, makes me feel great to hear stuff like this.
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:15:29
 sorry you feel that way. We're extremely passionate about what we've been working very hard on and want the whole world to try it of course:) 
With that being said, I want to make it clear that we didn't ask anyone to comment and we definitely didn't create accounts or anything like that. I'm sure some friends I shared the link with didn't have an account and made one just to help out. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:59:18
kk, we're on it. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 00:41:31
That's not exactly what we meant but thanks for bringing it up, is a great opportunity to explain it a bit better. There is a misunderstanding with lots of people who aren't power bitcoin users that think to get into bitcoin you need to spend a lot of money and also you should put it all in a "wallet". 
What many people are calling a wallet IMO is more akin to a bank account / vault. A wallet and a bank are VERY different things.
We believe that people should be putting the bitcoin they want to actually use &amp; spend(whatever you'd normally carry in cash in your pocket) in our QuickCoin wallet, and the rest should be in cold storage on a piece of paper(in a safe place). 
In regards to trusting us, please see our About Page and look at the Linkedin profiles of our team and our backgrounds,  We're good people, very public and have reputations. Our advisors which are good friends of our team include Zach Klein, the co-founder of Vimeo, and Jackson Palmer, the creator of Dogecoin. 
I've been in the video game industry for quiet a well, I signed the only contract ever with Icefrog(DotA co-creator), had a company with a large presence at E3 before, helped the legendary game designer David Perry(EWJ, TMNT etc.) with the initial strategy for Gaikai, I'm friends with the owners of most of the top League of Legends teams and coined the term gamify. Our other partner, William Cotton, has been a lead engineer on tons of awesome projects as well as being the 1st engineer @ Bleacher Report. 
My wife co-owns restaurants in San Francisco, and we have did 2 bitcoin events so far at her restaurant in Japan Town(Ramen Underground), including the Bitcoin Fair which was pretty big and had some good coverage. We're very public and invite people to come out and meet us at the events, and heck my baby is even usually around:) We've also just finished helping with a major bitcoin documentary that's supposed to be aired in 2 months on KBS, the  station in South Korea. 
Hope that helps you trust us a bit, and if you're ever out in San Francisco during one of our events I'd love to have you and anyone else in the community meet us!
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:37:53
Totally agreed, tho I think it's a bit elitist to consider people who don't understand bitcoin tech as dumb :) I've known people who have major degrees, and have sold large tech companies who don't get how it works.  Several of them said this was the first time they ever got bitcoin, by getting a message from me.
I think what we're building will most definitely have an impact on making bitcoin mainstream, which is good for everyone if you truly want to see crypto-currency change the world.
@_date: 2014-05-26 17:41:33
 we're working on that. Been working on some partnerships for the last 4 months, basically since our initial inception which happened over drinks at Ramen Underground in San Francisco:) Seeing some progress and I do believe we'll have easy in for bitcoin within 2-3 months, tho could take longer. 
For the next month we're focused entirely on people who already have bitcoin and showing people how you can use QuickCoin to help spread bitcoin to people to the non initiated. Next we're working on more specific use cases for using QuickCoin, as well as of course easy in(buying) and easy out(spending) :) 
@_date: 2014-05-23 01:16:47
I totally agree! I don't agree with how Apple does everything, but the reality is iOS is still extremely important and if you want bitcoin to reach the world, you've gotta be on it. 
@_date: 2014-05-22 23:26:51
Thanks so much! 
@_date: 2014-08-21 17:52:17
Can you try reloading and tell me if you're still having a problem? Also, if you can take a screenshot and send any info(like your browser type and version, etc.) to support and we'll get it figured out. Thanks for trying it out!

Hey everyone, just wanted to say that we've just created a "Quick Support" page at  where users can submit support tickets / bug reports. Users can also ask questions in the community and there will be a Knowledge Base / FAQ.

You make a great point, however I'd say that using QR codes is not real progress. Japan has been using them forever, it's an old thing.. not some new thing we should all be embracing.

We'll definitely be looking into this more as we move forward and have already been talking to legal a bit.

I left a response to someone else's comment that I think should be helpful in terms of making it clear we're a very transparent, public company with a good team that all have reputations here in San Francisco.

bitcoin blockchain
