Why not both? Store in cold storage for the long-term and pay for services/products and for day-to-day transactions.

I buy bitcoin bi-weekly regardless of the price.

That's cool! I would like to wish you a Happy Birthday and may all your dreams come true and we get a bull cycle soon! 
Thank you.

lol no I didn't sell everything I own to buy BTC. I don't buy 1 BTC every 2 weeks, much less than that :)

Thank you for sharing such an inspirational quote.

That's amazing. I don't know what it is (other than money) but sometimes I prefer cheap hostels than fancy hotels. Maybe they're more interesting? You have more stories/reddit posts to share after staying in them? 
Please, if you don't mind, can you share with us the fee you paid for the transaction? 
Thanks again.

Market cap lowest this year but BTC's dominance is the highest which is interesting. Everyone is expecting a pump in December and that's one of the reasons I don't expect one until next year. 
My cost average is looking better now so no ragrets.

According to my TA charts, I predict that in 2019 the price will either go up or down.
