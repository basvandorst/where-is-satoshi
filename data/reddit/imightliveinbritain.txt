That's exactly it though. I want to discuss bitcoin. not to hear some man-child go 'roflcopter btrash lolzor'. That just makes the community look immature.

There's a reason people think that this is just a community of crypto kiddies.

Nice one. Not even a single good argument just bs.
I'm not getting into bcssh likely ever but people like you are what make me thing even bitcoin isn't going to to anywhere.. This sub just seems to be fan boyish to the extreme sometimes.

I've just started putting money into Vanguard LifeStrategy 80 (which is for the UK investors primarily)

Nice excuse for acting like a moron.

You know... Calling it btrash really invalidates ant of your points. It just makes you seem childish and un objective

Good question.. I can't answer. I'm only just getting into such things. But that sort of return is amazing.

I went with h&amp;l because I can start off lower. I'll be moving to vanguard directly in April and just putting a fixed amount in.

Why do you say this?
I look at bitcoin with morbid curiosity. 99.9% of threads talk about it purely as an investment. It's actual use or value is rarely mentioned.
