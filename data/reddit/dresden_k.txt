Maybe. But many people are here because of the whitepaper. Because of the value statements that Satoshi outlined. There are a lot of engineers here who forget that engineers are not trained to produce that value, but to operationalize those values with, in this case, software. Satoshi's value statements are why a lot of people are here, so it's entirely coherent that we would reference him. Those referents are the reason we're not using some other cryptocurrency.

Left on our own with some text that coordinates us, yes. The project will evolve no doubt, but it started from that white paper. So if people start wanting to do something _wholly distinct_ from what that paper refers to, they ought to go work on something else.

Uhh, well if your argument is about whether GPU or CPU mining is "better", you're definitely going to win if you say GPU mining is better, for most algorithms. Except maybe an alt like Primecoin, which as far as I know, isn't GPU compatible. But for Bitcoin, yeah back in ... 2011 or something, a GPU was 10x better (or thereabouts) than a CPU for hashing. Now, though, no one uses a GPU or CPU for bitcoin mining. You'd lose money, because you'll use much more electricity than you'd make to pay for that electricity. People with specialized equipment (Application Specific Integrated Circuit - manufacturers like Bitmain or Spondoolies) now mine, and most of them don't really make much money, unless they're getting sub 7 cent electricity and their equipment is paid off... 
There are a bunch of mining/hardware calculators on the web, but it's difficult to project past right now because we don't know _exactly_ what difficulty levels will be or what the bitcoin price will be, as compared to the electricity costs...

I'll look this stuff up, sure. 
Solutions need to be available sooner rather than later, so perhaps I'll amend my earlier, short, comment... The problem with LFTRs is that they're not _quite_ ready to make them, _and_ governments (at least Western ones) seem reluctant to give them the time of day. Molten-salt cooled pebble bed burner reactors are ready to go, say within 3-5 years technologically speaking anyway. This, of course, contributes to problem  who would spent billions on R and D when a regulatory body could just say "no, sorry, you don't get an operating license" once they've built the reactor plant. So there's a definite first-mover disadvantage with either fusion or alternate/"new" forms of fission. 
I'm sure there's garbage in my mind about the state of fusion, though. I'll grant that. Thanks for pointing this stuff out to me. 
I'd also add that we (society, globally) will probably need more than one 'solution' at the same time. This is due to a number of things, but the heterogeneous nature of different countries' regulatory environments will mean some people will be big on molten salt reactors, some will go for fusion, some will do mostly geothermal, some will try solar/gas or wind/gas, and overall, maybe by some miracle we'll be able to stop dumping 35 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere each year. I'll be pleased if one day in my lifetime we're able to accurately claim that we don't have a 1.8 trillion gigaton atmospheric carbon dioxide backlog...

Yeah, with half a million doge at the time, much wow. What if Bitcoin was 10% of M1? Wow. I'm fascinated by the project, and I buy bitcoin on a regular basis - I even spend it some times - but I'm not holding my breath for million dollar bitcoins. The "magic", if you'll excuse the choice of words, of bitcoin is already happening. I can send non-counterfeitable value to anyone, any time, provided we both have cell phones (and there are lower-tech ways to do this, too...)... That's pretty amazing by itself.

I think mining must always be profitable. 
Here's why. Suggest improvements to my logic as you discover them. 
Miners must mine to make bitcoin work - it's what secures the validity of the transactions and orders them in to blocks. Without miners, there is no bitcoin network. Miners also help process transaction fees. 
If the price of bitcoin goes low enough that large operations of bitcoin mining can no longer pay their electricity bills vs. what they're mining, and/or as the price approaches this point they may hold thinking they'll be able to make back the offset later. Or, they turn their equipment off, and stop mining. 
The effect of miners-holding will be fewer bitcoins for sale that day/week/month, and the price, I think, will increase due to a lack of supply. 
Mining altcoins can be much more profitable than mining bitcoin but it is also a lot more volatile, and you'll have to get used to switching which coin you're using. Check coinwarz.com and the various subs, like litecoinmining, etc. I personally got sick of mining altcoins. But, there are benefits from doing so.

I built an airgapped linux-based platform from an old netbook. Did the whole MD5 checksum of files downloaded on a different machine that had a fresh Win 7 install on it, then used those files on brand new SD cards to transfer what I needed to to the hard-drive-less netbook and ran a live linux OS. Ran a saved copy of bitcoinpaperwallet.com and bitaddress.org, with armory and electrum... printed my info on a very old printer with practically zero memory, and moved some bits over to those addresses.

Again, I agree with the critique in general. Someone (I wish I remembered who) said that bitcoin will turn people's computers into "high pressure" money containers or something. Meaning, information security will take on new importance in the coming years for anyone in bitcoin or other cryptos. Totally agree. It's something you need a bit of background in to set up. But, there are also a growing number of guides and information sources to help people who haven't done much in this realm, available all over the place. 
I was just trying to implore people to go get started. Try something. Thinking about setting up cold storage does not equal setting up cold storage. So, just go do it. 
I agree, it's not as simple as putting dollar bills under your mattress - that's pretty simple and intuitive until your house burns down or someone breaks in (or your kid steals from you or something)... But it's easier than it seems.

The S3 units from Bitmaintech ship within the month, and are 478Gh for around $450 USD. That works out to approximately 3,000Gh (or 3Th) for $2824 USD. That's less than half what KnC is asking for and KnC is saying a Q3 shipment. 
For people who want a relatively effortless way to get in to bitcoin, sure, just buy some and watch the charts. Mining isn't terrible or inherently unprofitable. And you all should hope it doesn't get so. It's mining that allows the network to exist and be secure. :)
@_date: 2014-08-12 22:43:34
I appreciate the concession!
I would reiterate though that making $18 for $5 worth of electricity looks fine, but that difficulty increases between 10%-20% should be expected every two weeks. And if you're trying to return on investment the original $1500, that may never happen. 
In fact, that means in the first two weeks from today, you'd make $168, roughly. Then the next two weeks, you'd make $130, then two weeks after that you'd be making a little over $100. The two weeks following that would grant you around $85, then $68. It decays quickly. In this little rough estimation, the miner has only made $550, but he *spent* $1500 to do that. Now, it'd continue down, asymptotically, down to a net zero mining yield vs. electricity cost, but the most money is earned in the first few weeks. So, in this example, the miner would likely never see ROI, and if they did, it wouldn't be much. Especially if you also factor in the tax implications of both mining, and on selling, the bitcoin you're mining. This varies from country to country. 
I referred to *scale* because if ROI for a single unit as described - a power supply and three, say, Bitmain Antminer S3's - they may never break even and if they do they'll make a small amount more than they started with - this works if you've been able to buy a few dozen clusters of that rig setup as described. With 30 S3's, or 100, you're doing better overall, but have the same low rate of positive post-ROI income. 
I'm rambling a bit, but the point is, that you cannot consider something "wildly profitable" if indeed the cost of the equipment is never regained. That's not "wildly profitable".

I'm sad to admit I bought most of my mining equipment in Dec 2013 and Jan 2014 and it was, in hindsight, the wrong time to purchase mining equipment for the reasons you cited. The equipment was priced for $1,000 bitcoin. But, those doing the bulk of their purchasing in the last month and up to now and likely for the next few weeks will very likely be OK presuming they don't buy overpriced vapourware. 
@_date: 2014-08-12 02:33:50
I'm sorry to be contrary, but I would like to respond to one of your points. 
2.) Mining is not "wildly profitable". It costs a lot to get involved - a few Antminer S3's with a 1200w power supply will cost $1,500 right now, use around $5/day in electricity (erring on the side of caution), and you'd only make around 0.033 btc/day right now, minus ~20% every two weeks, and at $600 a bitcoin, that means a net gain of $12 a day for a $1,500 investment. $12 a day worth of bitcoin that will deteriorate every couple weeks. Now, if the price of bitcoin rose, then your 33 mBTC a day sounds better - but - then you'd have more people mining yet again, and difficulty would rise. It's an escalator you're walking the wrong way up, on. 
For most miners, mining is not profitable. The people making money mining are the ASIC companies who mine with their new products and sell the almost-obsolete hardware after the fact.

My story is similar to yours... 
At this point I feel neutral, but am holding. I was doing as much mining as I could possibly do some months ago, alongside trading, and while I'm hopeful, I think my brazen enthusiasm has mellowed into a realistic (hopefully) viewpoint of the opportunities.

I'm saying people regularly take each other's stuff. It's somewhat easier to take more of their bitcoin without violence than compared to, say, a burglary... and the second point here is well taken. You're saying that so _much_ of the proportional money supply is taken in the bitcoin economy versus the fiat economy. I think that has a lot to do with scale - there's only so much market capitalization in the bitcoin economy. It would be like a trillion dollars going missing in the fiat world.

I agree with your assessment sir, and while I am a decade younger than you are, I would argue that while some things take a while to get launched, once they do, the next wave of adjacent possible technological combinations becomes possible. For example, YouTube needed broadband in most homes, everyone to have a video camera in their pocket since most early videos were amateur submissions - and so forth. Now that people are using the internet and internet penetration is so high in most (at least Western) nations, it's that much easier to get people to use something new because they're already used to something older. Bitcoin would be practically impossible to explain to anyone in 1970, except theoretical economists maybe, but now, my retired parents understand it after it being explained to them half a dozen times. 
Toffler's whole 'Future Shock' concept isn't quite true - as you're mentioning without calling it that; people don't want to move at the bleeding edge of technology, but at the same time, once a kind of technology is widespread, something similar is that much easier to disseminate.

Mining seems like a great idea, and it's a fun hobby, but it's pretty tricky in effect. Timing is everything, and you have even more uncertainty than just by buying bitcoin and holding. 
If you wanted to see what it was about, you could buy a used 2.4 Gh USB miner from Amazon or something. You basically won't make any money aside from a few thousandths of a bitcoin because they're underpowered, but it'll cost you under $30 and you'll get a chance, if you set it up on your own, to start learning about what's going on when you mine. Something like this:

If I had cold friends to a new lifestyle choice - say I started working out or something - and they chuckled at me and brushed it off, I'd be thinking about getting new friends, too. 
I *do* agree that "bludgeoning" friends with a topic they're resistant to simply doesn't achieve anything good. But OP is saying maybe because they're resistant, he should find some pro-Bitcoin friends. What's wrong with that? He and New Bitcoin Buddy could talk the glory of the blockchain, tire themselves out, and then go back and bowl or play chess with the old friends or whatever.

Big change: Assuming current practices of fabricating money at the signature of a loan or mortgage agreement continues, or governments creating/"borrowing" it from federal reserves, a bitcoin-based economy would prevent those money laundering and counterfeiting practices by governments. But, national fiat currencies won't go down without a fight. 
You also don't need "interest" in a deflationary currency. Just hold your bitcoin, and in time, it's worth more. 
Look for what might happen if Bitcoin was 1% of the money system, either by transactions or market cap. All or nothing is difficult to predict.

Sure, it's better for 'the unbanked', international remittance, and merchants*... but if you're Joe Middle Class with a decent credit limit and a couple credit cards, it's a passing hobby. 
Unless you have issues with any of the following concepts: hyperinflation, bank fuckery, frozen assets, asking permission to send a friend a few thousand dollars, civil forfeiture, or "too big to fail" banks that got bailed out by various governments not too long ago. 
Bitcoin isn't perfect. Information security issues make devices "high pressure" money storage vessels. People keeping their money on exchanges or other bitcoin services have been "goxxed". People ordering mining equipment have been burned, literally and figuratively. But, cash has it's problems, gold is heavy and harder to divide, and diamonds have terrible resale value. 
But you're bringing up illegal purchases and anonymity, both of which really have less to do with bitcoin, and much more to do with humans, typically using cash, to satisfy their seedier desires. Since every transaction between two bitcoin users is trackable, I don't really think it's a great way to be completely anonymous, anyway. 
Also, it's my cakeday and I've enjoyed perhaps some wine tonight. And I sort of don't know what I'm talking about. Good luck finding the info you're after.

talks about this a lot. Not to be that guy. 
But my personal hope/opinion is somewhere around $3,000 in the next 1-3 months, then a 'fall' to around $1,000, give or take, creeping to $1,500 by February 2014. 
But who knows. Other people have said "the bubble we've been waiting for was the rally to $600-something a month ago", and yet again, others have pointed out that even if we follow the same cycle, the magnitude of the bubbles has been diminishing. Something like 1000x the first time, then 100x, then 30x, then 9x... totally not my observation but I forget where I saw that so I can't give credit; yet I agree, I think that *if* there is another bubble like that, it'll happen relatively soon and be around 5-6x the current price. 
Or, maybe no more bubbles ever.

reddit.com-&gt; good resource for mining talk.
As others have said, it's a tricky game to try to make more bitcoin mining than you could just buy. I know. Buying bitcoin now is basically the way to go, unless your electricity is ultra cheap (under 5 cents a kWh), you have money to deal with data center infrastructure requirements that scale quickly (cooling, ventilation, noise, etc.), and you don't mind knowing that difficulty increases every two weeks just mean you earn that much less. Return on investment is an ephemeral rabbit, running in front of you, and often never quite making itself within your reach.

Paying $5/mo for a chequing account is one thing. I believe these are percentage fees for what I would call a "savings account". And, that's bullshit. 
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:33:01
Don't forget the power supply. And one Antminer will use $25/mo in electricity, or thereabouts. 
According to some sample values plugged in to coinplorer, one S3 would mine 1.35 BTC over the next 6 months, but would use $25-30 a month in electricity. It costs around 0.6 BTC plus some money for the power supply, so all said, I think you could try it.

The Big Question in It's been asked likely every day for as long as I've been subscribed in that sub. The answer is usually "if you don't think mining is a good idea, don't mine". Which isn't all that informative, but, not bad advice. 
I mine because timing of purchase of equipment, electricity cost, and some measure of speculation, all lead me to mostly think there's a reasonable chance I do better than just buying bitcoin directly. Plus, I'm helping secure the network, but that by itself wouldn't drive me personally to have invested as I have. As a side perk, it's great.

Also a bit, as far as I know, is a millionth of a bitcoin, so 0.000001 BTC = 1 bit
I think it might be easier for people to say "Your coffee is 3 bits" rather than "your coffee is 0.000003 bitcoin" or "your coffee is three microbitcoin". 
Calling a microbitcoin a bit, as others have suggested, will likely not be all that confusing, especially if bitcoin in general is widely adopted. People say "yo, lend me some beans" (lol @ myself for the lameness of that) and others 'get it'. Bones, bucks, the Canadian "Loonie"... "greenbacks"... we have all sorts of names for certain denominations of money. So, why not "bit"?

I for one don't really think news and price are all that closely linked. &lt;shrug&gt; I think that is more closely linked (although in non-linear ways, probably) would be other markets, be they currency or commodity or real estate, etc., markets.

I started in scrypt because initially I figured there would be several coins for several purposes. I came to believe that there really isn't a need for more than one currency, at least so far as I can tell, and the others just didn't have the staying power. 
I'm reluctant to believe in Ripple because I don't see it as being all that different from a digital fiat system. I think that's basically what it is. But, I haven't looked too much further in to it. 
Anti-ASIC-based cryptos don't interest me because if they get ported from CPU to GPU even, the whole point is over. That happened with a bunch of them as far as I know. 
I stopped paying attention to the rabble though. Network effect, as others have said, basically means the difference between whatever specific currency being useful, or not useful. Beta vs. VHS... one was better but more people chose the more popular one, reinforcing that as the choice... few people wanted to mess around with having both, and those that did found they had no more Beta tapes to play in a short while... as I date myself.

S5 is good. Bitmain ships things (unlike, say, CoinTerra), and their stuff is well regarded. The S5 has a great watts/gigahash, but you'll need a separate power supply (add $80+) and that can mess with your Return on Investment (ROI) calculations. It's hard to calculate if you'll make money because it depends on the bitcoin spot price (unless you're covering the electricity otherwise) and on the difficulty. Both those things are hard to anticipate and/or predict. It's hard to do and make a real go of, but it's fun. Just don't sink very much money in until you've got a sense of how it works. Get a Bitmain U3 or something first.

That would be somewhere around $1,500. You'd have around 1.3Th, would be costing yourself maybe $5/day in electricity, could heat a small room, and would learn about bitcoin mining. You just might not make more in bitcoin that you're spending right now. Most people, especially over in will tell you that it's very hard to make more bitcoin than you'd put in to get the mining equipment and cover electricity. I like the hardware calculator at coinplorer.com, because it shows you what happens over time. It's just really hard to predict the difficulty increases over time. 
It is a fun hobby though.

Hey, look at all our pre-orders! 
@_date: 2015-01-05 08:05:51
Thank you for posting this! I have a couple points to add to the conversation though.  
I'd say the Ant S5 is probably a bit more efficient than the S4, but yes, since they're just shipping now, it's safe to assume that few people have any in great number... 
One thing I'd add that I personally didn't factor in to my own "phase 1" mining operation, is the cost to remove heat. It's not efficient, usually. Especially in hot climates. I had the benefit of cold winter air, and/or volumes of cool-ish summer air, but didn't have to use A/C or other technology. Plenty of people do, and even simple box fans draw current. 
Miners also don't make profit until their equipment is paid for. When you start adding the cost of electrical infrastructure, and the cost of the AISCs to begin with, you've got a situation where miners need to sell a great deal more than just electricity cost to make a profit. For example: one power distribution unit retails for $300 USD (yes yes, there may be cheaper models, but they're not free), and that's enough for 20-30 A worth of electricity distribution at 2xx volts. So a single PDU will drive up to 4 S4's (and maintain a comfortable buffer for electrical draw variability &amp; safety), and you need to pay that off, too. You need a panel with 240v circuits that have to be run to the location you have miners... residential settings aren't ideal for a number of reasons, and I guarantee industrial settings will need work too. So, the electrician and HVAC guys takes a few bills from you, too. 
In my limited experience, I think 37% of mined coins is more like 80-95% of mined coins, especially when you factor in basic infrastructure costs, cooling, and the equipment to begin with. No one gets free ASICs, even the manufacturers, so to exclude this cost is problematic when calculating what miners earn and spend. I'd started mining thinking I would be making 40%+ of the bitcoin as profit, and that was back when bitcoin wasn't loitering 'on the other side of the tracks'. My equipment wasn't very efficient (2 watts per gigahash), but a year ago, that was pretty standard. 
There's a very specific reason why the hash rate has been flat for a while, and is only picking up very recently. Early equipment that likely never met ROI is getting turned off because it costs more to run than it's making. I'm confident very few S1's, for example, are still on, unless they're paid for, as is all the infrastructure, your electricity is sub 5 cents per kWh, and you've undervolted them so they're more efficient per gigahash. 
Once people have paid for this infrastructure, etc., their 'next round' of mining *could* be profitable, but I suspect I'm not alone as an avid home miner who got out over the last few months... I've got the infrastructure now, but the lights are off on my mining equipment. The S5's might entice, or if Spondoolies releases a .5W/Gh monster, I might get back in. In the meantime, I'm a very tiny part of the reason why that hash rate dropped (or didn't rise) over the last few months... :)
TL;DR don't forget infrastructure, cooling, and the equipment itself. It all costs money. 
Thanks though for starting the conversation! :)
Humbly yours...

... Well I have no idea if Wlad is making noise here, or elsewhere, because I don't follow as closely as I'd like. There could be a better signal to noise ratio in as it pertains to development, but this is as close to a mainstream channel as bitcoin has, other than bitcointalk perhaps. (or some Chinese website?)
But your basic premise is flawed in several ways. You've made a false dichotomy between so-called 'talkers' and 'doers', even invoking the great Creator himself - Satoshi - failing to note that Satoshi was actively communicating with others early on, and also wrote a certain white paper. That's "talking". 
You claim that talking gets in the way of doing things - that's also clearly not true. There are a number of stakeholders involved in the bitcoin space that did not exist in 2009 or 2010 because they'd never heard of bitcoin. These people talk about it, and they have reason to do so. It doesn't invalidate their concern merely because they're not making commits to github or whatever. (Obviously I'm not one of your vaunted 'doers' - I don't code)
I don't know who you are, but with reference to your alias, I would like to point out that no scientist would get very far without an awful lot of talking. Grant applications, research papers, conferences, committee meetings - these are things I do know quite a bit about, and those who _do_, also must report. Reporting is a form of talking. Those who would do something involving strangers especially, also must talk. Especially if persuasion is required for group coordination of any kind. 
It is through communication, debate, and refutation that our ideas become stronger. As messy as it is, and your original point is not totally lost on me (I think you're talking mostly about _empty_ pontification) but this also provides avenues upon which those who might later 'do' can learn or contribute something. 
I've seen your posts on here, and generally I recall them to be informed. I'm sure you're a smart person. Maybe you're sick of ELI5'ing and arguing with much less informed people... if that's true, OK, point made. Soapbox rants from the barely informed are maybe irritating, but don't throw out all 'talking' or separate it from 'doing' like they're mutually exclusive.

Cool. I did an undergrad thesis once, too. It was fun to dive in to a specific topic. 
Some ideas: 
-I'd love to know more about traditional economists' viewpoints about bitcoin, if you can find any who would be able to say anything at all about it; i.e. be knowledgeable enough to comment. 
-I'm not a business major, but I suspect there's literature about financial theory/philosophy that justifies centralization in finance/banking. You could look at the axis of (de)centralization. 
-Could look at the effect of cross-border payments outside formal banking system. 
-Could look at the effect of the unbanked now having access to the sorts of services bitcoin enables. 
-Could look at the transparency of bitcoin - kind of a counter "it's all for shady people and shady transactions". How all coins are accounted for by all people with the blockchain. Really transparent, actually. 
Good luck. Would love to hear what you come up with down the road.

Supposedly, they cannot access the email on their server at all, because it's encrypted by the user. So, not "ridiculously easy" for them. 
You can send people on non-Protonmail accounts email that is encrypted and the receiving user must have/know the password to decrypt the email they just got from you. 
All messages between Protonmail accounts are encrypted by default. 
No one asked for my citizenship information when I signed up, so if Swiss data protection laws only applied to non-citizens, Protonmail would have no way of knowing who to protect and who not to protect, and, if you're going to make conjecture, I will too - they would likely protect everyone's data 'just in case'.

What's wrong? SegWit and LN are interesting and could do some good. There are also problems potentially. Also, they're not here yet, and we could do a block size increase in a few months. SegWit would require a rewrite of everything. Max blocksize, not so much. 
Everybody disagrees with the smallblockist vision. Your vision isn't Bitcoin. Go make your ProprietaryCoin and be done with it. 
Evidence? Blocks are getting full. There is a limit eventually to how many people can use the blockchain and that limit doesn't need to exist. We might not his Visa with only max block size increases, OK, but we need 2MB or 4MB or 8MB within the next few months, and certainly in the next few years.

The majority of hash power determines which chain we're following already. The transactions with the higher fees push out lower-fee transactions in a 'fee market'. We're already having a dominance of ruling happen without active human coordination in bitcoin, and it's built in. 
If what you're talking about is users and miners deciding which software to use, the majority will make that decision. Sometimes, you need more than a 51% majority, as would have been the case with XT. I felt comfortable with their switch-over model. Some people would have been left behind, and of course, XT has so far not 'caught on'. So, maybe if what you're not wanting is a second implementation getting say 75% of popular (node, miner) support,  you can run more Core nodes, or go with the three-quarter majority. Nowhere does it say the will of less than 25% of bitcoin users and stakeholders needs to be _absolutely adhered to no matter what forever_.

It's also inherently easier to monitor what that bank or entity is telling you. And you cannot send bitcoin to two people at once, so it is impossible to set it up. You could take people's deposits and tell them it was still there, and lend all of it to someone else, but it wouldn't actually be there. If the funds were bitcoin, they physically couldn't create more bitcoin than they had to lend it to as many people as they currently do with FRB. It's trivially easy to take someone's bitcoin and lie to them that you still have it, but that's not the same as lying that you still have it but being able to *create funds at the point at which the loan agreement is signed* is the problem you solve with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-08-22 09:20:56
OK, I think I get the question now. You're asking, if I may paraphrase, whether or not your bitcoin are safe post-fork, if such a fork occurs? Yes, they will be. There might be a period of time where _if_ a fork has occurred, that miners are somewhat frantically trying to decide which fork to mine on, that your coins would somewhat develop copies of themselves on both blockchains, but within a very short period of time, one set will likely become worth very little. In short, take it easy for a little bit if a fork occurs. But a fork would have to occur first, and there's of course no guarantee about that happening.

Sure. We're not there yet. I wish the community would agree not on technical details as if they were also somehow goals, but on what bitcoin could/should do in the mid-term. We need to know what we're managing for. So saying "it's important for coffee to be on the blockchain" also means "let's preserve the capacity of bitcoin to handle smaller transactions in a way that makes sense for people with very little money". Knowing what these goals are up front makes it possible to know what technical details to pursue. 
Now of course I'd be naive if I thought that 'the whole community' would agree on those goals. Some haven't thought about it. Some think it should stay small and niche. Some think it should be some kind of blank slate upon which to build their empires... we have different perspectives and goals as people in society, so why should it be different here? But I think that's where the conflict is coming from. It's not about which technical detail is _better_. It's about which set of technologies employed will support _which goals_. And I think the community doesn't agree about those longer term goals. We also tend to gloss those over in favour of technical arguments - that's usually how it is with power struggles.

Voting against XT is running Core. Running NoXT is something altogether different. 
Warning someone of something bad happening - when you're doing that bad thing is also something I'm not sure how to label. It's disingenuous and smacks of some kind of mob rule. There's nothing obvious as an outcome vis-a-vis running some spoofing counter-client. 
So say you want consensus. First there's censorship, technical obfuscation, personal appeals, logical fallacies, obvious lacks of understanding about properly functioning networks relative to capacity (i.e. what's enough), then attacking the option? Meanwhile, what is the other side doing? Attacking the people who did something? If you want to get consensus, work to build something. Make core better if you want people to pay attention. 
NoXT existing does not in any way follow from any actions done. Now you're just in a mud fight. 
Edit: Also that's not how voting works. You cast a single "in favour of" ballot. You don't get a vote in favour (i.e. running QT) and *also* a vote *against* someone else's vote. As a technical point. Use a word other than "vote" if you want to describe a power struggle, in my semantic opinion.

@_date: 2015-08-22 17:57:39
I think I agree with what you've said here. Let me unpack it for myself. 
Let's assume that 75% means a "super majority", and that 90% means "basically everyone", for the purposes of this comment. Say 10% of developers in this instance is "two guys". 
So if the super majority of users wanted to run something that basically all the developers wanted to run, we'd have no issue, probably. Unless the minority of developers had a really astounding point as to why they were not in favour of the thing that almost all the other developers wanted to run, based on perhaps a different time frame of concern - i.e. they were trying to do something painful now to prevent a larger problem later. But this often gets lost in the noise, and as humans, we're blatantly horrible at getting this right; we often let preventable problems go _unsolved_ until it's way too late. And in this case it's that much more difficult because it's highly unclear in certain cases what we "ought" to do, especially if relying on untested technology. But I'll bet that if the majority of users wanted what the majority of developers wanted, they would not be stopped by a minority of either users or developers. 
I wholeheartedly agree with you when you state that "the users should decide which code to run and what defines the bitcoin protocol". That's a central point I'm trying to make, too, and I agree with you. 
We do need more experimentation. Some things, I would suggest, are hard to experiment on though, like a governance framework. While I would personally hesitate to liken this for a dresden_k approved singular, top-of-the-totem-pole-decision-maker in bitcoin, I think we need some kind of vastly improved decision making structure for when we hit long-term differences of opinion amongst core devs. I think having access to a quality debate, with accurate information and as few logical fallacies and so forth is also critical. Reddit is a lovely platform and I'm partial to it (6 yrs here) but for what we're doing, I think there are some ways that it, or any more traditional forum setting, lacks features that would help with the 'stakeholder engagement' that bitcoin could use some work on as well. That's another post though. 
So yes I think I agree with you basically on your points. I don't think having the ability for bitcoin to have someone or some process to break a tie, or an impasse, is necessarily a problem of authoritarianism. I do think we should not dismiss any developer's idea outright, and that it's great that users can choose the code they think represents their interests best. In general, I think bitcoin and the organizations around bitcoin, could use some major governance work.

If 100% consensus amongst core developers are required, and even one person says "no" to something every time something new is brought up, or what we've seen, when a group of people are paid for by a company with specific intentions (for better or worse) towards whatever financially motivated reasons they have, then you don't get any movement, _and_ users don't get any choice. We run the official version or we take a hike. At least what's going on now gives some choice to users. 
All Hearn is saying here is that there should be some kind of hierarchical (i.e. the buck stops somewhere) decision making, so that the one guy (or four) can't just veto everything and be obstructionist, any time any changes are going to be made. 
Now it's your choice. Less theirs, actually.

Well, uncertainty tends to breed volatility. Your guess is as good as mine, but the market has done something in the last couple days... down to $250 US already. But who knows why that is. The market doesn't predictably respond to 'news'. 
Edit: To be clear, I'm not sure. I've been bullish (optimistic) for quite a long time, but lately I've felt some bear coming out. Bitcoin is plagued with severe governance issues. It's not about technical details, it's about how decisions are made, based on obscured goals that are not agreed-upon, and on the rhetoric and social distribution of (often faulty) information that stems from that. Reminds me of municipal governments, which is what I'm studying in graduate school. It's a mess. The price _could_ go up. But a lot has to happen before that happens in earnest. In the meantime, is a better place to hear people's predictions. There was a poll there recently and at the time I'd placed my 'bet', out of 250 people who'd voted at that time, 2/3rds of them thought the price was going to be the same or lower for the next four months. The fighting, I think, is having a negative impact. But, at the same time, I think something needs to be done - as in, people are fighting over an issue or an issue-set that needs to be resolved. So.

OH, for the sake of everything good in the world, don't ask economists. I agree with you on that. But what about people-who-aren't-programmers being part of the politburo's decision making process? Obviously bitcoin needs strong technical direction. Sure. What about international development experts? Sociologists? Systems theorists? 
There's a business I know of... hilarious old dude runs it. Called DiRTT (Doing It Right This Time).

It's not just about some North American's coffee purchase, though I feel coffee should be OK on the blockchain. Most of the humans on this planet live on less than a coffee's-worth-of-money a day, so by definition, *all* their transactions are microtransactions. People are interested in paying each other, and bitcoin would do poorly to draw some line at something wealthy white people in the West decide is 'enough to be interesting'. Just means you'll lose market share to some other way of doing that.

The problem with comparing it with multiple linux distributions is that they don't all need to work together to be linux. One guy could be running Dresden_Knix and it would be (probably not very) functional for me, and I could just run it in the basement. But it's not part of a functioning network.

Further, on your side points: 
- I'm a huge fan of rigorous peer review of code, science, statements of fact, and so forth. The code part though; that's why I'm here - bitcoin is open source and that's great. XT is open too, which is how you found out about that Tor hidden service censorship thing. I'll give you a point on this because *I didn't like finding out that it was in there when as far as I can remember I don't think I'd heard about this from the beginning* either. That said, I'm on the fence about whether or not I care about it existing. There's compelling information on both sides. I'll take your comment as a suggestion from you to reconsider it, and that you are not a fan.   
- I also agree with you about how a dictatorial model for bitcoin would be unthinkable. I just don't think Hearn has "reigns". If I don't like something I think he's doing, I'm out. If you don't like it - which I see that you don't, you're never _in_. What kind of shitty dictator can't even make you be in for a second? If I don't like what both Hearn et al., and Core are doing, I'm out. Now, you might feel like you're getting trampled on if you're part of a theoretical 25% who stick with core and XT takes over, but then you didn't lose to a dictator, you lost to the supermajority. We could have another discussion, not that I want to, about maintaining the rights of any minority group to avoid tyranny of the majority, but that's still not a talk about dictators. So say people all go to XT and then boom, Hearn starts ruining everything and being a party pooper. One thing XT _working and taking over_ would prove is that anyone can convince the majority of infrastructure-providers (node ops and miners) to switch, again. They've already released a 'big-blocks-only' version of XT. If Hearn fucks up, people will jump ship. If that ship ever sails. 
My definition of a dictator might be phrased as 'a person or group of people who have power over something whether you like it or not'. Saying "no" is a kind of power, especially if the train stops because you said it. So, a 100% consensus model grants people the right to be a dictator as long as they simply say "no" long enough. 
Dictators are bad, science is important. Fine. But I disagree substantively on your interpretation of what I've written here and in the last post, and I'll reiterate that I'm talking about politics, not science. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 01:29:51

@_date: 2015-08-12 05:25:50
I agree with you. 
The infuriating thing about the debate is that on one hand you've got the people who believe in larger blocks now, and are doing that with XT. It seems to me that XT'ers are not absolutely closed to side chains or off-chain transactions. Later. They want bigger blocks now. I agree with XT'ers, but I am not interested in running XT because... 
I'm in the camp that is a marriage of an odd mating of A.) people who want 1MB blocks because they have a conflict of interest and are trying to set themselves up to 'save the day' with LN, or B.) people who want any change in Bitcoin to be done with everyone in the party still in the party. The consensus people. They want bigger blocks but they don't want to support XT because they want Bitcoin Core for whatever reason to be the protocol they're using. 
I would probably consider myself in this camp though I wish that the 'bigger blocks' people would stop splitting their conceptual 'vote' between Core and XT when the division here between 'those who would keep bitcoin at 1MB so they can launch Lightning Networks immediately' and 'bigger blocks ASAP' is the more important distinction. 
The latter two groups (i.e. people who want to use Core but want bigger blocks, vs. people who want Core to stay the same so they can use LN) fundamentally disagree and are arguing over the immediate future of Bitcoin Core. Therefore I think there is a false sense of alliance happening because more people are using Core than XT right now - the disagreement within Core is polarized whereas (I suspect the majority) users using Core likely spiritually agree with XT. For this reason (that I suspect most Core users and likely almost all XT users are in favour of bigger blocks) I wish the LN/1MB block people would go form a subreddit called and were treated like the forking alt-coiners with the rhetoric that is currently being applied to XT folks. But I digress again. 
Note: I'm sure at the end of the proverbial day the small-blockers want bitcoin to succeed. They're all smart, their mothers love them, and I wish them all health and happiness. They want bitcoin to succeed, they 'bleed cypherpunk' as someone said recently. OK, fine. I don't challenge that now. I don't think there are _no_ problems with going to bigger blocks. But we're not talking about 100GB blocks next year. Switching to something where Lightning Networks or other off-chain transactions are going on feels more like that's the alt-coin or fork-coin contingent of bitcoiners because the bigger block people are changing one variable that enables bitcoin to continue functioning the same, but with more people. When you start changing the ways in which our transactions are handled to something akin to LN, you change bitcoin. In my growing awareness of the technical details, it feels a bit, if you'll permit me being a bit glib, like LN is like injecting a bit of Ripple into bitcoin. That's not what most of us signed up for. It can happen later if we all think it should. It shouldn't get in the way of bitcoin's immediate term maturation. 
But I digress. To summarize, I would like the "we should use Bitcoin Core; the block size should increase; consensus is important" people to get more together with the "XT is here now, forget you people, I fixed it" group. You both want bigger blocks. I wish those in favour of small blocks and LN would recognize that LN is fine; that something like that will likely be beneficial for a number of uses, but that we still need bigger blocks sooner, and to stop getting in the way of blocks getting bigger. 
The sheer level of ad hominem being spewed about is embarrassing. There's so much noise and so little signal, including from people from whom I would expect a more civilized debate. I have fallen victim to my own frustrations too. A great number of people have a lot invested in bitcoin - emotionally and otherwise - and while from the adage "don't invest more than you can lose" is fun to bandy about, losing an investment (especially perhaps emotionally) is still shitty. It won't negatively impact my life if this project shits itself and collapses under its own rhetoric, financially, with respect to what I've personally invested, but I would really hate to see that happen. 
TL;DR: We need bigger blocks. We need them soon. We'll probably use LN and/or things like it later, in conjunction with bigger blocks, but we shouldn't get in the way of a block size increase now just because we're holding out for LN. So much noise. Be kinder to each other.

@_date: 2015-08-21 23:50:53
Is that a question? I can't tell if you're looking for reassurance or making a statement. 
Bitcoin is, in some people's opinions, a safer hedge against some of the economic events we're seeing unfold, and the associated ramifications that will have on every aspect of the global economy, than some other ways to store value. 
On the other hand, it is still volatile due to a few factors. Would I rather have bitcoin than Venezuelan bolivars? Yes. Would I rather have US dollars than bitcoin? Maybe over the last two days, yes. Over the next decade? No, not really. 
I think so matter what happens to the code though, any bitcoin you have today will be accessible as bitcoin in the future. Whether we keep 1 MB blocks and add side chains and spinning hats, or go with larger blocks and add spinning hats, you're going to be able to use your bitcoin for the purpose you're bringing up. I see no circumstance where bitcoin ceases being a currency-with-other-uses and turns into something supporting only those other uses.

If you're watching the price every day with anxiety you might be holding too much. That said ask yourself this - if the price went to zero tomorrow, would it cause you to starve, or be homeless, or lose your family and friends? 
On the other hand, if the price goes up, back to say even $1,000, is that reward worth the risk of it crashing to zero? 
On yet a third, mutant hand, do you believe in bitcoin? Do you believe in the aspiration to have a decentralized, trustless currency that enables low-fee, relatively quick, permissionless transactions? I do. So I hold. I spend, too. I buy more to replace that which I spend.

I agree with you too, but I think he was trying to say that he doesn't know that XT has bigger blocks yet again after 8MB and that he would like an alternate, bigger block proposal that has bigger blocks, but ones that are big enough (either once, or dynamically) that are big enough for all possible future applications.

Nice slippery slope logical fallacy. Also a nice example of misdirection. 
Disagreeing with laws is part of democracy. So is critique. Not being able to disagree with existing laws happens in dictatorships. So maybe you should pack your bags? At no point did I say I disagree with the _concept of laws in general_. 
Polarizing what I'm saying by claiming that the answer to my apparent concern with the implementation of AML regulations is to _eliminate money_ is also completely ridiculous. 
I'd posed a good question. You said that Bitcoin needs to comply with the law in order to be legitimate. I asked whether or not the law(s) in question vis-a-vis compliance were legitimate. If you can't respond with anything better than telling me to go to Africa where money supposedly doesn't exist, then ignore me. You can downvote it because apparently there is no such thing as an illegitimate law, and I'll go move to Pakistan, where "rule of law doesn't mean much".

No offense intended, but I don't think you understand what's happening with currency across the planet. 
We haven't actually "abstracted our concept of Value to easy to reproduce paper Money". I actually don't know what your statement means, because there's a word missing, or one there that shouldn't be, but I think what you're trying to say is that we needed paper/fiat currency because there's so much value out there that we couldn't use precious metals as money. 
Not even sure where to start with that. That's not why "we" stopped using precious metals and moved to fiat currencies. Look up Mike Maloney on YouTube - he's got some good outline videos on what money is. 
Look up Hyperinflation. Look up the Weimar Republic. Look up "credit crisis". Look up the Zimbabwe Dollar. Understand that fiat = debt. Look up "fractional reserve banking". Look up what happened in Cyprus in 2013. 
The current system would have a major problem without the ability to print more money out of thin air, yet many would say that this "quantitative easing", or printing money out of thin air, is what got us into the corner we're in right now. [A funny video by Clarke and Dawe covers this]( In short, we'd need to be quite careful with credit. We're not now, and that's screwing us. 
There's quite an array of powerful groups with lots of fiat who would like to see themselves able to continue to spam photocopied currency all over the place to help themselves out in the immediate term, while inflation robs peoples' savings accounts, and while debt slowly (or not so slowly) begins to take over and before you know it, your debt to GDP ratio is 3:1, and you're up the creek.

Not really true. You'd be able to see your bank carrying out fractional reserve banking. You'd be able to see how broke your bank was.

Could have done without calling me a fool. I've seen you post insightful posts elsewhere and frequently on this sub. I know you're capable of it. I'd challenge you to avoid personal attacks like this in the future. One human being to another. 
I disagree though on the substantive point. It was neither a protocol problem nor an implementation problem. It's hard for a wallet even with adaptive fees to be able to predict what's going to happen. Once a transaction was broadcast, if someone didn't attach enough of a fee, it still took a long time and there really wasn't anything anyone could do once they were stuck in limbo. I had a few transactions held up for hours *with* a decent fee. 
And we probably disagree on whether-or-not-fees-are-OK, or maybe more accurately, how much of a fee is OK. And the network was saturated because peak capacity sucks with 1MB blocks. Bigger blocks would have meant that much much more spam would have been required to cause a traffic jam, and the traffic jam wouldn't have lasted as long. 
Also on a semantic note, I think it's incoherent to try to make a division between 'the protocol' and 'implementations of the protocol'. They are effectively the same thing. Certainly they are to the end user.

I have two Trezors, and one of them is slower to respond, too. Not sure why. 
I believe keeping your 'savings' in a Trezor is safe. I played around with cold wallets on paper, from an air-gapped laptop running Ubuntu, with an old 'dumb' printer connected, but I never felt quite safe enough (was the machine I created the bootable USB on secure enough? Is this USB key infected with BadUSB? Was that weird little glitch on my other PC when I was creating a system image because of lag, or some trojan? _Paranoia strikes dresden_k at +5_), and you have to spend the entirety of the contents in any given paper wallet lest you risk change address shenanigans. The Trezor is that much more functional. 
But yes, the seed (list of words) is what your Trezor uses to generate a bucket of private/public keys. It will generally receive coins to a new address every time, which makes your 'savings' hard to watch from a block explorer because after a while your coins (a.k.a. unspent transaction outputs) are in multiple addresses, but are still all controlled by the Trezor. Keep that seed off anything digital. Don't take a digital photo of it. Don't write it down on another computer. You could rebuild your whole wallet structure with those seed words if the Trezor you had was smashed to bits. 
Also a lot of errors seem to be coming from people's choice of browser, not the hardware. See if switching browsers helps the errors. If not, contact Satoshi Labs - they've been good with support when I've emailed them.

I'm not the best person to comment on this, but I think I'm being accurate when I say that someone was flooding the network with very-small-transactions with ~~no fees~~ [**edit**: they had fees, too], and that created a backlog of, at one point, approximately 100,000 transactions. I had a transaction **with** a fee held up in the 'clog' for over 5 hours, personally. 
There seem to be responses from the dev team present in the latest version of bitcoin core, and several wallet devs have said they would do something to add dynamic fees that users have the option of changing when such a backlog is beginning to emerge. 
I use Mycelium and given the 'priority' fee setting, most transactions should get through even with another 'attack'. 
What is gained? It's hard to say. Rumours abound as to who was behind it.

Find a local bitcoin ATM (coindesk has a map of them), and put in $5 or whatever. Some require you to have a phone number but to the best of my knowledge none of them will ask for anything like your birthdate. 
Just stay safe. Most people are well-intentioned, but people have been burned with online-only person-to-person exchanges (like through PayPal or what have you). I'd trust a bitcoin ATM more than a person I can't shake hands with, and if you're 14, no offence, but you probably shouldn't be meeting people through localbitcoins or other in-person options... an ATM is probably your best bet. Bring a friend or two. :)

If people are associated financially with projects, companies, or other concepts that are at odds with the success of bitcoin, it stands to reason that people would be critical of their intentions. 
It's also quite reasonable that as devs are at the helm and end-users have less and less individual influence, control, or understanding of the technical aspects of the protocol, that some anxiety would be expressed through forums like this. Do you think other public figures have any less scrutiny? Politicians? CEOs? It sort of goes with the territory. 
And, as others have pointed out, a great number of these people have a lot riding on the success or failure of this experiment. Sure - don't invest more than you're prepared to lose. OK, fine, but *if* failure is going to come from infighting and dev squabbling, expect people to get upset and start pointing fingers. 
Devs being positional, hostile, contrarian, or stubborn (or insert other unproductive behaviour) will attract negative attention. 
That all said, we're all human, and I do immensely respect those devs who've been raising this big ugly decentralized monster (jokes - much affection for bitcoin) from birth to the thrashing international entity it is. It would be an overwhelming feeling of responsibility I'm sure, and I think the community doesn't express gratitude enough. But that doesn't mean we, as stakeholders, shouldn't be critical. We should be productively critical, but as the community grows larger and larger there will be members who aren't productively critical (look across society - people love impotently complaining) and to some extent you need to prepare yourselves for that. 
If there are more productive forums for technical issues, great. And, yes, we should keep the ad hominem out of the debate as much as possible. But don't hold your breath and don't think this 'space' is any less susceptible to targeting leaders with uninformed attacks than politics or with any other celebrities or public figures. 
The more transparent people are, and the less (ideally no) conflict of interest that exists, the better.

Well, expectations are higher for post-secondary work. If this was a grade 10 kid's work I'd say you knocked it out of the park. If you were handing this in as a fourth year finance student's final project, I'd say you didn't pass. I'm not trying to be a dick, but I've graded students' work in university courses, and if you're working at a higher level, you need to bring a wider breadth of information than you did. 
It's good, but you missed some pertinent information that I would say is central to the concept of bitcoin. Let me elaborate... 
- Good intro. With you on page 1. 
- I like the email analogy, although to techno-phobes the ways in which bitcoin is *not* like email would confuse some people. For example, every email is not on everyone else's 'email ledger'. In the sense that they're both protocols, sure. They both involve a client, and sending of discrete information to other people, sure. But you can relatively easily spoof an email - that parallel is not one you'd want to erroneously paint about bitcoin. 
- You capitalize frequently when you don't need to - e.g. on slide 4. 
- Stylistically, some of your headers and bullet points are phrased in a way I wouldn't encourage - e.g. on the "I can mine bitcoins?" page. On that same page, you missed an apostrophe in "computers" with respect to its processing power. You could mention more explicitly what the computers are doing with their processing power. 
- I like the Advantages to Bitcoin slide, although I noticed by that point you hadn't mentioned the blockchain at all yet and that's a key thing about bitcoin that makes it unique. Maybe you need another slide about ideas that others have bandied around about possible additional layers on top of the bitcoin blockchain - mention Nasdaq's work, Mastercoin, etc? 
- Up to this point you also haven't mentioned that it's not backed by a government and is relatively decentralized. By the end, you still haven't mentioned that. 
- You also haven't mentioned the built in scarcity or the fact that the rate of new coin generation is a known factor with mining and block rewards. You do mention mining, I should say, but the details are a bit weak, even for an introductory presentation. Could be clearer there - for example, I know bitcoin so I know what you mean, but "once a goal has been reached a payment will be given out" is not informative. Are you talking about personal goals? Do I need to do 12 burpees and I'll get 100 bitcoins? That's where a slide about the blockchain before the mining section would have been helpful... again, talking about benefits from an immutable decentralized ledger would have been good to mention. 
- On the slide after that, I'd suggest that you don't really mean "degree of acceptance" specifically when you're really talking about awareness in general, or perhaps skepticism about the technology... You might have early on talked about the core traits of currency (fungibility, transferability, divisibility, etc.) and said that bitcoin isn't a terribly amazing store of value (well, it would be if you bought in pre-2013, but you get that volatility is somewhat counter to some notion of reliability or security of the continued relative value of your investment - alas, I don't want to go off to far from topic and I'm not personally convinced at all that it is *not* a good store of value - 95% of my own "savings" are in bitcoin).  
- You mention active development as a disadvantage; perhaps you should have a third slide about other characteristics that are both disadvantageous and advantageous. I'd suggest that active developers are a positive characteristic (vs. other alts with no full time developers at all). I'd also suggest that it's open to the community to discuss, propose, debate, and contribute to the future development of the currency. That's some kind of direct democracy, although not all persons can contribute equivalently, the possibility for access is there, unlike with the current system of fiat we're using where we don't even get to know which banks are 'shareholders' for the private Federal Reserve. The core is being revised many times a day and week - and done so in a relatively visible way. That is not an unsubstantial piece of information. 
- You've got some unnecessary bullets - and the Legal Standing bullet, as you've pointed out, might be on a 'not sure if good/bad' page. Although I would also suggest that it's a stretch to say that something being outlawed-in-and-of-itself is a benefit. 
- Your history slide should be at the beginning. Noting that - why not a "future directions" slide illustrating some longer-term possibilities? 
- If you're doing a timeline format, there are better ways to visualize that. 
- Other cryptocurrencies - like e-gold? I admit I know almost nothing about cryptocurrencies before bitcoin, but if you're going to mention them, at least name one. What's the difference? This actually also brings up a point that you could define the term cryptocurrency better, earlier in the presentation. 
- Might say "other cryptocurrencies began to emerge, such as Litecoin". 
* Unnecessary comma under the "in 2013" header. List the "many mainstream websites" - Dell, Overstock, Newegg, Tiger Direct, etc. 
- Why show just a year's worth of market spot price? Or, show that, then show the 5 year chart. "The price has fallen since the all-time-high several years ago, but the overall trajectory has been up for 5 years..." 
- You also could have mentioned things people are doing with bitcoin - for the unbanked, for remittance, facilitating smart contracts, coloured coins, DACs, and so forth. 
- That blue block people have mentioned could have page numbers. 
Again, no offence intended from any of this feedback. I acknowledge that I'm critiquing your work but haven't made a presentation of my own - that I'm sure others would also critique. See it as hopefully helpful criticism that you could do a significant revision or two to this presentation and you'd be in a good position to distribute the thing. Do a James D'Angelo and make a YouTube channel if you don't have one already. And again, in response to the "no one is impressed by anything you do in college" is a comment that begs for specific critique because, sadly, in my opinion, this is not college-level work. But you could get it there with revision and accepting these and others' comments. PM me if you want more commentary on future iterations of this. Happy to try to help. :)

Here's a question - how do I set up something like what's going on with port 80 on this [node]( I know that's likely a newb question... simple HTML for certain, but must I run a web server, and is such a thing 'built in' to Ubuntu that you're aware of? 
@_date: 2015-08-22 10:03:52
You didn't "have to explain to me the difference between a soft fork and a soft limit", because I didn't ask that question. I said "I think it's easier to put a soft cap on block size rather than go through this process again, isn't it?". That's what I asked. You interpreted that, as I read it, as an invitation to be helpful, I thought, and try to answer a question I wasn't asking. I didn't respond, and I'm terribly sorry if that hurt your feelings. You seem a little riled up, as you're now claiming that I'm "advocating for an overthrow of scientific peer review processes". That's actually not at all an accurate observation.  
I think you've also taken a divergent stance on my comments about hierarchical decision making, seeming to think I claimed that I am somehow in favour of a dictator, as if that is the only possible meaning I could have been getting at paraphrasing what I thought _someone else_ was claiming that there _"should be some kind of hierarchical decision making"_. That was, in following, a measure to avoid getting stuck if some people want to implement something, and the last man standing doesn't. Scientists disagree. That's great - it's what scientists seem to love doing. Scientists can sit around and argue all day, and for their whole careers, and teach snot-faced 18 year olds, and pump out regurgitated research papers, and that's their whole job. They don't ever have to _do_ anything though. Not most of them. 
What you're talking about is more an engineering problem wrapped in a _highly political context_, and for that reason, engineers frequently don't have the luxury to talk _forever_ about something; obviously that's hyperbolic, but meant to illustrate that at some point, an engineer, or say an engineering group, must stop talking and do something. If you had a group of say, 10 engineers, working on a significant project, and most of them had formal ties to some kind of third party that had significant financial interest in the base project they were all deciding upon, and the group got stuck in a name-calling veto-fest, there's some benefit to being able to break the tie. Usually, engineers aren't even the ones making the decisions - it's policy-makers, decision-makers, executives, shareholders, or citizens, depending on the context. That's what I think Hearn meant when he brought up a more hierarchical decision making process. 
So, unlike "in science", if you're trying to _do_ something, there may come a point where having one single person be able to halt the process indefinitely by saying "no", I'd call that obstructionist. You can call it whatever you want. What I'm talking about sure isn't 'the whole idea and concept of science and peer review'. 
I didn't claim to support dictators. I would agree that a dictator in bitcoin would be horrible. I would also remind you that I _also_ pointed out how you are not stuck with a dictator if you can choose to just up and run a different code. For example, if say, Hearn, was a total dictator, and people didn't like it, they'd use Bitcoin ZT or they'd go back to Core. That's the choice I was talking about. And maybe everyone will stick to Core. And you don't have that choice if the _only option is Core_. So you failed to pick that up from my writing, and/or I failed to be as explicit as it would have taken for you to interpret that from what I wrote. So in the interest of finishing this post before I turn 40, I'll offer that ceding point to you. 
_I_ didn't claim anything about 'non-technical users' having debates or sway about the technical details. I said _nothing_ about that in any of the whole two posts you've decided to grace me with a response on. What I claimed users have now is a choice of which code to run, and that's empirically true. I could run Core or the other one. It's a choice. Sure, the technology is governed by practical and theoretical limits. No, I don't claim that even most users will even know the half of what it takes to make bitcoin work, even as is. Sure, users often won't have enough information to have "correct" opinions about technical matters. But where did I suggest that some majority of non-technical users should pester for the impossible?  
On a side note, _I don't envy the core developers right now, because they're basically being asked to be the scientists, the engineers, and the decision makers, all in front of a growing mess of a million plus users and dozens of major players from across the world. That's what I'd call downright insane._ 
And again, if you're referring to what's happening with bitcoin's development arena, I don't see a "meritocratic, scientifically benchmarked process" that "ignores the will of the majority" as being two concepts that apply to the current situation. First of all the core developers are, I'm sure, talented, uber-duber-super-smart, and back their work up with peer-reviewed scientific papers 100% of the time, and never speak outside their expertise. They also have no conflicts of interest, and are completely rigorous academically as far as how they make their claims. Let's pretend for a second that all that was always true. Still no scientist or group of scientists could write a paper titled: "All of Bitcoin And Everything It Could, Can, Will, and Should Mean For Everyone, Forever"; but there is definitely science going on. Math is being done. There's merit involved in how people got to be included in the inner circle. But this has nothing to do with what you're claiming I said. Because once all those really smart, educated, peer-reviewed people start engaging in a power struggle, The Magic Of Science goes right the fuck out the window and you see raw, brutal politics. You see character attacks. You see disinformation, misinformation, and so much noise your eyes start bleeding. And this is happening from both sides to some degree (though I personally see much more one one side), and then from all the unwashed masses, who add more noise usually than signal. Worse, most of us think that _we're_ the Right ones, even if we're obviously not! 
And that doesn't even begin to address how all the scientific peer review processes cannot begin to tell me what bitcoin is for. Because I have views on what it should be for. Others do too. That's why there is bitcoin. That's why we've invested. That's why some of us mine(d). That's why some of us run nodes, and talk about bitcoin at family dinners, and tell our friends about it. Because it matters to us in a non-technical way. It matters because of our normative expectations of us. So there A.) has to be a dialogue between your scientists, and we users - or there are 10 guys in a real echo chamber arguing about theory for no one; and B.) the technical details are entirely limiting factors for certain kinds of asks by the community, _BUT_ it is actually the aggregate vision of the users (presuming that's not split, or too divergent, as well; then you have a different problem, and part of the reason why people make alt-coins, or join that should be met with a "well, we can't do that with our current technical knowledge", or a "yes, we think any of these options will get the technology closer to what you, the users, are asking for in some way, shape, or form". 
If the users' demands, asks, or requests, are not met for the majority for long enough, they'll stop using bitcoin. Without users, there's no bitcoin. The scientific process, as you call it, can define current limitations, but users' preferences ought to direct where energy is focused. Where energy is focused results in the specific kinds of changes or improvements will happen eventually. If we didn't care about going to the moon, we'd have spent the money and energy on other things. Going to the moon wasn't possible, until it was. It wasn't the scientists who lead that charge, either. They were _absolutely involved_, but they're just part of the picture. There are engineers (who are not purely scientists), and of course, everyone else. So this is a _governance problem_, not really a technical one. Because, again, this isn't about whether science has an answer. My comment was about the politics of bitcoin. So, kindly don't put words in my mouth about scientific process. 
... got too long, going to part 2.

Even if I disliked XT and what it stood for, your statement is based on a faulty assumption. 75% of users and miners would have to implement XT in order to have it "attack the network" but at that point, the bulk of the network *would be* XT. If no one runs XT, you have nothing to worry about. If more than three quarters of people run XT, you're probably one of them and have nothing to worry about. You're not under attack. You can come out from under the table.

You'd probably be interested in some of the later works of philosopher Bruno Latour. He started his work, as I'll paraphrase and summarize, as a relativist. Basically that everything is relative - nothing is right or wrong, but that we've all made subjective choices about society, etc. He went back on that in his later works and spoke about how some things are indeed objectively true; his example was climate change, but you may draw your own parallels. You might enjoy looking in to that.

The highest figure I've seen would be that bitcoin could be worth a theoretical total of $3,000,000 per, but at that point, there's nothing left to compare it to. So, 1 BTC = 1 BTC. But it might buy you all the houses on your block. 
More likely, it's $300-400 next year.

Let's not get ahead of ourselves. A personal opinion as stated by Putin that it "may be used in the future" likely means that individual people in the country might be able to use it. Not at all necessarily that Russia is going to do any adopting officially. He also says that bitcoin isn't backed by anything. So that's not at all positive. 
Being not-against something is not the same as wanting to adopt that thing officially.

I appreciate your candor. I've been realizing that it's not uncomplicated, and I certainly don't think it's a gold mine. 
I think I misrepresented something - I don't intend to superman my way through reprogramming anything - When I said 'back end' I meant 'the ways in which I keep books', 'how I manage my float', and so forth. Business process. 
I am picking up how it's lots of work. I'm also picking up how it doesn't pay that well, so splitting the profits up amongst more than one other (and even then) might mean it's not worth the effort, as well. I can see how running multiple ATMs could benefit from a team, but one? 
I am certainly ignorant, though am not trolling. Certainly I wouldn't want to have a grand opening followed by a grand closing, and having done residential mining for 18 months, I understand the technical work that can go in to the background keeping the machines happy. 
Hopefully I do you proud! :D Or, at least, hopefully I don't make you all look bad!

If the USG is the biggest holder other than Satoshi (not sure if this is accurate though, about the USG), why would they benefit from devaluation? Wouldn't they want it to be valuable so their baghodling would be better for themselves? Don't they get capital gains taxes from early adopters who gain big? 
I just don't see the motive. There certainly is the capacity from the USG or other major national institutions to try to "hack" people, but that still doesn't address the motive issue. 
The easiest way to devalue bitcoin would be to break the protocol. Break SHA-256. Maybe the NSA has done that secretly, but I seriously doubt that. I'm not a computer scientist, but I don't think that's possible. More computing power than a perfectly efficient computer using all the energy in the universe or whatever. 
And again, why? The market cap is so tiny you could just buy them all and send them to burner addresses. It'd be cheaper to declare them a crime to have. 
I dunno. I see absolutely no motive.

... protected from charismatic leaders, sure. But if XT works, as it's designed, it's because 75% of nodes, and 75% of blocks over the last 1000 have been mined with XT. That wouldn't be because of any charismatic leaders, it'd be because people like you and I decided to run XT. We could argue all day over whether or not 75% of nodes and miners represent "nearly everyone", but it's much more than a hair over 50%. 
I'd be all for a precedent of 75%+ of users deciding how they'd like bitcoin to go, rather than through the gauntlet of bickering developers, and through two censored forums. Remember, XT doesn't come in to effect if it never reaches 75%. So I really don't know what people are worried about. 
I believe in bitcoin. If core and the process around core is so good, it will prevail. Don't you agree? Or do you not agree that core will prevail?

I suppose. However someone savvy enough to run a node is probably (I'd hope) not going to leave their coins on a hot wallet on an unprotected computer in a DMZ behind their unsecured router, running XP and as an avid downloader of spam email attachments... 
Just because you know an IP doesn't mean you can just get in. Of course, I don't miss your point that it shines a light on your home, in a literal and figurative sense. So, yes, as long as you're happy with your security, go for it. 
I suppose just because someone runs a node doesn't necessarily mean they own bitcoin, also. It seems quite reasonable, but doesn't necessarily mean that...

Your post is a shrewd and diplomatic response to mine, and I appreciate that. I enjoy that game - I've played it actually. I was one of the clerics or whatever the werewolf hunters were. I got killed literally first though by the townsfolk because they thought I looked too smug or something. I was going to, in my head, save the townspeople from the werewolves, and I was smiling a bit. So, yes, public perception can indeed be very wrong about a person. 
It doesn't help though that the guy is posting in stuff like: 


This is a serious offer." 
--  with regards to making another ~stress test~ / tx flood happen, even though he did clarify later in that [post]( that he was trying to strengthen the network. 
Ok, fine, but why work with buttcoiners? Is he trying to make money from them so that he can benefit bitcoin after all? It just seems sneaky. So, he might be the good guy in the Werewolf game you're talking about, but it definitely doesn't always seem like he's "on the same team". 
Edit: I'll add - I'm a fan of counterpoint with respect to the strengthening effect it has on an idea, or in this case, a system, but there's a line and at times it seems that he steps over it.

Home computers can't keep up with specific hardware some manufacturers have made to do the task and nothing else. That hardware is called, generally, an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). 
See [Bitmain]( as a generally respected example of an ASIC manufacturer that makes bitcoin mining hardware. 
There are some bitcoin mining hardware profitability calculators, such as the one at [Coinplorer]( but keep in mind that it's based on three uncertainties. 1.) You can't exactly know what the difficulty rate will be. 2.) You can't exactly know what the spot price of bitcoin will be, which is relevant for your electricity cost, and 3.) to a lesser extent, it's hard to know how long your equipment will last, though usually the equipment lasts longer than it's profitable. 
Also know that most small-time miners are losing money. 
Buy one of those U3s and plug it in and get it working but don't spend more than $50... you'll learn how SHA-256 based coins are mined and have a bit of fun. But mining is not a guaranteed money maker even against the already-volatile spot price of bitcoin more generally if you just bought bitcoin and held it. 
Disclaimer: I dove in and mined as much as my residential panel could handle, for over a year. Didn't really make much to speak of. 
Timing is everything, but for the most part, you also need cheap power, and to be lucky enough to catch a price upswing so that you can sell your coins for more than the electricity costs. Now might actually be a good time, but start **SMALL**.

@_date: 2015-09-16 21:12:41
I think you're referring to the concept of money being a store of value. Indeed, bitcoin's price is volatile, but the only thing that will change that is overwhelming mass adoption. Nothing else really has any value except its intrinsic value, but it's a lot harder to barter with commodities like oil barrels or pressed tea leaf cakes. Gold and silver have value because they are industrially useful, and gold doesn't corrode. Otherwise it's just a shiny rock. But we ascribe value to gold because it is in limited supply and because it doesn't corrode like other metals would over a very long time period. Otherwise bitcoin has all the same characteristics of money with some threats on the fungibility front... TL;DR the price would stabilize if way more people used it. But it's also been pretty much $230 USD plus or minus $40 or so for the last 6 months or a little longer... that's relatively stable compared to other currencies of similar size. You don't usually see something like the USD lose 10% of its value in a day because that would take a lot more action to accomplish as it has a larger market cap. Not to say more people using bitcoin would automatically stabilize the price, but it would help. Otherwise you're trying to find a store of value in anything these days, and you're struggling. Real estate? Maybe if you're lucky and can read global trends like a fortune teller. Gold? Yeah maybe, if it's physical. What else? You gonna go spend your life savings buying a _government bond_? Hahah. Stocks? Some companies are pretty stable, but for your life's savings? Fiat currency that devalues over time to the point of hyperinflation? Ours hasn't yet, but... all fiat currencies die eventually.

Two big things: only 21 million bitcoin (or less because of loss) will ever exist, so it cannot be hyperinflated and debased by your local neighbourhood Federal Reserve. Second thing, you can send value to anyone, anywhere, almost instantly, for a few cents, without asking permission.

I hear you, OP. I was running everything from hot wallets for a little longer than I care to admit. 
I did the airgapped linux-based franken-netbook with an old printer and managed to get some wallets that some of my stash is still stored on. But the process was tiresome. 
Then I got a Trezor and don't give it much thought now. Am probably going to get a Mycelium Entropy too. Spread out your investment. 
I agree what some of the others here have said - learn how to do a cold wallet with a very small amount of bitcoin. You don't have to (and maybe shouldn't) go put your whole amount in something you haven't tested and become comfortable with, yourself. 
It's not as hard as it sounds, though, once you get started. Lots of good tutorials exist. Lots of people willing to help, too.

I was 100% super mega ~~confident~~ delusional that August 2014 **was definitely it** and that we were going moonbound. I was so wrong. Bought a bunch of $650 coins only to watch it fall to the 2015 'stability'. Then I bought more over the last year. And overall my dollar cost average is pretty low, even including 2013's coins.

@_date: 2015-11-04 02:34:54
The Trezor is a hardware wallet that you use in conjunction with another wallet (like on your PC). The unit is somewhere around $100 and has been used widely (with I don't think any incidents). I use one. It generates your private key separately from the PC or Mac (or phone, if you have the right cable) so it is completely safe from hackers. Easy to use, too.

I seriously doubt most 'hackers' would go for brute-forcing your keys. 
They'd just exploit or backdoor you, and get the key you entered, or that was created, in a vulnerable system. 
@_date: 2015-03-21 04:05:36
The point is that the device you create the paper wallet on (or in this case, the Entropy device) needs to be secure. 
Entropy, I gather, is a secure way to generate paper wallets rather than going through the hassle of airgapping a laptop with Tails OS or something. 
The Entropy plugs in to your printer. You press the button, again I gather because I don't have one, and it basically allows the printer to print a new set of keys for you. These keys never 'saw the internet', so they are presumably more safe than a similar paper wallet connected to a machine that may leak your keys after the fact. 
I don't own an Entropy, but this is what I think they do. 
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:03:38
You could buy one for $1 and see how it worked. 
You would probably not even pay that $1 back. 
Edit: the decision to get in to mining needs to be made with more information... Check out companies like Spondoolies-tech or Bitmain, run some hardware mining calculators until your eyes are crossed, and still get yourself something like a 50GH machine to see how they work. Don't spend money investing in mining if you don't get how it works. It's _fun_ but I don't think all that many people make money doing it.

In many of the same ways, questioning someone's frame of reference, whether religious, financial, social, or otherwise, challenges the epistemological foundations we (some might say 'must') rely on to function day-to-day. A professor I once had talked about our "mythical questions", or the unspoken, foundational realities that we take for granted that help us understand what it means to be alive, and how we should treat each other, become healed, and so forth. Money is up there amongst the foundational frames of reference. When you talk about why bitcoin may be a positive thing, you almost must highlight the ways in which our fiat system is lacking. When people consider for a moment that their life's savings, pensions, and other investments are basically debt-based illusions, that are not controlled by them, and that can be taken away rather easily, they feel uncomfortable. Cognitive dissonance often results, and they get mad. That's my take.

I'm in a comparable position with respect to where I'm at in the process, though instead of trying to outsource the risk, I'm trying to figure out if I'm comfortable managing it. I hear you that it's daunting. I'm still not sure it's a good idea for me with what I can bring to the table, and I've had in-depth conversations with quite a few 'in the know' people. 
I haven't seen any 'turnkey ATMs' but you might find an exchange who wants to do an ATM partnership with you. They generally own the machine and deal with the sort of stuff you're looking to avoid. You get less of the profits but have less work to do also. 
Compliance people and anything legal will be expensive. Lawyers routinely charge $500/hr and paralegals and other quasi-legal advice will still be hundreds of dollars an hour. Plus most lawyers have probably never really heard of bitcoin, so their assistance may be more limited to things like 'helping you with a lease agreement' or what not.

People don't like Motherhood and Apple Pie challenged. 
Money is a pillar of modern industrial civilization. We seem to think that said civilization is the best, ultimate, and purest form of living arrangements we could possibly come up with. It's based on a certain number of tenets, including that Banks are Where You Keep Your Money Safe, that Growth Is Good, Necessary, and Inevitable, and that The Harder You Work The More Money You'll Have. 
None of these things are _always_ true, though they have been true in the past. Most people don't really get where money comes from, myself included (though I imagine I 'get it' more than an average person off the street) so when you challenge What Money Is, you're also challenging everything else they think they know about society. You're basically kicking their ontological securities out from under their feet. 
But at the same time, there might be something in it when people reject _certain_ assumptions or posits made by members of this community if it comes across as too self-righteous or self-congratulatory. Bitcoin _isn't ready for mainstream anything_, despite that I would so much like it to be so. I personally believe we could get there, and I'm working hard in my own neck of the woods to help people discover it and make their own minds up, but if you controlled a mid- to large-sized company, country, or just had a bunch of money from the traditional system, and things appeared to be "working fine" for you, why would you make the switch? 
I've had intelligent people ask me "but what problem does Bitcoin solve" and despite my retorts about immutable ledgers, permissionless wealth transfers, border-erasing ease, remittance, the unbanked, etc., most of them just tell me the traditional fiat/banking/central bank/fractional reserve banking is the way to go. 
Sometimes the best way to convince people is to show them. Some people will get it at the outset. I think most of us would self-identify in this way. We see the vision. I think a lot of people don't have time or energy to see that vision, and want to see proof. They want to see gas stations accepting bitcoin, and grocery stores accepting bitcoin, and their employers offering to pay in bitcoin. Of course that won't happen overnight and there's no guarantee it'll ever happen... indeed there are plenty of bitcoiners who don't seem to want that to happen, preferring the 'digital gold' iteration of what bitcoin could be. 
So we're ourselves a divided community. And divided in more ways than nominally. (i.e. there are more than two points of view within the bitcoin community - there are many viewpoints and intentions) So some people want 'coffees on the blockchain' and others want to tokenize the bitcoin token and minimize the currency-part of the technology... ala blockchain... so it's complicated. Therefore the messages people receive from us are inconsistent. You might tell your friend it's a great way to buy soap online, and I might say it's a great way to write your car's VIN into a few satoshis and replace your central registry system in Wherever, State. Yet someone else wants to run an online gambling site powered by bitcoin. So we're not all 'selling' the same thing.

It's not a scam. The profit margins are just very slim, and there have been a bunch of companies claiming to ship amazing mining equipment and then didn't. Or it came very late and/or didn't perform to spec. Or they caught fire. KNC is not a well-liked company, and I wouldn't recommend their machines. 
If you want to get started try and keep in mind that most home miners barely break even if that. 
Solar is fun but it is only providing you with free electricity when the sun is out, and mining equipment runs 24/7...

I appreciate, for one, that you spelled out your reasoning. 
I disagree strongly with your assertion that the "only reasonable way to respond" is to delete content. 
If you let third parties (like, say, myself) look over a drama unfolding, you look suspicious, even if you're objectively correct, when you delete the "troll's" comments. That said, I'd also say that calling someone a troll is resorting to ad hominem as well, so be careful with that if you're trying to avoid hypocrisy. 
I was originally against LN and have been looking into it on insistence from some people with whom I originally did not see 'eye to eye' about it, and I'm open to it and have been researching for myself since then. I _don't_ think that it's an either/or; that is, I think LN or Liquid or other sidechains might co-exist with other scaling options. What I don't like are people immediately jumping to accusations, all the censorship, and other shit that you're also complaining about. And contributing to a little bit.

Money _was_ an IOU when it was a promissory note representing physical gold (yours) in the bank vault. Now, "money" (fiat currency) is a promissory note representing debt. There is more debt than there is fiat currency - figure that one out. So I trust that bitcoin doesn't represent debt to someone else. If I have "a bitcoin" (private keys representing bitcoin on the blockchain) I have something. If I have $1,000 in the bank, the bank likely doesn't really "have" that - they've lent it out via fractional reserve banking practices and what I have on my bank account is an IOU from the bank to me that I have no control over, and doesn't really exist. Bitcoin exists; it is digital and if I have the private keys, I have something, debt-free. I trust that more than the system we've built in the meantime.

If you want to do it for fun, get a couple Antminer U3's and figure out how it works. You'll make all of $0.001 cents a day but you'll learn something. 
If you don't have $10,000,000 to invest in a professional mining farm you're probably losing money. And even then you only make money because the margins are so slim... but 1% of a million is maybe better than nothing...

In agreement, I suspect that when people, perhaps especially intelligent people, are not listened to or people don't seem to pay attention to your points, they become indifferent and/or hostile to the concept of 'debate' and resort to trolling instead.

The big question isn't directly "is mining going to be profitable", it's "to what extent do I think mining is going to be more profitable than just holding". 
As I see it, mining is twice as 'risky' (if you think it is) than simply holding bitcoin. With mining you need to hope the price at least doesn't fall out from under you, because your napkin math won't anticipate huge drops. You'll pay more than you think for electricity and if you get more than a few miners you'll start running into infrastructure problems (power distribution, cooling) even if that means jury-rigged box fans. That all takes work and time and funds, and it seriously seems that unless you have access to a free garage with 2 cent kWh, you're probably not going to do any better than simply what you could do if you bought btc low and held it for a while.

Effectively Zilch. 
To mine you need an ASIC (application specific integrated circuit). There are a few manufacturers. Two I have personal experience with are Spondoolies-Tech and Antminer. I can vouch they ship real products that actually work. (This is not true for all manufacturers)
Even these specific machines may not break even, especially if you don't have cheap electricity. 
Check out too. 
You could use that Raspberry Pi to run a full node though. That's free (other than bandwidth) and you're still directly supporting the network. You'll earn nothing, but you'll learn a lot about bitcoin.

Hmm. I guess? If you're already _in_ debt you might as well say "ok, I owe $10 B USD, I might as well print it all - then I've paid it back!" so yes. It's great to inflate your money. Just pay it all back by printing it all! It is totally a _good_ thing! There's no way that could backfire!  /s 
Sorry, don't mean to be snarky to you. I think the problem is that a.) we are where we are, but (hyper)inflation won't help in the long run, and b.) we shouldn't endorse or enable a financial system that gets countries and therefore their taxpayers into such horrific debt to begin with.

But it isn't that "it all equals out". In our current system, there will _always_ be more debt than there is currency. We cannot escape it. If all debts were paid, there would be nothing left. We print our way ahead of the debt wave, and when the wave catches up to us, we go broke. So I agree with the end of your post - I think we've let powerful groups build an economic system that enslaves most of us (and whole countries) in debt and it is an enormous ponzi scheme for the 1% plutocrats. Meanwhile the rest of us in the "precariat" or living in straight-up poverty, are told we have a certain responsibility... i.e. "our share of the national debt". It's bogus.

Yeah! You're very correct. ~3,600 if I'm not mistaken! Every day, more or less the same number of coins are released to the market. Every day, all day, until the Halving. Then - still predictable!  
It doesn't go up in spikes, and nobody can unilaterally decide they're going to make 10,000 more bitcoin on Tuesday. 
While bitcoin is in an inflationary stage, it's at minimum, predictable. Guessing when the EU is going to print itself into oblivion, however, is hard to anticipate, for example. 
It's (bitcoin) also not _debt_ based. That's a big thing. Debt based fiat is destined to collapse, and historically, that's what happens.

People seem to pick their priests, so to speak. Most people in would say that, yes, it is worth getting in to bitcoin. 
Beyond that, you'll get a variety of answers from people. Mining probably isn't a good idea. Trading could be, but I think trading cryptocurrencies isn't much like trading forex, so it's kind of in its own league and I think a good number of alt-coin traders lose money. 
Then there's getting some bitcoin, learning how to store it safely, and using it to get stuff. That's mostly what's fun.
