poverty is the natural state of being, wealth is infinite, it is the individuals responsibility to create their own not the governments job to take from those who create wealth to those who do not.

Also how dumb are you that the only ways you can have fun is spending money?  Or experiences like for ~8k you could have all the equip and money to hike the AT. for ~15K you could do the PCT.
