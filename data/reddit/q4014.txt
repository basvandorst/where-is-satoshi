Once it goes up by more of 15% of its price NEVERbuy. You buy the stable dip, not the shoot off.

Did you know you can make shapes on a
keypad? This is how I was able to change my passwords for my WoW account years ago everymonth without ever forgetting it.
159753 is an X
456852 is an + and so on. You literally don't have to remember ANY number except the shape. Mine were long as fuck too because of this. People looking at me typing them in always gasped until +UI explained how I did it.

It stops at 0.00000001 once it goes to 0.000000005 it just becomes 0.00000000 and thus non existant.

Generally, people around here are pretty retarded. They have all their hopes in Bitcoin which is kinda sad. You know they're struggling financially.

I don't understand. My Tx was 223 bytes and I paid 418 satoshies for it on 28/04. Yet, on that day it claims to have been 80sat/B thus my tx should actually have been 17k satoshies? But it wasn't? I remember first trying at 190sats but it wouldn't do it, so I just gave it 400 sats and it went.

I create a new account every few weeks and dump the old one. My last one lasted a week before I felt the need to dump it again. Have been doing this since 2013ish.

I'd like to be able to actually wear it as opposed to it just being a tshirt I wear at home. E.i. it needs style. None of these have this (nothing personal)
Just give it some flair, abstractness or something. Not just BITCOIN blandly on the chest.
Like such. Make it fun.

Yes. Thus. Make it on normal one write the numbers put in trezor. To unlock trezor, utter normal key pad, now user trezor.

Buying at whatever it drops to and keeps stable. I suspect €1.2k

So... can you just send those coins for the miners? Your 37.04, so you send to another address 36.98. Is that how it goes? The 0.04 is into a 0.06 miner fee? What about splitting it? Making another address for the 0.04 to go to and just forgetting it there? Can you not check that there if the wallet you use ever had been used?
