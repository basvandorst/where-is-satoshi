Please keep insulting me, much better then having a debate.
We aren't in a post-segwit environment, and changes like that really should need consensus. As far as I understand we are still debating whether or not this is a good idea.

Everyone who disagrees with you must be uninformed or stupid I see. I hate to break it to you but there are many of us who actually know what we are talking about and are against 1 meg blocks. 
If we are forced to use LN to use our bitcoins then we will once again be forced to go through the establishment to move our money. There is nothing decentralized about a LN. Don't get me wrong, LN will serve their purpose and be great, but only if they have affordable competition in the form of regular bitcoin payments.

RBF as well

Yup let's censor this guy before someone hears something Theymos doesn't approve of. No need to have a rational discussion.

Honestly the best solution to this 'problem', and I use quotes because it isn't yet a problem, is third party services. 
Start a company and start working with the miners. Create a service where you can submit bitcoin transactions and fix the tip. This could work a few different ways, but essentially you would offer an additional incentive to make sure a bitcoin transaction will go through. The nice thing about this is you could use this for transactions that were sent to you, but with too small of a tip
The problem with RBF is really simple. Say I send a transaction to myself (transaction A), and then send a transaction to you (transaction B). If I use RBF to increase the tip on transaction A, then transaction B becomes invalid. This is a really trivial way to do a double spend, and people will write apps that will do this trick for you automatically.

You are opening the door to fraud regardless, and worse you are condoning double-spends.

I would use RBF on my transaction, so in a sense I would be the merchant and I would agree, but the actual merchant would be screwed. Worse it wouldn't show up as a RBF transaction.
