Sad that people are shitting on our military and police. Traitors are trusting aristocracy agitators over their own country. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:53:13
I'm not. Trump is draining the swamp by showing us who the true patriots are.

Bitcoin core death spiral next week and it's crash to zero is going to be a wonderful wake up call to the anti-state folks. Can't wait. 
save your money and get to fiat:

**Wikileaks** has been classified by the US military and law enforcement as a **non-state intelligence agency working for a hostile foreign power.**
If you're still liking and sharing his stuff, you're getting pretty close to "traitor" in my book.

That's a long time to hodl

when you took your oath you took it to our constitution and our country. The military doesn't represent political parties. They represent us. Why do you think it's ok to attack our military?

Bitcoin is a community governed project. It's future is literally dictated by politics. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:10:36
Per our military and law enforcement Wikileaks is a non-state intelligence agency assisting a hostile foreign power. You're defending an enemy of america. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:52:37
It's the position of the armed forces and law enforcement. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:11:43
That's actually really interesting. Russia has the strongest social media machine right now. They could do some serious financial manipulation in the crypto world. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:17:32
You are defending an intelligence arm of a hostile foreign state that acts in the interests of the world wide aristocracy to diminish American geo-political power. 
Gargle more aristocracy nuts on the way out the door of our democracy; america doesn't want you.

good netsec tbh
google "bitcoin mempool tx fee"
and there are other sites that show same data

Why is it so hard to believe that some people put their country first? Not all governments represent the will of the people. Some of them, like russia, are controlled by the aristocracy, and their goals ARE to damage America. Supporting Assange is literally attacking America.

It's honestly as simple as that. You cannot with a straight face say he didn't actively help the Trump campaign. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:20:20
Da comrade. I mean... Y'all don't understand that them there Russians ain't got none of that cyber.

I need asthma medicine. The price disparity is huge. Like $300 to $30.
I honestly can't afford my fresh air addiction here in america.

The aristocracy and shareholder class don't "start businesses."
They siphon wealth off of workers productivity.

I dunnu why I mentioned it. They were the only results in Google when I searched FEC and BTC and they had a guide for politicians. I think it would be too much to ask for a political campaign with no paid staff to run and abide by all the FEC bullshit and run their own wallet.
Who is Mike?

If B2x is better for them financially, they aren't ideologues. Toward this, big money thinks long term. To really calculate their decisions we need to think of them as rational businesses.

I find the irony of libertarians love affair with cryptocurrency to be delicious. 
It all sounds great until one company hits 51% and starts making the rules to benefit themselves. Suddenly it's not a free market democracy. It's another monopoly forcing a tax on you. There is no difference between government taxing you and the largest BTC miners taxing you.
Except you can vote for government. BTC is going to be a cautionary tale about libertarianism.

TBH I just wanted to rant. Thank you for the thoughtful reply.
