I could be wrong but isn't segwit adoption like 12% so far? If bigger exchanges get on board with the update, it will increase overall adoption and nudge others to do the same resulting in better tech with lower fees for all. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:06:15
Yup, Nixon.

I know Iota isn't even based on blockchain tech, and it supposedly wouldn't have any issues that blockchain has. But LN will also resolve most of issues so I was just wondering. 
But yeah, Vertcoin seems to become obsolete after LN (I guess).

You mean that 'as long as there is a greater fool' thingy... I think we have enough of those to keep the prices growing for a few more years.

@_date: 2017-12-04 09:51:03
It's update to the tech. More people adopt it, it's better tech overall, meaning price goes up, equals more $$ for you..
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:57:21
Does it matter? If we are only looking at how many people owns bitcoin, it don't matter if its a few cents or few millions. In average, 14millions make 10mil volume, then 100mil volume is, in average, 140million users. 
But yeah, I agree it probably isn't a correct estimate, but the best I could think of. 
Still it gives a somewhat general idea.


This is true though.
@_date: 2017-12-13 14:37:40
The tech has value. 
Currency doesn't need to be a thing of value. Just a thing of exchange.

From what I understood, every transaction ever made is saved in blockchain, right? Won't that increase it's size overtime to be like.. humongous?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:02:59
BS, it's only one worth a damn from all the shitty kiddy superhero movies.

Few months ago people were saying it's always 18 months away. With recent news on it, it's just 'months away'. 
It *is* coming, don't delude yourself that it wont. (just because you invested in alt)
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:58:50


Why not?
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:49:11
Exactly the same as: Trader bets 1 million that BTC won't reach $50,000 by end of 2018
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:59:28




But still a lot above what you've thought/saw at 5-15 million that own bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:55


But if we're all wrapped in it, that it makes it safer to invest? :D Since noone will panic-sell, right?

This article says 13+ million users only on Coinbase 2 weeks ago.
Going by Coinbase(3.9) / Total market(37) volume in last 24h, Coinbase has 1.757 % of market volume.
Some math gives us (plz correct if wrong) 125 million users total.

How will Neo, Vertcoin and Iota fare when Lightning Network comes out?
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:59:44
I'm curious about thoughts and predictions. I don't get it why everyone thinks I expect facts as answers..
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:34:04
I feel that so many ppl are getting in now because they are confident that it always comes on top, and a huge percentage is HODLers. So maybe we won't be seeing correction after all.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:09:32
Imma HODLer. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:47:12


Ofc cause it's in it's infant phase. It's just started to seriously grow, both in price and adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:51:09
I wouldn't. I'm still curious of people opinions and thoughts while remaining sceptical about them.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:04:38
Does average Joe keep his lifesavings in a bank for xy years as inflation eats that up little by little while banks just printout more money? 
Does average Joe want to pay shitton of fees to the banks everytime he wants to send money to his kids?
When bank goes under?
Does average Joe not wanna get robbed of his paper money during the day?
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:01:00
Is the growth too fast for the technology to keep up? Are there any risks in that area currently?
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:31:26
Isn't people believing it will do well is the only reason it's being invested in? What other reason *is* there to invest it?
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:40:45
I don't think there would be a big crash. I know it's a psyhological limit and all that, but after it always continued to grow, together with all 40k+ in 2018 predictions, and HODLers, I don't see it dipping below 9k.

Hijacking for ELI5 request. So I just 'got' into this, and ummm, what's going on?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:10:36


As I said, I wan't this 'revolution' to succeed, for cryptocurrency to became the norm in the future and to make fiat money and banks obsolete.


But it needs to grow first. Then it will stabilize.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:02:36
What makes it the currency? Do you mean what are the benefits of bitcoin to current money?
Bitcoin, and cryptocurrency based on blockchain technology in general, when looking at any property of money, are an improvement to any existing money system.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:54:02
When I say it will do well I don't mean that price will do well. I mean that cryptocurrency and blockchain as an evolution of currency will do  well. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:28:59


You mean when that bitcoin will be worth +20% in a month?
Anyhow, it's in the grow phase currently. Of course it needs to stabilise, but that comes later.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:55:44
It's like you are pointing at an infant and saying he is growing too fast, he can't even go to the store and buy anything on it's own. 
Ppl need to realise that bitcoin is a NEW, GROWING, DEVELOPING tech. With incredible beneficial potential to entire humankind. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:10:37
Well yes, you can probably set a target value in dollars so it automatically updates to bitcoin as it's value changes. I doubt ppl do it manually every hour/day.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:39:39
For now. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:02:38
For now, but it is slowly being adopted. As it grows, adoption will grow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:01:56
What is this correction ppl keep talking about? ELI5
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:48:37
do explain
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:19:09
So will it dip after 10k? By how much? I've seen everything between no dip/just hodl, to 75%..
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:26:12
too soon
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:11:37


I may be a dreamer but I'm not the only one. 
I know it won't change quickly, it will take 10+ years. Bitcoin is leading now, sure another, better cryptocurrency may come along, but bitcoin is paving the way. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:24:57
In every property that money has, cryptocurrencies using blockchain technology are better than other money systems in use today. 
It's the evolution of money. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:55:30
Everyone sells bitcoin to get cash to buy shit?
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:34:44
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:26:31


It's circular, no? More people that invest in it increases the trust of other people.
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:56:47
This isn't about winning. As I said in other comment in this thread 


This is about evolution of currency, getting the banks and the current money systems obsolete, since I believe are one of the cancers of this world.
I believe in crypto, I want it to grow not simply for my profit, but for everyones benefit. It's price needs to grow in order for it's adoption to grow.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:10:23
What caused that latest dip?
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:44:31
It shows the advantages of using crypto. It's simply better. Not sure what else do you want. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 14:43:03
Wait wait you're confusing me. I think you got it wrong. 
Lets say you have 1 tortilla and you sell it for 1 bitcoin. In a month that bitcoin raises value by 50%. How is that not a good thing for you?
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:48:09


It is *being* adopted. It's only in small percentage at the moment. But as price and users grow, so will adoption.
@_date: 2017-11-28 13:30:23


Why would trust be gone? As price goes up, trust goes up, adoption goes up making price go up. I'm hoping it's circular reinforcing till it completely overtakes fiat money.
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:12:43
Ok few questions. 
Why would ppl be nervous because of price going up. Makes me happy, not nervous. 
Aren't limit orders (like on GDAX) only for buying below current price? Price falling should trigger limit orders for buying? Or am I getting something wrong?
