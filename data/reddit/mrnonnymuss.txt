There is a new website called [
You can buy bitcoins for cash or credit card, and the best part is there is no long wait to receive your bitcoins. 3 confirmation wait and the coins are yours! I have not found a better or easier way to buy bitcoins, other than verifying and linking your bank account (like I did) and purchase bitcoins.
If you use the above link, I make a tiny commision (so please click) and as a thank you, use this code **512AH262** for a 5% discount on your purchase!
Hope that helped. Enjoy!
