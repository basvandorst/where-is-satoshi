Bitcoin is an uncertain outcome, regardless of the shilling and confirmation bias this reddit eschews. Investing in it is a gamble, it's value fluctuates too wildly, it's cool you feel confident in BTC, and I hope you're right, BTC is neat, but it's not a certain thing, and hence a gamble

Well you said it yourself.

The past 5 years of instability. I'd like to see it be stable longer term, but there's no evidence to support long time stability in all the time it's existed, I'm not going to fall prey to confirmation bias because I'd like to see it happen. 
For example, in the past week BTC has fluctuated over 10% in value, 30% in the past week, etc. I see no evidence of any stability any time soon.

My comment about it being confirmation bias was aimed at the comment about it not being a lottery ticket, I don't believe it's going anywhere, at least not for the foreseeable future. However I also don't believe it's a sound investment long term. 
BTC is too unstable both short and long term to not be a risk, imo. There's clearly lots of money to be made by investing in BTC, but doing so is not a sure thing, framing BTC as a magical investment that will always make you money with no risks just hurts BTC and crypto by association, it makes us look like children playing at investing.

I'd bet they're cheaper than $4,617.28

I don't, I like Bitcoin. I'm just sick of reading cultish propaganda and confirmation bias. 
Comments like "BTC is stable" just make you (not you specifically) look like a fucking idiot, it's clear to even a child that it's in no way stable.

Yes, $1000 changes in a month are completely stable, barely even moved in price.

I'm not op so you just look like more of a twat now.
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:30:38
It's pretty simple, you're just being a twat.
