Where do you live?

Good support, yes.. A guy speaking English even called me after the problem was sorted out on qq to make sure everything worked as it should..

She will not be in trouble at all. The Chinese government doesn't care about your sister buying Bitcoin. They care about people blowing themselves up at Tiananmen Square.
I live in China.

Not rich at all - I am a very simple guy who likes to travel light through life without too much crap dragging me down. Don't even have an iPad and I use an old phone with a broken TP ;) ... I bought my first bitcoins in 2010 however (as far as I remember) and I have a small stash left (that I didn't cash out during the great panics (When I panicked too, hehe)).

I like the 21 idea.. :D ... will do that and accompany it with a nice letter about the wild west of bitcoin in 2013...

They problem isn't selling your coins. The problem is getting the money converted into fiat, so you can go buy that actual yacht instead of a inflatable boat from someone who accepts bitcoin at craigslist.

Didnt have any problems so far with BTC withdrawal, but decided to get out of there with my stash today and withdrew everything. So far nothing on the block chain even.

I did not think about that option, but that would actually be quite awesome..
@_date: 2013-11-21 16:54:08
I will try to do a buy next time I see this pattern. haha.. Should be interesting..

I am seriously considering going for some back alley trading business as it is now. I have lost some money, but mostly due to incompetent exchanges crashing and having problems with their engines causing delays.
It is both good and bad. 
Good, because it means this is still the wild west and things are still ramping up to become a full fledged currency with professional exchanges. 
Bad, because ... Money lost that shouldn't have been lost (but still in green for now)..
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:58:13
localbitcoins.com or buy at an exchange?

I had the same problem last week on mt.gox ... Smaller amounts were fine, but when I decided to withdraw my entire stash nothing happened.
I made a support ticket and headed over to their IRC channel. Turned out there was some issues and a lot of people were complaining..
Got my BTC after 48 hours.
@_date: 2013-11-07 09:42:55
Didn't have any problems earlier either with small amounts. Decided to get everything out of there today however.

Are there any countries that do not disclose banking info with the US. I am not American, so I do not know.
I have an account in a country, which will not disclose any info to the country that I happen to have a passport from (native born there - life elsewhere currently). Even have a Visa card from that bank..
@_date: 2013-11-14 09:59:14
I did not provide ID, when I used btce. Just transferred and money showed up within a couple of days.
@_date: 2013-11-14 06:12:19
Yes, Localbitcoins.com also has people selling/buying in China. Depends on where she live though. I live in a city with 15 mill people and there are only a couple of people active in this city.

There are a lot of options and depending on how much you have invested, a flight ticket to somewhere, where you can stash your loot, might be worth it. Just investigate...
For me it was Hong Kong, so it does't have to me some third world country, where you need protection or something like that. I had make up a nice story for the bank though - just moved here, flew in yesterday for my new job and looking for and apartment, etc etc... It can be done..
It just depends - investigate your options and go on a nice vacation. Beats trading anyway and you get to go on an adventure... :D
