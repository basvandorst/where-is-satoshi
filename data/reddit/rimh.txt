It is definitively their fault for choosing the evil option that is slightly and immeasurably less evil than the other.  Stop choosing evil. Or own it. The notion that evil people will stop being evil because its good is impressively naive.

Well. Fuck man. When you put it that way...

I know turnout is bad on non-presidential election years, but its still like 60% every 4 years. Not high. Right now most people will shit talk "politicians" or "Republicans" or "Democrats" but never the system itself.  Which is the actual problem. The more people treat it like the parasite it is and less like a noble but not quite perfectly functioning thing that they do now the better.

I'm with you. Something will have to change for any real improvements. It is good people are unhappy with it, because this is as good as it gets while we're using our current deal. Don't blame the products of the system (politicians) blame the system.

Oh i don't care about politicians' opinions. They know the system is fucked. I've worked at the state legislature level and a tiny bit at the Federal. They know exactly what is going on.
The people have to wake up. If they see 20% voter turn out AND see laws and such they find disgusting, maybe they'll question the auto-moral authority that Americans love to heap on their openly venal public sector.

You can blame voters, they're the ones giving up their power and authority. Politicians can do nothing without their constant support. The system is pretty broken, but either fix it or deal with it. If you choose to deal with it, don't pout.

Nope. I just think the sooner people stop voting the sooner turnout will drop which will make it more obvious that people don't support what's going on and a real conversation can happen instead of this incredibly fabricated and very artfully cultured hamster wheel we call partisan debate now.
When both parties agree on war and money and civil rights (now that gay marriage isn't a thing. Decided in the courts I might add) you know you have a fake debate and useless political discourse.
Sanders and all Republicans are super anti immigration.
Clinton and all Republicans are all super pro war.
No real conversation on the economy that is either reality based or even semi educated.
The candidates are so close to identical in every way that matters.
Voting for a douchey turd sandwich vs a shitty douche in a sandwich seem like especially shitty douchey options to me.

This really is on the voters. People who voted for Obama and got lied to and became disenchanted will just go out and vote even harder for Bernie/Clinton. Or just blame Republicans. Republicans are in the same boat, they're just in a desperate "anyone who can beat Hillary/Obama frenzy" as they have been for a long time.
People get evil shitty politicians because they continue to enthusiastically vote for evil shitty politicians. 
Any system that requires a bunch of very busy very ignorant layman to outmaneuver professionally amoral politicians, vicious lobbyists, and corporate election machinery is a broken ass system.  
Think about how hard it is to overcome all those obstacles and now imagine that American voters have to beat it every single election to achieve any kind of sustainable progress.
The system is broken not because of politicians, they're a feature not a bug. They allow your average college educated faux-concerned voter to export their moral authority into the willing maw of a Trump or a Clinton.

Wow, how long did he go to school for that? Brilliant legal mind.
