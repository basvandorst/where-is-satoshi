Banks aren't in the market of trading currencies, nearest you'd get are forex brokers. And if they get into the market, they'll probably be leveraged, shady as hell and ripping off the everyday investor.

I think ACH is just a standard US online bank transfer. A wire transfer (as OP did) is more expensive but will normally be quicker, such as 24 hours (or at least should be). Wires usually cost something like $20-30 each though.

Sue someone? Don't you mean just do a chargeback or a reversal?

No its not, that's a common misconception. All transactions are public on the blockchain. Once your bitcoin address is known it can be traced in terms of received and spent bitcoins. 
I believe its known which original blocks of bitcoin were mined by Satoshi but they haven't been moved/spent yet. As soon as those bitcoin are moved somewhere e.g. to a Bitcoin Exchange (where they can be exchanged for cash), it may be possible to trace them back. The exchange itself would of course have some record, especially if it was a large amount that went into the banking system.

Satoshi hasn't "cashed in" has he/she? As soon as that happens there'll be a trail. That's one of the main factors in this as far as I know.
@_date: 2015-12-10 04:35:49
Its very unlikely yes, but maybe they have just gained control of those servers recently. Although with Tor etc. and Satoshi's obvious infosec knowledge, I'm not sure its even possible.

Foreigners also had gold confiscated, and were forced to accept paper money for their gold. The Uebersee Finanz-Korporation, a Swiss banking company, had $1,250,000 in gold coins for business use. The Uebersee Finanz-Korporation entrusted the gold to an American firm for safekeeping, and the Swiss were shocked to find that their gold was confiscated.

It was during the great depression and was an attempt to prevent the hoarding of gold, and to stimulate the economy, rather than gold just sitting in someone's bank vault doing nothing.
Actually during this period, the currency had to be backed in part by gold. The govt couldn't just print an unlimited number dollars as they do now. So it kind of makes sense they had to do this.

Thats a bullshit figure put out by the FBI and represents the entire amount of all trades on BTC-e since they started operation. So you'd imagine that it includes a majority of legitimate trades.

People on here saying that if it's on the exchange it's not yours ... I don't buy this argument. If your bank was taken down due to shady dealings of one of the owners, how would you feel if the US Govt decided to take everyone's accounts balance in US dollars. That sounds crazy, and yet it's the same thing.

Markets decide how much its worth, just as the forex market decides how much a Euro, Dollar or Pound is worth. I agree with you though, it is in a bubble right now - people who say otherwise are fooling themselves. And I'd guess most people buying bitcoins recently are doing so out of pure speculation - they are betting on the price rising - that's one of the features of a bubble.

In my limited experience sending money overseas, banks are by far the worst option in Australia. Use travelex or someone similar ... When I used them they had a flat $25 fee and a half decent xrate. Just withdraw cash at your bank and go into travelex.
