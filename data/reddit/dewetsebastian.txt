Bitcoin core better develop a lot, quickly then. What utility does Bitcoin currently have that is superior and unmatched by altcoins? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:05:44
I don't actually agree with that entirely. It has the first mover advantage, sure. It copies Litecoin's successful implementation of new technology, which isn't a stupid thing to do. Bitcoin cannot be risked. Sure, it does have attention. How outdated is the technology then? How high do the fees have to be? How slow do the transactions have to be? Man, it's skyrocketing in price but no one can use it. Worst thing is that nobody cares! So, yeah what is the "best attention and developers" actually doing for Bitcoin? Surely the current situation is unacceptable and if they were so good they would do something.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:55:20
Spot on! Newer cryptos are better, BTC heavily overvalued. Thus it is a bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 15:08:14
Well, Litecoin? In what aspect is Bitcoin superior? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 13:46:57
It can? Nobody gives a fuck about the technology and practical use case. All it is, is people buying to get rich quick.

What differentiates Bitcoin though? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 06:35:55
Yes, specifically managed by institutions 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:04:38
Unhealthy imbalances will occur, for instance too many people might priorities a certain things. People might also not invest in something, because it may prove as a competition to their sector. It's a wonderful dream, but on closer inspection it becomes illogical. It warrants closer thought though, would be really awesome if one could make something like this work. 
@_date: 2017-08-26 18:34:21
And the people who can best judge where monet should be allocated is surely the government running the services? Not the individual speculating from the outside.  
Yeah, I mean we can all treat each other well and live wonderful lives. The Earth is rich with resources and we also don't need to have so many people, but unfortunately that's not how the world works. I think it's really important to accept that when discussing these matters. 
With that said, won't governments then be strongly incentived to ban cryptocurrencies? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 10:59:39
That's not what I'm asking. 
@_date: 2017-08-25 11:04:01
Tax is not necessarily a bad thing, it's necessary for a good country and overall wellbeing of the people. 
Taxes will always be involuntarily, think about the selfish nature of mankind. 
Aside from corruption etc, the current setup is actually quite good and critical to an economies success. Bitcoin will remove this? Transaction can be scattered across millions of keys without any form of identification.

What differentiates Bitcoin though? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:02:39
Good point, but what is protecting it from government intervention? How can the price still be so high with figures such as Trump opposing it? 
@_date: 2017-08-16 08:04:14
It might be the most secure blockchain, but securing what? Some form of gold with what purpose? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:10:23
It's kinda in the name? Bitcoin taxation? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 07:32:50
You're missing the point, digital cash then. The way in which we operate today, most people are paid and transact digital. Bitcoin adoption makes tax dodging significantly easier, which is a bad thing. Or does it not do this? Is this not a problem for the future of Bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-08-25 12:14:28
Due to corruption, but can you not see that it is vital? Who pays for the roads, the homeless, poor, sick people when the rest are too selfish to? The government, but with what money do run a country? Is stealing from the rich and giving the everyone really theft? 
@_date: 2017-08-26 20:34:31
Okay, but the value of Bitcoin will plummet if it becomes illegal. So, isn't the dream then dead? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:37:55
South African exchanges, much different than USD etc. A lot more price manipulation because of lower volumes etc. I can't buy with USD aside from using VirWox, which is really expensive.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:13:11
Haha it's not me man. It's a rich executive, he wants to invest in Bitcoin. Just small at first though, so he was wondering. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:15:12
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:33:00
Haha sick man, it's not actually me. I'm just thinking, I know someone who wants to get in. Though, he is afraid of that it might happen.  
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:34:34
Even at this price?
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:41:33
Project ubu? And yeah you're right. We have that going for us.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:33:18
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:27:47
What if they manage to sneak onto my laptop? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:40:49
Yeah haha, right before my trip to Europe. Just my luck. Yeah I think I'll see what happens at 10k and put a little bit in. Thanks for the advice. 
You too bra :) 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:35:50
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:42:50
I'll see what happens at 10k :).  I think then I'll start doing that. There might be a big sell off. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:09:39
What percentage of all money does gold entail? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:16:27
Not mine, but you can open exodus while for instance I'm away at lunch. Then you send everything over, or maybe someone steals my laptop. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:26:50
Does it allow you do that? 
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:37:13
I wish it could, but economically it doesn't make sense. Think about what fuels the economy, spending. Governments even take out debt to ensure that this happens. With Bitcoin, spending is not encouraged. What will fuel the economy then? 
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:27:19
Alternative? That can be said about pretty much anything, you know that it is only our current perception. 
@_date: 2017-10-12 11:03:46
Maybe we should rethink economics and try to find a solution with our current Bitcoin? At the moment, I'm just not that optimistic about Bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies and blockchain technology is amazing though. 
To comment, think about the economy. As the entire economy crashes due to no spending, banks will struggle to claim back loans and also to lend money.
