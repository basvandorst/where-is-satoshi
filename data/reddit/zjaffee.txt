I called them and they have a fairly strong fraud protection algorithm, maybe too strong.

As long as new blocks are being mined the practical value of BTC is going down at this constant rate. The only reason the prices go up is because new people are entering the market, or maybe the current economy (ie tech workers), has left people with a glut of cash to invest and they are putting it into crypto currency.

I disagree, because at the end of the day the platform that BTC and really all crypto currency today is priced in is dollars, or some other government backed currency.
The Fed can work together with the Treasury to issue a new type of dollar that is entirely digital, where they control new coins being added. This isn't about being the most popular platform anymore, as much as it is about creating a secure digital currency, whose value won't be volitile and will be backed by governments.

The fed will set the price, possibly first only giving it away to their shareholders, the banks,are theall it United States Dollars, or USD.
The truth is, is that the vast majority of dollars in circulation are already digital. The federal reserve keeps a ledger of all of the money they give out to banks, followed by banks keeping track of the money given to you. This would just give the individual consumer to directly interface with the general ledger.

Except for the fact that the way you would withdraw such currency would be by going to your current bank account and withdrawing it as dollars. Maybe buy from the federal reserve is a wrong term, I mean exchange their current cash holdings for digital cash holdings.

While I'm not certain the magazine is about this, etherium is a huge deal. Major corporations such as IBM have invested in it, as smart contracts are the future of payment processing.
