Or maybe he wants to buy some btc and realized how easy it is to manipulate the market. As most view this downtrend as a threat, some like myself view it as an opportunity to buy some more. They can't make this a daily or weekly thing to constantly say "bitcoin is bad". They will need to come up with new ways to drop the price.

One day people will wake up and realize that crypto was made to be anti-government. When that happens, a rumor like this or actual news of a government banning anything wont make a difference. We value bitcoin, we decide if we use bitcoin and we decide who to sell it to. They can shut down exchanges and exchanges can open in 3rd and 4th world countries, what do?
The only reason i am not actively trading atm is because the amount of people who are what the gov even thinks of crypto is too damn high! 
The only way to stop crypto is for the government to hack every phone, every PC and somehow every paper wallet lol. It is a joke that a single human being involved in crypto even cares.

You have to realize one thing that history has proven over and over again. If it goes up too fast, make your money and get out and wait for the next dip. This is unhealthy, too many people and even institutions in this for a quick buck. This whole system was not made as a "get rich quick" scheme, it was made to change the world.

Well you are living in a delusion so you can have whatever you want. All green days for you, not like the market cap dropped by almost 45% in 1 week.

people ARE dumb. Anyone with a twitter account with a more than a thousand followers can dump this whole market. We have been seeing this since Friday. A simple unconfirmed rumor started a chain reaction and people lost thousands at least. They keep forgetting that WE give value to bitcoin and WE do not care what a scumbag like JPM CEO has to say because WE are bitcoin. Most people have not realized that this system is Decentralized, when they do (which is never) this will stop happening.
