thanks for citing. devil's advocate: from a ancap standpoint, aren't they providing a valuable service to the market, and only remitting that money due to duress from the government under threat of theft of kidnapping or violence?

For anyone curious, the downside to address shortening is that you have to trust the shortening service to always resolve to the full address.
This may not happen, even with the best intentions of owner of the shortening service provider due to a myriad of reasons.
This could allow potential replacement of the intended address to a different address, intercepting bitcoin and sending it to a different address.

just to clarify, imo:
No, basically Bitcore is designed to be a nice tool to let developers access in a distributed, remote, client-server way the low-level bitcoin stuff very well to still be able to create cool things for bitcoin.
It is much more than just knowledge of it or not. It is decoupling and  abstracting, useful for scaling and black-boxing.

from a security perspective, this is not good enough imo. i'm not saying i have the right answer. perhaps the right answer is something similar to the casascius short address.
or maybe just generating short addresses which are patterned closely off of the target address:

then at least any software and humans could do at minimal checking to make sure it is resolving to a correct-looking address.

The politicians are put there to give you the idea that you have freedom of choice. You don't. You have no choice. You have owners. They own you. They own everything. They own all the important land. They own and control the corporations. They've long since bought and paid for the Senate, the Congress, the statehouses, the city halls. They've got the judges in their back pockets. And they own all the big media companies, so that they control just about all of the news and information you hear. They've got you by the balls. They spend billions of dollars every year lobbying ­ lobbying to get what they want. Well, we know what they want; they want more for themselves and less for everybody else."

They're not interested in that. That doesn't help them. That's against their interests. They don't want people who are smart enough to sit around the kitchen table and figure out how badly they're getting fucked by a system that threw them overboard 30 fucking years ago. 
 
"You know what they want? Obedient workers ­ people who are just smart enough to run the machines and do the paperwork but just dumb enough to passively accept all these increasingly shittier jobs with the lower pay, the longer hours, reduced benefits, the end of overtime and the vanishing pension that disappears the minute you go to collect it. And, now, they're coming for your Social Security. They want your fucking retirement money. They want it back, so they can give it to their criminal friends on Wall Street. And you know something? They'll get it. They'll get it all, sooner or later, because they own this fucking place. It's a big club, and you ain't in it. You and I are not in the big club."

yes, sorry, maybe you misunderstood, I never said what you inferred there. just because it is open source it does not imply it is trustworthy. we are on the same page. but by something being closed source does make it inherently absent of the capability of trust, for security and privacy.

How is Gyft integrated directly with the sellers? You have to download their app, buy a limited good with bitcoins from their preselected list, and of those, Gyft is only usable at some of the locations, pay Gyft's fee, and to get a gift certificate.
Vs bitspend, one fee, one transaction, your preferred goods directly, with no other restrictions.
seems like bitspend has the better deal.

no need to email twice. upon forgot password, give a blind success message not indicating if a user account exists or not, and if it does, email the user telling them a password reset has been requested, and if they want to they can click the link. the link will be HTTPS to your site, with a unique token at the end.

sorry, i imagine your POS accepts Bitcoin from any wallet that the State allows. I am not sure you have a choice on that, but ultimately the State will say "oh that's a money laundered wallet, you can't take their money. Oh they have a Silk road transaction in their history. No can do. Oh they didn't report that bitcoin address on their income taxes, it is an illegal transaction. If you accept it, you are helping the terr'ists."

this is very moot after seeing blockchain's response to security issues as well as their evasion on the question of their interaction with law enforcement.

We are making some changes to our service, internally. A delicate surgery like this cannot be done while moving, so we need to stop the bus for a couple days. For more information, please see our reddit post.
The Bitspend Team will not be processing orders until then.
We have some great new changes on the way! We appreciate your patience with us while we get them put in place. No worries though guys, we're not going to be gone, so if you have a support issue that needs attention you can still contact us :)

further than that, we have to trust no state or corporate entities want to put restrictions on the blockchain also saying certain transactions from certain addresses or associated with addresses are invalid ("tainted") and therefore are discarded. I think we're already seeing this with Mt. Gox, aren't we?
as the blockchain becomes ever increasingly larger, this will continue to be a problem as our decentralized service becomes centralized and we fall prey to the very factors we ran from.

"That decentralized nature is the central concern of detractors, who call it a sort of geeky Ponzi scheme that will collapse when the novelty wears off. When the price of Bitcoin fell by $100 in a few hours on April 10, those fears seem realized – imagine if the $100 in your wallet was suddenly worth only $60 – but its value has been more stable in recent weeks."

Manda Bala (Send a Bullet) is a U.S. documentary film directed by Jason Kohn about corruption and kidnapping in Brazil.
Kohn has said "I really thought of Manda Bala as a non-fiction RoboCop depicting a very real, broken, and violent society." [1] It premiered January 20, 2007 at the 2007 Sundance Film Festival where it won the Grand Jury Prize for Documentary and the Excellence in Cinematography award. It had a limited release in North America beginning on August 17, 2007. On March 18, 2008, Manda Bala won the award for Outstanding Achievement in Nonfiction Feature Filmmaking at the inaugural Cinema Eye Honors.
a victim of a kidnapping who had her ears cut off goes into detail about how her captors made her sleep in cramped quarters with only a bucket to use the bathroom, a TV blaring Hitchcock films, and how they sent pieces of her ear to her family.

From 1992:
A specter is haunting the modern world, the specter of crypto anarchy.
Computer technology is on the verge of providing the ability for individuals and groups to communicate and interact with each other in a totally anonymous manner. Two persons may exchange messages, conduct business, and negotiate electronic contracts without ever knowing the True Name, or legal identity, of the other. Interactions over networks will be untraceable, via extensive re- routing of encrypted packets and tamper-proof boxes which implement cryptographic protocols with nearly perfect assurance against any tampering. Reputations will be of central importance, far more important in dealings than even the credit ratings of today. These developments will alter completely the nature of government regulation, the ability to tax and control economic interactions, the ability to keep information secret, and will even alter the nature of trust and reputation.
The technology for this revolution--and it surely will be both a social and economic revolution--has existed in theory for the past decade. The methods are based upon public-key encryption, zero-knowledge interactive proof systems, and various software protocols for interaction, authentication, and verification. The focus has until now been on academic conferences in Europe and the U.S., conferences monitored closely by the National Security Agency. But only recently have computer networks and personal computers attained sufficient speed to make the ideas practically realizable. And the next ten years will bring enough additional speed to make the ideas economically feasible and essentially unstoppable. High-speed networks, ISDN, tamper-proof boxes, smart cards, satellites, Ku-band transmitters, multi-MIPS personal computers, and encryption chips now under development will be some of the enabling technologies.
The State will of course try to slow or halt the spread of this technology, citing national security concerns, use of the technology by drug dealers and tax evaders, and fears of societal disintegration. Many of these concerns will be valid; crypto anarchy will allow national secrets to be trade freely and will allow illicit and stolen materials to be traded. An anonymous computerized market will even make possible abhorrent markets for assassinations and extortion. Various criminal and foreign elements will be active users of CryptoNet. But this will not halt the spread of crypto anarchy.
Just as the technology of printing altered and reduced the power of medieval guilds and the social power structure, so too will cryptologic methods fundamentally alter the nature of corporations and of government interference in economic transactions. Combined with emerging information markets, crypto anarchy will create a liquid market for any and all material which can be put into words and pictures. And just as a seemingly minor invention like barbed wire made possible the fencing-off of vast ranches and farms, thus altering forever the concepts of land and property rights in the frontier West, so too will the seemingly minor discovery out of an arcane branch of mathematics come to be the wire clippers which dismantle the barbed wire around intellectual property.
Arise, you have nothing to lose but your barbed wire fences!

if you think i did that intentionally, your paranoia is worse than mine. i can't even think of what i would have to gain by doing that.

thank you i found an untrusted party but really wanted something integrated inti bitcoin. that would be a really neat feature to have.
@_date: 2013-10-13 07:23:59
also you are still running untrusted code on your computer, does that not concern you? i know there is an argument that you probably already are, but why add another one if you can help it?

hey are you aware of the upside down text bug in chrome?

I've announced it several times in the past and by meetup.com

amusing as it is based on HTTP which means a simple MITM attack could inject JS to steal the message. I guess this is not about that kind of security/privacy though.
That being said a CA attack on HTTPS would have the same effect.

a browser addon can easily manipulate the page content, and capture all form data
@_date: 2013-12-20 08:25:59
as far as i know that is not open source and therefore all claims about security cannot be verified.

also, to anyone else reading this, not to you fyeah as i imagine you've already unsubscribed to anything i have to say,
it is more than just protecting your wallet data which may be encrypted already, there is also the concern of a backdoor or other evil features in the closed source software, if not now, perhaps automatically updated in the future at the whim of an Agency.

then we're right back to the centralized power authority which can censor anything it wants to, or anything it feels it has to in order to satisfy the State or corporations. just buy from people you trust in the first place.
edit: already bitpay refuses to service porn or other merchants, and they get to decide what that means.
if anything we need the opposite of bitpay which is open source and decentralized.

what horrible mock security. it should be on a computer that is offline, like off of a linux live cd.
@_date: 2013-10-23 07:23:34
why must there be a "legit" way? why does other people with more guns than you saying it is okay make it okay? what matters is the quality of the information, start there. ratings systems, webs of trust, online tests, anonymous identity verification systems, that is the answer. why would you want people who regularly torture, arrest, harass, and murder endorsing and controlling the way people are delivered medical information?
