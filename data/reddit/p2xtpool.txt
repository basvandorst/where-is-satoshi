30 btc. I guess I'd just have to pull through the shame. We should put it to the test. Just to see how I cope with such hardship.

Funny how suddenly doubling to quadrupling the bandwidth requirement is fine now with SW because it's a prereq for LN, whereas 1MB blocks were somehow already too big when talking about raising the limit.
@_date: 2015-12-03 16:06:08
So if I mine blocks where I set the difficulty to almost nothing and make 500 blocks with my cpu, what do you think will happen?

Just answering your question.


Right back at you
@_date: 2015-12-01 11:57:44
Those specifics are clearly not the issue here
@_date: 2015-12-31 08:58:00
What about the fact that doing SW as a soft fork is highly controversial? Many of the bitcoin devs, and several software devs in general, myself included, clearly see how dangerous it is to do a messy soft fork instead of a clean gard fork. 
You can't just ignore the other side of the table and claim that something has full agreement when your decision will massively affect the other side. 
@_date: 2015-12-30 11:19:01
And with a soft fork you just downgrade everyone from full node to spv node, without telling them. Do you think we have 5.5k full nodes right now? Because we absolutely do not. We have maybe around 3k, the rest are spv nodes. Just one hard fork, and security for light wallets would increase tremendously. 
@_date: 2015-12-12 00:11:40
Depends on how you define "the same"
input, 1btc
output 1, 0.5btc
change output, 0.5btc - fee
Same addresses, but the amount that goes to the change can vary.
@_date: 2015-12-12 09:45:50


That would have to be decided


Either you are in a store buying stuff, and they probably have cameras, or you are buying online and have to provide name and address for shipping.
If you are dead set on scamming people like this, it's easier to just do reversals on MasterCard and claim it was stolen.
@_date: 2015-12-29 20:25:49
Unless I'm mistaken, the stratum protocol works like that, yes
@_date: 2015-12-03 20:43:49


Depends on how you define it. Any chain can survive forever as long as someone mines on that particular chain. That doesn't mean that anyone will accept tokens on that chain.
If one bitcoin mining pool refuses to switch to BIP101 even after activation, they will simply keep extending the dead chain. Anyone running current versions of core will accept it as the longest valid chain, but nobody will accept bitcoins mined on their chain.
@_date: 2015-12-01 12:51:02
This is straight up not true. I run a p2pool node on XT on my home computer. It's not an expensive computer at all, and it was already on 24/7 before I set up the pool. Running a node and pool added no cost at all.

Of all the things I could try to scam with bitcoin, steamkeys are the last thing. Valve will assrape your entire account, lol
@_date: 2015-12-12 12:49:58
My point is that every time we see this, the small block defenders say that users should use better wallets, or link the tx and say "look, you only paid x fee". If they had paid more fee or used a different wallet, all the people that they bypassed will now be here with the same issue. Are you going to tell them the same thing?

Okay, first of all, an implementation clearly wouldn't allow that. Second, a transaction of any non trivial size would never be accepted on 0 conf. Third, do you think we live in a world with no consequences? You could just walk away with your wares after double spending like that, and nobody would care?

Soft fork is a hack. Hard fork is a lot cleaner for the code
@_date: 2015-12-03 19:46:36
The validity of a block is in the eye of the beholder.
You could argue that no block is invalid. It's just the nodes ruleset that is different.
If 99% of the mining power started mining BIP101 blocks, but no exchange and no user ran Bitcoin XT or other BIP101 node, then the bitcoin blockchain would just have lower hash power, and BIP101 would be it's own, much stronger and more secure fork.
@_date: 2015-12-29 19:39:32


Mining is centralized mostly in China because it has cheap electricity.
They can keep mining there because even with the GFW, 1MB blocks can be handled.


@_date: 2015-12-29 19:59:08
I would think that the Chinese are more resourceful than "oh, blocks are too big for the GFW, I guess we can all go home now".

Thanks. Looks like they accept 0 conf, and like expected, we are talking very low amounts here. Sure, you can double spend, but are you really going to for so little?

There is only room for n transactions in a block. Everyone raising fees = everyone pays more and everyone keeps the same place in the queue.

Acknowledged. You agree to the change and have tested that it works. 
@_date: 2016-01-17 17:38:29
What you do is that you only allow the current chain to include the coinbase transaction. Then you also include information about the merged chain, so that new clients will know about that new chain, and that all transactions are in that chain instead. Old clients will only see empty blocks. In this new chain, there are no rules (as viewed by old nodes). In there, you can remove the block size limit, pay 100btc in reward pr block, whatever you want really. Old nodes just see the empty block on the original chain.
@_date: 2016-01-27 06:22:56
I'm also first now becoming worried. Bitcoin is supposed to be free, open, and not controlled by anyone. Seems that the last part is fading away as Core is putting themselves in more and more power. If we cannot do a fork with Classic or any other implementation, we are only letting the world know that a government takeover of Bitcoin is as simple as getting hold of a handful of developers, because the community won't dare to use a different implementation.

For large organizations, this is a non issue, seriously. Anyone depending on running a full node most likely follows development anyway, *especially* if they run custom code on top of the full node. If they don't, then it's just installing and running.


Yeah. How long do you think it would have taken if they had seen an alert a few months ahead of time?
Testing must be done, of course, but that is before release. When the code is released it starts flagging new version blocks, so you don't really have much more time to test.
Both the fork flag day and the alert activation date could be calculated from when the first new block was mined. That date plus x months will be fork date. Date of first mined block, will be the alert date.
@_date: 2016-01-15 07:27:21


I do not believe Satoshi would say this. Why? because that's the same thing as declaring that bitcoin is centralized. The ultimate decentralization is that any one single developer can fork the entire community over to his or her chain, and any other developer can fork it from that one over to theirs.
The ***only*** thing that should matter, is the actual code that is being written.

Core is an open source project, Blockstream is a for profit company. Many of the most influential people working on Core is also employed by Blockstream, and thus has a financial incentive to make Core a product that serves Blockstreams goals.
If Blockstream makes money, Core devs make money. Blockstream makes money when they can provide services that bitcoin cannot. If bitcoin provides those services, Blockstream becomes redundant. Which leaves many Core devs out of paid work, or at least reduces profit.
Hang on... You don't even realize Core and Blockstream are basically the same, do you?

Coinbase is for a hard fork. Classic is currently basically only that. A hard fork to increase capacity. Adam just had a meeting with miners where he expressed that "no hard fork must happen!"
So how do you think this new meeting can be anything other than Adam trying to force Coinbase to accept his rule?

People are banned over nothing, both on and many also on bitcointalk.org, simply for expressing opinion on Everyone promoting anything that does not come from Core are character assassinated, called conspiracy theorists and worse.
Core devs, some more than others, are claiming to want to "get consensus", and "come to agreement", yet **everything** that is not made by Core is removed from all discussion forums with extreme prejudice.
Example: thinblocks. Discussion was allowed here for a long time, but then the op edited his post to say that this functionality was implemented in Bitcoin Unlimited. Literally seconds later, the thread was removed.
So please, *please*, tell me. Do you sincerely believe that all those things you say, only come from people who support Classic?

I don't pay anything extra for swiping my credit/debit card at the time of swiping. So as a "people", I see it as free.

From the discussion:


What's wrong with XT's method of discarding a random transaction so that you can't predictably manipulate the mempool?


 It makes it trivial to DoS the network, among many other issues.
Disregarding the typical "because reasons" response;
I think this PR makes it a LOT easier to DoS attack the network. After this patch, receiving BTC will be a massive pain at any point where there is any backlog. Both setting a higher min relay fee AND dropping low fee tx's from mempool, combined with miners probably setting a low total pool size to keep latency low...
Merging this while not having either full support for replace by fee and/or bigger blocks, is borderline insanity.

Ironically, they seem deathly afraid of decentralization by using the biggest Chinese miners as a reason why bigger blocks are bad. Because China has bad latency. If orphan rate becomes so bad for them, then they have to move the mining elsewhere, and the whole network would gain from that.

*Lets say I have 2 bitcoin nodes. One, I connect directly to your node, and thousands of others. The other node, I connect directly to, and only to, all miners I can get the IP of. Then I send one high fee transaction to myself relayed directly to the miners, then I send one normal fee transaction to you and the rest of the network.
Without RBF or people running Bitcoin XT, you will never know about what I have done. If you accept 0-conf, you are shit out of luck. With RBF, you will instantly know that you will not get this payment.*

And misrepresenting legit users as spam (like Luke's opinion on everyone using bitcoin) is way worse. Sorting by fee is a great way to open up an attack vector by letting an attacker know exactly what to do to push out any given transactions with less than x fee/byte
@_date: 2015-10-22 04:51:12
You missed the key part where the new transaction only bumps fee. Same receiver, just a higher fee

I don't have to update my firmware. And when I do, I check the source code and verify the signature before installing it. You cannot fake that

False. As with everything, we won't have more than what we need. Even right now, I would guess that 90% of full nodes are run on sheer altruism, not because of a need. If actual need arises, more will step up with better hardware.


Is that so? Then why are we catering to the most centralized of all of them? Even BIP101 was modified because the Chinese didn't want to go over 8MB. In your first breath you want to decentralize, but in the very next, you want to protect the central miners. So which is it gonna be?


Because if someone would do such a thing, we would already have seen an xTB backlog. We disagree on definition. You see it as an opening, I see it as closing the opening that 1MB is.
Define "large miner". [I wrote a post on that some time ago.](

Quite the opposite. Unlike everyone else here, I'm not assuming that we will never get adoption. You are talking about a transitory state as if we will never be in a position where there is no spam, only around 1-2 legit tx/s. I'm assuming both adoption *and* spam. Note that I don't think it's actually spam, because they pay fees, and it removes the concept of permissionlessness, which I think is an integral part of bitcoin.
If we have both adoption and spam, *and* a restrictive blocksize limit like we have now, there will never be safety in sending a transaction, because however big fee you pay, there is well enough time before a block will be found that you can be pushed out of the mempool even if you paid the highest fee of all current tx's.

Because they cannot stop me from running my own full node, and if their payment to me does not validate on my node, it has no value to me, making all their mining a waste of time and money 
@_date: 2015-10-22 15:57:31
As long as we have the 1MB limit, it's actually a lot cheaper to attack than before. It could even be profitable for miners to flood the network, because now there is also code for dropping old transactions, so you just fill up the mempools, force fees up above your spam, and wait for your transactions to drop.


Assuming we never get any adoption, that is.

Unfortunately, the assumption is that fees will be 0 if we have unlimited block space. That is absolutely wrong, first because if it was correct, all transactions today would have 0 fees, and second, because orphan blocks happen more often with bigger blocks.
The entire post falls apart just from that.

It's a false assumption that a dictator is by definition a bad person. It simply means "someone in charge". Bitcoin Core has basically a double layer dictatorship. Wladimir is in the end the guy that makes decisions, call him dictator, maintainer, or whatever, still the same role. The second layer is dictatorship by the software in itself, where it has almost full market control. And that's fine. People can run what software they want.
But. There have not been a large scale political DDoS against core nodes. There have not been any core nodes hiding as XT nodes to survive. There *have* been core implementations that specifically targets and removes XT nodes and blocks from the network. Mike being a maintainer for XT does not give him control over bitcoin. At least not to the same degree that Wladimir has control over it

The logic for a fee market is flawed. If a transaction was confirmed at the time of sending, it would make sense. But you can never know if after you have submitted your tx, there will come a large number of tx's with a higher fee that push you out.
@_date: 2015-11-07 16:35:13
Is it? If you truly believe that 75% is not enough for consensus, then how can you believe in the security of bitcoin? You are literally saying that you think bitcoin is unsafe if 25% of mining power doesn't follow the rest.

I wish I sucked less at (and used more) linux, or that setting up and building in Visual Studio didn't take a year of failing. Would really like to run XT with your RBF patch on Windows. Managed to make it work in linux once, but I have no machine to run it on.

Default behavior is to resubmit unconfirmed wallet txs every x minutes right? 
@_date: 2015-11-26 08:28:12
That TX still has to either have all the combined in and outputs, or that metadata must be sent elsewhere, which drastically reduces security and increases complexity

Lol, you instantly crash your own arguments. Point one. Move transactions off chain. Point two. Missing fees kill miners. Well, what do I know, I'm just an XT supporter. The logic for dismissing my opinion is scientifically sound. 
@_date: 2015-10-21 19:58:56
How will that work with a transaction being kept in a lot of other pools? Won't it just get added again as soon as the miner sees it after drop? I think it won't be feasible to keep a record of dropped tx's for future rejection.

If he is such a privacy extremist, I would've thought he had read enough to know that 1, the functionality he's talking about can be turned off, and 2, if revealing your ip is deanonymizing, running a full node isn't for you, because you cannot connect to anyone without doing just that. 
@_date: 2015-11-16 21:50:58
Nowhere do I make that suggestion. There is no provable causation in that regard. You just state it as a fact without backing it up. And to top it off, you make it as if I'm the one saying it, and with the finishing cherry, it's a theoretical situation where 8GB blocks are created even before BIP101 allows it. Go troll somewhere else, thanks.

Yeah that's cool if you are on the sending end.
Say you are waiting for your exchange withdrawal that was sent with a low fee because the exchange pays the fee and don't want to spend a lot, or is not running latest software.

It's not that hard. 
Step one. Realize that there are millions of people with mega or gigabit internet connections.
Step two. Realize that many of them can easily pay for more storage than the blockchain can use up, and are willing to do so. Yours truly included. 
Step three. Don't try to use the argument that if limit is removed, the first and all blocks after will be 100GB large. It's utter bullshit and we all know it.
