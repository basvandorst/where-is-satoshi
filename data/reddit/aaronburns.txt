My only critique would be notifications. There is a free app out there that has greater than and less than notifications, it's pretty ugly as far as UI goes but it works. I'll buy yours when it has notifications. You could probably do some nice Instawallet implementations too.

I found his post informative. r/bitcoin is usually the first place that I hear news like this. Keep up the good work OP.

Actually H1098 is designed to get rid of "legal tender." It's designed to allow competing currencies created by private entities in the United States. Because bitcoin is completely decentralized and doesn't belong to anyone one country it's not really that important for the community. The only thing that it will do for bitcoin is allow people to see competing currencies as valid.
Check out the Sound Money Hearing video for more information. Bitcoin is discussed by George Mason University's Dr. White.
