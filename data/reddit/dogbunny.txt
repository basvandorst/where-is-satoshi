I like to visualize it like a string of pearls on a necklace or something like [this]( --maxing out to the limit when we need it, being the right size for demand.

But the Euro may take a hit when the default happens, wouldn't you be able somewhat protect yourself, then buy back into the Euro, or whatever currency the Greeks opt for, at a better rate than if you just sat on your Euros?

Momentarily, they will coexist like Neanderthal and modern man. We'll see how it pans out. Some private blockchain with the veneer of trust will go bust with lots of finger pointing -- no one will be punished and bitcoin will chug along. Eventually, bitcoin becomes the safe bet and banks become the gamble.

I'm all for spending, but the reality is there aren't enough places, where I live, to spend regularly. I'm happy to spend on the Internet, but I can only use so many pairs of alpaca socks. I live in southern Japan, in a moderately large city, but there is not even one place to spend them. We really only need one or two stores with many locations to start accepting them, like a convenience store chain. I'd be happy to buy my morning coffee there everyday.

Besides price, are there significant differences between the $20,000 Bitcoin ATMs and the Skyhook thousand-dollar ATM? (real question)

It doesn't have to be a bad thing. Some of them are going to fight it, but some of them will see the inevitability of change and choose to swim with the current.

That seems to ignore the store of value as a function of Bitcoin. It isn't just a tool for commerce.

For those of you aghast at how WU is being treated. Let's look at the reality of how this company functions. Especially in relation to remittances.
The average salary of a maid in Hong Hong (typically a foreign worker) makes about 500USD a month. They send this home via WU. WU takes ten percent.
Draw your own conclusions and make your own judgements on how this business model benefits society. Sure, they provide a service--an inefficient, overpriced service.
They have what amounts to a monopoly, that benefits greatly from poor, unbanked individuals.
I won't weep for WU. Their time has past and I'm happy to hasten their demise. I'm happy that this new technology has the potential to make real improvements in the lives of people who could use it.

Interestingly, in the States I used to sell blood plasma regularly for gas money. I guess plasma and platelets sales have a moral high ground. Though, they did reduce payments over time.

I've heard/read several places that because bitcoins are of a limited supply they will be traded like other commodities, however I was interested in what could be predicted about the bitcoin market in the long-term.
Two things in-particular: 1) a bitcoin, unlike a gold coin, could be infinitely be sliced into smaller pieces and 2) with more and more merchants accepting bitcoin, the utility of bitcoin will surely outweigh that of gold over time. 
How will these two aspects effect the trading / inflation of bitcoin in the mid to long term?

I wonder how many Americans in 1990 thought is was unlikely that they would ever use the Internet.

I'm still buying, if it goes below 300 that's just a bonus. Mostly, I just use cash I would normally waste on some random other purchase--a little here, a little there.

I liked it. It was well done and to the point. I'm all for anything that makes the concept more accessible.
@_date: 2015-01-04 12:04:23
A couple of random things. The way this would effect the market would depend on how and when they cash out to pay their bills. Also, it would depend on if they were acquiring their electricity in an above board way.
@_date: 2015-01-12 23:21:23
It doesn't have to be an all or nothing proposition. Trade can grow organically much like the M-Pesa in Africa. A person could receive their Bitcoin remittance, spend it where they are able to (ex. A local grocer that accepts it), then only cash out for what can't be paid for in bitcoins. Over time, with mass adoption, less needs to be cashed out.

Maybe I don't understand the technology well enough, but in theory if a miner turned off some of its machines, doesn't that mean its hashing power, daily output of coins, and overhead costs decrease? If the miners all did it, that is. Thanks for responding.

Or as Japanese investigators have suggested, not that at all.

Isn't the short answer that people are no longer buying bitcoin, they are buying with bitcoin?

HK and the Philippines are great markets--heck, anywhere Filipinas are working. The Middle East also has a sizable population. Filipinas are taking care of other people's kids all over the globe. It kind of reminds me of the things Partick Bryne has said in relation to financially empowering women.

Keep it mostly. No shops near me accept it. I do some online shopping with it.

I know. I was just kidding. It is interesting that you decided to get out with a slight loss. It just seems you were able to accept a guaranteed profit or a slight loss. I'm curious what your dinner conversation about bitcoin will be in say 10 years time? We can rationalize for holding or for getting out, only time will tell. Best of luck.

What is stopping miners from just cutting production like OPEC to reduce supply and bolster the price? Fear others will out-mine them? Lack of consensus among miners?

The cool thing about tipping servers in bitcoin is that they are already familiar with working the system by under-reporting their tips to avoid taxes. For them, this is just another way to keep more of what they've made.
@_date: 2015-08-27 12:11:16
So if the difficulty can increase or decrease, why is it a bad idea to have block sizes increase or decrease depending on demand (backlog of confirmations)?
edit: like if instead of setting the block size, you set the rate at which confirmations should be made, and then adjusted the block size to stay within the ideal rate.

You don't even need to read the article. Based on the headline, it's pretty obvious the author doesn't understand the technology.

Bitcoin is inextricable from the future of fintech. All that's needed is another major city/state to step in with a more liberal policy. NY regulators can keep on with the rent-seeking behavior, Fintech will evolve elsewhere.

Of course, the question is, how many of the new wealthy elite will manage to hold onto their wealth? It is more likely the new found wealth will be lost as a result of human stupidity than because of some great conspiracy.

I really knew next to nothing about investing when I bought some bitcoins. I still know almost nothing about markets, investing etc. But, I really think the concept of "reversion to the mean" is important to help people keep their sanity and not go bankrupt. It is still exciting to watch the bull run.

Disclaimer: I don't hold a substantial portion of the total bitcoin in circulation, but I agree with @_date: 2015-03-19 23:33:56
People really just need personal, selfish, reason to start using it and they will. My totally computer illiterate mother was introduced to Skype. All she needed to understand was that she could talk to all of her kids and grandkids for as long and as often as she liked without having to pay for long distance calling. She figured it out. (It wasn't easy)
If more vendors start passing on saved credit card fees to the customers that could help. I make an online purchase for $1000. I avoid 7% sales tax plus I get a 3-5% discount for using Bitcoin. This plus making Bitcoin way easier to acquire would go a long way.

There is a weird type of buttcoiner, that seems to have bought high with dreams of easy money, sold low when they realized their dreams were crashing, then became resentful of the whole thing. They took a risk and screwed themselves, so now they would rather watch the whole thing burn rather than admit they screwed up, not bitcoin.
