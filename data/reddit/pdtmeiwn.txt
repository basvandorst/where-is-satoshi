That's not what backing means.  You're pointing out why it has value.

It's a very good assumption that among people who know something is going to happen, they've already made their decisions about buying/selling.  In other words, it's already priced in.
I think the price is still going to skyrocket but the cause will be things that people don't "know" quite yet:
* Interest rates will be decreased by the Fed in 2016
* QE will eventually be restarted (once stock markets suffer)  
* People who aren't yet familiar with Bitcoin will familiarize themselves about it  
* Hard-to-debase assets like gold, silver, and Bitcoin will come back in vogue  
These are things that are not priced in yet.  
The price rise will be attributed to the halving, but in reality, will have nothing to do with it.  Lots of "I told you so's" will be dealt.

If the spirit of the tweet is, "You can't always distinguish clearly between settlement and payment, the lines are blurred, the two functions overlap" etc, then I agree.
But I vehemently disagree if the spirit is, "One day, Bitcoin should be able to handle every single trade that happens in the world."
When people make a distinction between settlement and payment, it's because they conclude that not every single trade in the world can be on the blockchain, nor should it be.  
On Wall Street, sometimes a single stock undergoes 5000 trades a second, and this number is only going to grow.  Surely not every single one of these trades can go on a blockchain.  I drink multiple cokes a day from vending machines.  I personally would not care if these exchanges were on the blockchain, and frankly, it seems like a waste of resources to announce to the world in an impeachable fashion that I bought these cokes.
So if not every single trade is going on the blockchain, then how might we envision the world working in the future?  How might high-frequency trading happen in the example above?  
An easy answer is that Wall St will have its own proprietary engine to allow 5000 trades/second, and at the end of the day, some summary or hash will be published to the blockchain.  In the words, the first part--the trades--will be on a centralized off-chain, and the second part--the summary--will be on a blockchain.  This makes sense because you're still getting the benefits of blockchain settlement (censorship resistance, unimpeachability, etc) without wasting resources on the minutiae.  
If we extend that framework into the rest of the world, then we can imagine a similar method for everyday transactions.  I won't care if my cokes (or coffees) are not on the blockchain.  Perhaps I open a lightning channel with my bank to do buy my cokes and coffees, and at the end of the month, we publish the summary on the blockchain.
Yes, the lines blur, the functions overlap, and it's not always clear what constitutes settlement vs payment, and no the blockchain can't tell the difference since a trade is a trade.  But Bitcoin's inherent high resource consumption (publishing every trade to every copy of the ledger, proof-of-work) makes it inevitable that some sort of division will occur between trades that you care deeply about and hence want decentralized and trades that are less important and don't need decentralized.  
And yes, we might not need to make such a distinction in the near future since the blockchain can, in theory, handle a lot more transactions in a decentralized way if only we raise the blocksize limit, but some day, we will.  It's inevitable.  Blockchains simply cannot handle every single transaction in the world.  That's not the point of blockchains, nor is it possible without centralizing them.
Disclaimer: I'm a tech doofus, and a lot of this is likely wrong.

When did I say eliminate the merchants?
I'm just saying they don't have much incentive to take Bitcoin and neither do customers have much incentive to use it.  


Every currency has to be a store of value first.  Gold was used as a store of value from about 4000 BC to 600 BC.  It only became a currency in 600 BC when it was minted into coins.  There's simply no way people can use something as currency if they don't value it as a store of value first. 
Why would I accept $10 as a merchant if I was not confident it would be worth the same a day from now or a month from now or a year from now?


You fundamentally misunderstand the problem.  Merchants convert to fiat because they're not comfortable with it being worth $1200 one day and $600 a few days later.  


And yet gold, which you can barely use at all as a medium of exchange, is worth $6 trillion.

@_date: 2015-12-12 19:53:16


I should modify my statement:  Bitcoin is an excellent long term store of value, but a shit short term store of value.  Long term holders care about years; merchants care about days to months and meeting payroll.


I agree.  It will be useful for many things in the future.  That's why I'm holding it today.  It does not follow that it has to be useful today to have value.


For most of gold's history, it was *useless*.  Industrial uses are basically a century old.  I think you underestimate how gold's essential uselessness gave it value as money.  That's right, good money has to be useless for nearly everything to be good money.
Imagine if we used oil as money (i.e, the dollars we use were redeemable for oil).  Price is fairly stable for a while.  New technology is created that is much cheaper than oil for energy needs.  Price of oil plummets, and therefore, our money gets instantly devalued.  Or OPEC issues a statement saying they're slowing production.  Price of oil rises, and therefore, prices drop instantly.  Money having a use makes it volatile.
Gold was historically great money precisely because it was useless.  That gave it a purely ledger function (in a decentralized way).  It was a Schelling point people could use as a reference for value.  It never got used up so that its stocks:flows ratio continually increased.  Etc.

Merchants will simply not accept Bitcoin itself (rather than cashing out into fiat immediately via Bitpay) until Bitcoin no longer has high volatility.  That can't happen with a market cap of $6 billion.  Right now, if I wanted to transfer $1 million of value across the Bitcoin network, I'd move the price at least $100 dollars if not more when I buy it with fiat and sell it on the other end.  That breeds price volatility.
On the other hand, if the market cap is $1 trillion, I could easily transfer $1 million dollar worth without moving the price.  Under those conditions, merchants will be *lining up* to accept Bitcoin because there will be no reason to cash out into fiat.  Similarly, under those conditions, remittance will be nearly free.
So the store-of-value function will dominate until we get a $1 trillion market cap.  Until that time, the western world does not need Bitcoin for any other reason.
@_date: 2015-12-11 20:45:51
When people want to store value, they are trying to protect themselves from their assets losing value.  They don't care if the assets gain value.  
The long term performance of Bitcoin since its inception is up in a big way.  It is indeed a good store of value.  This is why I have owned it since 2011 and will continue to own it for the next 5 years at least unless something fundamental changes.  I guarantee this is why other long term holders hold it.

I think you're absolutely right.  Essentially, miners will nearly always have an incentive to including every transaction with even a small fee as long as there's no blocksize limit.
So the relevant question for the blocksize limit shouldn't be, "What maximizes miner fees in the long run?" because I really doubt creating artificial scarcity of transactions does it.
Rather, it should be limited to, "What keeps Bitcoin decentralized in the long run?"

He subpoenaed information about commenters on a blog on posts about the Silk Road trial.  Given that the types of things those commenters said is found written every day all across the internet, the only conclusion is that Reason was specifically targeted, probably due to implicit support of the Silk Road site, or at least due to cracking down on commenters who support the Silk Road site.  Not only that, but Reason was given a gag order(!) about the subpoena.  I mean, holy fuck, these are thugs straight out of a dystopian novel.

Different parameters: less security, cheaper transactions, faster confirmation, etc.
Bitcoin at the moment has 350,000,000 Gh/second hash rate.  Do you really need this much to buy your coffee with?
If we kept blocks at a small size, transaction fees would rise, but you're really paying for security with those fees.  Perhaps periodically, you exchange some of those Bitcoins to a Sidecoin (in some decentralized manner) and those sidecoins have only 10,000 Gh/s hashrate, a 30 second confirmation time, and very low transaction fees, but it's good enough for buying coffee.
When you want to pay for a house, you use Bitcoin.

This is just nonsense.  Gold is a "settlement layer".  It is not visa level scaleable.  It has terrible confirmation times (days to weeks?).  Yet it's worth $7 trillion.
A scarce consensus asset can be, by itself, valuable.  Gold has proven that.  Bitcoin as purely a non-scaleable 10-min confirmation time asset can be valuable.  It already IS valuable.

Can someone explain how a miner could attack the network in the absence of a block size limit?  I understand it's something like this:
Miner creates a huge block with a ton of transactions.  Other miners and nodes have to verify the block.  This takes a lot of time.

If so, how can the miner profit from this?  Doesn't it cost money to actually find a block?  How does a miner decide how many transactions to include in a block?

Payment system = Bitcoin accrues a $100 billion dollar valuation.  If you buy Bitcoin and then sell it (i.e. use it to transfer value), it doesn't become more valuable.
Hoarding (i.e., store of value) = Bitcoin accrues a $5 trillion dollar valuation.  If you hoard, you buy but don't sell.
There are plenty of good payment systems, especially in the 1st world.  There will be plenty of good payment systems in the 3rd world with time.  There are no decentralized stores of value that can be transferred over the internet.  That is the fundamental value proposition of Bitcoin.

I agree with him that the Mad Max scenario some are predicting without a limit increase is a bunch of nonsense.  But I disagree with some other things:
1) Speculation.  People don't understand speculation and its role in finance, so I can't really ding him too hard.
2) 


With a lower blocksize limit, there are fewer transactions but higher fees.
With a higher blocksize limit, there are more transactions but lower fees.
Since miner fee revenue = fees x transactions, it's not immediately obvious which results in more revenues.  This is usually determined by "price elasticity of demand".  My guess is that total revenue is higher in a world without a blocksize limit.  If it made more sense for miners to limit transactions to increase total revenue, they'd do it themselves.  We shouldn't do it for them.
At the very least, Cohen's argument is not obviously true.

There's another huge problem with democracy: rational ignorance.
When I buy a car, if I make a good decision, I reap the benefits.  If I make a bad decision, I suffer the consequences.  The results of my decision are borne nearly entirely by me.  That incentivizes me to study up and make informed decisions.
In a democracy, if I make a good decision (vote), the benefits are mostly gained by others, only fractionally by me.  If I make a bad decision (vote), the costs are mostly borne by others, only fractionally by me.  In other words, the effect of my vote only infinitesimally affects me.  I have no incentive to make wise, informed decisions.  
In other words, in a democracy, voting is a costless action.  It's rational to be ignorant about good policy and bad policy.  Thus, you have people who are against free trade based on the idea that it's bad for the common man when it's been proven over and over again both in theory and in practice that it's good for the common man (and protectionism is bad for the common man).  And people who want to lock up others for smoking marijuana despite not knowing anything about marijuana.  Why do they hold these false beliefs and act (vote) on them?  Because it costs them nothing to be ignorant about the truth; it's rational for them to be ignorant.
As you said, there's one fairly good thing about democracy: when a tyrant is rising to power, he can be voted out.  But even that doesn't always work (see: Hitler).  If enough people want that guy, he'll win (Putin, Egypt's religious radicals, etc).  
I think people have a bias toward democracy because for the last 100 years, that's all we've known in the Western world.  On the whole, I think it's highly overrated.

Of course, but you never know if that pot of Bitcoin, which is much bigger today (in value) will be used for something even bigger in the future.
Regardless, the point remains that without saving you can't have investment.  As you said, picking the right investment matters.  
The level of saving vs the level of spending/investment is set by the market by something called the interest rate.  If rates were set freely by the market, people would know whether they're better off spending/investing or saving.  If rates are high, they're better off saving.  If they're low, they're better off spending/investing. The rates would adjust as the economy dictated.  They would serve as signal to people.

Thank you, thank you, thank you!  You're making my point for me.  Just because you create "regulation" it doesn't mean you get goodness.  People seem to think that regulation is synonymous with goodness and that if you create regulatory bodies/laws, you'll get goodness.  That implies that regulators are by and large honest, hard working, competent, and uncorruptable.  
Those of us who oppose regulation don't oppose goodness.  We want goodness.  We just think regulation generally creates badness.  "Regulation" (not goodness) creates a false sense of security.  It is generally a blunt tool that has large collateral damage.  Most damning though, is that regulators are people just like everyone else, and are prone to incompetence, greed, and corruption just like everyone else.  Regulatory capture is the norm.  The very institutions regulation is intended to regulate end up controlling the regulatory authority.
We don't need regulation; we need evolution.  Evolution of the ecosystem is the only way we'll actually get goodness.

Sure, anything that involves catastrophic events (like Mt. Gox going down) is insured by private players: car crashes, fire, floods, retail theft, etc.  Lloyds of London insures more unique, niche markets.  One of my childhood friend's parents' clothing store was robbed, and insurance restored the damages--something analogous to Mt. Gox.
You're probably thinking of something banking related. I admit, there are (essentially) no private players in the bank insurance market, but that's because the market is monopolized by a subsidized player, something private companies cannot compete with: the FDIC.  
The downside of the FDIC is:
1) People don't care what the bank is doing with their money because they believe they don't need to--the FDIC will bail them out.  The result is you get banks that do crazy, risky shit with massive leverage, and none of the people that loaned them the money (the customers) care.
2) When the shit truly hits the fan, the FDIC won't have the money to bail everyone out.
There are several Bitcoin startups looking to provide this type of insurance: Elliptic Vault, Falcon Global Capital, Xapo, Inscrypto.

Yes.  
Of course you might think the total amount of violence will be more, but I think it will be much less.  Why?  Because peace is more profitable than war.  Providers who engage in war will lose their customers.
Imagine if a customer in what is currently America got his monthly bill which showed a $5000 expense for "War with Yemen".  
He'd call up his provider---"Uh... What's this $5000 expense for War with Yemen?"
Customer Service Rep: "Yes sir, that's an action we engaged in to protect you."
Customer: "Protect me from what exactly?"
CSR: "Well, terrorists, of course."
Customer: "What terrorists?  Yemen?  You can't be serious!"
CSR: "Sir, we apologize for any misunderstanding, but we are protecting your freedom!"
Customer: :: click ::  
Customer proceeds to switch to a less violent provider.
Why does this not happen today?  
1) Elections happen every 4 years.  Democracy doesn't have the high-speed feedback markets do.
2) Because someone else is footing the bill, the people who decide to go to war are not selective about engaging in war.

There's a reason the rates go up as a percentage as countries get poorer.  It's not because "WU is evil"- that's simplistic and naive.  It's because the infrastructure is worse in poorer nations.
Just like this subreddit has figured out that it's hard to "close the loop" with Bitcoin remittance in most countries without paying a lot of fees, WU is essentially running a *whole* loop with fiat currencies.  The costs are high.  They're higher if there are issues with corrupt officials in the country in question, poor security, lack of infrastructure, rule of law, etc.  
Of course it costs more to send money to a poorer country.  That's what economics would predict.  
I'm a fan of Andreas, but I believe this is his leftist baggage coming through.  Western Union is not a charity.  They're a business.  Without them providing this service, the cost of remittance would be much higher.  They have not passed laws to prevent competitors from entering the market.  They have not been bailed out with taxpayer money.  It's time to stop saying they're evil simply for being in business.

I disagree with your idea that profit-based medical research will only lead to dick pills and hair restoration.
When I look at what types of things have lots of niche areas, it's almost always markets.  You can find a magazine for every hobby, interest, fetish, cause you can imagine.  You can find 25 different types of toothpaste.  A car of every size, color, function imaginable.  
When I look at what types of things are one-size-fits-all, it's almost always government-controlled areas: public schools, post office, taxicabs (licensing), etc.  
Markets make niche areas profitable because they are not winner-take-all.  Lots of people and companies can "win" because markets are positive-sum.  On the other hand, governments are majority-take-all and therefore, the most powerful control the funds.  There's much less room for niche markets.
So I'm much more optimistic about mesothelioma research being funded by for-profit companies than the NIH.  The company will go after that research because they know at least some people with mesothelioma are willing to pay for it.  With the NIH, they are much more likely to decide that dollars would be better allocated to things that affect more people like hypertension and diabetes.

Let me explain why despite what you say, I'm one of the "extremists" that don't support regulation.
1) What you describe sounds potentially great in theory.  But in the real world that exists, we don't get to pick and choose regulations.  We get to hire lobbyists who try to influence regulators who are appointed by politicians who are elected by the voting public.  Along the way, there are numerous entities who finance the politicians' campaigns, and this has a big effect on who the politician appoints as a regulator. 
In the real world, this process very rarely results in "good" regulation like you propose.  
We don't get to pick our regulations; we get to try to influence regulators.  In the real world, this result is nearly always a mish-mash of inconsistent, sometimes contradictory regulations that on the whole favor entrenched interests.  After all, they're the ones who have the politicians' ears.
2) Just remember that every single regulation you propose comes with a cost.  It's not just a complete positive. You have to look at the negatives too.  Requiring new companies to have regular audits, insurance, "standards" creates a barrier to entry.  You probably think that's worth it, that the result would be a *net* positive even if some companies wouldn't be able to survive because at least the surviving ones would have audits/insurance/standards.  
I, on the other hand, believe the picture of the *net* result is not that clear.  With every company that's weeded out by regulations, there are potential innovations that never happen.  I'd rather maximize potential innovations because a single innovation can spread to all companies instead of weeding out companies by raising barriers to entry.
3) In an ecosystem without the regulations you propose, consumers can still choose not to use the companies without those features.  I would not put my Bitcoins on an online wallet that did not have insurance on deposits, but perhaps someone else would if the cost was lower.

This is not correct.  It's only true over VERY long periods of time, like 50 years.  But on a shorter scale of 25-30 years, it's not.  For example, the return on stocks for someone who started in 1929 was zero for the next 25 years.  Similarly with someone starting in 1966 for the next 16 years.  And this is the US stock market.
Other stocks markets have an even worse variability.  The Nikkei is still at ~38% of its peak a full 25 years later.  The US economy today seems to be much like Japan's over the last two decades.  I wouldn't be surprised if the US stock market matches the performance of Japan's.

Governments are not magic.  They are made up of people, the same people as the rest of us.  Those people are good, bad, evil, generous, bigoted, open-minded, etc.  Even today, govts discriminate against minorities in significant ways.  In the US, for example, blacks are treated differently when it comes to marijuana-related crimes.  In other countries, Christians are oppressed.
Having a startup culture of govts allows people to experiment different ways of organizing people on a large scale.  Perhaps you and your friends can start your own govt somewhere announcing amnesty for any and all oppressed minorities.  
If I was a minority (and actually, I am, in many different ways), I'd want there to be lots of choices of govts in the world because I know at least some of them would be open to me.

Speculators are the most misunderstood group of people in financial markets.  They are the means by which the social utility of markets springs forth.  They are the truth-tellers of markets.
If it wasn't for speculators, the Bitcoin price would still be $5.  Hardly anyone outside of a few nerds would know about Bitcoin, there would be little venture capital investment, and most of the applications you see today would not exist.
Speculators see value in things others don't, and they bid up the price, thus announcing to the world, "Hey everyone, this Bitcoin stuff is the real deal!"  They are the instrument by which price discovery works.
And contra your statement: speculators *decrease* volatility by bringing liquidity to markets.

Totally agree.  Too many new people at once is a recipe for badness:
* They see Bitcoin as a get-rich-quick scheme, not for the loftier goals Satoshi and the cypherpunks had in mind.
* They don't know about security and end up losing large portions of their own wealth.
* After losing said wealth, they call out for regulation, as if regulation will protect them, and not destroy the ideals Bitcoin was founded on.
All of this leads to a terrible endgame: making Bitcoin a slightly better Paypal.  It makes it merely a transfer mechanism with slightly lower fees.
Well, geez, if that's what you want--and as I see it, it's not just newbies who want this, but rather, also key players in the Bitcoin space including some people in the Foundation and some core developers--why not just stick to Paypal?
Bitcoin's goals are loftier: a trustless system that can be anonymous or radically transparent based on the goals, decentralized, open source, bringing monetary security to the unbanked, creating a radical new way to manage assets, a predictable money supply, etc.
Slower adoption is more fruitful toward Bitcoin's original premise.

In my opinion, it's a bad currency because it's a good currency.  Let me explain:
Bitcoin will spend a few years to reach its "true" value.  At that point, it was demonstrate as much price stability as any other currency, probably more because of its predictable increase in supply.  But to get there, it will take a massive rise from a market cap of zero in 2009 to trillions in 2019 (just ballpark guesses).  Nothing goes up in a straight line.  So you get massive booms and busts along the way.  
In other words, it has (IMO), a great future as a currency, but to get there, it follows a highly volatile path making it a poor currency right now.
So yeah, it's a poor currency right now.  What most people miss is that it will likely be a great currency in the future.  You can't put a truly great thing out into the world without wild swings in the market value.

There was an invention made centuries ago to overcome this problem: receipts.  You couldn't split up your silver coin into small enough pieces to buy your morning coffee, but you could certainly represent that silver coin with 1,000 pieces of paper and use a few of those pieces to buy your coffee.  
That's not a problem of hoarding.  It's a problem of divisibility that was largely solved by paper.

Remember, when someone asks, "How can you trust Bitcoin if you don't even know who created it?" they are thinking in terms of the old world.  In the new world, trust no person, but rather, evaluate the code.  The proper reply is, "I don't need to know who created Bitcoin; I've evaluated the code and made up my own mind."
Apply this mindset to sidechains.

That's a good question.  Honestly, I don't know for sure so some of this might be wrong.  The reason is: I keep most of my coins in cold storage.  Therefore I do have my private keys on a piece of paper and will have to use it when I want to re-introduce my coins into a "hot" wallet.
AFAIK, for hot wallets, the software handles your public and private keys for you.  It keeps track of which private keys correspond to which public keys (addresses) and takes care of everything.
So your wallet is basically a bunch of public-key/private-key pairs.  In order to keep your wallet safe, you use a password.  As long as you're the only one with the password, nobody else can get to your private keys.
This is how I understand it; I hope others chime in if I'm wrong.
A couple of takeaways:
1) Make sure your wallet password is strong.  In other words, don't do something like "abc123".
2) Make sure you are using 2-factor authentication for online services like coinbase.  If you don't know what that is, let me know.
3) I don't trust myself to keep a hot wallet on my own computer.

If I see a picture of the Miami Heat players holding the NBA Championship trophy, I think to myself, "What a great accomplishment!  They had a tough road to the top.  And how about that Ray Allen--what a 3-point shot, one of the most clutch shots in NBA history!"
If instead, someone else sees the Miami Heat players holding the NBA Championship trophy and thinks, "As I've said before, pro basketball is full of black dudes", that indeed would be racist.  It's focusing on race instead of accomplishment, more on the color of their skin than the content of their character.

The Other Side of the Bitcoin
By Kevin Maney 
The stuff that makes people worry about bitcoin—its volatility, the notion that it's a nationless currency, the bizarreness of being able to "mine" money on a computer—are all part of a brilliant ploy designed to spread the crypto-currency around the world. And it's working.
Yes, we're being tricked into adopting bitcoin, but this is necessary so that it can eventually become so effortless it can be used by grandmothers, illiterate migrant workers and even Kardashians.
That's my takeaway after discussing bitcoin with three of the most influential players in the emerging sector: tech investor Marc Andreessen, Coinbase Chief Executive Officer Brian Armstrong and SecondMarket CEO Barry Silbert. All are certain bitcoin will transform global commerce. They're also pretty certain that even some brilliant people like Warren Buffett, who recently dissed bitcoin on TV, can't see beyond the short-term wackiness to the long-term importance.
As Andreessen explained to me, bitcoin is a foundation technology—an infrastructure to be built upon. In that sense, it is like the protocols that make the Internet possible, or the alternating current that travels over the electric grid.
However, it's rarely a good idea to just build an infrastructure and hope people will come. There's a chicken/egg problem. You couldn't build an electrical grid before anything was invented to take advantage of it. But nobody would invent electric gadgets if there were no grid. Thomas Edison needed to invent the lightbulb and the grid at about the same time.
The currency called bitcoin is the lightbulb; the technology of bitcoin is the grid. Both had to be created at the same time. And the really clever part of this story is how the bitcoin contingent is making millions of people want the lightbulb so the grid can get built.
Let's start with bitcoin as a volatile currency. Over the past year, bitcoin prices have seen more sky-high ups and steep crashes than a North Korean test missile. To some, that might indicate it is a passing fad. But to others—like speculators—the volatility is almost as alluring as bacon.
That's a key part of the ploy. "Bitcoin needed a bootstrapping mechanism," Armstrong told me. "The gold rush to get bitcoin was the bootstrap."
The very idea that the value of bitcoin was rising fast drew in people who were willing to take a chance by buying the currency even when there were few ways to use it. Few merchants at the outset accepted bitcoin, but those early buyers didn't need it to be useful—they got in because they thought bitcoin would be a windfall investment. That started the spread of it.
As more people bought bitcoin, the value rose, which in turn drew in more investors. At first, the only merchants taking bitcoin were either brave or running illegal enterprises, but as merchants came to believe their customers held bitcoin that they might want to spend, mainstream merchants started accepting it—especially since a bitcoin transaction costs them practically nothing. The credit card companies demand a fee of around 3 percent on every purchase.
As more people and merchants get with the program, the system becomes more attractive to yet more merchants and users. About 20,000 merchants accept bitcoin now. Coinbase—software that lets users easily buy and exchange bitcoin—is approaching 1 million consumer wallets. Those are relatively small numbers, but bitcoin adoption is picking up speed.
These days, bitcoin still looks more like a currency than an infrastructure to most people. It's something you buy, like gold or euros. Its value compared with other currencies will fluctuate. While that is good for drawing speculators, it creates a big handicap as bitcoin tries to spread to the general public.
The handicap: My mom doesn't want to think in bitcoin. For that matter, I don't want to think in bitcoin. I like my dollars just fine—I understand how much they are worth and what they can buy. Most people want a second currency about as much as an iPhone owner wants a second phone—running Windows.
But there's a way to fix that, and it's coming soon. Let's say I want to buy a $100 helmet on HockeyMonkey. The helmet is priced in dollars, which I understand. HockeyMonkey might say I can pay with a credit card, or I can pay with bitcoin and save 3 percent—the fee HockeyMonkey would have to fork over to Visa or Mastercard. If I buy in bitcoin, software like Coinbase could use my dollars to buy $100 in bitcoin just before the purchase, and instantly make the bitcoin transaction with HockeyMonkey. Essentially, I would never see a bitcoin or get exposed to its volatility. I would own bitcoin for a few seconds before it is sent to HockeyMonkey.
As that becomes the primary way bitcoin gets used, it's no longer a currency to most people. It's a payment system—a faster, cheaper, more global payment system than exists now. Andreessen believes it can disrupt credit cards.
To make that payment system work, bitcoin needs a robust market so dollars or euros or yen can constantly, instantly be exchanged for bitcoin in super-high volume. For a robust market to exist, bitcoin needs to be a "currency" that can be traded and speculated on. "You just can't bifurcate bitcoin currency from the technology," Silbert said. "Bitcoin will always need a monetary base."
So there's a big spiral at work. For bitcoin to get started, it needed to be a currency. For it to spread widely, it needs to appear to not be a currency. But to appear to not be a currency, it needs to be a currency.
And what about the whole mining thing? On the surface, it looks like geeks can set up industrial-strength computers in their mom's basement and create money just by calculating massive algorithms. The U.S. Treasury might as well let people counterfeit, right?
But mining is part of the grand bitcoin ploy. Bitcoin has no central computer system, no governing body, no mint. To track and verify every bitcoin holding and transaction takes tremendous computing resources. How to get that? Well, create a way for individuals to make money by doing bitcoin's computer processing.
That's what the miners are doing. They've been lured into building computers for bitcoin by the promise of being able to "make" some new bitcoins for themselves. Some succeed, some don't. Hard to say whether this is a brilliant motivating mechanism or a grand manipulation, but it has worked well.
The whole bitcoin scheme, in fact, seems to have worked very well, despite doubters and Buffetts. "Bitcoin is one of the most viral concepts I've ever encountered," Silbert said.
We've all been infected. And even this column is part of the contagion.

"Believe it or not but some people want regulation. Then there are people that don't. Regulated exchanges will come with additional costs with the bonus of peace of mind. It's a trade off though and the further you move away from regulation, the friction might be less but the risk is greater."
Let me restate what you said in a way that I agree:
"Believe it or not but some people want safety. Then there are people that don't. Safe exchanges will come with additional costs with the bonus of peace of mind. It's a trade off though and the further you move away from safety, the friction might be less but the risk is greater."
We both want safety.  The difference between you and me is that I don't think laws, i.e., "regulation" can provide that.  They may say their intention is safety, but only technological evolution can provide that.  
Heck, if tomorrow an exchange opened somewhere that provided cryptographic proof of reserve, but charged 5x in commissions compared to other exchanges, I'd use them in a heartbeat.  I don't see regulation providing that.

1) Additional units of the commodity/currency are not *arbitrarily* created but rather, follow a known function.  
2) There's no counter-party risk for wealth storage.  
3) Bitcoin has the potential to create "apps" that can't exist today within the highly regulated financial system--things like global black markets, prediction markets, and distributed autonomous organizations.

Yes, exactly.  OP only makes part of the argument.
The real argument against inflation is that as the price increases--including the price of labor (income)-- work their way through the economy, they don't work their way evenly.  Some prices go up before others.  
This process is heterogeneous.  Thus, there is a redistribution of wealth involved.  The people who know there is inflation happening and adjust their practices (buy hard assets, demand pay raises, etc) benefit at the expense of everyone else.  
So yes, along with higher prices for goods, we have today higher incomes, but along the way, many people got screwed.  Generally the people who get screwed are at the bottom of the economic ladder (because they have more to worry about than monitoring leading indicators of inflation) and the ones who benefit are the elite.

But that's not much of an answer. I'm a libertarian and I'm driven by the same things.  I want the world to be better, the poor to be taken care of, the sick to be attended to.  Most people have the same ends; the question is usually about the means.
My means are rules that allow voluntary relationships with minimal violence.  That results in free markets.  
What are Chomsky's means?  Will anarcho-syndicalists use force to try to equalize wealth if someone gets rich by voluntary means?
@_date: 2014-05-04 00:03:26
It's hard but the govt will work hard to find a way.  
One strategy might be for the govt to grant special privileges to certain corporations in the space in return for those corporations shaping the ecosystem in certain ways.  For example, the govt might say, "You can't run an exchange unless we give you a special license."
In order to get that license, you have to hire some bitcoin core developers as consultants.  To keep that license, those core developers have to push certain code--say whitelisting/blacklisting/redlisting addresses.  That would destroy the fungibility of bitcoin.
Or the govt could say you need a license to be a large scale miner.  But to get that license, you have to give 10% of all revenues to the govt.  Or agree to only run an inflationary version of the code.
And so on.
Now, I realize the USG is not the only govt in the world, but it's a powerful one.  Even today, when it comes to cooperation from other countries in catching financial "criminals", the USG gets what it wants.  
That said, I don't know if all of this would work, but it's certain something to be watchful for.

Consider for a moment the current justice system.  It's clearly in favor of the rich compared to the poor.  The ones with the most money make the rules.  Indeed, legislation is, for the most part, sold to the highest bidder.  
Sure, there are homilies made to equality under the law and basic human rights, but in the end, the most connected people win.
So we have a monopolistic legal system that's skewed in favor of the rich and connected.
My argument is that a polycentric legal system, i.e., a market for law would be less in favor of the rich and connected.  Why?  Because markets tend to bring down prices of scarce things.  Justice itself is one such scarce good.
Take the example of car insurance.  Make no mistake, when you cause harm to another person's car, it's a legal issue.  So this is not a completely unrelated issue.  A tort is in play.  Yet the market for car insurance is far more egalitarian than the legal system.  Just about everyone in the US can afford car insurance.   They can't always afford a good lawyer.  Sure, a public defense attorney will be assigned to everyone who needs one, but there's no reason why pro-bono attorneys can't be available in the system I envision.  And the cost of *any* attorney will be lower because markets bring down prices.
I agree with you that many people don't know what's in their long term self-interest.  But to make any system of human organization work, you just need *enough* people to buy in.

Those comments were within the larger context of a scathing criticism of Mt. Gox as an operation.  I don't know why he said BTC withdrawals were still working.  It's not clear to me when the interview was done, but sometimes the LTB episodes are published many days after they are recorded and it's not always clear when they were recorded.  Maybe at that time BTC withdrawals were still going on; maybe they weren't and he just misspoke.
Regardless, if the price of Mt. Gox (or any exchange) diverges to a large degree from the others, you have to assume some probability of insolvency.  The price was telling everyone that there was a high likelihood of insolvency.  Why would you gamble like that where there were perfectly good exchanges available?
It's clear from the interview that Andreas didn't have any inside information regarding Mt Gox.  He was giving his opinion based on the fact that Gox had generally been on the up-and-up during its history and that its major flaw was managerial incompetence, not malevolence.
I like Andreas; I think he's a great spokesperson and advocate for Bitcoin.  But some people expect some kind of god-like being to guide them.  He ain't that, and ain't nobody that.

Before anyone accuses me of being a heartless a-hole, I've lost far more BTCs than any story I've read so far in the Mt Gox debacle as a result of another Bitcoin enterprise having its own issues.  It's a life-changing amount of coin.  My initial reaction was to blame the person in charge of the enterprise.  He was clearly at fault, but I eventually came to see how foolish I was in not putting my coins in cold storage.  I learned how afterward and now I'm a lot smarter not just about Bitcoin security, but computer security in general.

Yes, I agree that the term "voluntary" is not quite clear-cut for the reasons you describe.  The line between voluntary and exploitive can get blurry.
However, I totally disagree with the "minimal violence" part.  Most libertarians use the "you started it" rule wrt violence.  Whoever starts it is the violent aggressor.  If I'm walking down the street and you try to take my wallet, I may have to fight you off.  I shouldn't be blamed for fighting you off because you started the fighting first.  So existing property rights are *defended* by force, but those violating them are the ones in the wrong.  
Now, the usual argument against what I just said is that the existing property rights are problematic due to historical reasons.  But that's just arguing in circles.  We have to start somewhere.  If you want to rearrange the current property distribution, you need someone with a big stick to take from some and give to others.  That's a recipe for disaster.
As far as Shrem, he was helping people take part in voluntary interactions.  The state decided this was illegal.  They threw him in jail.  They are *violating* property rights, not enforcing them.

Don't agree.
He says, "A decentralized financial system is better, cheaper and faster - and it is these attributes that will serve as the foundation for historic change."
This is incorrect.  I don't blame him, though, since most people on this subreddit think the same.
Centralized systems are cheaper and faster than decentralized systems.  An E-gold system that was hypothetically allowed to exist would be million times cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is only faster and cheaper than the current obsolete centralized system, not faster than a modern centralized system.
The chief value proposition of Bitcoin is that it's decentralized.  The system expends a lot of resources to keep it that way.  Decentralization comes at a steep price.  Of course, I think it's well worth it.  But let's not kid ourselves: centralized systems are cheaper and faster.

Any free society is going to have inequality.  The early investors of Apple got a lot more wealth than the later investors or people who didn't invest.  Any investment with large network effects like many technologies is going to have inequality.
Having said that, Bitcoin does make the poor better off.  They are the ones most effected by inflationary policies because they're the ones who can't least afford inflation and they're the ones least likely to anticipate inflation and buy a hedge like gold.  It allows them to save easily and have their savings grow year after year due to its deflationary nature.  It also helps them by being transparent and decentralized so that political cronies aren't able to exert so much influence over the monetary authority.
This is in addition to the most obvious way Bitcoin helps the poor: remittances.

To play Devil's Advocate:
Many people think that if you advocate for states' rights (in the US), you must be a racist.  This is because at one time, people who advocated states' rights were racists.  But today, I advocate states' rights as a check on Federal power and as a way to create numerous laboratories for experiments in policy.  Yet I'm branded a racist by some people whenever I argue that states should be allowed to set their own laws for most things.  The term "states rights" carries a lot of baggage.
Similarly, calling it a "Freemarket" would potentially load a lot of baggage into that term if the majority of business conducted on it was for illegal drugs.  The next time somebody advocated for free markets, the response might be, "You just love drugs, don't you?"

Sure.  The sidekick kept referring to a Bitcoin "IP address".  
There are no IP addresses in Bitcoin.  There are simply "public keys" and "private keys".  The public key is something that you can publicize.  It's what people use as the destination when they send Bitcoins to you.  
One good analogy is to email.  Everyone has an email address; it's public.  Just because someone knows your email address doesn't mean they have access to your emails.  That's very much like the Bitcoin public key.
In order to actually read your emails and send out emails to others, you need a password.  This is analogous to your Bitcoin "private key".  You use it to access your Bitcoins and send them to others.  
So the sidekick was probably referring to a Bitcoin public key.  He was worried about publicizing it, but shouldn't be since it's simply your public-facing string of numbers that allow others to send you bitcoins.  What he (and everyone) shouldn't publicize is the private key.  
Regarding the other issue: when you send fiat to an exchange like Bitstamp (and Mt. Gox) and buy some Bitcoins, you don't actually have true control of the Bitcoins unless you have Bitstamp send you the coins to your public key.  Otherwise, it's simply a note in their internal accounting system allocating them to your name.  
Suppose you buy some bitcoins on an exchange like Bitstamp, and then sell them again.  Now in your account, you have fiat allocated to your name.  That transaction that happened in which you bought and sold bitcoins is NOT reflected in the global bitcoin ledger aka the Blockchain.  Rather, it's an "off-chain transaction."
Ohanian is correct in that all Bitcoin transactions are public on the Blockchain, but anything that happens on an exchange is actually not a Bitcoin transaction; it's an off-chain transaction that happens inside the black box of "Bitstamp" or "Mt Gox".  This means you have to trust Bitstamp to not screw you over.  Which is kind of anti-spirit-of-Bitcoin since Bitcoin was invented to not need to trust third parties.
Anyway, hope that helps somewhat.

To a certain extent, any free market will probably have a power law distribution.  Creating a Facebook will (and should) create billionaires.  However, contra Piketty, the people at the top will change over time as capital simply does not breed more capital.  Innovation and disruption make sure of that.  
However, in the crony capitalist system we have currently, the people at the top get to stay at the top by passing laws which restrict competition, funding the election campaigns of politicians that will bail them out, and creating "regulations" which are just barriers to entry in disguise.
To the extent that Bitcoin brings us to a freer market, it promotes less inequality and a more fair world.

I'm a libertarian because:
* I don't believe in violence as a means to do anything other than as a last resort to oppose other violence.
* I believe institutions that exist in a competitive environment are much better behaved than those that do not.
* Related: I'm generally against monopolies.

Good answer!  I'll leave with just a few thoughts:
-- As you sort of implied, everyone has a profit motive.  Businesses do.  Politicians do.  Regulators do.  Bitcoiners do.  Peercoiners do.  Regulators may not have an accounting statement showing "profit", but they like working 9-5, having their meals bought by lobbyists, going to conferences in Hawaii, etc.  There's much profit in that.
-- As a libertarian, I do not believe that the govt has the potential to be good in theory but sucks in its current state.  I believe corruption is fundamental to its nature.  Note this isn't a statement about morality ("Govt is immoral") but rather it's a statement about what is true ("Govt systematically is corrupt").  I do not believe you can "fix" governments any more than you can fix a shark's propensity to eat the little fish.  There's a field of economics that has studied the incentives associated with govts called the public choice school and its conclusions jibe with mine.  
-- To me, the best fix for market failure isn't a political market.  Rather, it's other entrepreneurs coming up with solutions a la peercoin.

This is true of *some* Wall Street firms, namely arbitrageurs, trading firms, and HFTs.  It's not true of value investors, speculators, long/short funds, global macro, etc.  In other words, it's not true for at least 50% of Wall Street.

Speculators are one of the most misunderstood class of people in financial markets.  Specifically with Bitcoin, if there were no speculators, there would be magnitudes fewer people involved in the space, less development, no infrastructure.  It would be the purview of bunch of hobbyist nerds in a small corner of the internet if not for speculators.

Not sure why you're getting upset.  I'm merely stating my opinion.  People are allowed to have differing opinions.
I completely disagree with you.  When the US imposes economic sanctions on a country, the people suffer.  I realize the intention is to make the ruling govt suffer.  But that's not the end result.  The actual result is that the govt tightens its grip on the people.  When the US imposed economic sanctions on Iraq, Saddam didn't suffer; he still had palaces full of gold.  Ordinary Iraqis starved.  Of course, they starved for other reasons, namely that Saddam was depriving them of basic human rights.  But acknowledging that does not deny the fact that the sanctions deprived the country of resources, and in turn, Saddam protected his wealth in every way possible, that included depriving his citizens of resources.
Same with US economic sanctions on Cuba.  The goal since the 1960s was regime change.  Yet all the sanctions did was to further impoverish the population with no change in regime.  
The best way to empower people is to make them richer.  Sanctions do the opposite.  It's through relatively free-ish trade with China, along with China's own liberalization reforms that the standard of living of the average Chinese has risen enough that the Chinese have found out about the rest of the world and are demanding political rights.  An trade-isolated China would've merely kept the Chinese people ignorant of the possibilities of life.

CEOs are generally the most skilled people in any company.  They not only have to know about the product and how it fits the market, but also know how to manage people, grow an organization, market to outsiders, innovate, etc.  Very few people in any company have this skillset.

Most prior money did NOT have a govt enforcing its use.
Further, central banks historically have NOT restricted supply to control inflation.  Rather, they have a very hard time restricting the additional of more monetary units to the point where inflation is a constant.
The most natural form of money in history is gold in a free market.  Bitcoin is the closest analogue in digital form.

It does.  But in the meantime, if getting into the Bitcoin ecosystem is too hard for people, WU could offer a cheaper service than they do now but using Bitcoin as the backbone of their system, as opposed to the legacy banking system.
Granted, they'd still have to use the legacy system around the periphery, so the transfers wouldn't be as cheap as some using Bitcoin alone.

Very common argument among the naive: "I welcome regulation.  I only want fair, sensible regulation."
What they, like Selkis, miss is that regulators have neither the knowledge or incentive to make fair, sensible regulation.  Knowledge is something that's discovered at the local level by trial-and-error, tinkering, etc, not in a bureaucrat's office.  And the incentive for regulators is whatever will further their careers the most; generally it's listening to establishment players who fund the election campaigns that get them elected or get their bosses elected.
And then, these naive useful idiots are shocked--*shocked*--at what kind of regulation actually materializes.
Stop being so naive, Selkis.

This is Jim Rickards, a big guy in the goldbug world (though not an Austrian).  He’s been railing against Bitcoin from the start.  He used to tell people that the people who designed Bitcoin might have been great programmers but they didn’t understand economics.  If you can stomach it, watch his debate with Micky Malka here where he shows his cluelessness.
Since then he’s now pretending he’s quasi-neutral toward it, but he still won’t admit that he was ever against it.  I really wish the Nakamoto Institute guys would add him to their skeptics page, with quotes selected from the above debate with Malka.

Bitcoin is cheaper than *current* centralized payment options.  That's because the current options use old tech and the legacy system.
Bitcoin is not cheaper than a hypothetical centralized currency that would use *modern* technology.  So far, every single one of these (e-gold, liberty dollar, etc) has been shut down under one guise or another.
However, with Bitcoin as the precedent of "digital money", the government might allow a centralized currency in the future, especially if said currency inventors greased the right palms.  That currency would probably be a million times faster/cheaper than Bitcoin.
Remember, Bitcoin spends a lot of money/energy to keep things decentralized.
This is something 95% of Bitcoiners don't get: the only real true breakthrough of Bitcoin is decentralization.  Everything else can be achieved more cheaply and faster with centralization.

Who is the target of a remittance?  
Is it the person living without a computer, running water, etc?  No.  Those people are also probably not the ones receiving remittances via Western Union either.  They have bigger problems.
The person on the receiving end is probably a bit higher on the socio-economic ladder.  He already receives remittances, likely via an informal network, ie., Hawala.  In other words, someone in his country receives funds legally from overseas via various above-board means, then transfers it to the appropriate people on the black market.
There's no reason why Bitcoin can't be used in this manner.  Most likely, there will be some way to convert Bitcoin to local cash legally, but that cash will only trickle its way down to the intended recipient via Hawala.
This is where I think Ripple could greatly enhance Bitcoin: Ripple, in its ideal form, is electronic Hawala.

But we as citizens can't simply pick good regulation and leave out bad regulation.  What we pick are elected representatives who appoint regulators.  In other words, regulation is an outcome of the political process.  
If you study the process economically, you get the field of public-choice economics.  It's a fairly new field which didn't exist 40 years ago.  The outcome of the study is consistent:  the process *inherently* results in bad regulation much more frequently than good regulation.
The reason is that the democratic process creates bad incentives for special interests.  To get elected, politicians need money for campaigns.  Who has the most incentive and money to sponsor specific politicians?  Special interests.  This is the "concentrated-benefits diffuse-costs" dynamic of the political process.
There's an underlying quid-pro-quo involved.  Of course politicians are going to appoint regulators that benefit the people who funded their campaigns.  In the end regulators become the tool of the regulated, i.e., "regulatory capture".  
So yes, in theory, there are good regulations and bad regulations.  But in practice, the bad regulations inevitably crowd out the good regulations.
In contrast, I prefer market-based regulations which are more likely to be good, not bad.  What's the result of Mt Gox?  A lot of people are going to learn about cold storage.  There's already a call for cryptographic proof-of-reserve for exchanges.  I'm 100% sure that within a year, we will have exchanges in the space that are provably full-reserve.  Moreover, centralized exchanges will eventually give way to decentralized exchanges.  All of the these changes are good regulations that come about because customers demand them, not because a regulator appointed by a politician creates them.  Customers have greater incentives to demand good regulations  instead of bad ones.  Regulators have greater incentives to impose bad regulations instead of good ones.
@_date: 2014-05-07 02:16:36
The free market solution is private insurance.  The insurance company has an incentive to make sure they audit the exchange and inspect their practices (cold storage, use of private keys, etc).  It's also trial and error--you need to do experiments to figure out the best practices.  And yes, that means that some firms will fail.
The alternative is regulators.  The problem is:
1) Regulators have zero incentive to do a good job.  If they fail, it doesn't affect their bottom line.
2) Regulation hurts the little guy because it only allows those that can afford large compliance departments to exist.
3) It also stifles the trial-and-error aspect of figuring out the best solution.  Instead you get a one-size-fits-all solution that may be overkill or may be underkill.
4) Most of all, it hinders competition because eventually the big players capture the regulators.  The only way regulators can profit from the system is by selling policy to the highest bidder.
In the end, regulation is simply security theater no different from the TSA at the airport.  They wave their wands and grope and scan, but none of it makes a whiff of difference in terms of real security.
What's *undeniable* is that current money licensing regulations created an environment in which there were zero US exchange Bitcoiners could turn to.

I agree- centralization creates efficiencies.  My only problem is that a bunch of newbies came to Bitcoin after the April 2013 bubble and bought in and proceeded to store their coins at Mt. Gox.  They trusted a 3rd party--which they have every right to, as you point out--but then they blamed Bitcoin itself, and many of them begged for regulation which IMO harms Bitcoin and I fear would turn into into a slightly better Paypal.
They do have that choice, but I also will shout loudly from the rooftops that trusting 3rd parties that are uninsured with your private keys is risky.  I hope you can see that I'm not forcing anyone to do anything.

The only reason Bitcoin is anti-fragile is because it's a free market, and free markets are anti-fragile.
Existing financial markets are highly regulated and are therefore fragile.  With regulation comes conformity of practices, moral hazard, and socialization of risk.  That's how you get Lehman--one firm goes down and the whole system is at risk.
Bitcoin will soon be regulated good and hard unfortunately, and it will become similarly fragile.

That's a difficult question to answer.  I'm not sure I have a great answer.
One of the fundamental tenets of my philosophy is: Utopia is not an option.  Our choices are usually about a set of imperfect outcomes and finding the least imperfect outcome.
On the one hand, we have a situation in the market in which a monopoly arose.  That's a less-than-ideal situation.
On the other hand, we have the govt trying to empower itself to break it up.  This leads to a lot of other bad outcomes: lobbyists, regulatory capture, etc.  This is an even worse situation, IMO.
I prefer the first imperfect situation compared to the second.  
I admit both of these are imperfect.  What most people do is idealize the second situation as "The govt shall solve this problem."  They ignore all the things that come with the govt, a monopoly itself, wielding its power.
That answer may not satisfy most people.  In fact, it probably won't.  Oh well.
The other part of the equation is: wait it out.  Markets are evolutionary, dynamic processes.  Especially free markets.  A monopolistic company at time X will be hard-pressed to maintain its position for long.  Every heavyweight eventually falls on its face-- IBM, Con Edison, Woolworths, etc.

Yes, you can't move your house, but you can move your cops.
To draw an analogy, it used to be that where you lived determined your religion.  If you lived in certain parts of Europe in the middle Ages, you had to be Catholic.  If you weren't, they'd basically kill you.  That was true until the Reformation.  And then, you had to be a Protestant or they'd kill you.  Luckily, today, you can be any religion living anywhere in Europe (most parts).
Similarly, I can have one car insurance company while my neighbor has another.  If he and I get into a car accident with each other, we each tell our side of the story to our insurance companies and they duke it out.  They have an incentive not to fight long drawn-out legal battles in court, and they have methods of low-cost dispute resolution.  My neighbor and I don't need to have the same car insurance company.
I'm making the claim that your neighbor and you don't need to have the same cops.  Of course, the vital question is, "If you have different cops, why won't those cops fight each other?"  That is a good question.  It's an interesting question that some very smart people have put a lot of thought into.  I won't rehash the answer, but it basically boils down to "Peace is more profitable than violence."

Hi Fred,
I watched the talk and like your humility.
I have a couple of different views from you which might be worth thinking about:
Your argument seemed to be that more exchange-use of Bitcoin, i.e., greater velocity, could stabilize the price.  I think the cause-and-effect is reversed: price stability will lead to greater velocity.  To get there, greater speculation will lead to a much higher “market cap” which is necessary to build enough liquidity for velocity to increase.
Right now, even a lowly hobbyist like me could drop the Bitstamp exchange price 5% if I sold all my coins.  The market cap needs to be much, much higher.  Heck, I shouldn’t be able to move the price even 0.1%.  To get to that point, the price needs to be 50-100x higher.  Current holders like me know this to be true, so we keep holding.  Once the price achieves that, I’ll probably sell a large % of my coins.  The price will be very difficult to move at that point.  And people will be much more likely to use Bitcoin as a medium-of-exchange.  
In other words, to have higher velocity, price stability is needed.  To get price stability, you need liquidity.  To get liquidity, you need speculation.  That’s the path.  
I don’t worry about “hoarders” right now because in this phase of Bitcoin’s history, they’re vital to support the price.  I don’t worry about speculators because they’re needed to take the price higher.  Only then will there be enough liquidity to yield price stability and generate velocity.
Separate point:
Start with the entire market cap of Bitcoin: # of coins x price.
Adding more coins by protocol does nothing to increase the market cap.  The price will simply drop in response.  In other words, the value of the Bitcoin ecosystem doesn't change, the same way that Dogecoin's billions of coins does not make it a more valuable ecosystem than Bitcoin's. 
All adding more coins does is redistribute money to the people who have first access to it: miners.
This is why counterfeiting is immoral: the people with the new money get to spend it before its effects have percolated through the economy.  
Raising the number of Bitcoins is not a good idea.  
@_date: 2014-10-30 04:30:08
And yet, look at the Silicon Valley ecosystem.  Companies go from apartments to hi-rises.  Nothing of the sort goes on at Wall Street.  The reason is the low barriers to entry in SV promote failure, embrace it, encourage it.  "Move fast and break things" is the Facebook motto.  All of this failure creates an ecosystem that evolves quickly and allows the best companies to rise to the top.
Wall Street tries to manage failure by central planning, regulation, etc, and what they get is giant blowups and too-big-to-fail (LTCM, Dot-com, 2008, etc).  Trying to apply the Wall Street outlook to the Bitcoin ecosystem is a recipe for more of the same.

I know the miners don't have incentives to destroy Bitcoin, but govts do.  They can do this in two ways:
1) Buy up a ton of ASIC hardware.  This would be noticed and the price of ASICs would shoot through the roof and the Bitcoin ecosystem would take steps to mitigate this.  I don't worry much about this scenario.
2) Lean on the top 3 pool operators and tell them to do what they say or they'll go to jail or kill their families, etc.  Then we have a big problem.  That's what I worry about.  
Centralization of miners is a worry not because of miners' incentives or because of govt buying up hardware to carry out a 51% attack, but rather, it creates a very small # of points of failure through which the govt can "influence" Bitcoin.

With each new bubble, the Bitcoin community gets a massive influx of new users who just want to have the price go up and have no idea about the ideals behind Bitcoin.  They insist that Bitcoin has no political agenda, that Satoshi had no political agenda.  They insist that regulation is necessary for mainstream acceptance (despite the fact that Bitcoin has done just fine in its first 5 years).  They start to call anyone who wants to keep Bitcoin's decentralized roots a "libertard".
Then reality smacks them in face when the friendly man from the body that's supposed to protect consumers proposes rules that favor the establishment and weed out upstarts.  They're shocked, *shocked*, that such a thing could happen.  They insist that the man in the suit will see the feedback, sleep on it, and change his mind.
To these people, I say: let this be a life lesson.  Aside from protecting property rights, the govt is not a positive force.  "Regulation" is a nice-sounding doctrine; "consumer protection" has the air of benevolence.  But make no mistake, the actual result, in real life, in practice not theory, is crony capitalism.
The whole point of Bitcoin is having to trust as few people as possible.  If there are shortcomings in the ecosystem, the solution is to improve the technology and software, not to get the fossils of NY involved.  
The whole point of Bitcoin is to create an alternative financial system.

That's not Bitcoin's competitive advantage.  Bitcoin is actually super-inefficient to a theoretical centralized digital currency.  It has to be super-inefficient in order to be decentralized.  Bitcoin's key differentiation is that it's decentralized.
A centralized digital currency would be a million times cheaper and efficient than Bitcoin.  So far, the govt has shut all of these down with the excuse of money laundering, tax evasion, etc.  But that doesn't mean it won't allow a centralized digital currency in the future.

Yes, it is the point of market-based regulations to allow people to "vote with their dollars".  And you're right, they are often blinded by flashy marketing rather than substance.
On the other hand, political regulation is in the end a product of elections because politicians appoint regulators.  People are also blinded in elections by flashy marketing rather than substance.  See: any campaign ad.
In fact, public choice economics shows that people are much worse at making decisions in elections than they are at making decisions in markets because of something called "rational ignorance".
If I'm buying a car, I have to do my research.  What motivates me to do my research?  Well, if I make a bad decision, the negative consequences of making a bad decision fall on me.  I'll be the one stuck with the lemon, not anyone else.  But if I make a good decision, I'll be the one who benefits from a reliable/smooth driving/feature-filled car, nobody else.  The consequences of good decision making pretty much all fall on me--not on my neighbor, not on the guy in the next town or next state.
Contrast this to politics:  my vote, by itself, has little effect on the outcome.  So if I make a bad decision in voting, the consequences of that vote, however small the effect, is borne by everyone.  Similarly if I make a good decision, the consequences are borne by everyone, not just me.  In other words, it costs me nothing to make a bad voting decision whereas the benefits of my good voting are spread to everyone.  Thus, it's rational for me to be ignorant about my decision, i.e., rational ignorance.
So people are much more likely to be "vote" for good regulations in a market than they are to vote for politicians who will appoint regulators who make good regulations in the political process.

See, I do think it's a very complex issue.  The future is going to depend on proof-of-reserve via cryptography, best practices regarding preventing theft from within the firm, geographically dispersed cold storage to minimize theft risk, etc.  This is going to take a lot of trial and error, adaptation, etc.  
That's already happening.  Consumers want it; exchanges are doing it, or are in the process of doing it.  Exchanges today look a lot different from exchanges two years ago.  Most of them have 2FA implemented, for example.  
Heck, look at Coinbase.  They pretty much require 2FA to work.  Their system of cold storage is intricate also: they have private keys in safe deposit boxes scattered all over the world.  Why would they do this, without prompting from a regulator?  Because they want consumers to use their service.  
What I fear from licensing is that the future Coinbases are shut down because of either lack of money to get licenses or lack of connections.  Further, licensing will set a fixed-standard of practices to follow, not an evolving standard that comes from trial-and-error.  Imagine if before Coinbases was found, the California regulators would have said, "You have to pay $1 million for an application for license and you have to have 2 FA authentication."  
Coinbase may or may not have had the money (though with Andresen Horowitz backing, they probably would), they may not have had the connections with the regulators, or *most importantly*, they may have gotten the license and thought, "We don't need to scatter the private keys all over the world because a) it costs money and b) we don't think too many other companies will be able to obtain a license"
Regulation prevents evolution.  The most important part of the market is evolution within the ecosystem.  Regulation "freezes" the evolution into a single point in time, keeps out new entrants, and results in an adynamic ecosystem.

Yeah, but IMO they are wrong.  You could do all that with a centralized currency, and it would have much lower fees.  Bitcoin is efficient and low cost compared to the legacy system of banks, wires, ACH, etc, but it is highly inefficient compared to a centralized purely electronic currency.  Various centralized electronic currencies have existed like Linden dollars, WoW gold, e-gold, digicash, etc.  Nobody wanted them.
The defining feature of Bitcoin is decentralization, and it's the real reason it has succeeded thus far.

In a way, yes, but in a way, no.
Let's take an absurd, though (unfortunately) real example: the licensing of hairdressers.  Yes, that is a thing.
I have my own property: my person, my hair, my money.  The hairdresser has his own property: his person, his tools, his place of work.
With enforcement of property rights, I trade my property (money) for his services (hair dressing) that he delivers with his property.  So far, so good.
If he defrauds me, i.e., takes my credit card number and rings up a ton of charges, my property (money in my bank account) has been violated.  I'm totally fine with the govt going to bat for me to "make me whole".
However, a license is going too far.  Why?  Suppose the guy I want to do my hair doesn't have a license.  I still want my hair done by him.  Yet if the two of us partake in this transaction, he (and/or I) will get fined.  If we don't pay the fine, we'll go to jail.  That's is a VIOLATION of property rights.
Now make no mistake, the people who do the licensing will claim to be protecting me, but I'm not free not to use their protection.  The purely voluntary transaction I wish to make with the hairdresser is made illegal.
Generally, the people who push for licensing are established entities in the space who want to keep the competition out.  If they impose enough red tape, need for schooling, capital, etc, few people will be able to enter the field.
I took hairdressing as an outlier example to make the point more easily. However, I'm just as comfortable saying I don't want anyone licensed in any field.  Licensing is a fundamentally anti-competitive measure that rips off consumers under the guise of protecting them.
You can still get your "stamp of approval" that this guy is good at what he does, has gone to school, etc in many other ways: certification, reviews, etc.

Bitcoin was not made purely as a way to redistribute money.
Rather, its humanitarianism lies in the fact that it's an uncorruptable system.  The poor of the world have been on the receiving end of bail-ins, out-of-control inflation, capital controls, regulation, and unenforced property rights for thousands of years.  Bitcoin is the exact opposite.  That's how it's humanitarian.

Democracy is definitely the problem.  Too much democracy = mob rule.  The original design of America had built in checks on democracy: Bill of Rights, elected representatives, checks and balances, powerful judicial branch, and the most important of all: a federal system of largely independent states that prevented the central govt from having too much power.
Since that time, the central govt has accrued more and more power, totally overwhelming the states and even growing beyond its own boundaries into the world's policeman.  Its tentacles know no bounds.

I don't think this is the reason.  
The reason that banks exist is that it was impossible for one person to secure a large amount of money by himself, whether it be gold, paper money, or seashells.  A bank was a "hold-your-nose" least worst option for safekeeping wealth.  If you didn't want a thief stealing your wealth, you had to store it in a bank.
Of course, the problem with this idea is that the banks themselves could steal your wealth.  And this was the history of banking for hundreds of years: secure storage for long stretches punctuated by bank runs and insolvency.
With Bitcoin, you can literally store a billion dollars worth of BTC on your own.  There may be various holes in the process now, but in the future, with multi-sig, hardware wallets, etc, it will be easier.

That's cool.  I do hope other parts of the political spectrum embrace Bitcoin.
I think it is important to make sure you know the effects of various policies you support.  It seems to me that you consider yourself a liberal because you want the world to be a better place, and specifically, you want the less fortunate to be better off.
Would it surprise you to learn that I'm a libertarian for the same reasons?  I want the world to be a better place, and I want to maximize human flourishing, and that includes especially those that don't have the opportunities to do so today.
I see the progressive tax system as the food supply of the beast that promotes cronyism: a system in which a few benefit via political privilege at the expense of the many.  This includes various corporations, unions, special interests groups, etc.
A single payer healthcare system would limit choice and massively hinder innovation.  What we need instead is to stop subsidizing employer-based health coverage.  Insurance should be for catastrophes only--that's how it works in all other realms (fire, flood, etc).  All other costs should be borne by the consumer.  Yes, I'm sure this sounds like it would be expensive to a lefty, but it's the only way to bring costs down.  The price of non-insured medical procedures like Lasik and plastic surgery have dropped fast while the insured system continues to get more expensive.
A true single-payer healthcare system would be the VA for the rest of us.  That's not the way to help people.
Similarly, public education spends $10000 a year with poor results.  Poor people should have the choice of what school they want to attend.  That's the only way to breed innovation.
Anyway...I could go on... and I know you said you didn't want statists to have to defend their beliefs in this thread, but I just wanted to point out that libertarians can have the same ends as leftists, but disagree on the means.

Gavin is a "milquetoast" libertarian.  He's generally skeptical about govt power, but in the end, he believes in a final monopoly arbiter of justice.  He wants the govt to be involved in consumer protection (said as much to the Council of Foreign Relations).  He believes that despite all of its flaws, the govt has a few good people in it that are going to be honest, capable, and wise.
This is antithetical to Satoshi's ideals--"Then strong encryption became available to the masses, and trust was no longer required. Data could be secured in a way that was physically impossible for others to access, **no matter for what reason, no matter how good the excuse, no matter what.**"
People like Gavin and Mike see Satoshi's statement as too black-and-white, that sometimes there are good reasons and excuses for the govt to become a trusted third party, that such a loophole should be a part of Bitcoin.
The Gavin's and Mike's always rise to the top of organizations like the Bitcoin Foundation, not the Satoshi's of the world.  They see the need for a final arbiter with powers the rest of us don't have, and my theory is that they subconsciously picture themselves as those final arbiters.

I hope you don't believe that libertarians = Ayn Rand.  A lot of libertarians are indeed influenced by her.  But libertarianism has a richer scholarship than just her.  I am one of these libertarian anarchists who is instead influenced by Hayek, David D. Friedman, and the public choice school.
I certainly don't "live in a permanent state of resentment."  Rather, I see libertarianism as the highest expression of peace.  I support it because I believe it is the best way to create a peaceful, prosperous, happy society in which people are best able to pursue their own conception of the good life.  I see it as the most effective way to uplift the poor.
The opposite--governments--are by definition backed by violence.  Violence is a corrupting force that gets bought by the highest bidder and by the most organized groups at the expense of the poor and the loosely organized.  The result is a completely irrational means of creating rules which results in war, inflation, special privilege for political cronies, and impedes innovation.
I hope you look more into the non-Rand aspect of libertarianism.  There's a whole 'nother world out there.

What you say is true in theory, but it has several problems:

*  Even if it could, state agents have no incentive to bring these inventions to fruit.
*  As the poster upthread stated, the state has no skin in the game.  Why would they do a good job?  Why would they seek the lowest prices?  Why would they not shift risk to the taxpayer?

Anyone can create an electronic currency.  Facebook could do it.  What's App could do it.  They could release tokens to their users and keep a ledger of what tokens are owned by which user--debit from the sender, credit to the receiver.  They could set up physical locations in different countries where they exchange those tokens for fiat.  Of course, they'd need the right licenses for that, but having billions of dollars, they could get them.
These would be run-of-the-mill electronic currencies.  Reading the passage, this type of currency was also predicted.  Moving value over the internet isn't that hard.  The technology has been there for years.  Heck, there are actual examples of it in practice: Linden Dollars and the like.
The problem is almost nobody wanted these things.  But Bitcoin has taken off.  Why?  Because it's distributed.  That's the fundamental breakthrough. 
If JPMorgan created its own coin tomorrow, nobody would want it.
So the passage doesn't really predict Bitcoin.  For something to predict Bitcoin, it has to describe its distributed nature.  The closest thing I've ever seen to a prediction about Bitcoin is cypherpunk Tim May a decade ago talking about how he thought someone should apply BitTorrent's distributed nature to anonymous digital cash (which had until then been centralized).

Bitcoin wasn't invented to redistribute wealth.  It was invented to be a trustless distributed currency.
Having said that, I believe it will lead to a far more equitable distribution of wealth than the dollar.  
Some economic inequality is simply due to the fact that in a free market economy, some people get rich by providing things that others want.  I don't have a problem with this because the people getting rich aren't screwing everyone else--they're creating wealth.  Bitcoin won't affect this.
However, in today's world, much economic inequality is due to some people screwing others-- bailouts, rent-seeking, inflation, tariffs, subsidies, regulation, etc.  This is where Bitcoin will make a big difference because that stuff will be hard to do in a Bitcoin world.
Today, we're in the early stages.  Like any startup--Apple, Facebook, Intel-- the founders and early investors are going to have more "shares" than everyone else.  It doesn't bother me.  They took a risk, helped get the word out, contributed to the ecosystem.  I don't worry about the current inequality in ownership in Bitcoin because I know in the end, it will be a far fairer system because it helps prevent powerful people from screwing over everyone else.

You're absolutely right.  I see Bitcoin as being able to be understood on at least 3 levels:
* code level
* protocol level
* economics level
I think it's the rare individual who understands it at all 3 levels.  I personally believe I understand it better than most at the economics level, understand it only partially at the protocol level, and not at all on the code level.
A lot of smart programmers understand it at the code level and hence the protocol level, but not at all at the economics level.  They're the ones always talking about "why would anyone want it?" "a deflationary currency will never work" "people ought to spend BTCs instead of hoarding them" etc.

That is the crux of the question: would you rather have one point of failure (the govt) or would you rather have multiple points of failure (companies)?
What I'm "buying" here is a scarce good just like shoes or butter.  The scarce good in this case is "scrutiny" if you will.  And just as I prefer more than one provider of shoes, I prefer more than provider of scrutiny.  
Another place this happens is Amazon.com.  How do I know a 3rd party seller isn't going to rip me off?  Ratings.  There's no central scrutinizer.  It's all a decentralized ratings system.  I'd much prefer that compared to having Amazon.com rating each of their 3rd party sellers.
As far as too much information for the average person to sift through, I don't think that's the case.  The evolution of marketplaces is for things to become easier for people to understand, just like the star-ratings for Amazon.  In Amazon there are basically two variables: the star ratings and the number of reviewers.  That's all the buyer really has to look at.  
It's like the analogy to Bitcoin: when people say that Bitcoin is too hard for the average person to get into, I always reply, "Sure, right now, but there are always tools being built that makes things easier."  I remember having to figure out all this crap back in 2011 about key-pairs, creating a transactions, signing it, transmitting it, etc.  Paper wallets were near impossible at that time.  Today, we got Circle.  Sign up, get some BTCs.  
The internet was very difficult back in 1993.  Today, grandma and grandpa can use it easily.  That's how I look at a potential marketplace for scrutinizers: an evolution from hard to evaluate gradually getting easier.

I know what you're implying: that he doesn't want to use force, that he's an "anarcho-syndicalist" or whatever, etc.   
But that's a contradiction.  Let's say I have a commune and there's no force being used.  But I have a special talent.  Perhaps I'm Michael Jordan.  So now, people want to see me play basketball.  But I won't play unless people voluntarily give up some of their stuff to me.  So even if people give me a very small amount, I'll be a rich man because everyone in the commune gives me a small amount.  Now I'm twice as rich as the next person.  Is that okay in an anarcho-syndicalist commune?  If not, will everyone else claim that I'm exploiting people and use guns to take my stuff?  
If so, then there's no "anarcho-" at all.
If not, then it's not distinguishable from market anarchism.

Hard to justify a $4 million investment like that.
IMO, one of Bitcoin's genius properties is that it has marketing built in.  Once someone buys, they become an ambassador for it since they want to see the price go up.  I don't worry about Bitcoin's marketing: word-of-mouth has already taken it from $0 to $6 billion in 5 years.
On the other hand, a lot of infrastructure has to be built, it's nice to have a little pause before a ton of new users come into the system.

@_date: 2014-07-23 01:58:36
To add:
1) The right amount of regulation and type of regulation is a discovery process.  We don't know the right amount and type of regulation just like we don't know the correct amount of shoes the US needs.  The amount of shoes the US needs is discovered by the market process that uses prices as information.
Trying to determine the right amount of shoes without the market would be foolish.  That's what the USSR tried to do and they got it wrong and it led to shortages and surpluses.  It's central planning which never works.  For the same reason, the right amount of type of regulation is something central planners like Ben Lawsky cannot know a priori. It's something to be discovered via the trial and error of the market.  It might or might not include a certain amount of capital reserves for exchanges, multi-signature transactions, cryptographic proof of reserves, third-party audits, and more.  Any subset might be optimal.  At this point, we don't know a priori.
When central planners make regulations, they usually throw the kitchen sink at the problem.  This is usually overkill.
2) Centrally planned regulation does not evolve quickly unlike the trial-and-error evolution of the marketplace.  Further, it provides the pretense of safety to consumers when in reality there's no guarantee of protection.  See Lehman et al.
3) Centrally planned regulation introduces systemic risk.  If all institutions use the same procedures for security and risk protection, and an exploit is found, then all institutions suffer when something goes wrong.  In contrast, if there's a market for protection and security, those firms with better practices survive, and systemic risk doesn't exist.  The risk is isolated to the institution, not the system.  This is why the Bitcoin ecosystem thrives today despite Mt. Gox.
Honestly, when Lawsky talks, I see the same ignorance and arrogance of every central planner that ever lived.

Well, one solution is on the front page of this subreddit.  Look at what Coinbase is doing.  Coins in a multisig wallet aren't suspectible to Goxxing.
It didn't take legislation or regulation to spur on this innovation.  It took experience and a marketplace of ideas.  Coinbase does not want to be the next Mt. Gox.  They don't want to go bust or go to jail.  It's in their interest to take steps to prevent that.
It's not "anarchy" (as you imagine it) that's the solution; it's a market.  
If anything, regulations destroy markets because they raise the barriers to entry.  Long term, if you want to prevent more Mt Gox's, you'd fight regulation, not support it.

That's okay, and there's nothing wrong with that.  You don't have to buy Bitcoin or be "involved in the community" or anything like that.  You can use the existing system.
It's a good lesson for Bitcoiners too: not everyone has to be a Bitcoin fan.  I certainly am, but it doesn't mean my parents have to be.  There are enough options for everyone.
Heck, I think Bitcoin's fundamental promise is as a store of value (yes volatility exists but it's in a largely appreciating asset as seen over the six years of its history), not as a payment system, and that view puts me in a much different mindset than most other Bitcoin fans.  Not all fans have to agree.
Basically what I'm getting at is there can be more than one option for money, payment systems, remittances, etc.  Bitcoin is one of those options.  Not everyone has to like it nor use it.

But the people themselves are not blameless.  Gox had a pock-marked history.  They stopped USD withdrawals in mid 2013.  They had terrible access issues when the Apr 2013 bubble popped.  They are an exchange, not a place to park BTCs.  The whole point of Bitcoin is to eliminate 3rd parties you have to trust.  Parking coins at Mt Gox defeats this purpose.

And in 6 months, why buy a computer then when I can buy an even more powerful computer in 12 months?
Under this theory, the deflation of technology prices should result in nobody buying technology goods, and the economy for tech grinding to a halt.

This is in contrast to your question about what happens if a "natural" monopoly arises and your own answer that it has to be stamped out by a force monopoly.  I'd rather live in a an imperfect world with such a "natural" monopoly.  This is far from utopian.  I acknowledge and can live with flaws.  You need to stamp them out with a govt.
"Security IS monopoly. If these things--- laws and security--- didn't have "monopolies," they wouldn't be law or security at all. They would be legal-games and security-firms."
Interesting.  On the world scale, there isn't a monopoly on law and security.  We have many nations with many sets of laws, and may militaries supplying security to these many nations.  There is no supra-national government that monopolizes law at the world level, nor world military.

I thought Gavin did great.  He was the best at explaining Bitcoin in layman's terms.  I really like his laid-back, humble nature in interviews and public events.  Some other thoughts:
* The moderator knew a surprising amount about Bitcoin.  That's usually not been the case at similar conferences.
* Interesting how 10-year predictions were so different from mine.  Some of the panelists said basically that it would replace money transfer mechanisms like ACH, wires, SEPA, SWIFT, etc.  I think that's just a minor achievement.  Nobody mentioned Distributed Autonomous Organizations, for example--a massive disruption to the status quo.
* I really disagree with the idea that more regulation would've prevented Mt. Gox.  It may have or may not have.  What we do know is that it's nearly impossible to start a fully regulatory-compliant exchange in the US, and the ones that did start up like Bitfloor and Tradehill had to shut down due to regulations.  The only way most Americans could actually buy Bitcoins was to go to Bitstamp or Mt. Gox.  Regulation screwed over many Americans.

Remember, Bitcoin is not like fiat.  It's like cash on the internet.  If someone steals BTCs from Circle, whether it be hackers or even people inside the company, there's no getting it back.
Sure, Circle might "make you whole" by dipping into its own funds, but that only leads to a worsening profit/loss position on their books.  That's how fractional reserve leads to ponzi's.  
Anyway, I can't convince anyone who doesn't want to be convinced that it's risky keeping your coins with them.

Nah, as an ancap, I love the Constitution.  It's design is fairly clear: a govt of limited, clearly defined powers, distributed into 3 branches.  Even today, that's a very progressive (as in progress, not leftist) idea.
Problem is, it was written in a time before anyone knew anything about economics, especially the public choice school, which only really arose over the last few decades.  It turns out those 3 branches actually tend to empower each other rather than check each other.  
It was a grand experiment; it failed.  But we learned.

Okay, but one more clarification.  Yes, in theory, govt solutions could be better than free market solutions.
But in a democracy, I'm not voting for a solution.  I'm not voting for a regulation.  There is a regulator making a regulation.  Heck, I'm not even voting for a regulator.
What I'm actually voting for is a politician who will appoint a regulator who will make a regulation.  There are incentives involved in this process, too.  
There are lots of potential proposed solutions to any market failure.  What are the chances that the correct solution will make it through this incentive structure (vote ---&gt; politician ---&gt; regulator ---&gt; regulation)?  My guess is that the solution that will be implemented is the one that is favored by the regulator appointed by the politician as a result of who donated the most money to his campaign.  No, not every single time, but most times.
So this is why libertarians prefer the heuristic "no government interference".  It's not because:
-- we think markets are perfect
-- we don't think government solutions could be better
-- we're irrational selfish assholes
It's because, as a rule of thumb, we see the regulation process in a democracy as having terrible incentives very unlikely to result in wise regulation.

You think you're clever; fine.  Keep thinking that.  But if you have any ounce of open-mindedness, at least take the time to understand the people arguing against you.
Most libertarians and ancaps like myself have a deep belief in the necessity of property rights.  It's obvious to us that there need to be enforceable rules against murder, theft, fraud, and the like.  You seem to blend "regulation" into this.  That's not what libertarians and ancaps mean by regulation, and it's not what people in govt mean by regulation.  
What they mean by regulation is greater restrictions on voluntary exchanges.  For example, I can't trade with someone in country XYZ even though we both want to.  That's a regulation.  Or I can't invest in a startup even though I want to because the govt is regulating me.  Or I can't start driving people to various places for money even though I have a driver's license and a spotless traffic record.  
The word regulation, I'm sure sounds warm and fuzzy to you, but to us, it means the powerful keeping the little guy out of the market.   You probably haven't heard of the "Baptist and the Bootlegger" dynamic inherent in all regulation; take a few minutes to google it.  You're probably a Baptist; no self-respecting Bootlegger would admit it.  
So yes, I do take an all-or-none view of regulation.  I want none.  There are already laws against murder, theft, and fraud.  There are courts to adjudicate claims.  There are cops to catch bad guys.  All other regulation being proposed is simply a way keep competition out despite what its proponents might argue, and I'm against ALL of it.
If you understand all this and still love regulation, that's great.  I won't be able to change your mind.  But realize you're not a forward-thinking type; just naive.

With Bitcoin as currency, the value is decentralization.  Contrary to popular belief, Bitcoin is not cheap because it's peer-to-peer.  Rather, it's cheap because of the miner subsidy.  Any *modern* centralized system would be way cheaper.  The fundamental value of Bitcoin is that nobody is in charge, so it's incorruptible.  And miners spend a lot of hashing power and money to keep it that way.
What's the point in clearing NASDAQ trades with Bitcoin?  NASDAQ is already a centralized hub.  Why not just pair it with a centralized *modern* clearinghouse?

@_date: 2014-10-05 21:07:28
Sure, it's hard for someone to buy 10000 today.
But it's not that hard to buy 1 today.  There are probably millions of people in the US who could buy 1, who know about Bitcoin, but won't do it.  Why not?  Because they evaluate the risk/reward and choose not to.  Yet, I'm fairly certain that two years from now, they'll regret it.
The point I'm making is that when the guy bought the pizza with 10,000 bitcoins, there were plenty of people who could've bought bitcoins but didn't.  Many people actually mined them but then lost them because they didn't think they'd amount to anything.
Let's do a thought experiment.  A magic Bitcoin fairy snaps her fingers and everyone in the world gets an equal # of bitcoins.  Nobody has any more or any less than anyone else.  There are markets to buy and sell bitcoins.  What happens next?
I guarantee you that 99% of people will sell their bitcoins for what the market will bear.  And that 1% will gladly buy these bitcoins.  And you'll get the same or nearly the same distribution of ownership you have today.
I don't find this unfair.  Everyone has a choice.  If a market exists, the people who don't own any today are choosing not to buy any today, just like I chose not to buy any at $1 in April 2011 when I first heard about them.

"While not a proper exchange" is exactly right.  They withdraw and deposit funds directly from your bank account so they don't need to comply with the onerous costs of being an exchange.

Everyone and their grandmother seems to be using this argument:  "It's not that great as money, but it's great to move money!"
I think the opposite is true.  It's actually not that great a money transmitter system.  The true costs are being hidden from the consumer right now because of seniorage to miners.  When the block reward drops, transaction costs will increase substantially.  
A centralized digital currency would be way, way cheaper and faster than Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is purposely expensive (proof-of-work) to keep it decentralized.  
The transaction mechanism isn't Bitcoin's competitive advantage.  Rather, its competitive advantage is that it's a decentralized store of value, much like gold, but with some advantages like being able to be transferred online.
The reason most people don't see this is:
1) Most people don't understand Bitcoin, especially non-nerds like Steve Forbes, Peter Schiff, etc.  
2) Most people don't even understand why gold has value, so there's no way they're going to understand why a digital analogue of gold will have value.
But they understand how Bitcoin's transaction system is better than wires, Swift, etc so that's what they latch on to.

2) Ease of getting into Bitcoin, i.e., you can sit at home, fire up your etrade account and buy "bitcoins" without wiring money overseas, waiting a few days for the wire to clear, take the risk of the exchange shutting down, etc.

Exactly.  I'm surprised OP is surprised.  How exactly do people think regulation works?
People need to let go of the fairy tale that regulators are out to protect the public like we were taught in school.  Anyone who barely scratches the surface and studies the actual effects of regulation see what we see in Lawsky: regulation is the means by which the powerful prey on the weak.  The incentives are much more powerful for regulators to get captured by special interests than they are for the public to be actually protected by virtuous, knowledgeable regulators.

I disagree slightly.  Yes, there is innovation with Uber.  The only reason is that Uber got a head start and started operating and satisfying customers before the regulators could put a stop to them.  
Taxi cartels have been screwing over customers for years.  Taxis should never have been a one-size-fits-all solution.  The taxi industry should have been "open access" to anyone wanting to provide rides.  Standards should have been set by what customers desire, not what bureaucrats decide.  The only reason this isn't the case is that a few taxi companies got together, formed a cartel, bought off the local govts, and kept competition out.

In order to save, you have to have your spending needs met.  IOW, the first $200 goes to food, the second $200 goes to rent/mortgage, the third $200 goes to gas, and on until you finally have $200 to save.
The poor are hurt by inflation because the prices of stuff goes up.  Spending is prior to saving.

Indeed that is a charitable view.  What's wrong with that view is that the solution is *nearly always* worse than the problem.  
The problem arises because of human failures: poor incentives, lack of information, coordination problems, etc.  Yes, these are real problems that arise as we go from savagery to civilization.
The proposed solution--"regulation"--is simply using a group of people--"regulators"--to fix what is a human problem with a bunch of humans.  Regulators, in general, have even worse incentives, worse information, worse coordination problems, etc.  Why?  Because they're backed by violence.  Note that this is not a moral argument.  I'm not saying violence is evil.  I'm saying violence doesn't improve upon human failures, and more often than not, makes them worse, because the group of humans with violent power at their disposal have worse incentives, worse information, and worse coordination problems.
Those of use who favor simply a free market of strongly enforced property rights have been arguing for years that regulation is simply a means for the strong/organized to prey on the weak/disorganized.  
Yes, you can support strong regulation AND Bitcoin because the code regulates Bitcoin trustlessly.  But I suspect that the reason Bitcoin is so attractive to libertarians is that they see a way remove human regulation without interference and create an inviolable system of property rights.  Bitcoin is the ultimate one-way property function.  And I'd be will to be that people who believe in strong regulation are, on the whole, going to find Bitcoin distasteful.

Wall Street is dominated by decades-old, sometimes hundred years-old company like Goldman Sachs, Morgan Stanley, and JP Morgan.

Just a side note: it's not just Austrians that are pro- free markets.  There are also neo-classical economists of the "Chicago school", and more recently, public choice economists.  
I agree-- everyone does not have the time to do their own research into what ingredients are in the cough syrup.  We have enough stuff to worry about.  So we hand off this task to a third party.  At this point we have two options: 
1) A monopoly 3rd party, i.e., govt, i.e., regulator  
2) An open market for regulation
Those are the ONLY two options (until trustless systems like Bitcoin are available for this kind of thing).  Both of them have drawbacks.  But which of these flawed choices is better?  
I submit it's the second one.  It allows for competition, evolution, and is ultimately beholden to the people via the market process.  The former is monopolistic, changes VERY slowly, and is beholden to the people via the political process, i.e., special interest groups that pay for politicians' campaigns.

Nature wants one money whenever possible.  Only when a single money is not ideal for all uses does it seek out other money.  The only reason silver was used as money is that gold was too valuable for day-to-day transactions--even a tiny ditzel is worth more than your morning coffee.  On the other hand, silver wasn't valuable enough for large transactions--you'd need hundreds of pounds of it.  That's why two moneys existed traditionally.
The reason Bitcoin is seen as the ONE AND ONLY digital currency is that until proven otherwise, it is flexible enough for nearly everything and massive network effects are already in place.

At steady-state, the long term price growth of BTCs should equal the rate of growth of the economy.  If the economy grows at 2.5% in the year 2145, then the value of each BTC should grow at 2.5%.  This is because the number of BTCs in circulation is fixed and technology/productivity increases make things cheaper.  (There will be various times when it'll grow faster or slower due to economic crises, etc, but I'm talking about the average growth in price.)
For the average joe, this will be a great way to save money: just leave it alone.  You don't have to be a speculator like you do today.
For entrepreneurs, they will choose to invest/spend if they think their idea will yield a greater than 2.5% return/year.
For "banks" (whatever they looks like in the future), they will have to offer &gt;2.5% interest to get people to deposit with them.

Let's talk some basic shit here.  Democracy is lionized by modern society, but it's important to recognize some of its shortcomings.  Reddit is a useful example.
Any unpopular idea on Reddit is downvoted.  If I go into any "general user" thread and say, "Socialism is bad for the economy", my comment will be downvoted to deletion.  It won't even be visible.
This mechanism works great for easy issues like, "The moon is made of cheese" or "George W. Bush is the son of George H.W. Bush".  Those are easily verifiable statements.  Voting works well to determine truth.
But... does it always work well?  
Why doesn't Apple have a vote to determine iPhone features?  Why not have Reddit users vote on whether to make the screen bigger?
Why doesn't Twitter do the same?  Why not have Reddit users determine whether or not to increase the character limit above 140?
The answer--quite unintuitive--is that voting is a terrible way to decide *most* things.  That's right, **voting is awful for most decisions**.
Why?  That's even more unintuitive: it's because voting is costless.  Let's unpackage that a bit:
When I buy a car, I pay $30K.  If I buy a great car for me, I capture all the benefit of that decision.  I get to drive it.  I get to feel good in it.  Nobody else does unless I let them.  If I buy a crappy car, I capture all the downside of that decision.  I'm the one stuck with it, making the repairs, suffering its shortcomings.  Nobody else does.
When I vote, I pay very little.  Let's say I'm in a big family of 10 brothers, all of whom will be driving the car we buy, and which car we buy will be determined by a vote.  We will contributing $3K each.  I have way less incentive to research the various car brands/models, try to find the cheapest deal, read consumer reports, test drive each one, etc.  Same with each of my brothers.
If I vote well, I'm not the only one who benefits--all my brothers do.  In other words, I capture 1/10th the benefit of a good decision.  If I vote to buy a crappy car, I'm not the only one who suffers--all my brothers do.  In other words, I capture 1/10th the downside of a bad decision.
In this scenario, voting will yield way worse of a decision.  There's little upside for me in making a good purchase and little downside for me in making a bad decision.  
That's why voting is a terrible way to make most decisions.  And why markets are better.  The difference between the two methods above is that the first is a market (person captures all the consequences of decision) and the second is democracy (person captures a small fraction of all the consequences of a decision).  This is known as "rational ignorance":
Lucky for us, Bitcoin is much more of a market than a democracy.  Protocol changes are rare and made by people invested in the system.
Voting for protocol changes on Reddit is just about the dumbest idea I've ever heard.  It will destroy Bitcoin.  The day this happens is the day I sell all of my bitcoins.

"Backing" means you can trade the asset in for whatever backs it. When dollars were backed by gold, you could take $20 to a bank and get an ounce of good in exchange. 
So you're correct. Bitcoin, like gold, has no backing. What people seem to imply with the "backing" usage is, "What gives Bitcoin value?" but they sloppily use the wrong  terms.

Yet here we are in a world in which everything you say on the internet is spied upon.  
Same thinking with banking in the 1970s.  It was way, way easier to hide money in tax shelters back then.  Today it's impossible.  Don't think a decentralized system stays decentralized just because of popular support.  Instead, it has to be decentralized in structure.

2) to perform anonymous exchanges online for black market items

Sure, but that's not the argument. The question isn't whether everyone would be safer with no guns in existence. That question isn't based on reality.
Rather, the question is everyone would be safer is *some* people had guns while the rest didn't. 
In the US, if you try to get rid of guns, you need some other people with guns to go around and take everyone else's guns. And since Americans are generally a stubborn and independent bunch, they'll resist, so those people doing the taking will need even more powerful guns. And even then, they'll likely not be successful. And if they are successful, that's scary too because there's a massive power imbalance. History is replete with massacres and holocausts. We don't need another in America. 
So people who say they are in favor of gun control for America aren't really for gun control.  They are in favor of guns, but only want an elite few to have them and leave the rest of us at their mercy.

Here's an alternate view:  the price drop had nothing to do with Hearn's blogpost or the NY Times article or the videos of the banker conference.  Shit, the drop wasn't even close to the magnitude of a couple of dozen other drops seen previously.  Sometimes people sell in large numbers.  The reasons are nebulous.  The human mind has to make sense of the world and part of the consequence involves seeing patterns where there are none.

Hmm...?  Not sure I understand.  My argument is that the "private blockchain" phenomenon is a temporary blip... a bubble piggybacking off the real value of decentralized blockchains.  
Perhaps you don't agree--that's fine.  But surely you can imagine that if you believed what I believe, it's better to call out nonsense for what it is, way before people lose a lot of money.  Otherwise the baby (Bitcoin) will get thrown out with the hyped bathwater (private blockchains) when the emperor is found to have no clothes.

Right, and May was in part inspired by Chaum (and also by True Names by Vernor Vinge).  But May was the one that coalesced the movement (cypherpunks) which Nick Szabo was clearly a part of and likely inspired Nakamoto.  
Chaum wasn't really involved in the cypherpunks at all.  IIRC, the cypherpunks were frustrated that he owned the patents to "anonymous digital cash" but wasn't doing much with it after the failure of Digicash.

Sure it can.
At a future point, the Bitcoin supply, for all intents and purposes, will stop growing.  But the economy will keep growing.  It usually grows around 2-5% a year in industrialized nations.  That means, long term, Bitcoin's price will grow 2-5% on average.  Key words are "long term" and "on average", but it will keep rising forever.

Keep in mind that there is a difference between a conspiracy and incentives.  For example, when someone in sports throws a game to win a bet, there's no conspiracy.  It's simply an incentive: if he loses the game, he gets money.  A conspiracy involves many parties all keeping a secret yet coordinating actions among each other.  This is nearly impossible to pull off.
When Bitcoiners like myself talk about how regulations help keep incumbents in power, it isn't an accusation of conspiracy.  Rather, it's an accusation of poor incentives: politicians have an incentive to get elected; special interests have an incentive to donate money to politicians' election campaigns in order to garner favors from the politicians; the public at large does NOT have an incentive to be a watchdog because the benefits of doing so are diffuse; the benefits for the special interests are concentrated.

I don't think there's an easy explanation for any price movement, let alone any bubble.
I first bought Bitcoin in 2011 on the theory that we know exactly how many bitcoins are going to exist at any given time from here to eternity, but don't know how many dollars or how much gold will exist.  And because of its deflationary money supply function, it should grow in value over time.  
I think for that reason, the price has increased 500-fold.  And because no asset moves in a straight line, there are bubbles and crashes along the way, each crash weeding out the weak hands, and each new bubble reflecting growing public awareness of Bitcoin's properties.  Trying to assign cause-and-effect to each ripple is storytelling at best.
Long term, the only theory that matters is that it's a deflationary asset unlike anything that's ever existed before (and it has a network effect so similarly deflationary copycats won't be successful).

To me, "cash" means a finality of an exchange, not a debit or credit, and no third-parties.  Once the exchange occurs, there's no going back unless both parties agree to another exchange.  This idea fits with gold since for millenia, gold was the base-layer of all financial transactions.

The idea that all Nasdaq transactions should be on the blockchain is absolutely insane.  That can't happen nor will it ever happen.  Centralized systems will always be millions (billions, trillions,...) of times faster and cheaper than blockchains.

I agree with just about all of your posts, but I don't agree with this one.
A lower fee per transaction does not imply lower fees in aggregate.
Fee/transactions x # of transactions = total fees
Somehow the argument for a fee market has been made that, "Well, we need to up the first number to increase total fees."  I don't buy it.  It may well be that the biggest fees to miners occurs with millions of very very low fee transactions per block.

Not really.  There will be a return on investment in Bitcoin.  If people aren't investing in businesses with their Bitcoin, then the potential return on investing in those potential businesses will rise.  At some point, those potential returns will grow much larger than the expected return of just holding Bitcoin.  Entrepreneurs will invest.
A more concrete hypothetical:  Suppose it's 2002 in a Bitcoin world.  People are holding Bitcoin, and Bitcoin goes up every year, on average.  Some years it goes down, but in general it goes up 5% a a year (just a round number used for this hypothetical).
Somebody has an idea for a social network like Facebook.  But to start such a project, they would have to spend their Bitcoins.  But Bitcoin is going up 5% a year!  No thanks!
Now it's 2003, and that somebody's Bitcoin has gone up 5%.  But there is still no Facebook out there.  Smart phones are on the horizon, just a couple of years away.  Blackberries are everywhere.  The world is ripe for a social network. But Bitcoin is going up 5% a year!  No thanks!
Now it's 2004.  Friendster is huge, but the interface is clunky.  Our somebody really really thinks Facebook is a great idea.  But Bitcoin is going up 5% a year!  BUT... if he doesn't start Facebook, somebody else will.  And he knows that he'll make more with Facebook, if it takes off, than even Bitcoin.  So he parts ways with his Bitcoin and starts Facebook.
It's really no different than today.  You could keep your money in the bank for a 2% return, or in CDs for a 3% return.  Why should anyone spend their money?  Because they need food, shelter, etc.  And they wants stuff like TVs and vacations.  Why should anyone invest in a starting a business?  Because the expected return will be higher than 3%.

I think this shows that Bitcoin-as-remittance-platform makes no sense.  In the future when Bitcoin is used as the primary form of money, then sure.  People will no longer have to convert out to fiat.
But in today's world, what people care about is using fiat as the primary medium-of-exchange, the conversion from Bitcoin to fiat, and vice-versa, costs too much to make it worthwhile to use Bitcoin as remittance.

Not sure that's true.  The price of BTC is also a prediction of its future prospects.  If you knew without a doubt that in two weeks, the price would drop by $2000, you'd sell, and so would everyone else, and so the price would already be at $5200.  
If you don't buy that argument, then you can also look at BTC futures, all of which are between $6700 and $7200.

Well, it's obvious you aren't used to high level argumentation, so let me spell it out for you.
When you were little, did your parents ever say to you, "So if all your friends jumped off a building, you would too?"  If you grew up in the US, there was probably a time or two or three when your mom or dad asked you that question.  
Perhaps you wanted to go swimming in the lake or stay out later than usual.  And they wouldn't let you.  So you protested, "But all my friends are going!"  
And they pulled out the questions, "So if all your friends all jumped off a building, you would too?"
Did you understand the point of that question?  
I'm assuming by your interaction with me that you didn't.  In fact, you probably concluded that your parents thought that staying out late was *literally* the same as jumping off a building.
So let me correct you and revise your faulty opinion of your parents' faculties: your parents were engaging in a Socratic exercise in which they were drawing a comparison.  In this case, they were comparing two different situations in which social proof leads to very different outcomes--that just because your friends are all doing something doesn't mean it's the wise thing to do.  Again, they were *comparing*, not saying that the two different things were *literally the same*.
So, to get back to the topic at hand.  No, I emphatically do not believe that taxation is "literally" torture or even metaphorically.  Nor do I think Obama is Hitler.  Why would I?  That's crazy.  What I was doing, rather, was drawing a comparison between two different situations in which the govt decrees something to be legal but result in very different reactions in most people's minds.  If you don't understand this simple argument, I mean, if you actually thought I was saying that taxation is "literally" torture, or that for whatever reason, I think Obama is Hitler, it's probably best to not engage in any sort of debate at all.  You're not made for it.

Okay look, if all moral reasoning comes down simply to "I prefer this" or "I prefer that", then there's nothing to be argued at all about morality.  It's simply all negotiation.  And actually, I'm somewhat sympathetic to that mode to reasoning.
But most people actually have deeper reasons for not endorsing theft and torture.  If the argument is that taxation isn't theft because the govt says it isn't, then by extension, torture by the CIA isn't torture because the govt says it isn't.  Most people who believe taxation isn't theft, though, continue to believe that torture by the CIA is still torture.

A modern centralized system would not need miners, but rather, just a secure database.  It would basically be costless.

Proof-of-work is not about efficiency.  It's about decentralization.  Proof-of-work is purposely inefficient in order to achieve decentralization.

The whole currency thing is easy to understand if you look at it differently: Bitcoin is going to be the base layer of the world's currencies.  Currencies will be built "on top" of Bitcoin.  
They will likely be centralized or quasi-centralized because you don't need exchange-use currencies to be decentralized.  You don't need your coffee purchase to be decentralized.  So you'll have hundreds or thousands of transactions that will be periodically "cleared" with a single on-chain transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain, and this will be the decentralized transaction.  
In other words, each decentralized transaction will contain the effects of hundreds or thousands of centralized transactions.
Of course, even if Bitcoin is only used as a settlement asset or a clearing mechanism, it still needs lower volatility.  And it will get there.  $100 billion is too small; a $100 million dollar purchase could rock the price 25% (let's say). 
That's why it needs to be much, much higher in network value, something like $10 trillion, to have low volatility.  And I believe it will get there.

I also find consequentialist arguments more convincing.  But most people who protest the argument that taxation is theft (or robbery as you say) make poor arguments like, "But you get something in return" or "No, you choose to pay taxes because you don't move to a place with zero taxes."  They're also very inconsistent in their beliefs across the board (hence why I brought up torture).
I wish they would simply say, "Yes it's theft/robbery, but without it, civilization would collapse, and thus, taxes are a necessary evil."  In fact, I think that deep down, this is what they think, and they think that giving ground on the theft/robbery argument weakens their necessary evil argument.
@_date: 2015-08-25 21:19:18

Completely useless analysis.  Their $400 target will be seen as silly in just a few months.
Bitcoin can't be given a price target.  The potential outcomes vary way too much.  At best, it can be given a range of prices, and this range has to span magnitudes.  
You can't pretend it's a stock and put a single price on it.
And in the end, remittance as a use-case is overrated.  Bitcoin doesn't need a high valuation for use in remittance, nor are there closed-loops in remittance that avoid the legacy fiat system completely.
The reason Bitcoin has value is that it's an algorithmically-limited supply of non-counterparty risk tokens that can be transferred online.  Nothing else like that with such a network effect exists in the world.

Anything that hurts decentralization hurts Bitcoin.  
I hope, more than anything, that the two camps in the blocksize debate cherish decentralization.  At best, the disagreement is merely about whether or not increasing the blocksize hurts decentralization.  I'm not smart enough to come to a conclusion on this.  But buying coffee with Bitcoin?

Sounds like a business opportunity.  If people won't accept Bitcoin, surely they'll accept a different coin with a different wealth distribution.  The idiot should start his own coin, keep 1% of it, and give the rest away by lottery, and have miners collect fees.  He'll still profit handsomely and the distribution will be more to his liking.

You act like this is some deep insight.  I speak as a fan of Taleb, but public choice economists have been talking about this for decades.  
And Lawsky is not some one-time event.  This is the MODAL behavior of regulators.  The reason I and so many others are against regulation is because aside from the defense of property rights, which I don't consider to be "regulation" per se, regulation is simply corruption.
There's not "good regulation" or "bad regulation".  That sort of dichotomy ignores incentives.  With monopoly enforcement, regulation is inherently corrupt.  Ask yourself, Why the hell *should* Lawsky make good regulation?  What will he get out of it?  Will he be remembered by history as a benign regulator?  No, he will quickly be forgotten.  Will he gain financially?  No, he'll keep his decent paying Superindendent job.  The only way he'll truly benefit is to enact a monstrosity that helps his buddies in industry now, and for the future, market himself as the guy who knows the right people and navigate the rules he himself enacted.  
Incentives from regulation result in corruption *with regularity*.  Sure, good regulation could theoretically be possible, but people who would enact good regulation don't exactly end up in Lawsky's position, nor do they stay incorruptible if they somehow get there.  
This is why regulation has to stay private.  User reviews, independent for-profit ratings agencies, etc like what Amazon, Ebay, and Uber created are much less corrupting than a Department of This or National Department That.  They are freely chosen by consumers (if I don't like Amazon's regulation of its member stores, I shop elsewhere, whereas if NY State passes crappy regulation, I have to move out of state, and if the US passes crappy regulation, I have to move overseas).  They also evolve as the marketplace matures and changes.  The US, on the other hand, still has a mohair subsidy.

I don't think Bitcoin transactions will be costless long term.  In fact, I think they'll cost quite a bit.
But that doesn't mean *financial* transactions can't be essentially costless.  This will happen off-chain.  Of course, if it's via trusted third party, it will not be censorship-resistant, but the vast majority of transactions don't need to be.  If it's via a sidechain, it might even be censorship-resistant but have lower security, which again, for the vast majority of transcations, would suffice.

I agree.  There should be a law against lobbying.  This law will be enforced by a commission appointed by the Congress and President.  And in order to get elected, the Congress and President will have to run election campaigns.  So the commission will make sure the candidates for Congress and President only take the minimal acceptable amount of money needed to run the campaign.  After winning the elections, Congress and President will reappoint people to the commission. 
This sounds like it will work perfectly.  We need to take the money out of politics.

Yes, that's the case for me, but then, I only use it as a store of value.  That's when decentralization matters.
I don't care if the currency I use to buy stuff with is centralized.  


I think this is inevitable.  If you don't need to replicate a ledger among all nodes, costs will be far less.


Again, I think this is inevitable.  We'll have "high powered money" on the blockchain itself, and centralized services on top of that which are low fee.  I don't see this as a problem: we use debit, credit, cash, and checks today.

You're right Bitcoin is not backed by math.  It's backed by nothing.  When the dollar was backed by gold, you could walk into a bank with $20 and they would have to give you an ounce of gold.  Now that the dollar is not backed by gold, you can no longer walk into a bank with dollars and get gold.
If Bitcoin was backed by math, you could walk into a bank and give them bitcoins and they'd have to give you math back.  Since that's nonsensical, Bitcoin is not backed by math.  It's backed by nothing.
Where you're wrong is the idea that what gives Bitcoin money is people using it to buy stuff with.  Nobody buys stuff with gold, yet it has value.  Nobody bought stuff, at least not frequently, with the Yap stones.  
What gives Bitcoin is its Network Effect.  This is a deeply unintuitive argument.  People give Bitcoin value because others give Bitcoin value, and those others give Bitcoin value because they know others will value it.  It's a Network Effect.
So I'm going to keep HOLDING my Bitcoins, not spending them.  Bitcoin's network effect is strong.  What I want to signal to the world is that I desire bitcoins, and I don't find other things more valuable than bitcoins, so I have no desire to get rid of them by spending them.

Trying to understand Armstrong's motivation here (since lots of people have questioned Blockstream's motivation):
I suppose that every day, Coinbase clears a bunch of its offchain transactions on-chain.  Currently, this happens for a very low fee.  Without a block size limit fee increase, fees will increase.  Coinbase will spend a lot more money clearing transactions.  Hence, Armstrong's recent quite vocal advocacy for a block size increase.  The survival of his business could well be on the line.  Just guessing.

Okay, here's the thing though.  The seamless and hassle-free part is either around the corner or already here (in many parts of the world).  In China and large parts of Europe, using traditional parts of the financial system is a pretty nice experience.  It's nearly free, too.
The only thing you mentioned that Bitcoin excels at compared to the traditional financial system is "borderless".  That's because borderlessness requires censorship resistance.  Remember, Bitcoins spends a lot of time, energy, and money to send all nodes a copy of the ledger (blockchain).  There's only one reason to do that: censorship resistance.  Otherwise, it's a waste of time, energy, and money.
So Bitcoin's unique properties are all related to censorship resistance.  That includes: borderlessness and resistance to arbitrary inflation.
Everything else people might want in money: seamless, hassle-free, fast, cheap, etc is better suited for centralized currencies.  Centralized currencies may be slow and hassle-full today, but in many parts of the world, they're not, and for everywhere else, it's only a matter of time.
My hope is that these seamless, hassle-free, fast, cheap, etc centralized currencies are built on top of Bitcoin so that my Bitcoins accrue more value, but I wouldn't be shocked if they're not.

That's not a bad idea, but it's a bit naive.  
Most times, it's very rational for a faction to vote in big govt at the expense of everyone else.
For example, let's say there's proposed legislation to simplify the legal system, or even to improve it like having the loser of the case paying for legal fees.  That would destroy 90% of civil lawsuits instantly.  
However, lawyers and their various public policy influence groups have a lot to lose from such legislation and much to gain from defeating it.  We're talking hundreds of billions of dollars.  For each lawyer, it might be $10,000, on average (I'm just making up numbers for demonstration).
However, there are many more citizens in America than lawyers, so that hundreds of billions saved inside the legal system may only benefit each individual $1000.
So lawyers have a much, much greater incentive (thousand-fold) to make sure the legislation is defeated than each citizen has to make sure it's passed.  They're much more likely to donate to the right politicians and get their favored politicians elected than the public is to elect someone who will do the right thing.
This is just one example.  There are thousands upon thousands of interest groups (lobbies, Big Oil, AARP, NEA, DEA, cops in general, unions, corporations, etc) that all have this economic incentive structure because of democracy.  And most times the ratio isn't merely 1000-fold, but more like a million-fold.
Basically, the incentive to pass rules that favor factions are much greater than to veto them because benefits are focused and costs are dispersed. 
Democracy is what fuels this dynamic.

A credit default swap is a bet.  That's it.  Buying a stock is also making a bet: that the future of the underlying company is bright.  Buying an option is a bet.  As is buying futures, gold, and baseball cards.  She created a way to make more bets.
You know what the biggest thing in the crypto world is right now?  There are people trying to create fully functional decentralized prediction markets.  In other words, they are trying to create a way to bet on just about anything including whether it will rain next Monday or who will win the Oscar for best picture this year.
Yet somehow a large part of Reddit Bitcoin trots out this nonsense about her "destroying the economy".  It's anti-intellectual gibberish.
She didn't destroy the economy.  Neither did credit default swaps.  The economy periodically gets destroyed for various reasons.  Some people see it coming and decide to make bets on it and make money.  The ignorant blame the people who make the bets rather than the underlying cause, whatever it might be.
If I bet that Wisconsin is going to beat Alabama this weekend and I win, my bet did not cause Alabama to lose, nor did I.  The bet is a prediction about the future.  So is the credit default swap.

I can dig that argument, though I can't evaluate its merit.  I simply don't know the economics and technical variables well enough to make that judgment.
What I can say, though, is the argument that "We'll get everyone using Bitcoin and that will make it valuable" without consideration of censorship resistance seems false to me.  The day that only a few central points of failure exist in the ecosystem is the day central bankers will take control.  At that point, the price of Bitcoin will rapidly approach zero as neither censorship resistance, nor the 21M limit (which is merely an extension of censorship resistance) will be in safe.

Not sure what accounting books you're talking about.  CDS have no books.  They simply have a price.
They are just as simple as puts.  Right now I can buy GE puts...
...which are bets that GE will suffer in the future.  Each put has a specific price and date.  A GE $13 Jan 2016 put means that I can bet the price of the GE stock will fall down to below $13 by Jan 2016.  If it does, I will probably make a lot of money.  Current price is $0.09 for such a bet.
There are puts for companies, but no puts for other things like governments.  So Masters invented them.  A CDS is essentially just a put on a government (or other things).  That's all.  It has a price and a term structure.  There are no accounting books.

The reason for the "be your own bank" stuff is that until now, it was nearly impossible to secure a large chunk of wealth on your own.  If you accrued a decent amount of assets, you either had a pile of gold or a pile of cash.  Sure you could keep it under your mattress, but it's way more convenient to give it to someone else to secure.
Of course, the result was that you were able to get your money back from the bank 99% of the time, but 1% of the time, you lost all your money.  So any method to avoid banks is probably a good thing in the long run.
If money is purely a ledger as with Bitcoin, you can indeed keep a lot of money outside the bank.  No more bank runs.

So ideally there's a balance between too many businesses starting up and too few.  That balance is usually dictated by price signals, like most things in a healthy economy, and the particular price signal I'm talking about is the rate of interest.

I don't think is true whatsoever.  I think banks will in fact use centralized services for low cost transfers.  They can do this today. 
Bitcoin is NOT low cost transfer mechanism.  There is a bunch of proof-of-work that has to be done which is not required with centralized services.  Today, it may seem low cost compared to the industry standard, but the industry will come up with centralized transfer solutions that are way, way cheaper than Bitcoin.
Bitcoin's entire value proposition is decentralization.

OTOH, the pragmatist, like myself, acknowledges that the best security practices are evolved, not known in advance, that there are tradeoffs involved with all rules, and that yes, there have to be failures for the ecosystem to learn and get stronger.

He's just plain wrong though.  He wants to "burn the [financial] system down" but wants to work with regulators.  Who does he think the regulators represent?
Really, the only advantage of Bitcoin over other systems is that it's decentralized.  A centralized digital cash system would be millions (billions?) of times faster and cheaper.  The whole reason we have all these miners spend millions of dollars creating hashes is to keep things decentralized.
If he really just wants cheaper remittances, he should fund a centralized system and see how many people line up to use it.
@_date: 2015-03-09 17:30:31


I don't think this is true.  Businesses and investments that don't pan out destroy capital.  That capital could be used for businesses and investments that thrive.  Instead the economy will have to wait longer for them to be funded.
So there's always a tension in the economy between spending/investing now vs investing later.  Too much spending/investing now hurts an economy.  The relative proportion of capital allocated to each  (now vs later) determines the overall rate of interest in an economy.

You know how it's pretty hard for the average joe to obtain bitcoins and properly secure them?  It's gotten easier, but most people don't know about private keys and paper wallets.  They don't want to go through the hassle.
Imagine instead that you buy up a bunch of bitcoins.  And you have some friends who are average joes.  They are intrigued by Bitcoin but don't want the hassle.  So you tell them, "Okay, I have a bunch of bitcoins.  You can buy a 'share' of my bunch of bitcoins.  If the price of bitcoins goes up, obviously the value of that share goes up.  That way you get exposure to the upside of bitcoins without having to worry about private keys and paper wallets."
That's what an exchange-traded fund is.  You can buy and sell shares of a company that owns a bunch of _____, which in this case is bitcoins.  
Why is this important for the ecosystem?
* It allows non-technical people to speculate on the price.  
* Depending on what type of fund it is, if the demand for buying shares within the ETF goes up, the company that has created the ETF will have to buy more bitcoins on the open market to meet demand.
* Since it's 'regulated' by the same people who regulate stocks and other funds, people on Wall Street might feel more comfortable buying into this fund rather than bitcoins themselves from some exchange half-way around the world.
So how do you buy a share?  You go to your Etrade account and look up the symbol GBTC.

But lots of non-communist places had trade restrictions and CIA meddling--Iran, parts of South America, quite a bit of "influence" in India, etc.  None of those places resulted in the mass starvation and human liquidation as communist countries.  There was something unique about communism.  
Further, just as the US was trying to harm those communist countries, the USSR was trying to help them at the same time.  
The experiments in communism were imperfect but still very meaningful.  But, for the sake of argument, let's assume for the sake of argument that the communist experiments of the 20th century were indeed flawed beyond being able to draw conclusions from them.  What do you think about the incentives problem and knowledge problem of communism that economics has since raised?

Of course, but I'll also assume you're a young kid and not familiar with how the economy works.  You'll note that there's a thing called opportunity cost.  When you invest in one thing, it means there's another thing you can't invest in.  So investing in a business that fails means you can't invest in a business that succeeds.  So it's better if in an economy, we don't have too much investment, because when we do, more capital will be wasted.
Based on your comments, you seem to think that I believe you can know in advance which businesses will succeed and which ones do not.  That's not what I'm saying.  
All I'm saying is that "more investment = more innovation" is too simplistic.  Wouldn't you agree that problem that led to 2008 was that too many people invested in homes?  And that too many people on Wall Street invested in mortgage backed securities?  
Or that leading up to 2000, too many people invested into dot-coms, of which really only 4 survived (Yahoo, Amazon, Ebay, and Priceline)?  
And that when people over-invest or invest in the wrong stuff, the resulting loss of capital and liquidation of assets results in job losses and lower GDP?  I prefer to minimize recessions when possible.
You see, the current monetary system in which interest rates are artificially set low and inflation is targeted at 2% creates speculators out of all of us.  That's not good for an economy.

One other comment: luckily Bitcoin's success doesn't depend on PR.  
Most people don't think critically.  They go along with whatever everyone else is doing: their friends, their family, neighbors, celebrities, etc.  The way Bitcoin will eventually get to the mainstream is via the margin.
Right now, it is held by people who "get it" and have bought it for speculation and support the ecosystem through coding, building companies, etc.  They are the fringe early adopters.  With each small "quantum" of success, a few more people get in.  Their slightly-less fringe friends and neighbors see this and they decide to take the plunge.  *Their* even less fringe family members get in.  Etc.  
By the time the people who think Bitcoin is all about drug dealers get involved, the price will be 1000x as high and the ecosystem will be by magnitudes more robust and user-friendly.  Luckily, Bitcoin's success doesn't depend on their current opinions.

Let's talk in dollar terms since that's easier.  I make $100K/year.  I save $30K after year one.  I could spend it.  Or I could save it.  Or I could invest it.  I decide to save.  I hope to start a business one day, but I need $300K in capital to do that. 
If I spend right now, or invest right now, I can't start that business.  I have to save for 10 years to invest that money.  Criticizing me for not spending is wrong because me spending the money today hurts the economy long term.
Granted, there may be other investments that don't require $300K and maybe only require $60K in which case I only need to save for 2 years.  But the point is, saving is fundamental to investment.  If everyone spent their money, there would be no investment.  If everyone invested after only a small amount of money was saved, big projects couldn't be invested into.  


When I say "nobody does that" I meant that nobody saves without planning to spend/invest some time down the line.  Otherwise they could just as easily throw the money away if they never plan to use it.

2) I don't worry about perception.  Perception is a problem for businesses and marketers, not for speculative assets.

In an emotional lapse, it would be better if I didn't have access.  
But again, that's not the issue.  The Drug War is not simply some guy in a laboratory somewhere flipping a switch that makes drugs disappear.  It's a War.  A real one.  There is violence, death, murder, and collateral damage.
The majority of violence crime in America exists because drugs are illegal.  Same with Mexico.  Around the world, hundreds of thousands of deaths are a result of the Drug War.  This violence would disappear overnight if drugs were legalized.
In addition, the Drug War has created police that wear paramilitary gear and periodically barge into people's homes and start shooting.  
Not only that, but the Drug War has justified civil asset forfeiture in which merely the suspicion of drugs allows the cops to take your shit.  It's a pretext for legalized theft.  
So yes, it would be great if someone snapped their fingers and drugs disappeared into thin air, but in the real world, the way this is attempted is via cops, guns, and armies.  That solution is waaaaay worse than people actually doing drugs, which is a tragedy no doubt.

You're absolutely right.  People are trying to fit Bitcoin into a box that corresponds to something analagous in the pre-Bitcoin world.  It would be like someone in 1991 looking at the internet as a replacement for mail.  Bitcoin is not simply a currency.  That's one thing it might be someday.  And yes, today, it's a pretty terrible currency.  But it's so much more than a box labeled "currency".
@_date: 2015-02-09 01:26:00
Excellent question.  I'm going to rephrase it a bit, and hopefully, you'll agree that it's a fair retort:  
Assume rich, powerful, 'evil' actors.  In which system do they have more power: DDF's system of protection companies and arbitration companies working for profit or the current system?
I submit that the rich, powerful, and evil have much more power in the current system.  A small minority can have a massive influence because they have incentives to use the govt apparatus to benefit themselves because the benefits are focused on them, but the rest of us don't have the incentive to fight back because the costs are dispersed.  Example: a tariff can yield a corporation $1 million by raising the costs of 1,000,000 T-shirts by $1.  I have no reason to fight this tariff because I only save $1 on the T-shirt I'm going to buy.
Because currently, law is a public good, not a private good.  
By "public good", I mean the economics sense of the term: a good which is non-rivalrous and non-excludable.  When applied to law, this means that a small of money can be used to buy influence that affects *everyone*, not just the person buying that influence.  On the other hand, in a market for law that DDF describes, law is a private good: it's much hard to influence *everyone* else.  This is counter-intuitive, I agree.  Here's a more thorough explanation in the chapter "The Right Side of the Public Goods Trap" (not sure if this link will work).

I think the key is that war has to be costly relative to peace.  
Think back to hundreds of years ago.  In that day, war could be profitable.  If you could wield greater force than the opposition, you could take over their homes and possessions and you'd be richer than before the war.  War was an investment that frequently paid off.
That is still the case today in some parts of the world, but in Western 1st world nations, that is clearly not the case.  War is costly.  If England went to war with France, let's say, England might well win, but they'd be worse off than before the war.  Why?  Because the wealth-generating force within England is technology, manufacturing, services, etc, and those things are stronger than any wealth that could be generated from winning a war with France.  I submit that war between England and France will not happen for the next thousand years despite the fact that they were in a constant state of war over most of the previous thousand years.
The next question is, "If peace is more profitable than war, does that remain true as the number of countries increases?"  That's a much more difficult question to answer.  Will there will be peace at 200,000 countries?  Who knows?  
My intuition, and it's only that, tells me that as the world gets richer, there is much more to lose with making war, and therefore, the world will be able to support a larger number of countries.  But that's just conjecture.

No.  Cash = settlement. 
The whole argument of the White Paper is that trusted third parties are security holes, not just against the usual thieves, but also central banks, arguably the biggest thieves of all.  The aim of Bitcoin is to get rid of trusted third parties, and therefore, create cash on the internet, i.e., a *settlement* system which is by definition, peer-to-peer.

Keep in mind that the world at large is without a central set of laws.  Countries exist independently for the most part.  Granted, there are lots of wars, but if you look at certain parts of the world like 1st world Western countries, wars between them are fairly rare.  I don't think anyone would argue that we need one single world govt.  That would be a terrible solution.  At least with hundreds of countries, laws can evolve, and countries can learn from the experiences of other countries.

Centralized currencies for exchange-use can be built on top of Bitcoin.  No need for coffee purchases to be decentralized.
Of course, Lightning network is trust-minimized, and my preferred solution for exchange-use.  But my point stands: the biggest value proposition is store-of-value.
Plenty of exchange-currencies (USD, CNY, etc) and exchange systems (VISA, Paypal) exist.  That's not anything new in the world.  Or rare in the world.  
Impeachable store-of-value that can be sent over the internet is rare.  That's the breakthrough.

I think you misunderstood Krugman's "Bitcoin is evil" article, which is understandable because it was written in a very roundabout way.  It wasn't merely a title to get attention.  He expounded on how it was evil in the content of the article.  This is that part:
"But as I said, this is a positive discussion. What about the normative economics? Well, you should read Charlie Stross:
 ----BitCoin looks like it was designed as a weapon intended to damage central banking and money issuing banks, with a Libertarian political agenda in mind—to damage states ability to collect tax and monitor their citizens financial transactions.----
Go read the whole thing.
Stross doesn’t like that agenda, and neither do I..."

Not a joke.  The point was to separate what is (positive) from what should be (normative).  The first part of the column is about whether or not Bitcoin works/ will work/ etc--the positive part.
The second part is the normative: it results in things libertarians desire.  This, Krugman concludes, is evil.  But, he says, whether it's evil or not should have no bearing on whether or not it will work.
Note, however, that he does in fact think it's evil.
