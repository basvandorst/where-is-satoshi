I would love if the offline device holding the keys could be android. Even easier to carry around/secure, and I've got so many old phones laying around.
@_date: 2012-11-29 21:02:57
Ooh, that makes sense. Cool solution!
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:33:51
No harm in asking. Sooner the better.

Not "backed" in the same way as a currency based on (for example) gold, though. That computing isn't doing anything that a person not invested in the currency considers useful or valuable.
If it were, you could buy time on this supercomputer and use it for whatever you wanted.
What you're saying is kind of like saying that USD is backed by the credit card processors.

Me too please!

I think you mean "sarcasm", not "irony".

Same, promised Thursday 7pm CST.
It baffles me how their wallet functionality is so shit though, even removing the coins I did have in there took 24 hours. Every single other wallet I've used at least shows activity for the recipient within 2-3 minutes.

Or just... upgrade?
@_date: 2013-04-10 02:31:44
It wouldn't make sense to do it all at once.
@_date: 2013-03-24 19:19:42
So... this is just another tumbler? Why are they talking about it like it's hot shit?
@_date: 2013-02-11 20:26:39
Food, rent, gas (gas gift cards?). Basically daily essentials.

Per account.

I was able to buy some BTC with a new coinbase account in about five minutes thanks to instant bank verification. As for them actually giving them to me, well.... 72 hours and counting.

Still pending on an order placed Monday and due yesterday. Already promised to someone on localbitcoins who's getting annoyed. Fuck this.
@_date: 2013-03-23 16:43:00
I'm sure you aware, but even if you do manage to purchase on coinbase good luck actually getting the coins. They've had my money for 5 days and coins were promised to me Thursday night. Still "pending".
@_date: 2013-03-27 19:24:44
It was someone buying way above ask for some reason.

Bitcoin is a really interesting hybrid model of a currency and a (simulated) precious metal. Comparing it to market cap of a corporation doesn't make much sense, though. Everyone who owns gold has a "stake" in the amount of gold in the world, but that doesn't mean anything. Having a lot of USD doesn't give you a higher stake in the running of the government (it does in real terms, of course, but not in literal terms).
@_date: 2013-04-01 18:20:00
My exact reaction. And if you are making this comparison, why list some of the biggest companies in the world instead of some that are ~1B market cap?
@_date: 2013-04-09 14:48:06
Dat days destroyed
@_date: 2013-04-03 22:07:10
Bitpay is a good stand-in.
@_date: 2013-03-22 17:43:12
Laymen won't care about mining though. Even in explaining the concept to my CS-oriented roommate, he was confused by the relationship between bitcoin mining and transactions at first - thinking the recent price changes were mostly driven by miners.
Many people just need to know enough to know how their credit card works, not how the entire credit card processing industry works. If they want to know more, they'll dig.
@_date: 2013-03-21 20:02:35
So, what's *your* strategy at the moment?
@_date: 2013-03-28 21:08:06
@_date: 2013-03-28 20:42:33
It's a case of letting investment banks play with commercial bank money.
@_date: 2013-04-09 13:57:32
Yeah, somebody had to make the first purchase...
