Thank you!

Will do! I was doing x11 on trade
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:55:13
Supply any links?? Would appreciate it!
@_date: 2014-05-29 17:20:55
i have 1 270 right now 
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:07:07
how would i do that? i never heard of that algorithm 
@_date: 2014-05-29 16:22:53
Thanks bud! I really appreciate all the help you're giving me!
@_date: 2014-05-28 18:53:57
So i have set an account and everything going and it seems to say 
(low difficulty share of x) x = Number
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:54:38
I mine myself. I have nothing to lose at this point. It doesn't hurt to start off small!
@_date: 2014-05-28 13:49:26
Could you supply a link and this SHA-256 or Scrypt?
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:50:51
so just change to x13?
@_date: 2014-05-29 15:38:16
Do i set it up like the same way as X11 and could i still use my GPU or is it just CPU?
@_date: 2014-05-29 13:20:33
so config x13 im guessing??? I just saw it
@_date: 2014-05-28 14:12:57
1. Yes
2. There are fees when transferring coins to and from
3. Depends on Hardware you are using and what pool you join.
P.S. try to get asics for hardware for Bitcoins but for Litecoin and others get GPUs
@_date: 2014-05-29 23:21:30
That would help!
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:57:51
I will look into it. Could i have your payment address so i could tip you later on??
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:07:29
Thanks! Will look into it
@_date: 2014-05-28 17:25:24
So get sgminer for the software and what pool/coin do i mine?
@_date: 2014-05-28 21:19:56
i got the trademybit to work! Thank you and i will give you a satisfying tip when i get the amount! Thanks again!
@_date: 2014-05-29 19:03:24
