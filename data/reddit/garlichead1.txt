you can have sex with robots, so yes, that should also be possible
@_date: 2018-01-01 11:40:23
are they really called SS agents? sounds ww2ish
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:07:11
most bitcoin holders are not millionaires
@_date: 2018-01-10 16:14:29
sometimes i have money in my rl wallet, yes
@_date: 2019-07-30 06:20:46
just connect it with the fuse
@_date: 2019-07-09 06:35:27
i for myself have (had) 30 wallets at least
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:05:56
i wanted to order a pizza 2 days ago. i had to pay 3€ transaction fees on top of price of pizza.
@_date: 2019-07-01 07:08:39
i bought nearly on top when it first hit 1000, was in the red for over 2 years.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:40:06
so basically just fuck reddit and move on? or talk about what annoys you? 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:13:56
don't they sell btc too? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:36:26
so for example a company could pay all his employees salaries through LN, in addition all employees can make payments with each others and none of those transactions would be visible on the blockchain? 
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:13:40
am austrian, what's that? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 14:30:13
this is actually good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:06:51
i wouldn't call it an attack
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:03:59
In 728 minutes
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:10:26
so bad it doesn't even open for me
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:37:35
i am not from any sub. it just annoys me because i frequent r/bitcoin on a daily basis
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:03:21
9 of top 11 post are fucking memes. i hate this sub so much!
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:51:51
there a few upcoming
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:09:22
i am rich
I know that LN will solve it all for us.
LN networks are going to work.
i understand bitcoin and did some research.
If we had 8MB blocks, we would still fill them up
i mean, there is no information, just your faith.
@_date: 2017-12-17 08:25:58
such currency
@_date: 2017-12-12 08:55:08
i still have some .2 btc at bter.com
anyone knows how i can withdraw them? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:37:56
is it possible that fees will be higher in the future? how are they calculated? 
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:52:15
sounds much too religious for me
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:21:12
much doge
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:09:41
fuck people telling us again and again that it´s an attack.
high transaction volume isn´t an attack
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:51:11
no, go away!
@_date: 2017-12-12 09:44:09
let me think about it. first up then down, up again and down. maybe up again. 
@_date: 2017-12-31 18:54:02
so it´s technically a lie if people say just send to a segwit address and you´ll pay lower fees which i have seen here several times.
@_date: 2017-12-21 07:52:38
attack? what attack? 
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:42:45
pretty good.
bitcoin tweets say "invalid date" for me
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:50:25
if you research the blockchain technology then it's no longer a bet
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:42:41
then do 4mb blocks, whatever. just telling us LN will come and everything will be fine is just pathetic
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:22:16
why TF do you have to buy her an ipad. just buy a samsung tablet for half the price
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:01:11
better waiting for LN to solve all problems?
btc is practically unuseable and there is no plan B
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:38:49
i like the two non-memes. if you like them.... go ahead liking them
@_date: 2017-12-24 13:24:32
you were drunk too? 
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:09:11
bit we don't know when some or how many are lost. how should the users price it in? 
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:31:27
we did it reddit!
@_date: 2017-12-26 16:01:37
ELI5 what is batching? 
@_date: 2017-12-24 20:43:15
you expect? why do you expect it? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:13:13
i cashed ou 25% 3 days ago. no regrets. it can come down anytime. never sell everything, try to diversivy. 
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:19:33
stop whining loser. those are not attacks. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:48:36
if it really "takes over" then people's salaries would simply be paid in bitcoin, so you would earn them.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:23:54
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:50:50
is there a plan to raise the blocksize limit in the near future? LN seems to be plan A, what about plan B? 
@_date: 2018-08-19 09:58:19
@_date: 2018-08-26 05:43:58
what an unbelieveable shitty meme
@_date: 2018-05-21 07:40:24
this is actually good for bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:38:13

created after the hard spoon
@_date: 2017-02-05 09:36:17
why did bitcoin start behind ltc and the others? 
@_date: 2017-02-12 13:49:27
that´s good news for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-02 16:42:27
indeed, being high was never a problem. but when you come down... 
@_date: 2017-02-27 23:42:47
you must have many friends

@_date: 2017-08-30 07:07:47
i thought this was 80 years ago
@_date: 2017-08-07 15:27:37
yeah but in one year it won't matter if they bought at ath
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:43:04
that's actually good for bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-15 16:50:16
how long does it take if you pay with visa until it is actually on the vendor's bankroll?

@_date: 2019-02-11 18:35:22
have to have a reddit account for owning bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 09:12:33

@_date: 2017-11-23 13:27:29
What a shitpost
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:22:00

@_date: 2017-11-10 12:48:21
i have my btc on a paper wallet. can i just send them to an exchange and receive my bch and send btc back to a paper wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-15 16:19:30
i sold mine yesterday on bitcoin.de
sent btc from paper wallet to my trezor, then sent bch to bitcoin.de and sold it there.
keeping the paper wallet for bitcoin gold (maybe)
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:51:42
who the fuck cares...?
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:58:14
Out of the loop? 9000?
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:52:04

mining cartel who wants to destroy bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:10:59
maybe, don´t trust anything you read on the internet (without researching)
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:50:51
you have to decide, do you want to be a 1) trader or a 2) holder?
if 1) then one bad trade is not that bad, you are going to make lots of trades.
if 2) WHY THE HELL DID YOU SELL YOU IDIOT!!!???
@_date: 2017-11-26 12:39:52
What a day the last year was... 
@_date: 2017-11-18 11:01:03
what happens if i sent from a non-segwit to a segwit address? will it arrive?
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:22:27
good week for me. converted all my bch to $ for an important payment. and btc above 7000 again!
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:44:28
i told her at the age of 2, that was two weeks ago
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:16:56
ELI5 please.
when a big hack happens, like mt.gox, would it be technically possible, with a consenus of miners, that these stolen coins can never reach the new wallet(s)?
@_date: 2017-04-04 08:34:44
opinions of rich people would be visible
@_date: 2017-11-16 07:30:39
even if it goes up i don't mind because i also could have sold at 300
@_date: 2018-03-25 09:21:31
i only sold fractions of my bitcoins bought in 2013. it's all or nothing
@_date: 2019-01-03 14:32:19
so price of a bike now?
@_date: 2019-01-24 16:34:48
i mean... there is... 
@_date: 2017-09-02 08:45:33
something like ten times worse? 
@_date: 2017-09-02 19:43:59
you would become a legend if it actually happens
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:35:26
the comments are always in the comments
@_date: 2017-10-14 09:39:55
that's why i keep it on a paper wallet. ia m way too lazy to cash it out
@_date: 2017-09-17 08:52:34
keep it on a paper wallet. i am way too lazy to sell since then
@_date: 2018-07-07 10:45:09
theoreticallay it can because you can print indefinitely amount of $
@_date: 2018-07-16 18:18:37
@_date: 2018-02-17 20:52:49
i bought in 2013, put it on a paper wallet and was waaaay to lazy to do anything with it.
when bcash came along, i transferred it to trezor and sold bcash.
@_date: 2018-07-03 09:01:55
i invested almost 30k sounds like you invested 28k
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:21:00
from a neutral point of view you are the moron
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:41:41
btc vs bch is why i left this sub
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:17:44
he is active on google now? 
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:25:42
wtf? he showed great effort, built a useful site which only 1% of people can do and you behave like an idiot
@_date: 2018-04-29 08:16:59
