Haha yep. No one to blame. Never even thought about the possibility of it skyrocketing. As I remember, it was only worth 50 something dollars back then.

I've definitely tricked myself a couple times hahah. A cryptic text file is what I was thinking. It's a definite possibility and probably my only hope.

I don't think blockchain existed back then. It doesn't ring a bell, but I definitely remember mtgox. I don't recall how I bought the BTC though. It may have been through an individual trader.

I can't remember how it works exactly but did you necessarily need a wallet.dat file? I feel like I just logged in somewhere.... I don't think I used a client.

OK so you just fucking reminded me that I have 30 btc from years ago, but I have NO fucking clue how to access it now. I don't even remember how wallets and all that shit works and I'm certain I used some random ass login info. 
$24,000 that I have no access to. What in the fuck.

I wish I could remember how I accessed it, but I'm sure I used a method that left no trace on my computer. I recall having to login on the web, rather than download and use a client... but this was a couple years ago so I could be wrong. I pulled my laptop out, but it's in disarray so I need to either fix it or just yank the HD out.
Although... I but I could boot it in Target Disk Mode onto my PC with a little work. I'm gonna try that.

I think I made a throwaway email for it that I can't remember at all. I'm just crossing my fingers that I have something, anything on that HD.
This is getting comical.

It's not that crazy.. 34 bitcoins wasn't much a couple years ago.
@_date: 2013-11-25 07:54:33
Yea I definitely didn't store anything on my computer. I wonder if there is something, anything, though.

I don't know what you mean by 'on the hard drive'. I was being very anonymous/secure about all of it, anyway. I don't remember how to access/where to access my wallet and on top of that I probably used a hushmail account I can't remember with a password I also can't remember.
