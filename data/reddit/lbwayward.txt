The ability of savers to invest (in start-up businesses, someone else's education, ect)  is a good thing though right? Would a economy based on BitCoin not encourage these things? (serious questions)

It's still not clear (legally) if bitcoin is money.

This isn't a my currency-is-beter-then-your-currency kind of thing. 
It's a sober analysis of what is happening to BitCoin and what is holding it back.

I think that they got the core of it just right. BitCoin is on a bubble, is dominated by speculation, and isn't a stable store of value. Those things are keeping actual users away. Spot on.

Bubble time.

I think this might be a "I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it" kind of thing. And that's ok.

Show them being crony-capitalist.

Although I would like to see the counter argument that because the prosecutor was paid in USD, he also had a conflict of intrest.

because a skillful and benevolent hand can use monetary policy for good. So if you believe that the guy with his hand on the konb is skillful and accountable, a fiat currency is better then a currency that can't be used as a policy tool.

Not really. There was a huge spike as the bubble poped, but the lead up to the bubble and the peak of bubble had ratios that were very close to the current levels. 
An ignorant question: is a "high trade volume" a measure of the amount of money trading hands or the number of trades being made?  Does a large number of micro-transactions measure as a "high trade volume"?

If it's a bubble then this price change is temporary; if it's growing pains, then this price change is more or less permanent. Those aren't different names for the same thing.

What about multiple parallel crypto currencies? There could be one for each major metro area, a few regional ones and one global one. by spiting the mining across multiple currencies you can stretch the hard limit and decrease the fee.

A sophisticated economy needs a stable monetary system. In practice, there is no alternative to a central bank backed fiat currency for stability. Maybe BitCoin will grow in to one, but today it isn't. 
BTW is that(support central banking) all that you meant by crony-capitalist? Because that term is usually used a lot more broadly.

These bubbles are not good for the legitimacy of BTC.
