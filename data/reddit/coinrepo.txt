a private investor or you just own some of their stock?

it seems like it would do much better if you just included a timestamp in the utip spec.

but the memo is said to feel like natural speech, if you look at Venmo's payment stream you'll find that people often make multiple payments with the same description, i.e. without care for uniqueness

how can I transfer money between wallets without paying any fees? is this even possible? what software do I need to get or can I use blockchain.info to do it?

how does it prevent asking someone for money multiple times?
suppose I write |+utip ...| on a blog post, blog.com/2013/5/9/post but then someone accesses blog.com (and sees the post) and then accesses blog.com/2013/5/9/post and sees the same utip. Won't their browser query the user twice for payment?

part of the tipstring, it doesn't matter if tippers lie because it's against their incentive. but yeah would make it harder for them without a plugin.
relying on a plugin seems pretty decent, since they'll need some client to confirm the bitcointips anyways

check the wired.com site, it uses max-age=0 so this is pretty moot.

are you kidding me?
everyone uses pageviews to gauge content popularity. Even with standard caching in place, the server still knows which pages you're requesting.

suppose you use internet at a random coffee shop. The owner could inject an iframe to carbonwallet into an http pageview you do. the carbonwallet that is loaded could also be fake and furthermore, they could use html5 cache to make it persist offline (until you regain access to a safe network)

do you even work in tech?


in general, this is of course impossible, as it would fail over HTTPS. but even over HTTP this idea fails without the site and ISP collaborating. And why would a site give up precious metrics on something so small as an HTML page load?

he's only locked away like 2BTC? Satoshi has locked away way more than that..
