Most bitcoins have never been taken out of their original wallet, so yea, BTC does suffer from this problem in a macro sense.

Read your history books, it was horrible for the poor. That's what caused the people's party, that's what caused the Democratic party to elect the silver candidate who would not be crucified on a cross of Gold, William Jennings Bryan. It was THE major political issue of the time, and you assert it wasn't that bad?... That's an absurd revisionist history if I ever heard one.

So, most of the time, then, it's probably substantially less than the 6% number you quoted? Meaning, it might not beat inflation?
Also, you're right, that is usually a property manager. That was my bad.

The vast majority of America did not experience growth during this era, it was only the small, wealthy few who did. The disparity would not only lead to the populist movement at the end of the 19th century, but to the movements that were lead by people like Huey Long even before the Depression has started.
There were large disparities of the effects of wealth in this time period, and disparities render per capita income as a meaningless metric of overall well being, which is why we have to resort to proxies for that metric (like the foundation of a powerful political movement). Furthermore, most of these benefits did finally trickle outwards to the people only after legislation forced them to do so--Teddy Roosevelt was a major player, both as legislator and governor of New York and as President in helping these benefits go out to the people, rather than being held by the wealthy few.
That history is simply incorrect.

Well, you can find it on the blockchain. I can't find the original calculations, but here's a guy who calculated the velocity of BTC at a very low value:
Here's another one, a bit older, that shows that the number is around 78%:
BDD is an upper bound on the number of bitcoins traded, and it's quite low even over a long time scale, which shows that while some wallets are active, most are not.

Landlords aren't necessarily owners in most of the world. Most of the time they are administration and maintenance for a property owned by another party, making your comment even more unclear. Do you mean income from rents on a property that one owns and administers? Do you mean income above maintenance and administrative costs? Do you mean income, without factoring in maintenance and administration? If you don't mean appreciation of the value of the land, then what do you mean?

Public key encryption is basically dead once Quantum Computers start being real. That means bitcoin, too.

Elaborate? Commentor  points out that it's a really shitty implementation anyway (which is very obviously is): "Congratulations, you have made the least secure implementation ever. Even your D-H key exchange has several well known vulnerabilities."
@_date: 2014-04-16 01:16:28
Yeah, but he didn't write the encryption framework himself. He just took available libraries and used them, including: 




The only reason it wasn't affected was that he was probably using an old version of OpenSSL.

Then you're not investing in bitcoins, you're just accepting bitcoins for purchase while also tacitly admitting that they're too volatile for normal business transactions. (That is, they're too volatile without a sufficiently diversified portfolio already. While MPT would certainly recommend bitcoin to diversity the already extremely diversified investor, as they are an almost entirely uncorrelated asset, no arbitrary merchant has that luxury.)
And, the additional cost of another purchasing processor would almost certainly recommend against this switch, especially given the very small size of the potential market.

It's clear what the headline means to me, but it is awkwardly worded.  It should have been: 'Bitcoin exchange founder'

I wonder how they do it for other currencies, I wonder if they have to buy them on the market, or if they have a bank agreement to convert it before depositing it automatically.  It's actually a pretty interesting question.  I don't know the answer.
@_date: 2013-11-28 08:59:53
Uhm, no. He never explained it. How would the returns be spectacular? Only someone without a keen grasp of history could say that. With a deflationary currency, people wouldn't be able to repay their debts. That's what always happens with a deflationary currency.

Do you know what actually happened when Lehman Brothers collapsed? The problem was largely a counterparty problem, do you know what that means? If you don't, then I suggest you read a lot more about what caused the crisis, because if you knew anything about it, you'd know deregulation is not the answer.

Let's look at how many of these statements are wrong. You're wrong about most of the people who work at these firms, that's so bizarre a claim and so obviously wrong. Most of the people working there aren't lawyers. In fact, there is a shortage of lawyers for exactly the positions you are discussing. It's a further absurdity because the banks hire outside law firms to do almost all of their litigation, Skadden, etc all do this kind of thing. Don't be silly in thinking that they are all lawyers. They are all kinds of people: there are traders, M&amp;A, there are so many roles there that I can't even list them all. Why would most of the people working there even be lawyers? How are they making money if they are all lawyers? That's just so wrong.
Let's move on. 


This is only kind of true. Most small banks are in compliance with all of these automatically, most of these are created entirely to regulate large banks. Smaller banks don't have most of the complications that make the rules complex.


I never advocated more regulation. Actually I never advocated anything of the sort. I just stated that the reason for the collapse is largely because of [counterparties]( This is pretty much true, if you know anything about what happened, naked counterparty risk is still a massive problem in banking. What would dereguation do about that? Do you know what those things are? Have you ever, per chance, heard of [Long Term Capital Management]( I'd suggest reading into them.


Why are there any small banks? There's a lot of them, and most of them are pretty profitable. I mean, this is just a patently false statement. But you can live in your fantasy world if you wish. I know the owners of some small banks, and it's a very good source of income for them. Hmmm... These claims are getting weirder and weirder.


This is actually incorrect. Undisclosed counterparty risk caused the Too Big to Fail concept. One big enough bank going down will take the rest down because it is actually a trading partner to every other bank, and owes all of them money. So, it's like a lynchpin of the system. The problem is that none of these banks know what the other banks are holding! So, they can't know what the exact risk is. So, they can't plan for it!


The market does set interest rates for the vast majority of things. That was the whole idea behind securitized mortgages, which, actually, work pretty well when they are normal mortgages that have money down and the ability to pay and such. Will you prevent mortgages from being securitized with regulations? I thought you said that regulations are bad? Or will banks just, go back to that naturally? I really have no idea why they would do that, splitting risk across a wider number of partners seems like a better idea, usually, than not splitting them. And, since I suppose you oppose disclosure requirements, no one will ever know what they're investing in! Whoopeee! It's back to 2006 all over again! Yay!


Without deposit insurance, I'm not sure I'd put money in the bank. Frankly, it's not wise to do so, especially with privately held banks who don't disclose risk to you! Oh. Would you regulate them to make them disclose risk? Or would you just allow them to fool people into thinking that their money is safe, like they did before 1933? What's your plan for this?
The bottom line is, you have no idea how banking works and little idea what you're talking about. Don't spout nonsense. If you want to live in your idealized economic world, fine, but you should accept that it's not reality.

Given the liquidity of BTC markets, I'd think they would have to do processing through cash reserves and then put them on the open market.  And, given the historic liquidity issues of BTC, I'd think that they would have to lay all this out at the beginning.  However, I have no idea.  Are you getting this from their merchant agreement?  Do you have a link to it?  I'm really curious about it.

No, you're not following. My claim was this: if bitcoin is deflationary, then it is never rational to lend it out. Returns would not be more spectacular than just holding the btc because people would default all the time. I'm not sure what I'm not following... I think that's all pretty clear.
@_date: 2013-11-28 06:55:11
You misunderstand the issue. Why would lend it if the returns are so spectacular?

Why would he borrow when he could borrow at a far more favorable rate in dollars and then change it into bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-04-26 02:15:50
How does it automatically convert them?  Does it buy them from the seller in USD, and then sell them on the open market?  Where does it get the price for BTC from?
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:55:15
(Borrowing rates across currencies are almost never aligned like that.) But, if we pretend that they are, then your argument is that there is no monetary advantage to be gained by lending in BTC over lending in dollars.
