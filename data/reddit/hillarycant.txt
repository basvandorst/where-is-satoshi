That's not accurate, you can withdraw freely in CNY, what they can't do is to withdraw in BTC. I think they will go back no normal (allowing BTC withdrawals) soon, after they assess the effects of their implementations.

Japan's Government officially declaring Bitcoin as payment starting tomorrow. This is huge and a few years ago, a major Government doing this would be front page with hundreds of votes.

No, the drop is just one big fund selling (GABI).
Edit: They just want to be on the safe side, but they did acknowledge that if the ETF is approved, they will be missing big on the price spike but they will continue buying if approved. IMO, they will lose the bet:

Not when they don't have any technical knowledge (as he has shown on the interviews) and is pushing for technical changes that will damage Bitcoin. Bitcoin does NOT need a harfork. It can get everything it needs (scaling, privacy, smart contracts, etc) on layers on top of the IMMUTABLE blockchain (main and most important Bitcoin's attribute). Just like the Internet evolved, even when more 'efficient' protocols existed to replace the initial protocol, it was already too late and all solutions were built on top of it.

Wrong logic. If the limit is raised they need to print more money, dollar value gets diluted, that's inflation. Bitcoin is the opposite: limited and decreasing supply over time (deflationary). So dollar value goes down, Bitcoin value goes up: You need more dollars to buy one bitcoin.

No way, not even China could drop the price by halting bitcoin withdrawals on all Chinese exchanges. There will be a panic sell from weak hands and speculators, but not more than around $100 drop.

You are wrong, the price is locked at the time you buy, it does not matter if bitcoin goes up or down in the time between you buy and the coins are accredited to your account.
Also, (not very related with your post) general advice:

It is always a good time to buy bitcoin if you are holding long term and not just for day trading. Don't wait for the price to drop significantly again, because you could be waiting forever:

Bitcoin is doing better than ever in almost every area. What you see as "huge problems" are nothing but FUD pushed mainly by just 2 individuals: Jihad Wu and Roger Ver. 
They have deep pockets+mining power and are trying to control Bitcoin, but nobody can control a decentralized system, they failed again as it happened with Bitcoin XT, Bitcoin Classic, etc. 
They will keep failing: Bitcoin WILL NOT HARD-FORK as they want, nobody can make that happen just like nobody could change the internet protocol in the 90's when other "better alternatives" surged, it was already too late and all of the development and improvements were made on layers on top of it. 
And that's exactly what will happen to Bitcoin, all needed improvements (scaling, privacy, smart contracts, etc) will be done (and are being developed right now) on layers on top of Bitcoin (SegWit, Lighting Network, Mimblewimble, etc).
