No he isn't, it happens all the time. Just like people screaming about how Bitcoin has "No fees!"
@_date: 2015-06-20 20:36:41
Yes, massive publicity that Bitcoins are mainly used for drugs. But hey, all publicity is good amirite?
@_date: 2015-06-19 00:45:01
Dont worry guys just let the free market sort it out
@_date: 2015-06-19 19:42:38
To a bank or mastercard, 300k/day is like pulling a nickel out of your pocket.
@_date: 2015-06-22 21:53:08
SOMETHING SOMETHING rational actors SOMETHING free market SOMETHING

Once the price starts rising, why would I spend more versus sitting and letting it become more valuable?
@_date: 2015-06-21 03:50:35
No proof of that, we can't even make a solid decision now
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:03:27
LMAO the people in this thread suddenly turning against Antonopoulos because he said that the Greek crisis circle jerk isn't what this sub imagined it is.
@_date: 2015-06-15 00:07:50
And suddenly people are learning why deflationary currencies don't work.
@_date: 2015-06-15 00:11:30
Oh good, another person who plays the "ugh I was totally about to spend BTC there but no more! For serials." card.
@_date: 2015-06-18 03:07:07
And why would people spend Bitcoin if its value increases? Its better for me to sit on it while value increases instead of spending it.
@_date: 2015-06-30 15:56:46
whooooooooo were rich!
@_date: 2015-06-15 00:08:25
why not?
@_date: 2015-06-12 20:28:48
You should have posted this as @_date: 2015-06-19 19:42:00
Oh so what your saying is banks aren't actually afraid of Bitcoin because they could destroy it just as easily with 300k a day? Whodathunk.
@_date: 2015-06-19 05:17:07
yea and the network grinds to a standstill 
@_date: 2015-06-18 06:17:58
Is that trading volume indicating people buying bitcoin or using it to purchase things during a price rise? Because if its people buying bitcoin and not spending it, my point stands.
@_date: 2015-06-21 16:28:19
Didn't you learn anything from last time from posting on your shill alt  ?
Also lets remember how the price skyrocketed during the last halving. Oh wait, it didn't move at all.
@_date: 2015-05-25 23:58:13
grubhub isnt the one doing the delivery
@_date: 2015-07-03 03:54:57
Oh good, more Zerohedge trash
@_date: 2015-07-20 04:15:01
If you have one organization spamming transactions to stress test the network for days, you can't really consider that a "record breaking daily transaction" towards increased users.
@_date: 2015-07-11 23:54:32
I think using Bitcoin to propagate the sex slave trade is giving Bitcoin a bad name.
@_date: 2015-07-01 02:42:15
Yea, as opposed to Bitcoiners like who got caught shilling on his alt about why Bitcoin is going to the moon.
@_date: 2015-07-19 23:46:58
Oh, are we done pumping Greece? Must've missed the memo.
@_date: 2015-07-27 18:16:01
Thats a BS argument. The front page is littered with posts about financial collapse, bailouts, and other things that don't even mention the word Bitcoin, but this does because "omg altcoin etherium scam"?
@_date: 2015-07-28 21:20:09
They're all raising their hands, no idea at what. For all we know he could have asked "Who has heard of Bitcoin" and posted this BS pump
@_date: 2015-07-21 02:15:54
Could be worse, he could be a guy like you who argues with "statists" by using pedophilia and CP as an argument. Can't erase that from your post history.
@_date: 2015-07-28 02:30:04
Dont worry the free market will sort all this out!
@_date: 2015-07-28 17:38:03
@_date: 2015-07-19 01:15:57
An upward trend since 1200. Oh wait
