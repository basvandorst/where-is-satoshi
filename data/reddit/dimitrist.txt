The 2nd person to create the same wallet will suddenly realize that there is money in it and can spend it. Or they will realize there are transactions in the wallet with no balance, in which case they can wait for fresh coins to arrive and then spend them. 
The original wallet creator will know nothing about the 2nd wallet, until one day they will see their coins disappearing. 
If you want to play with this, import the phrase “art art art art art art art art art art art able” to see what a shared wallet is like. Steal the coins you will find inside. I left them there on purpose.

You can mention features Bitcoin has but not fiat, e.g.
1) you can store your wealth in 12-word mnemonic seed phrases
2) multisig transactions. E.g. 2-out-of-3 multisig with an escrow agent as used in OpenBazaar
3) nLockTime transactions that only occur in the future
4) fixed money supply

Have your children memorize 12-word Bitcoin mnemonic seeds. They must recite them to you every X months. Or set them up with Cryptosteels and multisig wallets if they are old enough. 
Send BTC to them using nLockTime, so that the transaction(s) can only be executed a few years into the future. Give them these transactions. Back them up in multiple places. They are not secret, you want them to be found and transmitted on the Bitcoin network when the time comes. 
You can destroy the private keys from which you send the BTC if you want these transactions to be irrevocable (so either your children receive these funds or they are lost). This assumes you are sending from single non-HD addresses or that you are sending from an HD wallet with no other funds in it.

Otherwise, look for the transaction ID on blockchain explorers such as [blockstream.info]( It is likely that not many nodes, other than your own (wallet A), know about this transaction.
If you restore your seed in another wallet (wallet B), this new wallet will not know of the transaction and will show you the full balance.
You could create a new, empty wallet (wallet C), and send all your entire balance there (from wallet B), so that you don't have to worry about the old transaction coming back from the dead one day.

Here are some thoughts: did the miner bother to broadcast their transaction? If the transaction made it to the block but not to any mempools that would be suspicious.
If they did bother to broadcast it, did it have a high enough fee? Or was it blatantly chosen over other transactions stealing the same coins in the mempool?
You could actually test this by broadcasting some bait transaction and also some transactions attempting to eat the bait with different fee levels. So if you attempt to steal the bait with 5 sat/byte and you consistently see someone stealing it with 2 sat/byte that might be a miner?

It is a dead man's switch, by definition you have to check on it every X months, otherwise it will trigger. X is configurable between 3 and 18 months. Google sends you reminders before it triggers the switch, in case you forgot to login. You can test it by creating a new account, setting the Inactivity period to 3 months and waiting.

Your friend will also have to pay a fee to spend that $5 in Bitcoin.
Not only that, they can't escape this fee. Say they already had $5 from another transaction and now they have $10. When they attempt to spend that $10, the transaction will be larger in bytes because it will have to refer to both the $5 incoming transactions. Essentially they pay fees for each incoming payment they want to spend.
Imagine a coffee shop receiving lots of $5 payments in Bitcoin. They would have to pay lots of fees to either consolidate or spend all of those $5s.
Having $10 in Bitcoin that you received in a single payment is much better for you compared to having $10 received in multiple payments.
