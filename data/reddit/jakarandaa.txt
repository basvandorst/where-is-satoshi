here also, an interested comment from Eric Voorhees:
"I do not see what's wrong about some private investors going in and trying to buy MtGox, fix it up, and diminish the effect of Gox's calamity. That seems like a good thing to do. Those investors may have been able to cover some of the losses of Gox, but perhaps now, being spooked, they will back off and nothing will be rescued.
And someone who hears negative things about a company ahead of the general public is under no moral obligation to release it into the wild. Indeed, sometimes doing so is highly irresponsible, and can compound the problem and exacerbate the damage done to victims.
Certainly, a million details are unknown about Gox, but I see no value in trying to vilify not only the company responsible (Gox), but also those parties nearby who may have been trying to help."

Hi guys, I'm a newbie here &amp; I've made this little infographic animation based on the MIT report of last week. I hope you'll find this content format useful. (you can find the gif version here 
Feel free to give me your feedbacks or ideas to make another short gif/video about bitcoin. I'll be happy to contribute by producing short visual contents to raise awareness ^^

How do you know that these are mtgox wallets ?
@_date: 2014-02-24 14:24:07
Yep, that makes sense man. Indeed, it could indicate people who daytrade. Concerning the animation, i didn't want to give my own interpretation, I just animated the information from the MIT report =&gt;

It wasn't about making a gift of half billion $ with no return, if was about selling the company which has a high volume trading, a database of 1 million users. These are assets which are difficult to every startup to build.
