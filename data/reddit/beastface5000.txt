Visa also processes upwards of 60 billion transactions per year. How much electricity does it take to process and validate one Bitcoin transaction? Bitcoin currently uses about the same amount of power as Jordan does in an entire year to validate orders of magnitude fewer transactions than visa. It takes 6x's the power of an average US household to verify a transaction. Bitcoin cannot scale to the size of Visa.  No crypto currency can. 
Japan has been swinging between -.4% and about 1% and its central bank loosens money every time it comes back, because lending doesn't work in long periods of deflation because real rates of interest are much higher. Banks only lend during periods of deflation, due to proding by central banks and adoption of negative interest rates.
With Bitcoin there is 0 incentive to adopt a negative interest rate. Ever. Your money will always be worth more in your pocket then it will be lending it especially given its currents bullish run. 
You will never be able to pay your taxes in the US with Bitcoin.

It doesn't replace them.

A) not even remotely true. 
B) deflation prevents credit. Why lend when your currency is worth more tomorrow no matter what? Deflation is the enemy of anyone who borrows. 
C) not in the US.

Yeah no. The problem with crypto is 
A) continually increasing resource allocation costs to validate transactions
B) continual deflation that prevents banking and credit 
C) can't pay your taxes in crytpo

It won’t. It costs too much per transaction.
