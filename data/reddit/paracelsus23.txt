Who else put $100k on their credit cards in order to buy?

I don't deserve it - all I can do is be thankful, and pay it forward at some point.

Eric, I wish I had listened and bought BTC at $2 like you suggested.
... At least I finally got in at $7500...

Well, and in some parts of the country water used to be *really* cheap. My parents had a condo in the 1980s with shared metering and their portion of the water bill would be a dollar or two per month. Absolutely no value to installing (and reading) individual meters at those prices.

My understanding is that an entity gains control of greater than 50% of nodes and / of miners allows them to steer BTC *without* a fork - a much greater threat. I'll re-read your post in the morning when my mind is clearer. Thanks for the reply!

Please don't - I appreciate the offer and generosity, but Cytranic says he's up almost $1 million on bitcoin, and I feel bad enough about that.
Edit: thanks friend, I appreciate it. It means a TON.

$150 has the biggest smile on my face I've had in weeks. $1000 - fuck - I don't even know what I would have done. Run around outside screaming for an hour? What I received was 1000x more generosity than I expected. Thanks again.

I... Wow. You've made my week. Thanks.

It's great that you can make money if you have money. Rent is due today and I'll have $150 left over in my "portfolio" until my next paycheck.

I thought with mining you only got returns if you "struck" a coin - long stretches nothing with rare big payments. Is that not the case?

An incredibly generous redditor sent me 0.02295 BTC ($150), giving me one hell of a start. I'm beside myself with gratitude.

I mean, I had a friend who told me to buy when it just hit $20 / btc and I told him it was over valued. He called me when it hit $100 to gloat. I've been paycheck to paycheck that entire time, and investing even $100 felt like a huge risk. If I had done $100 when he told me to, I'd have over 30 grand today. Doing $100 now just seems pointless.

Something I've wondered about, with china's massive involvement in bitcoin - are we heading for a future where they'll have enough authority to unilaterally define rules? Perhaps even issue corrupt updates and validate them?

I finally got into bitcoin a month ago. When I was signing up, I found the coin base invite a friend sent me in *2011*. That hurt.
