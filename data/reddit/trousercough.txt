I have also found a few gems in the blockchain by inputting random passwords into the brain wallet generator at bitaddress.org. For example, the following pass-phrases yielded an address that had held bitcoin at some point.
* satoshinakamoto
* passwordpassword
* Warning: Choosing a strong passphrase is important to avoid brute force attempts to guess your passphrase and steal your bitcoins.

It was a pleasure to read your story and I'm glad that Bitcoin is helping you out in this way.  I don't want to burst your bubble but you should take note of the Terms of Service, specifically;
*8. No Foreign Currency Exchange
8.1 The customer must agree to never exchange Bitcoins purchased from coins.co.th for any currency other than Thai Baht. The customer must also guarantee that any Bitcoins the customer sells to coins.co.th have never been involved in exchange with any currency other than Thai Baht. In such case, no matter what type of foreign currency was involved, your action may be considered as dealing with foreign currency payment, and fall under the scope of jurisdiction of Ministerial Regulations No.1:3 (1954), as specified by the Exchange Control Act (1942).*
Now, this is ridiculous as no one can ensure that all of their coins have *never* been exchanged in any other currency than THB and I'm sure that Coins.co.th cannot either.  Just bear it in mind and have an excuse prepared just in case you are asked about it in the future.  For example, you sold some of your coins, for cash to a friend in THB in person and instructed them to abide by the TOS at Coins.co.th and perhaps they didn't do so.
All the best.

Precisely, but in my example, I am only responsible for maintaining one of them and therefore two on-chain transactions.  I'm assuming that the exchange will constantly have at least one channel open with a large amount of Bitcoin to allow people to withdraw via lightning.  I'm trying to verify whether or not lightning channels will be able to cross-communicate in this manner.
@_date: 2018-01-05 01:19:16
Thanks for posting, I wasn't aware of that.  At the moment, I am trying to understand lightning, MAST and Schnorr all at the same time and it's proving to be quite a challenge.

I appreciate you taking the time to post but I think we're wandering away from the original question here... The software will select the most efficient route I assume.
However, from that post I linked earlier the poster also states;


This again would suggest that my imaginary scenario is possible if the exchange had 100 BTC in a channel for example.

I realized the content of his comment wasn't in relation to anything that bch was doing, I merely mentioned it as being poignant to the discussion.  I don't see how fee sniping is relevant after the transaction confirms though nor is it relevant if the target block-height is included within the transaction data.  Unless I'm missing something...

@_date: 2019-07-15 04:18:38


Yes, one such solution is called loop in/out although this hasn't been eloquently merged into any wallet/node software yet as far as I'm aware.  Basically, instead of 2 transactions when a channel is empty, 1 to close and 1 to open another, all of that can be done with just 1 transaction that keeps the same channel open whilst adding or removing funds on-chain.
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:37:37
Sure.  I started with Eclair actually but switched to BLW for the extras although I have to admit, it has been a couple of months since I opened Eclair... maybe you can fill me in!  BLW has watchtower support already should you feel it necessary and also the ability to search the network for random peers by name whereas Eclair only had auto-connect to their node last time I used it.  BLW also implemented channel backups before Eclair as I recall, that was what made me switch initially.  I'm sure there's more but I forget..
@_date: 2019-07-11 16:32:19


The channel is yours, your funds, you initiated it.  You should be able to rely on it.


The can become unresponsive for some reason.. The node may go offline or close the channel.  You may open another one elsewhere.   There's not much point in running a public node to accept incoming channels if you're then just going to close them. Any such nodes would be easily identified by the community and avoidable as time wasters.


L2 isn't designed as a replacement for fiat cash in itself. It's complimentary to L1 as a better alternative for small, private, fast, daily transactions.  Bitcoin is not meant purely as a storage of value.
You seem to be arguing a point here not just asking questions as claimed in your post title.  If you don't like Bitcoin or the LN I'm not going to try to convince you.  I don't care what you invest in or use as an alternative to fiat currency. I mean that politely and sincerely, not as an insult.


I don't know what you mean by 'verify'.   Bitcoin within a LN channel is still Bitcoin and it's still yours.  If you want to send it on chain then you need to close the channel first.
@_date: 2019-07-10 23:26:40
What is that supposed to mean?
@_date: 2019-07-18 23:31:06
Yes, they should do.  I have core+LND over TOR with no ports open. After you activate it, your existing channels will stay open and existing peers will still see you but you will need to connect to a node as a peer before they can open a channel with you, as I understand it.  You can still open channels with random nodes with no issue.
@_date: 2019-07-22 15:00:55

@_date: 2019-07-19 08:31:28
There's plenty of apps and software that allow for encryption of words/phrases in many different ways but you're then typing your seed into a device with an internet connection which is poor opsec and is generally discouraged. 
One way to mitigate this is to obtain a separate computer that has never had nor never will have an internet connection.  You could then use software to encrypt your seed safely, theoretically at least.
As an example only;
See [this Android app]( for example. Click the 3 bars, top left and select cypher, then the dropdown menu in the center and select Vigenere.  Now you can enter your seed, enter a key and encrypt it.

What do you mean?  A single address?  People generally use a new address for each transaction..  we already have what you're describing for private communication - public/private key cryptography or asymmetric encryption, the same tech privacy focused chat apps/email clients like Telegram and Protonmail use. Look up PGP.
@_date: 2019-07-10 15:26:31
It really boils down to a difference of opinion, I wouldn't avoid using a certain word just because it's used elsewhere.  Also, it's how the UX feels.  You initiate the payment, it's pending for a couple/few of seconds, then you get a notification that your payment has been received, i.e a confirmation. 


A slightly strange example but no I'd say it's pending for those 2 seconds, confirmed as you let go of the bill.


There is.  At both the protocol and UX/GUI level.


I agree but what do you call those 1-5 seconds in between sending and confirmation then?  It's initiated then pending until confirmed. 


Same again.  What do you call those 1-5 seconds between initiating a transaction and it arriving (confirming) then?
@_date: 2019-07-17 10:16:05
Have you tried to [abandon the channel?](
@_date: 2019-07-10 14:47:59
Sure it's accurate.   It's a confirmation in L2, the funds are sent and confirmed as received by your recipient. Although I used the same word, I wasn't referring to a confirmation as in the transaction was included within a block.  If you disagree, then ill send you a LN invoice for $10 worth of Bitcoin, you pay it.  If indeed it's not confirmed as mine, then you can just change your mind and take it straight back...
@_date: 2019-07-11 21:39:38


Find an exchange that provides that service and/or wait for your current exchange to provide it.


Open a LN channel between both of those wallets.
@_date: 2019-07-22 13:34:14


Bitcoin's whole value proposition is that they are though.  Although it's generally advised that you wait for 6 network confirmations before you consider the funds to be absolutely yours...
My intention wasn't really to argue a point, hence my OP being phrased as a question, rather than a statement.  Thanks for your input.
My way of looking at this situation was that, once your transaction is confirmed with a particular block height stipulated within the transaction,  you needn't worry about the blockchain being rolled back to a point (block height) before the transaction was made.  Similar to checkpoints, but not the same.


They're are not my bcash checkpoints.  I don't own bcash,  I'm not a bch proponent nor do I support any particular fork of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-07-22 12:44:54

@_date: 2019-07-11 23:02:09


Depends.  For transactions between your own LN wallets, 0 fees as your could either set fees to zero or you'll be paying fees to yourself.  For transactions between you and an exchange, anywhere from 1mSat to 1 Sat or so.  It depends on the route and market/state of the LN at the time unless you open a channel with your exchange, then it could be next to nothing again.  It depends on the LN channel parameters.
@_date: 2019-07-22 14:51:56
No idea what you mean.  Go head over to r btc, you'll find plenty of people willing to argue with you over there.
@_date: 2019-07-11 19:17:57


LN provides this, plus privacy.
@_date: 2019-07-11 09:17:42
No worries.  Why were you upset at his transaction though?


But this is the desired intent of L2.  Eventually,  as the software comes out of beta and more people run nodes, open larger capacity channels and increase liquidity overall, the idea is that you'll be able to make $1000+ transactions as friction-less and as cheaply as this example.  The size of the transaction is irrelevant with regards to speed or the fee until you approach the maximum amount of Bitcoin in separate LAN channels.  The problem is finding a route for the larger transactions whilst liquidity is relatively low.  I think the Lightning torch that was being passed around between participants on Twitter managed to route a payment up to ~$150 and that was before the recent price rally... (the higher the price of Bitcoin in fiat = the smaller the amount of Bitcoin you need to route through the LN and the easier it becomes)
This transaction was for $6.61 worth of Bitcoin, you can already very easily buy your coffee via the LN.
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:14:16
Just curious, did the transaction occur whilst you were asleep?  Reason I'm asking is that I've seen a couple of posts here on reddit from users claiming strange things were happening and objects being moved whilst they slept even though there was no sign of a home invasion.  Turned out they had a carbon monoxide leak and they were poisoned.  Apparently it makes you perform actions during the night that you don't recall the next day.  Not trying to scare you here but, since you seem to have good opsec regarding your wallet and seed, it may be worth looking into. 
@_date: 2019-07-02 13:09:33
No problem.  They also have PS Plus subscription,  which I didn't know!!  I've been using them for cell phone top ups for probably a year now... always paying via the LN.

@_date: 2019-07-11 10:05:40


No.  Whereas custodial wallets do exist, you can (and should) use a non-custodial one.


You don't need unlimited channels.  Just one channel allows you to transact with everybody within layer 2 assuming you're connected to a well connected node.


This is the main misconception about the LN, I think.  Newcomers still seem view it a something entirely different from Bitcoin.  A LN channel is a 2-of-2 mulit-sig contract, a transaction on the blockchain.  It's not some other coin/token, you are using and transacting with Bitcoin albeit in a different way than with L1.  You don't need to check the balance by closing the channel.  Your wallet shoes the correct amount of an open channel already.


The same thing again.  Funds on L1 are definitely more secure than within a LN channel, that's for sure.  There are pros and cons.. there have to be otherwise it would just be the way it would have been done from the beginning.   L2 is complimentary to L1 and L2 requires L1 to work.  You should consider a LN channel as you would any other hot wallet with funds in it.

That's definately strange.  If you just wanted to lurk for the last 7 years, you didn't need to register an account.  Also, nobody is being scammed here, SN never encouraged anybody to buy Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-07-17 12:18:52
I've never used it but from your description, it sounds like it might be a solution.  Since enough blocks have been mined since the channel was closed at this point, the funds are surely back under your control although LND isn't showing that.
This is what made me think of suggesting it to you;


Worth a try.  Perhaps an old channel state wasn't removed after the channel closed making LND think it's still open..

@_date: 2016-03-26 02:22:34
I guess so.  It's just such a shame to have something so much more honest and innovative like Bitcoin and OB just to have it fail because humans are dishonest.  This is exactly what the existing power structure/paradigm wants and they could easily set up fake OB stores purely to rip people off and destroy it.
I can't help but think there MUST be a way to ensure that sellers really do post the item and buyers HAVE to be honest assuming that the item arrives and isn't lost in the post.  How will OB ever become more popular than eBay if this vital flaw is not solved first?
@_date: 2016-03-25 22:36:39


Could OB just enforce this policy to avoid this problem?;
* Buyer agrees to sale and sends Bitcoin to escrow
* Seller sees this, posts the item and displays the tracking number on their site.
* Once the tracking info reads "delivered" or "attempted delivery" seller can apply to mods or directly to the escrow to release the Bitcoin, that's if the buyer hasn't already done so.
One obvious drawback is that postage with tracking info costs more, especially for international postage.  However, given that we expect to save up to 30% over traditional e-commerce according to the OP, I find this to be quite acceptable.
What does the rest of think?

In a nutshell, they had an administrative error at their end and they held my Bitcoin hostage until they sorted it out.  Also, the 2 women that work there are unable to comprehend simple complaints and requests.
AVOID XAPO.

Im beginning to think that the main reason Segwit is opposed is that people just don't understand it.  Take the blocksize.  I've read that it will effectively result in 1.6, 1.7, 2.1 and even 4MB blocks.  It's a simple question but one that we can't even come to a consensus on.

I am the only one that thinks ' fuck the miners'?  Core shouldn't worry about easing the miners' fears at all.  They chose to run open source software of their own free will.  They have no right to mine or to make profit from this free and open source technology.  I would love for them to switch off their rigs and we can all go back to mining with a cpu.  Furthermore,  it's seems blatantly obvious to me that they would like this current situation to continue as long as possible to milk all of these fees.  I don't believe they want to HF.  
@_date: 2019-03-29 17:46:56
Do you realize how entitled that sounds?  You can currently send any amount of Bitcoin you wish, to somebody situated at any point on earth and pay just 47 cents to get into the next block.  That would be around 33 cents using native segwit addresses. It's perfectly reasonable and you could just pay 1sat/byte, about 0.5 cents and wait a few hours.
@_date: 2017-03-06 20:10:52
1. - Correct although whilst creating these in a wallet you will only see the public address.  You usually need to go through an extra step to view the private key for the public address .  In Bitcoin Core you have to export the private key with a certain command in the terminal.  This is presumably done to make it less likely for a user to copy and paste their private key publicly.  The same goes for Monero although the software is quite different and there are some extra features with that coin.  For Bitcoin I suggest Electrum wallet for PC, Mycelium for Android and Breadwallet for iOS.
2. - Correct.  I suggest using bitaddress.org ( download their tool from github ) and TAILS.  Create BIP38 encrypted wallets for extra security. Verify everything you download with official signatures.  Google is your friend here..
3. - Correct.  You may view this habit as not ' putting all your eggs in one basket. ' If one wallet is compromised then you only lose a portion of your coins, not the whole lot.
4. - Correct you can use this method.
5. - Correct.  You will pay a commission for every exchange although you may consider registering with an exchange that trades both Bitcoin and Monero.  That way you can go straight from cash to Monero and cut out some fees.
Hope this helps.

Like an escrow for the posted items...  They could also message the buyer with a photograph of the package to make sure it's what they actually ordered.  Interesting but it would come with extra costs and there would need to be a few of these strategically placed around the globe.  No good if people are selling things that may be illegal in some jurisdictions though.

Not sure how you're having issues.  Are you using native segwit bech32 addresses? They start bc1, some exchanges don't support that format yet..
@_date: 2017-03-17 21:47:20
Just leave them in that address since it will cost you more than 9 cents to send them.   Even before the higher fees it would still have cost you 5 cents to send them.

Yes I just have.  I only joined to have one of their debit cards to have as an extra option in case of emergency.
Anyway I joined about 8 months ago and immediately verified my account to lift the limits in the card as it would be useless to me otherwise.  Up until a couple of weeks ago, everything was fine.  I used the card a couple of times in various airports to check that I was fit for purpose and it was.  Then I get an email asking me to verify my account.  I seemed this was a spam email attempting to steal my login so I reported it to customer service.  The email was real however and then the nightmare started.  There are 2 or 3 women there that honestly seem to have no clue whatsoever and are completely unable to understand how to answer simple questions or solve simple problems.  They eventually indicated that the proof of residence that I provided months needed to be written in Latin.  They were unable to understand that I provided this month's ago and that they had already verified my account.  Having received an email stating that there was a hold on my account I immediately logged in to remove my Bitcoin.  Luckily I only kept a small amount in there by this point.  To my horror,  they had blocked me from being able to remove my Bitcoin and the constant emails to support were getting me nowhere.  The story does end well though, they eventually lifted the block and I got my coins out.  I did lose all trust after them holding my coins hostage and have demanded a full refund for the debit card.  They have refused this.  The last email I received thanked me for my feedback and indicated that my account will be closed in 2 days, for no reason!
My advice is to avoid Xapo at all costs.  If they have some administrative error on their end, they WILL hold you Bitcoin hostage until their incompetent staff eventually sort their own mess out.

Also, the more you find, the harder it becomes to mine what little remains.  You may also happen to strike it lucky and find one huge nugget one day which could be compared to a miner mining a block a bit faster than the 10 minute estimate or mining 2 blocks consecutively.

This is due to the fact that various lightning wallet UI's are not very intuitive at this point and most don't spend the time required to understand the tech.  They just download the wallet, hit one issue and complain about it in online forums.

I'm not at my laptop now so I can't check but I think you can go into preferences and disable dynamic fees.  Then you should be able to set whatever fee you want.  Check at  for the appropriate amount per byte.  Then, view the transaction, don't just broadcast immediately and it will show the transaction size in bytes.  You can multiply this by the amount suggested at  to arrive at the correct fee to include.
I never have a problem getting my transaction into the next block.  You just set have to be willing to pay the required fee.
@_date: 2019-03-04 21:44:41
I did too actually.  The error message suggested that I try the --upgrade command, so after downloading and verifying the download;
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade --user Electrum-3.3.4.tar.gz[fast]
Going from memory,  this worked for me.  Also bear in mind that Mint 19 comes with the necessary version of python pre installed, if you're on an earlier version you may need to upgrade python manually. 
Make sure download from electrum.org only and be aware of the recent phishing vulnerability in case it comes up again.

It's not really spam if they're paying to use the network for a given purpose.
@_date: 2019-11-02 07:24:43
It means to only use (spend from) an address once.  AFAIK most, if not all wallets will spend the whole amount on a single address when you send.  The coin go to your recipient,  a new change address (you) and the fee is left for the miner to claim.  When you spend you're signing the transaction and exposing this signature to the public which may or may not be a significant attack vector for a QC to attack (that particular address) at some point in the future.  If you perform this best practice,  the address will be empty and there is nothing for the QC operator to steal.
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:09:01
I'm curious how this is possible with the fees at such a reasonable level.  Has an extra 15% segwit adoption and simple transaction batching from exchanges really allowed the network to handle the same transaction throughput whilst reducing the required fee to get into the next block from around $35 to $0.36?
@_date: 2019-03-29 12:22:11


It was a rhetorical question :)  I am amazed that these things alone have had such a drastic affect on fees!

For every official and seemingly well funded piece of research claiming that climate change is real, you can find another claiming that it is false.  There is not total consensus in the scientific community at all.  First it was global cooling, then global warming, then climate change.  Now its admitted that climate was both hotter and cooler in the past despite the lack of any human industrial impact or activity.  Now it is just the rate at which we are supposedly changing our climate.  Notice how the politicians that deliver these chilling speeches informing us how we are destroying the planet then walk of stage into their chauffeur driven Jaguar saloon with a 4.0L V8 engine.  They know it isn't real and the know the ignorant masses will buy it.  It is very obviously a lie and Bitcoin is certainly not going to destroy our climate.

Faucets don't exist for you or anybody else to profit from.  The free service is there to help newcomers familiarise themselves with the technology before investing any serious amount into it.
Any faucet that you have used, that sent out the amount as indicated has worked perfectly well and there's no reason to consider them "abysmal".  Infact, if someone was to drain the whole faucet of funds then the service would no longer be available to other newcomers and they would be doing a great diservice to the community.

It cost me around $0.2882 ( at the current rate ) so no, it will not cost more than a dollar.  If you only use 100% fee recommendation it will cost slightly less but may take longer to be accepted into a block at the moment.
@_date: 2018-10-26 17:55:28
You don't understand Bitcoin's value if you think you should invest (risk it) after buying it.  Especially given the current state of the entire legacy financial paradigm.  Sure, use a small percentage for day to day costs via Lightning, but for the most part, and certainly for the foreseeable future, it is digital gold.  Its value is set to rise exponentially over the next couple of decades before it becomes stable.  It IS the investment and it is already risky.  It makes no sense whatsoever to increase your risk by investing it further.
@_date: 2018-10-22 21:38:57

It isn't peer-to-peer.  The transaction is broadcast to the mempool where it will remain for some time before being selected to be included into a block and then broadcast amongst nodes.  There is no direct link/connection between you and the recipient with a normal, onchain transaction. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 20:27:57
You're doing excellent work.  Well done.
@_date: 2018-10-31 16:08:09
Depends on how you look at it.  Considering just that transaction where you spend via a Lightning  channel between you and the recipient, that's peer-to-peer.  You are connecting directly to their hardware using their IP address and a specific port.  If you connect to a hub however, there will be several hops over the network between you and the recipient.  There are always third parties involved though, writing the code, producing the hardware and providing your internet connection etc.

You seem to be referring to mining, am I right?  That isn't the only way to invest and it's generally not profitable unless you mine as part of a pool.  Even then, the difficulty is so high you may struggle just to break even.
You could just buy BTC now and hope to sell them and make a profit at some point in the future.  Alternatively you can trade BTC aginst USD and CNY with certain brokers which is extremely risky and I wouldn't suggest that.
I suggest a bit more reasearch before you invest your $1-2K.

Don't worry about that.  So you will have an option to set the fee when you send coin, this functionality differs between wallets.  Basically, the higher fee you pay, the higher the chance that your transaction will be included in the next block and therefore, confirm.  I'm guessing that you inadvertently set fee this too low.
You can look in your wallet or paste the txID/address you sent to in a blockchain explorer to find out what fee you paid.
If you look [here]( the lowest fee you can pay to be included into the next block is 0.00015820 BTC.
After a set amount of time, ( I forget how long ) if your transaction is not confirmed, then it falls out of the mempool and your coins fall back under your control.

You do need to send some funds to free up inbound capacity in that channel.

Think of a channel as a doorway into layer 2 for you to be able to send and receive Bitcoin in that layer.  Yes, you pay to open that doorway, it's the same experience as performing a regular Bitcoin transaction, only with a couple of options.  You set the capacity of channel and you're locking that amount into the channel. You also select the node with which you'd like to connect. You'll see those funds separate from your on chain funds now in your wallet.  Lets say you put $100 worth of Bitcoin into a channel.  After that transaction has confirmed you now have a full channel with $100 capacity that you can send to anybody you want via the LN.  If you have a channel with your recipient,  the transaction will be almost instant.  If you don't, your transaction is routed through the LN to your recipient automatically and will take a couple of seconds more, perhaps 20 depending on the ever changing state of the network.
Just one channel allows you to transact with everybody within the LN.  There is no need to open a separate channel with everybody you wish to transact with, hence my doorway analogy.
Further info;
Currently and using the example above, you can receive Bitcoin via the LN but your channel is full ($100) and you'd need to spend some first to make room in that channel to receive (inbound capacity).  So you spent $5, and now can receive $5 if you want.  Eventually,  you will be able to request inbound capacity from the node as you open your channel, at the same time.  If they agree, you'll put $100 into a channel that has a total capacity of $200.  Now you can send $100 and receive up to $100 as soon as your channel opens (on chain transaction confirms).
You can also request inbound capacity from a node which will open a separate channel with you and you can receive funds via this method too.
Also currently,  you need the recipient to generate an invoice (qr code) for you to pay them.  Eventually,  you'll be able pay directly to their node ID which doesn't change and which you could save in an address book in your wallet for convenience.


Probably not, but she doesn't need to "get it".  When she learned email, you wouldnt explain it at the technical / protocol level.  You sit down and walk her through the process a few times.  I'm sure you could teach your grandma to write down 12 words and keep them secret, choose a pin, then perform a transaction.   A helpful on screen tutorial or hints could and likely will manage this very well.

Yes, for that type of transaction,  you would request the sender doesn't utilize RBF.  If they do, wait for at least 1 confirmation before leaving them with your cash.  If it is a large amount, wait for 6 confirmations.

Out of curiosity, I checked the link and found an abvious mistake within a few seconds.




The problems are that we cannot know how many Bitcoin are in circulation due to that fact that a certain amount have been lost forever.  Also, due to the inherant privacy in Bitcoin transactions via the LN, we cannot obtain any of the other figures required for the formula. 


No.  That is how you and the author have decided to value cryptocurrency.  That's all.  What they have done is to look at the system, find as many abstract values as possible and mash it all together in a formula in order to be able to obtain the highest figure possible and call that the so called valuation.  Ridiculous.   I told you already, people are free to use and therefore value it as they please.  And currently,  the market appears to value it as a SoV unless you want a definite current valuation in fiat terms, then people generally use total market cap (which has its flaws obviously) 
[Here is how you calculate market cap](
And I do venture into sometimes, mostly for amusement.  My favourite comment I like to make currently is to big blockers that like to brag how bcash is the closest to Satoshi's idea as written in the whitepaper.

Is anybody aware of any reliable stats for the current figure for transactions per second with the Bitcoin network?  I've been seeing 3 - 7 tx/second quoted for years now which simply cannot be accurate given the steady increase in segwit adoption &amp; transaction batching by exchanges.  Also, we should start to include Bitcoin transactions over the Lightning Network too.  While not on-chain, these are still Bitcoin transactions and are therefore relevant.  I'm aware of the inherent privacy with LN transactions but im hoping there would be some way to reasonably estimate transaction throughput for the entire Bitcoin network.

And I'm aware of that.
It isn't just Binance though.  I looked at the transaction details from my last withdrawal and I'm disappointed to report that only about 10% of the outputs were bech32 format, about 30% were P2SH and the rest were legacy address format.  Nice to see they were batching their withdrawal transactions though.  Lack of native segwit adoption appears to be mostly with users as far as I can tell.  They definitely do need to allow deposits to a bech32 address but if they just switch over, even with warnings via email, a lot of users will still send to their old deposit addresses ..  And they will blame Binance for lost funds.  It's going to take some time.

@_date: 2019-04-08 11:32:31


I know this will sound insulting but you lack an intrinsic understanding of a decentralized network.  Once this is attained, the need for small or even smaller blocks becomes obvious.  Not bigger ones.  And raising the blocksize would not solve the separation within the community.  It has separated indefinitely now.

@_date: 2019-04-23 07:00:27
Honestly, I'm not technically qualified to comment either way.  Unless you're a miner I guess were both speculating and it would be best to get a miner to confirm exactly how they prioritize coins to be included into any block they find.
From my perspective, it makes no sense to prioritize coins based on their age.  As a miner with profit in mind and overheads to consider, I'd include the transactions that net me the largest profit from the largest fees.  That's all.
I always refer to [bitcoinfees.earn.com]( if I need a transaction to get into the next block.  Looking at that site now shows that there have been no transactions attempted with 0 fee within the last 336 hours.  Not that I'm doubting you but I would expect a couple to have been made at least if it was possible..


Not if the mempool becomes empty which occurred very frequently from ~Jan 2018 up until a couple of weeks ago.

Yes they can as long as their wallet supports bech32 also.  The whole ecosystem needs to update for wide support and adoption.

Obviously with Microsoft enjoying some 90% market share most software developers do target Windows.  However, with the exception of gaming, I have never struggled to find an application to fit purpose.  In fact, Steam are supporting more and more games for Linux over time and I see that trend accelerating personally.  Another big advantage is the use of software repositories in Linux similar to the Play store on Android.  Thousands of applications ready to install with a simple command or through the GUI installer with the added advantage that they have been checked for malware beforehand.

Well it's true.  The fee isn't calculated via the blocksize, it's nothing to do with the blocksize.  It's calculated using the transaction size in bytes and expressed as sat/byte.  Actually,  you could pay 1 sat/byte, ~0.8 cents, and you could currently expect that transaction to be confirmed in 15-300 minutes.  It's the same whether you send $15 or $15M assuming the transaction size (in bytes) remains the same.

Its been a long time since I've done it but if you've imported your private key you actually 'sweep' the funds to the next receiving address in electrum.  Are you sure you haven't just imported your public key?  That would give you a watch only account.   You had to enter your password via the terminal within Core to unlock your wallet and then specify the public key for which you get the private key.  Again, from memory, the private key starts with 5 if I recall correctly.  Does that sound familiar?

For opening a channel in Eclair though, whist sending you just press on the box to enter your own fee and type 1.  It's already denoted in sat/byte.  If fees have spiked though, be aware that it could be a day or 2 to get that transaction confirmed.   I've never had to wait more than 6 hrs or so for most of this year.
I don't know of any exchanges that allow you to withdraw via Lightning yet but I expect they should start showing up in 2019.  Eclair does not allow you to receive via Lightning yet.  Again we await further development of the wallet.

It's a valid point and I'd say that if they did accept BTC via Lightning, it would most likely be used by techies at first for the novelty, then hopefully going on to become adopted in the future.  It really will be up to us to go out of our way to use BTC/Lightning at every available opportunity to really provide the incentive for businesses to accept it.  The key to major adoption will be for people to be paid their wages in Bitcoin, thus removing the inconvenience and added cost from buying it on an exchange beforehand.  I just wonder how long it will take for the volatility to subside enough for people to accept Bitcoin as their wage payments.

Read the comment again, I wasn't suggesting that you should apologize.   I'm saying that pleanty of people post predictions,  some will obviously be correct and others, wrong.  The loud mouths that are proven wrong as price action develops usually just disappear.  You or your computer  haven't predicted anything, you're just guessing and happen to have been correct so far.  If you disagree and think you can predict the future, predict the price of BTC, on Bitmex, at any given time you choose and open a 50BTC position with high leverage and post proof here.  If you're correct, do it again and again 20 times in a row with proof.  Then, and only then can you claim to be able to accurately predict the future price of BTC.

LN wont help here since you'll be consolidating your outputs on chain.
Just send all your funds to your next receiving address and set the fee to 1 sat/byte.  Currently, your transaction should take roughly 0-80 minutes to confirm.  Enable RBF if your wallet supports it.  If you haven't already started using bech32 addresses,  you might want to start now to help save on fees for future transactions.

I came across his whilst using Eclair.  Disable the Cap Lightning Fees setting which caps the fee at 3% to guard against oppurtunistic nodes.  If you try to send 1 satoshi and the fee is 1 satoshi, that's 100% fee which sounds bad, but obviously isn't.

The only useful piece of information a hacker would be able to obtain from an exchange would be your personal email address.  As long as you didn't use the same password for your personal email as you did with the exchange, the only thing a hacker could use this info for would be to socially engineer an attack via malicious email.  Tricking you into opening a malicious file or link would be one example to gain access to your PC.

This is why I'm so puzzled by the ETH price.  It's not scarce, it's not designed to be used as a store for value and all that a high ETH price will achieve is to make it more expensive for people to use the platform.  I'm honestly surprised that the value of ETH is higher than $1.

Well, over 5000 years of human civilisation disagrees with you here.  However, I do agree that technically it doesn't have limited supply.

You rebel!
Anyway here's my advice.  Find an exchange in the the UK,  Iv'e seen people have so many complaints with coinbase on here.  Also, to buy from coinbase you will need to send money abroad I'm guessing which will entail extra time and fees.  When your'e set up on an exchange you will go into core and choose your first receiving address.  Input that address into the exchange withdrawal form and wait for it to confirm.
I'm guessing your'e new to Bitcoin, look up Electrum (wallet).  You will be up and running in 10 mins.  With core, you will need to download and sync the entire blockchain which may take a couple of days.
Hope this helps.

As an actual, regular user, I can tell you that its stable and reliable enough for small amounts.  "Small amounts" is obviously subjective, however, I opened my first channel with $100 (worth of Bitcoin) of capacity over a year ago and  2 channels with $100 capacity in them about 4 months ago.  Actually,  given the recent price increase for Bitcoin against the usd, my channels now have more in them in usd value than they had in them when I opened them!  Not bad for someone in a developing country..  I've had no issues with transactions or fund loss and I control my own keys.  Given the situation in Venezuela and the fact that the average income is low there, I'd say that 1 or 2 hundred usd of capacity would be adequate for daily transactions there. 


1 sat/byte is a normal fee.  In fact, there are no abnormal fees.  You can send the transaction before you go to bed and it would be confirmed by the morning.
I suggest that you download a LN enabled wallet and try it for yourself instead of listening to the people that are telling you it doesn't work.

This.  Also it would be highly beneficial for the network to update to a wallet that supports bech32 addresses, advise newcomers to start with bech32 addresses (Mycelium is good for newcomers as it allows you to toggle between bech32 and P2SH in case you need it). Also, email your exchange and any businesses you use and request that they upgrade to support bech32 addresses and LN deposits/withdrawals regularly until they do so.
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:37:54




No it isn't.  Those are two very different figures.
You needn't pay $6 to open a $10 channel.  Pay just 1sat/byte (about 1 cent) and let the transaction confirm overnight.  Also you may open a $100 channel if you wish.  I did this back in January and I still have that same channel open today.  Also, why are you talking about onboarding people onto Lightning?   It's not a service or different token.  A LN channel is merely an on-chain (multi-sig) transaction.  Newcomers ar not onboarding, they're just using it.


Yes it has.  Constantly for over 3 years now.  And I say it's done because you have alternatives now.  It's quite clear that the overwhelming majority don't want to scale via bigger blocks and they're not going to change their mind for you.  You can leave.


Not for people in developing countries.   We don't all know this, you just think it.  And with bigger blocks, the blockchain would be far bigger than 1Tb in the future.  Think further ahead than 5 minutes and you'll get it.


If you're still flogging this dead horse at this point, then no, you don't support Bitcoin.

I'm not sure what your last point means.. It is an issue although wallets have improved alot since I last spent from a cold wallet. I recall a lot of posts here, some years back, complaining about these issues.  If by,
 &gt;the main bitcoin wallet
you mean Core, then sure, you may lose funds if you don't back up the wallet correctly. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 10:55:03
I just paid that!
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:17:53
You can toggle between bech32 and P2SH.  You have to go into settings and select bech32 for the change address format and obviously select bech32 when you display your receive address.

Yet it hasn't in almost 6 months..  reality suggests otherwise. 




And the LN offers fees so low that they're almost free.  If they don't also have the ~1 cent to open a channel, even 0 fees won't help unfortunately.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:35:55
No, the link obvious.  Check out [wasabi wallet.](  Also, Bitcoin sent via the Lightning Network offer a high degree of privacy too.
@_date: 2017-06-16 12:26:52


This.  This would be amazing to see. Hopefully he/she is pro Segwit!
@_date: 2019-05-19 16:30:19
Why do you think that?  Do you have evidence of a large number of people struggling to open a LN channel?
@_date: 2018-12-19 03:10:30


What do you mean by this?
@_date: 2019-05-16 01:09:34
Sure, like I said though,  that's a temporary safety requirement.  I'd expect that amount to be lowered within a year.  Also, a LN wallet is ideal for general daily purchases.  Certainly in the first world, I'd say most people have $30-$50 fiat in their wallet or in a debit account (with card) at any one time and wouldn't struggle with that amount for funding their LN wallet.  Also, we have plenty of time to get the tech right.  Very few places accept Bitcoin today.
@_date: 2019-05-05 19:09:43
Good point.  I expect you'll be able to select what lock time you'd like from the wallet UI in time making watchtowers much more useful.
@_date: 2019-05-27 08:40:15
It's just a figure of speech.
The rest of your comment is meaningless within the context of this conversation.
@_date: 2019-05-10 03:04:04
I use [this website]( to estimate my fee requirement for transactions and have found it to be accurate and reliable for a year or so.


They should consider using the Lightning Network then.
@_date: 2019-05-24 06:09:18
We don't have any of those coins.  We have Bitcoin and altcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-22 23:06:54
Paper wallets have their own set of issues too and I wouldn't rate them any higher than a Trezor wallet.  You have to trust the people that write the code to produce the paper wallet, trust your ability to run it in a sand-boxed environment. I've also seen stories of people losing funds from paper wallet usage because they didn't spend the whole amount from it and lost a large portion to a temporary change address.  Don't forget the extra hassle that comes from storing the paper so that it doesn't fade, get wet or burned in a house fire.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:10:48


Well you've failed to assume any responsibility whatsoever.  You seem to think that Electrum devs are responsible for your family members' loss.


There's no debate to be had.  Whoever voluntarily installed the malware is 100% at fault.


You're still expecting other people or institutions to take care of you, hold your hand and forgive any mistakes you make.  You have the responsiblity to secure your own financial sovereignty and verifying software takes 5 seconds.  Also, were talking about various geographical locations with differing laws and jurisdictions.. this isn't a simple matter. 


As soon as they had 1 transaction confiscated,  they definitely would start doing so.
@_date: 2019-05-15 14:30:10
Mycelium does now, Electrum and Trezor+Electrum too.

Please read the rules on the right side of the page.

Have them download Eclair testnet and send some coin both onchain and via Lightning.
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:42:32
Or just use a Trezor with a passphrase.  I haven't read the article yet but there simply is not a way to hack that.
@_date: 2019-05-27 02:44:59
There's nothing I can do to help people who voluntarily install malware onto their computer excpet tell them to learn from their mistake.

I have seen battery pack addons for the pi.  Perhaps it is possible to have the pi monitor the battery power supply and perform a shutdown when the battery charge gets too low..

This conversation has been done to death at this point.  You have bch to use if you want to enjoy big blocks.


It's $450.
@_date: 2018-12-28 13:03:14
I'm aware that they have.  However, if you used a passphrase, then the hacks still didn't obtain access to your Bitcoin.  This was the case with Trezor, I don't know about Ledger.
@_date: 2016-07-10 18:43:51
No.  There will never be 1 Trillion Bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-12-28 16:26:06
Never dealt with this but you can download the latest version of Electrum, verify it first and import your Trezor. Then go to addresses and you can see how many coins you have and on which address.  You may need to consolidate if you have coin on several addresses.
Or, open the Trezor web wallet, make a note of your next receiving address, send your coin to it and use that, after the TX confirms of course.
@_date: 2017-06-14 20:00:08
Not quite the same situation though.  We don't have coins on those chains like we will after UASF and we have coins on both.
@_date: 2018-12-04 19:24:40
This outlines a good usecase for a trezor wallet and passphrases..
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:57:11
My guess is $3,294 within 2 weeks.
@_date: 2018-12-06 02:57:49
Nice.  I'm hoping Binance get their act together and support it soon too.
@_date: 2019-05-27 03:13:03
Response to that suggestion, above.
@_date: 2018-12-27 11:07:24
Yes, the Trezor web-wallet allows for this but you have to estimate and input the block number for the funds to become spendable.
@_date: 2019-05-21 14:42:14
If Bitcoin goes to $35K at some point in the future and we assume that no further reduction in transaction sizes have been implemented (unlikely), then you may open a channel for just 8.2 cents (1 sat/byte).
Where are you getting these $7 figures from?  Really...  if someone has just $35 to their name, where are they getting a phone/computer from, electricity and an internet connection?
It seems obvious to you but reality just doesn't reflect this.  It's just an idea in your mind, nothing more.  Instead if making this nonsense up why don't you go download Eclair now and open a channel paying just 1 sat/byte. Then you'll see.


You think you know better than a group of experts with decades of computing, cryptography and coding expertese?  When you board a plane do you ask the captain if he's fuelled up first or advise him on the correct altitude to fly at?  Do you ever run what you're about to say through the logic center of your brain?
@_date: 2017-06-02 13:14:10
Really?  Lets say you wanted to send $1000 via PayPal.  [That would currently cost you $29.30 according to their literature](  It would only cost you [$2.79]( at the time of writing this, using Bitcoin, assuming the ideal 1 input, 2 output scenario and getting your transaction confirmed into the very next block. Nobody is forced to HODL.  Sell your Bitcoin then if your'e not content, it will only cost you $2.79 to do so.
EDIT: Added 'using Bitcoin.'
@_date: 2019-05-23 11:26:36
Electrum devs can't stop people from downloading scam wallets and installing them.  You're supposed to verify software before installing it.
@_date: 2018-12-14 03:59:04
I do recall it requiring a hard reset from the video I watched.  I think it was ctrl + shift + r.

@_date: 2019-05-20 02:11:55
You're free to pay less than 1 cent in fees and wait for the channel to open.  On a finite planet, "I want everything immediately and for free" isn't really a plausible mindset in the long term.
@_date: 2019-05-16 09:04:02
Whilst your at it, you may want to consider setting up a [lightning node]( which includes a full node.

It wasn't a severe security vulnerability. Your funds were never put at risk by Electrum software. It was a phishing attack.


The phishing scam asked the user to voluntarily download and install malware themselves. The pop-up couldn't install the malware of its own accord.  If you had verified the software as per Electrum devs' explicit instructions,  you would have realized and thwarted the scam attempt.  There wasn't even (still isn't) an Electrum version 4.0.0... this was so easy to spot without even verifying a PGP signature.   You should never install unverified software onto any device, especially software of a financial persuasion. 


The mistake was your father's.  
Sorry for your (father's) loss but you really need to learn from this, accept responsibility and let it go.  The fact that you or a family member fell for this is the reason they exist in the first place and now there is incentive for more of these attacks to happen to others in the future.  There is nothing you can do since you're unable to prove to any exchange that you didn't voluntarily send the funds.  Furthermore,  the attackers could easily mix their ill gotten gains before sending them to the exchange. 
We're targeting pure financial sovereignty with this movement.   There will be no banks to hold your hand and cover any mistakes you make within this new system.
@_date: 2019-05-16 00:43:11
These minimum amounts are not costs since they are still your funds and it's required at this point to provide sufficient incentive for people not to try to cheat since they will lose at least that much when the punishment transaction is broadcast. 
Like with the current maximum channel amount, those safety presets will be adjusted as the tech matures.  **The actual cost of opening a channel is just the transaction fee**.  Currently, BLW doesn't support custom fees, I just checked and it would be 58 cents under current network usage to open a channel. If custom fees were enabled, you could pay just 1.9 cents and wait for your transaction to confirm overnight.  You have this option already in Eclair although the transaction size and cost would be slightly more since they use the P2SH address format, not bech32 yet.
@_date: 2019-05-10 02:42:10
Well, paying just 1sat/byte (about 0.7 cents or so assuming you're utilizing native segwit addresses)  would get your transaction confirmed in 20-360 minutes.  I don't think that is expensive.

@_date: 2019-05-16 09:08:10
I've emailed Binance twice already.  They support the bech32 address format for withdrawals but not deposits yet.  They do batch withdrawals though so that's something at least.
