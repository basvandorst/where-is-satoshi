Are you out of your mind? Telling people to place stop-loss orders when this is actually the main way the beginners lose their money in "panic sells" whenever there is a flash dip event. Like yesterday. What do you think how these avalanche-like sells happen. It is stop-losses triggering for a good part of it. Telling nervous investors to set stop-losses is bad advice mallard worthy. If they have more money in that they are willing to lose, they are doing it wrong.
My advice: deduct the stop-loss money from your investment and immediately take it the fuck out of a market that is unpredictable. This is what you would keep if the stop-loss triggered tonight. 
Then let the rest do what it does in its natural habitat and don't freak out anymore and interfere with it whenever it moves either way.

There is never one reason. There are always hundreds of reasons that effect the current situation. You may look at the ingredients, but the outcome is even hard  to explain ex post i.e. with hindsight. People who tell you the situation formed "because" of A would tell you "despite" of A in the case of a different outcome. A may be the same factor in totally different market swings. Very much like in weather.
Personally I prefer to think of the market as a system that needs to "breathe" regularly.

Just take your business somewhere else. Easy as that. They are playing you idiots and you don't realize that by staying with them you fund their spamming the mempool.

Not true. Tons of people are stuck in verification backlogs of the exchanges. Will still be weeks before all people are in that wanted to join in 2017.

Can't believe they just have 2 % of the funding. Really would like to see more easily accessible content being created. Most people I meet and who want to learn about Bitcoin, cryptocurrency, decentralized, censorship-resistant peer-to-peer value communication don't even know about the latter aspects in the list. So typically after explaining for an hour or so, I would like to point them into the direction of Andreas Antonopoulos. But, if they only would have 60 minutes, I often pointed them to the 'prequel' video. If you can only spend 60 minutes, watch this one. It will not answer all of your questions, but the first 30 minutes deal with a lot of questions about money. The rest is about Bitcoin and also leaves a million questions open, but that is not its fault. It is just a big rabbithole going down here and you have to start somewhere. An updated and upgraded version of the video would be so great, so please support it in one or the other way!

Thanks for the heads up! I thought it was only me. Wanted to simply change my e-mail address and they insist to go through a verification procedure with me as if I just registered with the platform. I am their customer since 2013. It would be easy to use a combination of login/password/2FA/access to old e-mail to make a safe e-mail address change happen. I mean, other exchanges can do that. Not so current Bitstamp. Want photos of my passport and utility bill again, seriously, WTF!?
If every interaction needs filling out KYC formularies over and over again I begin to understand their backlog.

How simple life must appear to you. Bitcoin did not even take its final form.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:06:38
Noob advice. If B applies, you are in crypto with money that is not yours, so that goes without saying. If A applies, you are in crypto with money you can't afford to lose, also a nobrainer. The remaining advice, to take out the original investment is the classical anal investors logic, but it doesn't stand daylight inspection. 
The only upside of the last advice is, if you follow it through thorougly, you will probably never have to deal with high gains in the first place.
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:52:58
TIL Andreas Antonopoulos can hold his breath for 8 minutes without even noticing.
@_date: 2018-01-05 12:04:45
Not only the 16.000 but also the other values are divisible by 5.
@_date: 2018-01-22 16:24:20
If somebody followed your advice, they would probably never get into a situation of incredible gains. Because they cash out their original investment as soon as possible. That is not how investing works.
Edit: Downvoting this or the above comment doesn't make you a more successful investor. I'm telling you the truth because I care. Maybe let it settle down if it feels new or awkward. Also observe yourself the next time you made massive gains. What did you do there? Did you believe in the investment after you informed yourself even during some dips or did you chicken out at the first possible moment?

I mostly watch this video: [Price Down, Pick Up!](

Probably? You must be an expert. I'm sure he didn't give it to himself.

"Electricity" as in having access to electricity provided by some sort of plant I guess. These dry cells were available for radios in 1923:

The title says "less than 5%" and the comment above ignores the words "less than" and takes the 5% as a fixed value instead of an upper bound. It got 123 points and is the top comment as of now for addressing a straw man and effectively only saying it should be "far less" instead of "less". That's why _HandsomeJack_'s comment is pure gold in my eyes.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:37:52
Show me any group of engineers, comp sci majors, tech savvy nerds today and I show you a group of people with 90% still not being into bitcoin. 
Take any Andreas Antonopoulos talk. He's doing polls in the beginning. Even in these audiences full of interested and educated people only a small fraction has bitcoins.
@_date: 2018-08-27 13:18:39
You also have a Candlestick Cheat Sheet (pdf) which lists a lot of patterns with fancy japanese names. Did you create it? If not, what is the source?
@_date: 2018-08-27 10:53:09
Your effort is highly appreciated, but please be careful with publishing guides while you are still in the process of familiarizing yourself with the topic.
I myself am learning about Bitcoin since 2013 and I still consider myself in the process of familiarizing myself with it.
A secure protocol assumes that the computer is compromised and can't be trusted. End of story. In your guide you offer a lot of suggestions that may create a feeling of false security. 
No update, no anti-malware can make sure that your system, your actions, your keys are not being watched.
Also storing your data in the cloud and "considering" to encrypt the data is another weak point at best.
@_date: 2018-10-27 21:35:13
Did you try [blockchair.com]( It has many filters, exports, visualizations, powerful search and other interesting features.
@_date: 2018-06-14 12:12:47
Yeah, and no way to pay with Bitcoin. Only Google Pay. Really sad, because at first glance it looked like work that admires the beauty of Bitcoin and wants to give it a form.
Edit: oh, ok, I saw only the fat GPay button and did not follow through the complete checkout procedure. Nice then!
@_date: 2018-06-28 09:14:32
Please keep in mind that Bitcoins are not really "on the move" or can be somewhere in between accounts/addresses. They are either on one address or the other. If a transaction does not get through, the Bitcoin never left the address they were on. In this case, somebody transferred 0.1 BTC to another address and the 298 million dollars were the "change" that went back to an address in their wallet.

Did you try it ever and the timer disappeared immediately?
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:41:44
Those are the same people that appear to feel physical pain every time you talk about something they don't know shit about. So while you talk with somebody else they need to interrupt you and make clowns of themselves by throwing in a totally unconnected year-old headline like "Internet!? I heard that is trying to replace libraries!"
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:58:34
I'm not scared. Checking the address is just responsible standard procedure nowadays.

Since there was not a single reply of either Coinbase or Reddit, I guess I was just ripped off. Feels very strange. Did not see this one coming. I may keep writing mails to Reddit, but they don't bother to answer. Neither is Coinbase. Where else could I write to? I find this outrageous. We are talking 7.57 mBTC here, but I am not willing to write it off because they decided to ignore me.
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:33:32
Had to check which subreddit I'm reading. You do realize, that prefering cash over cards does in no way contradict the ideas underlying Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-17 17:23:04
My wallet showed it immediately, the payment processor didn't acknowledge the payment and let his 15 minutes timer run out. I'm doing a lot of payments with bitcoins and most services immediately give you feedback like "payment received" (e.g. when buying stuff at Steam) and then wait for confirmations behind the scenes until you can finally download the content you bought. What happened today was different: the ticket was invalidated after 15 minutes.
@_date: 2017-09-15 18:26:22
Isn't 1) a little self-contradictory? I think, the biggest group is 4) uninformed people who still have an opinion.

I haven't met any. That's all I can tell you about them.
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:28:14
Of course it is not a dark side of Bitcoin, but of paying the wrong people with Bitcoin. As I already mentioned in my post, I'm all for no chargebacks! Only this time I wish I hadn't make such a bad decision messing with somebody to show me the dark side of bitcoin payments.

5) "well-adjusted" people who are nicely consuming their daily dose of FUD in their local filter bubble and start regurgitating the stuff all over the place as soon as they hear a trigger word. "will be banned", "drug money", "no value", "everybody could make one", "not backed" etc. FUD zombies. 
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:30:43
I did not say there is something wrong with Bitcoin. Will take your advice to never ever pay a dubious party with Bitcoin again. Just out of habit I thought it would be ok. It is not, if you can't trust the third party. That is the dark side of Bitcoin payments I'm currently experiencing.
