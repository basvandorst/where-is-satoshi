Too high fees, sorry

Ah, so you want the tip to arrive in 2020?
@_date: 2017-12-12 12:42:25
I think people read  and did not get the message. Now they think Bitcoin Cash has a CEO.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:44:23
I think I do but please go ahead and tell me what I got wrong so I can learn from that. I am open to discussion and eager to learn

See, you can't even counter these arguments. BTC is definitely not usable as a currency anymore. Stick with your "store of value" or whatever you think it has become now

In 2-3 weeks? What are you expecting to happen in that period? A sudden strike of lightning? 
I don't want to be pessimistic but please do not misinform new users. There is nothing that will change the current fees soon until some major changes are made or all of a sudden, segwit adoption increases.

No but it uses cryptographic hash functions which can be solved way more easily with a quantum computer than a traditional one. Yes this definitely is an attack vector for now but commercial quantum chips won't be a thing in the next few years and I assume/hope that Bitcoin has changed to POS unitl then anyway.

Nice try, you should have read it yourself first:


anything, we’re a dis-organization. Bitcoin Cash is a meta-organization composed of 
many different development teams. **The Bitcoin Cash organization has no titles other 
than those which we make up for fun in the spur of the moment, or to make fun of the
organizations of the old world that care for titles.**

Can you please show us some references of these accusations?

You can usually check 
As you can see your 250sat/b transaction fits in the purple stripe and won't be confirmed for a few days at least, assuming the mempool is going to keep its current growth.

1) Yes you should not equate it but your statements are exaggerated and wrongly generalizing. Yes some gambling is pure luck and completely random and some is not. But as you said, markets are not random and only skilled people should trade/invest in these markets. For the rest of the current crypto holders this is indeed gambling, they have no clue what they do and see prices going up and invest in the hope of making money without knowing anything about the logics behind.
2) BTC (or any other crypto currency) cannot bust overnight? Why are you so sure? What if there is suddenly a bug which has some destroying effects on the network? Look at TheDAO in Ethereum, which could have gone way more wrong than it did. Gladfully ethereum could recover from that. Though since Bitcoin and Blockchain is "only" software, there are most certainly bugs. Some may be major and some minor, but let's just hope that they are first discovered and fixed by the community and developers before anyone can abuse them.
3) I completely agree with you here.
4) I agree with you here as well. But this argument is also contrary to you 2) argument. You say BTC cannot bust overnight but this technology is just so different from everything else in history that one should be very careful making statements based on experience in other markets.

I was referring to mining. Using quantum computers a malicious miner could easily mine faster (finding the correct hash) and therefore control the Blockchain due to PoW.

But was that the intention behind cryptocurrencies? To use them as an asset instead of a currency?
