Bitcoin is not ice cream..... Or any other store bought product. This analogy makes sense but doesn't really apply to Bitcoin.

Hahaha but credit is "real money" or the numbers on the screens trasnfered from a bank to your employer to your bank. Is "real money" that is just numbers going from 1 screen to another no physical "money" ever moves anywhere. It's all a smoke a mirrors show.

I would think the call would log the IMEI somehow being a police stations is a government facility I'd think all traffic in and out is analyzed. and that could be then traced to a device serial number or something similar leading to a manufacturer leading to a shipping manifest that shows that phone was in stock at this Walmart and then you go look when it was sold and look at the cameras and boom. Suspect found. If all it takes is a $10 pre paid phone to combat the NSA then damn. They need to use their brains a little bit. 
PS. Idk what simswap, or whatever the fuck you said in the last part opsec? About stealing BTC. Maybe that's what the OP did. What did you do to get swatted? Who you pissoff?
