isn't that actually a good thing (serious question)... I mean, so in our lifetime the majority of coins will be mined, so that should mean within those 25 years the price will continue to rise until people realize that the last .1 million will take another 100 years to exist.  At that point it should be worth close to it's maximum value, Is that logic sound?  I will admit in advance that I could be wrong.

I have always used 2FA, but I haven't used my account in almost a year.

He's paying with Buttcoin 
@_date: 2017-08-02 14:34:56
are there really Litecoin "users"?  I have held LTC for years and never "used" it in any capacity, I guess that goes for all my alts... the issue I have with crypto in general is how many different coins do we really need?  Why does there need to be over 1000 different forms of it?

This..."Even in Bitcoin's infancy, there is already an elite class that will undoubtedly grow evermore powerful if BTC matures"
this is basically what my question is about.  Wouldn't the majority of the world (who are not yet involved in crypto, and cannot afford a single BTC) choose to just create a new coin and start fresh instead of fighting that elite class?
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:15:00
me too bro, that is exactly where I am right now
@_date: 2013-12-08 02:10:46
Is that advert a link to BTC-e?
@_date: 2013-12-12 13:32:28
thats good advice, thanks!!
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:53:00
Maybe you could add a form to allow users to suggest bet ideas
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:49:51
Nice work, good job getting over 1000 likes in just a few days.  
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:42:05
Fair enough. I do watch them all, I was asking the question hoping for some insight.  I would like to know how day traders setup their charts for their trades.  I am not ready for trading, I am trying to educate myself so I can have a better understanding of how to watch the movements of the market from the perspective of a day trader.
@_date: 2018-12-06 00:26:40
This is pretty cool, might have to get a new screen to keep it up all the time 
@_date: 2013-12-08 06:31:37
just curious, did you pay Facebook to promote the page, or did you invite a lot of your friends, or did all of those people somehow just find and "like" your page?  Over 1000 in a few days is great.
@_date: 2013-12-02 17:36:47
what do the blue and gold lines each represent?  Thanks!
@_date: 2013-12-11 04:54:21
I wish these scam sites would just disappear.  Who in the hell would sell a BTC for $600?  Or a LTC for $17?
@_date: 2013-12-02 16:09:19
you are probably right LOL
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:59:00
Damn right it was shitty, just shows how slowly people adapt to new ideas and technology.  By the time they do we will all be rich!!
@_date: 2013-12-06 23:24:00
Or once they figure out that they can get TONS of campaign money via bitcoin donations they might just embrace it
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:31:04
I thought they made their money with the Coinbase fee (which is 1%).  So for every Bitcoin they sell, they mark it up over 10% and then charge another 1% for their fee? 
@_date: 2013-12-12 05:32:09
I do not trade, I watch.  I would like to learn more.  That is why I asked the question.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:36:53
Fair enough, thanks for the reply.  Does anyone know of a place to buy them that is closer to the actual market value?  I have bought several Bitcoins from Coinbase but their markup seems a little unreasonable to me.
@_date: 2013-11-21 17:38:34
Thanks ComplimentingBot, do you have any advice on Bitcoins?  No?  Then piss off LOL
@_date: 2013-12-08 15:47:08
This is the news we've been waiting for.  This will explode soon!!!
@_date: 2013-12-11 05:02:34
I see, you somehow can predict the future.  
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:01:25
"what the hell does a probability distribution have to do with price? What events are you measuring?"  That was my thought exactly
@_date: 2013-12-11 23:46:52
I am quickly approaching that point also.  I have to remind myself that I have already invested a sizable amount of money but I just want more.  I will never go past the point of spending money I need to survive, but most of my disposable income nowadays goes to Bitcoins and a few altcoins.  I would attribute it to the fact that I love the concept of cryptocurrency, not that I am greedy....  ah fuck it, I am greedy.
