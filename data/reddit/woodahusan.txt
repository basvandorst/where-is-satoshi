Sounds on-topic to me.

How so? Do you mean the SegWit foot dragging?

[Indeed]( the unannounced timing is suspicious.
I was expecting the non-segwit adoption to be your argument, but you've given me an alternative viewpoint to consider and not called me a troll, thanks.

I think it's mostly a reddit thing, and that most people are so divided between r/bitcoin and r/btc that challenging almost anyone will result in being called a shill and troll for the other "team".
I mostly call out r/btc'ers on their nonsense and they seem to believe I'm on the blockstream payroll and am a professional provocateur (they're a sensitive bunch). But then when I challenge the general r/bitcoin sentiment they say I'm a troll because I've posted in r/btc.
I'm summary, online communication sucks and there's loads of dickheads out there you never knew existed.

But what's good for Brian personally is not necessarily what is best for Coinbase, which has [many investors]( who will be exerting control on business decisions.
How the business is run is not necessarily a reflection of Brian's personal position.

I would be inclined to say that was a bit speculative, but the BCH launch was a fucking shambles.
I'd told r/btc peeps that I'd be surprised if BCH got full trading, (especially before new year) as doing a release that big, that close to Christmas when it hasn't even been announced would be ridiculous. But lo and behold they did, and it was a fucking joke.

At this point, it's probably cheaper to put in a low fee and pay a miner directly to accelerate it.

Lets see what they say

There is no valid or invalid, there are just chains that people choose or choose not to use. The "valid" chain is the one you choose to use.

Not FUD at all. Fees increase the friction in transacting, the higher the fees the higher the friction, which will result in less liquidity.

Bitcoin isn't for transactions?
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:48:35
Not if you're using a segwit wallet with bech32 addresses, like electrum 3.

Also, look at [this graph]( then [this one](
All looking *very* familiar.

I'll do what I like thank you very much. It doesn't matter what crypto was intended for, people will use it for whatever they want and that is none of your business.
