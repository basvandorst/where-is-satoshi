Bitcoin is too dangerous and too easy to lose for the average person to use it.

Blockchain.info showed the BTC in my wallet balance.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:52:25
I lost $5000 on blockchain.info due to their shitty system and website. And I didn't lose my private key. It was never saved/synced, thanks to flaw in their site.
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:15:28
You don't understand how Bitcoin works, apparently.  That is a newbie question.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:42:52
I'm in the same boat, but I'm assuming they closed our margined short positions and considering a margin short borrows BTC, I don't know if we would be responsible for the lost BTC we borrowed or the lender.  It may not even matter if they are bankrupt. I wish we had some clarity.  But I would say the chances of our short positions still being open are extremely small.
@_date: 2016-08-22 02:23:13

Maybe you don't want to buy with credit and would prefer to pay cash.  So suddenly, you aren't allowed to buy anything $400 or $500 or more, because you money can be stolen from you at anytime by agents of the gov't.   That's the way it is and that's one of the reasons why Bitcoin is good.   However, many reasons why Bitcoin is bad and not going into those here but you made a point of why it is awesome.

Notice how Bitcoins are described as "digital tokens" on Bitfinex's website..not as currency.   That is not by accident.

There aren't a lot of reasons to use credit cards 0% of the time, but there are a lot of reasons not to use them 100% of the time.
And I never said civil asset forfeiture affects "most" people.  But all people are at risk of having their assets seized through it at any time that they have a few hundred dollars on them.
I never said cash was "high risk" or that life is unlivable in any circumstance.  Wow, you are really into the straw men here.  Would have been better if you responded to what I wrote and not the voices in your head.
But cash is higher risk than acceptable in some circumstances.  And there is some risk in some circumstances with cash and near zero with Bitcoin.
But I know that anything other than black or white view of things doesn't work for you.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:45:11
People have money on exchanges to trade and to make more money with trading. I know many people don't understand this or want to accept this but good traders can double or triple their money in short periods of time.  The main risk is the exchange going under but there's not a good way to avoid that risk.

@_date: 2016-08-05 02:07:09
Yes just terrible bad timing luck on your part.  A smart strategy would have been to move 1/4 of your funds to Finex and sell them for USD and then short the equivalent amount of your Bitcoin holdings.  That would have protected you from a price decline, without risking all your funds on Finex.
@_date: 2016-08-04 02:34:08
Just keep in mind that if you spread losses around to everyone, you are going to lose pretty much everyone as customers and going to have to start over from scratch, and with a sullied reputation.
If just some customers take a hit (and perhaps you can repay them over time), then many of the rest will stick with you.  Got to think your security measures will be improved 1000% after this.  
@_date: 2016-08-22 11:57:39


Working for who to do what?
It's not working for those who need what ETH or XMR offers.  And I don't care if anyone out there thinks BTC is "better" than ETH or XMR.  I'm not such a simpleton to say it is better or worse.  But it doesn't offer what those coins do and others have more features that BTC doesn't have (and also ETH and XMR perhaps don't have).
@_date: 2016-08-05 18:36:11
Yeah it won't have any impact on the market at all, so why bother.

I never suggested anything about whether or not Bitcoin works as intended or not.  You have too much of an agenda to discuss this with..constructing straw men already.
@_date: 2016-08-05 02:09:29
If you short BTC, then you don't hold any BTC.  Unless of course you have BTC balance in your account.  When you margin short, you borrow the BTC and it is sold on the market instantly.  That BTC is owned by someone else and you just have to replace it at a later date by buying it on the open market.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:06:25
You need to at least throw the socialized loss victims a bone, so they don't sue you into oblivion and bankruptcy.  Give them a share of future profits to make up for their loss and/or free commissions on the site.... or something.
Even if takes years, at least some hope of returning most or all of the loses would go a long way.
And I personally have paid 3x the amount of commissions with Bitfinex as I've potentially lost with this situation so I would probably make that up in a couple of years if that was an option.
If you don't do this, the USD lenders are definitely going to sue.  I don't see any possible way that they wouldn't.  There may be no way to avoid that either way but at least if you give them something extra, might be a chance.

Bitcoin pumpers desperately scared BTC will lose top spot with darknetmarkets. I think bitcoin fungibility should be on the top of core developers priority list.
Anyway yes I agree but will probably never happen.  If simple blocksize increase cannot occur, then forget about a major change like that.
Bitcoin was great in 2010, but it's been eclipsed by technological breakthroughs and innovation since then. It has fallen behind and may never catch up.  It's crypto market share will just continue to bleed.

And try to get more sleep if you can. I know easier said that done but the body (and brain) can only function so well when sleep deprived.
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:55:55
Of course you could do that.  If you can settle short margin positions (which involve buying BTC on the market), then you can buy BTC on the market when you have verified it is the account holder who is authorizing it and only to the previous locked BTC address for that account.
For many of us, we still do not have access to our funds if you bring the site up and only allow USD wire withdrawls.  I know you are working on it, but anything you can do to expedite us having access to our funds would be great.  Thank you.

Sort of like Bitcoin, huh?
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:05:37
No you sent USD to Bitfinex, who stores it in their partner banks.  The USD is in a bank.  It is not held by Bitfinex, and it is not a digital token in a ledger on an exchange, like BTC is.  BTC is on the blockchain.  USD is in a bank.

Yes maybe too late, but you can do that on other exchanges like BTC-e, as well. Or you can short futures on BitMEX or OKCoin and do it that way with even less BTC risked on the exchange.
@_date: 2016-08-05 17:48:31
Yes please.  It is taking up a lot of our time sitting in front of the computer, monitoring this and time is money so we are losing more money.  If you at least give us some notice as to when the site will be going back or the next announcement, we can get other work done. Thank you.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:28:47

@_date: 2016-08-04 02:54:56
They are going to get sued for negligence either way.  There's most likely no way to avoid that.  So they may as well take a course of action that will lead to them retaining more customers, so they can at least have a chance of surviving and become an obscenely profitable company again.  And if they can try to pay back those with account losses over time, then that could be the best way to go.
@_date: 2016-04-10 20:47:30

Just like any marketplace, there are honest and dishonest people on Paxful.  If you are trading Bitcoin for Amazon gift cards on there, then just make sure the person has a cash receipt and don't assume the worst.
Paxful is mostly Backpage chicks trading gift cards so they can pay for their ads.   So most of the people on there are not scammers and the people who run the site certainly aren't scammers.  I haven't heard them being accused of that by anyone but you.

Of course it's possible.   
@_date: 2016-08-05 16:41:54
If you don't get the exchange back up, isn't there anyway that requests could be made via email and you could buy BTC on the open market with our USD balance and withdraw to our locked BTC withdrawl address?
I have no plans to get verified on the site, yet I would like my funds back, at least until this is all sorted out more and then will still trade on Bitfinex some in the future, if possible.

Ok but what is the estimate based on?   If it is wildly inaccurate than better not to even try it.
@_date: 2016-04-26 16:28:39
No I don't have any BTC in Mycelium. Was just trying to spend from my cold storage.  It shows the correct public key for the private key that I scanned but says there is 0 BTC in there.  And with every account I try.
I had to go to Blockchain.info (which I can't stand) and import my private key in there.  That worked, so it's definitely a Mycelium issue.

But it's ok, because "You can't outlaw Bitcoin".  You can outlaw every way to buy or trade or mine it, but you can't stop the protocol.

Some combination of the above.

I believe in Bitcoin because I own some and I don't think I'm imagining it.  But am skeptical of headlines about % increase in BTC sales, because seen many times when it is very low real numbers.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:05:12
At least you computer (or phone) can't be hacked and your physical gold stolen.
@_date: 2016-03-26 14:19:32
If "we all being using it", then means hardly anyone will be using it because almost no one uses bitcoin. And openbazaar probably won't change that much, although it would be great if it did.
@_date: 2016-03-24 19:14:27
You are wrong.  It is totally morally justfied.  The Lord Jesus would agree... Santa would too.  Because it's logical and correct.
@_date: 2017-03-05 01:30:27
At this rate, there will 50 companies accepting BTC by the year 2150....great progress!
BTC has failed in the merchant adoption area.  No way around that.  I remember in 2013 and everyone was saying Bitcoin would take the world by storm in this area.  Nope, it never happened and has been a major disappointment.
@_date: 2017-03-05 16:11:21
Not surpriising that you find the truth and facts to be "pathetic".
@_date: 2017-03-01 03:14:33
Bitcoiners are notoriously poor at math.
@_date: 2016-03-20 08:41:27
Yes the amount of time I have been on reddit certainly has a huge correlation with your IQ score. Thank you for further proving my point.
@_date: 2017-03-07 02:31:04
I never knew there were so many scammers and thieves in the world until I got into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-03-27 12:28:42
Yes should be fine.  You can also just format hard drive and do clean install of Windows on any computer.
I use paperwallet/cold storage for all my BTC with bitaddress.org offline generator.  I disagree with some of the others that hardware wallet is better.
Hardware wallet is hardware.  It is physical item that can be stolen or lost or damaged and it is proof that you own some BTC.
Cold storage (if you don't print it out) "paper" wallets can be encrypted and copied and put in multiple locations with whatever filename you want.  So no one knows you have BTC, much less can steal it.  (And I know stealing your hardware wallet doesn't mean the person steals the BTC.)
So downloading the bitaddress.org files from Github and doing it on clean, offline computer is the way to go, imo. I usually spend from my cold storage with Mycelium app.

Enjoy the wait.
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:39:41
No way this will pass...a friggin amendment.  No way.  0.1% chance.
@_date: 2017-02-20 06:18:49
unlikely it's anything but regulation and fears of more of it.
@_date: 2017-02-11 00:07:22
The same evidence that they added 100K in 2 days, which is none.
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:06:49
OP bought at $800 and desperate to get his money back...but it is gone, gone, gone.
@_date: 2016-03-13 01:52:38
This is really bad news, because means that Bitcoin and other crypto coins are totally on the radar and important to the highest levels of US gov't.
And only takes a swipe of the pen to make them just about as illegal as they are in Russia right now...or China for that matter.
@_date: 2017-02-10 22:07:54
PBOC didn't spread "FUD". They made a ruling that is bad for BTC and its market price.
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:54:07


You are absolutely wrong.  You either have a terrible memory or you weren't here at the time and just making things up.
@_date: 2017-03-10 01:27:50
Yes 74% increase.  From $100 per year to $174 per year, most likely.
@_date: 2016-03-22 19:30:04
It's called:  self defense.
@_date: 2017-03-09 04:47:44
Of course if ETF isn't approved, you are better off selling now and buying back more BTC at a lower price for the same amount of money.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:57:48
He also said something about it being bad because it is semi-anonymous and can be used for drug purchases..something like that.  He certainly isn't overly positive about it, publicly.
Yes there is the same % of Bitcoin supporters and it is very low %.
@_date: 2017-02-28 10:22:13
You are clueless about what I said. You have your own goofy agenda, unrelated to the conversation so go for it with your soliloquy.
@_date: 2016-03-17 05:30:01
Not exactly. When you lose your debit card, you still have the IOU that the bank will probably honor and give you your money back.  However, there's no guarantee they will give it back to you.  With Bitcoin, it's there and only you can access it.
 
Of course there's a chance of massive 51% attack that could screw up the entire network and drop the value of your BTC, but I don't see a way to break encryption and steal it from you if you have it secured properly.
@_date: 2017-03-05 22:47:32
What I find pathetic is people with simpleton brains and poor reading comprension.  I didn't comment at all on the technology behind Bitcoin.  You are a bore with your own boring agenda that no one cares about.  
@_date: 2017-03-05 00:40:21
Good question.  That never occurred to me.  I suppose it's the same situation as if you had cash in your house and more than one person lives there.
@_date: 2017-03-05 09:14:49


Not when it is less than 1% of their sales.  And when you say "the major companies", there is just a handful of them.  It really is a laughably pathetic low number.   You have to be in full Bitcoin delusional mode to not recognize that.
@_date: 2016-03-26 15:07:53
It's probably because CONbase has f*cked over so many of us in the past that we jump to upvote another one of their screwups/scams so more people will be aware.
@_date: 2017-02-12 17:00:08
Pay attention to the current price and market conditions and you will probably sell them a long time before 2045.
@_date: 2017-03-02 02:53:08
Odd non sequitur and not sure what you are talking about, but pretty sure that I don't care.
@_date: 2016-03-24 04:53:38
Nope the dude threatened to out him which would put him in prison for life.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:49:42
They are behaving like that because they aren't 100% selfish assholes who only care about the BTC price going up and absolutely nothing else.
@_date: 2017-03-04 08:47:06
Yes he is pretty dumb and just defending gold at all costs. Of course plenty of the people in the Bitcoin space do the same with talking nonsense and defending BTC, but they are all equally as dumb and incorrect.
@_date: 2016-03-25 20:07:53
Sadly I am not surprised to hear this.  CONbase hsa terrible customer support and I have had them debit money out of my checking acct twice, for the same BTC purchase, causing an overdraft fee.  Then I had to wait about 6 weeks for them to fix it.
I haven't used them in a couple of years but sounds like they are as bad as ever.
@_date: 2017-03-02 00:51:25


That's clearly all he cares about, which is fine, but he basically disregards the possibility that anyone else could possible care about anything else, which makes him dumb and/or extremely egocentric.
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:16:25
Yes it's amazing how poorly BTC has done with merchant adoption.
@_date: 2016-03-29 01:40:57
Ok for some odd reason, I couldn't read your mind and was responding to what you wrote and not what in your head.
@_date: 2017-03-05 03:54:33


What a pathetic straw man.  You are pathetic.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:41:18
Again, why would they lobby for Bitcoin?   The banks would be lobbying for their competition  The status quo is what allows the 1% to steal money from everyone else so effectively (well that and the dumbfuck poor Republican voters).  They aren't going to risk upsetting that balance.
@_date: 2016-06-09 01:25:11
I don't have a list of articles right in front of me, but there has already been a lot of regulations. Russia banned BTC, China banned making purchases with BTC, the USA has a lot of regulations and will have more.  It's amazing how many bitcoin enthusiasts minimize the impact of all this and just assume it won't get worse over time.
All you need is a false flag terrorist attack with Bitcoin was used as part of it, and they can come down even harder and 99% of the general public won't care.
@_date: 2017-03-05 07:49:05
Bill Gates didn't endorse Bitcoin that I ever heard.  And a low % of the 1% are strong Bitcoin supporters.  A very low %...below 5%.  Probably below 1%.
I know the CEO of Overstock is a Bitcoin champion.  He's a cool guy, but he's an anomaly in this instance.
@_date: 2016-06-09 00:10:26
It's a question because the governments of the world have already fucked with Bitcoin hard and if this is implemented, you better pray for some lube because going to get it harder and faster.
@_date: 2017-03-02 05:13:32
Yes the gold bugs see BTC as an insignficant gnat, buzzing around their heads.
@_date: 2016-06-09 14:37:32
Yes this is a huge advertisement for why Bitcoin is so awesome. They can take your cash and your bank balances, but probably not your bitcoin, especially if they don't even know it exists.  All hail BTC.
@_date: 2016-06-29 18:35:36
Coinbase is terrible.  They always screw their customers over.
@_date: 2017-01-19 18:21:06
Because it's not Bitcoin, of course.  None of those other deserve to exist.
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:25:57
They can make it difficult to impossible to move fiat to and from internet gaming sites.  They can't make it difficult to impossible to move Bitcoin from internet gaming sites.
@_date: 2017-01-14 14:48:22
I just answered your question above.
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:57:05
Yes 35% drop was a "baby " dump.  The level of denial is high with this one.
@_date: 2017-01-18 12:32:20

He sold at $300. The bottom was $170.  He sold at 76% higher price than the bottom.
@_date: 2017-01-09 17:09:12
So from 2 shops to 9.2, most likely.
And yes I see the numbers below, but I suspect some of those "shops" are people selling trinkets online.

looking really really bad
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:24:32
Nope, the high in 2013 was no more artificial than the one today.  You had the willy bot contributing a little too it back then and now you have rampant organized manipulation of the price.  I would say the price back then was more "organic" than the one now, or at least it's a close race.
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:13:27
I was being sarcastic.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:26:56
Well this one has a better headline.
@_date: 2016-06-17 04:11:52
We will see more and more of these posts by bagholders who did a terrible trade but maybe got lucky in the end.  Athough watch them hold down to $200 again.
@_date: 2017-01-02 10:11:53
Of course there has been some manipulation in the market over the past few weeks and months.
@_date: 2016-06-09 19:06:20
It said the link hadn't been submitted but s'ok and a dupe is ok with a story like this that more people need to see.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 09:18:48
Sorry but it's no longer 2013.  Bitcoin merchant adoption has already failed.
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:28:22
Yes you do.  You all think alike and 100% of you agree that gambling is bad.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:54:05
It's about time....long overdue.
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:17:23
Your reading comprehension leaves much to be desired.k
@_date: 2017-01-15 01:08:24
Of course I'm most likely right.  I don't have magical omniscient powers, but US population is many times that of Japan and also haven't heard of any huge surge in Japanese Bitcoin trading volumes before, it most likely never happened.
@_date: 2017-01-13 22:26:24
The Jesus freaks don't like that and I'm sure there are other reasons that the money is not going to the right people in power.
@_date: 2017-01-04 22:52:50
Traders have their coins on an exchange to trade with.  And that's why they have more Bitcoin than you do.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:05:24
You just screwed up and allowed a scammer to take advantage of you and steal your money.  You probably won't get it back unless they are really dumb.  And I've made dumb mistakes with Bitcoin too, so not ragging on you, but just saying that people should really research LBC risks befor selling on there. Some methods are riskier than others, and even cash deposit has gotten reversed before and people have their bank accounts closed.
@_date: 2017-01-13 04:49:16


Chinese gov't officials laugh at you.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:05:23
Yes same here and I get the downvotes too.
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:22:30
He and his Republican buddies will rape and plunder the country even more than GWB and his cronies did...and that says a lot.
@_date: 2017-01-13 11:12:28
Is this sort of like when the people who are long bitcoins spam posts many threads to get people to FOMO and buy?
@_date: 2017-01-23 00:20:30
I think maybe you backpeddled on how long the break even point is for your mining equipment, because you weren't even taking the difficulty increase into account and that is major.
And of course any Bitcoin related posts are fine in the Bitcoin sub.  A lot of people commented in that thread, so it is fine.
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:16:43
Because the employees wouldn't have the private key to send anything.
@_date: 2017-01-17 13:42:21
Yes not sure what your point was, but yes that was a few days ago.
@_date: 2017-01-03 08:13:32
Yes I suppose he could have sold at $475 instead and then bought back below $200.   
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:15:05
You must be kidding.  So you don't think an undercover FBI agent would go into the marijuana dispensary and buy some weed with Bitcoin and throw the owners and employees in a cold, dark cell for a few years?  
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:57:52


Ok then enjoy your special book, while everyone else uses the term "bubble" correctly, in an investing and trading context.
@_date: 2017-01-20 08:15:56
So you think that would work?  They would just outlaw that the very next day.
@_date: 2017-01-20 11:23:36




The guy lies all day and all night. Why do you believe what he "states".
Try harder.
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:46:51
Not true. There are thousands of successful trades by other payment methods every day on LBC where both parties are happy. Some are riskier than others.  Cash in person has its risks too, for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-27 06:04:57
Mycelium is pretty easy to use..what are you talking about.  I wouldn't recommend BitcoinQT to anyone because takes weeks to download the blockchain and even get started.
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:51:48
It's interesting that a bundle of a hundred 100 bolivares is selling for about $75 on ebay, when the currency value is just about $2.
@_date: 2017-01-13 05:46:31
It goes without saying that this would be good for crypto and Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:49:07
Yes I agree, but I don't know how the community is going to make tha that happen.
@_date: 2017-01-02 04:23:22
World leaders and their .01% backers (bosses) aren't going to let fiat currency go without a fight. And you are talking about many of the most evil and ruthless people on the planet who are going to be fighting Bitcoin.  It isn't going to be pretty, for sure.
@_date: 2016-12-09 04:41:26
No they aren't cashing in on the drop from $1100 to $160 right now.  But every time the price drops a significant amount, of course traders are profiting.
@_date: 2016-12-15 15:24:26
Somehow I suspect that the people who don't believe in math and science have the lower IQ.  Also the morons who can only chant "USA" and "Lock her up" over and over.  Not to mention that you seem them interviewed and they are clearly dumb as dirt.  And also they are usually Jesus freaks, and very low IQ comes along with that.
@_date: 2016-11-24 16:42:50
They did ban most of their current cash out there...they made it worthless very soon.  An yes then can ban gold imports.  One gold coin smuggled across the border doesn't mean that a ban isn't in effect.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:28:33
You are off by a few decades but whatever.
@_date: 2016-12-17 21:52:23
I'm surprised there is a legal Bitcoin exchange there that has not been shut down..and that works with the banks too.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:49:18
Common sense is the proof.
@_date: 2017-01-22 23:45:22
He was probably telling the truth, unless he's a pathological liar.
But why do you care that much if he was being honest or not?   It really didn't sound like a big operation anyway.   And he backpeddled on some of his claims.
@_date: 2016-12-17 04:02:28
Not quite 3 year but close enough.....yes very cool and I never thought we would see this again after going sub 200 a few times.  I gave up hope but glad it turned out ok.
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:14:16
What a boring non-sequitur that is.
@_date: 2016-12-09 14:02:56


That's great...but they still didn't profit from the drop from $1100 to $160 after they closed their position.
@_date: 2016-12-17 21:04:28
How do they convert the BTC to food?   
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:04:29
And the higher the "1 BTC" price goes, the more it turns people off to getting into it, because they figure they can't afford it.  Yes they can buy a fraction, but it's still a turn off.
@_date: 2016-12-30 01:00:39
And also most people aren't going to trust "imaginary" digital money vs the piece of paper with dead Presidents printed on it.  But perhaps over time, a few more will get on.
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:01:21
Yeah I can't read the whole story either.  I tried to google a non-pay link, but couldn't find it but was still worth sharing the news/headline...and maybe someone can copy/paste the entire article in here.
@_date: 2016-12-14 22:58:40
Yes average IQ of Trump supporter is about 85 and avg IQ of Bitcoiner is about 105, so not sure if they are compatible.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:57:22
I'm not going to repeat myself, but it's all above.  Either you get it or you don't.  And if you think that law enforcement efforts hasn't cut down on the number of Bittorrent users, then you are delusional.
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:09:11
I didn't take that way.  You sound rather petty and envious and projecting your own poor character onto OP.
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:06:19
is a joke because the moderators there are a joke.  But yes they are so scared and insecure that any mention of altcoins is not allowed. 
And btw, Bitcoin is up 100% this year in market price.  
@_date: 2017-01-13 23:28:42
Ok so doesn't change one thing that I said.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:09:00
Yes banks are still the best for most people and most uses/transactions.  If I had to choose between only using Bitcoin or banks/credit cards, of course I would choose the latter.  However, can use both and Bitcoin is great for a few things...not so much for people in the USA and UK, etc but for developing countries and those that are getting f*cked hard by their gov't (India, Venezuela, and many others).
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:07:06
Not to mention the bank can steal your money and the government surely can seize it.
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:02:01
I'm surprised they aren't burning the capitol building down, considering what they've been through and this latest attack on their lives.
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:09:38
And so it begins.... and the end won't be pretty.
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:46:33
Your point is that you can't kill the protocol.  I never said anything about being able to kill it or not kill it.   Obviously, you cannot, and I guess that will give you great solace as you rot in prison.
@_date: 2016-12-30 18:02:08
There was a push to make mBTC the standard and it failed.
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:03:11


Yes of course it it is, but Bitcoin forums are the place to come for bad investing advice.  They said the same thing "Hold" all the way down from $1100 to $200.
Meanwhile those who ignored them have 5x as much money right now because they sold and bought back much cheaper.
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:09:25
They have to be careful they don't push it too far or they will kill the goose that killed the golden egg.  Look what happened to digg.com or whatever it was called..the big competitor to reddit that shot itself in the food and everyone left and never came back.
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:16:26
Yes Bitcoin's growth can be smothered.  Actually it has already been slowed down tremendously by laws and regulations.  
@_date: 2016-12-28 05:59:26


Fixed that for you, although I realize you can't deal with the truth.
@_date: 2016-12-30 02:48:39
Nope, 99% of people wouldn't vote, based on Bitcoin agenda.
@_date: 2016-12-15 23:04:19
There's not necessarily a way to prevent this from happening. Some of it is just a weakness built into the system that can't really be avoided very easily...certainly not with 100% success.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:06:15
You do realize that most people can barely operate a mouse or do basic functions on their phone.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:00:57
And it's not like it's rare that happens. I've had thousands of $s worth of BTC lost/hacked in the last three years from Gox, Bitfinex, and Blockchain.info.   And I'm pretty careful with my security procedures..as much as I can be.  I didn't leave funds on Gox and Bitfinex, but was actively trading the.  Blockchain.info just f*cked me, although I learned from that experience to never send funds to one of your addresses if you don't already have the private key written down.  Don't trust any website or exchange any more than you need to.
@_date: 2016-12-17 16:03:44
You don't get it because you didn't think BTC could ever drop below $800.
@_date: 2016-12-09 05:55:36
So someone who won a $5 bet on a football game in 1973 is profiting from that right now because Bitcoin is going up?    That is a nonsense non sequitur, but if that's how your brain works, then good for you.
@_date: 2016-12-18 06:58:19
Marketcap all time high is pretty much now.

It is very effective to spend from cold storage.  I use Mycelium Android app to do it all the time.

Yeah I get that the truth hurts.
@_date: 2016-12-23 03:08:25
You posted something factually incorrect and glad that someone corrected you.
@_date: 2016-12-17 18:54:26
Ummm...yes.  Have them install a Bitcoin wallet on their phone or computer and then send them the Bitcoin. It's that simple.
Personally I prefer paper wallets made from Bitaddress.org, so you can go that route if you want but it's slightly more complicated for most people.
@_date: 2016-12-29 23:59:06
Yeah like banks are going to go along with that and encourage their own demise.  
@_date: 2017-01-20 17:03:21
no sh*t

Doubtful this is true. Sounds like a total bullsh*t claim.

Dec. 16, 2016 7:51 p.m. ET MARACAIBO, Venezuela—Desperate and cashless Venezuelans, angry that the government hasn’t exchanged their voided bank notes as officials had pledged, on Friday rose up in protest with some scattered looting of stores.
National Guard troops were deployed to put down the unrest that broke out as far west as this large city near the Colombian border and in smaller towns in the east. With only nine days to go before Christmas, Venezuelans grappling with a collapsing economy and soaring inflation are left without money after President Nicolás Maduro in a sudden move this week banned the 100-bolivar note, the country’s largest denomination. Only the Central Bank now accepts the remaining bills—and only until Tuesday.
“Maduro is making a mockery of the people, and he has destroyed Christmas for all Venezuelans,” said Desiré Chávez, a 33-year-old clothing vendor in Maracaibo who had accepted the 100-bolivar notes until Thursday. “Now I don’t know what I’ll do because that cash is useless and my kids are hungry.”
Here, the central bank office didn’t open Friday for the exchange officials had been promised. Troops turned away nearly 1,500 people who had lined up starting Thursday night to turn in their useless bills, prompting angry mobs to block traffic and riot. Dozens were arrested.
Mr. Maduro gave his countrymen only days to turn in the 100-bolivar notes, which are worth only a few U.S. cents. Until this week, it was the nation’s most widely used bank note.
“There have and will be difficulties while we overcome this situation,” Mr. Maduro said in a televised speech Friday. He called the measure necessary to combat alleged currency speculators in neighboring Colombia and elsewhere that he blames for his country’s economic troubles. “I appreciate the people of Venezuela’s understanding, awareness, all of its support.”
New 500-bolivar bills that Mr. Maduro had said would circulate this week have yet to be distributed, causing panic, because more than a third of Venezuela’s 30 million people lack a bank account.
Those lucky enough to line up at the central bank headquarters in the capital, Caracas, were able to at least deposit their money. They were given IOUs and told they could pick up the new bills when they are ready.
“I don’t have a bank account, and they need to tell me what I do with this money,” said Ana Garza, a 58-year-old cake vendor from a Caracas slum who had been waiting since 5:30 a.m. in a line that stretched 18 city blocks on Friday. She only had money for a bus ride because no one is accepting the 100-bolivar bills anymore.
“I don’t have words for this measure from Maduro,” griped bus driver Ricardo Salas, 54. “How do you get rid of these bills without the new ones arriving? Buying groceries is going to be horrible.”
On Thursday, the central bank had received at least one shipment of new 500-bolivar bills, according to one person familiar with the matter. But it would take weeks for enough 500-bolivar bills to be available to alleviate the scarcity of cash.
Without money, residents in the southeastern state of Bolivar blocked the only major highway in the region that connects the country to Brazil. Nearly 40 businesses, mostly grocery stores, were ransacked around the state.
“This has gone from a riot over discontent and hunger to vandalism,” said Erick Leiva, head of a local business chamber.
Mr. Maduro this week also temporarily closed the border with neighboring Colombia to crack down on currency speculation along the border, which he blames for the free-falling value of the bolivar. Economists say the government’s feverish printing of money and price controls are the cause.
The desperation was palpable for people like Daniel Morales, 28, a street vendor in Maracaibo.
“I have an 11-day-old baby and I haven’t been able to buy diapers, nor milk,” he said. All of the bills that Mr. Morales had taken to the central bank branch to exchange added up to 20,000 bolivars, or less than $9. A pack of diapers costs more.

That was already tried, and if failed miserably. But perhaps another attempt in the future.
@_date: 2016-12-28 10:06:44
Tell that to the owners of Pirate Bay and Kickass Torrents who were thrown in prison.   
But I'm sure they were happy about it because "you can't kill Bittorrent". 
@_date: 2016-12-28 11:15:19


They aren't too minor to the people in prison.
And I never said Bitcoin would fail, nor did I imply it.   I would never be so dumb as to just say "Bitcoin will fail" or "Bitcoin will succeed", because it has already failed and succeeded in many ways and that will not change.
I didn't imply anything at all, despite your overactive imagination.
@_date: 2016-12-28 23:29:16
Already have succeeded.  And some bad luck and good luck involved, but way ahead after three years and hundreds of trades.
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:22:11
It will be so, so easy too.  Just have a terrorist attack (real or false flag manufactured) use Bitcoin as part of its funding, and then tell the public FOR THEIR SAFETY and THE SAFETY OF THEIR CHILDREN, Bitcoin and crypto must pretty much be banned, regulated the point of effectively banning it.  
Pretty much everyone will go along with it, no votes will be lost by those who pass the measures and the police will happily enforce another unjust law.   
It's almost inevitable and just not sure how big Bitcoin will have to get before they put the hammer down.
Then Bitcoin will become close to a 100% black market currency. It will be like trading heroin or automatic weapons or prescription drugs or whatever else you aren't allowed to do above board.  But it will discourage new adopters and that won't be great for the price.
@_date: 2016-11-15 12:27:08
Yes but it's "importance" is trending downwards over time, so I guess it's becoming less important:
@_date: 2016-12-27 06:03:59
It's not going to change.  Humanity is largely filled with corrupt pieces of shit and also a lot of low IQ morons.
@_date: 2016-12-28 04:00:46
LOL.  Yeah, like the central banking system and everyone who benefits from it is going to sit and that happen.  Bitcoin will be regulated first and if that doesn't work, Bitcoiners will be fined and prosecuted, or will just get dragged out of their beds, kicking and screaming in the middle of the night, never to be seen again.
But dream your little utopian fantasies if they help you get through the day.
@_date: 2016-12-09 04:59:31
You are totally wrong.  They cashed in when they covered their short at 160. If they didn't even short at $1100+, then they didn't profit from the drop.   If they bought at $160, then they profited from the rise since then, not from any price action before their purchase.
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:14:36
Not from CNN...from reality.  And I don't care what your IQ is, but probably is pretty low if you don't know what "average" means.
@_date: 2016-12-17 04:02:47
Unfortunately yes...probably eventually.
@_date: 2016-12-27 06:03:01
No they steal your money in other ways.  Conbase is bad, but yes at least they didn't lose all your money, or 1/3 of it like Bitfinex did.
@_date: 2016-12-28 06:54:55
It will go just fine...the police in Venezuela haven't quit and walked off the job.  
You have some very smart, ruthless, wealthy people who run things.  They aren't going to let Bitcoin creep up on them and threaten worldwide banking.  It's just not going to happen.  Bitcoin will be smothered in its crib, for the most part.
So I view it more as a trading vehicle than a long-term investment.  Unfortunately, I think the music will stop eventually.  I really hope I'm wrong though and will be thrilled if this never comes to pass. 
@_date: 2016-12-08 18:06:40
Einstein wouldn't say something so patently stupid. Price went from $1100 to $160.  That is a very impressive short, and some people did cash in on it.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:05:11
yeah like the gov'ts of the world are going to allow that to happen.  If it gets to 5%, they will start hanging Bitcoiners in the public square.  That will slow consumer adoption rate considerably.
@_date: 2016-12-30 00:03:34
And as the recent US election has shown, about half the people out there ain't too bright...or downright dumb.  Although a lot of smart people still need to get into BTC. I was talking to my sister who has 6 figure job and graduate degree, etc and she said she still doesn't really "get" the whole digital currency thing.  She really doesn't have a reason to research it though and I'm sure many other people like this.
It's going to take a major financial crisis and hyperinflation and perhaps negative interest rates to get significantly more US residents interested.  However there's still the rest of the world and Venezuelans and Indians and many others are very motivated at this point.
@_date: 2016-12-28 08:37:12


No they didn't really care about that..they probably made money from it in the end.


Good example and they are each less valuable than they would be without constant attack on them.  There are less files on Bittorrent and sites get shut down and the owners thrown in prison.  But great analogy if you think that's cool.
@_date: 2016-12-15 04:16:12
The source is common sense, which you are clearly lacking.
@_date: 2016-12-18 00:45:19
Highly volatile as in up 80% this year?  When their own currency is down like 95%.
But yes probably smarter to exchange for dollars or euros. However if those aren't available, then BTC is better than what they have.
@_date: 2016-02-25 23:34:28
F CONbase.  They stole money from me and my friends more than one time with their deceptive business practices.   I would buy Bitcoin, and they would take the money out of my account for it.  I had to wait 5 days for them to deliver it to me and then if the price of BTC had gone up in that 5 days, 10 minutes before they were to deliver it to me, they would cancel my order for "security" reasons.   
And to add insult to injury they would debit the money from my checking account twice sometimes, leaving me with overdraft fees.  Then 4 months later, they responded to my customer service inquiry and credited me the amount.
They are evil, they are crooks, they are incompetent and anyone is a fool to do business with them.
And this is only my opinion (so they don't sue me), but google it and you will get LOTs of proof. Here a few:

"Soon" as in ... 20 years from now or never !

This would have happened two years ago if it was going to.  It is a slam dunk for gambling sites, but they don't use BTC for some reason.  I assume it's gov't regulations and those will only get stricter and stricter.
I just made an acct on Nitrogensports site recently and they accept BTC an have heard good things about it.
@_date: 2016-02-26 20:10:02
Yes if it hasn't happened by now, then very low probability will happen anytime soon...and soon being the next two or three years.
@_date: 2017-04-01 19:55:21
So now you are proud that Bitcoin has high fees just like VISA.  How quickly you guys redraw the lines when they don't move in your favor.  
Bitcoin is a FAILURE as far as merchant adoption goes, and that was when the fees were even lower.  Now they are high and it really fails as a payment system on multiple levels.
@_date: 2016-02-24 00:35:53
You are "loving the growth" and also speculating that someone is spamming the network. Make up your mind.  Or maybe you are loving that someone is possibly spamming the network...odd view. but go for it.

He embarrassed law enforcement for far too long.  It was a punitive measure for that.  That's pretty much it.

I couldn't log in last night, but was able to reset my password and then was able to log in and view my claim but couldn't see if it was accepted or rejected.
But today I can't login again and when I do "I forgot my password" and enter my email address or username, it just goes back to the main screen, rather than saying it has sent out a temporary code to change pw.
So I'm locked out of the system for some reason.
@_date: 2016-09-12 01:53:07
That may have been good advice in late 2013 but not now.  The BTC industry is stagnating pretty hard.

@_date: 2016-09-17 16:47:02
Dude pay attention to the original question "Once bitcoin reaches 21,000,000 and there is no more to mine,...".  That doesn't happen in "25 or more years).
And I could be 80 y/o for all you know, so not sure why you think i would definitely see how it turns out in my lifetime.

$20,000 doesn't mean that much.  If you are a billionaire, it isn't that aggressive.  And 90% of what?   Anyway thanks for sharing your story and glad you have some healthy profit right now.
@_date: 2016-09-12 17:06:44
From a consumer point of view, very little is happening.  Bitpay pretty much failed, the exchanges have low volume.  You need consumers of products and services for healthy industry.
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:35:16


yes, but if quantum computing miners started before the next difficulty adjustment they could probably move up the date quite a bit.
But quantum computing will probably kill Bitcoin because it can steal everyone's money.  Supposedly any public key can be hacked to get the private key if you had true quantum computer.
And by "kill" Bitcoin, I don't mean that it won't exist after that. But it will be sufficiently decimated.
@_date: 2016-09-18 06:33:29
So how are you supposed to get funds to an address when if you transfer the funds there, it is going to "publish" the pubic key on the blockchain.  That is what I don't understand.  It seems like quantum computing would allow all private keys to be stolen.
And I am well aware my ignorance here and if it's a stupid quesiton, that's fine but curious what the answer is.
@_date: 2016-09-17 21:34:39
The person who asked that exact question cares and I care that you try to hijack his conversation with your nonsense.
@_date: 2016-10-15 04:14:00
Good point.  I've heard the PCT is mobbed since that movie "Wild" came out.  I really think this would bump the BTC price up a bit....probably somewhat inevitable. I would certainly be buying before opening weekend.
@_date: 2016-10-03 05:27:46
Ok maybe I'm just ignorant in this area.  But I just know that if I send to a new address and look up that address on blockchain.info, then it shows the transaction and I thought the address was the public key.
@_date: 2016-10-15 04:13:14

The only one he left out was child pornography.  That is the other one that they use to demonize anything they don't like.   And I have never heard about bitcoin being used for prostitution.  Maybe there are a couple of high end prostitutes that take it, but would be .0000001% of the market.
@_date: 2016-05-09 23:36:49
Yes well said.  Maybe someone like him or Sanders needs to really f*ck everything up so the system comes crumbling down and then it gets rebuilt in a slightly better state.  Although frankly either of them would not change much because President is not King and other branches of the gov't are still corrupt and will block any meaningful changg.

They have been doing this to customers, going back to 2013.  They did it to me and also cheated me in some other areas, so I closed my account way back then. I don't why people use them still, but I guess not a lot of alternatives.

Because we are barely a gnat buzzing around their head at this point.
@_date: 2016-10-03 05:26:38
Then how do you explain the transaction that funds the public key being on the blockchain.  It's out there and anyone can see it (and crack it with quantum computers)

Coinbase has been fucking over their customers for years.  If they had any formidable competition, they would be gone by now.

Yes No signing in, no sharing info, just scan QR code....and then record the transaction and figure out the cost basis for the BTC you just spent, and save all that for your tax return and do that for every other time you spend bitcoin as well.  When with fiat, you just spend it and Done.

Dude, they are the ones laughing.  It could very well not be a coincidence that the announcement came out when it did to create a bear trap before the rise.
And congrats on Bitcoin going up 20%.  Ethereum is up 2000% in the last few months.

There was no news and no trigger.  It was a plan that was executed on predetermined schedule by deep pocketed individuals, exchanges in collusion, etc.
@_date: 2016-05-04 10:20:36
From my understanding, you need the private key to spend BTC (move them to another address), so to move BTC from the first block, you need the private key for the addresses and that would pretty much prove it was Satoshi.
But have him just create a new address and sent first block BTC there that hasn't moved since 2009 or whenever..seems simple.
@_date: 2016-05-27 21:12:09
Don't need to imagine it. We are already there, in many cases.
@_date: 2016-05-30 12:21:34
Wow...must not have been a very fun two years for you.  Did you buy any more after Dec 2013 or did you give up?
But obviously would have been some awesome trading if you sold all of it when it started to drop from its high.  I can't say I agree on the strategy to buy at $1083 and hold down to $171. I would have taken a loss long, long before then and probably tried to buy back lower. But I make plenty of trading mistakes, some of which you probably don't. Everyone has their weaknesses, except the awesome traders who are millionaires.
Anyway if you haven't bought any since 2013, you aren't a trader anyway.  I know it is mental and mathmatical gymnastics, but nice to see that green in the profit column for sure, so congrats.
@_date: 2016-05-30 06:15:45
Then why aren't you running one, genius.  It's because no one would give you $10, much less more than that to invest in your company, and no one would hire you to run anything more than the fry cooker, and you sure haven't earned enough money to start your own company.  You = loser, Coinbase guy = winner (although evil one).
@_date: 2016-05-28 11:19:24


Yes, agreed that it is slow and gradual.   Slow and gradual doesn't mean huge increase in volume out of nowhere and major spike upwards.

The problem is there is rarely a way to pay the creative people.  If you buy an album or $10, the artist gets $1 of that.  I would rather just torrent it than give $9 to a record company.  If artists had BTC donation info on their website, I would give them a few bucks this way.

At least Hillary probably believes in Climate Change and would make a few more National Parks or Forests.  And of course nominate less maniacs to the Supreme Court.  That's pretty much the main advantages over Trump.

You told me Bitcoin was going to explode in Japan (and everywhere else) back in late 2013.  You were wrong then and probably wrong now.

He's not going to win awards unless he shares some of the revenues with one of the big media companies.  Awards go for generating profits many times, not for artistic accomplishment. See Julia Roberts in Erin Brocovich and many others.

Good timing and you can probably buy them back cheaper in a couple of months.

I don't really care about that, but you wouldn't know it to be true if it was and it wouldn't change a thing.

But Backpage only takes Bitcoin because they can't take USD.  They aren't using it for any of its advantages or pseudo-anonymity.  They don't really have a choice.  They were forced into that but US politics and law enforcement, essentially.

Yes that's why they run a multi-million dollar company and you serve lunch in elementary school cafeteria.
And btw, I hate Coinbase but they are evil, not stupid.
@_date: 2016-05-30 13:12:14
Yes I know it wasn't their idea.  They are just playing ball and begging the people who run the government to Please PLEASE let us have this business so we can serve some customers and try to make a living.  We'll do whatever you demand, just please.

Yes that's another good example of how many in the Bitcoin community talk out of their a$$ and yelled "Thanks for the cheap coinz" at $800 and all the way down until they finally had to STFU.

I think vulnerability to 51% attacks and centralization of mining are higher on the flaw list than that.

The last thing the Power Elite want is "clarity" in this area.  It works against their interests.  It's better to have the laws vague so they can shakedown more Bitcoin companies like they did with Finex.

Because some of them of them are smart and they end up with more BTC in the end than holders have.  More money is the goal to some people, especially the smartest ones.
@_date: 2016-07-19 04:26:24


Where have you been?  The halving already caused a massive price increase.  Pull up a chart going back one year.
@_date: 2016-07-15 14:12:45
He should not talk about Ethereum or the other altcoins.  It will distract from the focus on Bitcoin.
Of course we all know that all these other crapcoins are worthless and post no threat to Bitcoin, but it's better if we do not give them free publicity on the podcast.  All of the propaganda should be pro-Bitcoin propaganda.  
I know there is that chart that shows the alts are dominating more and more of crypto market cap over time, but that can't be true because Bitcoin can be the only one.  And everyone who profits from ETH and XMR and STEEM and the others really didn't profit.  It must be imaginary money because you can only do good things with Bitcoin.
Ok a bit overdone with the /s but you get the point.
@_date: 2016-07-20 02:52:36
Dude is a victim of the Power Elite's War on Bitcoin.   I'm glad he made it out ok, but he should have never been in there to begin with.
@_date: 2016-07-31 12:32:26


That really worked well from $900 down to $170.
You know you don't have to "panic" to sell. Sometimes it's the rational and correct decision.  Get out and watch the price drop and then buy back even more BTC much lower.
@_date: 2016-07-19 13:19:57
Because that's human nature and also the price action in 2015 was not exactly encouraging for longs  And was smart of them to do so.

Bitcoin is not an asset class, of course.   Ethereum (and probably some other altcons) out performed Bitcoin in the first half of 2016.
But the bottom line is great opportunities for speculation and investment in crypto.
@_date: 2016-07-21 02:02:31
It's been more stable than the Pound for maybe the last 5 minutes but not on any larger time frame.

I don't remember Bill Hicks talking about the Power Elite, although perhaps he did in a roundabout way. I don't know anything about Alex Jones but I doubt he cares about Bitcoin that much.
@_date: 2016-07-28 21:16:39


That means nothing.  So out of that 50%, like 0.3% would perhaps consider Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-07-21 02:54:11
Actually, yes it does.  It is a minor project in their agenda, but definitely part of it.
@_date: 2016-07-10 19:11:39
Price is about 3x what it was last year.  That is not "stable".
@_date: 2016-07-02 11:33:05
Coinbase has sucked since 2013.
@_date: 2016-05-30 02:50:25
Same here..when Bitcoin went from $1100 to $170, that said a lot to me.   
And don't think it can't do it again.  Or think that way and take unnecessary risks with your money if you want.
@_date: 2016-07-17 18:17:09
It wouldn't hurt but bitcoin market is miniscule, so you probably will make little to nothing even if you are hot.  The exception is if you get a whale on your hook and then the sky is the limit.

The US does classify Bitcoin as a currency...and as a non-currency asset... and a couple more different things, depending on which agency is trying to f*ck you the hardest and deepest.

It's easier for people to criticize others than to actually take the time and energy to create something new themselves...even if they had the skill and talent, which they most likely do not.  But looks like a cool project and it will certainly get better through multiple iterations.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:53:05
Of course it's not over as long as even one person buys or sells BTC because of the halving.  You are stating the obvious.
@_date: 2016-07-19 04:40:14
Most people here want a lot of money without having to work for it and that is their only basis for the hope of "moon".

Markets are not 100% efficient because humans are not 100% efficient..not even close.  Fear and Greed are not rational and efficient and that is what many trading decisions are based on.

Yes seems like a foreign entity could influence the election by anonymously donating a bunch of BTC, although I suppose if it was a large enough amount, perhaps they would take additional verification steps and return it if those weren't successful.

I know I'm responding to a troll, but if he looked at the chart, he would see that the price did skyrocket.
@_date: 2016-07-19 14:26:53
Yes it was just a coincidence BTC went up 200% in the several months leading up to the halving.  That is very likely.
@_date: 2016-07-25 13:42:48
Yes the halvening hype caused the price rise.  And the halvening is what caused the halvening hype.
