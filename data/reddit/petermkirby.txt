You wouldn't have to rely on Bank of America's shaky record keeping as a way of proving your home belonged to you. In a Factom world, your title would be yours!
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:33:28
Very relevant: Factom is already in discussions with 2 countries about actually implementing title records on the blockchain. At the heart of the poverty problem is secure and legal property records.
@_date: 2014-12-22 19:10:32
More to come on that in 2015
@_date: 2014-11-17 21:55:03
We're still in early development phase for the technology - The best way to get involved is to become a community leader and help organize development groups. 
In early 2015 we'll explore some more opportunities to get financially involved.

Really good point. Bitcoin blockchain may not last forever, but there will be blockchains around for a very long time... Factom is blockchain agnostic (you can just as easily store a hash on Ethereum, NXT, etc.) - so there are lots of contingency plans if Bitcoin doesn't have 100+ years of life in it. 
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:16:00
This is a really important line of conversation for the Bitcoin space. A lot of the regulatory concern goes away when we start to talk about how Blockchain technology makes systems more honest and transparent. 
Security is a huge huge concern for big corporations and Blockchain solutions to security helps shift the perception of Bitcoin.

Storj is considering using Factom for some distributed record-keeping. 
Oh, and Shawn is a total badass! He knew about Factom before it was cool.
@_date: 2014-12-15 20:52:01
Ahhh... I'll fix that ~pk
EDIT: Ghetto fixed it!
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:24:51
Factom is a total bastardization of the latin word: Factum - statement of the facts; something done or made.
We followed Google's lead and misspelled it.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:22:13
The most important thing you can do as a normal consumer is start demanding accountability from your institutions.
Factom creates permanent records that can't be changed later. In a Factom world - there's no more Robo-signing scandals. In a Factom world, there are no more missing voting records. In a Factom world, you know where every dollar of government money was spent. 
Basically, the whole world is made up of record keeping and as a consumer, you're at the mercy of the fragmented systems that run these records. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:14:43
Definitely! We're always open to teams approaching us with a project. Right now, when we're in this pre-Beta phase, we're able to be really hands-on with developers because the feedback helps us make Factom better and more developer friendly.
Eventually, we want the tools to be simple and clear enough that you won't need us anymore. There are so many business problems that Factom  can solve!
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:30:47
I talked to Michael at length about a blockchain project we're working on. He's incredibly savvy and understands the tech side deeply. WSJ is lucky to have him.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:40:56
Let me answer the second part of this question, while Paul answers the technical part:
The way to onboard traditional companies (Like Bank of America or Bowing) is by engaging with the consulting companies that already have a relationship with them. IBM, Deloitte, and Mckinsey are all building groups to explore blockchain technology and build robust business solutions on top of the blockchain. 
BoA etc, will want to engage with one of these big software consulting firms because they have credibility and experience working with projects of this scope.
However, there will also be hundreds of new application companies that are launched using Factom and blockchain technology to solve problems in fast, cheap, and novel ways. You could be the next salesforce type company that totally disrupts the way big companies do business.
@_date: 2014-11-17 19:29:42
Definitely Complementary!
Sidechains is really cool technology that lets the blockchain do much more interesting things with currencies and value exchange.
Factom is more about record keeping and data.
When Sidechains gets implemented, we'll have to write some special code to accommodate them. Sidechains is a special case of the broad things that can be done with the blockchain.
@_date: 2014-12-22 15:22:41
Factom.org is an open-source blockchain technology project that's in development (APIs are available, project release in early 2015). 
@_date: 2014-12-22 19:06:05
I'd probably go directly to the whitepaper on GitHub - that's the best explanation. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:19:51
Here's photo proof:
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:21:20
Yes. Delotte, McKenzie, and IBM all have groups exploring blockchain technologies with the goal to provide these tools to big customers like Bank of America. We had a chance to meet with them at Money 20/20 and as we roll out the Factom technology, we'll look at these consulting companies as partners.

More on political transparency:
It starts with private and secure voting systems. Imagine a world where everyone can vote (only once) from whatever device they choose (feature phone, public library terminal, iPad). And imagine if they could vote in a truly private way without intimidation at the polls or the fear of repercussions after the election. Imagine if voting could be truly audited and refined every election cycle to make it more secure and user friendly.
Once you have secure voting, then you could start thinking about transparent and honest governing systems where every dollar could be tracked, audited and tied to the decision makers responsible. No more back-door agreements. No more hidden agendas. Factom could force these systems to be honest.
Also, a huge amount of mischief happens around the world when corrupt governments monkey with property title records (which remember, is where the majority of the world's wealth is held). Once you move all government records onto blockchains (using Factom) - corruption loses it's bite.
"Honesty is subversive" - Paul Snow
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:12:33
Yes. It's pretty well described in the paper. Factom.org/
The whitepaper was reviewed by Vitalik Buterin, Luke Dashjr, Ryan Singer, Ron Gross, J.R. Willett, etc. - lots of the key people in the space.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:57:21
Making exchanges honest is one of the first projects that's being done on Factom. You can run a proof-of-audit on steroids - letting you produce a true audit trail of every transaction at every moment. That'll really get businesses to sit up and notice. 
The other application that will pop up right away is Title Records - because they secure such a large portion of a country's wealth. We've already had a country reach out to us about building a Title Application using Factom/Bitcoin Blockchain.
We've also been approached by a group that wants to trade commodities with Factom. 
Big companies like Bank of America and BP have been fined $10's of billions for losing track of their systems of record. So you'll see a lot of fast movement in the opportunity to move mortgage and energy systems onto Factom.
Lots of interesting things being built on Factom - my guess is the first ones will be the simple options that solve a lot of pain.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:37:46
Yes. Legal precedent is a powerful tool. Especially if it's recognized by the World Bank or another major NGOs. This would allow people's rights to be documented and protected outside the country, not just within the country. 
The first goal is to have more secure property records and tools to help developing nations leap forward in their record-keeping. There is a secondary goal to build an accepted way to manage land rights using blockchain technology, but that's a much more complicated question.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:58:30
Yup. 
Factom publishes a transparent public ledger for external consumption. We'll continue to build more elegant tools for exploration.
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:42:54
There will also be a public, searchable database of the records at the title application level. Factom just provides an external immutable record to verify that the land titles haven't been changed.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:02:00
Hi. Peter from Factom here. We'll do an AMA today 5/19 at 3:00pm CST to answer questions about this and other Land Title projects and talk more about some of the technical details involved. 
EDIT: Here's the AMA link: 
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:51:44
1. Factom stores 1 KB of data per entry (usually a hash, a digital signature, and some metadata) - so we can easily do hundreds of gigabytes of land records as hashes (see the gutenberg library example). We hashed all of the books in the public record into Factom in minutes.
2. Factom provides blockchain as a service. Build a database, give it a Factom back end with a few API calls. The API will be well documented and expertise will be market-value. 
3. The consensus paper explains the model with example attack vectors and security measures.  
4. Yes, all systems have a garbage-in = garbage-out problem. The application is designed with many checks against getting bad data in. All normal corrections of data are available, but it's a chain so you can track these changes: Misspelled name record + Correctly spelled name record. You just can't deny the changes.
5. Yes, of course there are a other immutable database strategies. Pick the one that's right for your application and situation. Blockchains aren't a panacea.
@_date: 2015-05-16 13:54:16
 - there's a consensus paper along with the white paper. On Reddit: Paul Snow u/paulsnow has also discussed at length the Factom system, how it works, security, and its relationship to the Bitcoin Blockchain. He's been building enterprise software for 30 years. The code is on GitHub. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:31:10
(Sorry. Missed this one)
Storage in the 2015 is cheap. In this situation the database that stores the documents has multiple cloud back-ups and a cold storage version that's locked down at a remote site. There are also paper copies of everything stored in a vault and each person keeps a paper copy of recorded instruments in their home or security deposit box. So there are a lot of original copies in the case of a disaster to recreate the record. This is a very common practice with important records. 
Compare that to the earthquake in Haiti where many people lost the only copy of their birth records  - we want to use 21st century technology to move way beyond that.
However, yes. If a country loses all of the documentation behind it's title record system it could be disastrous and it would have to be recreated in a painstaking manner. Factom will have some meta-data including property ids that would help recreate the system of record.
@_date: 2014-11-13 18:41:48
Factom will be releasing the Whitepaper along with an Alpha-version API kit on Monday 11/17.
All of the Factom core developers will be on a Reddit AMA starting 1:00pm CST on Monday to answer questions!
EDIT: We moved the AMA to 1:00pm CST
@_date: 2015-05-15 22:51:01
Hey. Peter here. Yes. We'll definitely do a AMA. We're still ironing out all of the legal details - which is why we've been a bit quiet on the technical front. Obviously, we've been working hard on this for a while. We'll plan on an AMA early next week.
@_date: 2015-05-19 21:04:12
1) Factom runs its own consensus algorithm based on a follow-the-leader model called Raft. You can read about it here: - essentially, Factom secures itself and it gets backed up by Bitcoin every 10 minutes.
2) Yes, we individually hold bitcoins. Our incentives are aligned!
@_date: 2014-12-29 18:21:29
I always think of Bitcoin long term value as a function of it's utility. The more useful Bitcoin is, the more value it creates. 
These Bitcoin 2.0 innovations help make Bitcoin much more valuable because the Blockchain Technology creates many more uses for Bitcoin beyond currency and payments. If the Blockchain also secures millions of records, transfers value of many different asset classes, and enables secure decentralized communications - than it makes Bitcoin's value much more concrete. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 16:03:01
thanks. I'm a nincompoop at spelling
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:38:28
Reach out to us on our site: Factom.org - we're always curious about how we can help developers make better and more effective projects.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:38:48
Not immediately. Factom is built for data scalability and can handle many orders of magnitude more data than Bitcoin. 
Eventually, Factom will also have a data volume problem as vast amounts of data are secured by the system. From there we can build multiple Factom server clusters and tie together the payment chains... but we'll cross that bridge when we come to it.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:57:19
Nope. Factom data is distributed. All of the Merkle tree proofs are stored in a distributed hash table spread across nodes around the globe. If the data's important to you (or your country) you would just run a partial node of that data. This lets Factom data live far beyond the life cycle of the Factom network. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 20:01:55
When you post on Facebook, cloud services, etc. you don't really own your data and you're subject to their crazy centralized security problems. 
In a Factom world, your data could really be locked down and private with private keys and you in total control. I hate to say it, but in a Factom World - no more naked pics of ScarJo. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:26:14
1. We have a working prototype of the title application and will begin a pilot program shortly. We expect to have the pilot program in place and demonstrating value by the end of the year.
2. We've had interest from Insurance Companies, Financial Institutions, Medical Records, Pharmaceuticals, etc. Immutable ledgers are a very useful tool. Land registries are a very visible use for immutable ledgers with a lot of urgency and pain associated.
3. Yes. I totally believe that comfort with blockchain technology solutions leads to more comfort with digital currencies in general. Just like comfort with online shopping made people more comfortable with online banking. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:17:48
Really good question. There will always be land disputes that need to be settled in court. The system is designed to catch land disputes before they get entered into the permanent record. However, if there are corrections that are required by a court of law, the changes can be made... there's just a record of these changes.
A simple example: If a deed has a name misspelling - there is a correction, but both the misspelled record and the corrected record have peg in the blockchain. That way you can see how and when the correction was made.
In the case where there's a ruling that contradicts what's in Factom (a deed was mis-recorded). The documentation is logged along with the revised record and there's a proof of the whole process. 
Factom's not designed to be a perfect land record. Factom is designed to publish and document the process for land records.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:28:53
Yes. There are lots of proposed solutions for writing to the blockchain. Where Factom is valuable is the proof-of-process. You can create chains and chains of chains... this means that each title can be it's own true "chain of title" and the process to create that title record can be logged in a chain. It's a more powerful data structure than Bitcoin alone. 
Factom also solves the problem of Bloat. Bitcoin is simply not built to handle the transaction volume associated with securing a single country's land records, let alone the entire world.
@_date: 2015-05-20 13:39:55
Yes. Don't lose the deed to your house.
In most land title situations there's a database of all of the records backed up by paper copy of the instruments backed up by personal copies of the records. In this situation we take it further with multiple cloud back-ups and cold storage back-ups. Storage in 2015 is cheap.
You can also add some meta-data to Factom (Property ID number, etc.) along with the hash, so there's a way to partially recreate the property record if it's lost.
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:55:39
oh. yes. exactly. Factom doesn't store the original copy. That's up to the user or the application.
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:02:27
Hi. Peter from Factom here. We'll do an AMA today 5/19 at 3:00pm CST to answer questions and talk more about some of the technical details involved. 
@_date: 2015-05-20 14:36:10
Factoids will be available on exchanges in the next few months.
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:43:37
Yes. A lot of this problem is solved with a less-shitty centralized DB. The mining and blockchain provides an external audit trail so the centralized DB avoids the corruption problems that have plagued these systems in the past. To paraphrase Lord Acton:
"Absolute centralization corrupts absolutely."
@_date: 2015-05-20 00:49:11
A lot of people assume that Factom is just another existence proof tool on the blockchain: Take a thing and create an immutable copy of the thing. 
Factom actually does a lot more than that... Factom lets you create chains of immutable data that form a proof-of-process - showing how records and processes change over time. It's the difference between a time-stamped photo and a immutable documentary film. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:50:18
Oooh. We all hope so!
Factom is one of the first applications to piggyback on the security and immutability of the Bitcoin Blockchain - and tell the story of Blockchain Technology as layered stacks (like HTTP is layered on top of TCP/IP). 
We've always believed that the long term value of Bitcoin is tied to it's long term utility and Factom can start demonstrating how this long term utility will look.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:02:53
Yes. We're working directly with the Property Institute of Honduras. This is the government body that is in charge of recording Land Titles.
@_date: 2015-05-19 20:05:25
Yes. Many countries have reached out to Factom about similar projects. Land Title corruption is a very common problem in the developing world and a immutable ledger solution could help these economies move forward dramatically.
@_date: 2015-05-18 12:13:27
Honduras gets a robust and powerful title application built by people with 20+ years experience in title software. In addition, it secures the title record with a write only public ledger of hashes. Trust me, they know exactly what they're getting. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:03:00
Hi. Peter from Factom here. We'll do an AMA today 5/19 at 3:00pm CST to answer questions and talk more about some of the technical details involved. 
@_date: 2015-05-19 15:07:25
(yup. planning it for today)
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:53:59
hahah. Peter here from Factom. Although I know shockingly little about almost everything... Factom is one of the things that I do know an awful lot about. 
And yes, a bit too much travel and conference conversation for me...
Let me clear up a few things:
1) Entry credits are non-transferable and have no exchange value. You're buying access to publish into Factom. 
2) There's a floating exchange rate to turn Factoids into entry credits. So at $0.15 per Factoid it buys you 150 entry credits (or 150 entries into Factom).
3) The servers (voted on by users) are in charge of the exchange rate.
4) If the price of Factoids ~~raises~~ rises to $1.50 it will now buy you 10x as many entry credits (1500). 
Very simple.
Chris's question was about fixing one floating price commodity against another - which is obviously insane. I was a bit too fuzzy to understand why he asked that question. What I didn't realize he missed was an entry credit is non-transferrable. 
Sorry for the confusion everyone. 
EDIT: Typo
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:57:43
Yup. I'm normally pretty good about explaining the economics of Factom (I did help design them). I just got tripped up by Chris's misconceptions about how things worked. Sorry for the scare everyone. 
@_date: 2015-08-04 02:57:24
wow. yes. I clearly wasn't firing on all cylinders.  
@_date: 2015-08-03 19:55:34
Ouch. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:07:43
hahah. Yes. I appreciate the snarky-ness, we're all excited for a more transparent world and want it tomorrow. These projects take a long time and involve many many interested parties. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:09:28
if you can't transfer a thing... you can't arb a thing. simple.
@_date: 2015-08-15 15:05:38
Hi all. Peter Kirby from Factom. We have a commitment from the head of the property institute/Chief of Staff of Honduras. Yes, politics in Central America are messy and slow and that's been delaying the roll-out and further discussion of this project. 
Re: Other countries... stay tuned. These kinds of projects often take a long time to gestate. 
@_date: 2015-08-03 20:34:13
haha. thanks!
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:36:58
Oh. This turns out to be really simple. The USD account just requires multiple physical signatures with a phone verification to confirm authenticity. Financial institutions have been able to do this for a long time. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:36:41
Hash is stored in Factom and a merkle tree anchor of Factom is placed in the blockchain every 10 minutes. So Factom piggybacks on the immutability of the blockchain.
Yes. Factom gives you 1K data (around 1 page of text) per entry. Most people will want to use that to store a hash and some metadata (and keep their private kittens private). Once stored in Factom, it's a distributed hash table (like Bittorrent) of the data. Anyone can keep a copy. Federated servers will keep a copy of all of the data. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 20:35:54
A Big Mac needs to be as expensive as it can to make money and as cheap as it can to encourage people to buy lots of them ... Entry Credits will work the same way. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 11:58:26
Hi. Peter from Factom here. I'm the guy who makes these decisions. We tried to be very up front and transparent about this with our customers. We all love Bitcoin and hold lots personally. Our fiduciary responsibility to the Factom Foundation is manage the money with the least amount of risk. We chose not to keep funds in Bitcoin (which lost 15% in the last week). Please see this as us being good stewards of the foundation funds. 
In addition, the Foundation doesn't take a dime until we deliver a beta product - the funds remained locked in a multi signature account (the USD account requires multi physical signatures).
Thanks for watching out for the project. We appreciate the support and enthusiasm. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:25:40
Sigh. Yes. But the market actually jumped up after we sold. I'll never be smart enough to figure out the market dynamics of Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-16 12:17:22
Lots of options once we have the funds released to us. (We have a partnership with Tether to explore exactly that option). In the short term this is just about simplicity and risk mitigation. 
@_date: 2015-04-18 12:22:07
100% True. We set up the Factom Foundation in London because it was the friendliest jurisdiction. We were able to have meaningful conversations at high levels and everyone we talked with was informed and open minded. Both California and New York can learn a lot from their approach. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 16:24:02
Really awesome point. That's one of the key concerns that Koinify.com has tried to address with their Milestone platform. Factom will not receive a dime from the sale until the Beta Software is shipped and tokens are tradable. That helps protect purchasers. 
@_date: 2015-04-01 14:32:26
Factom is a ledger system, so the Factoid token is actually issued on Factom. The system goes live after the sale and the tokens become tradable. 
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:23:09
Just in time for the Factoid Software Sale tomorrow!
@_date: 2015-03-25 14:25:45
Ladies and Gentlemen... Mr. Paul Snow
@_date: 2015-03-31 15:18:12
Hi. Peter from Factom here. Don't want to give any buying advice (obviously, you'll do your own research). 
The Factoid Software Sale sets the total number of Factoids that will exist. It also provides an endowment for the Non-Profit to continue developing the open-source software. If you're excited about Factom and all of it's potential - it's a good way to participate. You'll own some Factoids and you'll be supporting the system.
It's also really useful to know that Factoids become more scarce the more the system gets used. As companies, governments, and institutions build projects on top of Factom, they'll use a lot of entries into the system. Factoids are used to buy these entry credits and get removed from the system. So there's a real link between Factoids and the utility of the protocol. 
Hope this helps! We're always around to answer more questions.

George is also a fascinating futurist in addition to an economist. He wrote Microcosm in 1990 about how silicon will change our lives and then in 2000 he wrote Telecosm about how bandwidth will change our lives... These were hugely influential books. He's been studying the intersection of Technology, Money, and Society for longer than most of the community has been alive.
