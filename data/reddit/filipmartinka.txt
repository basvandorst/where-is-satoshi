I can't wait until all of this private / fast blockchain nonsense fizzles out. I'm tired of seeing comments like yours, because they never make sense and it just ends up in an argument. 
If you could conceivable scale systems faster than that, Bitcoin would have done it. The smartest blockchain devs and engineers worldwide are in BTC, and they ignore that other crap becuase _it doesn't really work_. 
Having some new 'blockchain' has no benefit over the existing systems and if anything will create a slowdown for HFTs, and waste unnecessary server power. Banks already have SWIFT, they don't need 30 new proprietary 'magic beans' which cannot even interconnect.
It's all a sham.

It's also important to mention that Counterparty has significant BETTING functionality. You can place bets and CfDs. Decentralized sportsbooks that use XCP:
* Never have access to your finances (your XCP are either in your wallet or escrowed on the Blockchain itself)
* Charge the lowest fees in the industry (even Bitcoin industry):
**~0.5 to 1%**
* Can't run off with your money ! (or spend it on a Tokyo penthouse for example...)
Some examples:

There are actually fully decentralized services for this purpose, where your money is escrowed on the Blockchain directly (0.5% to 1% fee only):
This means that your funds become inaccessible until the bet is resolved or expired. Then based on the outcome, they are automatically transmitted or returned.

Gambling scams and rigged games can be avoided by using [Counterparty]( and [Counterwallet]( It supports decentralized feed betting (you can create your own predictions as well), and trustless betting as well (rock paper scissors, and rock paper scissors through the blockchain.
This allows you to place bets and gamble with verifiable fairness and full transparency. The broadcasters of feeds (oracles), who create new predictions and bets, never have access to your funds.

This supports everything "colored coins" do, and has a decentralized asset exchange for user created "coins" or "shares" with dividend payment functionality in BTC, XCP, and other user-created assets.
All orders on the fully peer-to-peer exchange are algorithmically matched.
And this application will soon be adding cross-blockchain vending machines to Counterparty functionality (as close to decentralized altcoin trading as we can get).

Counterparty is not a coin. It's part of the Bitcoin network. XCP is only an asset to enable escrow functionality along with betting and all that. It's not mineable, and its deflationary.

I think the main choice for preferring Counterparty if you are an established company is liquidity, fair distribution, and security. When considering a significant move like this, risk analysis should take top priority.
* Counterparty treats Bitcoin as a first-class citizen within its system, equal in importance to its own meta-currency XCP. Dividends can be paid in Bitcoin, and BTC can be used wherever technically feasible. 
* XCP was not 'sold' or 'funded'. There was no pre-mine or pre-sale or anything of that sort. Users were able to send BTC to a provably inaccessible BTC address (with no known private key) in return for XCP. Therefore everyone, including founders and devs, had the same opportunity as everyone else.  To illustrate why this is important, see:  [proof-of-burn](
* Counterparty uses the Bitcoin blockchain for security and has had two formal, comprehensive security audits by [Peter Todd]( and [Sergio Lerner]( 
"[The] Counterparty client is the smallest, readable and yet completely usable “alt-coin” I’ve ever seen.' - Sergio Lerner

Absolutely nobody bothers to fully research what is and what isn't good, they go by marketing. 
Source: I have to do in-depth altcoin research on an almost daily basis as part of my work. There are such obvious irregularities and terrifying issues that nobody notices. Also features that are assumed to be "implemented long ago" do not even have an alpha implementation.
Counterparty has consistently impressed me at how complete it is. They never begged anyone for money, didn't try to sell anything, and never bragged about features that were not working yet. 5/5

@_date: 2014-09-04 07:22:32
That was not the intention at all. I can rephrase it. The thing is that XCP is escrow enabled and supports other interesting functionality, which cannot be accomplished with BTC directly. This is why it has value. To create Counterparty assets, you need XCP. So if there is demand for counterparty, there is value for XCP.

It's weird. As a copywriter I usually get hired either AFTER something terrible happens (or way, way before starting a project). Trying to save money on communicating with your clients and customers often causes exponentially larger damages than hiring an experienced communicator (social media expert, copywriter, marketer, public speaker, etc) would. And then fixing a damaged reputation can be costly, or impossible.
And surprisingly enough, often the text can be completely correct and understandable, but the cultural differences are insurmountable (like misunderstanding clear sarcasm). Maybe this whole thing makes a lot more sense in Chinese? I have no idea.

Actually, Plutus doesn't use the credit cards of buyers (traders). 
Instead, Plutus generates a new virtual credit card for each individual user, which is then funded by the buyer's (trader's) escrowed funds. The virtual credit card only comes into play when paying with NFC at the point of sale of your choice. 
You -&gt; Trader -&gt; Virtual Card (Escrow) -&gt; Merchant PoS
@_date: 2015-11-11 11:26:10
True, but there is solid reasoning behind this.
* The exchange rate is not something that we will decide. It will be fully determined by the market, and therefore will be competitive. 
* Plutus is simply bridging technologies to allow for practical use of Bitcoin today. Many people want to use it today, and pressuring merchants to accept it does not seem to be working as expected yet. While it is great to be enthusiastic and utopian, direct mainstream adoption will take significant time. Unfortunately, it's difficult to pay for groceries or a subway ticket using 'philosophy'. 
* Our target audience are people who wish to use it, rather than engage in theory about how it could work. Plutus will undoubtedly help create a gateway to adoption, since merchants may realize what is going on and seek to reduce their fees. At the moment however, we are purely utilitarian and offer usability rather than future promises.
*  While traditional payment methods are not, the peer-to-peer exchange aspect of Plutus is in fact within the 'philosophy of Bitcoin' by removing the need for a middleman to hold your bitcoins. This is the optimal solution until mainstream adoption becomes a thing. it is definitely far closer to full decentralization than other solutions available, and we aim to further decentralize it wherever and whenever possible.
* Eliminating the existing system will definitely not happen over night, and even when merchants accept Bitcoin, they usually sell them immediately or use a service to do so. In fact, traditional payment processors might co-exist with bitcoin indefinitely. This is not a predictable or knowable factor. In the end, Plutus is essentially the same concept, but with more efficiency and decentralization.
* Our team actually decided to build this solution because we all intend to use it as well, because it solves real challenges in the real world. Our motivation is that we are certain there are people out there who will agree with this sentiment, and wish to spend their bitcoins today.
@_date: 2015-11-10 16:26:20
You send bitcoin directly to a trader who is buying BTC on the decentralized exchange. The trader then sends fiat to the virtual credit card back-end which then makes a payment to your merchant. Does that make sense?

Actually, the intent is to be practical, it was never meant to be 'disruptive' (especially since it plugs into existing infrastructure). It wouldn't make sense to be 'disruptive'. It's a stepping stone towards adoption and a practical use-case that many have been asking for. Also, we don't hold anyone's bitcoin, they are sent to traders directly.
The true innovation is the decentralized exchange which eliminates the need to connect to a third-party exchange and adopt their additional fees, or trust a centralized entity with holding your funds indefinitely.

It's stored in the Bitcoin blockchain (not patched nodes or anything like that), readable by any client provided that it can parse them. You basically only need counterparty-lib to read and parse them.
All broadcasts are searchable on block explorers such as [blockscan]( You can definitely write bigger messages like 200 or even 2000 chars using counterparty-lib and counterparty-cli. It usually saves in OP_RETURN or multi-sig outputs.  For example, [this broadcast is huge](

Dozens of millions of NFC-enabled devices are being shipped every year, and the number is growing. Additionally, new POS terminals will likely have to comply with standards that support NFC.

Now that it's fully modular and performance optimized, I think more devs will notice.

First, you (the customer) receive an address generated by a smart contract.
Upon receiving the coins, the smart contract releases these coins to the buyers' address(es) which are programmed into the contract.
It is designed so that if a user sends 1 BTC (you can send any amount) and the buyer with the top price has funds to only support 0.8 btc, then 0.2 will be sent to the next buyer in the queue. So essentially multiple traders are part of the same contract, inside the decentralized trading engine.
They cannot debit Bitcoin from your account at will. Once you charge your account, you will have a balance

Same here, but I think that's only a small part of what it will be useful for.

I think we can all agree that would be less cool and radical

Not quite. Plutus uses a decentralized exchange to directly connect users with traders, and directly connect traders with the virtual credit card system. This removes a lot more centralization and is closer to how we believe Bitcoin should be used, without relying on centralized parties as much as possible.

I weep for all the devs worldwide who will have to make all of this crap interoperable.

You need .5 xcp to create a _named_ asset. You can create numeric ones with just BTC.

They may notice that there is an entire profit industry built on their reluctance to accept it, and that they are greatly reducing their margins. Merchants usually only respond to market pressure and cold hard stats. The main point is that users shouldn't have to wait for merchants to wake up and engage them.

XCP can't function without BTC, it doesn't compete with it. It's a clever way to add new features that can interact with BTC while still using the same blockchain.
