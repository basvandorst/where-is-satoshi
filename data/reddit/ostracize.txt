No, the fact that it lives in the blockchain does not mean there is a relationship to the price of bitcoin. The shares can only be bought in USD at an agreed upon rate. After an agreement and payment is made, the owner uses Bitcoin to transfer the ownership.

It isn't clear from the article whether or not the merchant would actually have access to the underlying public keys/addresses. A central authenticator could just do translations without revealing that data (same as Google and Facebook do it today).
But if that data were provided, there would be all kinds of uses - this being one of them. There's also an opportunity for merchants to use the address as reputation to help decide trustworthiness for transactions.
@_date: 2014-06-09 14:43:21
Just had this thought the other day...
Is there such thing as a chequing account that automatically converts fiat to bitcoin (whatever the market price is)?
eg. I submit my chequing account information to my employer and as far as they can tell, it's a legit chequing account, but in fact all the money going in automatically triggers a bitcoin buy?

@_date: 2014-05-05 20:41:34
By "translations", what I meant was a translation from the public address to a merchant's internal customer id. Not from key to address or vice versa.
In other words, central BitID service A could authenticate me and say to merchant X that I am definitely customer AX_123 without ever revealing my address to X.

You should update your documentation:
@_date: 2014-08-20 04:30:03
Go to blockchain.info and search for the address you sent the bitcoins to. You can verify that the transaction occurred.
Your copy will get up to date eventually. Once it does, you can then spend the bitcoins again. But until then, blockchain is already up to date and is useful for just checking up on things.
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:22:21
Is it not true that both "importing" and "sweeping" a private key should render that corresponding public address "compromised" and should not be re-used?
This is why "sweeping" is a better idea. It actually takes the funds out of that "now compromised" address and puts the funds at a new (secret) address whereas "importing" will leave the funds at the same address.

I just realized that QR Code readers/generators can be an effective method of communication without the need for wireless/Bluetooth. I'm surprised this hasn't caught on yet as a potential fallback in the event of widespread jamming. 
@_date: 2014-08-21 01:06:27
Your wallet will be incapable of sending bitcoins until it recognizes you actually have something to spend.
This is why a wallet like ethereum or a web wallet like coinbase or blockchain is useful. It depends on a remote copy of the blockchain for up to date information. You shouldn't use a client that needs a local copy until you are more experienced.

I don't think there'd be any incentive to do this to the protocol, but there's nothing stopping you from writing on top of the protocol a front end that consults a database to do the translations for you.

Well, depending on your relationship with the company, you can offer to accept part of your wages/salary in bitcoin.

Two questions
1. How do transaction fees work? Which miners get the transaction fee I pay? How do pools come in to play? Can transaction fees be traced back to specific miners wallets? If so, how? Is there any incentive for a miner to not confirm a transaction?
2. Is there any incentive or reason for the bitcoin community to "blacklist" certain bitcoins - or any transactions that originated from a specific wallet? Eg. could bitcoiners "blacklist" any of DPR's bitcoins?
