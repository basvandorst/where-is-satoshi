You're agreement with me is in the minority.  Most responses to me have been rather hostile. Probably because the logic is hard to refute.  That said, I would rather salvage what's left than pray for another period of lunacy.  I invite anyone to comment on my site and provide either a logical, non emotional thought out answer.  I don't claim clairvoyance, but I have been right on this sector all along.  I have been wrong on Gold all along.….thanks so much for your comments.  Marko

Stay tuned.   by oblivion i dont mean literally zero in price, I mean that they will not only be of nominal value but they will never have a practical use as currently designed.

HAD ME going for a second.    How much have you lost this year?   If you can lose the rest, no big deal.  If it matters to you to preserve you diminished asset value, take a hard look.  My Space was a fad....

I think I've been pretty correct, however, feel free to disagree.  As long as you back up your reasoning and you stay civil, I will print your argument.  I may disagree but You have never seen me claim that I am omniscient.  That said, I am still negative on these. I have stated the reasons, but I will be the first to admit I'm wrong if you can formulate a compelling argument.   Don't assume that your voice won't be heard.

yes, I realize that I am making a case for something.  I further realize that If I'm right more than wrong, I'm ahead of the game.  As far as cryptos has gone, I've been right.  But, feel free to disagree on my website or here and if you can present a cogent argument, I will print it on my site and if give you credit if you are able to either find errors in my logic or provide valuable insight to readers.....fair???

Bitcoin is hanging pretty tough.  I don't see why yet, but it is interesting that BTC continues to hang tough.  I haven't a clue as to why, but the fundamentals of these things are neither important to price nor closely followed.
As to the rest, you may be right.  I will disagree slightly in that I could see 3 surviving but at no value.  These are "bus tokens".  They have some use but no real value.....1000 failures in 2018  is not  a good sign
