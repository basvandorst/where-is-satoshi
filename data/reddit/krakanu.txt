Plenty of people are using bitcoin just fine.  I'm sure far more people are mugged or have their credit card's info stolen than have had their bitcoin wallet info stolen.  Should we stop using fiat and credit cards too because they're not secure?


Ludicrous.  You are blaming the hammer and not the craftsman who wields it.  Bitcoin functions perfectly fine as a store of value and with upcoming improvements, will hopefully function more like a currency as it did before the blocks filled up.  It is a tool that does its job well.  If you misuse it that's on you.

All of crypto is volatile right now.  You make it sound like BTC is the only one.


I'd like to borrow the crystal ball you're using that told you this.  It's volatile right now because its future is uncertain and because the market is small enough that large individuals or coordinated groups can manipulate it.  The more widespread BTC (or any crypto) becomes, the more difficult it will be to manipulate.  


I didn't see a single person concerned about this during the October-December crypto media frenzy.  I'm sure there are lots of early adopters that made money off that.  Most people aren't worried about their bank usage making banks rich, why would they give a shit about crypto making early adopters rich?  People will want to use crypto because it will (hopefully) be useful to them and improve their life and they won't care about stupid side effects like this.


I will agree this is a major concern with crypto as a whole.  This is also why people need to be very wary of up and coming alt-coins and why it is so important for people to understand the technology behind the coins.

All currencies require a human to use it.  I don't see how this adds anything to the argument of bitcoin vs (any other currency).  
You may have heard the saying "A fool and his money are soon parted."  It doesn't specify what form that money takes.  If people don't make wise decisions with whatever they chose to store value in, they are going to lose it, whether that be spending it on silly things or refusing to understand how to properly secure it.  There's a reason people constantly repeat that you should store your bitcoin on a hardware wallet and not on an exchange or your PC.

I don't deny this is true, but anybody that thinks it will stay this way forever is being 100% ridiculous in my opinion.  People keep harping on this point as if its never going to change.  We live in the information age where things can change in the blink of an eye.  How long did it take before smartphones went from first release to now being widely owned by a large portion of the population including even children?  How much of a stretch is it to imagine all these people with smartphones now using it to trade crypto with each other?
In my opinion, the question isn't "Should I invest in crypto?", the question is simply "Which coin do you think will win out?".


I don't understand why you think this.  If anything, a coin is more likely to see widespread adoption because it has a long history that proves it is reliable and safe versus a fresh new coin that is unknown and has no history of usage.  Why do you believe that the opposite is true?  I'm not hating, I'm just trying to understand where this viewpoint comes from.


I don't see how this is relevant to BTC gaining widespread adoption.  If anything, it shows that larger % swings in price are more difficult as the price rises, which lends towards more price stability.  You're just explaining how percentages work in general, which can apply to the price of literally anything.  
My hope is that, in the near future, people won't buy BTC to see big gains, they'll buy it because its more convenient than putting their money in a bank.  They can access it 24/7, instantly, and send it to anybody, anywhere and not have to answer any questions from anybody about who they sent it to or why.

If you just dumped all your crypto on a single exchange as one giant lump you'd crash the price on that exchange and then arbitrage bots would come in and make money off your stupidity.  Imagine if somebody wanted to sell 200k bitcoins on GDAX all at once when normally only like 20-50k are traded a day.  You'd fill all the sell orders and the bulk of your coins would sell for next to nothing.
If you have a shitload of crypto and suddenly want to sell all of it for some reason, whats the best way to do it to maximize your fiat gains?  Assuming its all the same type of crypto, you'd get a better price if you converted pieces of it into various other cryptos and sold it slowly over time across various exchanges.  This way you can slowly lower the price across various exchanges and get a decent amount of fiat for your crypto.  
If you crash the price on a single exchange, you might sell 25% of it at the top and then the other 75% for next to nothing because you hit the market with an amount far larger than what is traded on a day to day basis.  Then people come in and buy from you for almost nothing and sell it on another exchange where the price hasn't dropped yet.

Most people that are hodling are doing it for a long term goal such as [this]( rather than any % gain.  The point is that some people really see this as a technological movement rather than just a market to make money off of.
@_date: 2018-01-03 22:20:36


Its not calculated.  It is an average of the prices people pay across various exchanges.
I looked at your post history and saw that you played WoW, so think of it like this:  Each bitcoin exchange is like an auction house on a different WoW server, except in addition to posting items(bitcoins) they want to sell, they can also post buy orders too(I'll pay $x for y bitcoins).  People buy and sell bitcoin on each exchange for whatever price they choose to post it to the exchange for.   I can post a buy order right now for 10,000 bitcoins for $1 but that doesn't mean anybody will take me up on my offer.
Some exchanges have a different mid market price (the value exactly between the buy and sell orders) because they simply have a different user base, just like WoW servers do, and they agreed upon a different price for that specific item.  People can make money by performing arbitrage between these exchanges (buy low on x exchange and sell high on y exchange) just like they can make gold by buying items on server x and transferring to server y and selling the item.  This can be more difficult if the exchanges are using two different currencies though, which is why there are larger gaps in those instances.


Another thing to note, if you live in the US, the IRS wants you to pay capital gains taxes every time you sell any crypto (even if you do a trade from one crypto to another).  If you're trading small amounts this will probably significantly eat into your gains (in addition to any fees you may be paying to the exchange). 
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:31:53
That sounds like more of a problem with technology built on top of bitcoin rather than bitcoin itself.  The ATM should have told him that the fees are high right now and he'll either lose most of his $5 to fees or that it would take a long time.  I believe a good wallet program would tell you this, but the ATM guys probably don't care and would rather just eat his money.  Thus it falls on to the user to be knowledgeable about what they are dealing with, and in this case, it looks like a fool and their money were parted...
Despite what anyone says, cryptocurrency is still in its infancy and people shouldn't be messing with it without doing research first.  FOMO is driving people to use something they do not understand because they think it will make them money.

This sentence is oddly worded, but I believe you're trying to say its harder to stop computer theft via malware than to stop someone breaking into your house and cracking your safe, yes?  Even if that's true, I'd say its irrelevant.  
The thing is you can store your bitcoin in places other than your computer.  In fact, you can store it entirely within your head, or in a hardware/paper wallet in a safe sitting right on top of your gold bars if you wish.  If your country goes to shit and you need to escape with all your money, which do you think it'd be easier to cross the border with, a car full of gold bars, stacks of fiat cash, or a bitcoin wallet address that you've memorized? (assuming your money isn't in the countries' bank in which case its already toast)  I understand this is an unlikely scenario, but when arguing the security of various currencies one should assume the worst.


I concede that currently this is one of the downsides of crypto.  However, I would expect that in a world where bitcoin (or some crypto) is widely adopted this would change though.  If the government is taxing me on crypto's value then they agree that it has value, and should help in the event that something of value is lost due to criminal activity.
@_date: 2018-01-22 20:12:35
Every coin is going to have early adopters that are going to gain more than later adopters whether it was created 10 years ago or 500 years from now.  That is the very nature of risk vs reward.  Any new coin is risky.  If 20 years from now some new coin is created that the world decides is perfect and everybody moves to it, how is it not going to have this same "problem" that current coins have?
I agree that there will be a lot of barriers and challenges for any coin to overcome in order to see widespread adoption, but I don't accept that all current coins have an 'extra' barrier simply by existing currently.  If a government mandates that any crypto used in its borders must have 'x' feature in order to be legal, there is nothing stopping BTC or any other current coin from changing into something that is legal there, rather than an entirely new coin needing to be developed. 
@_date: 2018-01-02 21:12:44
Forked coins only have value if people agree that they do.  Generally this means that it must provide something that the original did not.  Currently bitcoin cash is providing a service that bitcoin cannot, and thus it has value for people that need this service.  Hopefully, with the eventual adoption of segwit, the lightning network, and other improvements to bitcoin, this service will no longer be necessary.  Where will the value be then?
People complain about bitcoin only being a store of value because most retailers won't accept it, but I don't see many retailers currently accepting any of these alt-coins either so currently all cryptocurrencies fall victim to this argument (I'd be happy to be proven wrong).  If everybody today dropped their bitcoin and all switched to the same alt-coin, it would be having the same problems bitcoin is having right now.  Network overloaded and high fees, or worse.

You DO need to understand not to stick your finger in the electrical socket to not get shocked.  You DO need to understand phishing and malware on a general level (basic internet safety) to use the internet.  And you do need to understand how to secure and use your crypto (private keys, transaction fees) if you want to live in a world where one is widely used (which I and many others believe is coming).

Hes saying, of that 21m, several hundred thousand have been lost (if not more).  So the total amount that will ever actually be used = 21m - (amount of bitcoin lost), which will only go up over time as more are lost.  No realistic amount of computing power can recover these lost bitcoins, and if someone does find a way to recover them, then bitcoin as a whole is now worthless because they could take coins from anybody.

On the left is the order book.  On top in reddish-orange is **SUPPLY**. These are people trying to sell bitcoin.  It shows the price they want to sell at and the amount they want to sell. On the bottom of the order book in green is **DEMAND**.  These are people that want to buy bitcoin.  It shows the price they want to buy at and the amount they want to buy.
Dead center of the screen is another representation of the order book (where it says "Mid Market Price").  This is where supply meets demand.  That is what determines the "price" of bitcoin.  If you look at the orange part of the graph, you will probably see some stair steps at certain values (might have to zoom out, use the +/- buttons), this is because people like to pile up sell orders at specific price points (also referred to as walls).  The price cannot climb above these price points until all of these bitcoins are bought first.  You can mouse over the graph and see how much you'd have to pay, or how much you'd receive if you filled all those orders.
Above the central graph is a price graph over time.  It shows how the price has changed in the last few minutes/hours/days.  Green means the price went up in that timeframe, red means it went down.  The grey bars at the bottom show the volume of bitcoins that were sold in that timeframe.
On the right is the trade history. This shows the actual trades occurring on the exchange in real-time.  You can see how much bitcoin was transferred from one person to another, and how much the other person paid for it.  Green means they paid above mid market price for the bitcoins, red means they paid below mid market price.

[This video]( really helped me understand the basics of how bitcoin works and what the blockchain is, but I have a degree in Computer Science so your mileage may vary.  A quick google search for "how bitcoin works" turns up numerous videos that say they are non-technical so you could also try one of those if you don't want to get bogged down in details.
As far as investing, most people use coinbase.com as it is US based, very simple to use, insured, and has an app you can use to buy and keep track of your bitcoins on your phone.  You can easily setup and account now and go buy $1 worth of bitcoin to try it out (though keep in mind the fees are kind of heavy for low amounts).  If you want a more advanced interface you can go to gdax.com, which is the exchange that coinbase uses under the hood (same company), but it requires more proof of identity to setup an account.

I feel like much of this is a problem of semantics.  Could you define what it means for something to be intrinsically valuable?  For me, something is intrinsically valuable if I can use it immediately to improve my life in some way, without having to change it.  Do you agree or disagree with this definition?  For example, cars, a house, food, are all intrinsically valuable.  Gold, dollar bills, and bitcoins are not.


Yes but not an intrinsic one.  If you have to trade it for something else to improve your life, then the thing you initially traded away was not intrinsically valuable.  You can't drive a dollar bill to work or consume it for nutrients anymore than you could a bitcoin.


It takes work to turn gold into something else.  Your work is adding the value to it, therefore by my previous definition of intrinsic value, gold is not intrinsically valuable.  Its only valuable because you can trade it for something else or you can add value to it by doing work on it.


Yes you can:   Also, you can go on to many different exchanges right now and use bitcoins to buy other currencies.  It is a currency that can be used to buy other currencies.
Not to mention that bitcoin has properties that are inherently useful as a currency.  When I was young and played in the woods a lot with my siblings, we tried to use pinecones as a pretend currency.  Lets compare the properties of bitcoins, dollars, and pinecones as a potential currency.
You can't copy or create a bitcoin out of thin air.  There will only ever be 21 million of them.  Mining bitcoins is a process controlled by math.
Its estimated around $70 million is counterfeit.  The federal reserve controls the creation of USD.  As long as you trust the federal reserve this is fine.
Pinecones are all over the damn place (at least where we lived).  The creation of pinecones is controlled by the trees!
**Ease of transfer**:
Bitcoin can be sent directly to any person or entity that has a wallet.  Nobody can stop or reverse the transaction.  You don't have to trust anybody.  
Dollars must travel physically or through a banking system.  Fine as long as you trust the banks.  If they don't like what you are doing, they can stop it or reverse the transaction.  Sometimes mistakes happen and your money is lost, but you are reimbursed or the transaction is reversed.
Pinecones aren't heavy but they are kinda bulky.  You can't really put them in in your pocket.  You need like a wagon or something to cart them around.
Nobody can take your bitcoins unless they have the private key to your wallet.  Where you keep that key (your pc, an exchange, a bank, a safe, your head) is up to the security of that system.
Dollars can also be stored in safes or in a bank. History has shown that banks have done a wide variety of undesirable things with people's money.
Nobody puts pinecones in safes, and you wouldn't be able to fit very many anyways.
Looking at these properties, it seems like bitcoin is the most useful currency and pinecones are the worst currency.  I have no idea why we thought pinecones were a good idea...  Maybe you are fine with the properties of dollars as a currency, but as evidenced by the rise of bitcoin, many are not.


This isn't any different than gold.  You have to take it out of storage to do something with it...

This is assuming the situation doesn't change, which it 100% will change.  Hopefully newer addons to bitcoin will ease the burden.  However, even if the worst case scenario happens and bitcoin drops dramatically, that means that fewer people will be using it and the fees will go down, allowing you to move your (now worth less than before) coins.
People don't realize they are buying in to the beta version of a technology, it says so [right on the bitcoin.org website.](  Need to give it time to flesh out all the features first.  Nobody was expecting it to blow up this fast.

A hunk of iron ore has no inherent value.  Its what you can DO with that iron ore that gives it value.  There are plenty of physical things that have no value because you can't do anything useful with them.  Just because something is physical doesn't mean it automatically has value.  Similarly with bitcoin, by itself it is worth nothing, but what you can DO with a bitcoin makes it valuable.
You can send a bitcoin to anyone, anywhere in the world, and nobody, no government nor bank can stop you.  This adds value because it is easily transferable.
You can prove, via the blockchain, that this bitcoin has never been double spent, and is one of the only 21 million that exist.  Anyone anywhere at any time can prove that you and only you actually own that bitcoin.  Nobody can create a bitcoin out of thin air.  There will only ever be 21 million of them.  This adds value in the form of scarcity.
You can protect it.  Nobody can take your bitcoin away from you unless they have your private key or you willingly give it away.  This adds value in the form of security.
You can trade it for goods and services (there are already many places you can spend a bitcoin) or for another currency, currently ~$12,000.
If none of these properties of bitcoin are useful to you, then of course, it has no value, to YOU. Just like a hunk of iron ore has no value to me, because I cannot do anything with it (aside from sell it to someone who can).  However, many people around the world find these properties of bitcoin exceedingly valuable and thus are paying a lot of money for it as we can see by the constantly rising price.  Sure, some people are only buying bitcoins because they think OTHER people find them valuable, but that does not mean they have no value to anyone.

Coinbase and GDAX are both the same company.  It is located in the US so at the very least they have to respect US laws (like the recent news of them needing to report info to the IRS).  So you can trust them as much as you would any other US-based company (however much that may be).

The amount of bitcoin you have is just a number represented by a series of bits, just like any other number in a computer.  That number is backed up by the crypto algorithms and hashes in the blockchain, meaning nobody can just randomly change the amount of bitcoin they own to just any amount.
To get a little more complicated, what is actually being tracked is not how much bitcoin you have, but which transactions into your wallet have not been used as output transactions yet.  Each transaction stores the amount that has changed hands as well as where it came from and where it went.  So for a wallet to calculate how much bitcoin it has, it must add up the value of all unused input transactions.   Transactions can't be created out of thin air.  For you to send money to somebody, you have to reference which input transactions you are using to send money to them.  Any change is sent back as a return transaction.  This creates a chain of transactions that are all linked together in a giant web.
[This video helped me understand how all of this works, as well as mining and preventing double spending](


The internal software all deals in satoshis (the smallest denomination of a bitcoin).  Presumably, this is to avoid having to run more complex floating point calculations.  The display software just shifts the decimal point to show the value in some other measurement (whole bitcoins, mBTC, or any value you want really).

Bitcoins aren't like bread, you can't just go to the supermarket and buy one.  Instead you have to buy one from another person that wants to sell, but finding other people that want to sell can be time consuming. So people congregate at what are called "exchanges" (such as [GDAX]( in order to "exchange" their currency for another one.
People can set whatever price they want to on this exchange.  I can go on an exchange right now and say I'll pay $1 for 10,000 bitcoins, but nobody will sell to me because there are tons of other people with much better deals.  In fact, the exchange automatically sorts all the deals by order of price and puts them into two categories, sell orders (supply) and buy orders (demand).  Where these two meet is called the "Mid Market Price".  Which is what everybody talks about as the price of bitcoin going up/down all the time.  Almost 100% of the time, the difference between the lowest sell order and the highest buy order is $0.01, meaning we can easily pinpoint what exactly the current mid market price is.
The price changes as supply and demand changes.  Imagine if tomorrow a research journal came out proving that bitcoins cured cancer.  Demand would skyrocket but supply would stay the same (or go lower as people hoard them for their newfound ability).  What do you think would happen to the price?  Well it would go up of course because tons of people want to buy and nobody wants to sell.
Conversely if tomorrow an article came out proving that there was a major security hole in the bitcoin algorithms, demand would plummet, and supply would increase drastically as people try to get rid of their coins.  What would happen to the price?  It would plummet because demand has evaporated and supply increased drastically.
Price is all about supply vs demand.

Lots of people like to post buy/sell orders at evenly numbered or easily divisible price points (15,000.00 rather than 15,235.75).  This means lots of orders stack up at these prices causing "walls" or cliffs on the price graph rather than a smooth transition.  For the price to move past this point, all these orders must be filled.  Hence there is a wall that the price must pass first.

Not entirely true, in fact you could easily see which wallet the thieves transferred the funds into and then watch what they do with it.  Authorities could alert all exchanges that any transactions dealing with the wallet in question are fraudulent and that they should report anyone who attempts to use the funds or attempts to exchange it for another currency.
For an ongoing development of the exact scenario you are talking about, keep a close eye on what happens to the funds that were just [today stolen from nicehash.com](  Allegedly all of the stolen bitcoin is sitting in [this wallet](  As you can see, literally anybody can see where they transfer the money to.  The tricky part is figuring out who the wallet belongs to. As soon as they start to use the money to interact with the real world authorities could start to piece this together depending on how they use it.
This is also good proof that money in your wallet is safe as long as you don't give out the private key.  If the authorities or nicehash had the ability to reverse the transactions and get their money back, they would have already done it.

No, hes saying too many coins became available too soon.  In the early days it was so easy to snap up hundreds or thousands of coins.  So many coins were introduced so quickly that they had hardly any worth.  Then interest in crypto spiked and quickly turned people that had thousands of nearly worthless coins into millionaires.  When they suddenly dropped those vast amounts of coins on the market it caused turmoil.  
If bitcoins were doled out more slowly then there would be fewer people from the early days holding large amounts of them, causing less volatility in the price as they wouldn't be able to suddenly dump large amounts of coins on the market.  Things might've been more stable and the price might've risen at a steady and stable pace instead of the vast ups and downs we've seen in bitcoins history.  This is all speculation of course, and there are many other factors that have caused the volatility in bitcoins price, but this is at least part of it.
Put another way, in the early days, there was tons of supply and hardly any demand.  Supply then increased at a slower and slower rate (mining rewards being halved), whereas demand has shot up exponentially.  At some point demand crossed a tipping point where supply increases just couldn't keep up anymore, and the initial supply from the early days also wasn't enough.  This is why the price has increased so much recently and why many believe it will continue on its exponential trajectory.  Price is all about supply vs demand, and supply is only going to slow down more and more.  Where demand goes, who knows?

Someone hacked nicehash.com and stole ~$60 million dollars worth of bitcoin.  People are tracking where he is moving the bitcoins, but realistically there's nothing anybody can to do stop him from moving them where ever he likes.  It is currently unclear if he can be stopped from selling/trading them for some other form of currency.  Its possible someone is watching the bitcoins in your friends wallet as well, but highly unlikely.
HOWEVER, if your concerns are serious, and/or the bitcoin amount is rather large, **you should absolutely talk to a lawyer.**

You don't NEED to do anything with it, but people recommend moving it to a wallet you own for security.  Other exchanges have gone down and been hacked (see Mt Gox or Nicehash) so this paranoia is not without precedence.


You can lower/remove the coinbase fees if you move the funds to a GDAX account first (GDAX is the exchange that runs under the hood of coinbase, both owned by the same company).  You'll still have to pay the bitcoin transaction fee though if you want it done in a timely manner.  This will most likely be prohibitively expensive for repeated transfers of low dollar amounts.  Better to move it in large batches.


Yes.  If you plan on day trading its not worth the hassle of sending it to a wallet and back to the exchange to sell shortly thereafter.  Most people move it to a wallet because they plan to hold onto it for a significant amount of time (months/years).  The market is quite volatile, so if you don't have the stomach to hold crypto for a while I'd advise you not to get involved.  You'll just lose your gains to fees/taxes as you transfer it all over the place.  Also rapid (&lt;1 year) buys/sells will incur short term capital gains taxes (assuming you are in the US) which is higher than long term (&gt;1 year) gains taxes.


This is why people are simply holding onto crypto and waiting for the usability issues to be worked out.  Once things are fixed it will be much better.  The early internet was inconvenient (remember dial up?) and look where we are now.  The only problem is nobody knows which coin will win the race and fix all the problems first.

My understanding is that unverified transactions sit in a waiting area called the "mempool".  Miners gather up an assortment of unverified transactions into a block and begin mining it for the hash value.  Whoever finds the right hash value gets the reward and the verified block goes on the blockchain, causing all transactions in that block to now be "verified".
I suppose it is possible that this "mempool" could become too large for the server to store, but I've no idea how large it'd have to get, and I'd imagine that depends on the hardware.
You can see the current amount of transactions sitting around waiting to be verified [here](

First of all, why?  Dollars don't have an intrinsic value, yet we use them to store it.
Second of all, why do you say bitcoin has no intrinsic value?  If I gave you a machine that could securely teleport gold bars or dollar bills to any person in the world, wouldn't that be valuable by itself?  Bitcoin isn't just a number stored digitally in a computer somewhere.  It is a token that grants you access to that machine.  A machine that can send value to anybody anywhere without anybody being able to prevent it.  People are just having a hard time agreeing on how much that token should cost.

Can you take the bitcoins out of the note?  Or is the only way to spend them to physically hand the note to somebody else?  If so its kind of pointless...
If you can take the bitcoins out of the note, can you also put them back in?  If so how is this different from any other hardware wallet?  The denomination printed on the note is meaningless because it may or may not actually contain that (sure they said you can validate its contents with a smartphone, but still).
If you can't take the bitcoins out of the note, isn't this technically destroying bitcoins?  Eventually the physical note will be lost or the hardware will fail.  Once that happens the bitcoins it contained are irretrievable.
One of the quotes says "Physically hand over the whole wallet together with the blockchain **private key**."  Does this mean the private key is handled separately from the note?  How do I know that the person doesn't have a second copy of the private key and will remove the bitcoins from the note after they trade me the note?

Its way too quiet. I maxed out the sound on youtube and could just barely hear it.   Then when the other guy starts speaking around the 7 minute mark it sounds very garbled with lots of static (that's as far as I made it in the video before I gave up).    Also, there are lots of pauses and "um's" that slow down the explanation, although it seems like this is a classroom video so I suppose that can be forgiven.  
Hope this helps you improve your future videos!

Quick google search said all bitcoins would be mined around the year 2140.

I like this video a lot better.  The one the OP linked has terrible audio and is 3x longer to explain the same thing.  Thanks!

You would need something like **300 million** satellites that are a **square mile in size** to take up all the space in LEO orbit.  There is plenty of room.
