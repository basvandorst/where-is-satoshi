Tried to buy the bundle as usual, but no more bitcoin payment option available :(
Had problems with their coinbase payment last time and sent a support request. Seems like they removed it now?!

Thanks for the reply.

Is there something a non-developer not knowing any developers can do?
Should someone create a list of companies/representatives we should contact and ask for support?
@_date: 2013-05-21 15:57:37
could you give a rough scetch that leads you to these numbers (1600 USD rig -&gt; 70 USD a week after elec)?
Mining calc. says 1.8 GH/s before elec. will give 70 USD a week at the moment.

How did you come up with that number?
He used android wallet as well, and while we were waiting I was wondering what possibilities he had to undo the transaction.
He used Android wallet as well, and I saw how he started the transaction (he scanned my QR). Then I saw it as unconfirmed on my phone. He didn´t strike me as technically versatile. But let´s consider that was just a mask.
The only thing I could come with, was that he had some very fresh invalid coins transferred to me. But for that he would need to modify his android wallet first?

First two paid for themselves after a week. Sweet! Keep them for a couple more weeks, and sell them before the market gets flooded and diff goes through the ceiling.
I´d sell them for BTC and pick up only, but then that depends on where you live...

I had good experiences with localbitcoins, medium with gox (weeks for a SEPA), bitcoin-central frozen but got the money after a while, bitcoin.de next day, and I am trying out kraken right now.
I totally agree with your fears about localbitcoins and I think many share them.
I am surprised that transparent information on exchanges is not of more concern to rest of the community?! 
@_date: 2013-10-09 10:42:59
Agreed! However: The more exchanges the marrier them bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-20 08:36:32
They don´t need to build them. They have enough money to buy them.
Say they got the blue-prints, could they (secretly) manufacture ASICs?
@_date: 2013-09-19 08:41:44
great reply :)
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:13:47
So if they actually gain control of a pool, it´s more likely that they would try do divert that pool's rewards?
Anyway, I agree with the gentleman that in regard of pool mining it is quite centralized. 66% of the hashing power in three pools seems quite vulnerable to me.

That makes sense.
@_date: 2013-05-22 08:12:32
Thanks for explaining. This seems legit for 1.6k USD, and it has the strong benefit of having the actual hardware at hand. The benefit I see with Mining shares is that. 1) Scalability: You can invest $1 or $100k (though it will be expensive to buy that many shares) while with a rig you can only add/remove GPU´s. Plus you need the extra components to actually run them, so there´s another steep step. 2) You don´t have the effort of getting the rig up and running (and keep it running).

@_date: 2013-05-22 11:13:24
Thanks for letting me know! Does this one work? Can I change the original, or should i delete &amp; replace it?
@_date: 2013-09-02 20:43:36
Yeah. Simplified too much. But that should be explained later, not in the first step.
@_date: 2013-05-23 08:45:12
Guess I will do that next time. That way I can also build a reputation there.

Their verification process was very smooth and easy. Almost too easy if I think of other exchanges that were taken down because of AML and KYC.
@_date: 2013-09-03 20:55:42
1) much less text, more meaningful explaining graphics
2) Don´t explain all the details, stick to the basics
3) Aim for explaining it to a six year old
4) If someone is then interested and wants to know more details, you can reference to a good source.

The chinese exchanges add up to about 15k trade volume.
Please include them.
@_date: 2013-05-22 14:39:56
Exactly. If I get it right, then the Avalon-Chips &gt;should&lt; be available in biq quantyties soon. And someone with credibility could give it a big push into mainstream.
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:36:38
I also talked with him about the possibility of him starting an exchange in Aleppo. Could work like this:
His friends receive BTC from relatives abroad. He exchanges them into local currency so they can use the funds locally. He can use the BTC to pay his suppliers abroad. He then sell his goods locally for local currency.

Right now exchanges are the weak spot in the bitcoin economy. We need more reliable working exchanges. This is ~~the critical~~ a promising path to broader adoption. That`s why we all should carefully try out new exchanges and give them some initial support.

transferted some mBTC in, tried to sell but absolutely no volume. :( Was hoping to try out an EUR / SEPA alternative and see how long the withdrawels take...
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:47:43
Ordered the SEPA transfer on April 24th, so before they went down. Received it last week in my fiat bank-account. :)

I think right now he is importing through the UnitedArabEmirates mostly. I will point him to this thread, hopefully he will answer himself (EDIT: When he´s back online)
@_date: 2013-09-23 23:44:10
They have several verification levels. It seems like there is only automatic checking on the lower levels, no ID or anything needed.

Didn´t notice the bar on the left in the picture, assumed your average would be total over all exchanges.

@_date: 2013-06-08 23:08:11
Please check localbitcoins.com for other countries. Please check where most of the coins get mined. In a lot of countries it is much harder to obtain bitcoins than in US/Europe. How many bitcoins "are in Africa"? As in controlled by People living in Africa? How are they supposed to obtain bitcoins? Send you dollars bei Western Union?

I always feel a little uneasy when I look at this pie-chart: 
2 pools - 50%, 3 pools - 66% - If someone gained control of these pools, would that enable him to control the blockchain?

@_date: 2013-05-18 14:45:14
Valid point!
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:55:02
Interesting. For a fork, someone would need to create a block inside the Syrian intranet?
I find that unlikely, I assume there´s not much mining going on there right now.... From what I gather from my friends, what happens the most is that they get completly disconnected.
Then their transactions would have to wait for validation but wouldn´t get erased?!
@_date: 2013-05-18 08:20:02
I imagine it is technically possible to do a face to face offline transaction and "wire" it when back online.
However, I see the biggest potential with the international transfers. Those won´t work offline.
Don´t think this will be a big drawback. I expect the Syrians are quite patient by now, as downtimes in Aleppo are usual and often last several days.
@_date: 2013-08-09 15:10:27
For small amounts I use my normal smarthphone. Just like with your normal wallet there is always a risk of theft. The extra security of a dedicated wallet would have to come at a smaller size + more local businesses accepting it. So long I am fine with having some change with me. It works for showing off how easy it is.
I would not use a standard ROM smartphone as a wallet for bigger amounts. Especially not old ones. I treat them as not safe, some are known to have Spyware and backdoors installed.
@_date: 2013-05-29 13:17:18
Yes, I think that´s what the OP´s question is aiming at.
