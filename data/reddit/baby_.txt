Do those contributions entitle you to dictate how others spend their time and efforts? I suppose not.
Perhaps if you paid someone to do the work you want them to do, you would have a better claim on their time. Failing that, you could always do the work yourself.

Although, of course, your opinion is just as important as anyone else's, if you're not contributing either technically or financially, what right do you have to make demands on those who are?

If you really want to chase blindly after the this-is-a-crime-because-it's-prohibited-by-law angle, you should probably also note that it's neither your opinion nor mine that determines which acts are criminal, but a series of procedures that are also described in their respective laws, so, no, you can't correctly claim that it's a crime.

Supposing it would have been the same argument without the dead kids, why were they included? It's a naked appeal to emotion, not an argument at all.

For your future reference, if your argument requires the emotional punch of a few dead children, it's probably not a great argument.

One real problem with the APWU is that they get to operate on BOTH sides of the bargaining table. They're workers but they're also 330,000 voters who, together with their friends and family, form a huge voting bloc.

I guess someone forgot to read the article.

That's an interesting explanation, but it's more complex than necessary.
A troll is someone who seeks an emotional response. Many people are invested in or enthusiastic about bitcoin, and they may be hurt or threatened by the sometimes abrasive or dismissive criticisms of outsiders. Thus bitcoin enthusiasts are perfectly primed to have an emotional response to criticism, making them ideal targets for a troll.
It's unnecessary to consider the trolls' actual opinions of bitcoin. Their actions are simply an artifact of the existence of easy victims.

AFAICT it's still illegal to trade virtual currency for goods and services.
Personally I'd like to use BTC to make payments in China with funds originating in the US, but even a small amount of legal ambiguity is enough to make it impractical.

If this is true, it shouldn't be downvoted.

I was considering using BTC to pay contractors in China with funds originating in the US, but isn't there legislation prohibiting exchanging BTC for fiat currency, goods and services?
Are there no problems in practice? At least a few people have told me that BTC is illegal here. Even if it's legal or in a gray zone, it might be harder to convince people to accept it as payment.
Sorry if I'm asking something obvious, but what I'm hearing in China and what I'm reading on doesn't line up at all.

It was quite productive, but those days ended a decade ago.

It could be up to 15 years in prison, or around $6,500 per year at current rates. On that basis, it's definitely a good choice for someone fully employed but earning less than $3.25/hr.
