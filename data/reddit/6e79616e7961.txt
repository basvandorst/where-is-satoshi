New version with same name.
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:45:51
At least tell us why you think that.
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:45:16
Because he is openly declaring war on the current establishment.

,,Grandpa, Grandma, I know I'm supposed to treat you with respect and everything. But right now you two are so full of shit I can't even properly communicate to your "informed" asses. Go pick up a wallet and read more on the internet instead of news papers. If you still feel the need to think of me as dumb, we can continue this talk. Until that moment I would like to call you both sheeps with attitude."
@_date: 2016-03-28 14:28:58
There is no ,,one or the other". There is only ,,me and the rest" it seems. We all want privacy, but we also want perfect protection. These two don't go hand in hand. We all know that. We also love all the new features tech companies offer us, but we don't want to exchange our info for it or at least, not to everyone, just in case it falls into the wrong hands. I believe we can throw away the concept of privacy if everyone made sure that our info wouldn't fall in the wrong hands in the first place. OR, we can choose for 'safety' and give all our data to everyone, but then all issues arise once more. It's like we keep shoving our issues to the next generation because we all like to procastinate.

Unpopular opinion: privacy only stands in our way as whole.
@_date: 2016-03-28 13:28:14
If we are to cure certain diseases, physical or mental, optimize our society even further; stuff like that.
For instance, if we are to integrate the internet in ourselves, it will probably mean giving the world access to parts of our psyche.
Privacy is in my eyes, after my years of advocating for it, a lost battle. There has to be a better way of safeguarding our rights as living beings than keeping secrets?
It is such a difficult discussion because at one side, there is this part of me that agrees with the existence of privacy. On the other hand there is the neutral me that doesn't give a shit and just wants progression by any means necessary. 
Tell me what you think, and your potential solution to this beverending battle.
@_date: 2016-03-28 12:55:47
I couldn't care less about the reasons the big guys use to eat away privacy. What I care about is how we expect to progress further into the realm of science when privacy will only hold us back (massive amounts of data mining are necessary). Or are there any alternatives?

Nice b8 m8
@_date: 2016-01-03 20:24:56
Doesn't that mean that yet again an idea meant to liberate people has been perverted and only serves those with financial power?
@_date: 2016-06-13 17:09:14
Judging by your use of m8 I'm going to stop taking you seriously from now. Okay. Let's sum this shit up. The guy asks whether he should deposit money in coinbase, since he's fearing it might be a scam. Your response is to diversify. You didn't assure him whether it was a scam or not. Secondly, you, as the fool you're acting as, tell me to go back to school because I modestly tell you that wasn't what he wanted. He is asking assurance **firstly** because he's not sure. In other words, the part describing whether he should is an indirect way of asking if we can tell him if it's safe. My interpretation is correct. Critical thinking? Not needed in this situation, so put that one back where it came from. Metaphor is the one you used, and since it's not what he wanted, it remains useless. 
Either way, you wasted a good 5 minutes of my life even though you advised (indirectly) to diversify and put money in it. In the end, I'm pretty sure your comment didn't bring the guy anywhere. But this comment is also making me look like an asshole so thanks for that.
@_date: 2016-06-13 11:57:23
Going back to school doesn't count as an insult, at least I'm sure 90% of mankind will disagree with you. Also, it's a scam. Advising someone to put money in a scam, even if it's a little bit is shitty advice. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 08:09:41
Still, less worse than making an advice animal and screwing up it's spelling. Besides, how very kind of you to point that out for me. That is indeed;;; supposed to be a comma.
@_date: 2016-06-26 16:50:44
I wrote decentralize but I meant centralize. Sorry!
@_date: 2016-06-29 08:20:58
Currently not a Bitcoin user, but I highly value it's existence. How big are the odds some sort of shill group suggesting these kinds of changes to devalue the Bitcoin system? Little bit tinfoily but we all know the current establishment is willing to do crazy things to stay in power?
@_date: 2016-06-12 17:03:51
This is an article about it, I found some more by searching for 'coinspace scam' on google. It seems that it holds similarities to a pyramid scheme. Not sure though. I'd watch out. of all the links I've found most of them are questioning the validity of said service.
Watch your step.
@_date: 2016-06-12 16:37:42
You know, that wasn't his question. 
@_date: 2016-06-27 10:13:52
I'm from the nineties. And I honestly didn't know about the TODL thing.
@_date: 2016-06-27 08:44:57
Ah! You completely destroyed my insult. Damn you, grammar.
@_date: 2016-06-26 17:50:27
Because is a word.
@_date: 2016-06-27 05:36:02
I couldn't find a good excuse so I used a quote from Reggie Watts.
@_date: 2016-06-08 14:47:53
Just don't do it. It's useless at this point. 
@_date: 2016-06-26 15:52:14
Yeah, so let's decentralize it so big companies and banks and governments can use it against us like usual. Or is that a stupid thought?
@_date: 2016-06-27 07:42:38
What if I told you; you can't write a proper sentence.
@_date: 2016-09-04 08:07:52
Time to search for a new social media website to register with. It seems Reddit has already lost the war of being infested with useless scammy maggots like you. Go back to G+ or wherever the hell you came from.
@_date: 2016-09-19 09:19:09
Nice and everything but I get arrested when I try to cross the border so what's the point of a country I'm not allowed to enter? I would give a lot to just escape the shit I'm tormented by in my own country but up until now Liberland seems like a lot of talk.
@_date: 2016-09-19 09:27:01
No you'll get arrested by border patrol if you try to get into Liberland because it's not a recognized state/country.
@_date: 2016-09-09 10:48:38
No need to get accusive. They're trying to find out if it's doable to start a wallet for customers.
@_date: 2016-09-02 05:33:37
Remember how people didn't want cryptocurrency to be accepted as legal tender on both government and civilian side? Now that is coming to hunt you. Those people barely understand what bitcoin is. Let alone help you. 
@_date: 2016-09-18 19:27:06
The way she articulates really annoys me ;(
@_date: 2016-05-20 07:51:39
Keep it you idiot. Or stop trolling.
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:12:27
TIL drugs are an absolute evil and that is never goin to change.
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:20:45
I think you are exaggerating a bit. They aren't the smartest, not the brightest.
@_date: 2016-07-13 15:46:01
Can we impose anti money laundering regulations on the E.U. as well?
@_date: 2016-07-31 08:25:08
No one lives there. You get arrested if you try to cross the border.
@_date: 2016-07-31 10:59:57
Because Liberland is not officially recognized by Croatia. It seems they want to use it as a pawn but don't admit it. 
@_date: 2016-07-19 10:46:56
How do we stop governments and banks from gaining too much influence and power of the network? I can clearly see that they are trying to ruin everything again with their bureaucracy and meddling.
