Yup, it is right. The amount at risk is bounded and small.

We have spent some time theorizing but we need to write some things down (we need to add some text to the game theory trees and the like). We are on it

It is a tradeoff. You get more privacy and keep control over your bitcons.
And, there are payment processors with hard (irreversible) payments as OKPay.

Apart from deals with payment processors you can provide additional optional services such as 2-of-3 signatures with a Coinffeine oracle among other things.
It is almost impossible to make money from the basic functionality of a P2P network by itself but not from its ecosystem.

The tracking problem is a real one but I think that the existence of many payment processors alleviate it. On the other hand, the rest of the setup can be used with traditional wire transfers so the project can eventually pivot if necessary.
The trust problem is universal in this domain. How many people you know that have studied the bitcoind code? Or the TSL implementation used by your browser? Anyway, I agree 100% on the seriousness of dealing with money.

First one to be supported: OKPay

We started with Java but switched to Scala to have a nicer time with Akka actors.

One by one :)
Role of the server module. Coinffeine version 1.0 will be completely decentralized but we are building it incrementally and some aspects (the order book) are not going to be decentralized until the exchange part is completed.
How many payment processors will be supported. As many as we can or the people will contribute. We are designing for pluggable payment processor support and as long as a payment processor meets some criteria (like non reversibility) it is welcomed. The first one will be OKPay.
Access to payment processors. There is a tradeoff here. With payment processors we can have a nice user experience and create something useful for some people. The concept can be extended to other payment forms, different from payment processors like regular wire transfers by sacrificing time and user experience but we want to focus on the first use case for the moment.
How fast are the payments. With our envisioned scheme, a maximum time window measured in blocks is known beforehead. We are talking of a process that is likely to be on the range of hours. We like to think about it like the early days of P2P file downloading, you select what you want and let your computer work while you sleep.
You cannot avoid a user dropping the ball on one of the rounds. But you can avoid it to be profitable by creating deposits that will be lost in that case. We will publish a whitepaper with a detailed analysis of the problem.
How to protect against a powerful adversary. I totally love the design principle of GNUnet that states that the damage performed by an attacker is sub-proportional to its bandwidth (very similar to the insight behind the 51% attack). If such adversary tries to start lots of interchanges he will need a lot of computing power (we will use a proof of work to protect against sybil attacks) and they will lose about the same amount of money than the people. I think it is a reasonable security tradeoff.
We have thought about that. You can have a backup node (yours or provided by a third party for a small fee) holding just the enough information for making an emergency stop without losing the deposits of either part.
Wooo, that was a lot of text, sorry!

Logo designer here. You are totally sick!

They use a payment processor (something of the same category of PayPal or OKPay) and they might add wire transfers for banks in the future.

The model is open to incorporate as many payment processors as possible (among the ones supporting hard payments)
