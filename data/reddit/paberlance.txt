No, I'm not talking about refunding the 2nd layer. 
I wish to open many LN channels using just one  batched transaction on the bitcoin  blockchain.
Essentialy batching multiple multisig transactions into one.

Would it be possible to use one batched transaction to open multiple channels at once  with just one on-chain transaction? 
I already asked this question in an other reddit post here, but there are still no concrete answers or ideas on this. 
This seems so obvious to me and there would be no reason not to open more than one channel for better routing options paying just one single fee to open those paymentchannels. 
Can anybody enlighten me on this?

I asked a similar question here:
 
Was  about batching transactions for opening channels. Unfortunately nobody explained if it is possible yet.

Do you know what technology/technique is needed to achieve that? Can you point me to some papers or links describing this idea?

Via custodial third party app

You deposit via SEPA, you recice Bitcoin on a address of your choice. 
They don't do ID check, but require money coming from a personal bank account.

Great solution! Works with existing rules, no need to change anything, just needs to be adopted by wallets and users who want to use it. 
What most impressed me is the ability to cryptographically proof that a payment was made to the recipient and not another fake address presented to be paid to by someone else.
Looking forward to see that idea evolving and actually beeing implemented somewhere.

I will let anyone know about the positioning of Bitstamp. 
Thank you for your help!

This is huge! An open source, great UI, backend for controlling your Lightning node. 
Hopefully this  hopefully will help in decentralisation as users could easily run their own installation and manage them at home with their own hardware. Censorship resistant, ultra fast, low fee and secure. Run by you on your raspberry. wow!

1. Not SMS,  2FA was timebased Authy 2FA
2. No, I think my phone was not hacked.
3. No, didn't think so either.
Comment to 1: The 2FA was disabled by Bitstamp itself. So there was no 2FA active when the attack happened. I consider this the main reason and it's their main fault in this case. And one again: How do thei dissable 2FA and authorize full withdraw of the balance?
Note: See the attached Screenshot of the Bitstamp Logs

Yes, I had API acess to a Sub-Account that I used for Bot trading. 
But asking to remove 2FA via API?
@_date: 2017-10-07 14:59:14


no, that was not the case. The 2FA was disabled by the exchange itself, as you can see in the logs. "Administrator disabled 2FA"

I use this app, send and receive enabled.
