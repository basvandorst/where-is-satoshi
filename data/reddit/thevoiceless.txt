1. It was a backup email provider
2. Coinbase has nothing to do with SendGrid
3. See 1 and 2

Yeah I agree that's probably better wording, I was just going off of what the coinbase people in this thread were saying

I don't think so, but Mycelium is

Localbitcoins is your only option, literally. Anything else that involves exchanging with fiat is going to need a bank account, which will require verifying your identity.

Yep, pretty much where I am now. Oh well :/

Right, but you can't add to it when offline

Don't they have to have a Coinbase account for that to work?

Cool, thanks!

You keep saying they get millions of dollars per month; where are you getting that number?

I'm not sure what's available to Canadians.
Buy low, sell high, but don't buy more than you can afford to lose. That's all. No one knows what price to buy at, otherwise we'd all be doing it.

@_date: 2013-12-06 02:12:27
Ah, I see. I don't really think it's an issue, but I get what you mean
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:19:07
I think you're absolutely right, and the issue definitely falls under the greater "ease of use" issue facing bitcoin. The average person needs an easy way to get, spend, and convert it.
@_date: 2013-11-24 22:40:46
If $200 is really all you have left to your name, no, I don't think you should invest in a still-experimental, fluctuating currency.

I love open source software as much as the next guy, but seriously, people need to stop assuming that just because it's open source means that some independent third party has reviewed the code. Note that I mean this in a general sense, I'm not trying to say Clipperz isn't safe

I haven't used Electrum, but I've been using MultiBit for a little while and have no complaints.

Out of curiosity, why are you sort of "the" charity to donate bitcoin to? Is it because no other charities accept it?
@_date: 2013-12-19 23:53:17
Why din't the non-hidden tip work? I assume because "3 lambos" isn't valid?
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:52:32
You are not "in essence" buying coin directly from them, you *ARE* buying coin directly from them. They buy from the different exchanges and then sell to you (and vice-versa). They exist due to the lack of easy USD/BTC conversion for most of the exchanges.
I'm not disagreeing with you, I'm just saying that there's really not all that much we can do. Bitcoin and all related services and institutions are still in their infancy. You may be able to contact Coinbase and voice your concerns, or you could head over to and see what you can do there (I doubt Coinbase monitors the subreddit, though).
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:39:08
Why the "HD"?

Whoa, those are awesome
@_date: 2013-11-24 00:04:26
Thanks for this.
Do you take requests? I've been trying to figure out what the difference is between password-protecting a wallet and encrypting a wallet, and how public/private keys are involved in the whole process.

As far as anyone can tell, Coinbase seems legit. They wouldn't get very far otherwise. That said, I created a separate checking account to use with them.

Click on the "WTF?" in the top right hand corner, it gives an explanation for everything (I asked the same thing when I first saw all that).
Keep in mind that all of the numbers are in mBTC, not full bitcoins.

Why are Bob's and Alice's private keys included in their URLs? Doesn't that defeat the purpose of them being private?

Ohhh okay, I guess I totally misunderstood how the whole process works. Thanks!
@_date: 2013-11-24 01:52:48
But it sounds like there are/can be multiple of each kind of key?
I've read that page, and it makes it sound like encrypting your wallet is the same thing as password-protecting it. Is that true? When people say "encrypt your wallet", I don't know if they're saying I should have a password on it or if I should encrypt the wallet file itself.
It doesn't help that I don't see a common wallet file scheme. MultiBit appears to use a ".wallet" file, whereas Bitcoin-QT appears to use a ".dat" file. MultiBit says it stores your keys in the .wallet file, too.
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:40:21
You're completely correct. In terms of usability, I see bitcoin becoming mainstream in two ways:
1. Many many years down the road when the population is mostly people who grew up with computers and understand the basics of how they work. As much as we'd like to think otherwise, there are still a TON of people out there in first-world countries that aren't computer-literate enough to understand the concepts of files, encryption, networks, etc. 
2. The protocol and tools mature to the point where the average person can understand and use it without an intricate and involved explanation. Some would argue that you need to be taught how to use current monetary systems, but keep in mind that you really don't need anything for basic usage. The concepts behind paper money are fairly intuitive, and you can read an explanation of debit and credit cards in a few sentences. Bitcoin requires some research and/or usually asking someone who already knows about it, just to get started. Even then, what's the best wallet client? What's the best online wallet? Which exchange should they use, if they want to use one? There are too many options and details for someone who is not technologically inclined.
As it stands right now, bitcoin is honestly relatively hard to use. Sure you can send BTC easily, but first you have to explain or hide the details of what you actually do to "send" it.
I think the solution (if there is one) will likely be a bit of both. 
Even if all of the usability issues are solved, though, NOTHING will happen until it becomes easier to exchange fiat for BTC. Regardless of what some proponents may think, it is NOT easy/obvious/intuitive right now and fiat is not going anywhere anytime soon, like it or not.
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:57:32
Is there an explanation somewhere of how to read the transactions on blockchain.info? I've tried and I have no idea what I'm looking at. 
I can see that green arrows show received bitcoins and red arrows show sent ones, but what are the red/green buttons on the right side of each row? On all of the received transactions, the value on the button matches the number of bitcoins received. But the values on a lot of the sent transactions don't add up. Can someone explain?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:23:48
I'm not the person you replied to, but can you explain all this stuff about keys? All I understand is that I've added a password to my wallet in MultiBit, and when I want to receive BTC I provide a specific address that the other person sends to. Where do private/public keys come in, and how are they different from the wallet itself?
@_date: 2013-11-26 00:41:37
What's the difference between a ".dat" wallet and a ".wallet" wallet? I haven't used Bitcoin-QT but it looks like it uses the .dat file, whereas MultiBit uses the .wallet file.
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:47:37
It has something to do with throwing off bots, I don't know the exact details
@_date: 2013-12-05 19:11:37
As far as I know, Apple has been pretty harsh about not allowing any bitcoin apps
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:31:05
No, you get what is usually referred to as "dust".
Not only to you get dust, but it takes a long time to store up enough dust to overcome the transaction fee, let alone get any significant amount of BTC. Also, a lot of the sites like that have a "minumum payout" amount, meaning you'll have to gradually build up to a certain amount before they'll give you anything. Depending on the site, getting to that amount could take days or weeks or months.
It's too late to mine unless you already have a dedicated ASIC. Just buy coins that already exist.
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:46:14
Definitely, some command line output at the very least

But how will you see it? It's dark when you close your eyes!
@_date: 2013-11-26 07:03:15
Oh I see, I didn't get that Multibit stores the keys in the wallet file so I was confused as to why you were talking about the file format
@_date: 2013-12-14 17:36:43
Oh I see, I wasn't thinking about those, only FF
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:30:18
What actually happened, then? I didn't see the news about China until today, so I have no clue what's really going on...
@_date: 2013-12-07 01:49:22
No. You probably won't even make $1 per week.
You've come in at a bad time, most of the places to buy bitcoin are a bit crazy right now. When things settle down you can check out the major exchanges (Mt. Gox, Bitstamp, BTC-e) and/or Coinbase (I'm assuming you're in the US). Coinbase is the easiest, you sign up and verify your bank account, then you can buy from them at the rates they set. Their website is having issues at the moment, though. Exchanges are a bit different, and someone else would have to explain them to you as I don't use them.
@_date: 2013-12-28 20:06:40
Looks like Clipperz is not free, and it's not an offline password manager
@_date: 2013-12-08 03:35:32
I wish I were as wise as you
@_date: 2013-12-06 21:29:03
Well, Coinbase does. Keep in mind that their business is based around a still-experimental currency. They'll probably loosen things up if BTC becomes more mainstream.
As for your friends and your experience...oh well. Such is the state of BTC at the moment.
@_date: 2013-12-03 22:06:19
I'm not sure why your mining isn't working (or if it is), but as far as I know, mining is pretty pointless at this point. You won't gain any significant amount and will probably pay more for electricity.
@_date: 2013-11-24 19:05:36
Maybe he's not talking about USD? I dunno
@_date: 2013-12-06 01:25:03
What's wrong with that? Isn't it one? I see people complain about it but I've never understood why
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:32:42
Don't try to time the market, you will fail. Buy some and hold, or buy some and just wait until they go up/down and stabilize. There's no good way to do what you want, and trying to speed-trade in bitcoin doesn't work (plus it undermines using it as a regular currency).
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:34:18
Up/down numbers are fudged, only the overall total is guaranteed to be correct
@_date: 2013-12-07 02:55:05
I guess I shouldn't have said it doesn't work. It can be done, but it's not easy. Exchanging fiat for BTC is a bit of a pain at the moment, and even after you've got money in one of the exchanges they're not always instant. For example, Mt. Gox can have lag times ranging from seconds to many minutes. A fluctuation of $20 is **extremely** common, so it will be really really hard for you to trade in such small intervals.
That's why I said to buy and hold and wait for the price to stabilize. For example, you could buy at $820 and the price might bounce up and down while gradually moving up closer to $900 (just an example).
@_date: 2013-11-27 18:48:00
Honestly, it's your fault. The mantra for bitcoin is "don't invest more than you can afford to lose".
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:56:51
I'm confused, you guys have Honey for Firefox already...
@_date: 2013-11-21 22:02:17
Installed the .deb successfully, but nothing happens when I run cycle-launcher

@_date: 2013-12-07 02:07:14
I mentioned this is my other comment, but you touch on the only thing that's good right now: It's (usually) easy to spend BTC. I think the more "advanced" stuff like wallet addresses, transaction confirmations, etc. could probably be glossed over a bit for the average user.
That's the endgame, though. People need to be able to get to that point. I don't even think it's "simple over the long run".
An exercise: Write instructions for my dad to get set up with BTC. You don't know anything about him (I assume), and that's the point. The process should work and be understandable by anyone.
How do you protect your money? "Oh, I didn't know what that file was so I deleted it."
Who can you go to if it's stolen? "What do you mean there's nothing I can do?!"
Tell him how to spend it. "Sending and receiving address? What's that? Why can't I just enter my card number?"
These are things that we need to figure out how to explain to the average person.
@_date: 2013-12-11 15:55:55
Boo hoo
@_date: 2013-12-13 13:55:06
They have an extension for Firefox too...
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:26:26
They're a broker, not an exchange, and aren't suited for quick buy/sell turnover. The rest of the stuff I agree with, especially the bit about not being told you'd be locked out until the first purchase completes. I missed the climb to $1000 because of that.
Aside from that, I've had no issues with their site the past few days, and I definitely like that they allow you to "lock in" the price you buy at. Sure, that means you could lose out if the price drops after you buy, but at least you don't have to worry about the price rising.
Also, I assume they don't let you sell the coins because you don't technically have them yet. If they did, people would actually try to use Coinbase as an exchange and string together tons of buy/sell orders before any actually finish.
