You have a choice, but as an individual, the government would see no problem in just murdering you/locking you up. If a few million people collectively refused to pay taxes however, I think the gov't wouldn't have such an easy time putting them down.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:02:13
You obviously think you're some sort of intellectually superior person who's viewpoints are the only "true" way of seeing the world. 
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:57:32
My honest opinion? Soldiers are people, and "selective apathy" is a well known phenomenon amongst human beings. The Rape of Nanking is an example of this. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:52:35
In my honest opinion, without government technology would advance much faster and therefore transit by slabs of asphalt would become obsolete.

Even police wouldn't massacre civilians en-masse

That's just how statists think. Fight fire with... Flamethrowers and napalm bombs.
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:41:55
This is most likely true. However, that's kind of the point of bitcoin, isn't it? To be able to freely use your hard-earned currency on whatever you want?

Your ego is enormous.
@_date: 2014-02-08 16:00:10
Lol, you're delusional.

I think a better example would be:
Can you send me $100,000,000 instantly right now with fiat without setting off all kinds of alarms?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:13:47
Thank you.
One would think that the people who use bitcoins, of all the people in the world, would be opposed to funding the state, especially when they don't exactly *have* to, considering the nature of bitcoins.
Government control extends even to those actively reducing it's control... It's a sad thing really.
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:18:40
In some eyes, that's a very positive thing. Why does the gov't deserve my money?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:16:50
Damnit taxes aren't theft, they're extortion. There's a difference.
@_date: 2014-01-15 23:36:34
The tax problem is that it's theft, plain and simple.
@_date: 2014-10-21 16:59:23
I agree with your point but soldiers being unwilling to murder their own citizens is a logical thing not a moral thing. U.s. citizens literally pay their paychecks.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:54:25
Government is not the collaboration of people. It's the collaboration of psychopaths who rape and steal from the people they are supposed to protect.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:15:28
Tax isn't theft, it's extortion. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:21:31
Do you enjoy your job? 
If you do, I believe you might be some sort of sadist.
@_date: 2014-02-08 22:11:27
Well the guy I was responding to said "laundering money" was immoral. I think he was referring to avoiding paying your taxes.
@_date: 2014-10-20 20:56:59
Yeah, that's why I said "A few million people" as in, dozens of millions.
If there are more people refusing to pay taxes than there are soldiers capable of imprisoning them, then a peaceful compromise would have to be made, otherwise the gov't would dissolve due to lack of revenue.

[ex·tort  \(ĭk-stôrt′\)
tr.v. ex·tort·ed, ex·tort·ing, ex·torts
To obtain from another by coercion or intimidation.
If someone doesn't mind paying taxes, does that mean they are no longer under threat of force?
No. Even the most government loving person alive, if they (for some reason) can't pay their taxes, the government will punish them.
@_date: 2014-11-17 18:35:31
The government is not the only entity capable of hiring engineers and planning large-scale construction projects. Things like gas/fuel stations, airports, helipads, docks, large shopping centers with huge parking lots, water and sewer systems, and roads in-between are often built by private companies. If they can do it now, then they certainly could do it in a more liberated future.


Crime investigation and punishment after-the-fact is usually a large waste of time in my opinion. If crime prevention (electronic security systems, civilian-owned arms, maybe even private surveillance of your home by a security company) were the focus, then not only would there be less crime all around, there wouldn't be huge prisons overflowing with non-violent criminals like we have today. The government doesn't just put away bad people, it *creates* criminals by banning victim-less actions such as smoking weed or buying cuban cigars.
The biggest problem with a public police force is, well, they get paid whether they actually do anything worthwhile or not, and your money (taxes) is taken from you whether you actually benefit from it or not. I personally have never been saved by a cop in a bad situation, and neither were my friends who were shot and left to die in the woods a few weeks ago, and yet we all still pay taxes; until we die, of course.

Why are you so close-minded? There are other ways of transportation than just cars and roads that require 0-no infrastructure.

If a system isn't run with violence, it isn't a government. 
@_date: 2014-01-16 01:57:22
Species change over time. It's called "evolution". If we lived in a world that was truly free and all people were independent (relatively of course, I'm not saying community needn't exist) and all interaction was voluntary, the greedier ones of our race would be petty thieves and con-men rather than *the most influential people on Earth*. That's something I could live with, at least for as long as it takes for the greed to be selected against due to it holding no benefit.

Too late, I already called her. Finders keepers.
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:16:05
So, your priorities are theft and murder? Good for you.
@_date: 2014-10-20 19:21:14


There's the kicker ;)
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:18:52
Your point is?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:23:25
You haven't stated a point at all, at any point in this discussion. You're actively avoiding discussion. So for what reason should I intelligently refute what you're saying when the only fact I can deduce from your statements is that you believe extortion is moral?
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:19:59
He's not stealing money from the irs. He's just keeping what is his. That's not immoral.
@_date: 2014-10-20 19:20:31
This is a way of looking at it.
@_date: 2014-10-20 18:50:09
It's still more feasible than doing the same thing with USD. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 02:20:58
That's not sneakiness, that's cronyism. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 05:36:37
Yeah because war-mongering nation-states never murder children or infants.
@_date: 2014-01-16 02:32:06
Not all people with no morality are greedy. And not all greedy people are sociopaths.
How could greedy people acquire influence and power when there are no positions of power for them to take and no way for them to exert their will over others?
@_date: 2014-10-20 19:27:05
Soldiers, unlike their superiors, are not sociopaths and they would not willingly kill American citizens.
@_date: 2019-03-30 21:23:49
That's besides the point though, because even if we were 100% green it would make no difference. The snowball effect is already happening

What if I believe the laws in this country are immoral and harmful to me and my family? What if I believe the "leaders" are evil and undeserving of my money? Why should I do anything to help the same people who have wasted billions of dollars murdering innocent people overseas?

I only have ten dollars to my name right now and it's in my bank account. And quickbitcoins.com is out of stock :(

No fking way

If you don't know how to get around this then you're using bitcoin wrongly.
@_date: 2013-12-01 05:46:34
I was always under the impression that cryptocurrencies main purpose was so that people could freely exchange goods and value without government interference.
