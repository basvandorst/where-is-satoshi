first we have mtgox, and for the record andreas was one of the loudest voices telling people to pull their money out. i'll preface this by saying anyone who tries to invest in the bitcoin space outside of merely holding BTC in cold storage has been burned to a large degree. but i'm just saying andreas was fully *had* by that scammer danny brewster of neo &amp; bee. ver's dealings with shady exchanges go back all the way to bitcoinica.  all of these have been pure and simple bucket shops, game of hot potato, who can sheer the clueless sheep the fastest and pull their money out in time before the exit scam.
i have fond memories of asking CZ if okcoin was manipulating volume figures or engaging in insider trading. CZ vehemently denied all accusations, repeatedly over the course of many months. his integrity is completely shot in my book, and this whole v8 thing is still sketchy although i'm sure it's possible Star Xu knew about v8 and didn't say anything, was just waiting to hang it over CZ's head and scape goat him so that he could do jail time.
none of this excuses okcoin who are hilariously still in violation of numerous laws, manipulating volume figures, front running and stop hunting, lying in an audit, impersonating a lawyer, defaulting on a contract etc etc
every figure tangentially involved in this bucket shop is about to go down in a fiery explosion. i just hope their investors and shills have distanced themselves. that people are still shilling for them is pathetic, if they are shilling because they get kickbacks for the stop hunting and insider trading they deserve to be dragged into court too.
it truly boggles my mind that andreas would want to stake his reputation further on anything within 10 miles of okcoin. to be frank his tweet strikes me as pure nepotism
