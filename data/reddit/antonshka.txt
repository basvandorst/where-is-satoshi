XCP will be burned to create new token for the game. Probably tokens won't leave the platform in the beginning at least... if they are moved internally - no fees are needed, but they can be exchanged. And I agree, XCP transaction fees are outrageous

It appears to me that people tend to underestimate pace of change. Pace accelerates with every new day, every new script, program, gadget and platform. Yes, we can claim, that history repeats. No doubt, sometimes. We always can find parallel or good comparison. That's how our brain works.
Now everything changes way faster. Especially if something becomes trendy.( Think huge phone - Meh, now iPhone 6 - ill take it). I remember 8 months ago having conversation with a friend of mine. He was saying that it will take bitcoin 10 to 20 years to go mainstream. Now his frame shifted to 1-2 years. The funny thing that if or when bitcoin goes mainstream people will promptly forget what they were saying before. And everyone will be " yeah, I (secretly) new that." If or when bitcoin succeeds - everyone would be : yeah - I was early adopter, I got a wallet in  the end of 2015! And only will gently smile with their eyes and say nothing.

Not trolling, just little insight:
I think that it BSN will expose early adopters to additional risk. Risk of getting hacked. Exposing their information. And what is on the other side of risk/rewards ratio? What content can be created or shared that is not on r/bitcoin and multiple other SN ? Don't get me wrong - I love our community and I would love to find more passionate, enthusiastic and nerdy ppl like I am. But there should be other way to do it, without creating extra weakness point. People here value privacy more then you might think. Many of us deleted Facebook accounts... And now new SN ?
hope insight is helpful
@_date: 2014-11-17 16:52:37
Guess that will happen next?! Now since bitcoin is legal in US we will see how much interest it would generate from big players ( banks, trusts, VC). That will be short to medium term indication of momentum and bitcoin direction. Overall  very exciting times are coming

I believe that there will be a huge financial incentive for the last miner contributing to 95% to join. Simply because they can buy Bit coins, and vote later, which most probably will be reflected on the price. Simply because of information assimetry.

The main reason - is that title of your post is manipulative and hence annoying.
Let me elaborate why. It's long, but bear with my and follow my thought, dear OP.
First, thing you say that you doing AMA- subertly saying :" I'm doing a "favor" and psychologically our mind feels kind of obligated already. "Repaying the favor" by answering a question at least. And is fine in many cases. 
However the question is manipulative by itself. You are asking, dear OP, for MAIN reason. Only one. By asking our mind concentrate on one thing, disregarding or deminishing effect of other reasons. ( Think this way: if I asked you to offer 10 reasons that you need something ( let's say Ferrari). I bet that you will struggle even with that "simple" task. And when our mind struggles to do that- you go like :" well, probably, I don't need that). So you, dear OP, FRAMING us. 
The last thing, that the first thing that comes to mind after reading your post title( usually what sticks with us) :"I didn't know". However by your AMA you eliminating that reason.
We don't have to have a reason not to donate/pledge.
TL;DR : Dear OP plugs his start up, saying that it's AMA, using manipulative constructions.

Completely unsustainable ? You are looking at Bitcoin as on business, that would lose money, if there was no miner rewards. However the elegance is in design. It is sustainable by mining rewards. Maybe by 2040 it becomes less sustainable due to decreasing rewards. Maybe. However solution of the problem that doesn't exist right now might be well outdated then.

Here is what original legend says ( from the descroption on trading view):
 Hello Crypto Compatriots,   
It has been quite a while... Glad to be back.   
Tears fill my eyes as I gaze through the ranks... So many comrades have fallen. The 2018 bear market has taken more than lives, it destroyed hopes and dreams.   
Some unfortunate soldiers have given up on the their ideals, forgetting the possibility of a brighter future, one where [Bitcoin ]( the fiat tyranny.   
And there are the ones who stand... You... You and You! The braves are still among us.   
Whether you are a weathered veteran who already knew the tune, or a first timer, blue and angry, fear not!   
It is time to reload, level up, and walk proud, as the story is far from over.   
The honey badger may be beaten up and weary, but he's still standing.   
Speaking of Badger, let's see what future lies for our broken hero.   
Bit followed the long path at the feet of Mt King, too tired to climb, and still determined enough not to give in the [sands ]( the desert of despair. He walked straight for as long as he could. Unfortunately, the road came to an abrupt end. A wall of rocky mountains stood firm ahead, forcing Badger to change directions. His only option was to head south, getting dangerously closer to the dreaded Reklands. home of the infamous Lord Rekt.   
Here is the lay of the land:   
**I - Above 10,000 - Forbidden Eden**   
Beyond the green fields and pastures of the open plains lays one of the most enchanting region of Bulltardia. The Forbidden [Eden ]( its name. Every crop harvested from its soil yields more than any other soil, and the fruits that grow from its trees have a incomparable sweetness. Would Bit reach the Forbidden [Eden ]( he'd be able to rejuvenate and regain the strength that was drained by his [bearish]( journey.   
**II - 10,000 - Wall of Ten**   
Erected by ten thousand men, the wall of ten protects the Forbidden [Eden ]( Lord Rekt's army and other unwanted intruders. Bit will have to find a way through the weall if he wants to reach the Forbidden [Eden ]( either via the gates or over the wall.   
**III - 6000 - VanEck Pass**   
The VanEck Pass is the safest and easiest way to cross the 6K rockies. Unfortunately, the pass is easy to miss and most of the roads that lead to it are in fact straying deeper into the valley, delaying voyagers with twists and turns.   
**IV - 2900\~6000 - Valley of Confusion**   
Any adventurer who sets foot in the valley is immediately covered by a mantle of thick fog. Soon after, they will abandon their sense of logic and perception. It is said that the fog is nothing else but dangerous fumes of Hopium, released by the many geysers peppering the ground. Would Badger stay too long in the area, he might have trouble remembering which way to the moon, or even worse, why he came here at the first place.   
**V - 2800\~2900 - Blood River**   
Legend goes that the river was dug by the hands of Lord Rekt himself, who then poured in its bed the blood of its victims. The river cascades into the great abyss to feed who-knows-what-lies-down-there.   
A crossing boat (and toll taker) awaits at 2880. Let's hope the price to be too high for Badger to accept the ride.   
**VI - 900\~2800 - Rektlands**   
There is nothing friendly about the doomed lands of Rektlands. If you ever pictured hell, that's most likely how it looks like, but worse. Its sovereign, Lord Rekt, feeds on the flesh and bones of the way too many poor souls that venture into those forsaken plains.   
**VII - 1250\~1500 - The Altar of Ultimate Sacrifice**   
Everyone captured by Lord Rekt will be sacrificed to honor the beast. According to the lore, "One will be saved by the light of the Moon at the altar of blood". The so-called prophecy remains a myth, has no one has ever been rescued from the sacrificial knife. Once killed, the victims's body are consumed by Lord Rekt, and their blood poured into the sinister river.   
**VIII - 900 - The Last Hodler**   
The last living soul below known to live below 1K is called the last hodler. Even though he dwells in the land of Lord Rekt, he somehow escaped Rekt's torment by denying his existence. Years of hopium abuse have altered the Last Hodler's reality. Semi-conscious, he spends his day staring at the void of the abyss, physically lost but his mind dreaming the life of a bygone era.   
**IX - sub 900 - The Abyss**   
Nothing comes out alive from it... Nothing. And I don't want to talk about it.   
Will Bit give another shot at the rockies or will he just take the path of least resistance? And for how long?

Oh, bear market. If you are so smart- then just sell and take your fiat, or get some shitcoin.

Did you say after Mt. Gox scam ? Now you are changing the argument. No one said it’s risk free to keep you own bitcoins. But you take your own money. Let’s say with power comes responsibility.

Eric Lambrozo is pretty much only one out of Developers, companies, wallets and bisinesses who is standing up. ( yes, wallets are doing good job coding UASF thing). They are DOING. That's great! And they are being heard by people who more or less understand Bitcoin. But it's time to unzip your mouth.
Get out of you Slack and Telegram, mailing  list and github.
 Why is everyone else wants to remain neutral? Reputation or what?! 
Just get out there and remind us about your vision of Bitcoin. About how you see it in 10 years. Make us excited about the future of Bitcoin again, so we can unite around this vision.
There are so many smart people in the space who are working toward better future. But it FEELS like they are INDIFFERENT. And they are not.
Now you, get out there and be heard! 
P.S. Sorry for caps

Well, if Bitcoin is gold, then national cryptocurrecy is dirt. Abundant and no one wants it.

back then it was going down.
Now it's going up - and it's fundamentally different
@_date: 2017-06-25 14:44:08
Definitely an sell before August 1. Maybe wait till it drops a little, so you can sell cheaper.
