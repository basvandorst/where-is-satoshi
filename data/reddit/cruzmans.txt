This is assuming finex actually blamed the users, which they did not; and assumes finex will start allowing withdrawals, which it has said it would not until they had a better idea.   has been pretty forthright and forthcoming to the extent he can.  Also, the ToS makes clear the user accepts the risk. That's how I would draft it too.  
And note, I have some btc et al. in Bitfinex. I knew there was risk.

Just can't please some folks. Notice how BFX token price has been slowing rising?  Somebody has faith.  I'm hopeful, but skeptical ... yet haven't sold my BFX yet, so apparently more hopeful than skeptical ... for now.

False analogy.  In a parking lot there is no written agreement between the parties memorializing mutual consent ("I have read and agree to these Terms" etc.).  On Bitfinex there is.  You can't use it without agreeing to their Terms of Service.
Most liabilities can be limited contractually, except for personal injury and fraud, and sometimes gross negligence.  (Speaking generally in US/Euro law.)  Contracts can limit liabilities that a sign cannot.  (e.g., when you view Reddit, you are not bound by their terms of use just because they say so.  When you register and agree, then you are contractually bound.)  
That said, I do not know whether there is liability here.  But if there is, it will need to be something more than "oops, we fucked up" negligence.

My operative ethos (easier said than done) is you take your friends and family as they are and roll with it (even if they are idiots).  
Wish I knew about that $12 BTC though ... I would have bought it all up ... (that part was real, right?)

This address has been very very busy.  Mostly the last two days.  My December 2015 deposit ended up there in January, 2016.  I found your post by searching the address.  Not sure what it means though.
