I'm with you on this. Unfortunately people have a heard time viewing this the way we do. 
I also hold the view that the entire blockchain space will indefinitely be inextricably linked to Bitcoin. Layer 2/3 solutions will gradually absorb the best ideas floating out there by alt coins which will likely kill them off. The one coin left standing will be Bitcoin with a few other coins that leverage Bitcoin's security like possibly Factom. 
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:07:45
So if there's 21,000,000 BTC. Then there's 21,000,000,000,000 bits @ $0.015 ea.
Coinmarketcap would have to readjust the coins in circulation according to bits and price them accordingly.
Buying bits in a lightning environment would make Bitcoin cheap again!

Nations can barely agree with each other. Even blocs like BRICS, the EU, the US, the UN, the AU all have their own agendas. 
Bitcoin is a good apolitical settlement instrument for any nation since no single nation, corporation or person controls or can control it. They would all have to play by the same global consensus rules which I think nationals of most nations will find attractive. Politicians and central banks won't like it, but the people on the ground have the power to overwhelm them now.

Contrary to popular belief, I believe the market is *far* more interested in digital gold than payment coins. I believe that's why Bitcoin's price is orders of magnitude higher than any other coin.
If I want to buy coffee, I can use my credit card right now today. So that isn't a problem. Payment coins are not actually solving a significant real world problem in my view. However, if I want to protect myself from the global economy and the fiat system- then Bitcoin's function as digital gold is perfect for this use. It solves a huge problem we've had for far too long... the need for a trustless, secure, transparent safe haven. Moving real gold around securely is expensive and time consuming- just like Bitcoin. Bitcoin has mimicked the gold market extremely well for something that is almost purely abstract.
If I'm right, expect Bitcoin to easily break $1m within 5-10 years.

Why oh why aren't more exchanges and wallets implementing it? This is where the user base is. I'm starting to feel like they want Bitcoin to fail. They're coming off as very anti-Bitcoin by dragging their feet.
@_date: 2017-12-14 06:53:40
Local smaller banks can act as new crypto vaults, that wouldn't be a problem
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:00:40
1. SOON :)
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:07:29
So they're more worried about ethereum than implementing a very hard won Segwit upgrade? Reeks of revenge for the s2x shutdown.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:21:48
If nobody cares about LN. It'll prove the point that the market is after digital gold and not payment coins.
@_date: 2017-12-06 15:56:24
I think Bitcoin will redefine what banks do. They can finally work for us. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:25:09
This should be meme'fied.
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:59:12
Yet many competitors have already implemented.
@_date: 2017-12-19 22:40:20
Exactly this. It merely opens it up as an extra option if there's a market for it. 
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:13:58
Bitcoin is the product of an entire ecosystem now. One which is rapidly growing. I believe each day that passes Bitcoin becomes a more solid investment.
Bitcoin can become a maddening paradox if you think about it too much. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:39:31
ordinary people aren't forex traders. It's going to be politically untenable 
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:46:49
That's subjective and depends on a lot of assumptions. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:43:08
User demand. I can see we're going to have to roll up our sleeves and do something about this.
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:52:17
Fuck yeah Winklevoss! Call em out into the open.
@_date: 2017-12-15 17:39:40
okay cowboy settle down...  
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:15:57
Bitcoin is not going anywhere. It's about to become more powerful than it's ever been.
@_date: 2017-12-31 21:40:37
Happy new year!!
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:43:17
It would be a lot higher if exchanges would implement it.. then we'd virtually get segwit by default.
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:42:32
So what's your point? Bitcoin is useless? please do tell because name dropping a has been does little to persuade. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:30:30
Unless Bitcoin manages to take over and things are priced in Bits. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:38:23


That is a loaded term and assumes malice. Nobody excluded anybody. Bitcoin is open source, permisionless and p2p. That's the point!

What you're failing to realize is we can do a 2mb upsize at any time if the situation gets desperate enough. We've always got the nuclear option.
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:13:14
Any guesses which player ?
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:13:04
I thought as much- I was quietly hoping we'd get some indication of an ETA in that interview, but I get why you steer clear of artificial deadlines which could result in unnecessarily rushed work. We can't afford buggy code at all- it has to be perfect.
In the background I know your team is full steam ahead though!
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:06:45
Luno says they've implemented Segwit for hot wallets, but not yet for cold storage.
@_date: 2017-12-15 15:30:52
In principle I tend to agree but only on the assumption that you're referring to extreme hodlers. The people who may take their coins to the grave. However, more realistically, every hodler has their own respective moon and will begin spending when bills need to be paid. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:20:21
As long as investors don't have to keep jumping from one chain to the next just to stay alive... then I'm all for this!

Basically they have a choice to pick a side now. Betting against Bitcoin never goes well. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:43:48
Indeed, it's economically inefficient to expend mining power on coffee transactions. I think LN is a brilliant scaling solution. And to boot, LN is also the environmentally friendly scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:29:21
And couldn't you just mine your own transaction? 
@_date: 2017-12-16 22:05:11
Which makes many altcoins diluted in so many respects. Every alt out there will eventually be diluted by competing alt coins. Take a look at the smart contract coins springing up like ETH, ETC, EOS, NEO etc...  they're all diluting each others' market share and more will come. But when it comes to our perception of gold, there's only space in our minds or need for *one* digital gold. And I believe Bitcoin has already long since taken root in this perception.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:36:09
May the odds be in our favor ;) 
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:15:22
German "government" can kiss my ass. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:33:38
According to this so-called "savage takedown"... you should sell all your Bitcoin. Bitcoin is completely meaningless and worthless in every conceivable way and you should rather pick an altcoin. /s

What's the withdrawal limit for unverified vs verified accounts?
@_date: 2017-12-04 09:12:51
This isn't the old world. The nature of Bitcoin is pseudo-anonimity. You cannot expect Satoshi to come forward and declare his holdings to satisfy your definition of historical record. We know Satoshi got there first.. long ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:23:21
Ummm, or how about Visa...  which if you're familiar with, you can use today quite cheaply I believe...  so what problem is your "different coin" actually solving? The problem of fast cheap payments has already been solved. It's the digital gold everyone is after. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 18:30:40
Rather I think its getting to that point where it'll be so easy to use we won't need to understand :) 
@_date: 2017-12-24 15:38:05
Would a non-coder be wasting their time attempting to find and report bugs?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:58:12
It's always advisable to diversify :)
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:28:38
It's become really difficult for me to continue supporting 1mb blocksize in today's environment. The network needs relief, we should compete. Why can't we temporarily raise the blocksize and then when LN has propagated sufficiently, bring the blocksize back down?
Why can't we do this? Bitcoin could take too much reputational damage before LN arrives.
@_date: 2017-12-15 16:57:33
Watched it as well, he just scoffed it off as if it were nothing. Very telling.

Nice sample of what a shill would say :) 
@_date: 2017-12-16 21:18:58
At the moment Bitcoin has morphed into digital gold (the market really, *really* wants digital gold- it's not as interested in buying coffee as so many people seem to think). It's expensive, but reliable and secure. Having said that, I do hope it can regain it's currency properties through the proposed scaling solutions.
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:22:31


You do realize that Bitcoin has competition, that different path you're mentioning. We come up with an upgrade, an emotional fight for Segwit for years. We've put in all the time and effort to get this far.. then Coinbase just sits. WTF! We are the ones who *made* Coinbase, and it would be a mistake to isolate Bitcoiners.
@_date: 2017-12-03 09:34:00
Why isn't there a decent competitor to Coinbase I wonder?
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:39:52
Which is why high on chain fees are not an issue with lightning in effect 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:47:03
Plot twist: They want to erode Bitcoin's first mover advantage.
@_date: 2017-12-04 06:16:28
Shower thought. This is why Bitcoin will win. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:55:26
This is exactly why now is the right time to upgrade the blocksize. This would be a positive now in this new context.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:05:39
So the stock market is not a bubble that grows forever and never bursts? please..  this happens everywhere. Bitcoin is the pin and EVERYTHING else is the bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:52:43
And I reckon the broader blockchain revolution is going to make it even more difficult for criminals to function. While making it easier for honest citizens to manoeuvre. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:07:41

But thanks for this, I've learnt what I needed to learn. Your assessment of our point in history is very true. I look forward to positive change and preferably sooner rather than later.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:36:42
The old fashioned way for now.
@_date: 2017-12-13 08:16:05
Such lol you're being downvoted for this. Bitcoin is the fairest *form* of money as the rules are consensus-driven regardless of distribution. I.e. the wealthier cohort in Bitcoin cannot change the rules to suit them like we now have in the fiat world with money printing. This feature obviously escapes them. All Bitcoiners have to play by the same consensus rules.
I just found the salty crowd that probably got in late. I'll bet you if every person that downvoted you suddenly received 1000 Bitcoin each, they'd all change their tune. That's how fickle and unprincipled they are. Haters gonna hate. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:57:59
Looking forward to atomic swaps.

Finally a decent meme

That'll be 125 bits for your coffee sir. Rolls off the tongue and sounds a lot better than: that'll be x mBTC sir.. mBTC is so clunky. Or even x Sats sounds clunky.
I reckon it's got to be Bits. It has a certain ring to it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:35:40
Trust me I'm a Bitcoin professional. xD
@_date: 2017-12-17 04:39:46
I gave my father the Uniform Resource Locator of our local exchange, explained some basics around wallets and security and left it at that. He managed to largely find his own way, and even one of his own friends helped him a little. At least now he's in charge and he understands Bitcoin a lot better. 
It's better this way. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 08:17:06
It's ridiculous to argue this when so many other services and competitors have been able to do so already. Coinbase has more resources than any of them. We need this *now*. It is their responsibility. They are negatively affecting the global Bitcoin network. It's time they got this done!
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:47:24
I don't like the construct of the way our respective governments work. They all operate on a similar model of violence and intimidation. I hope Bitcoin can collectively give us a voice to renegotiate some basic terms regarding citizens vs gov. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:22:58
I needed my glasses to see it lol ;)
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:28:34
I think they're being downvoted because the positives about Bitcoin are currently being heavily outweighed by the negatives (re: fees + congestion). I really think it's time to discuss a safe blocksize upgrade.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:41:00
It's all about the competition now. The current crop of incumbents are leaving a gaping wide hole for competitors to spring up around them.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:41:06
It's risky shorting Bitcoin now. But nevertheless, some people took that risk knowing what they were getting into. You win some you lose some. These guys and gals are probably playing with house money anyway. They're not shmuks dealing in a hundred dollars like you and me.
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:22:11
And why Segwit/LN allows the banks to provide Bitcoin custodianship and guarantor services if they so wish. We may as well use the infrastructure lying around ...
@_date: 2017-12-10 16:40:27
bwahaha so true... we got screwed royally by earlier generations.
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:21:17
I'm a long time r/Bitcoiner and I'm in favor of opening up a discussion on safely increasing the blocksize. I think the time is right.

If only the site was back online.. my body is ready!

That video demostration needs to be walked through on a mainstream platform. Once newcomers see that properly- they'll be more patient about the current fees and congestion.

The entire blockchain space is still in development.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:36:12
Absolutely not. Economists honestly have no clue what they are doing at the best of times. Depending on the economist, they make a lot of assumptions that end up ruining peoples lives on a mass scale.
Bitcoin is a real time natural experiment. layer 2 apps and forks are where anyone can go to experiment freely without disturbing the settlement layer.
You are free to make an exact copy of Bitcoin with your 1% inflation rate. If the market wants that, then the market will value such a coin highly. But if the market doesn't think much of it... we just move on. No animosity is required for people to experiment.
@_date: 2017-12-14 22:20:48
Except that it has a very simple rudimentary use. A secure, reliable, immutable, decentralized store of value. That's the maddening part to some, they cannot accept that we trust Bitcoin more than gold and more than our governments. In cryptography we trust. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 11:44:34
No, that's why the LN is in development. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 08:06:16
Now there's the real magic
@_date: 2017-12-11 19:41:35
Then you have failed to consider layer 2 as a pseudo-fiat equivalent to Bitcoin's "digital gold" settlement layer... I really don't think enough people have understood Bitcoin at all. And you know what- I don't blame them, it is very complex. That so-called "omg-savage-post-of-the-millenium-upvoted-by-the-millions" is the biggest joke I've ever seen. It reveals a lot to me about the way people think... and it's hilarious... seriously... why don't you sell all your Bitcoins and plough them into your favourite alt then.. put your money where your mouths are.
@_date: 2017-12-16 13:44:42
AFAIK in Japan Bitcoin is legal tender. So you cannot refuse it as payment.

@_date: 2017-12-13 08:03:13
You're speaking of microtransactions being priced out of the market. You're also not qualifying your negative sentiment with any word about the incoming Lightning Network which has been proven to work across 3 implementations already. Lightning transactions are instant and can be sent for a penny. 
How now brown cow? Relax. It's being fixed. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:38
I wonder if this is about allowing for charge-backs on the part of users. Perhaps Segwit and LN could allow for charge-backs to give us the consumers a leg up. 
Particularly in the event a business fails to deliver the goods or services paid for. Or a rival firm may offer a 60 day charge-back period as a featured guarantee of their work to get a leg up on their competitors.
Features like this can further incentivize Bitcoin as a payment network in addition to being gold 2.0, and hopefully consumers can get a better experience here in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:50:45
And Trezor has just built in duress codes as well. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:17:10
The ferryman only accepts BTC now. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 09:35:33
Which means if you buy Bitcoin over LN, you can easily settle them on-chain at any time. It's completely permissionless.
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:30:29
I think the Segwit era will eliminate a lot of hostility and even unnecessary competition against Bitcoin. To me it seems segwit allows the mainstream community permissionless involvement in Bitcoin's development.

@_date: 2017-12-20 06:10:00
Seems like you're over complicating a blocksize increase. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:17:40
There's no better store of value on the planet. Bitcoin is negatively correlated to geopolitical and sovereign risk. It provides instant protection from the fiat system. Despite being slow and expensive right now, it is extremely reliable, secure and censorship resistant. 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:17:28
It's a smashing success as digital gold already. All it has to do is continue to survive and continue rolling out its scaling upgrades.

Plot twist: Bitcoin is actually good for the environment. Why? Because the damage done to the environment by the fiat system and even gold mining is far far worse. 
Bitcoin is an upgrade for the environment. Not only that, Bitcoin could incentivize miners to fund R&amp;D into new energy sources like cold fusion for example.

It's going to be everywhere.

Awesome table. I think Luno ( deserves to be on this list since they are one of the more proactive exchanges. I don't know how big they are relative to other exchanges but from what I know they are present in Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Namibia, South Africa, Kenya and Nigeria.
They confirmed Batch txs is a "Yes", and send from Segwit is a "Vast majority of transactions". No Bech32 yet on Luno- so a confirmed "x" on that for now. I can PM you slack channel details to see the discussion with one of the Luno representatives if you wish to confirm further.

The rollout of segwit has been tepid at best. What gives? Let's safely bump the blocksize to bring relief since we'll need it anyway.

As Andreas explained, the CME crowd is a different school of fish compared to the thugs at Wallstreet. The CME traders are perhaps not so alien to a Bitcoiners ideological disposition. They could actually be great friends of Bitcoin.

I don't think you're following. I'm arguing there's no such thing as equality. It's a stupid childish notion that is not possible. We are not all genderless robots running the exact same program. We're all wired a bit differently with our own unique dreams and desires..  ergo we are all always going to go our own ways..  and therefore society can never be equal. Some are always going to be more resourceful and more ambitious with greater propensity for risk than others resulting in unequal outcomes.
So your beef with Bitcoin not solving your contrived issue of equality is completely moot. Your parents and your teachers failed to educate you in the most basic area of life, that we are not equal and never will be. If Bitcoin goes tits up, there will be no bailout. You decide if you want to take that risk or not. 
Having said all of that I believe Bitcoin will result in some fresh millionaires with a new culture and more libertarian ideology. I think that's a step up from where we are today.

I don't think monetizing nodes is necessarily a bad thing. A smaller node with lower bandwidth and lower costs can process X tx/s and receives an income. A larger node with higher bandwidth and higher costs can process X(n) tx/s and receives a magnified income. This wouldn't slow the network at all, a node that is too full can simply redirect new payment requests to the next available node. Kinda like a giant benevolent call center.

Allow me to flip the script if I may: Despite all the controversy, I view BCH as a sort of life support for Bitcoin. The competition between the two generates a lot of energy- and it brings the world's focus on that energy. BCH has brought much needed competitive pressure to what was an otherwise sluggish monopoly, and bought Bitcoin the time it needs to rollout Lightning. My 2 satoshis.

I wonder if it might help to change it from the wall of shame to something more positive like the "Segwit Wall of Fame" and rank them from most enabled to least enabled (alphabetical for any ties or whoever implemented first). We get the more proactive good guys to the top of the list! If done right, this could be a long lasting recordal of Bitcoin's history.

I actually think I agree. If LN fails to go into deployment by the end of December. Fuckit, we should do a blocksize increase to meet immediate demand. Surely we can reduce it later again..  
@_date: 2017-12-20 09:33:30
I'm not sure sticking with a 1mb blocksize is healthy for Bitcoin at this time. Bitcoin is taking on big reputational damage in anticipation of the lightning network.
We needed Lightning yesterday- now I'm firmly of the view it is time to safely upgrade the blocksize since we're going to need it anyway at some point down the line.

I've been wondering how this will look like in the real world. I imagine a retail store can open a lightning channel, conduct business for a year, then close it, finish up their accounting. And open a new channel for the new financial year. Would be nice to know how many times a business would need to open and close its lightning channels in any given timeframe.

Yes the definition I'm thinking of goes beyond code, and almost even has a spiritual component to it. For example when we designed political systems centred around democracy many centuries ago..  that to me was a human technology that took us to new heights. So technology is a hell of a lot more than mere code to some of us.

@_date: 2017-12-06 20:11:46
Priced-out transactions are not important enough to sacrifice security. This needs to be considered in terms of its legitimate trade-offs. With LN on the horizon the only possible need to sacrifice security and economy with bigger blocks is to compete with alts. Except that LN is the chosen vehicle to compete with alts. And many believe there is enough time to get LN up and running way ahead of the curve.
There are no royalties to use the LN. Development is permissionless.

Great interview! Good job explaining something like this to a non-technical audience. Look forward to future interviews! Keep going strong. It would be nice if you get a bigger time slot next time to actually demonstrate the lightning testnet.

I feel like we're talking past each other. I have no problem paying taxes. I understand why they're necessary, I've never skipped a tax payment in my life. I just want the whole lot to be simplified to the point where anyone can participate in the economy without having to hire an army of tax lawyers and accountants. I find the fundamental structure of the tax system stupid, as if it were built by children who think they own the playground. 
I want it all to be automated on our terms. I don't want to deal with the admin. Why can't they just build a simple sales tax into each trade and let the exchanges deal with the tax admin...surely that would lower barriers to the market and generate more tax revenue with less burden on users.

AFAIK your retailer can open a channel for an entire year, let 1000s of customers shop freely over their lightning channel for the year. Then only close it at year end for accounting purposes and to settle the txs on the chain, with a freshly opened channel for each new financial year.

I also think we should at least consider the nuclear option of a blocksize increase. The situation does not look good. We may have to sacrifice a little bit of decentralization to stabilize the situation until LN is ready. We're going to need a blocksize increase at some point anyway.

I think there needs to be a specially negotiated tax law for Bitcoin. We'll accept a maximum of 1% tax on any gains. At that point all is cleared to enjoy worry free. And we'll pay the ordinary sales taxes when we buy goods and services.
Yes I think that's a pretty good deal. They think they can simply write rules for us, without consulting us first? Look what happened to S2X and Btrash. We don't accept rules being made on our behalf. We're making the rules now.

These are valid points, but there is a sickness in the fiat financial sector that requires a cure. I still believe very strongly that we have found that cure. And it's far too late for alts (even iota as clever as it is) to usurp Bitcoin as crypto reserve. There are so many ships that have sailed nobody knows what will ultimately transpire. But I have very strong conviction in Bitcoin despite all the FUD. I've seen Bitcoin overcome everything thrown at it and it just gets stronger a la its anti-fragile properties. If volatility is a genuine concern, Bitcoin will evolve to address it. Bitcoin embodies engineered money. It's use as a currency is a secondary bonus achievable via lightning and in particular post price discovery phase. I'm still very bullish on Bitcoin and extremely weary of alts.

@_date: 2017-12-21 13:31:56
Deposited BTC at poloniex... they still had non-segwit deposit address- FML. This is the problem right here. For some reason the exchanges are not moving to implement segwit. I reckon it boils down to less money for them somehow. Either through dev costs to implement it, or somehow they'll get less fees.
So segwit is fantastic for users, but apparently business doesn't like it. You'd think there would be massive user demand for segwit... in fact we know every Bitcoiner wants it- yet they still drag their feet. It's just not making sense to me.

Competitive forces would drive miners to engage in energy efficient practices and even potentially energy R&amp;D. For all we know, Bitcoin miners could be the ones to unlock cold fusion as an energy source. Not only this, but blockchain technology in general can be used to completely decentralize the energy grid rendering government control of our energy supply obsolete. Bitcoin is biblical in its possibilities.. stay tuned.

I beg to differ on competition. The central bank cartel had no competition and look at the mess they created. Without a bit of competitive pressure al la LTC for example..  we might still be having a scaling debate while the old guard mobilised. At least speed of development can outpace regulations. While Bitcoin may not technically require any competition to function and grow, it certainly doesn't hurt.

Okay, timeout. I think you have lots of questions around anti-fragile systems. Bitcoin is only step 1 for building an anti-fragile world.
The broader cryptosphere will need to be designed to construct a broader more general anti-fragile world.
There is a long road ahead. Perhaps laws can be written into smart contracts that auto-execute. These are difficult issues the industry will have to address at some point.
@_date: 2017-08-23 12:20:35
All you're doing is proving the point about blockchains.
Unfortunately we need arbitrary human laws and arbitrary enforcement of those laws to keep our physical homes safe from home invasion.
However, if you're worried about government arbitrarily commandeering your home. There's a possible blockchain solution for that.

@_date: 2017-08-26 09:30:44
Exactly. It's mostly the case that once people have loads of money, they go after power and control next. And then once they have power, we know power corrupts. It's the same old song that's been sung since the very beginning of the dark ages..  and yet we haven't yet managed to properly quell those hidden darker incentives. They just silently repeat themselves over and over... we need to find ways of disincentivizing this easily predictable human behaviour

Zero custodial risk at your exchange. i.e. Private keys. I receive a tethered token to trade with each crypto but the actual coins remain in my custody at all times. So maybe a tethered exchange model?
Disgustingly easy to understand and intuitive trading GUI. 
Zero deposit and withdrawal fees. Zero. just normal network fees for sending and receiving. 
No withdrawal limits for white listed addresses. Users should be able to white list their own wallet addresses. 
2FA option for everything. Logging in, withdrawals etc...  
A trading fee of 0.01%

How does one quell or disincentivize such an elusive attack vector though? If they're really good it this, they could overwhelm grassroots discussion and opinion with their shilled position- which could successfully socially engineer the narrative in their favour.

@_date: 2017-08-18 04:52:16
Bitcoin is designed to be anti-fragile and very responsive to economic solutions through competing with its own chain splits out on the open market. Bitcoin likes this, and responds well to this. Political solutions like "let's all sing kumbaya, and let's all just get along" have no place at all in the crypto-economy. 
If you have a different vision about where it should go...  you split and let the market test your idea. If your idea sucks.. your alt coin will fail. If your idea is great, the market will follow it.
I see a future where politics are given a backseat to economics. For the most part, economic solutions allocate precious scarce resources far more efficiently than unnatural political interference in markets. Political overreach is on the chopping block... as is the central banking cartel.

Bitcoin is anti-fragile. It needs nothing from no-one. The protocol is designed with all necessary self-regulating incentive structures in place. Anything thrown at it which could slow it down or subvert can be addressed in a protocol upgrade, each one strengthening Bitcoin from the last.

I think that's where you're wrong and fail to understand that we can now technically program the market to make child slavery incredibly unprofitable. An economic solution to a political problem.
The question is... how? How can the market be programmed in such a way. The answer to which far exceeds my patience to explain it all here. In due course this conversation will bubble to the surface.

Those points can be argued out at a philosophical level. 
Demand for healthcare services is arguably infinite, while the resources within which to provide said services are finite. It is therefore not possible for it to be considered a basic human right. No matter how nice it would be. It is the cold truth of the matter. 
(Unless one day in the future our resources become infinite as well- then that would change the equation- but today that is a world of fiction, sadly not the one we live in yet).

Also BTC is a monetary system for the world. ETH is not a monetary system it's just tokens for smart contracts.. which aren't viral at all.

I'm hoping the devs come up with a way by consensus to punish miners for behaving against the interests of users. But at the same time leave enough incentive on the table for them to continue mining and securing the network. If we can strike that balance, Bitcoin will strengthen.

Thanks. Okay then can the protocol set a limit on how many per batch? Because if it can't then we can do billions of transaction on the LN network... and the miners get fees to settle 1 transaction that consisted of billions or even trillions of transactions? I'm lost. What happens to the miner incentives for keeping the bitcoin blockchain secure?

you can pay for that dumbass system. But I believe in voluntarism in genuinely helping others who genuinely need it. The people around you. this way creates a much better relationship between those in need and those who already have their comforts. your way results in my exact earlier reaction, a basic assumption they're gonna bum out. When you design social systems they must be built to induce the best in us, not incentivize bumming out.

Here.. this is what a "normie" sounds like. Someone who hasn't unplugged properly. Still thinks taxation enforced down the barrel of a gun is the right way to go.

Yes you can purchase any fraction of Bitcoin you like. Let's say you have $100 you'd like to throw into the ring. That's no problem. You'll receive about 0.02000000 BTC at current rates. This is the same as 2,000,000 bits. 
(About 2 million bits). Your bits will tend to always increase in value as time goes along. Happy investing :) Number  rule is to "hodl". It's just a running joke to hold. Don't sell or buy stuff until they're much more valuable.

Every time Bitcoin shakes off all the crap that's thrown at it, the underlying confidence in it as a store of value grows. That's why I think Bitcoin's price can, and probably will, go very high.

And what? Let miners decide when the network is clogged up enough and fee gouging has gone on long enough to up the blocksize? I don't think you realize how crap Bitcoin would become waiting for the next block increase to get the fees down at each surge in usage. In fact by then Bitcoin would have simply lost market share to Litecoin.

No. The left had their chance for the last 50 years since WW2. I'm unimpressed with the state of the world.. especially the West, which has become pussified and weak.

This sounds great but I'm still riding on faith that what you're saying will actually pan out that way. Despite knowing the promise of LN, my woke moment about it is still elusive for now..   one has to really do a deep dive and think through every eventuality of changing the Bitcoin protocol. The incentive structures and economics of Bitcoin are being modified. Until I read a lot more, I can only hope there are no unintended consequences.

If anything at all, Bitcoin is forcing the right conversation into the open. You'll suddenly see governments getting more efficient in delivering services in return for taxes as Bitcoin competes directly with them. And if they don't... Bitcoin and the broader crypto-economy will simply find ways around them. 
In my view they're already way too late. The only thing they can attempt to do now is co-op it somehow. Be ever vigilante of anyone or anything or any change to the protocol that can lead to your financial enslavement once again. Keep your eyes peeled. But ofc Bitcoin is built to be anti-fragile and censorship resistant, so I feel these risks are reasonably low for now.

It might. And I'm not saying that's a good thing. A small safety net is workable and within budget. Those people who fall through the cracks through no fault of their own should be given temporary government assistance. But the welfare programs are all pretty much out of control. 
@_date: 2017-08-02 05:37:46
Sure maybe it won't hit a $1 million by tomorrow- just as it may not hit $500k in 3 short years. That's like me saying the global economy won't hit a growth rate of 10% in 3 years because reasons. Of course it's unlikely to go that high  in that short time frame ... these things take time.

Well. Not all doctors agree they should be forced to endure your insane ideology. I know plenty of doctors who prefer the free market. The one market failure I can detect in the medical profession is when it comes to emergency care because of the demand inelasticity involved. Doctors have been known to demand outrageous extortionate payments from dying or birthing patients. 
(((Those))) are actual insurance events that can be funded via taxes. Anything beyond that is leftwing overreach. You're asking for unicorns and rainbows within a confined national budget. And you're basing the entire argument of universal healthcare on nothing more than childish emotions.

I'm not trying to be weird or troll. Bitcoin is mathematical law. You're referring to other civil laws already in place. But the decentralized and globally distributed p2p nature of Bitcoin in itself protects the protocol from a few people being beaten for running a node. This by itself disincentives the desire to engage in beating in the first because it is futile if the goal is to disrupt the network. Plus there are now satellite nodes as well preempting such barbaric thought processes.
But you do raise something else which is an area that the broader cryptosphere could potentially deal with in other ways.

Greed can be put to good use with the right incentive structures in place. But more importantly we must somehow figure out how to disincentivize power hungry people who want to start controlling whatever they can.

We need to remain vigilant and aware of these issues, and strive to stamp out incentives for malicious control.

ah yes, there is the base layer capacity limit which would increase scope for monopolized services on layer 2. But I'm hoping there'll be sufficient competition on layer 2 and 3 that it won't even matter.

In fact, the mere threat of upsizing the block should be made clear to all those who try funny business on layer 2 or 3.

Someone still has to pay, even in "universal healthcare". They're called tax payers. 
Just because you don't pay at point of sale, doesn't mean it was free. And doesn't mean someone else (mostly workers from the middle class) didn't have to pay for it. They did. 
Advocating for universal healthcare is the same as feigning morality. Healthcare cannot be considered a basic human right because you cannot demand services from a doctor without compensation.
The only conceivable area that I may agree with is to fund emergency care or catastrophic illness via taxes. Universal healthcare however is just leftwing overreach under feigned morality. 
*Edit: Not once at any point did I say let poor people die. It's an outrageous conclusion to jump to and get all apoplectic about. I never once actually said this. My core argument is about balancing healthcare provision within budget. ffs what is so bad and offensive about that?  I look forward to power being devolved back to the individual States (i.e. decentralized away from the centralized Federal government).

What about e.g. 1 sat 1 up/down vote in discussion forums. It could incentivize better quality discussion. Poster receives the net sum of upvote/downvotes, and voters pay to vote. In order to post you need to stake some coin because a very bad post (e.g. from trolls) could also lose money. A troll wouldn't stake coin in the first place.
It could limit discussion if the cost to participate was too high. However, if there is an equilibrium out there, the free market would would find it eventually. If the market doesn't respond, it's simply an idea that won't work. We move on and try something else.

the inevitable upgrade path for BCH is stuck in increasing blocksize which will continue to centralize the BCH mining sector until the BCH ecosystem collapses under its own weight. We won't be able to run full nodes either as they become far too expensive to run. 
Attacks against the BCH network will get easier and easier for special interests to co-opt it because of this. 
Hence, when you consider how BCH will play out its clear that it has 0% chance of succeeding in the medium to long term. Zero.

You're suggesting that up to $80bn dollars will suddenly jump around the markets? I think we're approaching the stage of deep liquidity which would make such a large drop highly unlikely. Maybe if it hits 10k it could go back to 5k (or maybe 4k max) but wouldn't expect to go much lower than that during a correction.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:04
Yes I feel from here on out, any downward turn or trend won't be seen as a "death spiral" any longer. The Bcash failure to artificially dethrone Bitcoin a few weeks ago actually strengthened the overall psychology around Bitcoin. People genuinely believe in the promise of Bitcoin- they're even beginning to have real faith in it. The best part is it has been earned on full display for the whole world to see. Even so, there's still a lot more respect to be earned going forward.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:52:03
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:00:04
Bcash has a dead end upgrade path that runs counter to Satoshi's vision of a decentralized value transfer network. Unfortunately people have to look beyond the face value of Bcash to understand this.

Bitcoin has survived everything that has been thrown at it for just about a decade now. Bitcoin has pedigree, it has a proven reputation of security, and it is the premier store of wealth. Not to mention it is crypto reserve, is the most widely used and recognised globally, has a very solid road map ahead to become much cheaper and faster, more private, and flexible enough for Bitcoin powered smart contracts. It also has the biggest user and developer community by far. 
All these other competing cryptos don't stand a chance once Bitcoin undergoes a few more protocol upgrades which will be happening sooner than we think. Pay no mind to temporarily expensive transactions, they're being fully addressed in the lightning network upgrade. 
And I haven't even mentioned the secret sauce... Vires in Numeris!

@_date: 2017-11-12 15:58:08
I was paying about $5 or so per transaction a few days ago. Those went through within just a few minutes. But it seems the network is backlogged a bit more now. So depending on the fee it can take several hours or maybe a day or two.
Try use a transaction boosting service? I haven't used these before but I've heard about them

@_date: 2017-11-14 08:13:06
It's all about risk / reward. The people that make stuff take a certain level of risk and enjoy their commensurate reward which is a stabler more reliable income, better piece of mind with a decent return. But people who play on the stock markets take on risk orders of magnitude greater, and thus enjoy a higher return, but it's often not very stable and these people do not have the same piece of mind. 
Given these trade-offs I think it's a bit asinine to assume traders "are living the life" compared to people who actually create and build things living a stabler life.
This post refers to honest traders. Not the genuinely fraudulent kind who can rot in a cage for all I care.

yeah... bullsh... cough...  
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:40:29
Happy I left them months ago. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:38:04
hear ye hear ye... Bitfinex, how do ye respond to these allegations? 
@_date: 2017-11-05 14:36:24
anyone know where this is from? so funny 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:59:34
Yeah stick to Bitcoin, most alts are very shaky and finding a hidden gem in the alt scene is not as easy as some might think. Most people including myself have third degree burns from dabbling in the alt market. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 13:19:29
It's not official, but it seems de facto. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:41:22
Good, let's get Bitcoin's infrastructure up and running before worrying about altcoins 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:26:46
Well they tried... BCH has popped.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:51:15
We should make it 1 Bit = 1 Satoshi. And price goods and services in bits from now on. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:45:23
Yeah, it's exhausting countering all the FUD during FUD season.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:38:31
What if someone like Slush sets up a pro bono mining service? Could something like that even make a dent? 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:49:45
lol what flowery language 
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:54:59
Yeah don't worry about, it will arrive. There's no rushing a real revolution. Just buy and hold. Bitcoin has barely begun.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:33:10
The moon is just a pit stop in a far grander journey 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:52
Yeah finally. Let's get to the bottom of this and put it in the ground before it festers... 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:58:24
Agree 
@_date: 2017-11-07 10:54:59
There's an old saying that suggests we shouldn't stop and throw stones at every dog that barks... because it'll get us nowhere. S2X or B2X does not have replay protection and is highly controversial so treating it with any degree of legitimacy is akin to throwing stones at a barking dog. Every single actor in the ecosystem should simply ignore it entirely. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:09:43
if segwit doesn't propagate now in the early days, it'll be much harder later on. Luckily we have wallet providers which are making navigation easier for users. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:18:26
Know any good trusted devs we can talk to? 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:53:58
for all our sakes I hope this is all just FUD 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:32:15
Yeah but it seems there's a lot of fools who think bcash is legit long term. It ain't, and they're gonna get burnt.
Let's not forget, we have satellites in space and the lions share of devs. Super bullish on Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:37:32
Yes but now they're fighting major headwinds and it's costing them.... big time. Doubt has been introduced into the minds of BCH holders... this attempted coupe is over.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:17:50
Not holding my breath at all, Bcash is a counterfeit coin with nothing but a monopolized and centralized future. It will 100% fail.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:27:12
Sure.. it was highly successful.. for about 5 people... 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:23:41
People can simply use Bitwage AFAIK. You redirect your salary to a designated Bitwage account number. They then send you whatever % you want in Bitcoin and fiat 
@_date: 2017-11-03 11:54:35
Bitcoin's market cap is above 100bn. What don't i understand? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 11:20:37
lol true, it doesn't. But shillsters have clearly managed to convince some poor souls 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:20:08
No.. this is the market stating clearly and decisively that Bcash has no future at all.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:05:40
ugh... that long?.. I thought devs were further along.. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:43:13
Agree, if something happens to Coinbase Bitcoin will take a major knock even though it will be the fault of Coinbase 
@_date: 2017-11-10 06:26:31
Feels so good knowing just how resilient Bitcoin can be, all the lessons we've learnt, and knowing that Bitcoin will continuously improve until it is as close to perfect as we can get it to be.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:19:09
I have since revised it back up to 100%.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:04:16
They'll take the can't beat em join em approach. They'll integrate lightning and offer custodianship services.
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:51:54
what the? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:45:00
ah.. Bitcoin's 'Final Form' is going to be splendid
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:59:28
Yeah by then the BTC market cap would be +$1tn
@_date: 2017-11-13 10:58:08
It's annoying but necessary to immunize Bitcoin as much as possible during these early days.
@_date: 2017-11-22 17:04:55
Looks awesome thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:26:59
Don't get me wrong I love the work Andreas does. But Satoshi Nakamoto deserves the Nobel peace prize. In fact the Nobel peace prize is beneath Satoshi's achievement.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:30:23
Bitcoin has multiple satellites in space holding copies of the ledger as well. And probably more satellites being added.. this shit is here to stay.
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:10:25
Bullshit. The public is involved now. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 13:28:38
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:30:34
Maybe because they're hodling and haven't triggered any taxable event at this time. IRS needs to put its dick back in its pants.
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:15:52
But surely the atomic swap market would generate it's own exchange rate?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:29:21
Nah... boomers raised snowflakes. Millennials are terrible but boomers are at fault 
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:17:54
And we all know which people are moving that money around... 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:37:08
I hate the politics as well. But all the politics is a sign of where the real party is at. And it's right here in Bitcoin. No other alt has this level of politics.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:37:47
Okay that was funny
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:53:07
Digging the Segwit address.
@_date: 2017-11-25 19:42:40
This goes way beyond a new political system. This goes to a whole new way of life..
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:10:17
Yeah same.. when I looked at the price this morning I kept my eyes closed. When I opened them I was VERY happy to see Bitcoin's strength and resilience shining brightly.
@_date: 2017-11-10 19:34:34
Looks awesome, good luck! 
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:25:21
And thank God for that...  but the other half of the boomers fucked up really bad with their kids raising snowflakes that we have to deal with now..  
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:01:12
You can't say "no fix". Segwit allows anyone in the world to build apps on top of the rock solid, secure, decentralized base layer. Hodl... an explosion of development is on the way.
@_date: 2017-11-11 19:56:57
Of course it is! It makes it all astroturf. BCH is an astroturf coin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:28:56
Exodus wallet. Very user friendly.
@_date: 2017-11-15 11:18:02
Can't we just get 2FA for reddit? wouldn't that solve a lot of problems? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:30:14
Ver sounds just like every other liberal out there...  whiny and ungrateful.. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:10:12
There's a lot of infrastructure we're gonna need. Why not subsume what's already there. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 10:03:19
Good stuff! Their actions speak louder than the FUD surrounding them. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:19:23
if we must fight for uniform homogeneous marxist-like equality.. we must strive to ensure everyone's shit stinks the same too.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:33:13
exactly and for example receivers of coin like car dealerships or home sellers could require the transaction settle before releasing the goods. A grocery chain could operate on LN and settle once per day / week / month. Totally up to them. It's just beautiful 
@_date: 2017-11-18 18:38:32
Unfortunately there's no shortage of the gullible. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:15:49
I agree, let's start by abolishing all affirmative action measures. Since that's the definition of treating people differently.
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:42:33
Man I really want to agree with this- but it's starting to feel a bit pyramid-schemy. 
We cannot simply tell newcomers to HODL. True Hodlers understand why they are hodling. If this subtle disconnect grows too large- that's what creates a bubble.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:02:20
BTC is always front and center, it is the reserve crypto. There is never a secondary role for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2019-12-16 04:41:38
If you think your country is fucked up as hell, you don't know what fucked up is.
@_date: 2019-12-06 13:28:56
How many obituaries are we at now?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:26:04
well i certainly hope my node is not going to waste
@_date: 2017-11-09 11:40:34
I won't be using shapeshit anymore. high fees and hostile to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:40:06
Volatility should technically decrease with deeper liquidity and futures in play. But who knows until it actually happens.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:23:20
so you have no tx ID?
@_date: 2017-11-13 17:06:16
Funny, I came here thinking I'd find a nice summary of Bitcoin facts and figures they could use. But that's the advanced blogger pack I'm sure ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:22:21
Fuck yeah Charlie!!
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:27:40
Merry Christmas 
@_date: 2017-11-08 21:15:39
Haha amazing news!! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 15:01:47
They've been court martialed in Kekistan. Their credibility is in the toilet.
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:50:05
Been harassing our local payment channel to implement Segwit... hoping they implement soon.
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:59:58
lol ... tough crowd
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:08:14
The economic majority sits with r/Bitcoin by far. Hence the $6k price tag. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 17:14:12
Secure some small profits before the next phase begins. Don't be too greedy.
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:13:56
when you say layer 2 network protocol, does that mean that it's open? Or is it proprietary?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:27:19
the only thing that trumps the US Constitution is the 10 Commandments which aren't formalized- they're implied.
@_date: 2017-11-14 18:57:22
So I'm guessing there is such thing as arbitrage between the Bitcoin futures market and the actual Bitcoin market?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:37:19
It's just intuition from what I've witnessed over the years. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:56:31
The log chart healthy 
@_date: 2017-11-03 05:58:02
Payment channels are currently proliferating at a high speed. They'll be implementing LN soon I think 
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:19:26
can i set my 1070 to help clear low and zero fee transactions. I'd like to help out in my own small way.  I would even temporarily run it for free without collecting transaction fees. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:37:46
Exactly. I wouldn't trust them. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:37:20
You can't even say "holiday" because it is derived from "Holy Day" and may offend something. You can't even keep up with your own pecking order. no thanks. That entire way of thinking I've completely scrapped. It's all bs and i can't believe I nearly got sucked into it.
MERRY CHRISTMAS.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:32:09
Serious discipline needed. 
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:39:24
Tether is being printed. It should be banned. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:39:36
The attempted coupe is over... BCH falling like a rock. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 12:46:28
Every fork is a dividend my friend. It's a different world- cannot apply old rules here.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:24:41
Me too, and once lightning is ready, you'll get what you're looking for. Even day to day banks will be able to incorporate the lightning network. Bitcoin could even potentially transform the banks this way. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:14:04
this includes Trezor. They should set policy not to deal with contentious forks that lack replay protection. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 14:20:44
Can't they run a beta on the side like Trezor and then prepare to mainstream Segwit... there's so many ways for them to handle this quickly and efficiently.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:28:54
Nice response. I hope Bitcoin can stay cyperpunk.
@_date: 2017-11-08 09:22:21
The FUD around S2X is intense. I suspect the honey badger will shrug it off.. but I worry.
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:56:25
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:33:10
oh geez I'm getting tired of these... 
@_date: 2017-11-17 05:26:21
You just have to learn to contain yourself. When people ask me about Bitcoin these days. I give them very flat docile answers and conversation about it. I try not to be all hypey because they then become hostile or edgy. It's a weird thing. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 08:01:08
That's because the debate is over. Your side lost. And it is glorious. We're in the mocking phase now..
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:39:36
Very cool 
@_date: 2017-11-14 07:26:36
I'd love a little hardware plug n play full node that can update it's firmware and software and has at least 1 drive bay. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:39:47
I'd like to know what's up with this USDT counterfeiting story. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:43:20
The Trezor team is legendary when it comes to navigating these forks. You can rest assured they're on it.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:16:18
It is time they come to the table, or it is time they fuck off. Their fees should adjust automatically with a tighter more reflective and responsive algorithm. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 14:28:01
Gen x is probably even more to blame for this mess. But the boomers didn't pass on their lessons to gen x well enough. So they're both to blame. Sad outcome. Now we have to clean up this fucking mess.
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:44:28
BCH just tanked hard...  Bitcoin is fighting back!
@_date: 2017-11-11 11:40:53
fair enough 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:17:38
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:47:18
Challange? Bah... those copy cats stand zero chance of becoming  They couldn't handle heat... 
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:15:43
seems like a natural name for the forked altcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-07 05:08:50
I kinda agree, they should label it BTC and B2X so that it is clear who is forking. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:54:20
Does anyone know if you can withdraw Bitcoin from Bittrex directly to a Segwit address starting in '3' ?
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:32:02
I kinda like some of the twitter stuff mainly because it's sort of like listening to the conversation going on out there. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:58:21
Which is why I'm concerned that the CME futures deal could blindside us if they side with B2X...  
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:55:42
 lolling hard  xD
@_date: 2017-11-09 16:38:15
I've been harassing our local payment channel to upgrade to Segwit. Let's see what happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:31:26
big boss fights ahead 
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:53:06
Hahaha so true. When it came to my mother, I agreed to be the custodian on her behalf as well :) 
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:54:03
it's funny cause Dash and Monero are showing similar patterns at Korean exchanges...  it's almost like someone or a small group of wealthy players are artificially pushing all the payment coins...  it's definitely far from organic...  
@_date: 2017-11-01 06:12:05
Miners need to stfu, when the value of our network increases, the Bitcoin they mine is worth more. They have no right to complain at all. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:32:36
I'll be buying cheap coin on the way down if this happens.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:28:49
but let's say i ignore profitability. could i clear even 5 low fee/zero fee txs per day? 
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:37:24
if it is a problem the only way to stop this is to learn the truth asap
@_date: 2017-11-23 13:53:52
I see no real reason for BCH to explode. Cheap fast payments simply mean nothing to me. The lightning network is just a bonus  
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:21:55
I thought it was illegal to deface national currencies since they're owned by the Government. 
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:44:44
Sadly you're right, I guess I'm just an idealist, well at least in my own mind. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 15:13:58
What I'd like is a plug n play full node. A little box like a roku. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 08:28:55
I began doing Segwit transactions as of yesterday. There's a very strong economic incentive to move over and use Segwit.
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:37:07
I wouldn't be surprised. A very rapid rise to +50k or so, then a like 60-70% drop from there back to around 15 - 20k... then hopefully stable growth from there- some shit like that 
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:19:23
agree Bitcoin must sort this out asap 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:24:53
it's all short term gimmickery... there's no future for it.
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:55:46
It's all about the veteran hodlers who are now beginning to spend in the real economy 
@_date: 2017-11-09 18:49:38
Not to mention they've based Prism on Ethereum as reserve. However he can redeem himself if he switches Prism over to e. g.  Rootstock and rebases Prism with Bitcoin as crypto reserve. That would go a long way for me. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:00:28
ALmost had me there... hahaha
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:07:40
Super Saiyan starts at $20k! 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:41:26
To me even BTG &gt; BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-17 14:36:25
It's to keep us distracted... maybe there's trouble brewing and we're not aware... 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:43:07
Probably increase in the short-run but medium term onwards will be better than it is now.
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:22:15
I've just learnt something :) This fact needs to be drummed up a bit now 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:39:26
lol i just posted link as well- nice discussion taking place.
@_date: 2017-11-19 03:28:01
Plot twist, buys the club instead. Drinks are on the house. 
@_date: 2017-11-14 19:17:03
It's mainly been the last week like you say. I'm looking forward to the next calm period.
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:33:28
@_date: 2017-11-04 18:19:42
there might be WW4 before that happens...  but yeah..  oil priced in Bitcoin would seal the deal pretty much permanently 
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:53:28
it's the worst when your coins are outside of your control 
@_date: 2017-11-11 20:42:50
Can Bitcoin Cash transactions ever be instant using this technique? I would think not.
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:09:11
man if someone is counterfeiting USDT to buy Bitcoin.. they need to be arrested. And USDT needs to be removed from all exchanges..  all crypto could suffer for this.. 
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:00:17
There's also r/BitcoinSerious you can check it
@_date: 2017-11-11 06:40:45
What's funny is how anyone thinks BCH has a chance above 0% of succeeding. That's what's funny.
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:26:45
and rightfully so. Boomers raised snowflakes enmasse.. just look at this cesspit 
@_date: 2017-11-23 15:22:58
I have a plethora of far stronger reasons...  but to decode them for you is something I don't have time for. You're desperate to understand the magic of Bitcoin and that is understandable. There's not much time left to make your move ... only a few days left tops. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:47:02
Exactly this. Option 1 is my personal favorite and I still believe very strongly that it will happen. I just know there's a lot of people out there that want to see Bitcoin crash and burn.. but thanks to its censorship-resistant(/proof?) and anti-fragile properties, I'm more confident than ever there's nothing anyone can really do to stop this. And because Segwit allows the more mainstream world to also build apps on top... I think they're now on-boarding rather than fighting it. Bitcoin's intrinsic value is being proven in real-time. I think we're going to 100k in next 24-36 months ez.
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:39:10
Savvy hodlers would rotate some gains into gold and cash along the way. Makes sailing through the storms a lot easier.
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:32:40
I don't see the Bitcoin logo on your website at the bottom or anywhere. I see Visa, Mastercard, AMEX and Paypal though.. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:22:40
LN is layer 2. Any potential centralization on layer 2 is meaningless since layer 1 is faithfully kept decentralized.
@_date: 2019-12-15 13:34:21
So there's no bull market unless it's breaking completely new ground? gtfo..
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:59:04
I'd prefer 1 bit = 1 sat and we price things in bits. 
@_date: 2017-11-11 12:49:26
this s2x really played into the hands of Bitcoin's competitors. But now it's all hands on deck. The stakes are so high I can't imagine development not moving along now at a breakneck pace. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:59:54
100% this will happen.
@_date: 2017-11-24 17:26:54
Indeed, priority  is a secure premier censorship-free store of value. Everything else is a bonus. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:32:34
Hodling Bgold in preparation of such an attack.

Excuse me, but I see the same as Alan2420. The BCH crowd are nothing but late-comers drumming up a cheap imitation and looking to score using cheap tricks. We could implement a block size increase in 5mins pips... but we don't and for good reason. The only thing BCash is good for is the controversy and the concomitant Bitcoin coverage that goes with it. Overwhelmingly the media focus is on this Bitcoin war... no other coins. So BTC is benefiting from this with the added bonus that Bcash's failure to overthrow  has egg all over their faces right in front of the whole world. It just makes BTC look stronger and stronger. Our anti-fragile properties are working beautifully.
Of course I dumped my BCH. It's worthless.

I think defacing national currency considered a crime in some countries. We don't need to resort to sabotage. Bitcoin will win on its own merits.

It makes USDT a counterfeit problem. USDT is not a true cryptocurrency so it's absolutely no surprise that something fishy would take place with it. The solution is to demand exchanges keep real USD and not USDT. I dunno..

Smart contracts are also coming to Bitcoin. You'll be able to setup a list of beneficiaries family/friends etc to receive their respective allocations based on a Bitcoin smart contract.

I strongly disagree. If we did not take an "us versus them" attitude. We'd have S2X by now... it's important to be combative. In fact I would argue that the real war is only beginning, but the real war can only be fought on a unified front. So here we are.... it's all about what we do next...

I've made similar indications to Trezor. They should have a firm policy to not entertain any contentious fork that fails to implement replay protection. In fact the whole industry should simply set policy to that effect. 
It's the same as setting a policy of never negotiating with terrorists. And being consistent in enforcing that policy.

Exactly, at the end of the day it's a mutual deal brokered and managed by the bank. If they're not unscrupulous and there's a fair deal all round- then I don't see the problem. A borrower pays interest and a saver earns interest minus the bank's cut. As long as its reasonable, everyone gets what they want.
I'm happy for Bitcoin to simply become an anchor point like gold was during the gold standard. That alone would cure many problems.

How does your argument stack up when Ethereum becomes volatile as well? It falls apart.. 
The thing that makes a coin a good store of value is a combo of censorship resistance, immutability, reliability, fugibility, and gold mindshare. Bitcoin has all of these things but Ethereum has already suffered loss of immutability and does not have gold mindshare. 
The Eth platform is not that reliable either.. all ERC-20 tokens built on top of Ethereum go down when Ethereum is jammed up.

 directly taxing Bitcoin is stupid. They get their tax through ordinary sale of goods and services.

The value of your citizenship depends strongly on the strength of your border and how well the will of the people is actually reflected in policies.
We know weak borders and dictators (re minimized personal freedom) devalue your citizenship so I'm not sure why this is even a topic of contention. It's a settled matter and we need to move on from it.
Citizens of the US have a lot more personal freedom than citizens of North Korea. Kim fits the proper definition of a dictator. Trump I guess I would define as a populist-conservative loved by some hated by others.

Small government and fiscal responsibility is a part of conservatism. But it's a lot more than just that... 
For me the main thing is sovereignty and citizenship. Secure borders are an expression of sovereignty. Conservatives seek to maximize the value of citizenship and sometimes you need a wall to do that.
The no borders bleeding heart liberals do not value these things at all. They're morally and gender confused people that need help.

Individual freedom vs government power is a rational area to discuss. But open borders is a radical notion the vast majority in any nation would not take seriously. If borders dissolved it would have to be on the back of a completely new world order. Some kind of advanced civilizational order... but it's highly theoretical as to the effects.
Things like language and culture are nurtured and guarded from within secure borders. People that don't respect those things advocate for open borders.

After changing my mind over and over, as of now I'm in the Segwit2x camp. But that depends on whether segwit2x means higher fees per transaction or merely more fees collected per block. (edit: switched again back to Segwit UASF- it doesn't make sense to risk a chain split. We can do 2mb blocks in another upgrade later if its absolutely necessary.)

The altcoins play their role here from a game theoric point of view. What's the point in attacking Bitcoin if we'll all just shift into Dash, LTC, Monero, PIVX, IOTA? If they find a way to block one, we'll just use another and they would have wasted their time and money. So I think in the beginning when it was literally just Bitcoin maybe they had a chance. But not now with so many alternative protocols available. 
Plus you have to assume all major countries were able to perfectly coordinate against cryptos. It just takes one biggish country to be friendly towards Bitcoin for their plan to fail. Because all the investment would flow to the Bitcoin friendly country and away from the attackers.
Lastly Bitcoin has a way of uncorrupting the corrupted. Once government officials begin getting their hands on Bitcoin, even they would start to manoeuvre to protect and nurture it. Human incentives appear to change once you're holding a decent stack of it you want to see it go up. i.e. It's really easy to get government officials in our pocket.

@_date: 2017-07-10 10:06:33
technically true- but economically false. For me spam = transactions that are not rooted in real economic activity. But anyway, AFAIK, after Segwit the Schnorr upgrade would make it more expensive to spam while maintaining low fees for real users.

the only way is to chip away at their power by replacing governmental functions with smart contracts and decentralized governance. Now we go forth and write code to minimize government interference in our lives :)
@_date: 2017-07-22 09:49:14
This is a major problem for Bitcoin. We cannot simply freeze all Bitcoin transactions around every upgrade. Will Segwit allow us to upgrade more seamlessly in the future? I find this to be extremely disturbing and damaging to the entire idea of Bitcoin.

Surprizingly Jeff Burwick doesn't believe we ever really went to the moon. It's kind of made me at least question it. My default position is that yes we did go. But. Do we have verifiable proof that we went to the moon- or did it just look like we went to the moon?

Goldman Sachs is attempting to monopolize price discovery. It's an amazing slight of hand... here we're busy thinking the market determines the price from a state of perfect competition. But in reality- there may be a single controller of the price already.. someone or something might already posses a monopoly on the most important aspect of Bitcoin- it's natural price discovery mechanism.
@_date: 2017-07-12 08:10:24

There are competitive pressures to fend off from LTC, DASH, PIVX. And symbolically- although not a true competitor, Ethereum needed the kick in the teeth from its floppening. Bitcoin not only has to remain technologically at pace with alt coins, but it needs to shine in the spotlight as well- all the way through this unfolding story. We cannot have peasant alt coins detracting Bitcoin's spotlight
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:31:54
it kinda reminds me of the gold standard, where rectangular pieces of paper were backed by actual gold. So it seems to me like they're trying to offer the same thing all over again. It's what these people know from back in the 50s/60s ... except this time, Bitcoin cannot easily be removed from the monetary system.. and the value cannot  easily be manipulated. It would become overly expensive at some point to whale the value

We have to think of all attack vectors on Bitcoin. Including special interests. This is how the founding fathers of the U.S thought through their constitution when designing it. We must do the same and find more ways to make these protocols ever more resilient to governmental/special interest influence. We cannot allow a swamp to build up in this ecosystem.

I've lamented on this problem that Bitcoin has around upgrade time. We all have to basically stop transacting until the dust settles lest our coins might vanish. I was shot down at the time for raising this as problematic for Bitcoin. But here we are...  
@_date: 2017-07-12 07:15:50
.. or has it.. ? :) there are ways .. 
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:07:10
so are you saying that Trezor will do the coin splitting for us?
@_date: 2017-07-24 16:57:58
People who try to do this and get burned, deserve it.
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:09:19
yes but the point is exchanges and merchants are freezing transactions around upgrade time to protect funds. but this is unworkable if we want mass adoption. I would classify this as a major problem that has to be resolved. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 09:44:08
Sorry man :/ i guess if you had your seeds and private keys taken against your will... there's nothing we can do. The only real way to protect ourselves is committing our seeds to memory and destroying all physical record keeping. but then they can always torture for info... so we're still a way off from removing all counterparty risk.

Surely they can implement a transparent nominal service fee when transactions move in and out. This would at least help them pay some of their bills but not deter customer usage. A quality wallet will be justified in charging a small service fee. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 14:22:13
i hope so. because this is the bullshit that's going on around these fucking upgrades. it's not ideal at fucking all.  
@_date: 2017-07-19 16:14:38
The problem with smart-contracts is that you can still get screwed by the parties who setup the smart contracts. A little social engineering to lure someone in.. then BAM.. swindled out of their home. There's a lot of problems with smart-contracts. Bitcoin on the other hand is a very simple notion that most people can get behind.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:10:39
i can understand LTC. It is after all a proven reliable blockchain with similar function to BTC. However, ETH as a safe haven / backup?.. now that's just plain ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-07-24 06:13:38
In a way I agree with that. I do think that we're in the process of perfecting and polishing Bitcoin, so there'll be some turbulence,  but once most upgrades are done it should become more and more stable as liquidity deepens, protocol upgrades taper off (because they're all done). Bitcoin is just going to get stronger and stronger. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 12:47:15
Yeah i came across this tax issue as well. but like you said it will be difficult to prove anything for most small to medium purchases. however buying things like houses and maybe cars could attract the tax man. but again fuck them, theyre getting sales taxes and transfer duties already. they can still get fucked as far as I'm concerned.
The entire tax code should be a single sentence which reads as follows: 
"A taxation of 10% may be levied on the sale of goods and services, no other taxation is permitted."
There, that should be put in the constitution..  and the entire tax code scrapped. That should line up with the small size of government once we're through with them. 
@_date: 2017-07-06 13:04:00
YOLO. It's going to be far more painful to watch Bitcoin run away from you, than taking a once in a lifetime chance on something while you still have time.. but the window is closing fast I think. As always the choice is yours... if you weren't really going to do much with your pocket money anyway.. hell.. watayagotolose? There's no time for caution. Get familiar with this topic fast and make your choice. Just whatever you do.. use a reputable exchange.. don't meet people selling coins.. and once you have your coins, move them to a wallet where you own the private keys.
@_date: 2018-04-14 17:14:50
I'm genuinely curious. What kind of model does anybody hope to achieve in a no borders world. It sounds great on paper, or in songs like John Lennon's Imagine... but how would that work in practice? Is there a rational argument for no borders? Because I struggle to see it at this time. What? We all become undocumented agnostic mammalian resource seekers randomly roaming free? Forgive us for being opposed to such an order.

@_date: 2017-07-30 08:07:09
Of course the normie would chime in. You lot are worse then they are. Don't get in between this thinking you know what's best either. Here's about the best definition of cultural Marxism  It's a cabal of politically correct social justice warriors and feminists who basically self-appoint themselves as arbiters of morality. They're moral relativists making up morality as they go along depending on who's in charge and the dominant culture of the time. They lost the argument. And they need to get over it.

Remember. The price volatility of Bitcoin is not a reflection of Bitcoin's volatility..  it's a reflection of global volatility. I've studied the geopolitical macroeconomic events that influence Bitcoin. Every time there is instability in world events like Brexit or Cyprus capital controls..  Bitcoin is there reflecting that volatility. When Bitcoin finally stabilizes and I mean truly stabilize..  You'll notice the world in general being a lot more stable too. 
Bitcoin is kinda like a barometer of global geopolitical stability.

Prism will have endless competition in no time. Within 6 months there may literally be 100s of services similar to Prism and Shapeshift. This will drive the prices waay down and the service quality waay up. I'm pretty hopefully for the future... this is raw global competition.

The roadmap for Bitcoin's protocol upgrades look promising. Hard forking doesn't phase me in the slightest. The version of Bitcoin that remains closest to good properties of money and sovereignty will always win in this game of decentralization. It's the name of this game and most actual users take that aspect very seriously. Traders on the other hand probably only care where users go. Bitcoin Core's vision of BIP148 / UASF will win if two versions of Bitcoin have to duke it out in the market place. Either way I look forward to the whole showdown.

This is an outrage! totally irresponsible... 
@_date: 2017-07-22 12:36:47
I think you're missing the point, it doesn't matter that you or I know what to do during upgrade time. but ffs when ordinary users get fucked? Bitcoin would be far more useful if upgrades could occur with no disruption to the service. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:29:52
Then we shall moon in the shade.. 
@_date: 2017-07-23 12:10:29
Thanks- I'm very curious about future upgrades and how far we can take this tech. 
Question though: Can Bitcoin compete with IOTA which seems to allow for instant, free transactions with no miners to speak of ... 
@_date: 2017-07-06 18:44:35
Well since you're here now, why don't you educate us and other readers on why 1mb is a technical limitation for deploying a lightning network. Make me understand because I'd genuinely like to know. Or at least direct us to some source material which makes that argument so we can evaluate it. Either way if 2mb is necessary for LN, it will be considered at the next protocol upgrade. It's not like 1 August will be the last time we upgrade the protocol. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 17:48:28
but surely making it legal tender was a biggie no?
@_date: 2017-07-22 11:43:01
i don't give a fuck what my question sounds like. this is a problem that has to be addressed 
@_date: 2017-07-02 21:55:06
That's correct, people don't transact for the sake of transacting. 
@_date: 2017-07-02 15:10:29

@_date: 2017-07-13 20:02:03
It's impossible, if someone starts buying it up, the price will surely? increase dramatically up the curve
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:43:24
Possible reasons:
1) Traders are taking a break;  
2) Real world users suddenly not transacting (this doesn't seem likely though);    
3) Someone who really wanted the network to die/mutate or "prove" Bitcoin needed change finally ran out of money. Or potentially because they now have what they want in Segwit2x- they've achieved their goal and no longer incentivized to continue creating a potentially artificial problem. If this is true- then Bitcoin needs a better mechanism to deal with network spam; or  
4) We're simply in the eye of the storm before Segwit. And a big volatile storm is probably coming.  
All in all, best strat is as always- to simply hodl and ride it all out. Get some LTC and ETC to attenuate your portfolio in the coming month. Bitcoin is designed to be resilient. All it has to do is continue to survive each obstacle thrown at it.
Ethereum's corresponding uptick in transaction activity is probably just ICO related. I doubt that is rooted in any appreciable real world use. So no. ETH is not even close to a crypto-flippening. Calm the fuck down- ETH has its place, but its not on the top of the hill. However, Bitcoin is hopefully continuing its preparation for the real flippening that matters... i.e. between the cypto and fiat world.
@_date: 2017-07-18 08:56:18
It's extremely relevant to Bitcoin. It's on the cards as one of Bitcoin's protocol upgrades

@_date: 2017-07-25 05:52:22
Of course it would. I've studied macroeconomic events surrounding Bitcoin. Large events coincide with huge increases in the price of Bitcoin. E. g. Brexit or Cyprus capital controls saw large uptick in Bitcoin's price. 
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:59:23
ok ok I'm back in the Segwit UASF camp :) 
@_date: 2017-07-04 08:07:40
it just takes 1 country to exempt miners from all tax. Watch mining houses migrate... then their host countries will be forced to drop tax as well. Governments are going to be relegated to charging a sales tax only. And then even that function we'll take from them and decentralize it somehow.
We only have to solve the problem of who will build the roads using the blockchain instead of government... and we'll be free
@_date: 2017-07-06 07:22:05

that's if you believe you need ETH to do all of the smart contracting. ETH will face mega competition. I think Bitcoin still has the special status of crypto reserve.
@_date: 2017-07-07 05:52:51
For this reason a clean Segwit upgrade for now makes more sense than Segwit2x. We can do 2mb blocks later if its absolutely necessary in a separate upgrade.

I've thought about this a fair bit, maybe not as much as you. For me anyway Bitcoin's supreme function is a decentralized, secure, honest, censorship resistant store of value. That's the  reason I invested in Bitcoin. 
However, I don't see how adding quicker cheaper transactions jeopardises it's core function. It's still going to be secure and decentralized. We can even go for a User Activated Miner Decentralization soft/hard fork (UAMD) if we must. There are no rules, we are all in control of how we want the system to work.

@_date: 2018-12-21 19:46:37
Well yes a year ago there was a huge tx backlog on the network before segwit properly kicked in. I remember it got so bad even I was calling for bigger blocks.. but shortly after that it all self corrected and now its great + lightning network just boosts the whole infrastructure to a whole new level. This is just the beginning, Bitcoin hasn't even got out of bed yet, it barely flexed when the world nearly went mad in Dec 2017.

@_date: 2018-12-12 21:21:07
Bitcoin is the safest medium of exchange on the planet. It's backed by everyone who has a copy of the ledger. An apolitical, global ledger, completely immutable with more redundancy and security than any bank could ever match. Virtually instant, low fee transactions, predictable supply. Layer 2 solutions, atomic swaps, more privacy inbound. A single currency for everyone to use no matter where you are with consistent and persistent value across borders (much easier to detect if you're being ripped off from one country to another). And all this without a central authority dictating the rules, but rather a consensus driven protocol. Maybe I'm a shill, high on 'hopium', or maybe these are just the facts. There's no reason to be pessimistic at all. Shit doesn't get more legit than this.

Absolutely- I can see tons of current government functions that are ez pickings for decentralization. e.g. deeds office, identity management like IDs, drivers licences etc.. , and social security (as you say). 
The jugular would be money system, taxes and armed forces. And the money system is potentially slipping away from them already... 
@_date: 2017-06-26 18:32:56
Thankfully, I managed to get a chunk of coins off Poloniex before they stopped withdrawals. But I still got a fair chunk that's in total limbo. On positive note- one user on Twitter just said they finally received a withdrawal. So I'm hoping its just a simple backlog ...

Shut your hole
@_date: 2018-12-18 10:23:16
I've seen them around. They completely discount the risks early adopters take and like to make believe in a perfectly equitable airdrop that also disregards the impracticality of a highly decentralized system in doing so. It's lovely pie in the sky thinking that's simply impossible in reality.

My overarching point is that if people are so concerned about Bitcoin's electricity consumption, they should be more concerned with electricity consumption of Gold and Banks in the same breath- then I'm open to discussion when it's a comparison. Why do they get a free pass while environmentalists shit all over Bitcoin?
Changing Bitcoin's minting algorithm comes with its own problems too.

There's no such thing as a private blockchain

@_date: 2017-06-24 20:11:58
There is no cancel button, or TxID being generated on mine. It just says "pending approval". I received an automated message saying a security agent must manually authorise withdrawal.. something about ensuring security of funds bla bla. I've got 4 withdrawals just under $2k different cryptos all getting caught on the way out. This is an extremely troubling situation brewing and it's really starting to alarm many of us. Poloniex must clear their damn backlog and release client funds to them. This is outrageous..

My initial reaction might be similar but the truth is Bitcoin is multidisciplinary and cuts across so many categories from maths, finance, economics, culture, philosophy, politics, psychology, science and probably a lot more areas.

@_date: 2018-12-12 17:28:21
I think the point is a credit product developed on the back of sound money is a lot better than credit created on the back of fractional fiat and derivative markets. The former is sound, the latter is a house of cards.

Obviously what we are after is separation of money and state. I'm no anarchist at all in fact they're crazy to me, but I am the limited government type. Libertarians tend to get drawn to crypto because of the promise of some semblance of sovereignty from shitty government decision making. I think that's a future worth believing in- and yes I believe Bitcoin is the closest vehicle we've got to getting there as it weaves its way into the fabric of society. To me the fundamentals look good, the network is still strong, the protocol is still strong and the proliferation continues.

As far as I can see, Trezor supports BTC, LTC, DASH, Zcash, ETH, and all ERC20 tokens. I think Trezor has also taken steps to ensure safety of coins through the segwit upgrade.

It doesn't work that way.  moral authority transcends both religion and moral relativism. Most religions are merely different flavours of the same attempt to guide our lost souls towards the same light. e.g Hinduism, Buddhism and Christianity are basically saying the same thing in their own way. i.e Don't be evil. 
@_date: 2018-12-28 03:45:51
His core philosophy aligns with Bitcoin's. He doesn't want laws (specifically a bill that was tabled in Canada) telling him what linguistics he can and cannot use. It's how radicalized progressives have been seeking more and more control and power over everyone else. They're too PC, and it stifles criticism to the point of facism. 
He sees political correctness and PC enforcers as a form of censorship because you not allowed to say certain things without the State using its monopoly on force to take you down. 
Basically Bitcoin is pro 1st Amendment and so is Peterson.

I've also got funds stuck waiting approval for about 5 days. Something happened and they're keeping very quiet about it, perhaps trying stealth fix before some kind of panic.
