Quick attack! Enemy of the people

Lol if that's what the government said without adding more buses the people would revolt

Some stuff it's not allowed to be discussed here

If there was just one bus servicing all the people of the city, it wouldn't work well for the population. Surely you would increase the number of buses so that more people would be able to travel

R/bitcoin community hates everyone not aligned with blockstream 
@_date: 2017-12-15 12:03:59
And you are the one who determines what the main chain is? Good for you
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:54:15
Thanks for that.
Blockstreams business plan is still to make the fees go through the roof so they can come and save the day via liquid.

Not sure, Hopefully there can be some smart way to improve it. But to me it also seems to be very limited and destined to be centralised

I'm not talking about lightning. That will push their own. For example "liquid"
@_date: 2017-08-25 00:15:08
I think its to limit centralization such that it limits very large hubs being created by big players such as exchanges etc 
@_date: 2017-08-26 12:26:00
Yes bcore will be, they will implement their solution into default software and everyone will use it

If one of the parties computer is off/wallet not connected, when you try to send it. It would return an error message or something along the lines.   
@_date: 2017-08-25 05:02:12
@_date: 2017-08-25 02:09:36
All parties have to be online at the time of sending. If the channel is closed before the whole transfer get signed by all three parties the money stays
@_date: 2017-08-25 18:25:55
I think you are right

Electrum wallet is open source
@_date: 2019-06-27 08:14:09
I think BTCB by binance will achieve that. It's a coin that is pegged to BTC price based on binance chain

You should have paid 100 dollars of fees, then it may have worked

Wouldn't buy a coffee with $2 fee

@_date: 2019-06-02 20:29:00
Use coin base or binance or some other exchange
