The cost of sending it to your new wallet is the same as sending it to them.

I use Blockfolio. You can choose which exchange to view and can input your trades to show your portfolio value.

Use your Coinbase details on Gdax. Get it verified and then deposit in Gdax and choose to deposit from Coinbase wallet.

From my understanding the community is against an increase in block size because it would cause centralisation. 
What would be the effect if instead of increasing the block size for every block, 1 block in every 36 or so was a bigger block? There's 16MB of unconfirmed transactions. Even a single 2 or 4MB block every 6 hours would have it cleared quickly. Is that sort of thing possible? Would it work or help?

I've got nothing on an exchange so can't take advantage. No cash to deposit either, pay day end of this week. Just watching.

I agree they paid way more than they should have to but I meant they didn't get fucked over in the sense that they were scammed or ripped off by Coinbase.

I only have a very small amount, after ignoring it for so long thinking it could never keep going, and I'm obsessed. I only made my first purchase in October. It's not even about the money, I just wanna say I told you so in the future to all the doubters.

Best thing to do is probably buy $50 worth in Gdax and transfer it to her from Gdax for free.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:14:00
4% is the fee on purchases I believe, not transfers.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:57:47
Blockfolio is free and does it as well. I'd recommend trying that 1st. You can include data from any exchange and any coin.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:58:08
Where do you have them? If they are on Coinbase first thing you should do is move them to Gdax. You don't pay fees on maker transactions.
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:13:14
I made the same mistake when I first bought. I used Coinbase and paid a fee to buy and then a fee to move to my wallet. It wasn't as bad as op because fees were still low then. I learnt after that there was a fee free method by using Gdax instead.

I posted on r/btc 4 weeks ago that bcash winning means everyone loses. They can't win by taking down bitcoin because to win would destroy all confidence in crypto. They can only win by either being something different and coexisting or winning very gradually and eventually overtaking bitcoin. A flippening would be death for everyone. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:55:52
It's because it has benefited them. If it was the other way round then they'd be very much against it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:00:41
You do but there's enough up and down in the market that you don't really need to.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:45:28
Thanks, yes looks about right. Slightly different in each direction. I guess the answer I'm looking for is "it depends".
Crazy that in a market of $230b such a small amount can have such a big effect.

Poker is a zero sum game, less if you include the house's share. Bitcoin doesn't require someone else to lose for you to win. We can all be winners (or losers).

BCash wants to be bitcoin and is trying to convince people that it is the real bitcoin, but it's not.
It has some benefits, cheaper transactions etc. at this moment in time but it's not bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:47:33
A big drop and a rise so all of the buy and sell orders disappear. That's why it keeps jumping up and down.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:53:30
Because only the coins being traded affect the trade price. All the holders aren't affecting the price. They are limiting the supply to buyers which causes the price to increase or vice-versa.
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:38:08
You didn't get fucked. That is the cost of a transaction currently unfortunately. Coinbase don't keep any of it. In future, transfer to Gdax 1st. Gdax pay the transaction fee when sending from them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:12:16
Bitcoin cash is the one claiming it is the real bitcoin. That is why there is an objection to bitcoin cash using the name, they are trying to steal the name which is a scam to any newcomers that don't know the difference.

Nothing like a pyramid. You are buying an asset. People in early have more but 1 of theirs is worth the same as 1 of yours. Pyramids rely on new "investors" paying referrals up a chain. That doesn't exist with Bitcoin. It could be a bubble but if it ends up worthless then the people at the top lose just the same.

Not sure if there's a PC version. I have it on android

Thanks, that's interesting. So mathematically, what are the chances of successfully mining a block? Aka how many tickets are in each draw and what resources does 1 ticket look like?

Salary, so £GBP.
@_date: 2017-11-16 13:28:36
Blockfolio. Enter your trades and it keeps a track and shows you your current portfolio value.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:59:08
So it is in effect still a lottery but the mining pools have more tickets and are therefore more likely to win the lottery? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 14:28:41
Probably just sat in my current account as spare cash as that's where it came from. I don't have much BTC, only 0.1.

100 million currently. Potentially more if needed

Get an EUR account on Revolut and SEPA to there. You can then transfer to your Revolut GBP account at interbank rate and then to your bank. It might be cheaper.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:12:26
It'll probably be banks, they'll charge a fee, maybe pay interest and give it loans and then nobody will be able to tell the difference between fiat and crypto.

I'm not an expert but I think difficulty adjust at fixed points in time or after a certain number of blocks so difficulty won't adjust until that occurs.
@_date: 2017-11-03 23:00:42
No. It's like someone recommending Amazon as a place to buy stuff. They are the most well known, the place most people have used and therefore the most likely to be recommended.

There are no fees when transferring from Gdax. You get the amount you sent, the fee is paid by Gdax.
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:33:17
That's exactly what happened in the 90s, 00s in tech. It's a relatively small number of people that would benefit massively.

The express is a fear mongering paper. Every single story is negative.

I nearly bought some a while back. They were £6 each. My Usenet search engine had been shut down and the recommended alternative was only accepting bitcoin. I ended up googling a bit and found somewhere that sold them but I'd have had to buy 5. I only wanted 1 so I left it while I looked for something else. Found another Usenet search engine that was free a few days later. "Saved" myself £30. If I had spent the 1 and kept the 4 I'd now have £16-18k.

Once it stops appreciating, which will only be once it is ubiquitously used, it can be used to make purchases.

The risk is that nobody uses it. At the moment it is driven by people who are very technically adept. However, the vast majority of people can't see the point in it. It currently has 0 utility. If you can't see the risk then you're not looking. It is currently expected that the value will continue to rise once more and more people are aware of it and get in on it which is far from certain.
I get it but people that trust banks don't. When you keep your money in a bank you are protected and people understand it. Your bank gets hacked, it gets recovered. What if someone hacks your wallet? All your money is gone. Not everyone will be willing to be their own bank account.
