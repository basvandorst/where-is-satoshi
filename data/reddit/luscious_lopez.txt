You know, I'd say you're crazy/insane.  But in January 2017 if you told me we'd be at 16k, I'd have called you crazy/insane.

Bitcoin is pretty awesome.  Whats the point of going to the casino anymore if you can just pump in money each payday and watch it roll all day.

This sounds like getting a speech from Eisenhower about a great crusade before we all hit the beach on Normandy and get fucked up.  
But fuck it, we're here, might as well hang on and see what happens.

Why would you pay taxes if you transfer bitcoin to a paper wallet?  
You're not selling for a gain or a loss, so there are no tax consequences until you sell.

Its more than 400k dude lol.  
They're gunning for the big fish that withdrew out 500k - Millions that haven't reported shit.  
While they do care about the average persons 2-3k profit because it adds up, they don't care as much as they do about the big fish that made millions.

Thats what it is.  Spot on.  This is why its met with so much resistance from people in real life.  
They see that you made thousands in gains last year, and can't believe that they missed the train.  Then they want it to crash so you're not more successful than them instead of going in to succeed themselves.  Crab in a bucket mentality.

That was like 4 days ago man

Getting worth more by the minute

If people didn't use Bitcoin, it would have no value.  
Yes you buy as an investment, but long term goal is usage.  
Hence why we have altcoins that are suited to have even better small transactions, such as Litecoin.  I invest in all 3 that are big: Bitcoin, Litecoin, Ethereum.

Theres a little bit of hard work in there too in some instances.  But I do agree, it is alot of timing and luck.  You can get there by hard work, but hard work doesn't guarantee success, it just raises your chances of meeting that good luck and timing.  
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:54:28
Yep, coulda bought some google back then too.  Fuck it, look forward, not backwards.

I don't own much of any coin, I just keep watching the price rise and being hesitant.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:56:37
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:54:35
Yeah fuck that, rather invest that amount even more, and be sure that I don't have to work ever again.

If it goes to $8 then something has gone severely wrong.  Might as well hold at point.

You know, I never followed trendy memes and hated it when the internet would beat jokes into the ground.  
With that said, I hope the over 9000 meme makes all over the fucking internet and pisses off everyone on reddit. The more awareness and more people talking about it, the better.

People like you are what drives its worth.  Cryptos are meant to be spent, someone has to spend it to have a community.  So thank you for doing so.

Litecoin is pretty darn good, but people seem to discount it.  The fees are much lower than Bitcoin, and the transactions much quicker.  
But no need to pick sides, just buy them all.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:50:38
Made me LOL.  Pretty simplistic, but spot on.  
@_date: 2017-11-06 04:31:50
It was said at $15, 100, 1000, 3000, 5000, 7000
@_date: 2017-11-26 06:42:55
Those 100k can't even trade alot until they are verified.  The boom should take off in 2 days then.  
@_date: 2017-11-26 18:46:29
do it
@_date: 2017-11-02 01:04:01
Consistency is good.  Litecoin and Bitcoin are both great.  No need to pick sides.

Nobody looks at baseball cards anymore man

Could go to 1 mil, could go to 10 mil.  If the man wants to roll the dice, let him.  Best of luck!

Life is best lived without a jealous attitude.  Realize that you are more fortunate and less fortunate than many.  You have the right mentality.  
If someone produces content that people like and are rewarded for it, good on them.  If you hate on them, might as well hate on all the pro ball players too.

A few months ago, you'd be mocked.  But with how the market is going, who the hell knows.
