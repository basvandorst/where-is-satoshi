Fiat is government issued money - euros, pounds, yuan, rupiah, dollars etc. An exchange is like a money changing bureau where you exchange one currency for another.
Good luck. Scammers rely on abusing people's judgement and particularly rely on exploiting people's better nature but hey, as you say, it's only $40. It isn't the 99% of good people who pose the risk, it is the 1% of sharks.
And as others have mentioned, nobody has any reason to trust you for that matter. You might be one of the 1% :)

Get back to him and say "yeah bae was soooo good, wanna meet up again?". Get him to pick the spot and use your network to get some local mates in his vicinity to meet him for some rubber hose decryption. Voila. Social engineering beats hacking every time, you can have that for free. Good luck!
PS if it turns out he is in SE Australia pm me, I might be able to help with the decryption for a fee ;). It'll need to be fiat only though, I dont touch bitcoin.

How would you form a decent level of trust with a stranger on reddit? This post will be like a magnet for people who would scam you in a heartbeat.
For example, you make an arrangement with someone who looks trustworthy. You send them the paypal money and they send you zero bitcoin in return. What do you do then?
Nobody, even legit people, would send you bitcoin in advance of you paying them as there would be no way for them to recover their coins in the event that you are scamming them.
Do yourself a favour, make your purchase in fiat or get your bitcoin from a reputable and established source exchange, not a stranger on reddit.
