Real arguments don't really matter in a propaganda war. You can make the best argument and be 100% factually correct, but in the end it doesn't matter, because who the winner turns out to be almost always comes down to human psychology. Simplicity appeals to the average mind.
My point is, if you're trying to convince a large group of people (with varying intelligence and educational background) of something, the most effective thing you can do is probably to reduce your argument to a small fraction of its original size and make a simple, yet impactful statement.
The truth seldom matters, unless it's actually undeniable.

Haha! Well, I guess the definition of what the meaning of "undeniable truth" is could be interpreted differently depending on whom you ask, so you make a fair point in that regard. :)

You're right. The rocket should be facing the other way since rockets are faced downwards when going upwards.

I'm with you, the more educated people are about this matter, the better. However, the amount of knowledge required to grasp what the pros and cons of each side are is just beyond the reach of most people. How do you know whether or not you're filtering through layers of propaganda-shit-fests? Sadly, you probably need to devote a large portion of your life to understanding the ins and outs of Bitcoin to be able to answer that question. 
In the end, propaganda and cofirmation bias win almost every time.
Edit: Also, if you can actually demonstrate credibility, that helps a lot in proving your point(s). If people think your opinion matters, then it does.

Huge numbers are usually good for marketing and publicity. 
@_date: 2017-09-10 05:24:06
Publicity, feels more trustworthy than buying from an online website, good introduction to Bitcoin by bridging the gap between the old and the new, makes impulse buys easier etc.

You've only made money on paper. You would need to sell some of your hodlings in order for your Trezor to have paid for itself. This should be clear to you when/if the price drops to $3k.

No, even 2019 is in the future so that would not be possible either. It was taken, or made, year(2017)-to-date or earlier. Anything later is impossible, unless someone invented a time machine.
@_date: 2017-10-01 16:58:24
Hahaha, "yes!"

Do you really think that this photo could be from 2021? It is 2017 now. Do time machines exist? No. Conclusion: This photo is either "photoshopped" and/or taken no later than 2017 to date. The title suggests that this photo is a representation of what could happen in, or around, 2021, where one bitcoin is worth, as suggested in the title, "a pallet" of the United States dollar. Thus, this photo is not from 2021.

In the case of ICOs, I think 99% or more would be a more accurate estimate.

I have Asperger's Syndrome but I try to make jokes when I realize people aren't being serious. For example, I said that the earth is flat as a response to naterussel3395. 
@_date: 2017-10-01 01:44:00
Sorry, it was not my intention.
Edit: I should make it clear that I think that the picture is almost certainly unrelated to Bitcoin (even if backwards time travel was theoretically possible).
@_date: 2017-10-25 17:36:57
That will never appeal to the masses.

I sold at $3000 at a loss because of this post and now bitcoin is at 3600. I was holding but you made me think it was stupid and now I lost a lot of money. Please send it back if you can.

It's unlikely that we will ever be able to backward in time. It is however, depending on how you look at it, theoretically possible to go forward in time (and you will be "stuck" there), but that won't happen in decades or possibly centuries.

ICOs aren't inherently bad. The problem is that basically all ICOs right now are complete shit. When these projects go to 0, and more than 99% of them will within a few years, people will learn their lesson. As a result, they will be more careful with their money. That's when the shitstorm settles, and ICOs can finally be taken seriously.

The earth is flat, and this photo was not taken in 2021. Furthermore, I'm a human, not a sheep. I have science on my side on all three of these points.

Hmm, you actually have a point. Maybe I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:13:12
If you believe either side based on things that have nothing to do with the actual relevant facts, you have become part of what should probably disturb you. My point is, whatever you think of r/bitcoin or r/btc has nothing to do with which side is actually right.

The problem is, if you just want to buy "Bitcoin," which one do you buy? Most people have no clue what Core and Segwit2x are. It will scare a lot of people away from buying either of the two. People want to buy "Bitcoin." Now of course, if there's a clear winner within a few days, it wouldn't be a problem, but what if there's a 50/50 split in support between the two? "Bitcoin" as a brand would seize to exist and be replaced with "Bitcoin Core" and "Bitcoin Segwit2x." 
On the flipside, however, if one exchange lists Bitcoin Core as "Bitcoin" and another exchange lists Segwit2x as "Bitcoin," things could get even messier. 
What will happen is probably that some larger exchanges will just list either of the two as "Bitcoin." Other exchanges will have no choice but to follow, and the winner will be chosen that way.
For example, if Coinbase, Bittrex and Bithumb list Core as "Bitcoin," that's what everyone will buy. If the smaller exchanges don't follow, they will either lose customers (in the case of not listing any coin as "Bitcoin") or lose customers AND credibility (listing Segwit2x as "Bitcoin" in this example). Why is this? Most people have no idea which one of  "Core" and "Segwit2x" is actually the better. They just want what everyone else is having.

Great news! ShapeShift is very convenient, and I continue to use it occasionally even though you support 2x. With that said, I hope you take a moment to reflect on your stance on 2x. Why do it now and risk dividing the community, when it can be done later with everyone on board? In the end, we all want the same thing.

You could have made some serial dough selling high and rebuying low though.

It would be much better if they added some music and sound effects.
