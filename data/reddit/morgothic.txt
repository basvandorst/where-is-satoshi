OK, my mistake. The firearms industry gets the most attention here because it seems to be getting the most pressure and it's the only one specifically covered by a constitutional amendment (I guess pornography is covered by the first amendment, but it's not the specific intent of the amendment and I haven't heard about any porn companies going out of business due to this illegal operation). 
Many of the things on that list are illegal here and many more are common fronts for fraud and identity theft operations, so I can understand why they're on the list. But firearm sales are already highly regulated, and again, it's covered by the constitution.
@_date: 2016-08-14 10:34:40
Yeah, it apparently covers several other industries, but firearms are clearly the main focus.
It's also relevant to Bitcoin because Bitcoin could be a tool for legal and legitimate companies to stay in business when banks and credit card processors refuse them service.
@_date: 2016-08-15 00:56:17
It's bad for Bitcoin because operation choke point also targets other industries including money transfer and currency exchange businesses like coinbase and bitpay.
But it can also be good for Bitcoin because legitimate businesses that can't find payment processors to provide them with service can turn to Bitcoin as a way to collect and store money.

Obama has spent his entire second term trying to enact stronger gun control legislation with no success. So he went around Congress by using executive orders and the agencies under his authority to impose as much restriction on the second amendment as he can. Operation choke point is a program where the department of justice puts pressure on bank's and other financial institutions to stop doing business with the firearm industry. Lots of gun stores and smaller manufacturers have had their accounts with bank's and credit card processors closed for no reason other than they sell guns. Quite a few places have gone out of business because they can't find anyone willing to handle their money.

Yours says 1103 minutes and your post is 5 hours old. 1103 minutes is just over 18 hours. Add that to your just under 6 hour old comment equals 24 hours. By 24 hours, most threads have little or no traffic. It looks like they reveal the scores once the traffic has all but stopped.

Your comment is 8 hours old and the score is still hidden. When I hover over the [score hidden] it says "score will be revealed in 950 minutes which is just short of 16 hours. That would imply the scores are hidden for 24 hours. Most threads are all but completely dead after 24 hours, so basically they release the scores once the traffic to the thread has almost completely stopped.

Since it's the employee that's asking to be paid in BTC, it's safe to assume that he is aware of market fluctuation and is willing to take the risk.
As for labor laws, I can't speak to the state laws as we don't know what state they're in, but I believe (please correct me if I'm wrong) that the federal government has recognized BTC as a currency and thus should be legal for use as payment of employees assuming they agree to be paid in BTC. It might be prudent to have the employee sign a waiver stating that he agrees to be paid in BTC just as a CYA measure.

He didn't acquire an extra year's salary. At the beginning of this year, BTC was valued at about ~$800-900 per coin. Now it's hovering around $300-400. So if your BTC holding was $200k at the high point of this year, you're down over $130k at the low point so far this year.
Unless he's actually spent 2 year's salary on BTC to have lost, he's not as bad off as he makes it sound. And if he has spent 2 year's salary on BTC, that's a *serious* problem considering BTC has only been around for ~5.

The one problem with knowing your rights is that they will only help you in court later, not on the side of the road when the cop is searching your vehicle. If a cop pulls you over and decides that he wants to search you, there is really nothing you can do to stop him. You can spout the 4th amendment at him until you're blue in the face, it's not going to make him stop searching. And if you try to physically stop him, you are now under arrest for obstruction, resisting arrest and assaulting an officer - and those charges *will* stick regardless of how many amendments the officer was violating at the time. In the end, nothing the officer finds during an illegal search will be admissible in court, but anything illegal or even suspect will be confiscated and not returned.
So long story short, any charges against you will be thrown out, but you will still lose your wealth.

When they're actually loaning you money on an ACH transfer and not actually charging your credit card unless your checking account doesn't have enough to cover the buy order, yes, they should have the ability to ensure that you don't have a history of screwing creditors.

I bought my first btc at $900 on the downward side of the 2013 peak. But I've been buying all the way down too. My break-even is about $480 right now, but I'm not too worried.
@_date: 2015-01-07 09:06:15
When you buy directly with ACH, it's not instant. If you don't have a credit card attached to your account, you have to wait for the funds to clear before they give you your coins. I have a standing buy order for every other Wednesday (payday). The buy order is initiated on Wednesday night, the funds are debited from my account on Friday, and my coins are available in my coinbase account on the following Tuesday. There is no risk to them when someone buys directly using ACH. If the funds aren't available when they try to pull them, they simply cancel the order.
On the other hand, if you attach a credit card to your account, you can get the coins instantly. So theoretically, you could place a buy order, move the coins to a different wallet and then put a chargeback on the order and get your money back. If your attached checking account is empty, they have no way to get paid for the coins they gave you. Running a credit check is a simple way to ensure that you don't have a history of chargebacks or any other behavior that might indicate potential scamming on your part.

If this means that the employee in question is contracted labor rather than an actual employee of the company (meaning he receives a 1099 instead of a w2 for tax purposes), then technically he is self-employed or employed by the contractor company. If this is the case, then the labor laws are very different than those for regular employees. For one thing, OP's company isn't responsible for garnishing taxes from his wages or paying employment taxes for him. I believe there is also no minimum wage for contracted employees as most of them get paid by the job and they usually have more control over what they're paid than regular employees.
Of course, I am not a lawyer nor do I own a business, so I could be wrong. It would probably be prudent for OP to check both with the DOL and with a lawyer that specializes in labor law to ensure he's not opening himself up to legal trouble.

I made my first BTC purchase in Dec 2013 on the down side of the first $1000+ peak. It was in the high $900s for my first purchase and steadily fell to ~$200 through 2014. I made small purchases with each paycheck until Dec 2015 when I lost my job. By the time I had to sell my coins to pay bills, between buying enough cheap coins to offset the expensive coins I started with and letting the price rally (I sold in the ~$600 range), I made a pretty decent net profit. 
I'm working again and I've started buying again. If the price keeps climbing, great. I'll keep buying. If the price drops, that's fine too. I'll keep buying. If I hadn't had to sell due to financial need, I'd still have those coins and I'd still be buying.
The moral here is not to worry about dips in the market. When the price drops, buy more. Never panic sell. Just look at the prices over the last 4 years:
* Dec '13 - $1000
* Dec '14 - $200
* Dec '15 - $600
* Dec '16 - $1000

I bought my first bits on the back side of the $1k bubble at the end of 2013. Then I watched as it fell all the way down to ~$200, buying a little bit with each paycheck along the way. By the time I was forced to sell due to unemployment and the need to eat, I had 2 coins and through cost averaging made a pretty decent profit.
I wish I hadn't had to sell because when I sold them, those 2 coins were worth about $1500, whereas now they'd be worth about $9k. But life doesn't always follow your plans.
Moral of the story: Never sell for a loss. And really, just never sell.

If it was a true reversal, meaning that the magistrate ruled against Sean's because there *were* numerous code violations and there *was* a clear emergency giving the code enforcement officer a legitimate reason to enter the property, and the commissioners tried to replace her with someone who would take Sean's side (you can posit your own reasons why the commission would want Sean's to stay in business), then yes, it would be unethical.
However, if the magistrate ruled against Sean's despite the evidence showing that the code enforcement officer was clearly in the wrong and the commission tried to replace her in an effort to right the wrong, then no, I don't think that's unethical.

I bought my first btc in December of 2013 when it was in the high $900s per coin. Then the bottom dropped out and it fell steadily down to the low $200s per coin. But instead of panicking and selling at a loss, I kept buying all the way down. I've bought a little bit with every paycheck since then and yesterday, for the first time since I started buying, I broke even. Right now as I write this, my coins are worth almost double what I paid for them. If the price goes up too much more, I'll stop buying for now. If it goes up high enough, I'll cash out only what I've paid in so the rest of it is just free money.
