Easy direct giving, prevention of loss due to physical theft (extremely common for the homeless), accountable usage of funds (if desired), connection to other identify-based services. Those off the top of my head.

Helping the homeless with Bitcoin-based debit cards is something that I really want to see. Services and direct giving tied to a crypto graphically secure identification system. The homeless face a constant threat of violence, robbery, and theft and giving them an immutable and recoverable method to secure their money would solve a lot of the daily problems they face, and in the process keep communities crime free by removing an incentive to do property crime.
