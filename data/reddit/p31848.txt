Yes, I am saying the same thing, though in general terms. Thanks for providing a very concrete scenario.

Could you please explain why not?

True. But won't it need to be profitable for miners to sustain whatever minimum hashrate may be required to secure the network (i.e. prevent/discourage an attack) through the rise in the value of BTC and/or increase in tx fees?

Exactly. The value of bitcoin needs to rise to at least 2x its current value so that miners find mining to be at least as profitable when the reward halves in 2016 as they do now.

I had a similar experience when two days ago I sent bitcoin via the Coinbase website. I immediately went to blockchain.info to track the tx, and was quite surprised to find that it was already included in the next block. This took less than a minute; I was expecting it to take about 10mins. So, how is this possible ? The tx carried a fee.

My question is adequately addressed in these posts:
[Bitcoin &amp; Tragedy of the Commons](
[[If tx limit is removed] Disturbingly low future difficulty equilibrium](
and 
[Will Bitcoin suffer from a mining Tragedy of the Commons when mining fees drop to zero?](
I remember now that I had actually read these posts before, but I was new to Bitcoin then and I didn't understand what they meant.

a) Can't send/receive money quickly - No specific service/product but the Bitcoin ecosystem itself. Recently a friend of mine who is new to Bitcoin wanted to buy something urgently with bitcoins. I lent him some BTC which he received in a few minutes. Later, when he wanted to repay me in fiat money, the whole process of setting up the bank transfer took 4 days! We wisely decided that we'll transact in BTC only.
b) Having to carry around loose notes and coins - A service that would make using BTC attractive to local shopkeepers and merchants in developing countries who deal with only cash. This would preclude having to remember to always carry around lots of paper notes, and coins for loose change.
