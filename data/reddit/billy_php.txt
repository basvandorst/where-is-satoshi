French here... 
Yeah 100% bullshit and 100% wrong title.
There is a lot of misunderstanding from non-French users on Reddit, especially because of all the wrong news/info written by international press.
Yellow vest want a major change in the french gouvernement, but they are not anarchist.
The reality is that only ONE person is calling for a mass withdrawal, like only ONE person is calling to burn Brigitte macron in a public place (yes this is true).
Do not pay attention to this "mass withdrawal", this will never happen.
Also, there is not censorship plan.
If its happen, be sure that you'll not need to read an article anywere, you'll see a massive post from all french user on social media.
Freedoom of speach/expression is the first value in France, no one want to censure it and no one on the French governement are thinking about this.

You'll be able to buy only(current price +7%) , not to sell.
You'll need to create an account on a third party system to get your coin.
You'll not be able to buy anything with your crypto on the tobacco.
Yeah, this is shit.
Edit:  is the third party.

Please elaborate, why do you think bitcoin will go to 0?
Do you think someone will sold their bitcoin for less than $1?

+1 op, that's my 1st thought when I was notified of the upgrade delay.
Edit: but that not mean that ETH is a shitcoin.
