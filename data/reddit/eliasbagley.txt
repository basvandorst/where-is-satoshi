Perfect time to buy some new RAM. Thanks!

The article says it's open source. Where is the code?

No, the password is a key. Obscurity relies on keeping the details of the cryptosystem or algorithm secret, not the key.

I don't like Glen Beck either, but that's an ad hominem fallacy. Attack the argument, not the person.

How does coinmap work for stores without a brick and mortar location?

This looks like a 2nd order underdamped system response.

If the price is always increasing, what gives people the incentive to spend bitcoins? I've heard the argument that you can transfer fiat to bitcoin, and then spent the bitcoin, but that means that you take a 1% hit on every transaction, if you use a service like Coinbase.

I agree, but we aren't there yet. People need to start spending Bitcoins before we can get to that point, and many people I talk to who have Bitcoins don't want to spend them, even if they had the opportunity, because they know the value is increasing.

I think you're right, but I also think that this is one of the more unlikely scenarios. Public key crypto has been around for a long time, and lots of people have tried to crack it. If it was cracked, many things other than Bitcoin (such as ssl, which is essential for ecommerce) will be broken too.

To everyone hinting that it's not worth your time to explain it: it is worth your time. For every person you tell, it plans the seed of the Bitcoin idea in their mind. When they hear it again in the future (and they will hear it again), they will be in a better position to understand it. More people need to understand it before more people begin to use it.

The title is a joke. The article shows that the current financial system is also very complicated

Do you know how they plan on handling the migration?

That sounds interesting. Can you point me somewhere that I can read more about this?

A private key is 256 bits, so there are 2^256 possible private keys. Assume that there are roughly 2^33 people on the planet, all with a single key (some may have multiple keys, some may have none, it probably averages out). The current hashrate of the entire Bitcoin network is around 7,000,000 GH/s. Assume that in the future, the attacker (group of attackers) has this much computing power to put towards cracking keys (btw, this is an absurd amount of computing power - very unlikely a single entity would have this much). So the expected time before cracking a key is:
(search space/number of active keys)/global hash rate = (2^256-33 )/(7000000 gH/s)/2 = 1.8319164e+42 years on average to crack a single key

What about the 1% that a service like Coinbase charges when you buy bitcoins?

wow they're really running out of people eh

Nothing really related to CS, but it shows up a lot in signal analysis, especially in mechanical engineering and electrical engineering. The easiest explanation from it is a mass-spring-damper system, meaning that there is a mass, which is connected to a spring (to store the energy of the system) and a damper (to remove energy from the system). If you model this mathematically (in laplace domain) relating force on the mass to the distance the mass moves, it is F = ms^2 +bs+k, where m is the mass, b is the damping constant, and k is the spring constant. I won't go into the detail, but essentially it's the s^2 which makes it a second order system, rather than a first order system. 
So, back to the second order response. If you were to exert a constant force on the mass, it is going to osscilate back and forth because of the spring, and eventually will settle down (because the damper is removing energy from the system. There are other things that can happen depending on how strong the spring is in comparison to the damper, but if there is oscillation, then the system is what we call "underdamped". The other alternatives are overdamped (the damper is much stronger than the spring), and critically damped (where the spring and damper balance each other). If you plot the system response of a underdamped second order system with a "step response" (the input goes from 0 and "steps" up to a different value", then you get a graph that looks like the one posted above.
