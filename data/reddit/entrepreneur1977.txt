what should we expect to the price after that timeline?
@_date: 2018-01-26 22:14:21
accumulation phase (hopefully it's not distribution instead)
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:55:28
Help me grasp the refrigerator joke
@_date: 2018-06-13 22:04:47
Aahhh the long gone tether pumps..
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:05:07
what are you buying? BTC or Altcoins? suggestion please
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:00:18
basically after the fork it will be even easier to mine BCH?
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:58:55
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:50:04
so the B2X is still imminent?? source?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:15:51
why so sure? I'm just asking
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:10:33
it's up to this person now, I wish you he's honest enough, being a small amount.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:07:31
IF you're not in a hurry you could postpone this transaction when network is not congestionated
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:45:44
thanks, and that chart is showing that in a few days the rewards for mining BCH will be a lot less? or I'm not reading it correctly?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:47:35
miners should switch from BCH to BTC because will be more profitable and more easy
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:20:12
what happens if the fork doesn't fix what is supposed to fix? is the new code open source? anyone could check it?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:06:03
how would I do this? Is it already late? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:42:32
no worries, someone is trying to accumulate BTC at this price before the BCH will lose a lot of hashrate power (less than 3 hours from now)
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:40:21
FunFair is a nice bet
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:12:20
what happens to the price when difficulty changes usually?
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:04:27
CME futures and BTC/B2X fight are 2 big issues indeed, but what do you mean "this time is no different"?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:46:24
maybe a stuck transaction?
less then 3 hours from now and the transaction queue will be flushed more quickly
@_date: 2017-11-11 17:48:55
but after the incoming bch fork the bch mining will be more easy or hard to achieve? thx
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:01:48
not so soon at all
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:12:12
Thanks to this man we had the subprime mortgages crisis, so who cares what he has to say?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:28:38


Please GTFO
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:36:55
where do you read that 19 days are needed please?
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:21:53
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:09:02
transactions queue is still around 180k right now, why?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:40:31
ok thanks
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:35:31
yes of course, that's the actual way to do it indeed: buy on exchange =&gt;transfer on private wallet
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:11:52
how much days before this queue is cleaned up?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:10:20
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:44:26
less then 3 hours from now and the transaction queue will be flushed more quickly
@_date: 2017-11-12 16:05:31
or au contraire, someone is accumulating under 6300 before suddenly lifting the sell wall 
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:54:57
BTC price kept &lt; 6300 by a 2200 sell order on Bitfinex.
How is possible to consume such a big sell wall? BTC is forced to have another retracement?
@_date: 2017-11-11 18:13:15
is BTC doomed? what would save in the short time? 
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:16:34
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:46:30
Just out of curiosity
If I left a limit order to buy at 7200 it would be executed or not in this fast crash dips on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-11-12 11:52:33
why do you follow this scumbag? 
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:04:23
you mean just like VTC and GRS are? this would save BTC from this attack?
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:39:24
12 hours ? you mean till the BCH fork ? thanks
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:44:16
it's called market manipulation, and it's nothing to be happy about
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:47:29
what is the exchange that disappointed you?
@_date: 2017-11-11 16:40:17
how can we check if this "hashrate power" abandoning is taking place or not? thanks
@_date: 2017-11-12 10:01:11
lol this is dumb but funny
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:10:08
why transactions queue is still around 180k right now?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:51:11
and this will be of any help to the transactions queue?
@_date: 2019-04-09 07:05:42
please help me understand why reducing 70% hash power is bullish?
@_date: 2017-11-12 12:20:05
how is that even possible? The USDT order book is never empty, you should have met a buy order. Or you sold for an altcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:08:47
why transactions queue is still around 180k right now?
@_date: 2018-11-19 18:57:45
what a joke POW has became
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:57:24
I'm still waiting for my ledger nano, when is deadline before forks?
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:45:01
You said you were just testing out EW. Did you recall if you copy pasted those words from a tutorial?
@_date: 2017-10-19 12:02:36
If you have the seed (a list of word) you can restore the wallet
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:53:58
What are the exact incoming dates when we should transfer BTC to our private keywallet?
@_date: 2017-10-19 11:34:43
At the time when you set up EW did you choose the password or a password generated from the program?
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:19:53
ok thanks
