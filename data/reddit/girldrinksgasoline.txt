Oh, I was talking about myself. I don't really trust anyone else to remember one of these passwords. I'm a solipsist so it doesn't really matter if I'm dead and my coins are lost forever.

Then you have to worry about keeping paper around, which would either be destroyed or seized (if stored in a safe deposit box)
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:41:00
Is there any protection if the paper is taken somehow?
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:37:14
I suppose, but isn't it always the expensive sunglasses you loose and the cheap ones that just keep popping up like a bad penny? It seems like the ability to keep something is inverse to your desire to keep it.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:40:07
I like the way you think.
@_date: 2017-01-02 20:35:35
I don't think so...in general my passwords for things are sentences that are easy to remember but hard to guess...something like: "My local Applebee's Bar &amp; Grill is the 3rd worst in the US." or "I have 7 CUTE squirrels in my garden! Too bad they eat my fruit. :P"

Well, I guess it would take the sting out of it a little bit. 15eKQn8ysYsTRQEteiVNvVhYCArLJCLqD4

Yeah, typo. Meant 2013. If I had been in in 2011 I would have bailed when it was at $1000.

A) Well, I don't want to have to get a call from the IRS at all. I'd rather not be audited as I keep terrible records.
B) Yeah, typo. Meant 2013. I wasn't smart enough to go through the trouble required to buy in 2011.

I'm using Copay/Bitpay. None of them are hardware wallets but one is a phone that is no longer connected and turned off unless at some point I need it to access that wallet. I figure that should be nearly as good as dedicated hardware as it is pretty hard to hack into something that is not on and not connected. I could be wrong though.
@_date: 2016-11-23 20:28:57
Yeah but they think because you need to lock up coins to act as a LN route, it will gravitate to only huge holders of BTC acting as centralized hubs for all the transactions. And since the blocks are so small on the base layer its not exactly like you'll be able to work around LN since they would be no space left. 
I don't really care either way about centralization. Just make bitcoin useful enough to be positioned to handle the amount of transactions at low enough fees that real micropayments and 3rd world adoption can be a reality. That's the most likely way I see us getting a real mainstream foothold and turning our coins into even more valuable assets. Right now, LN is the only thing that even begins to promise that.
Honestly though, we probably are going to need bigger blocks anyway eventually no matter what 2nd layer solutions we use. I still can't figure out how we could possibly survive a contentious hard-fork. Too bad Satoshi didn't tie block size doubling to reward the reward halving. That would have probably worked out fine given the gradual increase of storage space and bandwidth.

I'm sure I do have like $15 worth of tax liability if calculated on a FIFO basis. Hard to say but i'll note it. Thanks.
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:10:00
Yeah, I bought with a bank account. I haven't reported anything though as I have never realized any gain. Are you supposed to report unrealized gain every year?
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:13:30
Well they have the records that I bought coin, let it sit for 3 years and then transfered it somewhere. Saying I don't have it anymore isn't going to help me unless I can "prove" to the IRS that I "lost" my keys. I'm not looking to get out of paying taxes, I just don't want to pay taxes on money I didn't even make.
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:14:40
How do they know I didn't sell it? My wallet addresses aren't tied to me in any way besides the fact I have the keys.
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:08:47
Yes, but I don't even want it to get that far. I don't like the idea of an IRS guy pouring though all my records because they are terrible. I'd rather not get a call telling me I'm being audited. Even if you don't owe, it is a horrible experience I've heard.
@_date: 2016-11-23 04:44:17
Its funny, they say the same thing about LN.
@_date: 2016-12-16 03:17:29
I don't mind paying taxes if ever comes time to sell off my coins for USD. I just don't want to have to pay taxes BEFORE I do because I don't have nearly that much liquid USD right now. 
Also, f* that guy...I almost puked in that first episode of the season.

If you’re taught in and are trying to use US English and you unintentionally use British English, yes that is incorrect because it wasn’t what you were trying to do. That was the point of the humor of the guy’s statement. Being in such a bad school system that he doesn’t know how to spell correctly for his own country. Given that he wasn’t an American though, the humor is missing
@_date: 2019-04-20 18:31:15
Well, it’s not a problem, it would just be funny if he misspelled a word while lamenting about the bad education system in his country. As he isn’t American it’s moot from both angles.
@_date: 2019-04-20 08:45:44
I hope you’re not an American, because if you are one, your spelling of defense is super amusing given the content of your comment.
@_date: 2019-04-20 20:16:11
U no wat I’m getin at speling like dis to. Duzint make it rite
@_date: 2019-04-20 19:17:41
“Defence” is not correct US English spelling. I had to even erase that and retype several times due to autocorrect.

Ver is quoting a Medium article, and honestly just from my quick read, the guy who wrote it is an idiot who thinks the people supporting Core don't ever want to scale and want to keep Bitcoin tiny because....reasons. 
Core does want to scale, they just want to do it with another layer. BU wants to do it on chain, and most of them think that way because Lightning is taking too damn long and we've hit a wall NOW which is stalling growth. Honestly they're right about that part. Some of them just think LN is too complex to be workable, but those people are idiots. Anything is possible if you throw enough effort at it. It might just take a while.
The real solution is a compromise...make the on-chain space bigger to relieve pressure and buy more time to get LN going. Right now we're root-locked and we're still a-ways out from harvest. We need to transplant to a bigger pot so that we can make it to the REAL scaling solution. Somehow figuring out how to do that without forking us all in the ass is the hard part.
@_date: 2016-10-19 19:29:58
I hold this position. I do want LN to be implemented but it is going to take too long and in the meantime we are hitting a wall. Why should we stall growth in the meantime? Even after LN is fully cooked you're still going to need more than 1MB of on-chain space at some point. 
@_date: 2016-10-19 17:22:53
They aren't trying to fork the chain. They think if they get enough hashing power they'll essentially drag the rest of the community into their position. They think everyone else will cave into supporting larger blocks rather than lose their shirts by forking.

I think the more sane majority on the "other" side is not against SegWit; they just don't think its enough (more of a 1.7x increase once you factor in overhead) .I think now that SegWit is so close to coming online, the moral high-ground is probably with Core (when it honestly hasn't been for a long time because they were stalling with no available solution for so long). Now unfortunately you'd got a lot of crazy people on the big-block side who just think the Core is evil cuz for so long before now you COULD make a case they were the bad guys.
Myself, I'm not a hard-core technologist; I'm just someone who has a passing interest and ended up accidentally with a significant amount of BTC. I don't care HOW growth happens, only that it does so I can get a nice little trip to the moon. This fighting is certainly not helping my cause.

If this happens, all of us are incredibly wealthy.
