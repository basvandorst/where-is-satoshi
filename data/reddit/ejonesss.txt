but because of the "significant non infringing use" effect would the feds still bother with full nodes  because you are operating a gateway?

you do know why isps dont like you to run servers on residential accounts dont you?
they dont want you to use your home connection to run bandwidth heavy servers.
also they want to sell you the more expensive fiber optic systems.
you may notice that some towns have limits on yard sales that is because they dont want you to run a business in a residential zone bottlenecking the streets with everyone coming to the yard sales.
same thing with isps

this how data can be put in the blockchain as well as i think how the wallets get marked as viruses
@_date: 2019-07-15 13:20:58
running a full node over tor  can you imagine downloading 2.4 tb of data through tor?
tor cant even handle being used for p2p file sharing and there is a thing called initial download.
right now the blockchain is 200+ gig but the max size is 2.4 tb

then how did the tor exit node get busted for facilitating child porn
when they was just running a tor relay?
@_date: 2019-07-15 00:08:41
does A full (non validating) node post anything to the net?
meaning if you connect to A full (non validating) node will it relay the transactions to the network?

"Not true in any modern countries. Maybe you're in India or Egypt. Otherwise, no ISP is interested in users running servers. Are they banning Apple FaceTime?"

custodial wallets can be subpoenaed in theory  where as non-custodial  you have all the keys.
the main thing i want to know is since this is a non-custodial wallet there is nothing to subpoena.
now the big thing is how to connect it to a vpn or tor is there any settings on the device or is it all in the software?
i do know about not reusing addresses i know that electrum generates a new receive address   each time you receive bitcoin but does trezor do the same does it randomly generate new receive addresses and even new send addresses
dynamic addresses is key to stumping analytics.

with all the horror and fake news stories floating it is just a breeding ground for paranoia.
and with the fact that the irs usually goes after the big stuff first makes me thinking that running a full node may be risky there.
also i have heard of someone being busted for child porn for running a tor exit node because the activity was tracked back to the exit node.
question back on the table
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:42:05
the vpn i have is not in a country that is part of any eyes network and is a premium  and they take bitcoin for payment and it would be nice to pay with bitcoin.
i only mine i dont trade or invest so i dont have to worry about exchanges.
i do know that public free vpn/proxies are usually not very secure and could even be honeypots.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:25:29
let me set things straight here it seems as everyone thinks i am buying coins or investing or using exchanges i am also not cashing out to fiat i am leaving it as bitcoin and i will use the bitcoin to pay my vpn service bill.
i am only mining and then i would like to transfer the coins from my miner's wallet to my external wallet and use to pay my vpn service bill.
@_date: 2019-06-23 18:10:37
but if i am mining not trading then there is no exchange involved to get the bitcoin from the mining provideo/pool wallet to where i am going to spend the bitcoin witch is the vpn provider?
@_date: 2019-06-23 12:41:39
i am not buying or exchanging i am simple mining  that is using the gpu to solve math and get paid in bitcoin.
ok there is an exchange process involved but that is on the mining company's end not my end so i get btc.
i would withdraw to an external wallet then since my vpn provider takes btc as payment for the service it can mean i can using bitcoin pay for the vpn service for a while in advance and not have to pay fiat for a while there by saving like $15 a month.
if the irs taxation is so the united states can be funded then i would be perfectly fine for the feds and the irs to take over a node or even become a rogue node in the btc blockchain network and skim off a little bit from each transaction.
take over the network just like what the feds did for the dns changer malware they took over the malware's servers to ensure systems got patched.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:38:14
i do know or at least i have heard that they can trace to the ip but if the ip happens to be a tor or vpn of a country that is not part of the eyes network and is completely outside of the us jurisdiction.
but i am not sure if the blockchain keeps ip addresses that the feds can use or if they have to solely rely on the  exchanges like coinbase where they have to follow kyc/aml laws but hd wallets like electrum does not have to follow the kyc/aml laws.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:51:31
that is fine since mining is not exchanges it is using your computer to solve a math problem and earning crypto (bitcoin in this case)
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:41:57
my vpn is in a country that is not part of the eyes network because i asked 
my mining pool is outside the united states .
is the irs more interested in investors and exchanges than mining because mining makes so little in comparison?
@_date: 2019-06-22 23:53:50
with bitcoin prices coming back up the value of bitcoin is coming back and probably will be back to $20000 again.
the kyc/aml mostly is for exchanges
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:47:46
i only mine that is using a gpu to solve math and get paid bitcoin.
unless the mining provider is in one of the eyes countries i should be ok as mining is not buying or investing.
@_date: 2019-06-24 12:54:24
i did in the beginning sign up for coinbase but i abandoned it because their id selfie system was not working it was refusing to take the card so i would rather pay the 0.0001 btc network fee than to have coinbase problems.
@_date: 2019-06-22 21:13:20
that does not answer the question can the irs see through a vpn and tor to uncover the real ip  address?
@_date: 2019-01-29 03:56:00
can they detect if you are reporting false losses?
@_date: 2019-01-27 10:30:34
i was saying that because it seems now adays religion can be used to commit illegal acts under.
you can use religion to legally not bake a cake, set up photo shoot of wedding, not custom tailor a wedding dress or otherwise discriminate  something that the equal rights laws enacted after the death of Martin Luther King  was supposed to criminalize including denying employment, housing and other stuff based on color, gender and race
@_date: 2019-01-26 19:13:27
how would they be able to trace the bitcoin to the ip address if you are connecting to your wallet via tor or even a vpn that is in a bulletproof country?
@_date: 2019-01-27 10:33:25
yes they can trace it back to the wallet address but can they trace the wallet address to an ip address if it is a burner wallet where the receiving address is only used once? and is done via a vpn in a country that refuses to help investigators.
i would be happy to pay tax if they did it as a sales tax instead.
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:30:49
so the internal wallet of mining provider is a custodial wallet
fortunately electrum wallet generates a new wallet address each time money is deposited so for a custodial wallet to non custodial wallet transfer is impossible?
electrum is a non custodial wallet 
@_date: 2019-01-26 21:28:00
it is against my religion to pay taxes
