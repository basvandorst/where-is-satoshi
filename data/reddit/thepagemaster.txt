Hey if this guy does not want to take the first step and read the sidebar, there is nothing more we can do for him.

As a non CPA this brings a tear to my eye. Thanks for looking out.
@_date: 2014-01-12 16:26:42
Ive been wondering the same thing. I made this. You can watch it and see if someone knows.

Bitcoin is changing the way we handle transactions everyday. Doing things like this I feel compels people to get interested in it. "free bitcoin heck yea let me find out what that is so I can get some" Good on you OP

I agree with you. Im tired of all the memes. Seeing 3 different posts on the front page of the same article. Its getting out of control.
@_date: 2013-12-04 04:48:48
There are actually 4 posts about this on the hot page. Including the one you mentioned at the top.

Cry about it why don't you. Your comment is 3 hours old. You're at 6 currently so now you just look like a whiny brat.
If you cant handle a couple of downvotes maybe dont comment. 
Edit: aaannnnd I'm downvoted... (insert unrealistic reason for being downvoted here)

nah it was cool. If anything I learned how to pronounce the name of your company! lol
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:31:04
haha! That was the first time I've ever done that!
@_date: 2013-12-10 20:41:30
Im right there with you. I bought my first one at 998. It was disappointing to see it drop so quick knowing with a little patience I could have bought in at a lower price. I bought more at about 650. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:07:00
ah ok. The "why'd you make it so hard" threw me off.

I hate you.

Thanks for the awesome fun. I was trying everything I could to figure it out. Even watched your interview on coinsider this to gain some possible insight as to what the passphrase might have been.
@_date: 2013-12-15 04:46:27
Its a physical coin containing a bip38 encrypted private key. There is a link to his site in the very first comment.

This isnt how a pm works.
@_date: 2013-12-09 23:48:53
Haha yea! I thought it sounded familiar! Have to say that is pretty cool!
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:00:34
What is this flip business? I just learned about rolls yesterday.

Its my understanding that mining with a cpu is extremely inefficient. I know that is true for bitcoin. I'm not sure if it is the same for others.

Thats the place where the girl dances in the window for bitoin isnt it?
