I don't think so, no. I think every time it goes up it will stay there, as I said no one who isn't loaded with tons of BC and is cashing out (and even then unless they think the market will crash they have an incentive to spread out their sales, not flood the market and push down the price) will only sell at the top level they saw it reach, since they think it's now worth that. 
I think it will be quite a while and require a major event to drop the prices down, such as being outlawed, or the only real economy (illegal sales) shift away due to crack down on markets or another alternative option.
Those sales are largely priced in say USD, the seller wants X amount in USD and just uses the BC conversion amount. So those people buy in BC at that amount and immediately hand it over to the sellers, they don't give a hoot what the conversion rate is. So anyone could start another coin system (since it doesn't matter what the value per unit is) and if the underworld decides to switch to/promote that (such as they get to start out with 3 million units), BC becomes a nice downward spiral.
And it just sucks because for what you are willing/able to initially invest you will in my case have 1/3rd of what you could have had. So say you invest more at this point (3 times as you would otherwise) you would be back to where you could have potentially be, but that assumes you're able and willing to scrounge up the extra money.
I thought about doing a wire direct to mtgox after Dwolla was taking it's sweet fucking time, but didn't want to pay the fees, which amounted to about 4% since it was holding steady at $17-19. Well delay fucks you in the ass sometimes...

Here's hoping for a massive sell off down to $1.
Otherwise I'm going to go start my own ~~ponzi scheme~~ online currency. It will be better because I'll integrate it into Facebook so people can buy in game shit and send money to friends. And it will be priced in USD, and the amount of the underlying currency will be not visible to them. 500 million stupid Facebook users &gt; 150k nerd BC users.
And then on the backside I'll seed criminal organizations with relatively large quantities of currency units, as bribery so that they encourage and use my currency, which is only more win-win for them as the value of those starter units will only increase in value the more they use them to send money between themselves and collect it from their "customers."

The market is crashing, you better sell whatever you have and get whatever you can, this shit is going to the bottom.
If you have a lot of BC you should sell now before it gets below $5 again.

Yeah if I was doing it... Put PC on ground. Take large cardboard box* cut holes in two sides, attach fans. Put box over PC. Go do something else.
*if large cardboard box unavailable, put fans on ground, take cardboard and attach from one fan to other around PC. Go do something else.
Oh, wait PC cases already have fans and shit to move air through them. So forget all that, new plan.
Put PC on ground. Go do something else.

Yay for wanting to buy in at $8 and it taking fucking forever to get money into mtgox. $8 to $24 in 9 days. Fucking retarded.
And once people see it at that, no one wants to offer to sell below that.
@_date: 2011-06-08 06:18:38
I checked my email of when I signed up for Dwolla, was the 3rd, pricing was at $10-12, 4 days ago. Now it's at $27. Tripled in value in four fucking days and I'm on the wrong side of it due to how long it takes to get USD into the market. I'ma stab a bitch.
At least I'm comforted in that I wasn't going to put all that much USD in (in comparison to income, would still buy some nice shit), so I could just triple that amount and it's only a relatively marginal extra sum of money.
Still gonna stab a bitch.

Yeah but any legitimate merchants would have to cease accepting it, and any law abiding resident of any such country would get out, thus severely reducing the overall economy and returning it to where it is now, an underground largely used for illegal purposes niche transaction aid.

You'll find those that already have a decent quantity of BC jumping for joy and those that wanted to get in a week ago (me) making the most frowny face possible without requiring botox to get back to a neutral expression.

Ha, I have had a 5850 since shortly after it came out, just for my gaming PC, which I don't use all that often. So I turned it on 3/4 days ago for mining, it's makes more value than the electricity it sucks down, and it would otherwise be sitting turned off, so why not put it to work.

Thanks for that detailed insightful commentary. I also appreciate you sharing the superior alternatives with us all, very helpful of you.

The orange and blue lines are by value (in BC on the left and USD on the right), not by individual orders. 
An across the board increase in offers to buy and sell at exactly the same price points would result in the scales on the sides changing to match (since the page dynamically adjusts). If there was an added sale offer of $10,000 at say $19/BC, then everything below that would stay the same, the line at $19 would get steeper, and everything above it would raise up by $10,000, but in the same proportions (as everything above $19 now takes $10,000 more before the market gets to that point). You can see that indicated by the temporary gray lines that appear next to the blue and orange lines that show the shifting offer volumes.
The steeper the sides the more stable the transaction price will be (as it will take a lot of transaction volume to work through before getting to a different price). A very shallow blue or yellow line means that only a small transaction can move the trade price point a lot in that direction.
These swings in trade price are indicated by the green line that runs down the center. A wild swing one direction or the other in a quick period of time doesn't necessarily indicate that a large value of trades were made at that time, simply that the offers were shallow and over a large variance of value.

Doesn't matter if they lost the BC at $1 a piece, had they still had them they would be worth far far far more now.
Those guys should should petition the developers to put in a feature that restores BC back to the sending address if it isn't claimed/received(?) in 6 months or a year.
@_date: 2011-06-08 22:56:58
No no no, don't mention the 'b' word, they will call you a naysayer and hold even faster. Must encourage that there is a true confidence panic, that the ones who know better are selling and you better join in or get screwed.

With all the feature enhancements being made to the client, would it not be reasonable to assume that at some point in time over 51% of clients would be updated to a version past the version that added in the additional 'restore lost moneys' code? Or does it not work that way, I've not delved into the technical back end at all basically.

What do you mean by 'you people'?!?
@_date: 2013-03-29 02:52:22
Wasn't a defense, just a basic explanation of how banks can introduce additional IOU notes into the money supply without debasing everything horribly - essentially the answer is to do it as the same rate or (in the US Federal Reserve's opinion) at a rate of slow inflation.
There's a lot of things wrong with wrong with fiat money, as well as things wrong with monetary systems based on commodities, issues with centrally managed currencies and issues with decentralized currencies. No one has a perfect system, and even if there was such a thing there would always still be winners and losers. It comes down to human nature more than anything.

Simmer down poncho.
I said nothing about his age, and the 'would have that much in 5 years of working' does imply I'm talking about around or just over $100k, just like you said. And there are quite a few of them. It's well within normal east/west coast US salary range for a multitude of occupations. That's not .01%ers we're talking about.
And do you think the bitcoin layabout doesn't have living expenses, or tax due on the proceeds when they finally sell?
The only point was that it's not as much as some would make it out to be, and very clearly NOT in yacht territory. That was it. But please, feel free to fly off the handle like a nutter.

Well maybe they should, loot drop, calculate the value, declare as income. Holding a item and you divest of it and the value went up, capital gains taxes on that cod piece. Mothafucka!

Because 'work' is people or machines moving things from high entropy to low entropy - converting raw ores and petroleum into refined metals and plastics and combining them into cars. Converting clay into bricks and trees into timber and rock into polished flooring and counter tops and assembling them into houses.
To do this you need to pay for the inputs, human labor, machinery, energy.
As a business you go to a bank and say, if you loan me X money I can pay for Y raw materials and Z labor and through this process convert them into something at least as valuable as X money which I can sell on the open market, and therefore I'll be able to pay you back.
The bank can take the produced item and raw materials as collateral in case of non-repayment. This somewhat covers them in case they don't get paid back money itself.
Once the item, say a car, is produced a consumer of that item will either buy it outright (perhaps from the money they made as a laborer building that house) or they would get a loan from a bank, stating loan me X money, as I make Y in wages and can pay you back over time, the bank holding the newly produced valuable item as collateral should they not get paid back money itself.
So the TL;DR: version is, we has humans make things more valuable through converting them from one thing that has little worth (a pile of clay, a hunk of ore) into something valuable, a car, a computer, a train. We are creating value through the work we do and the energy we expend. The fractional reserve banking system allows banks to create money out of thin air (fiat 'money' is just a marker of debt, an IOU note basically) and give it to people as a loan with the expectation that what they use the money to create will be worth the amount of money they are being lent and can pay it back.

Yep. It might seem a lot (for basically free/lottery winnings), but there's a lot of people working jobs out there that make 6 figures, and would have that much in 5 years of working (versus 2 of bitcoin holdings), and they most definitely do not have yachts.
