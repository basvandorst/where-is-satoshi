Mexico has this and it is god damned terrible. Now the equivalent of the IRS tracks every financial transaction in the country. It's the Book of Revelation in-real-life. They get to revoke your keys and now you're shit out of luck to live or operate.

Kind of what they have now. The ability to print ones and zeroes from thin air.

We will never really know, now will we? ;)

It's a battle worth fighting for.
