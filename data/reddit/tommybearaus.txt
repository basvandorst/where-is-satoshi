I have no idea.  The second factor was a mobile phone code.  I'm absolutely devastated by this :(

*sigh*  I wish I had known that before...

Can you do that.  Is the origin IP useful?

I had it all a CEX and then I transferred it to block chain, for god-sake.  It transferred it like that :( 
I had initially used it to purchase GHS at CEX right?  Then the value of btc was going up and I decided to cash out my GHS and move it to my wallet and hold it.  Man am I ever regretting that now.  So depressed.

I think I'm going to do that/  What's best for OSX.  There are a bunch of Open Source tools that search for malware.  How would I know if there is a key logger installed?

Thanks for that.  I've checked and can't see anything :(

Yeah now that I think about it, there was a time when it wasn't 2FA :(  That could be it. *sigh*

How do paper wallets work?

I actually flattened my OSX install and updated it to the latest, just to get ready for transferring these funds from CEX.  Then two hours after I transferred it to blockchain, someone initiated a transfer out of the wallet.

Thanks for your support.  I have removed the address.

What's a mixer?
@_date: 2013-11-20 07:42:41
That was actually pretty mean
