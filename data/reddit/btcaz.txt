The devs admit the code was born out of a scam, the project at the start was a sacm. The community got taken in, spent a load of time and money on it. Rather than leave it in the dirt to die, they wanted to protect the coins they accumulated at the start. They are fighting a losing battle because its a complete basket case. 
Peter Todd told them to move over to Bitcoin code. So where is this magical cryptonote code going? In the bin.
They just need to move on to doge or pot coin or something more meaningful.

CoinJoin on steroids - some new features being added look great for BTC

having used both money transfer services and various methods to purchase bitcoins, you have to do this evaluation by referencing the full end to end cost of both methods of moving fiat. 
With Bitcoin you have to take into account the process to buy them and then getting the bitcoins exchanged at the other end to fiat. For example, cash with localbitcoins or via a bitcoin ATM.
That is the only way you can show to ordinary people who only want to use Bitcoin for money transfer the full comparative costs.
With Bitcoin ATMs charging 5%-10% and localbitcoins charging similar amounts, at each end, bitcoin can be more costly. But could work out cheaper because there is no effective FX cost - the FX is where western union and the like make most of their money.
We need to work on this to reduce the costs of fiat to bitcoin transactions. 
The response might be - its so much cheaper to use Coinbase or some other similar service. Remember, most money transfers are conducted by people without access to bank accounts and possibly not even a computer.
The response - why bother with fiat at all, everyone should just use bitcoin. well those who use money transfers are poor and live day to day with fiat in poor areas. Once you get local market traders and local shops in the back streets of mexico to accept bitcoin, then you would have a point.

Look out for upward price movements on all the energy efficient GPU mineable coins as people switch away; but especially the coins that also want to be ASIC resistant.

If you don't sign it, Satoshi would get a $20m tax bill. 
He would need to dump a load of coins on to the market to raise the money. 
That would cause the value of your bitcoins to fall.
Sign the f'king thing.

Great for bitcoin?
Coinbase just shut down accounts of people that had moved their coins from a gambling site.
Coinbase knows more about bitcoin users movements than the NSA, GCHQ and the owners of those coins.

you will be able to pay for everything with bitcoin.

1. Monero is a clone of another coin. The devs couldn't even create their own coin.
2. Monero is, according to their devs, alpha grade and not to be trusted at the moment until they do some more work on it. They can't do it themselves ofcourse - they are paying hired help (see below).
3. Monero doesn't hide your IP address. You are still open to tracing.
4. Monero has a problem with the size of its block chain. It can't serve anything more than a small town. The only moon it will ever see is a reflection in a puddle of murky rainwater.
5. Monero is under attack from its clone cousins. They are currently forked and don't know how to fix the fork without doing a veri-rollback
6. Peter Todd called the code - 'crap'. They hired him to help them, so they paid him to tell them and the world its crap.
7. It was born out of a scam, and there are lots of holes in the code to help the scams along. The Monero devs haven't got a clue what's lurking in their code.
8. There are pockets of secret miners that mine at 10x to 100x everyone else. The original miners for crytonote where less efficient on purpose. The Monero devs are aware of all this, yet they keep quiet about it as much as possible. Someone was recently boasting they mined more than 50 or 60% of the network for a month or two without anyone noticing - not because of developing some ASICs, no - they found the secret flaws left in the code on purpose.
9. Some rich dude got scammed into supporting the coin, now he spends his days trolling the Poloneix trollbox to try and encourage kids to support his investment so he doesn't look bad.
If you value your privacy or freedom from a metal cage, don't for fucks sakes go anywhere near this shit.
PS. 
It is also considered a scam - The monero scam thread

Bitcoin full nodes are being addressed by a new incentive scheme from an alt.
Altcoins suffer if bitcoin gets a bad reputation because its security infrastructure is questioned. 
Nice idea. Not sure it will get traction.

For those that have a need to apply for a regulatory licence - this site only takes BTC

They have been shutting down accounts for money transfer firms for years. 
Its because they carry the liability for fines for their customers actions. 
Rather than engage in trying to work with customers, its cheaper and less of a risk to just shut down the activity.
