Actually they are doing more than that, they are arbitrarily using funds from accounts that were not affected by the hack to compensate those that were. I don't believe they have any legal basis on which they can do that, and I for one will be soliciting for a class action suit.

It's a calculated/estimated risk, you can't use margin on bitcoin stored in personal wallets! Margin is the only reason anyone would use a service like Bitfinex. 
By a lucky (I hope) quirk of fate, the recent price drop had triggered a liquidation of my margin position at bitfinex just before the theft, so i was at all fiat.

I wasn't arguing to take them into administration, I was simply pointing out that for those in USD this amounts to theft. BTC holders were who got robbed, there is absolutely no legal basis on which they can take other peoples segregated funds to compensate BTC holders for their losses!
To clarify thinking on this, if say my local branch of Barclays bank got robbed at gunpoint, cleaned out. Do you think it would be acceptable for Barclays to say: 'Well, let's ease the pain of town account holders, we will just take £50 out of everyone else's account around the country'??? Would they f*ck get away with that! So why does Bitfinex think they can do that?

You are vastly understating the profit to be made with this kind of manipulation. With CFD's giving 20 x leverage, well the sky's the limit  if you have sufficient capital to be able to move the market. It's only natural since there is no meaningful over site/regulation of bitcoin markets yet.

I didn't say it's a bad thing, I simply highlighted that if a person with sufficient capital to move the market by dumping or buying large quantities of coins in a short period of time, can take advantage of leverage to make vast profits.
I do think it would be a good idea if the leveraged product providers used a bitcoin price based on the average of say the top 10 exchanges, rather than a specific exchange. This would make the cost of manipulating the market significantly higher, and would therefore happen less often!

You have to compare instruments of the same risk profile. Right now you could (for example) park your BTC in the exchange margin funds and get about 25% with the only real risk being an exchange collapse.

I don't disagree, as I mentioned in another response I agree that BTC HODL'rs will find this the perfect place to park their collective BTC now. However the argument collapses once BTC price curve flattens and the interchange between BTC and fiat becomes fast and efficient. Then value will go where it can earn the highest return. My argument was fairly simple, when that situation arises Lightning fee's must compete with other investments or we will see a dramatic falloff in channel capital capacity.

What is their business model? ie if it's zero fees how will they make profit? profitable=stable/less risky.

You make an interesting argument for why the **infrastructure costs** of running a channel are low, but ignore the cost of capital. 
My argument however was purely around the lost opportunity cost of putting the capital required to run a channel that could have gone to higher yielding use in an almost equally safe instrument.

@_date: 2018-01-01 23:58:08
Well you have described one of the issues, but not why it can't be solved.
I believe we could use a model similar to the options market where the 'price of an option' is based on it's recent history of price volatility. So the option price effectively is a statement on probability of a price being achieved ('Black-scholes model). A similar model could, I would think, be applied to the submitted transaction fee in relation to recent history of transaction fee's in determining whether a transaction has a given probability of being applied to the blockchain and therefore worth keeping in the mempool.
That being said the above does not tackle the high fee snowball issue you describe. I shall give that some more thought...

Yes I pay for email and google, just not with cash. It's called personal data, and it has value. I cannot accept that something that will eventually be expected to tie up billions in capital will be provided out of the goodness of peoples hearts. I believe fee's will be an approximation of money market rates / the velocity of transactions + cost of on chain settlement. This will still be cheap compared to any other provider but not insignificant.

But in this case supply (capital) has many other places it can go. Fee's have to be sufficient to attract the capital by competing with the alternative resting places for that capital. So as a low risk use of capital, it's main competitors are money markets and state treasuries.

A reasonable argument, but my 'fees on transactions' were implicit in the term "the velocity of transactions", so the faster the coins flow the more fees, I get that. I do however accept the argument that hodlers will use this as their safe holding spot, I can totally see that happening. (Myself included), but that's only true whilst it's not easy to convert BTC to fiat and hold it elsewhere and while bitcoin is seen as an investment in itself.

@_date: 2019-07-16 18:47:30
A very weak argument: 
1. You know full well there is a huge lag on gold prices going up and mining supply rising to meet that demand due to the time it takes to bring mines online.
2. If supply exceeds demand price goes up, it does not 'cause' volatility. Trying to imply that BTC will always be volatile is absurd, the larger the market cap the more demand  needed to move the price. Eventually it will behave like USD and other major currencies in terms of daily movement.
3. You are casually ignoring layer 2 and 3 payment solutions such as lightning. Whilst I concede pricing is difficult right now because of price volatility, as btc's market cap increases and volatility reduces, pricing in btc as the international currency is likely to become the norm (IMHO).

I'm afraid you are discounting the margin market. Most manipulation is done not to just move the price in one direction but to move it quickly so that those dumb enough to try and maintain highly leveraged positions on bitcoin get liquidated out quickly, thus amplifying the move. It's a simple matter for a whale to take a short highly leveraged position on one exchange, then dump enough coins on another to trigger the liquidations, collecting a massive profit on their leverage account. Once done just rinse and repeat in the other direction to buy back your coins. This matches the price behaviour we are seeing, so I think the answer to the OP's question is yes it is.

Well in once sense the core developers are right, if more people would adopt segwit now we would not have congestion. The problem is that some of the high transaction rate organisations we need to adopt segwit have turned out to be bad actors or influenced by bad actors, with interests in maintaining a high fee market in bitcoin. I'm talking about Coinbase, Blockchain.info , Bitpay and of course our friendly Chinese miners to name but a few. 
The core developers could side step all of this now with a 2MB increase, kicking the can far enough down the road to allow Lightning to kick in big time. But they are too invested in their current position and won't budge.
Since core developers budging seems unlikely, we must vest our hopes in sufficient segwit adoption by the community to give lightning some breathing space.

Arbitrage works slows at the moment because of the limitations in moving fiat balances between exchange accounts. Bitfinex in particular cannot take USD wires, so is in danger of falling behind on price as we saw yesterday with some exchanges hitting 20k and Bitfinex barely touching 16k.

That all sounds very logical, until you realise they dumped segwit as well. The only reason to dump that was so Jihan could continue gaining an unfair advantage with asicboost technology.
Though I don't completely disagree with you, if core developers had been a little more flexible and dropped a 2MB increase in, we wouldn't be having this discussion and BCH wouldn't exist. I think they have been a little taken aback and naive about why the likes of Coinbase, Blockchain and Bitpay  would drag their heels implementing Segwit, knowing it would cause these exact delays in Bitcoin transactions.

 *Yet if you mention how it needs $10billion/year in new investment per year to support a $15k coin with 1800 coins being produced daily by miners you get downvoted here.*
** $10 billion is minor in the scheme of world finance, it does however ensure the security of the network, so a positive IMHO**
 *If you even dare talk about the 6 transaction/second limit you get ridiculed with something about how very soon most of the world will be using the Lightning Network.*
 ** Well that's because the 6 transaction/second limit is currently fine if bitcoin is a settlement layer, and yes it can scale. Bitcoin as cash use case clearly needs a lightning type solution to function, and I believe that will come. Even if bitcoin never succeeded as cash, it has already shown it can be a store of value/settlement layer, the cash case is all gravy from here**
 *If you try showcasing how the lightning network is very likely to eventually become a hub and spoke model with the hubs being analogous to and likely owned by banks you get ignored/downvoted.* 
** I don't accept that, most people who understand lightning fully understand that lightning will probably operate as hub and spoke. However the huge difference to bank/paypal type centralisation is that anyone with capital can join without needing permission from anyone else. This will increase competition massively and drive down fee's to the marginal cost of that capital **
 *If you ever question the fact that total inflows to crypto currencies have been estimated to be $6-10 billion which means there are over $400billion in unrealized gains that need additional capital to pay out you get ignored.*
** You must know something about the amount of HODL'rs that I don't**
 *If you mention the $3billion annual cost in electricity alone (ignoring equipment, land, personnel) and the environmental damage it does to keep up the network few people care.*
**How much energy time and material do you think goes into gold and silver exploration/mining each year? The energy price is worth paying to ensure the security of the asset**
*I want a decentralized peer to peer payment system to exist, I want it to succeed but blindly believing in the hype is probably going to end in disaster. This subreddit is getting pretty religious and unwilling to hear any negative opinions. Not everyone, I'm sure I'll get a few reasonable responses, but in mass I'm just seeing blind faith that the price will go up forever hitting $100k, $1million, with no explanations other than "0.01% of the world use bitcoin" or "Not every millionaire can own a single bitcoin" rather than reasoned analysis, which is exactly what the clueless talking heads on TV are doing when they say it's a bubble.*
** Don't disagree there are a lot of people investing with close to zero knowledge, but there is also a lot of smart money from hedge funds coming in. What the split is I do not know, I would hope it leans towards the hedge funds betting on belief in the digital gold model, I fear it may be dumb public speculation, which could lead to a massive correction**

Lol bitcoin has not even started as a currency yet. Those that understand how these things work can clearly see it needs to become a store of value in the trillions before it can become an effective currency. The high fee thing is good and correct side effect of being a high store of value. The fee problem gets solved, and low value transactions in general at millions of transactions per second becomes useful when lightning network swings into gear. THEN we will have the makings of a true currency.
We are so early on the adoption curve now, claiming "bitcoin is finished as a currency" is just plain nonsense.

Unless their are really great mechanisms for that, then the money velocity will potentially be too low to justify funding the channel.

I agree with the offchain assement, however people keep holding Visa up as the valid comparison, when in fact bitcoin can  and will enfranchise all 6.5billion.

Your labouring under the belief that people would want to 'cash out', do people 'cash out' their US dollars now that you can get a billion zimbabwe dollars for one US dollar? no. So the logical extension is if bitcoin becomes worth $1million USD their probably won't be another store of value like it thats worth 'cashing out' to, certainly not the USD.

Depends on whether you believe most transactions will happen on or off chain. I personally believe that the bitcoin blockchain will rapidly become too expensive for anything other than the largest settlement layers and we will see lots of sidechains with different functions (and of course lightning). No matter how much they squeeze out of transaction rates, transaction demand will outpace bitcoin capacity forcing it to trend towards offchain/sidechains.

I would normally agree, but that assumption works on the basis that most people are holding a range of assets, so they get a margin call in their stock and sell some of their gold to cover etc. 
However, we might be in a slightly different world with bitcoin, I don't believe it's being generally used as parts of portfolios yet so should have considerably more resistance to a falling tide than say gold. Especially if people notice that resistance and flock to it as save haven.
Of course the 'tide' is really the pension funds and how they react. So their decision to take a portion of bitcoin into their portfolio for safety will be impacted by progress in the regulatory regime. Right now they can only do that via Gemini, but I seriously doubt any have.

"But there is no blockchain without Bitcoin "
You could not be more wrong, there can be any number of blockchains. However, the value/usefullness of them is determined by how difficult they are to corrupt which is directly proportional (for public blockchains) to the cost of mining that chain . However, private/semi-private blockchains can and will spring up in the future with no dependance on bitcoin (or even the size of mining pool). The likes of the inter bank SWIFT network is an obvious candidate for such a semi private chain and would not require bitcoin to succeed. Today, the SWIFT network requires members to trust other members and accept the transactions they present as true. A very far from satisfactory state of affairs given the lack of international banking oversite, hence lots of banks are excluded from the network directly. A semi private blockchain would solve that problem.
@_date: 2015-06-16 00:18:02
You are correct, but missed the point I was making, which was that the normal S curve has an exponential growth phase, and we have no idea at all if we are in it, near it, or indeed how steep or long that phase will be. So trying to predict future transaction rates without that basic info will have a high degree of error.

That won't fly in the UK, tax authorities have strict criteria for deciding if someone is an employee or an external consultant (called the IR35 rules), these involve tests like do you set your own hours?, do you report to anyone? Does the company provide any facilities? If you pay someone as a consultant via invoice and the tax office decides they are not, then you as the employer are liable (retrospectively) for all tax and national insurance that should have been paid.
This gives you a good flavour of rules for UK firms employing people outside the UK: 
It basically comes down to the question "do you have a corporate presence in the US?" if so you need to be witholding tax for US tax authorities, if not, you are free to pay them gross in bitcoins or steel washers if you fancy, the individuals must then account for their tax themselves.

They are the variations on bitcoin that people have created since, some have technical advantages over bitcoins, others are just me to copies. None have the market value of bitcoin, in fact bitcoins nearest competitor litecoin is only worth 1% of bitcoins market cap. So I would advise give the alt coins a wide birth, it is very unlikely that any of them will ever successfully compete against bitcoin (With possible exception of Etherium).

That is a very flawed question in that you do not define success. Bitcoin can both succeed and fail at the same time depending on your choice of criteria.
I suspect the main criteria that your test of 'success/failure' could be applied to are:
* i)   As a store of value.
* ii)  As a medium of value exchange.
* iii)  As practical day to day money.
* iv)  As an investment.
* v)  As a world reserve currency.
* vi) As a libertarian tool to free us from the industrial/war complex.
* vii) As a tool to provide the worlds unbanked with equality.
I doubt bitcoin will succeed in all of these, but it's certainly arguable that it already has succeeded in at least some of these categories.

It's not personal, paypal (like any webscale company) cannot use real people to make decisions on all of these types of exceptions, it simply costs to much. Instead, they utilise computer programs to seek out the exceptions and automatically freeze or completely ban an account. 
The problem is, that the rights and wrongs of your case will almost certainly never be heard, it's extremely difficult to get a real person at paypal to make a decision that overrules their ban bots. I myself had a burgeoning SSD business ruined because of these over cautious bots, and will never do business with ebay/paypal again as a result, not out of hate but out of the simple fact YOU CANNOT RELY ON DOING BUSINESS CONTINUOUSLY WITH EBAY/PAYPAL, ONE DAY THEY WILL FREEZE YOU!

You clearly don't understand the mining algorithm. The bitcoin mining difficulty increases BECAUSE there is more processing power, not out of some desperate need for more processing power. The bitcoin network could be running just as happily on a couple of hundred peoples pc's, it would just use a much lower 'difficulty factor'. So to be clear, processing power is not an never will be the limiting factor on the size of the bitcoin network.

Wasn't Woodstock the last time anyone said "right on"?
You are correct on the synthetic (mutable) gold, it's already been done, just isn't practical in scale yet. In fact it was russian nuclear scientists noticed it years ago as a side effect of a certain nuclear reaction, noticed that the lead bricks surrounding the reactor had temporarily (because the isotope degrades) turned to gold.
My point in the factoid (as I think another user also mentioned) was that gold is not rare, most of the gold ever mined came from one meteorite collision. This tells us there are lots of meteors in our solar system which are basically pure gold, how long before someone identifies and goes after one given the rise of private space exploration? Of course that would be pointless if bitcoin does what we all hope it will!
And just to be argumentative for the sake of it :) "Rules of mathematics are not mutable" really? I would argue all rules are based on current understanding, which changes over time. So for example do the rules of  Euclidean geometry hold when the triangle traverses one or more of the 10 dimensions posited by string theory? I doubt it.

* How many people now understand that governments printing money is the equivalent of stealing value from existing money holders?
* How many people have been turned away by those very banks that stole our money?
For each of these people, when they finally hear about bitcoin it is a eureka moment! I know it hit me like a sledge hammer when the possibilities sank in.

Your assumption that a manipulator would have to 'buy back' their bitcoins after forcing a margin call driven crash is incorrect.

Margin is a powerful profit amplifying tool if you don't get too greedy with it. I'm margined at 1.5:1 which is probably the max anyone should go with this volatility unless you want to get raped by the manipulators. Those exchanges that offer as high as 8:1 are not acting in the interests of their clients as you are almost certain to lose everything if you try and leverage bitcoin at 8:1
Also, if you can take put options on bitcoins, or sell call options, you can margin much higher and limit the downside risk.

* If your libertarian, this definately sticks it to 'the man'!
* It's technically better than fiat currency (faster, lower cost, and anyone [worlds unbanked, people with bad credit ratings, bankrupties] can have an account!)
* It's potential for developing nations means supporting bitcoin by using it is giving direct support to the future of undeveloped nations!
* No government will ever be able to steal our wealth again by printing almost unlimited paper money.
* Supports micro tipping so you really don't need Mastercard/Visa taking the first $1 so you can tip 10c
* Makes media distribution more open/lower cost because you can buy with micro payments.
* Levels the global financial playing field a lot, equal opportunity for all. No more American domination of world politics with the petro dollar/IMF!

It very much matters, especially if one party refutes the contract in court even though it's been executed automatically. A classic example of which is when a contract is executed with unfair terms because one party was in a dominant position at the time of execution (small startup v monster inc).

As Russia learned today, interest rates only work if their is reasonable confidence that a default won't happen. Nobody in their right mind would bet 100 rubles in the hope of getting 117 back or possibly 5!
So the market reaction to todays desperate interest hike was increased disbelief that a default will be avoided. Simples, but hey grand master chess strategist Putin knew all that before today. I'd love to play him at chequers sometime...

Consider this, JP Morgan, Citi, Barclays, et al are sitting on hundreds of billions of dollars. The banks clearly consider bitcoin a threat. Banks are also probably the most experienced in hedging against risks/threats. What if one or more of them decides to hedge by buying a significant percentage of the outstanding bitcoin?
Anyone who thinks that is not a possibility doesn't understand investment bank mentality or the ocean of free cash they are sitting on at the moment.

Grey old men that clearly do not understand the subject. They laid out their ignorance like a grocery list:
* "The dollar is a digital currency and bitcoin is a digital currency" Do you know the difference between digital and crypto guys? kind of significant to your point.
* "There is nothing you can do with it (bitcoin) except give it to somebody else", 60,000 retailers would disagree!
* "Gold will never die, gold is real money" Bought a Latte with gold recently have you?
* "bitcoin has the most fanatics", you have to be a fanatic to see the value of bitcoin? Or did you mean “therefore it must be bad”? Wonder how many “gold fanatics/bugs” are out there?
* "We don't know how bitcoin will behave in a down market",  So you are advocating waiting 15-20 years before testing your entry into a new investment or monetary vehicle? Good luck catching value.
* "bitcoin advocates express it's value in dollars", just  crazy!! Should we compare it to the current world reserve currency (like every other currency does) or perhaps your personal favourite gold? 
* "There are over 400 other digital currencies, the supply of digital currencies seems to be infinite", ignoring the 'digital' slip you imply that bitcoin has less value because there are competitors. Is the USD less valuable because there are 197 other fiat currencies out there?
* "Absent a unitive exchange there is no value in bitcoin", so we can't discover value without a unitive exchange???  Did you know the absolute value check of a currency is the cost of a sex with a prostitute? Studies have shown that it’s been the most consistent measure across currencies and across time since at least early roman times!
* "Ultimately it's going to collapse, it's like Tulip mania", really? on what fricken planet is the development of a unique peer to peer trustless based method of value exchange like a centralised ponzi scheme on a temporarily scarce commodity?
* “What powered bitcoin in 2013 was the fact that was the year that gold did poorly”  Gold production  2013 was 139 million oz ($150 billion roughly) and that’s just NEW gold,  old gold is 171,000 tonnes!! What percentage of your gold market powered bitcoin to the giddy heights of $8 billion USD?? No using your sliderules!
* “Hopefully we will return to a gold backed currency system” care to explain how the hell that’s even theoretically possible given the massive print runs of fiat, the gold imbalances between countries and most of all the total distrust of USA as a holder? Do you remember why Nixon got rid of it?
The list goes on and on…

If there are central banks out there that 'get it', then they must also surely acknowledge the fact one day bitcoin may become the dominant world currency. Since their job is to manage monetary stability for their respective nations, does it not make absolute sense that to manage the risk that bitcoin represents, countries central banks would be obligated to stockpile some bitcoin as a hedge??

The benefit is really simple, it removes friction of currency conversion to the asset class especially for larger investors. This is a very very big deal for bitcoin as it stands at the moment. It will however become largely irrelevant as bitcoin goes mainstream except for people who just don't get bitcoin, but want to participate in a more traditional way.
If I was in investor wanting to expose (say) $50k to bitcoin price, it would be a far far simpler deal to just buy 50k of ETF than try to aquire 50k of actual bitcoin AS OF RIGHT NOW! So this opens up the market to those higher value players who won't need to truly understand bitcoin to get investment exposure to it.

* Phase 2a. Adoption by retailers who convert most or all of their bitcoin sales to fiat immediately. This has the effect of taking bitcoin out of use and putting downward pressure on the price. The price is only balanced upward ppressure from new investors. 2a is where we are now!
* Phase 2b. As mass retailer adoption (see paypal today) encourages and drives mass public adoption, demand for bitcoin increases dramatically increasing the upward pressure on price, this has a multiplier effect as investors start to view bitcoin as an appreciating investment again. Downward pressure still comes from retailers converting straight to fiat for price stability though, so this will be rapid price increase but not vertical increase.
* Phase 2c. The middleman gets dropped altogether, people start getting paid in bitcoin and buying everything in bitcoin, retailers only convert back to fiat to pay their taxes. People have projected that at this point bitcoin will be worth $50k to $1 million, but comparison with USD is only meaningful in todays terms, by then USD will be like toilet paper.
So my friend, patience is an attribute that will serve you well with bitcoin as an investment, stick with us.

There will still be options open to them to regulate, such as the 'green address' concept. ie like bank accounts, only bitcoin addresses that are declared/identified are legal to use. Of course that doesnt stop people using undeclared ones, but most people do want to live their lives within the law, and thats what counts.

That depends on your definition of weird. Volume is usually the best indicator, nearly 8000 on bitfinex in a 45min window where a few hundred would be 'normal' volume for that exchange. Now it's debatable whether margin liquidations caused the volume or were caused BY the volume, but if it was a regulated exchange, the regulators WOULD be looking at that kind of activity with great suspicion. 
As for the other exchanges mirroring the price, well thats to be expected, arbitrage dealing on bitcoin is now pretty advanced, no single exchange gets too far from the pack before it kicks in to balance things up.

Frank, thanks for responding, i'm not trying to be hostile to you guys, so apologies if I come over that way. I have however been a little frustrated during my first trade via you guys, and it's basically been over stuff that just needs to be highlighted better. For example I would never have placed a trade on a friday evening (in a volatile BTC market) if i'd known it probably would not get executed till monday morning. Similarly the lack of transparency on pricing (because of the timing issue) is a niggle, I could for example have got a better price at localbitcoin.com but had no way of knowing that at order time.

Been lots of discussion on that, I suggested it needed to be dynamic according to how well we are tracking moores law for general purpose computing (The theory being that an average home system should be able to handle a full node). But that doesn't seem to have been taken up on.

They should treat the problem the way modern relational databases work, dynamically, ie look at their own growth stats to determine increases in allocation size.

@_date: 2016-01-21 10:55:07
No that's not what happening. There are two distinct limits that you are confusing. The first is the rate at which new coins are issued, that is on a  fixed unchangeable algorithm and will eventually result in a maximum of 21 million coins being issue (in about 150 years). The second limit is more a software design limit known as the 'block size'. Because a new block is created about every 10 minutes, then the block size determines how many transactions the network can store in those 10 minutes. The current 1MB block size is rapidly reaching the point where it is not big enough to contain the amount of transactions being posted every 10 minutes (Because transaction volume is increasing). So the debate and delay has largely been around the different ways of increasing the transaction throughput, some of which have been to increase the block size. There are some parties with vested interests in keeping the block size as is which would create a competitive market for transactions to get into the available 1MB. The way that would work is by people bidding with higher transaction fee's, and the miners effectively only processing the highest payers!  
Now most sane people realise that would be shooting bitcoin in the foot as large amounts of transactions would never get processed. So the current 'split' in the community is between two relatively sane options, 1. To implement an immediate 2MB increase via a hard fork (Called bitcoin classic) and 2. To implement another technique first called Segregated witness which has a host of other benefits, and then implement a block size increase further down the road.
I've been following the arguments closely and I still cannot make up my mind (and i'm pretty technical!). The bitcoin classic approach runs the risk of alienating the absolutely crucial core team, but the core team have been very slow in getting to where we need to get, so could do with some clarity; which competition brings!

Because the bitcoin market and Bitfinex in particular are unregulated, people use the lack of regulation to manipulate the price in a way that would be illegal in any other market.

Well there in lays the problem, bitcoin in isolation cannot be all things to all people. And i'm pretty certain that even Satoshi would not have foreseen the myriad of possibilities that come with having a secure block chain.
Given the premise that bitcoin can't function as a high end store of value and a low end mega high volume 'electronic cash' at the same time (The required design changes are mutually exclusive), someone has to select which model to follow.
Given also that we know other forms of 'electronic cash' with those desired properties can be built on top of the 'store of value' bitcoin (And i'm thinking sidechains and lightning), it makes perfect sense to layer those products on top of the bitcoin blockchain locking the values together.
I really dont understand people who have such a problem with the layered approach. A good analogy would be trying to cram email and video streams into the TCP/IP protocol. It makes far more sense to keep the base layer simple and stable, and build on top of that.

That would only happen if core decided to give up and go home, they are mature people and unlikely to do that. When classic goes live, core will more than likely backport the 2MB increase and pick up the next release with segwit, which would with 100% certainty be adopted by the economic majority.
The net result will be the economic majority will have got what they wanted (2MB now) and core team will have had a community shot across the bows that important issues need to be dealt with in a democratic and timely manner.

It's several sessions, about 3 hours long, but well worth it, my take from it is:
* Regulation  USA is 3 years from being anywhere on federal reulation.
* R3 group definately not using bitcoin blockchain at this point, though open to it with future developments.
* UK government mentioned several times as being way ahead in terms of creating a bitcoin freindly environment.
* Very few people  in that room (especially from the regulators)  seemed to understand the bitcoin/Bitcoin distinction.
* R3 guy seems real smart, but gave away that they are a very long way from doing anything of any substance because they don't even know which regulators to talk to!
* Barry Silbert seemed very anti bitcoin to me, talked about it not being useful unless it gets to $4500!
* USA is screwed in terms of hoping to lead the way, way too fractured a regulatory scheme.
* R3 expects most bitcoin ventures to "run out of runway" because they can't last the three years its going to take to get regulatory clarity.
* It was a talking shop, absolutely nothing of any substance achieved.

There are going to be a lot of innocent parties who believed the Peter Schiff's and Jamie Dimons of this world and avoided bitcoin until it's too late, and watched their fiat savings evaporate in front of their eyes. The kindest thing we can do is have earnest discussions with those we care about now and pursuade them of the truth before it's too late. At the very least pursuade them to hedge their bets and buy a little bitcoin.

The most rational discussion i've seen on that was the guy that posted earlier today on the patterns of past spikes, how high and where they settled to four months later. Based on that work you probably want to be cashing out at about $4k and buying back in at about $1600 where it should settle.
Then again, nobody really knows, it's all 'educated guesswork' at best.

It has always seemed to me the most incredible coincidence that bitcoin/Bitcoin came along just as the global debt crisis was reaching it's inevitable conclusion with the collapse of the USD.

I do not see it as beyond the realms of possibility that bitcoin was engineered to replace the dollar, or more specifically the US debt.

Whilst you make a valid point about the difference between bitcoin and ethereum, you have completely missed my point. This isn't a discussion about which one is most likely to have a significant negative event, this is a discussion about how it's handled when it does eventually happen (and it will, again!).
I was trying to make the simple point that preparing for the unexpected could be improved. Vitalik did not reach for a checklist or charter when stuff got real, they started developing contingencies on the spot, and that is when serious mistakes/breaches of trust, call them what you will, can (and did) happen.  
Pretending that there is no human factor (aka core dev)  that could adversely affect the whole network if another serious bitcoin incident occurs is just being idealistic, i'd rather be realistic and safe.

I didn't even come close to saying that. There is no high level solution that cannot be broken down into good readable and understandable code. I was simply supporting the concept of being willing to challenge solutions that  appear too complex or 'over engineered' as Rick put it.
I'm not even saying that applies to Segwit, I don't think it does, but that's mainly because I've not seen a better solution. Segwit in it's current form without a doubt will reduce the amount of people in the world who can understand/review bitcoin code, and that is not a good thing.

That statement from Mastercard is an out and out lie these days. Cards work in some geographic locations and not others, on some machines and not others (like cash machines and petrol/gas pumps). It is the VENDOR that decides which card varieties they will accept, they do not just blanket accept every Mastercard.
Bottom line the fungability of fiat loaded on a mastercard or visa card is in severe doubt these days.

Depends what you think the word 'regulate' means!  It doesn't have to mean knowing everything about everyone, it could be as simple as being able to link trades that are large enough to move the market to people, so that suspicious patterns can be picked up and acted on.
Bit like the 'Stockwatch' program in US.
Besides, it's not like wishful thinking, it's a raging certainty! The likes of Gemini exchange are already covered by those sort of rules. When people come to realise that regulation is not ALL bad, the bitfinex's of this world will shrink to niche players at best.
Right now, today, too large  a portion of world bitcoin/usd trading is on Bitfinex, therefore it gets abused.

Hi Luke, i understand fully the concept of needing the consensus, but the same is also true over at Ethereum, and look what's actually happened, screaming over IRC to shut down the exchanges and worse the exchanges actually considering it!
 
The reality is if you guy's put a hard fork out there for consideration, it's going to be considered by the community.  So there has to be at least some rules or guidance as to when that would be the right and or  acceptable thing to do. 
I see no harm (in fact it could only increase confidence) in publicly stated sets of ways you would or would not react to almost inevitable events (Like some exchange going bust).
We already know there are circumstance when a hard fork is required (2013), so lets just make the human side of this equation more rule driven!

Discuss without offering any logic or reasoning! Why don't we just roll the dice?
My belief is it is being systematically taken down, every weakness (like bitfinex) exploited to the full. As for the why I don't know, could simply be profiting off shorts or perhaps some big player wants to load up at a lower price, it matters not, the only thing we can be sure of is the price is going down against all logic.

Really dumb assertion.
1. They wouldn't be dumping if they were losing money doing it! Dead easy to make more money back than you lose, just by taking leveraged short positions elsewhere before you do the dump! This mechanism may also be getting used to launder dirty coins.
2. I,we, the bitcoin community are being attacked in many ways when the price is attacked, it lowers the market cap of bitcoin and thus lowers it's usefulness for bigger tasks (such as settlement rails). But on a simpler level, anyone holding bitcoin on margin is literally having the value of their account raped by these criminals.

@_date: 2016-06-25 22:20:21
If you want to wait 110 years (Thats when last coin gets mined), then be our guest.
The decreasing availability of newly mined coins is only one minor part of what drives bitcoin price. You need to think about things like:
* How useful is it as money?
* How useful is it as a store of value?
* How many people are likely to want some bitcoin in the future?
* What percentage of the curreent money,gold, bond and derivatives market will end up in bitcoin?
These and lots of other key factors, it's a big big subject to learn, but the more you learn, the more you will realise that $650/coin is nothing. Bitcoin could easily put 2 or 3 zero's on that price over coming years.
So to answer your question directly, It's very far from being too late to enter bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-06-16 19:09:06
No you wouldn't, but gold is not practical to use as money whilst bitcoin is.
I'm in UK, so if I take a job in Euro's, pay my taxes and keep the remaining Euro's , if the value of those Euro's goes up hugely against the pound, I don't get taxed on it! I can buy goods with it etc etc, it's exactly the same tax argument for bitcoin.

As we move into an age of bearer token ownership of assets, it's only a matter of time before gold becomes one of those assets, traded and used as money. I anticipate a digital goldcoin will arise (Whether that's as a color coin style token or more likely a sidechain). Key to it's acceptance will be the credibility and audit ability of the physical holding organisation.

Whilst I agree with much of what you say, you talk in absolute terms about things that are very grey in practice.  So you don't "HAVE" to build contracts using counterparty, it just happens to be one of the first 'higher level' protocols available on the bitcoin network. Same way we can for example now send a web page over SMTP (email)!
Other higher level protocols will come and go, the best will achieve critical mass and become universally accepted standard. Right now, Bitcoin is the only viable secure 'transport layer' to use your terminology. And IMHO has achieved enough critical mass to guarantee it's path to ubiquity.
@_date: 2016-06-14 01:36:41
yeah ok, we can all apply experience of past gains/losses etc etc but bitcoin is not directly comparable to any other asset class we have had experience of; so any 'rationalization' is at best an approximation of behaviors we have seen in other assets, and therefore at best flawed as an argument either for or against.
And btw, you do realize that you are arguing you can rationalize the irrational?

With respect, you are missing mine.

ok, so you seem to be in this camp of "Ethereum is technically broken by design, but bitcoin is so great, it's not going to break ever" If that were true I would agree, the charter would be pointless.
I had not tried to derive any of the charter rules, because I have not put any time in to thinking about how bitcoin could fail, but my earlier 'examples' were the sort of thing you could say in advance you definitely **wouldn't** do. And the only purpose they serve is to crystalise thinking in a crisis, to make sure core dev don't react out of panic in a bad way to something that has already had some pre-thought put into it.
So lets play war games! 
* **Scenario:** Tensions have been rising with China and the West over human rights abuses, China  turns off the great firewall, so now we having a split brain in the bitcoin world. Western miners validating western transactions, China validating it's transactions. Lets assume  it's been off for several days now. We know China has the longer chain, and western miners will overwrite western transactions as soon as China comes back online. Confidence in western bitcoin transactions has plumetted with everyone, nobody is using it anymore, businesses are failing, what do 'we' the team do?

@_date: 2016-06-14 05:15:54
I come from a 30+ year coding background, and I can tell you for a fact he has a point about simplicity. Keeping in mind absolute rock solid reliability has to be the most important consideration around any changes to bitcoin, then it's perfectly valid to challenge any proposed complex solution providing you have a better simpler one to challenge it with. Unfortunately he does not!
Back in the early 80's we used to make the most junior programmer we could find do code walkthroughs of any new code, and if he couldn't understand it, it was deemed too complex or not properly coded. KISS It will do bitcoin a complete disservice if code get's in there that only the brightest of the bright can comprehend!
@_date: 2016-06-11 14:31:24
This is the new norm, as long was we want the security and irreversability of bitcoin, then scammers will milk it for everything they can. No amount of legislation or law enforcement is going to stop this from becoming the evil twin of a free world utilising crypocurrencies.
And to be honest, if you ever worked in CC fraud prevention, your hair would stand on end at what fraudsters are openly allowed to get away with because 'its not cost effective to pursue'! Far easier to pass the costs on to dumb fee payers! I don't think the world has seen the tiniest fraction of the fraud that is to come when bitcoin becomes ubiquotous.
@_date: 2016-06-18 13:44:59
Whilst I totally agree with the KISS / layer 2 principle. Segwit is not a layer 2 candidate, what it achieves can only done in the base code.
I do however think we need a stronger code review process, from what i'm hearing from dev's they have received hardly any 'acks' signifying positive review (probably because it's so complex that hardly anyone understands it!).
The other thing is layering is not full protection, The DAO issue was in layer 2 (the actual contract) not the Eth scripting language itself (Although some have argued the scripting language made the bug possible, so is itself bugged).
@_date: 2016-06-11 21:43:35

Whilst I applaud sincerely the goals of the project, I think in it's current form it has a couple of major flaws:
* a) It doesn't have an economic model, so cannot be relied on to stay present.
* b) "If you are interested in being a trusted connection..." from your website, did you miss the lecture on the value of the bitcoin network coming from being completely trustless? The project is introducing an externally controllable point of failure that is a major risk to bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-06-19 14:58:48
I know very well how it's supposed to work! Perhaps charter was too loaded a word to use, and checklist would have made more practical sense. This discussion started from the following question: "How do we ensure that the human mistakes that are being made by the Ethereum core dev team during their current crisis, are not possible with our core dev team?" 
You have rightly stated the principles that are well known, and would never be accepted by miners. But it's always good when looking for weaknesses to examine boundary conditions. 
Do we know for a fact that miners would never accept any proposal from core dev that affects fungibility? (As is happening in Ethereum now)
Do we know for a fact that miners would not accept a bribe from hacker(s) to maintain fungibility?  (As is allegedly happening in Ethereum now)
The list goes on and on, it's just a thought experiment, not a "bitcoin uber alt" mentaility.

Also, given it's not yet a regulated market, I would not put it past the big guys trying to get in to actually sell short big time initially to trigger a margin cascade which they then buy into.

Not really, those sudden selling spurts are usually manipulators trying to force out people who have gotten too optimistic and gone full margin. Sometimes just a small amount of coins can cause a margin selling cascade, which they then buy their coins back cheap with. Usually levered off a futures play also.
@_date: 2016-06-15 02:47:14
They are ok but: 
*  They have a problem with price manipulation,  lots of flash crashes over the years wiping margin players out completely. It's been raised with their management several times, and each time they come back and say 'the trades all looked ok to us' which is short for "not in our interests to fix". 
**So be warned if you use their site, do not go all out on margin, you will be rekt sooner or later.**
*  Trading Ethereum, their liquidity is very low, better off at Poloniex for that.
*  Manage your margin rates manually, their automatic algorithms for allocating margin are **not** on a 'lowest offer first' basis. I've found my margin can be allocated at 10-15x current best offer (normally 0.06-0.07%/day) without any warning! so unless you track it closely, your margin interest can get horrendous.

Where the flaws are and who to blame does diddly squat to help predict future bug frequency. Computers have always had additional physical protection layers such as firewalls BECAUSE they are so buggy. But this is a brave new crypto world, every surface is out there naked in public to be prodded and poked by people with a huge financial incentive to break in. Bitcoin has successfully defended itself by keeping the attack surface very very small. Bigger surfaces will eventually be developed that are secure, ether just got too confident too quickly. A lot of people think it's fundamentally flawed for security, and that it would be better implemented as a far more secure finite state engine.

Saying Ethereum is not broken is like saying, "that man slit his throat with  a cut throat razor. The razor was perfectly safe, it was the way he used it that slit his throat! "
The two arguments are inseparable. Ether is dangerous because it has a turing complete engine, that gives it a massive attack service  and the ability for bad/faulty code to be written into contracts.
I'm not saying it won't mature and become significantly safer. But for right now, IMHO, the rush to smart contracts has not allowed the maturation that such an engine needs before it's ready to safely handle the very big bucks!

Yeah Bitfinex has been the primary cause of instability in the bitcoin market since it took over from mt.gox. Every time there is a bear raid, management inspects the trades, goes "they look ok to us" and looks the other way! If they had been operating in a regulated environment they would be in jail now!
What happens on Bitfinex is nothing short (no pun intended) of blatant bear raiding of margin positions.

Think of it this way, if Britain leaves that only leaves two significant net contributers to the EU project (Germany and France), how long before one of them decides it doesn't want to pay for the rest of Europe? What happens when the Euro (as a currency) fails? 28 nation states all looking for cheap ways to transfer value around.

Not likely, if bitcoin replace all m0 money, it could hit $500,000 /bitcoin  but we all know that's not going to be allowed to happen.
Having said that, bitcoin is relevant in so many other ways, not just as a global currency, but as a store of value (for example), so if you start adding a slice of the gold market, a slice of the stock market, a slice of the bond market, a slice of people's savings accounts etc etc You could easily be looking at $5million/coin. The math tell's us this.
After all, there will only ever be at best btc 0.003 for each person on the planet (probably 0.001 by time all issued 110 years), so bitcoin at $1000000 would equal $3000 for every person on the planet, sounds about right!

People will be looking for a train wreck, but the reality is it would be slow motion at best. The markets might do a knee-jerk reaction, but actual leaving the EU is a 2 year minimum process. Everyone involved will be shooting for maximum stability, so my take is it will bring the Euro's future into question, and we might see some capital flight from the Euro, but since most of that capital is free moving (unlike china), I doubt btc will be the beneficiary.

The problem is you have to look at the number of net contributers. 
UK was one of the big four, the others are Germany,France and Italy.
So the remaining three have to fill the gap of UK net contribution, they might just pull that off, but if one more big boy leaves, neither germany or Italy would be able to sustain the costs. It would take a massive 'defunding' of other countries to balance the budget, that would lead to further withdrawals, and you get a cascade...
I think far more likely is a french withdrawal, followed by a full renegotiation of what the EU should be, ie a common market, not a political or fiscal union. Maybe even with UK and France back in!

The problem is that the average Jo simply won't care that it's not really a public blockchain.
If for example the US government issued crypto dollars that were effectively barer bonds for fiat dollars in the same way fiat dollars used to be barer bonds for gold, then the average   Jo would just accept that it was issued by the government and accept and trust it! It won't matter to them if it's really a secret banking cartel, just like it doesnt matter now. This IMHO is the single biggest threat to the long term viability of bitcoin. What lets me sleep at night is the knowledge that whether it's crypto, paper or just bit's in bank account computers, they will still keep overprinting it, thus ensuring the dollars ultimate demise.

The arbitrage bots have now become very complex and competitive. There are some simplistic ones out there (python and perl) that will do three way (triangular) arbitrage, but you wont find one that can trade profitably.
Most of the exchanges are believed to be running their own bots to ensure they mop up arbitrage opportunities (because they can run faster closer to or on the exchange server) so not much room for us ordinary folks these days i'm afraid!

The way I look on it is to ask myself this question: Are the factors that have caused this investment in bitcoin going to grow or diminish in coming weeks/months?
Factors such as:
* Amount of population opening new bitcoin wallets for speculation.
* Government acceptance like Japan
* Institutional acceptance like CME 
* Mainstream institutional investment like hedge funds.
When I look at these factors I can't help feeling that we are barely over the start line, and the mountains peak is so far over the horizon we can't even see it yet.

You can't wipe away exchange responsibilities at a stroke like that.  Yes people should accept responsibility for the risk in their positions, but they make those decisions based on perceived risk of a given exchange. And in this case the perceived risk &lt;&gt; real risk, because Bitfinex.com are not managing trades and cascade risks the way they publicly claim they are!
There is a good reason the whale chose Bitfinex.com to make the trade, it would not have been allowed at bitstamp for example.

Surely their business plan boils down to three simple questions:
* a) Can they develop/manufacture the most profitable (lowest power/hash) mining chips in the world?
* b) If so can they develop a profit share model with consumers to incentivise use of them in their home devices? (Maybe indirectly with consumer device manufacturers)
* c) If they can't then can they simply go it alone and use these super efficient chips to mine? 
I think if they do not incentivise consumers to use devices with their embedded chips, then people will catch on pretty damned quick to the power implications and avoid using such devices.

With respect your windows xp analogy is very wrong. Those people that want to run XP can do so providing they run it on equipment that was compatible at the time. The cost of change often exceeds the benefits, and in fairness to Microsoft they have always supported very old PC's with their newer operating systems. Apples case is the other way around, they bring out new OS versions that are deliberately non backward compatible with existing app versions, forcing users into hardware upgrades to use the latest version of the o/s and app (which is often identical functionality to the old one).

Yeah except that in this instance QE went well beyond exchanging liquidity with member banks and more into direct purchasing of corporate bonds! $4.5 trillion in total! This has had the knock on effect of companies buying back their own shares with this 'cheap money' and creating an artificial stock market bubble of epic scale!
This can only end very dramatically with the mother of all stock market crashes!
Edit: Since US stock market is about 17 trillion, you could argue it's heading for a 26% crash! but will probably go further as once you take out confidence, and people on margin get wiped out &gt; 50% drop is achievable.

I could not disagree with you more, like fiat the bitcoin 'value' at this stage comes from consensus belief it has value. Gold is not worth $1300 an ounce for it's utility in jewellery and electronics, it's simply a belief. 
Once we have some longevity/stability to that consensus that bitcoin is a secure and reliable store of value, then it's use as money will simply evolve out of that.

I think we re looking at this the wrong way around. There is no doubt in my mind that bitcoin will become the superior money that will negate a lot of reasons for using a bank. In trying to understand if this means the end of banks we have to understand what other 'Value Add' they bring to the consumer table:
a) Loans.
b) Morgages.
c) Access to the Visa/Mastercard system.
d) Cash points.
The only one I see bitcoin having difficulty fully replacing (or making obsolete) is Mortgages. And that might be enough! If banks (for example) require consumers to have held an account with them for a long time before they will even consider a morgage, then consumers will bow to that pressure!

Wow, just got this from coinfloor support:
"- withdrawals - to maximize security, bitcoin withdrawals happen up to three times a day during working hours. The total time of processing will not exceed 24 hours on business days. If your withdrawal request is made during the weekend it will be added to the next withdrawal batch."
So a withdrawal made at 5:01pm on a Friday may not be executed until 9:01 am the following Tuesday!
Security is not a valid excuse here. When you make a withdrawal from coinfloor.com it HAS to be to your pre-registered withdrawal address, you cannot change it for a given withdrawal, so how is security improved by only processing withdrawals 3 times per day?

Bank's are not the problem per se, it's the system thats the problem.
If you have a construct like a company and put people in charge of it, then say your sole obective is to make as much profit as possible, within the law, and you bonus them on exactly how much they make, then you end up with corporations testing the bounderies of the law every which way they can in search of profit.
The UK tried to address the problem when they added statutory duties of care to the public for company Directors (In other words, shareholders/profits should not be their only consideration in exercising their role). It's a good start, and has reigned in a lot of bad behaviour over here, but there is a lot more could be done along those lines globally IMHO.

I'm not against expanding the capacity of base layer, it will certainly need it at some point. The question about what fee level would be acceptable really begs another question. What should be the minimum value of transaction the base layer should be trying to support? Answer that and the fee's answer follows logically, and the required blocksize to keep those fees steady follows from that.

No it's not a regulatory hurdle it's a personal liability hurdle for directors. And if you think personal liability does not make directors think twice about their actions, look at how many close up their business's rather than risk being personally liable for trading 'whilst insolvent'. Directors personal liability has real teeth, and it's making a difference (over here at least), and I say that out of personal experience!

Not strictly true, i've advocated several times a dynamic block size/cap based on actual transaction rates in recent history, so a bit like the difficulty factor.
But i've seen no intelligent discussion on this by the devs. The XT solution is without doubt clumbsy and likely to diverge in the future from real transaction rates because it's guessing future transaction rates rather than measuring past rates.

Countries that have suffered massive inflation tend to end up with pricing in thousands, tens of thousands of orig unit. But bitcoin will be heading the other way, increasing in value.

Not likely, you would be wiped out with just a 20% drop, most margin systems make an enforced sell well before that, probably near 10%.

They don't, all transactions are final. You could of course engage with the retailer to persuade them to send you a separate refund transaction, but that is entirely of their choosing, ie bitcoin itself has no refund, recall or voiding mechanisms.
That being said there are mechanisms to require multiple signatories to a transaction, this amongst other things allows escrow services to function, providing that bridge for high value transactions with untrusted third parties.

Well to support the logic how about:
1. Fiat currency has had the shortest lifespan so far of all forms of money.
2. Fiat currency is currently being completely undermined by the neo economic policies of central banks in the form of QE and money creation policies.
3. There are currently only two real candidates for an alternative to fiat, namely gold (a step backwards) or crypto currencies of which bitcoin is the head and shoulders leader (A step forward).
So is it really such a stretch for you if you look at the whole march of history  to see an age coming soon of a trans national currency based on bitcoin?

I've been watcing this debate for some time now, and as a system designer/technical architect (of 30 years) I feel very uncomfortable with the binary solutions being offered. Forcing people to choose a camp. 
Clearly the intent of Satoshi is to allow market forces to drive the development, and the core team should be supporting that ethos.
How do you let market forces drive this then? I would suggest consideration be given to a new technical solution based on  **dynamic block size** where the users/miners select the blocksize they wish to use (Within reasonable anti-DDOS limits), so if the market demands faster speeds, new or existing miners can jump in with bigger block sizes to fill that gap as and when needed. 
If this has been technically considered and I missed it, I apologise. But surely a technical comprise of this nature can be found!

You really missed my argument, that there should be a name at **every 100th divisor** of a bitcoin, this gives us a natural progression path as the value grows over the years.
1000's is too much of a leap.
* 1btc = 1 btc
* 1/100 btc = dog
* 1/10000 btc = cat
* 1/1000000 btc = bit
* 1/100000000 = satoshi

Britain will lose some business, but since it's mainly financial services that will migrate, I (and many others) would argue this is a good thing as it will force a re-balancing of the top heavy (with financial services) UK industry. I actually believe we will be far more nimble and flexible, and therefore able to take better and quicker advantage of global business opportunities than where we are at the moment, strapped to the bow of a sinking titanic.
As for scotland leaving UK, well that would only stand the slightest chance of happening if a clear majority of scots had voted to remain in EU.

You don't need to convince the governments to take a decision to use it as world reserve currency, the markets will make those choices. That's why gold is still so popular even though not a single country officially uses it as currency (or money).

Yeah there are strategies for taking advantage of these manipulations, one is to place hidden buy/sell orders (depending what direction you think it's gonna be manipulated) at the limit of the normal manipulation size during the thinnest trading periods, this makes it more expensive for the whale to get the move they were looking for and allows you to buy cheap(er) or sell high(er) than you would otherwise have managed.

The existence of leveraged derivatives on an unregulated bitcoin market means that anyone with enough coins can legally make large amounts of coin by manipulating the market, as expressed with these spikes and drops.  Game theory says it will happen.
The giveaway of manipulation is always that it happens during the periods of thinnest liquidity when the manipulator can get the biggest bang for his bitcoin.

You have to consider the life cycle, bitcoin cannot become electronic cash overnight, it has first to become a store of value that is stable enough to use as a currency, it is not there yet by probably a factor of 10 in market cap terms. In the mean time, people are finding innovative ways to use it as cash whilst avoiding the volatility, but real mainstream cash adoption will come when we make the next 10x leap IMHO.
Tipping point will be when people are willing to price their goods and services in BTC without needing to reprice them every day or every hour.
The great Irony is that when we reach this point, fiat currencies will start to be perceived and compared to BTC as being too volatile, and will themselves start to diminish in use due to volatility. BTC will become the bedrock against which everything else becomes measured.
@_date: 2019-01-05 22:06:59

I did not claim the protocol has changed (Although it has, hint read the BIP's), of much more significance are factors such as it's continuously improving usage in terms of value and transactions, global legislative recognition, longevity (a 10 year old crypto that has never been hacked is a lot more trusted than a one week old crypto), utility built on top of the base protocol, Lightning being one stellar example of several, and last but not least public awareness. And still we have only begun to scratch the surface of it's potential.

I found the Visa Debit card they provide randomly fails (with ample balance) about  1 in 6 times, and that it's a complete waste of time trying to get answers from Xapo support on why and how to prevent it happening again.
I've also found their 'debit card' frequently doesn't register as a debit card on merchant systems, so you end up paying the Visa credit card transaction fee of about £2.50
They also quietly steal your UK pounds by applying a conversion rate well below the current spot BTC/GBP on each transaction. I just checked and they are offering 3,450.11 when the current spot is 3638.92 that's a 5% theft!

Um no, your math is way off there.

They don't really give a flying f*ck about protecting joe public from ICO scams, what terrifies them is the degree to which bitcoin is being used to move value out of local currency to offshore assets (be that foreign fiat or property). These people are of course not hodlers they just use bitcoin as a vehicle to offshore their wealth. What is REALLY interesting is the possibility of china effectively stopping the majority of that offshoring would remove the offshore bitcoin selling pressure it generates, so in theory (well my theory anyway) a china exchange ban should lead to a significant BTC/(USD|EUR) price increase.

It depends on who the counter party to the trade is, which is dependant on the trader. In Europe for example where CFD's are more prevalent than futures, the broker is often the counter party and hedges that position exposure with an offset trade elsewhere.

I don't disagree with you, I have an intense hate of banks also, but that doesn't really change my argument. If you see the money banks 'waste' trying to secure their information systems, then you start to see the potential for blockchain tech there. Banks are driven by profit motive just like any business, so a  fintech that can reduce costs would be attractive. 
Also forcing banks to use blockchain technology to introduce a true peerless money transfer network (bitcoin or proprietary) would address many government regulator concerns about banks that are too big to fail and counter party risk. Going back to my SWIFT analogy many smaller banks are not directly on the swift network they have their own bank accounts with bigger (correspondent) banks that ARE on the swift network, so SWIFT in practice is really heirarchical with  all the risks that brings with it (third party trust etc).
@_date: 2017-10-17 18:14:14
"These cards transfer dollars" um and the rest, Visa/Mastercard is a multi-currency system linked to the banking system. There is no practical reason why over the course of time we would not see banks offering bitcoin accounts with Visa/Mastercard providing the appropriate card services denominated in bitcoin.
"The government creates a new currency pegged to bitcoin" 
I didn't even come close to saying that.
Good old Nixon unpegged from gold not as a logical choice but as the only choice since you (USA) couldn't get a hold of enough gold to match your money printing aspirations.
Yeah ok, bitcoin is deflationary, and nobody really knows how we would adjust to that as a society. We have spent generations building up debt for future generations, if there is a way to step off the roundabout then some scuffed kneecaps would be a price worth paying.
Bitcoin is more volatile that USD now. But it's all relative, as value flows to bitcoin it's volatility has and will continue to drop and vice versa for the USD. There will come a day (IMHO) where bitcoin is seen as THE stable currency.

Do you understand how banks work? You think they pass money around in real time?? A bank account is just a set of numbers in a computer made up by the bank, the net of the transactions between these virtual accounts is what settlement does, typically on a daily basis. DAILY not 10 mins.
The real (truly international) gold standard only lasted 50 years, it was unsustainable because US had 75% of the worlds gold at the end of world war II (No profiting from war there!)
I'm not arguing the deflationary aspect (though you clearly want to), dunno how that will work but I suspect we will adapt.
Re- stability ah so you are arguing bitcoin is better off in a 2 year bear market because that was more stable?? Whilst I agree stability will come with actually usage, it will also come with speculation simply because the market cap (if there really is such a thing with a store of value)  will get too large to be moved by individual players, additionally a derivatives market will develop which assists stability also.

No reason why the network could not represent real currency, that's exactly what the current swift network does.

@_date: 2017-10-16 23:34:38
No disagreement on whether bitcoin is ready for that. However I hold a different view on what would transpire. It is my belief that the banking system would of necessity adopt btc as a currency, and all the current high volume functions (Visa/Mastercard) would continue but based on bitcoin. They would after all be adding value bridging the time gap of 10 mins, and indeed we already have btc based Visa/Mastercards!  However over time the newer high volume (layered protocol) solutions to bitcoin such as lightning and sidechains would eat their lunch (again). 
As a side note, I believe that as a USD takes hold, merchants will be looking for a more stable currency to price their goods in. If USD goes down there are going to be no stable fiats out there, so the logical choice would be btc.
Nobody 'knows' what will happen, all we can do is try and play it out in our head and guess based on our own experiences. So if  you think you 'know' you are wrong.

You could call it speculating, but game theory says if a system can be 'gamed' it will be. Right now with the absence of controlling forces (regulators) to prevent that gaming, it's a reasonable assumption that it's happening. 
I simply pointed out one current and obvious mechanism to achieve the goal of gaming the system,  you don't need to be a "major player" to do it, but the more capital you have access to the easier.

You are assuming all the value of bitcoin comes from those that are speculating in it as apposed to it's utility. There may be at least some element of truth to that today, but we are definitely on the right growth path for utility (assuming nya crashes and burns), so the proportion of value in BTC price that comes from speculation will eventually tail off to give us [hopefully] a soft landing.

I've argued that very point several times, and always get shouted down here.

I'm sorry but I have to disagree, my argument did not state 'centralised' (closed &lt;&gt; centralised) the example I gave was banks and the current SWIFT network, members of which are linked by nothing more than qualifying criteria. This creates a massive distributed network of 15,000 banking organisations (compared to 20 bitcoin mining pools!), which, if operating a blockchain would also have a very high resistance to 51% attack and would require massive collusion between most world banks to attack their own network?? So Yes, the ledger IS immutable in this scenario and security DOES still come from proof of work, that POW just happens to be by the same (loose) group of organisations generating the transactions.

You are making a massive false assumption, just because the market cap would be 7 trillion does not mean that 7 trillion dollars needs to move into bitcoin.
It's best understood if we look at extremes. Supposing every bitcoin holder in the world refused to sell at any price, but one agreed to sell his one bitcoin at $300,000, then only 300,000 would have gone into the bitcoin economy but the market cap would be 7 trillion. The two concepts are entirely disconnected.

Just because the current largest blockchain is what hosts Bitcoin transactions does not mean that new blockchains will not be created and used for whole new purposes including banking. Indeed the blockchain used does not even have to be mineable by the public, the banks could for example agree amongst themselves that to be a banking member you must contribute x hash power to a private banking blockchain. This then enables them to utilise all the benefits of provable/irreversible transactions whilst still being a closed community of businesses. The SWIFT network would be an excellent candidate for this. My point is blockchains can and will appear for completely different purposes to bitcoin, and do NOT require public support and do NOT have to incorporate a mining reward system directly to be tenable.
@_date: 2015-09-16 00:50:48
Exactly,  even a one bank one vote type transaction / block approval scheme could work if the community was diverse enough (like the SWIFT bank members).
The real question in my mind is, what happens if they steam roller ahead and generate a chain to represent fiat holdings/bank accounts? The need to transact could force us all to accept their new blockchain as a 'improved online banking' service, regardless of how inferior to bitcoin it is.
@_date: 2015-09-24 11:24:41

1. What makes you think banks trust each other? Do you really think Citi Bank trusts First National bank of Iran? (for example) SWIFT is a push only network because the banks don't trust each other unlike the way they force citizens to trust them and accept pull transactions.  
2. A Blockchain approach levels the playing field, no more heirarchy of banks (SWIFT transfers can involve up to 4 banks) blockchain would be peer to peer.
3. No more heirarchy of banks reduces too big to fail risks for this public to bail out!
4. "You and many others like you have heard the 'Blockchain great, Bitcoin meh' meme so often that you believe it, but you haven't spent enough time considering what that means or if it makes sense." If anyone is patronising/pontificating it sounds like you are. I'm actually a 30+ year database designer and fully understand the pro's and con's of relational/distributed/heiarchical and blockchain methodologies.
5. As I said earlier, SWIFT is just an example of a system that could be improved with a  closed blockchain implementation. Anywhere where there is a large group of organisations that do not (or cannot) trust each other, with a need to transact, then there is potential for a blockchain implementation seperate from bitcoin. Ensuring there is enough hash power to make the network secure is a secondary consideration with lots of potential solutions. 
6. I doubt there is ANYONE out there more positive on bitcoin that me,  l luv it to bits. But that doesn't mean I have to bury my head in the sand and pretend blockchain tech has no other applications or that every alternative is somehow a threat to bitcoin!

Same way most bank ledgers do, physical money is a tiny portion of the overall money supply. Or did you imagine the SWIFT network was a vacuum tube system with real dollars wizzing along in cannisters? :)
The banks just exchange these 'messages' and calculate a netting off transfer of real money at regular intervals. In the case of gold, this can involve something as simple as changing the ownership label on the same gold in say fort knox (which actually when you think about it, is the same process as bitcoin).

That's a brilliant and very pertinent point well made. How do you put a value on something like TCP/IP? I guess the easiest way would be to ask the question, 'what would it cost if we lost it?'. For TCP/IP the cost in lost/collapsed  businesses,higher administration costs, etc would run to trillions. But if we lost say SMTP for email, life would go on, a new protocol would quickly replace it.

lol how naieve. I would bet that this is a straight forward derivative manipulation. Someone takes a massively leveraged short derivative position at Broker A then forces a selloff by selling a large block of BTC at Broker B in a timeframe that will move the market. The leveraged short gains far more than the btc losses from the overly fast sale, once they have cashed them out, reverse the options to longs and buy back the BTC. Rinse and repeat, always execute when trading is thinnest at weekends or after US is closed before China opens.

Playing devils advocate here, you are ignoring how business decisions are really made. It's not going to be a question of 'Can we ask the public to trust us with this private network?' It will be a case of, a) Can we do something we do now cheaper than before? b) Will customers use it?
c) Will it improve profit?
Since the majority of people don't have a clue about the freedom or other more esoteric issues of bitcoin, i'm guessing lots of bank crypto projects are ticking the standard business boxes right now.

What worries me is how disconnected the Bitfinex exchange is from the rest of the market because of the dollar wire/banking issue. If this forced liquidation happens forcing the local bitcoin price significantly higher, this will be a completely artificial local price, which must eventually return to market normality (presumably when they get banking working again). I guess what i'm saying is if the price pops up at bitfinex due to these transient conditions it may well be worth while selling up and waiting for normality to settle back in with the return of inter exchange arbitrage.

Whilst I don't disagree with you, there are certainly many things that states can do to slow,impede or even prevent the widespread adoption. The most obvious of which are the on ramps from fiat (Making exchanges illegal for example, or forcing banks to close the accounts of anyone accepting bitcoin in commerce). 
Now I totally get that one day those attack vectors will become irrelevant, but they can if they choose push that day a long long way out.

Not really, the idea is that the 'current position' should be beyond question. Historical proofs of why an address with no money in it now got that way may not always be required.

I have always subscribed to the theory that governments will sooner or later decide it's time to 'hedge their bets' with bitcoin, just in case it does become a global currency. If the Chinese do it first (Which I don't think is likely) we would never hear about it. Far more likely is UK, I've actually spoken to a government minister about it, and was very pleasantly surprised not only at how knowledgeable he was on the subject, but how open he was to that very possibility (Did my part to sow the seed as it were).

@_date: 2015-10-30 23:14:10
Erik, whilst I agree with you in the main, it strikes me there has been very little discussion about the mechanisms banks might use in building a block chain. And in particular if they recognise the absense of security in a permissioned ledger how they might overcome that problem.
As a thought experiment, what do you think would happen if the banks said ok, we spend $150 billion a year on intermediaries, how about if we replace them with our new ledger, make it public like bitcoin, tie the value of the token to 'say' the dollar, and distribute $15 billion a year in transaction fees to whoever wants to 'validate our transactions/mine'. Would that not attract at least a large portion of the current  mining capacity over to 'bank coin'??  
I'm just playing devils advocate here, but i'm sure there are potential solutions to what they want to achieve. And in particular the financial clout they carry in relation to bitcoins current market cap must make some of those solutions feasible if they get a move on! ie before bitcoin gets too big to supplant.

That's wasn't the assumption at all. It's straight math, with volatility as high as bitcoins then the odds of you getting burned if you use leverage increase in direct proportion. at 200:1 if you trade regularly or hold positions (long or short) for any significant time you are almost certain to get burned sooner or later. As someone who used to program futures trading systems for a large skandinavian bank, I do actually know what i'm talking about on this one!
Also I was so incredulous at that margin level I checked out the site. They flash headlines of 500:1 (pretty standard for FX) but the actual margin rate on bitcoin/USD cross is nearer to 20:1

I think you missed one of the central points to my 'what if' and that is the banks could easily have token of value linked directly to a currency, a sort of bearer bond scheme if you will (or in bitcoin terms a two way peg with fiat). So with instant and real tangible value up for grabs I would argue miners would come. 
I understand all the arguments of what makes bitcoin better, but in the real world the mining capacity would chase value, so (in my mind at least) it's just a case of how much are banks willing to pay to keep some measure of control.
Nigoyal, I understand your argument about not antogonizing intermediaries, but I really don't think the current intermediaries are in a position to do anything about it without shooting themselves in the foot and accelerating the whole process away from them.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:54:23
If USD goes hyper-inflationary then all trust in government issued fiat will be out the window. So what does that leave? you really think BTC would collapse with dollar? If so you really are missing the point of bitcoin.
Also, your premise that it would paint US as a huge target via bitcoin assumes no other country would have skin in the bitcoin game! Do you really think the US government could buy say 10's of billions USD of bitcoin and not push bitcoin well past the critical mass/ universal adoption point to being a global currency? Nothing happens in isolation, there would be an unbelievable price bubble (Which of course is meaningless when comparing the price to a collapsing US currency).

That was several months ago, had no call to use it again until two days ago, both websites I tried to use it at rejected it. I finally worked out that despite being clearly marked and marketed as a 'Visa Debit Card' you  have to indicate to payment gateways that it's a Visa CREDIT card in order to be accepted. For which they usually charge you an extra $4 fee! Total crap from start to end.

Putting it simply, the reputation of banks is wrecked, and they did it to themselves. There is massive pent up demand from the average population for friendly alternatives to the high fee, low service levels and basement trust levels of banks. Since they have effectively had state backed monopolies up till now, that has not been possible. Whether bitcoin is the answer remains to be seen (I believe it is) but you only have to look at other innovative solutions like m-pesa to realise that banks have not been servicing the majority of the world, and someone/something is going to step into that gap.

We are well beyond it mattering who Satoshi is.

Store of Value, Medium of Exchange, Unit of Account. I assume you lumped all of them under 'currency' which they really are not. The real value though is immutability, being able to stamp a record of something (A hash really) into an  immutable system for the first time opens up almost unlimited ways of forcing the truth to be recorded.
Imagine drug companies who's every output from every laboratory instrument is provable when submitting new drug applications. No more covering up results they didn't like!
Imagine land registries being uncorruptable by rogue governments, giving people in 3rd world countries (and some 1st world for that matter) secure property rights for the first time.

They are basically an internet bank offering SEPA transfers but the fund holding bank (Which is not Number26) is based in some small European country (I forget which), they are trying to treat Europe as one banking zone but the reality is a large portion of merchants reject  SEPA transfers that do not originate from the merchants country. This is technically illegal under EU law, but they do it all the same because there is no enforcement. 
It's a flawed business model until European banking really is universal.

My guess would be that those that wish to manipulate the markets are finding it harder to perform 'outsized transactions' on the more established markets. I think the last big move was put down to a bug in bitstamps api being exploited to avoid the anti manipulation algo's.

2. "little reason why one coin is better than another" are you shitting me? have you followed ANY of the arguments on what makes bitcoin superior? not least of which is the increased security and utility from being first mover with largest network effect.
3. We very obviously do NOT all need to agree that something digital has value, it only takes one person, like day one of bitcoin. Paper money (fiat) has no value, yet we accept it's 'value' and use it.
4. Well now you have gone from irrational arguments to conspiracy jibberish.

No, the dips come from idiots who have bought bitcoin on highly leveraged margin accounts and are forced in to liquidation when the price drops as little as 10%, these forced liquidation sales cause a  cascade forcing the pricing even lower and more forced liquidations. It's the sort of thing that in a regulated environment people would be going to jail for, but this is the brave new unregulated world, we should take steps to protect ourselves by not over leveraging. I would recommend no more than 2:1

ok it's really quite simple if you hold a lot of btc you:
* 1. Wait until trading is thinnest, this is usually before China opens after weekend. So Sunday evening US time.
* 2. Take a highly leveraged short CDF or option position, 200:1 is doable on exchange 'a'
* 3. Dump your coins on exchange 'b' (this should be an exchange like Bitfinex with lots of suckers that over leverage themselves on margin) , the dump has to be large enough to trigger some initial margin liquidations, and possibly start a cascade, I would guess 10% ish. You can estimate this looking at the order book.
* 4. When price has dropped enough from the cascade, close (or possibly reverse to long) your short CDF/put option at massive profit.
* 5. Buy your original coins back for less than (or possibly roughly same as) you sold them for, and trigger the price 'rebound' which you profit from again if you went long cdf/call option.
Highly profitable, and when done on multiple exchanges like that, almost impossible to prove as 'manipulation', because the exchanges are not joined up under a regulatory environment that would spot that kind of activity on say a normal stock exchange.
