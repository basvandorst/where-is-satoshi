I am trustworthy and will post follow ups and ask the charity to post something on the website to confirm they received the donations. This is an amazing place and they are having money issues. Anyone may contact them to ask questions and confirm my words are true. Here is my real name to show I am serious: Rachel Mamoni.

Many on the Bitcoin scene know me and my husband Hakim very well and will vouch for us. Hakim gives many speeches and is head of seedco.in

I just want to make something clear, I am really keen to see BTC adopted as currency. Me and my hubby are being paid in BTC for our work. So, I'm looking for like minded landlord who sees things my way. Of course, I could just change up my BTC for cash, but where would be the fun in that? ;-P I'm in this BTC movement for the long haul revolution against the bankers not for small term capital gains. And so, I ask again, if you know any like minded individuals who need tenants and would love a way to gain BTC, hook a girl up xxxxx

Well, if you only held BTC as a way to make profit, good luck to you. But personally I see BTC as a real alternative to money so I will never sell all of mine, I plan to see it develope so I can use it in shops and online to purchase. But I dig it that you made some solid funds for you. x

You should really be asking yourself "why the hell not?"
Fees are reduced dramatically, your btc may actually go up in value while you hold it. It's the future baby, be there or be square ;-P

I live in China and my husband has gotten a lot of interest for his Bitcoin talks. We have been buying up Bitcoins in Yuan and feel that China is the perfect place for Bitcoins to flourish due to the yuan being difficult to get out of the country at times. Makes sense for the Chinese business men/women to adopt Bitcoin. Also great for sending money to loved ones abroad. Chinese love anything IT that saves them cash ;-P
