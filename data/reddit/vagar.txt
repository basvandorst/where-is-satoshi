Because any person can create keys at will, just create a new receiving address in your wallet. It is a different public key (the number you give to people) and a different private key (stored in your wallet, needed to spend the BTC on this "account").  
Your wallet links all of your keys together. But it is (or should be) never connected to any of your personal information. Any human could have created the key.

$5m is a bit much.  
The USD monetary base is about 2.15 trillion. Divided by 21 million (maximum bitcoins) = ~100k.
  
So it's $100k/BTC, still much.

Because the rules don't apply when shit hits the fan. Most of reddit is just circlejerking about mundane things so it doesn't matter. In this sub though, there is money at stake for a lot of people. Exposing shitty or outright corrupt services is extremely important.

But once all 21 million btc are mined, we will have monetary deflation, right?

First thought: Did you consider naming it bitchan but decided against it because it sounded too much like bitching?
