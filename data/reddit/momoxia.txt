The side bar just gave me the option for bitcoin core which takes forever to sync. I apologize for assuming people would be willing to help and answer a newbie question. And thank you for being one of those toxic people that can't write 2 sentences to help or suggest something for a newbie and jump the criticism gun right away (totally okay with writing as much as it takes to dissuade newbies). 
Good day

Now you're actually pulling shit out of you rear end. Please post proof of your allegations.
I have been using bitcoins for 2-3 years now but I've never used a wallet besides blockchain and coinbase and therefore wanted an opinion of this community who have more experience on which wallet I can use that will give access to private keys as neither blockchain nor coinbase do that. Once again I apologize for a newbie question that you clearly have an issue with responding to like a decent human being but have no issues with bashing.
You may now go back to compensating for your tiny manhood by being a dick to everyone. Good day sir :)

If you say so :)

Isn't there a chance that since my internet is cut off and they can't update their used addresses, someone else could have the same address as me?

Thank you! Just finished downloading it.

Decided to go with Electrum but thank you! I'll download this one for my phone as well and keep a small amount in it! :)

They tend to go down everytime the BTC prices crash. I guess they're too busy buying up BTC and preventing their users from selling -.-

Even though most people don't want to admit it, EVERY OTHER ALT COIN relies on the BTC prices. If BTC goes up, they go up. If BTC goes down, they go down. Simple as that.

That's from back in May

Honestly I've seen this coin go from $4 to $100 to $1000 to $300 all in a matter of weeks.
BTC will always have highs and lows but believe me: In the long run it will always be at a higher value than it was before.

I like the idea of stability but like you said they need to be transparent about it.
Problem is that they can't be because people have the right to do as they please with THEIR money and if they came out and admitted that they do this, then people would just move to a different wallet service and that would be bad for their business.

Well that is slowly changing atm. Hopefully it'll go back to being only BTC in the very near future though.
