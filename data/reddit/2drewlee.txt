Stoked about this project. Great team / concept. 
@_date: 2016-08-12 00:37:12
We wrote about the philosophical reasons [yesterday]( 
tl;dr: We're open sourcing our wallet infrastructure so that other applications can tailor their applications on top of what we've built. Bcoin is an open source alternative to privatized solutions that reduces ecosystem system while allowing builders to retain control of wallets / funds.
Stay tuned for announcements including technical details and new products!

You're quoting buy rates. Check out the sell rates, they're 30-35% discounted on secondary markets. You'll also notice many gift card exchanges don't allow you to sell Amazon gift cards because they're difficult to transact (you redeem gift cards instead of deducting balance like pre-paid).

Hi Jez, we've made a lot of changes in the past year. Maybe you'll notice improvements, maybe you wont. Either way, would love to hear you and/or your wife's thoughts.

We know users who liquidate gift card credits account for over 85% of our transactions. We talk to mechanical turks everyday who thank us for providing liquidity. 
We also know people try to get free bitcoin by ordering and cancelling (OP's story). We know people try to double spend by claiming they never received their Amazon item. We know trophy wives who turn their husband's credit card allowance into bitcoin. And all kinds of other stuff I won't list here. 
We also work on [open source projects]( that benefit the whole ecosystem. But at the end of the day, we learn every day and work hard to protect our users and improve user experience.
@_date: 2016-08-24 22:46:52
Our mission is to build use cases for Bitcoin, and if you have a moral objection with that, I can live with it. Not sure why you think you know us...
The main issue is new earners who order on amazon then cancel right away hoping they get free bitcoin. 99% of the time, it's a nuisance for shoppers because escrow isn't released.
But every now and then, naive users release escrow prior to delivery which makes it worthwhile for these guys to automate the whole process to get free bitcoins. As mentioned above, we are aware of the issue, and we're working on preventing it.

I'm not certain what "new money" means. If it means newly printed / mined money, then no, we don't do anything like that. If it means new users with bitcoins, then yes.
The Bitcoin market has daily sell pressure from merchants and miners who convert to fiat. I heard it's roughly 20,000 BTC ($5M) per day. If you spend BTC with a normal merchant, you add to the sell pressure. If you spend BTC on purse.io, then your BTC is transferred to another user who may or may not sell it.
It's hard to say what the end recipient of BTC does. Regardless, it's not a guaranteed sell like most Coinbase/BitPay merchants.

I agree that there could be biases, but I don't think this experiment was designed to favor the status quo.
In experiment 1, 17k users were randomly defaulted to BTC, mBTC, or bits. Then I measured the ~10% that decided to change the unit.
In experiment 2, none of the respondents were Purse users. They signed up but did not use the service.

Welcome! Also, nice vape =)
@_date: 2015-05-08 17:46:30
I was looking for exactly this a few months ago for [Nakamoto's]( Since we weren't converting to fiat, it seemed silly to go through a middleman to process coins. We ended up at [CoinOfSale]( It's one of the most underrated bitcoin service out there. 0 fees, beautiful UI, and easy to use. Took a brief look at Mycelium Gear to compare. Gateway configurations has many useful features that CoinOfSale does not have (multiple exchange rates, order expiration time, select # of confirmations). 
Both should be marketed to every dispensary and cash-only merchants. It's the perfect solution: free and anonymous like cash, but it's way more secure. Steal the PoS and all you have is value of the tablet, and employees can't send coins.
But I'm concerned about the UI and complexity for non-Bitcoiners. The process of setting up an HD wallet and pasting over BIP32 pubkey is difficult enough. All the other settings should be defaulted and designed with the mom-and-pop merchant in mind. Make it so the community can sell for you to dispensary owners in 5 min.
Edit: more clarity to last paragraph.
@_date: 2015-05-08 19:24:32
CoinOfSale does support BIP32 - we are using the free version with Electrum now. Their marketing page is confusing and some basic merchant features are missing (transaction history, notes to transaction, etc.). Their premium features are unnecessary and expensive. I'm stoked that Mycelium is providing this service. Unlike Mycelium, I have no idea who runs CoinOfSale (based in Singapore).
I'm pointing out that I'd like to see more merchant features and fewer "bitcoin options". Keep the dispensary owner in mind and default a lot of settings. It needs to be as easy as Square to setup. If it is, this community will sell it to them.

**Lowest Possible Fees:** Traditional marketplaces have listing fees (3.5-45%) and additional transaction fees (3-5%). Happy to be corrected, but I'm not aware of any live marketplaces or payment processors that charge less than 1%.
**Eliminate the Middleman:** Existing marketplaces involve several middlemen that partake in the payment flow: processors (i.e. Stripe Connect), merchant acquirers (i.e. First Data), credit/debit card issuers (i.e. Capital One), among others. We eliminate these middlemen without compromising customer protection with Bitcoin escrow. Today, Purse is the most experienced Bitcoin escrow agent on the planet having transacted well over $7 million. Distributing that responsibility to others can be done, but it would careless and lead to a worse experience for users.
*side note:* The idea of a completely decentralized marketplace is interesting, and as Brian [pointed out]( there's proven demand that would benefit from a stable solution.

H&amp;R block has an [option]( to receive 10% extra on your tax return via Amazon gift cards. You can turn the gift cards into BTC via Purse. As a VIP member, it's possible to average 5-10% premium on the exchange maximizing your tax return.

Roger invested in Purse long before BCH or SegWit2x was a thing. He invested in almost every bitcoin company before 2015, and I'm glad that he did because Silicon Valley VCs weren't interested.
If you decide to start a bitcoin company, I'd highly recommend him. He's a passive investor at Purse which means he'll leave you alone even if you decide to spend most of your time developing open source projects for bitcoin (BTC). I've heard the same from every other company he's invested.
@_date: 2016-06-15 23:44:25
Purse charges a fee when orders are listed. If you're buying a $100 item and paying $90, Purse charges $1. All transactions are in BTC, and Purse has nothing to do with fiat. Pure closed-looped Bitcoin application.
Coinbase charges a fee when you convert Fiat to Bitcoin and vice versa. The fee depends on how you pay (ACH, debit, GDAX).

Welcome to Bitcoin! Here's 0.1 BTC to get you started. I suggest trying [CoPay]( It's open source and available on almost every platform.
Depending on where you are, [Coinbase]( is a great option to sell or buy more.
You should also link your Reddit account to [ChangeTip]( so you can collect these tips.

I have a lot of respect for Patrick Byrne and what he's done for Bitcoin / liberty. I'd be happy to be proven wrong here, but it's unlikely that Overstock or any other large retailer experienced a significant return on investment since accepting bitcoins. 
The hard / optimistic truth is that Bitcoin doesn't compete well as an option next to credit card checkout. Instead, Bitcoin offers opportunities for new business models including commerce through smart contracts like Purse. I think Patrick knows this too which would explain why he's focusing his time with Medici.

Opportunity cost in higher shopping cart abandonment.
Credit cards are so damn easy. Think Uber, not entering 16 digit + ccvs + address + etc. Using a stolen identity to pay for Uber rides sounds like a terrible idea.

If the masses realized it, Bitcoin would be far more valuable. Consumers accumulated $41B of unused gift cards [between 2008-2014]( Add loyalty points, airline miles, and other forms of stored value - consumers accumulate over $50B annually in the US.
Talk about low hanging fruit for Bitcoin... The inefficiency you describe is intrinsic: Bitcoin is more transportable than stored value. Purse unlocks value from otherwise illiquid assets using Bitcoin and escrows. Bitcoin brings efficiency to escrows, secure payments traditionally reserved for high value transactions.
Like Anthony, I'm looking forward to the day the masses realize Bitcoin's benefits over corporate issued currencies.
@_date: 2016-02-17 21:02:17
There are nuances specific to the gift card industry that account for the difference. Amazon does not specify the liabilities of redeemed gift cards (balances credited accounts), and it makes a difference because balances are much less liquid. Specific to our Earners, Turkers and Affiliates are paid out via balance credits instead of gift card codes.

Bitmain is NOT an investor. Further, there's nothing secret about this. The spec and code are open source and available for review.
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:11:31
There are $15B in Amazon gift cards (gc) floating around, and they're highly illiquid compared to Bitcoin. In fact, the  digital currency for remittance is Amazon gc, not Bitcoin. 
Purse connects users who have Bitcoin to users with gc to provide the best deals online. We try to abstract out the escrowed marketplace exchange as much as possible so it's usable for mainstream users. 
Amazon is a brilliant company that thought about the challenge with remitting money internationally to contractors before Satoshi. So they built a GC issuance API used by MTurk, Affiliates, and 3rd parties (Juno wallet, turbotax, dozens of others). And here's the amazing part - it's cheaper to issue their gc than it is to send fiat or Bitcoin. It costs $97 to issue $100.
The discount on Purse is market determined, and it's gone up as volume increased. As long as Bitcoin is below $1,000, my guess is the average discount will be over 20%. Beyond that, as long as one prefers $100 in bitcoins to $100 in gc stuck on one's Amazon account, there should still be a sizable discount.

I confronted him, but he doesn't stop. 
@_date: 2016-02-17 16:41:06
I'm sorry to hear that. If an item has multiple suppliers, Amazon's algorithm chooses based on price, supplier's rating, inventory, location, etc. We don't support used items, and every now and then, the algorithm doesn't choose the absolute lowest price.
The avg discount rate fluctuates, and it went down in December (more shopper supply), and it's gone way up this year (~24% avg discount). We're committed to providing the best deals online with Bitcoin and working on improving the marketplace experience everyday.

I like your order. Decentralised should be  otherwise, Bitcoin isn't unique.
I'd axe irrevocable. There are good reasons why credit cards are reversible. Think about all the pre-sales and scams - don't you miss being able to contact customer service to dispute charges?
Bitcoin transactions don't have to be irreversible. At [Purse]( every transaction is escrowed. If you purchase something and don't get what you asked for, funds are returned. Similarly, if an earner or merchant delivers item(s), she gets paid.
