I used to work as a bank teller (for a year), in Europe. Pretty much all the newest regulations and constraints were dictated by US banks - stuff like KYC, and constant suspicion about what our clients used their money for. Scary stuff.
The bank was okay with it though. Complying with KYC legal requirements meant tellers had the opportunity to upsell more stuff. Large withdrawal? Why not take an insured loan instead?
I'm okay with cashless, because of convenience - *my* convenience, not theirs. I don't want to trust banks. Give me BTC/Pebble over ApplePay/AppleWatch any day.

It's a loaded question, just like the poll is. The obvious answer is "yes". What we should strive for as a society is not "make the students pay a shit load of money for it and fuck them if they happen to be born in a poor environment".
Also, not having an option for groups to push silly stuff in classes just because they have influence (political power or money). Eg there is no place for Creationism in school books no matter what the market wants to sell.

On a more serious note: I'm not sure how it is in the US, but I believe homeless people here (France) can get such paperwork done thanks to shelters, for free.

I'd make a killing on the potato market!

Could happen. We're also destroying some.

With magstripes being so insecure (come on USA, we're still waiting for you to use chip+pin at least), that's actually very surprising. My bet is that the fault lies either another way (abusing banks' credulity) or in the stats themselves, but not in the tech.

I offer one bit.
@_date: 2015-02-28 15:50:10
Yup, I'm in there
@_date: 2015-03-19 18:39:16
Frankly, they suck
@_date: 2015-02-08 22:02:10
No. The point here is offline vs. online, and not speed.

The Microsoft Network - or MSN - a "curated" (restricted) version on the Internet, for which all information is controlled by a single entity. Didn't work out well. Most will only remember "MSN" as a chat service (Messenger).

Well, that's simply not true, at all. Where the fuck did you hear this utter bullshit?
