Welcome to the Bitcoin train! Seriously, hold on to them. Make sure it's offline storage, too. Don't want to have them caught in an exchange just to loose them. It's been an emotional ride for the past few years for me. I've seen it drop below what I bought in for and skyrocket, twice. Don't let the price affect you, hold steady and welcome to the ride!

Once you have the app installed on your android phone, couldn't you go into Settings -&gt; Data -&gt; (Bitcoin App) -&gt; Restrict Data Useage?
This would eliminate the use of 4G/3G network access to your Bitcoin wallet, while still being able to access it if you're connected to Wi-Fi.

China's market is also closed. I have been paying attention. I'm just in belief that the "weekend" is causing this, and that BTC will resume/rise the coming Monday when the market opens (in approx 22hrs). 
Granted, I've not done an entire months worth of research, but I'm more comparing it to the market opening/closing, in which I'm not 100% on either.
I guess I'm just estimating and hoping for some type of correction. I'm learning every second about BTC, but sometimes learning from your own mistakes makes the learning experience more enduring.

I saw that.  But for instance, if someone in the state bought it from silk road, once they receive the package, would that make it legal? 
@_date: 2013-10-30 18:25:00
Would it be beneficial for one person to have their BTC (or AltCoins) into mutiple wallets using different wallet applications? 
And then if one should plan on buying something, transferring a divided amount from each into the wallet of choice to make the purchase.
Visa Versa as well, if they receive money, it should be spread into multiple wallets.
I'm thinking in terms of security, in case someone somehow gets access to a wallet of one persons. Or is there a top wallet that is more secure than this option? Granted that speading BTC would require fees, but if fees = better security, would that be better?
@_date: 2013-10-30 19:22:49
Paper backups are your best bet. Some people use live-linux flash drives with btc stored on there, where you can keep it stored and accessed in case you absolutely need to, but spend the money and get a safe, and then use paper backups.
You're basically asking yourself how to store 20k USD at home.

No, but from what I'm understanding, say if I keep my BTC on a linux thumb drive and store it in a safe, that's the safest thing to do to keep the majority of my BTC that I don't plan to spend. 
I could use another flash drive with Linux to keep the BTC that I do want to spend (albeit not much). 
Flash drive == paper if stored in a safe without access to any outside hands or internet.

If I invested in 3x ATI 7970 cards with a 900w PSU, free electricity, would it be better to mine LTC than BTC?
I've used a couple of calculators, and even though I calculated both without having to pay for power, BTC is still showing negative. 
Ex. 1950MH/s out of 3x7970 @ 750w (total power). LTC after one year of mining could break me even. BTC would put me in the negative either way.
Hypothetically, since we can't tell where the BTC and LTC are going in terms of how much they're worth, if I could invest $1,000 in these cards (let's just forget degredation), it would pay off in a year and I would collect profit after that. 
Instead of doing fiat to BTC and watch it increase. Any insights? I know people are mining because they know they'll eventually make a profit, am I right?
@_date: 2013-11-07 15:03:43

Litecoin is silver to Bitcoin's gold. Its an opportunity for those who may want coin but not at a $300 price, with the ability to eventually switch into Bitcoin with ease. Some altcoins are mined differently as well, so different coins can be exchanged into other coins. 
@_date: 2013-11-11 13:12:30
No, CPUs cannot mine bitcoins as fast as a GPU can. There is some new coin called Protoshares (I believe) that is going to rely heavily on CPUs. (Found this out from LetsTalkBitcoin E57)
AMD/ATI GPUs are the primary cards that can mine at the highest MH/s than any other branded card/cpu at the moment.
