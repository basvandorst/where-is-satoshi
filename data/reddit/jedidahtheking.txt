Venezuela's heavy oil is worthless compared to Saudi Arabia's light oil.
Norway would be in worse condition than Venezuela if it was under the same sanctions as Venezuela is. Didn't factor that in did you?
@_date: 2019-02-14 01:45:19
How is it the best decision? Were the crippling sanctions destroying the Venezuelan economy not bad enough? And now you want to take away the last hard currency Venezuela has before it plunges into total anarchy and chaos?
How can anybody be this evil? Seriously. No, the gold will not go solely to funding the Venezuelan army, not when people are protesting about food prices. Depriving an impoverished country of the last money it has is pure evil, and the worst bit of it, you're claiming that you're doing this to help the Venezuelan people. Starving them to help them.

I thought the whole dictatorship idea was one man having all the power. Whatever idiot wrote the title needs to learn how to google.

It's all about convenience. Here in Canada and in the US we willingly give up all our data to big companies and the governments because of how convenient it makes things (Letting Alexa listen in on all your conversations, letting Apple get your "FaceID", letting Samsung get your fingerprint, letting Facebook know more about you than your mother does, etc).
If the Chinese system is more convenient then it is sure to come here in the next couple of decades or even years. We are definitely going to start cashless because governments absolutely love knowing about your every single transaction, it'll happen here soon enough.

Bitcoin isn't perfect either. Remember that ANYBODY can look up your transaction history if they have your wallet address. And if you're going to retort with ''you can still make hidden transactions without anybody else knowing'' then be prepared to never be able to cash out your holdings (if you wanted to) since crypto exchanges like Bittrex won't even let you transfer funds if they notice something fishy about your wallet address transaction history.
There's no evil money. Both cash and crypto have pros and cons and can be exploited by the government as they see fit.

I swear there was a countless amount of people back in 2017 saying ''Oh man, wish I got into crypto after it crashed back in 2015''. And now the same will happen soon enough. 2019 is going to be a great year to buy. Expecting markets to recover in 2020 though.

He got more votes than any of the opposition. "Self-inflicted" gun shots? The people that lost to him in the last election are still alive and well, even after having accused him of rigging the elections. Please inform yourself, this type of propaganda is bad. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 16:13:59
Nope it's not. Per example the Saud monarchy is the legitimate government of Saudi Arabia and I hate it nonetheless. 
It's a question about putting an end to a propaganda technique used to discredit governments. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 02:02:52
What the literal f? What does Stalin starving millions of Ukrainians have to do with this this?
I'll say it again, legitimacy is decided by who holds the UN seat while representing a country, and Maduro holds the seat for Venezuela. I mentioned Syria because the US pulled off the same stunt with Syria as well, said that the Syrian government was illegitimate while the """"moderate"""" rebels were the true representatives of Syria.
Let's just say that it didn't work out. Not for Syria, and not for Venezuela.

Great way of putting it there, I agree. I feel the same pressure when I don't follow trends as well. It seems like the more technology advances, the less privacy you get and the more convenient giving up your privacy becomes. Someone else on another sub told me why care if you have nothing to do hide? Truth is that information is power, and the more information a government has about you, the greater the power it can exert over you as well.

I don't blame them. Seen a small business owner that sells small items say that credit card companies ask for too much of a cut in transactions and that it's not worth it.
This is pure greed. Both Visa &amp; Mastercard are making billions yet they do this type of shit because they couldn't care less about small businesses going bust, only big businesses raking in more money for them.

There were grass roots protests going on under Maduro, that much is a fact. But when Guaido declared himself President after both Pompeo and Bolton told him to, the dissatisfaction with Maduro became a foreign-backed coup d'etat. 
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:27:00
It shouldn't be up to a bunch of bankers whether a country is deprived of billions or not. You're as equally bad as those you're judging.
@_date: 2019-02-14 00:34:06


Who is "people" apart from Pompeo and Bolton exactly? There is zero, and I mean ZERO, proof that the elections were a sham.
This is just another episode of US regime change in a not-favorable-to-US-imperialism situation. You'd think that the hundreds of thousands of deaths in the Syrian civil war would make you and the neocons in Washington hesitate about starting a civil war in another country but I guess life has little value to some.

Do explain how that disproves what I said? It's not a question of security, if somebody has your wallet address then they CAN know what ever you're doing with your crypto balance. Hence why after that QuadrigaCX guy died, everybody started looking for the address of his wallet so that if they noticed more transactions were being done, then they could conclude that he was still alive and faking his death.


I clearly said that would be a problem if you had a suspicious transaction history. Per example, if someone gave you 10 BTCs over the dark web and you tried cashing it out on Kraken then tough luck bud, they'll know where those 10 BTCs came from and will block your funds. How do they know? Wallet history of course.


Interesting, I'll give it a look. Looks like this wallet is seeking to fix the problem I've named to you. But it seems like it's very new and isn't fully functional yet.


Yeah, after seeing Coinbase and all the other exchanges blatantly say that they will hand over your info/wallet history to the government, I lost most hope in that. Crypto is not evolving in the way I was hoping it would. Feels like the government now only fears crypto because it represents a capital flight risk but that's it. In terms of privacy however, they seem to have no problem with crypto at all!

The UN matters because that's how international law works. Per example, the KMT used to be legitimate government of "China" until it lost its UN seat to the CCP. 
Also, there are more Venezuelans who want Maduro to President than Guaido, who never received a vote in his life.
@_date: 2019-02-14 01:24:31
What do you mean? Maduro is an elected official who is the head of the government that represents Venezuela in the UN Assembly. What makes you think that you are the one who decides a government's legitimacy and not international law?
Jeez, you tried pulling off the same shit with Syria, saying Assad wasn't legitimate and that the rebels were. After over 400,000 deaths, haven't any lessons been learned?
@_date: 2019-02-14 01:41:40
Frankly, I don't know. Maybe the Venezuelan government thought that the gold would be safer in the Bank of England than in Venezuela itself. Should've factored in the risk of politics though.
@_date: 2019-02-17 00:01:07
Nope. Currencies all throughout history used to have inherent value as they had valuable metals in them that give them their worth, and not merely "public trust" like today.
Per example, the Romans had silver in their coins. The value of Roman currency would depend on how much silver there was in the coins. But sadly even inflation eats this up.

Crypto is backed by crypto (maths) and gold is backed by history. Gold has always been a valuable commodity in all of human history across all civilizations, whether European, Asian or Middle Eastern.
