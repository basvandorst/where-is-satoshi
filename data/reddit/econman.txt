Uh if you let me own every last Bitcoin ever or all of Berkshire Hathaway,the answer is incredibly obvious. One is an actual value creating business.

Ok, what is false about it? Show me how either you can avoid paying taxes, or you can pay them in bitcoin. I will wait.
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:30:43
You have to pay US taxes in US dollars. If you don't, you will be sent to jail. Regardless of confidence, USD will be valued because of that.

I think it's more likely the user is misquoting their friends. They probably said they'd lose money, not that it was a scam. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:32:14


Let me quote you more specifically - "B is more secure than A and C," - to which I say, no it is not.


Then this isn't really a fair comparison. You're comparing the "worst practice" the Greek banking crisis, to the "Best practice". Why not compare averages? Again, in the western world, on average over the last decade, *far* more will have lost assets under bitcoin than in a bank.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:08:01


No, not at all. Anyone who, after probably 5 times of me asking to respectfully disagree, keeps doing so is probably immature. And, to give the benefit of the doubt, I assume fairly young. A normal, adjusted person could say "Hey, sorry about all that. Sounds like we didnt understand one another. My bad. :)" I've done so multiple times. You're just doubling down on this now.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:11:49
As long as you're not recommending someone put all of their money into Bitcoin because it had high returns in the past, we are in agreement :)
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:41:37


No? Why would that be. Bitcoin isn't even a good - it's supposed to be a currency is it not????!
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:24:03

How old are you? This is verging on paranoia that is mentally unstable
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:52:04
The question you answered is how will Bitcoin "overthrow Banks". You said because it reduces the theft/loss risks of holding your own assets. If you're not comparing to holding it in a bank, you weren't responding the question really.
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:34:07


Deflation isn't unique to bitcoin. Still, not a feature as probably 99% of economists would agree.


Let's say you 100% believe that there will never be more than 5 bottlecaps. Why don't you want them? Again, under the assumption you 100% believe me. 


Fixed assets do go down in value.

Sure, absolutely the strategy could be beneficial there. But if someone is that emotional, the general advice given here is horrible anyways, don't you think? If you're not thinking of this rationally, I wouldn't be advising them to invest in the first place.

@_date: 2017-12-15 22:05:05


Really? I doubt that, and the futures market seems to back up that it is much more risky to hold your assets in bitcoin than in a bank. How many people do you know that lost all their money by keeping it in a bank? Now how many do you know of that lost their private key? Sorry, but I don't buy it.

You're aware that by the logic presented in that post, you'd also be recommending pets.com in 2000, right?

....Yes. Reading this makes it clear 99% of this community don't have any financial background whatsoever. It seems like what they've learned has just come from each other in a very circle-jerky way. Just look up a couple threads to someone teaching how to "day-trade". 
The simple fact that THIS is the community around bitcoin, is very good evidence it's a bubble.
@_date: 2017-12-16 20:06:56
What's incorrect about that? Are you using two weeks to prove someone wrong? That seems *really* short-sighted.
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:47:27


Non-sequitor. If scarcity produces demand, why haven't first edition limited extra special Beanie Babies gone to $20mm by now? They're just as scarce. You're missing the demand element here, as are most people. Because you're viewing it as a get rich quick thing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:49:05


I mean, in theory I can also use my dollar bills to build a pyramid, but it's safe to say that 99% of people use it as a currency. The blockchain protocol is not unique to bitcoin.
And this was all in response to the suggestion that valuing bitcoin is different from valuing equities. It's not fundamentally different. There are many businesses that have network effects. We still value them based on cash flow or on underlying supply/demand data. Commodities for instance.
@_date: 2017-12-31 05:58:54


I'd still be saying it - I judge process, not results. And 99% of people don't understand finance or investing. If they won, they got lucky.

That's not how "history" works. You're dealing with an incredibly small sample size that is essentially 1. Yes, it's increased so far, that's no guarantee of anything in the future.

Dollar cost averaging *is* essentially trying to time the markets. If you have an asset which you expect to rise, on average, you invest it all immediately. Doing otherwise just lowers your returns.
This is just an echo-chamber with little financial background that's encouraging non-sensical theories.

Explain how it went down in value...You haven't done so. Hint: Supply/demand.


I do understand how bitcoin works. More importantly, I understand how markets work. Again, as you said, prices don't only go up or down, and there's no guarantee of either. So stop pretending like there is.

@_date: 2017-12-01 18:12:55


Well, no, it does, again unless you expect the market to go down on average. But then you wouldn't be buying in the first place.

That's non-sense. Traditional markets are backed by underlying businesses. Crypto currencies have their use, but are fundamentally useless.

No there aren't. This is the same thing as saying that "there are strong arguments both ways" in climate change. 99% of economists would agree that a fixed limit on currency is a bad thing. If you aren't an economist, I think it would be rationale to listen to them on that one.

They don't just decide to create money. I imagine you're referring to fractional reserve banking. That's not a bank deciding to create money, it's just literally the business model. The fed decides how much to tighten the money supply. 
Bitcoin is inherently deflationary. That's NOT a good thing. Any econ101 class would tell you that. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:35:41


I think that's exactly what this is. You're aware there are other crytpocurrencies out there, right? Not as big, absolutely. But, they are realistic competitors.


How is bitcoin "proven"? And how is it "single"? I don't think either is the case.
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:50:19


Yes, and the blockchain isn't just bitcoin, you understand that right?


I'll quote wise words from someone - "I'm always skeptical of people that claim they know everything."
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:47:06


Bitcoin is "single" in the sense that it is a single option out of many.  We agree on that. I THOUGHT you meant "single" in the sense that it was the only cryptocurrency out there.


Dude, have some fucking respect and calm down. Holy hell. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:45:25


Absolutely. Just like pets.com had its own market cap. It was *also* a part of the dot-com bubble, was it not? I think we are discussing an odd definitional issue you're having.


Come on, have some respect here. We can disagree without acting like that.


Yes, I think it is entirely possible that bitcoin is like pets.com. I hope that clarifies things for you.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:48:53
Right, so...currency? A currency won't be skyrocketing in value very much. Since that destroys its purpose as a currency. You can't have this both ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:41:34


Er, Bitcoin doesn't have ANY thoughts at all actually. 


Bitcoin doesn't "act" at all.


Yes, that doesn't imply the value will keep rising. And I fear that there's a lot of naive young people here who are assuming that.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:49:51
Well, yes. But you don't know when the all time high is...
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:27:00


Why would you stop if you have a winning strategy? That seems like poor advice.
In reality, I don't think you've described day-trading well. Day trading is essentially gambling, and so your advice IS relevant, but it's only as relevant as saying stop while you're ahead at the casino. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 17:43:20


Are you saying bitcoin is currently being used like a currency? Because...I just don't see that. If so, you'd have a point.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:40:03


Well, yes it does. The two are currently highly correlated.


Precisely my point. It's a dotcom bubble in the same sense as people arguing that pets.com was a first mover and had a huge "proven" advantage. Pets.com was also "single". It also went bankrupt.
@_date: 2017-12-16 00:07:16


*This is what I disagree with*, and was the point of my original response, to which you said you weren't comparing it to banks. Banks are more secure than holding bitcoin yourself. Again, I would bet than *nobody* has lost money in a bank by doing nothing. I would bet hundreds of people have lost their keys by holding bitcoin. B is not "more secure" to C.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:27:22
Ok redditor for 3 months
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:57:51


I agree, that if someone is trying to determine a specific time to invest it all, that's obviously foolish. But if you think an asset is going to rise, you just put it all in immediately. You don't wait a week or two, and you don't dollar cost average.
@_date: 2017-12-18 00:41:28
That's...not how prices work. Demand and supply are CURVES, not static values. Price is what equalizes the two. So it makes no sense at all to say the ratio is "unbalanced". By definition, it is balanced at the current price. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:47:30
Then how does it EVER go down in value? The other day it dropped, how did that happen? (Hint: Nothing about a fixed supply implies what you keep insisting it implies - this is the type of financial ignorance I'm talking about)
@_date: 2017-12-02 17:53:07
Good for you :) Could you make money trading GM?
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:57:01

@_date: 2017-12-03 22:11:24


Yes, right now. We are talking about the future. You're like someone in 2000 saying, "Hey, you need to go through yahoo.com to get to any other internet site. It's going to be almost impossible to overtake, it has the best engineers." I'm not saying you're necessarily wrong, but you're WAY overconfident, that's for damned sure. Again, no offense, but how old are you?
@_date: 2017-12-03 19:46:10


That's quite a claim without much evidence behind it.


Like myspace was? Being first mover has advantages, but it isn't everything.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:40:45


Your logic would have held for them as well...until of course it didn't.


I'm not a skeptic of the technology. I AM a skeptic about the investment rationale. Because this seems like a classic bubble - no-educated people using really poor logic boosting the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:30:05
I do understand how it works. But this is quite irrelevant, a "value proposition" doesn't guarantee anything. Every business in the world has a theoretical value proposition, and they can also go under. Bitcoin is only valuable if people are using it.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:46:10


Seriously, that's the definition of some sort of a get rich quick scheme. The *supposed* value of Bitcoin is as a currency. Currently, that value is really really poor. It's volatile, it has a fixed upper cap, transactions take a long time, and they're expensive. So instead you have people saying to buy Bitcoin because it's going to be worth more later because people will buy it because it's going to be worth more later...
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:39:14

"Sneaker-male"? Like, I'm pretending to be a male? Ok...I must admit that's kinda hilarious. I don't see how it's an insult or a bad thing, but still hilarious.
If I may, I hope you aren't over-investing in Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-17 18:12:00
You called it a "network good". If by "Network good" you just meant "Oh, it's worth more because other people also want it now" then...that also applies to Tulips. Network good, in terms of bitcoin, is pretty much only relevant to its use as a currency, which is minimal right now.
@_date: 2017-12-01 18:44:38
That's going to reduce returns on average. Not sure how that became "common wisdom" here but the echo chamber hasn't helped. "Cost-averaging" on an increasing asset just reduces returns.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:18:31
You think Bitcoin is going to change more than the internet itself would? (And look at the dot com bubble)

@_date: 2017-12-02 17:54:12


Of course, but if you are investing it in the *first place*, you HAVE to think that the probability of it rising is higher than the probability of it falling. Otherwise you're being fairly irrational.
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:51:34
I think you're a tad unhinged, frankly. "YOU FUCKIGN LOSER&gt;" seems like a ten year old mashing on a keyboard. 


No, but without a history I'm not one to guess. And you're the one accusing me of internet hopping and trolling and sneaking being a male or whatever you're saying. And I have a far longer history to view than you do.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:53:03
Again, you're arguing these odd definitional issues that are secondary to me. Would you consider pets.com to be a part of the dot-com bubble? It's a single entity that, in my mind, was a part of the bubble. And when the bubble burst, so did it. That's wha tI think could happen here.


How old are you?

@_date: 2017-12-03 19:49:49


LMAO, this is the weirdest part about this subreddit. On one hand,everyone talks about this being the next currency for everyone. In reality though, I'd say 99% of posts are about how much USD bitcoin is worth and how much it will continue to increase. Hint: If you're still thinking about it in terms of USD, it's probably not a great currency yet.

I'm not sure why you're arguing that as a currency (or are we admitting bitcoin isn't a currency?) deflation is a *feature*. I'd say it's a fairly commonly accepted idea that that's a *negative* to a currency.
And again, that still depends on people trusting that others will want it at some point. Just because something is limited forever, doesn't imply its value will rise. Otherwise, I have 5 bottlecaps with my signature that I can sell you as a "storeof value". And there will never ever ever be more than just 5, I promise :)


There's no formal theory because that isn't true. Debt/savings are too sides of the same coin - moving consumption in time. With debt, you are transferring consumption from the future to now. With savings, you are transferring consumption now, to the future. Human capital investment for example is a great use of debt. And amybe you mean that by "productive asset".

Ugh, this is just more misinformation. If you assume an asset will increase on average over time, DCA doesn't help you. It just reduces your returns.


Assuming that the asset will continue to increase, yes. That may or may not be a good assumption - again, sample size is essentially one here.
@_date: 2018-05-19 00:40:31
You're wrong.
S&amp;P average right now is 1.84%
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:25:45
S&amp;P500 is hardly small companies. Ok what index shows an avg dividend of 5%? And stop changing your words. You said it was normal in general. Not just for a small subset. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:09:04
I have already shown you the average dividend is HALF of that level.

This is a really long way of saying "You're right, and it's really difficult for me to admit you're right, so instead of saying 'I was wrong, sorry' I will just ignore that and call your names. You're autistic for calling me on incorrect data!!!"
It's funny how difficult it is emotionally for people to admit when they are wrong.

Exponential growth? I'm sorry, but this is a horrible expectation.
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:43:18
Past doesn't predict the future. ESPECIALLY when your gains have occurred over maybe five years max. My advice is to not extrapolate that to the future. Equities will be the long run winner here. 
@_date: 2018-05-18 17:42:12
5% is NOT a normal dividend level though. Not sure where you got that idea from. Maybe for utility companies. If I had to guess, the avg right now is probably closer to 1-2%
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:18:13
Sure, maybe for a small period of time.
@_date: 2014-02-26 00:32:02
Because its not sustainable for any long period of time. You actually ARE assuing something is special if you say that.
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:32:32


What gives it value is supply and demand. Full stop. There's nothing about bitcoin that guarantees a certain amount of demand for the rest of time. Again, full stop. That's true for every product and every service. If you disagree, please provide a reason for why bitcoin will have demand for eternity.

You can't produce Econman coins. There is only one in the world and I have it. :)

That doesn't work to increase returns though...Not sure why you'd recommend that.

Dollar Cost Averaging doesn't work on average, unless you are truly assuming that the asset is on average going to decrease. But at that point, why are you investing it in in the first place.
It concerns me how poor people's financial literacy is here.
@_date: 2018-02-04 21:55:12
Yes, and if you put people who are whipped, unable to leave their homes, under the same word as modern fast food workers, your definition is so vague as to be meaningless. Subjective doesn't mean "meaningless", as much as students try to pretend it does.
@_date: 2019-01-27 18:30:43
So this ISNT an "academic" survey and you're just lying. Otherwise your ethics board would make all that disclosure mandatory. 
@_date: 2018-02-17 19:14:10


Yes it would. It wouldn't be a great moment in economic history, but it would definitely be possible. Does the term FDIC mean anything to you?
Also, if you are curious, how many bitcoins have been lost or stolen? How much USD has been lost due to bank runs in all of history? (I'm genuinely curious)
@_date: 2018-02-19 07:16:56
For growth yes, that's very different than a proxy for inflation. I invest in the stock market to make money, but I'd never call that a "proxy for inflation". The two are very different things. 
Honestly I don't follow what your point is. If we switch to Bitcoin housing prices will fall dramatically? And then nobody will need a mortgage anymore? Just how low will these prices be?
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:59:56
The issue was never lack of information. It was with the general public's ability to accurately understand complex financial arrangements and understand the risk present. The internet changes none of that.

You're aware that a currency that deflates is almost universally viewed as a bad thing right?

My last *submission*, yes, not my last *post*/comment. But holy irrelevancy. *That* is the reason you won't "Get into it with me"? Forget the last part if you want, I'm genuinely curious how "humanity" is supposed to "take advantage of this".

@_date: 2018-11-04 18:58:08
Seriously - it reads like an edgy critique from a college kid about why the world sucks these days. But then, there's never a connection to the value of the dollar. If college was cheap would the dollar be worth more? Like what?

Nobody buys a house as a "proxy for inflation". That would be insanely expensive and insanely stupid. And to buy a house you'd still need a mortgage. Or 98% of people would. Bitcoin changes nothing except the unit of currency on that one

You mean academic economists? You sound like a conspiracy theory. Academic economists don't make money off of that. Come on. 
@_date: 2018-02-19 00:33:55
Yes, but it's not a good thing. Money managers allocate capital and savings to investment projects. That's a useful skill. 
@_date: 2018-02-18 22:48:33


Such as what? Not investment banking, not sales and trading, not commercial banking. Maybe retail banking is your point but honestly holding bitcoin is a horrible replacement for most consumers to their local real bank.


Again, which specific people are redundant by bitcoin? The only obvious answer I can come up with is the IT people in the retail bank who have to worry about securing the database of who owns what. That's....not a "large portion".
@_date: 2018-02-19 18:20:04
Ok, it's just unclear what is going to be automated then, that couldn't be automated without Bitcoin in the first place. Do you have a job title as an example?
@_date: 2018-02-04 00:40:36


You still shouldn't. Bitcoin is a *horrible* currency, completely objectively. If your currency is bouncing around in value so much, it's not a great currency.
@_date: 2018-02-18 21:59:51


Ok how would you take advantage of it?


Let me guess, the "banksters" are the oligarchs and tyrants? It's tough to take this seriously when it sounds like angsty 15 year olds who barely understand finance.

What status do you have if you have one Bitcoin? Honestly, what status?
@_date: 2018-04-26 00:12:27
Owning dollars don't have that status though. Which is also the best "brand".

Because no nation would ever want a world currency, and there has never been a world currency in modern times. I'm not saying that bitcoin doesn't have a place somewhere (although I think that place is far more diminished than what people here suggest) but that suggesting it as a world currency is extreme.
Sure, maybe there's some extremely small likelihood it happens. But again, it's on the same lines of "Let's assume Amazon takes over all retailing..." If you're going to consider that probability, you have to consider the probability that BitCoin becomes useless/fades into obscurity, and if I were to compare the two likelihoods, I think the latter is stronger.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:16:58
An extrapoloation of any past financial return is extremely foolish. In 2007, you would have bought masses of real estate with that logic.
@_date: 2013-11-23 16:16:16
...So can a stock?
@_date: 2013-11-18 06:15:32


This isn't evidence that it is good advice. I'm sure everyone said this in 1999 as well about the new internet sites that were making everyone rich.
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:02:08


The rest of your analysis comes from this assumption. Which is a GIGANTIC one. It's like if I said "IF Walmart takes over all retail" then provide a stock price based on that estimate. Sorry, but that's not going to happen.
@_date: 2013-12-01 19:18:15
My point is that the X he uses is not feasible and isn't going to happen. So nobody should care about the Y.
