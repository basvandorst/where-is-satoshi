You're not making logically sound arguments.  To contrast what you said, if every person who was into gaming decided to embrace and play Pokemon when it was released in 1996 then it would have been wildly more popular than it was.
  
Just as all games are not equal, all money is not equal too.  No single form of money on earth is 100% adopted by all people who like money.  Bitcoin was the first of its kind and so it had to build its base from mostly nothing.  Each crypto project following has an easier time garnering attention due to the growing base and just as Pokemon had a captive base, new crypto enthusiasts will have a base they can join and that base will throw its weight around for new projects.  The DAO was an excellent example of this new base adopting a new crypto project.  Even though it didn't succeed, it had a very successful start entirely because of its base and the framework that it built.

It's been fun watching the circle make a few orbits on this subject.  First was "oppressive" for filtering out the trolls and creating an environment that is not conducive to their agenda.  So they all flocked to where Ver very quickly realized his sub was going to be gamed if he didn't fight it.  Now you all are complaining about not being able to game either and pitting the subs against each other.  It is all rather humorous.

Do you have a link to where he said that?  I'd also be interested in knowing more about his background.

No, I try to buy one every paycheck and I get paid twice a month.  I was buying more than one per paycheck when they were under $300 and I bought less than one per paycheck when they were over $800.
  
I started with a goal of getting 21 Bitcoin because I liked the idea that there could never be more than a million people with more bitcoin than me, in reality it is a lot less than that.  But I met that goal in the first year of buying and just kept going.

That's interesting since Uber has been accepting my Coinbase Shift Card for as long as I have had it.

I buy every paycheck.  I like to try and pick a price and buy manually using my Coinbase mobile app.  I can see a day coming where I won't be able to afford to buy a whole bitcoin at a time and I have mixed feelings about that.  If I had a lump sum of money, I would dump it all in bitcoin right now.

It will ask you for your BIP38 password when you use the right option.  I think the right option is "Cold Storage" on the iOS app.

Greg is on reddit, maybe he will speak up here.
  
I'm curious why it matters?

Probably kraken.com

It's not really inspirational to me since they had a captive base to begin with and just extended it to smart phones which everyone already had.
