Obviously this is a far fetched question but what would happen to the bitcoin network if china lost power?

Thank you for your well developed response. This block took about an hour and a half, I thought that was interesting. I turned on my miners tgis morning for the first time in a few months for fun.

If the focus is on your family and not the network it would not have mattered what coin they held after 10 hrs.

70% of hashrate dropping wouldnt have an effect? Not that all of china is going to lose power but what if? 
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:59:03
I was kind of expecting you to say something like transaction time would increase by x% it seems far fetched that there would be no change but I obviously dont have a clue.
@_date: 2019-03-09 14:51:35
Most reports say they have around 70% of hashrate. I'm just being curious.

Thank you for your input and I hope for a peaceful and prosperous solution for Venezuela!!!

Or maybe I shpuld rephrase, if I lose electricity how would I go about using my bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-03-09 15:21:01
I'e been listening to revolutions podcast about Simon Bolivar and it seems like such an awesome and beautiful place.

How does bitcoin work without electricity?

I may or may not that doesnt make what I said untrue. What if I was born with no arms or legs and am typing this with a pencil between my teeth, would it be appropriate to point out that I cannot comb my own hair? Again you are just blaming me for being less fortunate.

Well you arent very good with this discussion thing other than blaming people for all of the scenarios I referenced. I hope you find a way to replace fear and anger with peace and love for your fellow man. I wish you luck.

No it seemed more like you suggested something you knew might be true and then blamed him for being a victim just like you blame poor people for being poor.  I dont doubt that on a conscious level you thought you were being funny but it was really just your subconscious reiterating that might is right.

Should he be? Are bullies in the correct? This is pretty demonstrative of how rich people feel about poor people, bullies says he deserved it because he is weak, the rich say he deserves it because he chose to be poor. What pieces of shit.

Why would you blame me for that. Wouldnt that be based on genetics and the underfunded public schools I attended? Thanks for blaming me for these things that are not in my control.
@_date: 2019-08-31 15:05:28
It was your insinuation and justification not mine.
@_date: 2019-04-03 09:00:23
Why? I do not understand, do feel that he is lying?

Thots and pears, my man.
