Even though your browser might not save the cache, there might still be a record on the HDD. Might be worth paying some good money for an expert to try to recover?

RemindMe! 3 years
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:02:10
Interesting! 
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:35:08
It's a joke mate
@_date: 2017-08-01 18:42:30
Mine was made well before that though
@_date: 2017-08-04 12:04:22
Well, it's only an investment if you have done your research and weighed up the risks. Otherwise it's gambling. They say if you have 6hrs to cut down a tree, spend the first 4 sharpening the axe!

This said - Anyone know how to do stop losses in bitcoin trading?
@_date: 2017-08-08 11:22:12
Yes, perhaps the smart money knows it's already going ahead, so it's been factored in
@_date: 2017-08-06 06:07:35
If it's any consolation bro, I'd fuck your sister for that too
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:23:09
No not at all, it's just gone down by that amount or thereabouts. Weird!
Edit: All my transaction deposits add up to my old higher figure. There's no outgoing BTC but still the result is a tadd smaller. Oh well, I'll hold and wait a while, it'll probably sort itself out :-)
@_date: 2017-08-05 09:45:46
Wow... thats big! What kind of work environment was it?
@_date: 2017-08-18 04:46:20
Is that what's going on today?
@_date: 2018-06-16 11:05:41
[Zoomed with continuation of trend]( Bull break confirmed.

The cost is for electricity to power the computers that verify the transactions. It's extraordinarily inefficient, but very secure.

You many not have a hundred million dollars but you have my upvote. 
@_date: 2017-07-19 23:17:12
Thanks for the link. Do you know how I can open or view the book after downloading? Noob here!
@_date: 2017-07-18 11:23:37
Send them to me and... I'll make sure you get it after ten years.... :-) ???  
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:24:08
How's that going for ya?
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:08:02
Haha maybe. If people want to lie on an anonymous poll then good on em?
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:05:45
Yep - names don't show on the poll
@_date: 2017-07-18 13:57:54
I agree! - There's no incentive to lie really, I mean, it's totally anonymous. I don't know why anyone would. But yeah, it'll be interesting!!
@_date: 2017-07-21 04:43:56
How many bitcoins do you have?
@_date: 2017-07-28 00:32:21
Are you from Venezuela?
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:20:32
Yah. It had 4 upvotes just a second ago, then back to two.. weird!
@_date: 2017-07-18 14:04:42
I agree, all eggs in one basket is risky. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:52:15
Are you able to please translate that to english? Also what does the article say? Thanks so much :-)
