My dad distrusts Bitcoin because there's no teller service, I've tried explaining him, but he still asks me the same question "where do I go to exchange these Bitcoins for dollars ?"

I have a feeling you never read my original post, you just saw the words suck and your brain just went oh no, someone is attacking Bitcoin again , to the BitcoinCave to put on the Troll outfit. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:15:47
I already did, you might want to check your ego, I mean who the fuck made you the sheriff of the internet you little piece of shit &lt;- that's a derogatory remark, I was just pointing out my experience. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:04:10


Right, you were so helpful in a non condescending way, you should work for customer support at the dmv, they'll appreciate your ways.

Signing up for coinbase was a pain, but in comparison I guess it wasn't that bad, I also have other accounts on other exchanges, so on about 5 companies total. The issue is that it's not getting easier... 
@_date: 2014-09-17 18:54:55
Because my house metaphorically caught on fire so I had to leave in a hurry and couldn't polish it to a higher standard, sorry I failed you.

Buy on Coinbase, transfer to your own offline/online wallet and then spend as you like. It's not ideal, but they seem to stop tracking past the first transaction. 
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:41:34
Thanks I just got this from them:
"It appears your account was delayed due to our fraud prevention monitoring system" (But If I hadn't contacted them they couldn't care less)
"Our team is currently reviewing your account information and will get back to you within the next few business days."
So let's see.

Their TOS :
It's a bit legalese, but if they were following past immediate transactions, they would have to state it.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:39:32
I am not clicking on anything you post, could be malware for all I know, don't be lazy and use your own words.

Some alternative explanations I came up with while in the crapper:
- A fraction of russian outflows ($120 billion +) is being allocated to BTC.
- Wall St is at record highs, and BTC is/was at year lows, so it's a hedge trade in case Wall St pops.  
   
- Short squeeze as others have mentioned.
- The winki BTC ETF is imminent and insiders are trading.
- Donald trump is giving his staff a few BTC for christmas and he hates the holiday rush.
- Obama is in China,a clear buying sign for chinese traders. 
- Escaped trading bots from the Thai BTC mine that burned are running amok.
- It's happening = )

Been a customer for a Yr or so and can't wait to jump ship to a better exchange/wallet. They seem to really don't give a shit about customers. 
P.s. I am still waiting for them to answer a support issue I had in November 2013 : )

I don't get attacked on r/dogecoin just for posting my experience with a company, even if I say something derogatory,if you go look at others comments on circle this is not an isolated issue. But here you come out like some Bitcoin defender just wanting to impose your views and save the day. This is in part why Bitcoin is having a hard time being accepted. YOU.
@_date: 2014-12-04 19:38:16
Ohh yeah, The good old r/bitcoin welcoming mat.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:33:29
I discounted your original reply for what it is, a fanboys small ego reaction to the unbearable fact that he is nobody and his only mean of getting it up is through imposing and attacking others anonymly on a public forum. I am actually a little sad and concerned about you.
@_date: 2014-12-04 20:44:49
I understand, you must be so busy with very important things, I won't keep you, go on.
@_date: 2014-11-22 18:44:59
I've traded with them for almost a year now and have seen orders mismatched, like I have a buy at 60 satoshis for some Doge and the market moves down to 55 and completely skips mine and a few other traders orders before returning to 60... fun times.
I believe that they'll either get their act together ( they seem at least to be trying), or disappear when a better alternative comes along.
@_date: 2014-11-14 19:12:54
I would drop it, here's why: There is a ton of better trading platforms for forex, equities and money market. It is a niche and very competitive market, so while you might succeed in building the best Bitcoin Trading Platform, the moment Bloomberg gets into CryptoCurrencies in say a few years you would have a real challenge.
The other thing you could do is just split or pivot if you are looking for a project, I believe there could be a market for either a better bid/offer box, a better troll box, or better charts, all these could be plugins.
I believe you should make a product once you have identified the demand, building something and later expecting others to pick it up is dicey.
Just my 2 cts

Dude!, go check out the wiki for Paypal under criticism, they have a solid track record of being quasi-evil, on a more personal note they have :
- Withhold payment on items sold on ebay, temporarily frozen my account and canceled my debit card. 
They had the fortune to be the first to market but they have behaved like a monopolistic bully ever since, no thanks. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 22:24:31
As a child that grew up communicating solely through interpretative dance I face unique challenges. Thanks for being so understanding.

Thanks, the hash problem, or attacks on the network or the 51% attack is a different one  (solved for now by merged mining as you point out) I was referring to the relationship in between the price and miners, I'll try articulating it better and for Bitcoin:
Let's say it is 2030, and 98% of bitcoins have been mined, the fees and the price are such that with the fees you generate mining bitcoin you can't pay for your electricity and hardware costs, what happens then ?
 
@_date: 2015-01-14 01:51:44
Well, oil keeps going down, and their reserves are not endless, so  capital controls might be forthcoming, Bitcoin is a convenient way to get around those, so it sucks, but makes sense.
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:55:21
57% of hashrate is distributed in between 4 pools today : ) 
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:33:22
That was the chosen solution, why do you think Bitcoin is immune to 51% attacks ? 
@_date: 2015-01-11 01:48:15
Altcoins like Litecoin and my case study Dogecoin are a good way to experiment with variations and issues bitcoin might encounter, I know about sidechains, but having a whole coin,community and ecosystem that has chosen a different path, rewards schedule or demographic might help perfect or complement Bitcoin.
I can't speak for Litecoin, but in Dogecoin land we are at the end of our initial supply and we are going through some problems Bitcoin might encounter in the future, what for instance happens with the price and network when it's no longer profitable to mine, surprisingly not much if you have a solid community, at least for now, we also have heavy speculation and a passionate but change adverse community.
We were down 55% in dollar terms and slightly positive 5% against Bitcoin last year, so against all odds and expectations we did not collapse and die. 
@_date: 2015-01-11 03:58:20
I am not sure I follow, the hashrate of bitcoin has steadily increased :
While the price has tumbled. The self regulating system is a simplistic way of looking at it, there are speculators and brand loyalty to account for, my point being Dogecoin is ahead in figuring out this relationship.
@_date: 2019-06-15 00:27:26
I can't afford either, so yeah pretty much the same : (

More like a sand Mandala that get's blown to smithereens every other day.

That's more like an art project : )
