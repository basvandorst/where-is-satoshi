My mom referred to my hot wallet as "hot pocket"

Yeah, that's exactly what it is for. Any text field on a computer can be typed into, so you can apply steno for general use. Essays, reddit comments, or even things like typed chat in-game on multiplayer titles should all work.
I'd say an average person would still need to be a pretty determined average person. It takes a lot of effort to get to a point where you can comfortably use it as your primary input for written language.
The configuration files I'm using are not too difficult to modify if you read the documentation for the firmware, and the keyboard comes already loaded with a toggleable standard layout with all the keys a normal keyboard has (tucked away in shifted layers) in addition to the Plover mode.
The limited number of keys makes it really bad for some games, though. You probably wouldn't want to entirely replace your main keyboard with one.
If you have a standard mechanical keyboard with NKRO, someone designed 3D-printable keycaps designed for steno. That's what I'd recommend using to learn.
@_date: 2017-11-18 01:45:08
There are massive advantages if you're able to climb up the initially steep learning curve. Instead of being a different keyboard layout, it is an entirely different input method.
With Colemak, you still press one key at a time that corresponds to individual letters. So Colemak is simply an efficient rearrangement of letters on a normal keyboard. With steno, you write out entire syllables, words, or even phrases by pressing multiple keys simultaneously. To remember the enormous number of possible key combinations, they follow a set of patterns that tie to pronunciation and/or spelling to form a mnemonic theory.
For example, you can use your left hand fingers to type beginning consonant sound, your thumbs do the vowel sound, and your right hand fingers do the ending sound to form a complete syllable. Various techniques like omitting certain vowels or using special abbreviations known as "briefs" allow you to condense text input even further. It feels more like speaking through your fingers than typing.
With continued use and practice, you should ultimately be able to reach speeds as fast as you can talk, or possibly faster.

Keyboards have a microcontroller onboard to translate the raw presses into something that the computer can receive.
So maybe you could implement firmware that lets you type a message, storing the message onboard rather than outputting it as keyboard input. Then you press a key combination that tells the firmware to begin automatically inserting whitespace characters between your normal words in a way that encodes your original message.
Possible and totally useless.

It is 2 AM here and in my sleepiness I somehow thought you were interested in getting ahold of one of my strange keyboards, hence my asking for a physical address.

To be honest, I haven't had any time to put into learning to use my own keyboard. There were no truly good hardware options available that were cheap and did what I wanted when I first started, which is why I started to make this thing.
I do about 15-30 wpm on it so far. On my normal keyboard I do 100-120 wpm.
On my bike, I go as fast as the speed limits permit.

Nope, haven't posted yet. I'm waiting until I finish assembling the current batch of keyboards because I'm afraid people might want to buy it before I've even caught up with orders.

Your profit-sharing concept made me realize something.

I don't have extra bitcoin at the moment (spent virtually all of it on tooling costs for injection-molding the keycaps and purchasing materials), but PM me and I might be able to offer business-related help!

I do accept bitcoin! However, I didn't post the link because I don't feel comfy doing advertising until I have fully-built keyboards in stock and ready to ship. Right now it is in a sort of preorder state for the Plover community while I wait for the bulk materials to ship to me.
Since you're specifically asking about accepting bitcoin, [here is the site](

Thanks! I enjoyed reading the 200 btc story and thought I'd post my own experience. Not anything crazy, but I hoped it'd give some warm fuzzies

Without finding out about Plover's existence, I wouldn't have even made my keyboard. Plover is what makes affordable steno possible at all.

Yes, bought myself a new computer mouse on Amazon. The bookmarklet also worked on the Oculus Rift dev kit page but I decided not to purchase it yet.
It's pretty simple to use and it is legit. Super quick customer service response from my experiences and you get free shipping with Prime on Amazon items that have it.

Thanks! I get to try it out a week earlier than expected, then.

Probably enough. I haven't yet had a chance to test transferring anything because I have zero bitcoin at the moment, but so far I understand everything that is already explained on the faq of the Bitcoin website. Since it is still "experimental," I'm only exchanging as much money as I can afford losing. The lack of backing is irrelevant to me because I think people will always see the inherent practical value in a system that allows exchanges in this way, so its continued use will provide the demand that gives it value.
I've also made a bootable Fedora USB stick and used that, offline, to help print out a paper wallet split into multiple sections, where each paper stores certain parts of the key so that I need any three out of five papers to put together the key. This wallet I use as my secure savings sort of spot. Then I have another wallet on my desktop computer that I have backed up to my Google account and onto a USB stick encrypted with TrueCrypt. And I have a little tiny wallet that I keep on my phone and backed up in a slightly lazier way to keep as active spending money. To exchange BTC with USD, I use Authy with Coinbase and transfer the funds to my local accounts as soon as I can.
I'll keep buying Bitcoin as I use it because I currently don't get paid in BTC and I have no products or services to sell.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:36:26
That is what I'm saying.
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:11:36
Yes, recognizing exactly that is part of the realization that if you lose nothing using Bitcoin, then spending it and asking everywhere if it is accepted helps it along. The more it is helped along, the more it is worth. So, in the end, you're only doing yourself a favor by using your currency instead of hoarding it.
@_date: 2013-10-31 22:48:52
Once everything is already set up, this turned out way simpler to use than I imagined. Especially with the way apps and automatic QR codes are done.
Was that second transaction someone else? There are two transactions now and I have half a dollar equivalent, which is already way more than I expected. I was picturing a ten cent bitcointip-style microtransaction just to see how it works in person..
EDIT: Finding out how to set up a bitcointip account so I can respread the wealth to potentially two people whom I deem excellent.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:55:37
In the long term I think it will end even better than how it kind of works short term. I can picture a transition over time from being used more as a commodity to more as a currency. Right now speculators are going crazy and helping cause the value to shoot everywhere, but as more people hop on board and the bigger it becomes, the slower it moves, right?
So far I've personally ignored what value bitcoin is at and made purchases whenever I've felt like it, and I've ended up paying a more even average. Surprisingly, even if I had spent some during a flash crash, I'd still be saving money overall.
@_date: 2013-11-27 06:32:19
Yes, snapCard is great! The live chat feature is connected to their cells so their availability is amazing.
A computer mouse I ordered just shipped in and it is such a weird feeling to hold, in my hands, something I've bought on Amazon with "magic internet money". This is legit.
@_date: 2013-11-20 20:22:01
I might be experiencing a similar issue.
I put in some orders for bitcoin back in November 13th. My bank messed up and caused a charge to be reversed because a check apparently cleared and didn't clear at once, depending on whether I checked the mobile app or computer. Like some kind of Schrödinger's check... This caused the order to be cancelled, after which coinbase automatically cancelled the other order as well, even though the other order was already withdrawn.
I realize that the fraud algorithm's enthusiasm needs to be there while it is still under development so that people don't take advantage in the meantime. However, the second order is now in this withdrawal limbo where the money has been withdrawn but the bitcoins have been cancelled, while the deposit of the money back into my account is perpetually pending and has been locked up for nearly a week after it was cancelled. In my case, it is just under $600 being locked up completely and another $200 that was sent back but coinbase has no room for recourse for retrying payment if anything goes wrong.
I love the convenience of coinbase for someone like me, who isn't day trading and doesn't mind the delays, but when each order feels like I'm flipping a coin to see if my price really does get locked in or if days later I'll get hit with a cancellation and don't know how long I'll be waiting for support isn't so great. I just want my ~2 bitcoins to come through.
I'm naturally still going to worry even though I know all the bitcoin exchanges and services have been completely slammed the other day. In the meantime I'm still trying to slowly pump in more USD to BTC as I get more cash though. Hopefully these purchases don't get messed up as well.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:39:21
I don't have a single unit to do both things. I have diversified from dollars into bitcoin. Yes, bitcoin does, by itself, also do both things. Why is this a real problem, though? It doesn't hurt me if some people want to treat it like a commodity, some treat it like a currency, and some treat it like all sorts of other things. If anything, having multiple potential functions gives it even more value. Just because it has multiple functions doesn't mean I'm putting all my eggs in one basket by using it.
Even if I somehow was able to use Bitcoins as a complete replacement of the dollar doesn't mean I wouldn't invest using other tools as well.
@_date: 2013-12-03 21:44:45
I have been spending my bitcoin all along, my most recent purchase being a Nexus 5 through snapCard which I'll (hopefully) be able to pay service for with Gyft. The way I see it, saving money is OK but trying to hoard continuously is pretty silly. The same mindset of "Why spend it if it is going to go up so much more?" is like asking "Why buy high end computer hardware if it'll go outdated in such a short time?"
I don't think I need to explain why this idea is a little crazy.
And although deflation does encourage hoarding, it is only up until they realize it is counterproductive. If they want to make the most of bitcoin, they can keep putting more money into bitcoin and spending it at a similar rate for things they'd normally be buying anyway. Using bitcoin only encourages more use and adoption.
@_date: 2013-10-31 21:14:00
I have to admit I wouldn't mind my currency deflating a whole lot on the side, but decentralized currency is simply too neat to push around or sit on just for the $$.
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:45:36
Well, I did try the Coinbase app on my phone and doing everything directly through Coinbase would be somewhat easier for me, but I always feel more comfortable when things are more directly under my control. I suppose it is just a psychological thing. Besides, once all that effort in setting up is done, it ends up being easy afterward anyway; just a single extra step. The sole reason I picked Coinbase was that it seemed the most reputable place to get BTC. I was not as interested in their web wallet and other ease-of-use features.
I can certainly see the appeal, but I still prefer it this way.
@_date: 2013-11-20 09:37:29
Earlier today I ordered a new computer mouse on Amazon using bitcoin through the snapCard service that was posted on this subreddit a little while back. If my order comes in I'll make another post about it because being able to order products on Amazon is a game-changing step for me in terms of bitcoin.
And Amazon isn't the only place that it works with. The way it works is you have a little bookmarklet that you hit whenever you're on a page of basically any e-commerce site you want to order from and it'll provide buttons for you to order whichever products you want. They then order it for you to your address and send you a bitcoin invoice.
It is in a closed beta right now so it's all still being ironed out, but if it continues to work out the way it is with the brilliant and often instant support I've experienced so far, I'm going to be using this for basically every purchase I make. Even if [read: when] major retailers start accepting bitcoin directly, snapCard is still pretty useful because a secondary benefit to the system is that it creates a single universal shopping cart for things you might buy across multiple sites.

We "only" see tens of millions pouring in. The ATM network being set up in Shenzhen, the ATM in Canada, Circle Financial, etc. We see legislation in Germany, the Senate hearing in the US, and all that stuff too. The spread is picking up pace and the more people recognize what it can be allows for, the more people will hop on board. I've already been able to buy lattes from the cafe down the street from me.
The vendors using the services that let them immediately cash out to dollars are just a stopgap solution while bitcoin remains volatile and risky. But even if stores continue to use a system in which they cash out to dollars and never eventually accept it directly, that isn't a problem. It would still continue to work. The store automatically sells their bitcoin and I go on the internet and buy bitcoin back with my paycheck. It doesn't matter that they aren't doing business directly in bitcoin.
EDIT: Oh look, Woo says thumbs up to bitcoin's potential too. Hmmm...
@_date: 2013-12-04 02:19:35
It isn't asking if you'd like an i5 in 10 years. It is asking if you'd like an i5 right now or if you'd like a much nicer processor later. If you get the i5 now, you get to use it now. If you wait to get the much nicer processor later, you won't be able to use a processor in the meantime. How long do you wait until you buy the processor?
With the dollars, it is either that you have $10 to spend now or $50 to spend later. It does sound reasonable to say that you'd rather have the $50 later, but then why wait only at $50 if it is going to keep going up? How about waiting until you have $1000? Or $100000? 
I'm not comparing the value of computer hardware to the value of bitcoin, because computer hardware loses its value while bitcoin appreciates in value. Maybe I didn't phrase what I was trying to say quite right, but the idea is that I can either put my money to use now or put my money to use later for something greater. Buried bitcoin does absolutely nothing for you besides store your value and potentially grow in value. Purchasing goods or services with your bitcoin is when you bring in your possible rewards. Buying computer hardware now gives me what I want now. Buying computer hardware later for the same amount of monetary value gives me more of what I want than it could have given me before, but I have to wait.
People have a finite amount of time, and while investing is often useful, it is also nice to be able to take benefits on shorter time spans. Hoarding all your currency instead of having a moderate balance of investing and spending is like being a guy who throws all fun out the window in college and loses hair over the stress in the hopes of being able to relax early for retirement. The other extreme would be throwing all education out the window and dropping out of high school in the hopes of partying continuously. Neither of these are good plans compared to taking a moderate balance of the two. With bitcoin, this means spending some and saving some instead of hoarding every last fraction of a bitcoin.
Also, people need to realize they can exchange for more bitcoin as soon as they make purchases with it without losing any of the benefits. It is good for someone who owns bitcoin to see whether a purchase you'd normally make anyway can be made in bitcoin and then always use bitcoin for those purchases, refilling your bitcoin with the money you'd have normally spent directly on whatever you needed.
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:01:56


You know this oversimplification does not work. It is more realistic to say that not many people accept bitcoin because it is volatile and it is volatile because not many people accept it, so the value is not yet "known". The people that *do* see the long-term promise and take the risks of accepting it directly certainly exist because I've repeatedly made purchases with many of them and these are the ones who help the transitions take place. Once people start to slowly gain confidence and start cautiously approaching bitcoin, this process takes off. It doesn't get locked into one spot because "nobody" accepts it.
