If you plan on holding bitcoin as a long term asset, how do you know when to sell? You don't want to sell before the market fully realizes the possible utility of bitcoin, but it's a totally speculative asset. 
How do we know when bitcoin's value is accurately assessed by the market? Much like Uber, bitcoin as a means of transaction is subject to the size and habits of its user base. What about when the next crypto-currency comes around and you're still locked into bitcoins bought at $600 while the current market has them at $100. Obviously some people are steadfast and will pronounce that an opportunity to buy low and hodl, but if you're planning on cashing out to fiat when it comes to spending your hard earned coins, isn't there always going to be the issue that bitcoin might actually be worth nothing at all?
Does it matter to individual investors? Probably not, but what about other questions like the validity of the market cap? How much of it is owned by how many people?

How many countries have debt denominated in bitcoins? 
Furthermore, bitcoin continues to do appreciate in value, but how many countries want to invest in bitcoin and sit on unrealized capital gains forever, rather than alternative projects that actually grow their gdp? (What about the risk that bitcoin goes to zero? Seems like a greater than 0% probability..)
Finally, HODL is a great motto for people who are sitting on their bitcoins as purely money they can afford to lose, but what if a countries debt gets called in bitcoins at a period of major price fluctuation? 
Bitcoin is currently split between people who want to use it as a speculative investment, (People who change the value by 10% in a day) and people who want to use it as a new form of digital payments. None of that leads me to believe that governments have a need or desire to hold bitcoins.

Can you say with x degree of confidence, that bitcoins will still hold value in fiat money in say, 40 years?

How can he say there's zero risk when bitcoin is clearly vulnerable to massive speculative swings?

Under what circumstances would a government even need/want bitcoins in their central bank reserves, and how likely are those circumstances? (What does bitcoin get them that dollars don't?)
Even if they somehow enabled consumer purchasing through magical internet money, Idk how you even get bitcoins to consumers while keeping them in reserve.  
Second off, why would governments want to "invest" by the long term holding of bitcoins rather than things like infrastructure development and projects to improve overall efficiency, and get cash into the hands of consumers?
