I'd be interested to hear what the Spotify person had to say - if you were to have like a sentence or two summary that'd be super cool. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:18:21
Major thanks! That covers more than 25% of the domain name costs!
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:49:41
Thanks! Hopefully people come for the entertainment value, and then stick around for the entertainment value. Comments/Suggestions are greatly appreciated!
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:01:29
Condense all the memes. Got it!
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:46:54
Drats! You're on to my dastardly plan to get the market to swing wildly while my bots pick up the difference!

Unfortunately I don't have a link. This was something I overheard at the bitcoin conference. 
Pool mined coins are fine as long as the address for the Coinbase transaction is for the person renting the power. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:45:50
Woot! Got ~$3.25 to the tip jar. That's half way to the domain name being taken care of. Awesomesauce.
@_date: 2013-05-29 19:35:08
1% + $0.15
Coinbase fees are very reasonable - just don't be in a hurry. It takes about five business days for the exchange to finalize. You can move up to 50BTC each way per day once your account passes some verification thresholds. 
If you're in a hurry, you can do a cash deposit and payout to Bitcoin address with BitInstant - they're at 3.99% fee; but can only handle up to $1000 deposit per day. 
If you're in a hurry to get a lot exchanged, LocalBitcoins is a good option - though fees can exceed 5%, depending on the person.

I'm unable to cite anything, but from listening to one of the panels I vaguely recall hearing that what was stolen has been parked. Take my memory with a grain of salt.

I'm with  - I snagged a winter special for $30 a year by checking 
I use Cloudflare to take some of the load off my box and cut down on my bandwith costs. It's also great because they spread the caching out over the world so people not in the U.S. should probably get pretty decent initial load. I'm on the free plan right now but don't see the need to go up a tier just yet.
If you're on a Raspberry Pi, definitely check out putting nginx as a caching layer in front of your application - especially if what you're serving is read heavy. Cloudflare uses nginx for their caching, so what I'm doing is really node -&gt; nginx -&gt; nginx.
@_date: 2013-04-23 21:05:23
Exactly. I like what thefuckingweather has - just a single line. The quotes were coming, but I'm digging the idea of rotating some polarizing news articles in there too.
I plan on sifting through the trollbox for some good quotes as well as my own Disqus thread.
@_date: 2013-07-14 20:23:36
I vaguely recall a story of a mining pool that payed 120% - the reason being that some folk wanted 'virgin' coin. The only way to get those coin are from Coinbase transactions. I don't doubt that some people may employ renting hashes as a way of getting coin with this attribute. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:09:06
A few hours ago. TIME TO PANIC BUY! TIME TO PANIC SELL! TIME TO PANIC HOLD! Depending where you're at in the game. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:35:01
Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:24:51
Haha, thanks! Like I said in one of the Disqus comments: "This is what happens when someone has too much time on their hands and is an unemployed developer."
@_date: 2013-04-23 19:30:35
More to the tip jar! Domain name is 75% paid for!
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:18:33
But visually representing it? The only thing that comes to mind for me right now would be ASCII: 1's/0's or alphanumeric garbaldy gook strings. And then that doesn't translate well to a 16px by 16px icon. :/
I am pretty happy with my stenciled Zelda chicken.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:18:54
Sounds like we'd essentially be duplicating the QR code stuff.
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:21:22
The CEO of Expensify has had some good talks on Bitcoin use in business. There are a few videos of him on YouTube "David Barrett". 
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:50:18
Yes. Unmoved since they've been moved out. Again, don't trust what I've heard. I'd search around old bitcointalk threads for a more authoritative answer. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:22:42
I bastardized a pixel art chicken from Zelda. Game. Over.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:35:33
I am not - if you check through the comment threads here though you'll hear the tale of getting the OK from that person.
Thanks for the future tip!

Hey, thanks for the shout out! You sent 97 people my way:

I ***ING LOVE PEOPLE THAT LOVE DOMAIN NAMES!
Thanks a lot! Let me know if there is a particular quip you'd like to see or something to implement. :)
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:34:09
@_date: 2013-04-27 16:56:35
Nah. PHP through Nginx via. PHP-fpm with nginx's caching settings on. So everything with a single nginx. At least for read heavy sites where the data doesn't change much I think it makes sense.
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:01:11
That begs the question, just what the hell is the visual representation of a bitcoin. :P
@_date: 2013-04-23 20:21:30
SWEEET! WITH THAT THE DOMAIN WILL BE PAID FOR! WOOT!
If you have an idea for a quip let me know and I'll make it so.
@_date: 2013-01-04 03:38:21
I'm a Quality Assurance developer at Grooveshark, but I do graphic work on the side. I don't typically do branding but I'd enjoy taking a stab at it for fun. Would you mind providing some examples of stuff you like and some more information about what you're selling? If you'd like a portfolio I could PM some stuff I've done. I'd be looking for 2-4BTC for my time if you like what I come up with. If you don't like it, NBD, don't pay. I'd be doing it more for fun.
@_date: 2013-04-23 15:39:31
Thanks greatly appreciated! If you've got any tips or thoughts on things to make it better or funnier please let me know!
@_date: 2013-04-26 21:01:03
It's a nice bar, though they do care about appearances. I was dressed somewhat less than to the nines and almost didn't get in. Thankfully I was hanging with the Bitinstant folk that night.
I got a Gin and Tonic for the equivalent of $7 USD at the time. I made use of the Coinbase Android app, so my payment was as simple as scanning a QR code. I realize now that I didn't tip the guy that made my drink, I was all caught up in the moment. :(
CNN or MSNBC or CNBC, one of those folks were there recording while I got the drink. If anyone knows where that may have aired I'd be interested - I've only seen the news stories.
I suppose I could do a mini I Am A person that was there the day before the $260 crash.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:04:08
Done. Though Coinbase is going to have to wait until tonight.
@_date: 2013-04-23 17:05:42
FUCKING AINT NOBODY GOT TIME FOR THAT 
Thanks, yeah - any suggestions for what of? A little BTC logo is tired, something to convey something funny. How about a chicken?
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:23:30
HELLA FUCKING YES
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:15:51
I probably won't get to it until later this evening. The dev environment I have is total rookie right now - I need to put this under version control and setup a staging environment. I've been editing from the hip so far. :P
@_date: 2013-04-23 18:45:48
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:20:35
You can basically copy/paste what I have then. Mt.Gox seems to be pretty open with their streaming websocket API, check the link at the bottom of the page if you haven't already.
Put this script tag at the top:
    &lt;script src=" type="text/javascript"&gt;
And then just this:
    var conn = io.connect('
    conn.on('message', function(data) {
      //console.warn('message', data);
      if (data.channel_name &amp;&amp; data.channel_name=='ticker.BTCUSD' &amp;&amp; data.ticker.last.display_short) {  
          console.log(data.ticker.last.display_short);
    }});
ticker.last.display_short is what you're probably interested in displaying on the page - and you can do that with pure javascript or jquery by putting that value in some other tag in the DOM.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:36:17
Makes sense. Unfortunately, I've become quite attached to my shitty hand traced pixel chicken. Also, I'm pretty lazy.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:52:01
Roger. Added to my notepad for tonight!

Ask and you shall receive! Chicken Arise!
@_date: 2013-04-23 23:15:05
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:09:39
Haha, yeah - that's exactly the plan. I'm taking some time now combing the interwebs for good BTC related quips to work in this evening. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:02:53
This isn't that event. The difficulty change has to do with how hard it is for the miners to earn the current 25 BTC reward per block.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:22:42
I tried to use the Coinbase button, but it seems that they were having some CDN issues when I last tried. I'll give 'em a go later tonight.
I think it makes sense to keep the old fashioned hash visible but make it a link supporting MultiBit, and then have the button do Coinbase - yeah?
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:44:52
I've played with meteor; honestly, using any library is too big for what I'm doing here. I can get away with straight JS and even remove jQuery if I wanted to. (though I think that's unnecessary because most folk's browsers probably already have one cached from Google's CDN)
Part of the fun I had here was being as minimal as I can. When I get to the rewrite this evening I already know I can strip tonnes of CSS from the HTML5 Boilerplate I copied over. As well as cleanup the rats nest of javascript and html.
The other part of the fun I had here was using Node. Being mostly experienced with JS I'm sad I waited until now to play with it. I've got Node going through caching Nginx, and then Cloudflare in front of that. I think I should be able to handle a relatively high load for a $30/yr. VPS.
I am thinking of doing some better charts/graphs - so when I do that I'll be looking at things like D3.
The back-end source code is on pastebin: 
It's pretty light.
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:15:12
Yeah, I've thought about that.
What I ended up thinking, and this is something I'd expect to shit out writing an art paper, but the idea of the price being fixed when you hit the page is a lot like how people buy in to bitcoin. They start at a point, and that's the pivot point they assess things from. 
Another reason I'm justifying it post-hoc is that I think the 'interestingness' of the BUY/SELL would decrease - it would more often spend about half it's time on one side or the other. Looking up from your screen to the tab bar you just see buy/sell - but with it fixed you have different info that it's been above / below your point.
The bigger reason is that I'm pretty lazy and doing a moving average would have taken more than 30 seconds. :P I think most people that want that right now could handle refreshing the page.
Still, definitely something I'm considering. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:05:52
I did actually e-mail the operator of thefuckingweather beforehand to get their blessing. 
The subject of my e-mail was "CAN WE BE FUCKING FRIENDS?". 
Their reply: "I suppose I can't make all of the FUCKING websites". 
Edit for formatting
@_date: 2013-04-26 19:39:11
You may be able to not have to use varnish by just using the caching capabilities of nginx. If so, that's one less moving part and one less thing taking up RPi resources. It might even help with response time because there'd be one less layer for data to hop across. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 14:14:57
PANIC BUY
@_date: 2013-05-26 03:48:45
I don't know how hard set y'all are on Spotify, but I think you might have a better chance asking Grooveshark. I think the Grooveshark team is a bit nimbler in terms of implementing this sort of thing. (Caveat, I am a former Grooveshark employee)
@_date: 2013-04-23 22:50:18
Ah, I follow. Surprisingly, that's probably harder to explain to someone looking at it than a chicken. Ha.
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:11:21
Haha! Nice little easter egg huh.
@_date: 2013-04-24 00:22:14
Great scott. That's the most cringeworthy pun I've heard since I watched this pun competition video. 
@_date: 2013-04-23 16:03:26
Ah! Solid idea. I'm toying with turning on the Disqus monetization options, but I think most of the ad crap there is going to be shit.
I think some links to Bitcoin resources is a capital idea. And with that sort of layout I can still do something responsive with my CSS and it'll reflow nicely on mobile devices.
@_date: 2013-04-24 02:05:39
Ha ha, that'd defeat the purpose of my [dastardly scheme](
