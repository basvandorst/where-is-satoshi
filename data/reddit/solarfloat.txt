Well for one, stop printing money that isn't tied to any actual value. Creating more money out of thin air doesn't solve problems. I'd think of all places, would understand this.

It solves problems for about a month until suddenly everyone can afford $1000 higher rent payments, so landlords increase everyone's rent by $1000 because *somebody* will be willing to pay it, and now we're back where we started. It's almost like people don't understand how inflation works.

Repeat after me: past performance is not indicative of future results.

I have two cats and have had many cats over my lifetime. If they’re clever they take off the whole collar.
It’s probably not intentional but cats are supposed to have breakaway collars because they’re always jumping up on stuff and squeezing through things and the collar could get caught. I’m not sure exactly how they do it, but collars with bells never last more than a week on my cats.

Yeah nothing says "deadly force" like your buddy helping you stage your stunt for social media.

If the entire planet lost electricity the most valuable metals would become copper, lead, and brass.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:08:27
Oh okay so it's unreasonable to assume that the guy pushing them off was staged but also unreasonable to assume that was part of the "prank"?
Anyway, it was an *escal*ator.

Most of the world's currency doesn't even exist in physical form.

Not necessarily. Hodling just means not *selling* and trying to collect as much Bitcoin as you can. The original post where the term was first used was strictly talking about trading.  [ 
I've never heard any serious Bitcoin enthusiast say to never spend Bitcoin.

If more companies allowed or encouraged jobs where people could work from home, we could spread out a lot more. The main reason populations are more dense in certain areas is because most people don't want to spend more than an hour or two a day driving to and from work. If more people could work from home it would alleviate traffic and reduce pollution as well. It's a win for everyone but employers are afraid they can't micromanage the shit out of their employees that way to prevent time theft.

The point is eventually the cat finds a way to take off the bell.
@_date: 2019-10-21 14:36:42
Not sure what you mean but my point was that copper, lead, and brass are used to make bullets.

Hey hey heeeeyyyyyyy

Don't try to time the market. 
Don't use high interest debt (like a credit card) to invest.
Invest what you can afford to lose, and invest smaller amounts periodically to average out your cost basis, rather than dumping a whole bunch of money into it.
Hope for the best, prepare for the worst.
Essentially, play the long game, don't try to make money on short-term trades.

The recession is completely speculative.

Gonna go out on a limb here and say you’re probably not from America?
@_date: 2019-10-15 23:53:40
That would be an interesting feat of balance

Bitcoin is not a product. It’s not owned by any one person or company, so who would sue?
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:05:27
Relative to what start point exactly?

The two are not mutually exclusive. Spend and replace whenever possible. Some places will give you a discount for using Bitcoin, so it’s worth it.
@_date: 2019-10-13 19:03:47
Literally just a few weeks ago it was at 10,000 and has been stuck between 8000 and 8500 ever since. I’ve been investing in Bitcoin since 2014 and this sure doesn’t seem like a bull run to me.
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:27:25
Spend and replace.

Why is there even a template for that meme? All it should ever really say is “It’s over 9000!”
@_date: 2019-10-12 20:01:44
I suspect a lot of people still don’t know this which leads to a lot of misunderstanding of how Bitcoin could actually be used as a currency.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:23:01
Don't forget the one going from 32 cents to $1.

How could anyone prove that if nobody owns the symbol? It’s essentially the same as if someone made a piece of art that used the dollar symbol.

Nah, you guys went from talking about buying Bitcoin on a high-interest credit card to talking about buying bitcoin with a 0% APR introductory rate and then putting money in a savings account.
@_date: 2019-10-11 16:14:25
Most people are bad with finances. Don't be like most people.
@_date: 2019-10-16 17:19:49
When everyone who owns one bitcoin is a millionaire.
@_date: 2019-10-16 13:45:30
How is it not? You still have the same amount of bitcoin, you're just contributing to its intended use as well.
@_date: 2019-10-15 13:01:32
Wait where did those goalposts just go? They were right here a second ago...

Fees don't depend only on the amount of the transaction though. If that $80 was made up of 500 different input transactions, your fee would be a bit higher.
