These stupid articles being posted here make bitcoin seem extremely childish and only serve to drag crypto currencies down. Grow the fuck up. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:07:39
In hindsight it is real easy to dredge up two articles and pretend like you were smart and knew all along. Grow the fuck up.

So basically what you are saying is that if you want to get into bitcoin as a crypto currency then you need to spend a year doing research? Right.. Sounds like a wonderful alternative to fiat money. Cyrpto currency sounds so amazing if all you need is a years worth of research to hopefully not get ripped off. God you fucking people that blame victims for being victims in the first place have no idea how stupid you sound.

I just think that from the outside looking in, for over 2 years now, I still feel like bitcoin is too risky. People seem to get ripped off regardless of how much research they do. You make one mistake and it is gone before you know it. I see way too many people on their high horse blaming the victims, but there is no reason for a crypto currency to succeed if it truly takes a year of research to be safe. 
I like the concept of crypto currencies, but I hate how people seem to blame victims and sweep the bad shit under the rug. All I think is that the people that do this are greedy shit mongers that just want to speculate the currency, ride the wave, then dump everything. They know they have to sweep all the bad shit under the rug and tell everyone that everything is fine and only idiots get fucked over. It certainly doesn't change my mind about the current viability of any valuable crypto currency.

I've never used Gox. Nice assumption. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 10:43:49
Wow, you really are bragging about searching info on Mt Gox just now and finding out it is a bad idea or was your reply poorly worded?
I know I certainly get the majority of my investment advice by asking google questions. Google, should I invest in VTIAX or VIMSX? Google, should I short TWTR? Google, FNMA has been investigated for fraud in the past, short or long?
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:28:55
Blatantly false. Your very first sentence prefaced that items that everyone should have know would lead to being ripped off and that included the prerequisite that you have been involved with bitcoin for at least a year.

What the hell are you talking about? First of all, the bank will eat fraudulent spending and they have in my case. Someone passed on my wife's credit card number to someone in Spain and pulled out $4k. Our bank ate that charge after us merely reporting it to them on the phone, no hassle at all. Who would the retailer be in that case? They pulled out cash, not made a purchase. Either way, I use a credit card for fraud protection. The bottom line is that there are consumer protections in place that absolutely do not exist for a crypto currency.
A proven track record means nothing? Why am I even arguing with you? Either you just made one of the worlds dumbest statements or we all better prepare for the end of civilized society as the entire world economy is on the brink of collapse.

Seems extremely accusatory to me or else poorly worded if that was indeed NOT your intention.  
@_date: 2014-02-21 11:22:02
I think a lot of people figured that they pushed more volume than any other exchange and ended up pushing the limits of their system. I really think the root problem is that so many people used Gox and it usually is a good sign when a company is so popular. This is why I don't think anyone was actually stupid for using them until their most recent, serious problems. 
The other exchanges I [researched]( also had reports of serious security vulnerabilities and serious incidents.
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:05:20
We know this now, but there are a lot of people on here that didn't see any of this coming. It is easy in hindsight to pretend like everyone knew just like it is easy to say we all knew that bitcoin would blow up to the price it did. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:08:54
FDIC. Proven track record. Banks eating fraudulent credit card charges rather than the customer. What a joke right?
It is not perfect, but you are smoking crack if you think that bitcoin can somehow compete with USD in its current state. I hope it eventually can, but as of right now your statement is absolutely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:56:55
I haven't invested any money in bitcoin. Why does everyone assume I must have lost money because I am pointing out that it is kind of fucked how the community acts when other people get fucked? It seems kind of childish to react like that. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:37:36
I've never used Mt. Gox before. I don't even own any bitcoins. My point is basically what your point is. Bitcoins and any valuable crypto currencies in general are definitely not even close to prime time at the moment. To me it is fun to follow crypto currencies. I honestly could see them not living up to expectations ever unless there is some form of government backing. The solution has yet to emerge to make it truly viable, but it is interesting to watch and see what develops and possibly in the future these problems with crypto currencies are tackled, possibly without the help of government.

I posted one meme that took me 5 seconds to create from a website. Not only that, but you made a dumbass assumption like a bunch of other people suffering from severe butthurtness. I don't own any bitcoin. I don't play with Magic Cards. That means I've never used Gox, ever. If only you weren't such a dumbass. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:03:00
I haven't lost anything. I am just fed up with all of the 8th graders on bitcoin to the point where I am just about to the realization that there is no future in bitcoin with such a shitty community of people. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:26:45
[Right on](

I figured it was just poorly worded. I personally have not used an exchange. I almost did about 6 months ago, but at the time, I found negative reviews for every single exchange that was recommended on this sub. It is a huge reason why I just never felt safe enough to go through with a purchase. Today is a completely different story with all the new exchanges popping up. The thing is, you will find that almost any institution that deals with money is going to be sued, investigated, have bad reviews. Even good businesses will run into these problems. Mt. Gox was easily the most talked about exchange on this sub for the longest time before the recent freeze. I really don't buy all these people telling me they knew from two articles on google that it was going to turn into a complete scam. It is easy to sound smart after the fact. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:31:51
People that are newer to bitcoin see that the exchange with the highest price was Mt. Gox, which also easily had the most buzz in the community, and that would almost lead people to believe that it must therefore be the most safe and trust worthy to warrant the increase in price. All of this bullshit discussion in this thread revolves around a bunch of pompous assholes claiming they are basically clairvoyant and saw this coming. Good for them. I hope that keeps working for them. For the rest of us, it is not so easy to see things like this coming before it is too late. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 19:39:57
Haha, no you are wrong. I don't really want to argue with you. Your arguments are way too dumb. Retailers don't eat credit card fraud. I don't know why you think that, plus it's a moot point considering it changes nothing about consumer protection. You might be thinking of charge backs, which is completely unrelated to the fraud I am talking about. Please stop talking like you are so cocksure about this because you can educated yourself by using google before your open you mouth on the subject. 
Uh 2008, the USD did not collapse. Not sure what your problem is here considering I already listed FDIC. As long as you split your money up in banks to not exceed $250k, you didn't lose your money. The US was not bailed out. Some companies where bailed out, but this wasn't preventing a collapse of the US economy, just trying to steer it away from austerity. I seriously cannot argue with you, you will pull anything out of your ass that makes zero sense considering the context of the argument. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:04:03
I'm replying to someone that stated you need a year of research because obviously that sounds ridiculous. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:04:57
I liked how you dodged the bullet of admitting you basically said that as long as you had a year under your belt, you would be all but immune to being ripped off by an online exchange. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 09:39:27
I don't own any bitcoin, but I do invest heavily in the stock market. You are completely ignorant to how investing works if you think that a company having some issues is always going to turn into a complete fucking scam. Your post is a joke. 
@_date: 2014-04-13 18:34:42
What an ignorant answer. Made me laugh out loud. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 12:00:41
I guess I came to this sub on different days than you. People had problems with every single exchange. People could also be found touting the virtues of every single exchange. Everyone had plenty of examples of why it was a dumb idea to keep your coins anywhere but a cold wallet unless you where actively trading and that truth is definitely clear. But Gox didn't really show any hint of what it has recently become. They just seemed to stumble from such large volume.
