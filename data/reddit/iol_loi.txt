Nothing says hacking like a command prompt running ping.

**Why would the price dip if BIP148 passes?**
It resolves a long standing issue with BTC and makes it more viable than it already is AFAIK.
Leading up to BIP148 we may see no changes in price (because it's locked in or the market doesn't care), an increase (because people see that BIP148 is good for the longevity of BTC), or a decrease (because people are scared and unsure of what will happen).
No one can tell you for sure. Look at the halvening. So many people thought we were going to the moon after it and that leading up to it we'd see a huge drop off. Neither happened. Price was basically locked in/market didn't care.
The market at this point, is a bunch of whales moving it around via cascade events regardless of news.

Bears will tell you no.  
Bulls will tell you yes.
If you have long term faith in crypto and you are assuming you can't touch that money for a year, probably a good time to buy.

Anyone want to clarify Greg's comments? Are both versions bad?

Seriously, everyone should go fork themselves. Just fork off already.

Worst case scenario, BIP91 activates, Jihan doesn't signal for segwit, chain split, and... clusterfuck? He's got a fuck ton of mining power behind him. So that makes it worrisome. But does it result in a true catastrophe?

Gold would still have manufacturing value.
Gold would still exist after a global catastrophe.
Bitcoin is digital fiat, with nothing to back it's value aside from the will of the people. I will still prefer bitcoin over cash though.

You only lose money when you sell right now. As long as you hold, you're not in a loss yet.
I bought just before the MTGOX crash, it took a while to get back to parity. I know those feels. Just sit tight.

This guy calculates his 1060s:
That's assuming current growth rates and that Vega and Volta don't wreck the mining scene with crazy performance/price.
Also, gtfo of the bitcoin sub with this, bitcoin is ASIC.

Oh I've spent some of mine over the years, but I also treat some of it as an investment.
