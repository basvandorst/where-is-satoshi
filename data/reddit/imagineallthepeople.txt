Ah man, if you played against me ever you hated me. I knew every wall glitch/connection hack in that game. Pretty sure I discovered new ones too. My whole clan was into that. Disconnecting the ethernet during certain actions and reconnecting after the right amount of time would often render you invisible/indestructable muahah. So many good times getting under the submarine and into houses and killing people with rpg afterburn...not sorry I was 10 and it was great! m14 always!
Edit: or the SD semi sniper !

Stopped by their BTC teller to chat with the guys, they're running this little machine to hopefully spread awareness and access to BTC, they were also giving away free paper wallets (mine was preloaded with 2.9 mBTC! Woo) 
So I officially own my first fraction of a bitcoin, after all this time and it actually feels pretty cool! Even though it's about $2
Edit: units

Tell me more about this 'simple wallhack'
Edit: oh man do you mean like in Socom II, glitching into the walls?

That's very interesting. I'm familiar with security on a very amateur basis, but played enough MMO's since the early 2000s to have a general sense of danger/safety re:computers and the internet. Would you know off hand anywhere to start reading up on the more technical aspects of security today? 
I've done "Hello, world"s in 3 or 4 languages and handcrafted a derivative calculator in python, and done some scripting in LUA but I feel like a more in depth knowledge of security is necessary, so any sites or sources would go a long way. I read tech articles as often as possible and try and find the niftiest gadgets, so yeah - sorry for the ramble but I'm intrigued

Gotcha - thanks.
