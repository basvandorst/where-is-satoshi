Maybe the demand for BTC would shrink in the US and Europe, but what about the rest of the world? Do you really not see a scenario in which Bitcoin greatly appreciates as the dollar and euro plummet? You forget that even without speculation, Bitcoin is great at storing value. The dollar is currently highly valuable around the world for the same reason.

Great explanation. I didn't know about the default setting for opening channels, but it certainly makes sense and will likely go a long way to avoid centralization.
@_date: 2018-01-23 18:58:33
Because it takes time to build a robust decentralized network. Hence why Bitcoin's adoption has taken years. People release new alts that promise the moon and more all the time, but no other network comes close to Bitcoin in terms of adoption, and therefore, reliability and security.

You're confusing liquidity with supply, so your whole analysis is wrong. The only thing LN does is massively increase liquidity, which makes price discovery easier. The effect on the price would be more stability with less swings but not, as you described, a "massive supply" increase that would cause the price to drop.

Honestly, it's a pretty common misconception. I'm a software engineer myself and it took me a minute after reading a couple articles about the LN to get it.

I think you're overestimating the promises these alts make. For instance, more or different algorithms does not mean better security.
I also think claiming that other cryptocurrencies have "less centralization" and "10x more nodes" is dubious at best.

Block size limit wouldn't help reduce fees. You should read more about this. The transaction throughput increase would be countered in greater measure by the bandwidth bottleneck, since blocks that are twice as big would require twice as much network capacity. The people claiming that a block size limit increase is a solution are naive at best, and acting in bad faith at worst.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:06
Increasing the block size limit is not a scaling solution. It's a naive idea that would never actually work in practice because it doesn't make the network more efficient in any way. Bandwidth is the biggest bottleneck in the network, and increasing the block size does nothing to improve this. Any increase in transactions throughput would be offset by the increased cost of block propagation (double the size means you need double the bandwidth).
So you can quit this nonsense about how everything would be solved if only Core and the community would fold to this ridiculous proposal.

The only way what you're saying works is if you also double the network capacity on a global scale. Which is obviously impossible. If you seriously think there is no additional overhead to increasing block sizes and keeping everything else the same, you don't understand how networks work. At all.

That's not because SW doesn't work for all transactions.

SW is not the bullshit, your naive, uninformed and entitled attitude is.
@_date: 2017-12-22 22:49:22
Your explanation does nothing to address why increasing the block sizes would not consume more bandwidth.
The process you're describing happens regardless of what the block size is. But increasing that size would mean more data in transit, hence more bandwidth needed.

@_date: 2017-12-23 18:16:34
Deflation simply means the money supply decreases, or it stays constant while the rest of goods and services supply increases.
In a long-term scenario in which Bitcoin achieves world-wide recognition, the supply for it while remain relatively constant (with minor increases at a fixed, measurable rate). Contrary to what you read on whatever journal, this is good for the economy, not bad.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:53
And despite that, confirming transactions takes about an hour or so. Whatever the overall global network capacity is doesn't matter, and is very difficult to measure. The point is that the network is already operating at full capacity, and doubling the block sizes would only double the burden that it'd have to bear.
@_date: 2018-09-17 01:27:47
You’re flat out wrong and you don’t understand the first thing about Bitcoin. Bitcoin is PoW. It’s not good in spite of it. Bitcoin without PoW does not work. It’s like saying computers are failing to live up to their potential because of their electricity consumption or their binary signal system.

Again, I don't see how that'd have added any value to the Windows phones. What could they offer that Google's ecosystem didn't already do better? I guess at one point they could have leveraged Office to their advantage, but even then, would that be enough to drive people away from cheaper phones with Google Docs? Nowadays you can get Office on almost any device anyway, as MS realized they needed to catch up to Google Docs, so even if they'd gotten on the cloud bandwagon earlier with Office, I don't think that'd have been enough to save Windows phones. And if not Office, what could they possibly offer? Internet Explorer? Skype?

Nope. Control of the money supply is set a fixed rate by an algorithm. The algorithm can be changed, but only by willful consent of the majority of nodes. Sure, some of the early adopters got to rake in a bunch of coins on the cheap, but so what? Sorry to break it to you, the point isn't to distribute wealth equally, but simply to fix the problems of bad monetary policy.

This makes absolutely no sense. If blocks are twice as big that's double the bandwidth burden for propagating them, therefore double the time it takes to confirm any given transaction.
Saying that the bandwidth is the same regardless of block size flat out wrong.
@_date: 2018-09-05 21:24:29
Those coins don't have greater efficiency in any meaningful way. What they have is much lower transaction demand and a whole lot of empty promises. One look at their respective "papers" reveals the obvious problem: they sacrifice decentralization in a bid to gain throughput, despite decentralization and censorship-resistance being the entire point of Bitcoin. A cryptocurrency that doesn't put decentralization above all else is just a worse PayPal.

No, that's completely wrong, and you've just shown your own ignorance. Increasing the block size limit while maintain every thing else in the network the same would be a huge overhead. If you can't understand this, you need to learn the basics of how networks operate.

@_date: 2017-12-22 04:53:11
Bitcoin is designed as trustless payment system. In order to achieve this, it uses a mechanism known as Proof-of-work to confirm transactions in de-centralized way, that requires no single third-party to confirm payments. The POW algorithm is expensive and slow; **this is by design** to ensure that the network of computers that verify the transactions have a stake in the system, big enough that it wouldn't make any economical sense for them to act in bad faith (for instance by double-spending money or otherwise cheating the system). People tend to forget this little tidbit when discussing "scalability".
So, we'd all like to be able to use Bitcoin for regular transactions. The problem is, part of confirming a transaction requires not only the proof-of-work, but also broadcasting the confirmed transaction to the network. In other words, it's not enough for one miner to verify your payment by finding the correct hash; they have to make sure the rest of the network knows about this. This takes a lot of time due to the limited bandwidth available worldwide.
At this point, the misinformed people who support the idea of increasing the block size limit will tell you that this is the only solution to this problem. The reasoning is intuitive, but naive: if you can fit more transactions per block, you'll reduce the number of blocks needed, therefore making transactions more likely to confirm and fees cheaper. This is completely wrong, because increasing the block size would only increase the bandwidth requirements for confirming a block. So in practical terms, going from 2MB to 4MB blocks would double the time it takes to confirm transactions. If this sounds like it doesn't actually solve anything, that's because it doesn't, hence why the Core devs have always refused to do this pointless hack.
One real solution that the team is working on is called the Lightning Network. The gist of it is this: instead of confirming every single transaction on the Bitcoin blockchain directly (which is expensive and takes time, again, *by design*), transactions can be done without requiring proof-of-work on a second decentralized layer, and then eventually committing the balance at some point into the blockchain. The details are fairly technical, and I don't have a good analogy to explain how it really works, so you'll have to do your own research on this one.

But not the underlying protocol. At this point, you're just being thick for the sake of arguing. If a company comes along and makes a product that works by using the LN, that's a great innovation. It does nothing to compromise the integrity of Bitcoin, because it won't even touch the blockchain.

For real, how much are they paying you to spout this obviously untrue garbage? The only measure by which any of these project's code is "cleaner" is their lack of contributions. And the only measure by which their infrastructure is "designed properly" is if the goal is to get rid of everything that makes Bitcoin work in the first place. There's no free lunch, if you give up the qualities that allow for truly decentralized, deterministic, provable consensus, you have to offer something in return. What these alts offer is nothing more than glorified trusted third parties in the form of "trusted nodes".
@_date: 2017-12-22 01:31:49
Except that's completely different. Exchanges have little power over the network, as we saw with the trainwreck that was S2X. Not to mention any savvy holder would know it's best to keep their coins in their own privately controlled wallet.
More importantly, on the global scheme, exchanges are anything but centralized. Sure, most countries have one or two exchanges at most, but you can always trade directly with anyone on the planet.
Exchanges are glorified auction houses, nothing more.

At small volumes, sure. But if we're talking manipulation at a significant scale, you can't do it for free.


Might be true for shitcoins, though you obviously don't have the data to back any of this up. Neither do I, but I'm not the one making these dubious claims. At any rate, Bitcoin would be less prone to this as the volume needed to manipulate the price would be much higher, so the comparison against alts is even more relevant, not less.

Nope. I have no clue why you're even claiming this, or where you got this idea. The LN does not require larger blocks for anything. That does not even make any sense.
And as I've been telling you over and over, increasing the block size won't do anything to lower the fees.

And the whole of this post is comparing market dominance/preference for one coin over the other. Low volume means low popularity, simple as that.

Bud, I've been spending all night arguing this point, so I'm sorry for sounding snippy: bigger blocks won't lower fees, won't scale Bitcoin in the short, medium or long term, and won't solve anything at all. Doubling the block size would double the bandwidth burden for propagating blocks within the network, therefore double the time it takes to confirm transactions, and thus removing any possible benefit of having twice as much transaction throughput.

What the hell does this have to do with Bitcoin's ability to survive? Do you really think fiat is harder to steal?


Again, you're starting from the false premise that money needs to be equally distributed for Bitcoin to succeed. Not everyone will ever own a whole Bitcoin. That's not a bug in the protocol, it's just the economic environment we live in.
Sure, if your parameter for Bitcoin success is wether it can solve income inequality, then no, Bitcoin will never be successful. But that's never been the point. The point is to have a global payments network no single government can tamper with. If you can't see the obvious advantage of that over fiat you're not thinking outside the box.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:23:52
SegWit is the "shot-term solution" that people have been clamoring for. It was an update to increase the block size limit to 2MB (twice as much as before) and make transactions take up less space, therefore making the network much more efficient.
The long-term solution is the lightning network. Essentially, instead of committing every single transaction into Bitcoin immediately, as is done today, most transactions would be done within a second layer network, where no proof-of-work is required. Proof-of-work is an expensive, resource intensive process *by design* to ensure the Bitcoin blockchain is secure, tamper proof and trustless. However, this also means it is *slow by design*. With the second layer Lightning Network, large transactions volumes could potentially be confirmed as fast as credit card Visa transactions, while still leveraging the features of Bitcoin (security, resiliency and trustless) by *eventually* committing the balances to it.
That's my attempt at a very short explanation, and I'm sure I glossed over many important details, so feel free to ask more.
@_date: 2018-09-21 22:53:45

That's a good point: it's far easier to write down something that *sounds* better on paper, on a very high-level, that's easy to parse. It's far more difficult to actually understand the concepts behind Bitcoin to a deep enough level that you can understand the ins and outs of its strengths and shortcomings, let alone actually writing a detailed proposal for how to improve upon it.
Every single one of these alt-coins falls short of the latter. They really, *really* nail the first part: making up a high-level concept that sounds amazing. Take Ethereum for instance: it's not hard to come up with the basic idea of "It's like Bitcoin but you can run programs on it, so you can have any kind of smart contract you want. It's also more efficient and centralized because it has PoS." In reality, though, PoS is a pipe dream at best, and a major potential vulnerability at worst. Supporting program execution on top of a decentralized PoW system opens the door to a million potential vulnerabilities and bloating which can and will ultimately bring down the whole network.
It turns out, solving the problems of Bitcoin is *fucking hard*, and all these people claiming to have a better solution have yet to give credible proof. Because if they did actually invent something that improved upon Bitcoin, someone would just add it as a contribution to the Bitcoin repository. See the Lightning Network and SegWit.

Probably not, since the market is still correcting after the last bull run. There's a chance it might, driven by LN or some unforeseen event like getting SEC approval for Bitcoin in ETFs early.

In this context it is, because the central topic is whether Bitcoin is the most secure, the most scalable, and the most decentralized solution. Going back to the original comment that sparked this thread, the poster was just blabbing about how Bitcoin doesn't actually have any of this properties, which comes off as ridiculously uninformed.
Also, the question originally wasn't posed as "How is Bitcoin secured?" but as an assertion that Bitcoin does not have a guarantee of 100% security, ergo it has bad security. Hence my hostile tone.

This right here. It's really hard for most people to grasp just how deep this goes. Many people come here to post shit like "pshh, as if the US dollar/government/economy would ever collapse" or "why would anyone need that much security for their cash", followed by "just use a bank". It's astounding because people are so used to placing their entire faith in these institutions that *could actually collapse* (unlikely as it seems at the moment when everything is fine). Then they go and point out the price variance of Bitcoin as "proof that it can crash", as if the USD wasn't just as vulnerable to the whims of the market. At least Bitcoin is tamper proof; trusting any government to always be responsible with their fiat's supply is the real case of hopeful thinking.

@_date: 2018-05-31 20:41:57
I understand your point now, and you're right. We shouldn't be obsessing over the idea of "low transaction fees". But it's good to highlight this nonetheless because of the whole big-blocker nonsense about how "Core is trying to kill Bitcoin with high transaction fees". Specially when post-SW transaction fees are way lower than BCash.
@_date: 2018-05-30 17:52:11
I don't get why you say this is anything but a good thing. If we assume the price is driven by adoption (a fairly strong assumption to be fair, but one which has held true for years) then low transaction fees can only be good since they encourage adoption. The block reward halving is inevitable regardless of what the average transaction fee or what the current price in USD is. How would the (inevitable and expected) prospect of decreased mining profitability be any better with high transaction fees?

@_date: 2018-05-14 22:48:42


Nothing exists in a vacuum, and so the only way to measure the performance of Bitcoin is to compare it with alternatives. Good luck getting any certainty of security from fiat which is subject to inflation and is falsified on a regular basis. No other commodity in history has even come close to Bitcoin's security.
Likewise, no other alt has proven itself through the sheer amount of events shaking the network the way Bitcoin has.
Nothing is guaranteed. You think "solving" these problems means that you'll someday have a 100% certainty for any of these, but that is simply not the case and is unlikely to be possible from a practical perspective.
Also, betting your life savings on Bitcoin is ridiculous, regardless.

Thanks for that last link, I actually learned something new today.
I think the scenario dubbed a feather fork is interesting and worth considering, but isn't something that is actually economically feasible. It strikes me as a less efficient version of a contentious hard fork.
In the "feather fork", the attacker has to broadcast their intent and target in order to be successful, with the expectation that other miners will find it more profitable to follow along. In the event that altruistic nodes start rejecting blocks verified by the attacker, a hard fork would occur, leaving the attacker with a worthless (or at least much less profitable) alt chain. This altruistic nodes solution could be implemented as an update to the Bitcoin Core client.
In the end, the attacker would be better off just cutting out the middle part and going for a chain split, without explicitly exposing themselves as a malicious entity in the process. This has been attempted multiple times with varying degrees of success. See Bitcoin Cash, Bitcoin Unlimited, Bitcoin Gold, etc.
@_date: 2018-05-14 23:11:08
This is the kind of shitty logic that only the most pernicious nay sayers can trap themselves in. Large scale adoption does not equal replacing all forms of money. It means becoming a direct competitor to Fiat currencies across the globe. The transition is already happening, with countries who are most vulnerable to the problems of fiat (e.g. Venezuela) desperately seek to move over to better alternatives like Bitcoin. Every day that Bitcoin increases in adoption, the value increases, and the probability of it falling out of favor decreases by virtue of how the market works: as more people become aware of it and its properties, more people will consider a valuable store of value, therefore more people will want to trade for it, therefore it comes closer to being a widespread currency.
@_date: 2018-05-31 20:53:15
There's no such thing as normal payments, because all payments are the same in a free market (guess what Bitcoin is?). Being able to pay someone for X thing doesn't make it more or less likely that you'll be able to pay for Y thing.

Well technically we did. Industrialization began over a century before fiat currencies were introduced.

I always wonder how you neoliberals think markets and economies worked before the invention of fiat.

@_date: 2017-08-15 03:46:53
I think that's a very near-sighted mentality. Even from an investors' perspective, it's essentially just status quo bias.
Historically, yes, the USD has been and is still one of the most stable currencies, hence it's popularity. But that doesn't guarantee that it will continue to be the case. Hell, the 2009 global recession should pretty much be a warning of what happens when countries and businesses put too much faith in a single fiat currency.
Similarly, look at the US stock market. Again, historically, it's been a great way to invest your money, with high average growth rates. But the first thing about investment is that nothing is guaranteed. And current trends show historically low ROI rates on the stock market. You might argue it's just trends that come and go, but that's where Bitcoin is different. It's not a bond, it's not fiat, it's not stocks, it's better than any of those things. It's being able to trade on a global, secure, non-inflationary currency, that you can carry around with you in your pocket.
So, on the one hand, you got the good old dollar, which is probably not going away anytime soon, but it's also not bringing anything new to the table, and has already shown some wear. Bitcoin surpasses any type of currency that's ever been used, so as more people learn about it, it will naturally gain adoption as it's more convenient, safer, and over the long term, more stable than any fiat currency. Yes, including the USD.
Bitcoin can't possibly fail not because the idea is good. The tech is great, it's the future, but we're now at a point were BTC is actually traded for goods and services. Let that sink in, there's now a growing network of merchants that will take your BTCs. There's also a huge network of miners who've collectively invested billions, and will continue to do so, guaranteeing the security of your coins.
BTC's tech is good, but the community around it is what drives it further, and that is the real guarantee that it will succeed.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:28:33
Why does it have to turn into a religious debate? There are real technical challenges, as well as practical ones, facing all cryptocurrencies. But instead of studying and proposing tangible solutions, it seems like people defending BCH are just spouting ignorant non-arguments like this.
Who cares what anyone believes is "the true bitcoin"? What does that even mean? Are you investing because you believe cryptocurrencies like bitcoin are a practical solution to the problems of the future, or because you support some vague ideology?
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:31:14
This is blatant misinformation. BCH is a bubble, it's vulnerable to insidious manipulation and was deliberately designed as such. Representing it as a fair or competitive alternative is naively misguided at best, and willfully malicious at worst, because it is neither.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:10:48
I don't see how that would work out at all in BCH's favor. Dropping mining from BTC in the long run will simply open the door for non-Chinese, non-subsidized competition from other countries for mining BTC blocks. The coin is not going to drop in value unless there were absolutely 0 transactions being verified and 0 blocks being mined. At that point, anyone could run a full-node on their own home-tier hardware and mine their high-value reward, even if it took a long time.
Obviously this is an extreme example where literally the only people mining are hobbyists in their homes (ie back to square one). But the market that BTC has already built will likely prevent that: as hash-power supply drops, its value will increase, therefore attracting more diverse miner pools.
All in all, I can only see how this will turn out with BCH crashing and BTC either slightly dropping before slowly starting to recoup, or dramatically increasing in value post-BCH-crash.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:49:46
At least try. You can literally just scroll down and find someone criticizing the way BCH is doing their little fork. You can also look at my recent post history to see what I've to say about it. At the very least, you should acknowledge that BCH is:
1. Currently mined mostly by Bitmain and associates
2. A fork with no technical improvements, and no, bigger blocks are not an improvement as SgWit already does that while also pushing updates to make the network more efficient
3. Defended mostly with vacuous (and fallacious!) arguments about Core being evil/corrupt

That is not how that works. The key phrase here is "abandoning your search". The fact that your node performed the search in the first place means some CPU power was expended on it, even if only for a ms. In that sense, there is a loss there.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:26:27
That's the opposite of what he said. SegWit is also a fork. That's what he means with "the agreement was to start mining something similar to Bitcoin". Essentially, the agreement was to fork Bitcoin to implement SegWit with the explicit purpose of avoiding multiple block chains. These parties which all were part of the agreement have now been instrumental in creating a second block chain, and are now threatening to split again with SegWit2x unless they get their way. If you don't see how that is going back on their word and acting in bad faith, we're just talking in circles.
@_date: 2017-08-15 03:35:28
Well, the market can be irrational, but most likely over the long term people will gravitate towards what is most efficient, what brings the most utility, or what is most comfortable. Bitcoin is currently the best solution in all three of those categories.

That's fine if you want to just sit on the sidelines and watch one of the two currencies crash and burn.

Specially for the sake of people who fall into category 3 and who have no choice but to read the digested arguments of others. That's the whole point of having a community after all.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:34:10
Look buddy, if you want to backtrack because you've changed your mine that's fine. But remember that you started this discussion by claiming that there was no difference between BTC with SegWit and BCH. If you want to argue in good faith you gotta be willing to concede when you're proven wrong.

It's only profitable for miners before the speculative bubble bursts. BCH has little utility and is an inferior clone on its best day. On its worst day, it's a malicious attack on the BTC blockchain.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:39:51
Only if everyone is already sufficiently informed. But as Bitcoin grows, new customers come in who know very little, and we need to constantly keep everyone on the loop.
@_date: 2017-08-22 22:03:35
It doesn't matter that everyone has the same chance of finding the block, more people means someone else is more likely to get it.
If you're the only miner in the network, your chances are always 100% of finding the next block. If there's another miner with the same hardware as you, you are both essentially racing to find it first. And because you're both pulling the same proverbial lever, each has equal chances of getting it. But that means you'll only get payed for half the blocks you'd otherwise have. The same would be true if there's a third miner, and so on. More people, less chances that any single miner gets payed.
It's not about the probability of finding a block changing. No one is saying that. It's about the chances of any one miner getting paid for it.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:52:05
There's something called a test network.
@_date: 2017-08-21 20:44:54
I don't think anyone is against bigger blocks (at least going by that Coinbase poll someone else shared), it seems most users support bigger blocks. But not like this.
How do you reckon bigger blocks will allow Bitcoin to scale? You acknowledged the risks of miner centralization couple, and so far there's been no discussion of how BCH will avoid that. SegWit can at least avoid node centralization by alleviating the block chain size problem over the long term. SegWit also has bigger blocks.
Also, how are LNs likely to create a monopoly, exactly? This is literally the first time I've heard of this and sounds completely implausible.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:04:33
What you said literally makes no sense. The emergency adjustment is the cause, not the solution, for this phenomenon. If anything, BTC is likely to survive this for that very reason you described.

@_date: 2017-08-04 22:34:01
That is a very elegant and succinct way to put it. Consensus is the only real way to accurately define something scientifically, and the same is true for the Bitcoin block chain.
@_date: 2017-08-02 21:34:24
That's a very flawed analogy. The devs don't run/approve transactions, nor do they mint coins. Those are the miners. And large pools of them already control a huge chunk of the computation power, and they stand to gain even more money from having bigger blocks, while at the same time pushing any competition out of the market. That's what BCH is really all about, and what SegWit is trying to prevent.
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:01:56
The nicest way I can put it is this: miners see a short term profit to BCH, and they're trying to obfuscate the discussion around the blockchain for their advantage.
The reason I claim this is because there is no technical advantage or inherent value proposition to BCH over BTC. That's why it's a bubble as opposed to a legitimate competitor. But there are those with vested interest to make it seem like there is more to it.
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:51:58

You have not shown that at all. You have stated that there's an incentive to maximize the amount of transactions that go through the LN, and that the number of channels any given node can connect to is limited by their wealth. It does **not** follow that connecting to only one single node would be the most viable economic strategy. On the contrary, opening several channels is simply more rational to avoid being disconnected from the network (in case of failures or timeouts with any given channel). There's no reason even the smallest nodes can't have at least a couple channels, however limited by funds they may be. The beauty of the LN is that it doesn't have to rely on each individual user opening a large number of channels for themselves.


I don't know how you come to this conclusion. The amount of hops is irrelevant to the end user or the LN nodes. Your ISP doesn't charge you extra for the amount of router hops your traffic has to go through.


This is irrelevant to LN. For expensive transactions, on-chain is better. This is working as intended.
EDIT: To clarify my first point, the LN doesn't require opening a large amount of connections for a single node any more than a router on the Internet is required to be connected to a large number of other routers on the Internet for me to be able to browse Reddit. The number of hops doesn't matter as long as there's a path between the sender and the recipient.
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:06:08
I wished your comment was required reading before posting. Too many people getting riled up over petty "ideologies" about What Bitcoin Really Is, or What Bitcoin Should Stand For, and whether or not something is in line with Satoshi's Original Vision.
In the end, the main reason why Bitcoin is valuable is because it is useful. Ideas are important, for sure, but they need to be manifested into something that is useful or desirable to be worth anything.
IMO this is why most alt-coins will never be worth their salt. Because they rely on selling an ideology as opposed to any actual utility. Take BCH, if it was ever to be successful, they ought to have implemented a feature that wasn't already in BTC (or about to be implemented), or introduce *something* that it was better at than BTC (like Ethereum did with Proof of Stake).
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:26:28
It's probably a mix of both. The days leading up to the fork and the SegWit activation dates saw slowing growth or even shrinking of the price. The subsequent stabilization coupled with invigorated confidence in the coin is likely what is driving the current wave of growth.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:02:46
To add to this, where do you get this idea that BTC is being mined at a loss? Just because a bunch of large Chinese pools flip to BCH doesn't mean BTC stops being profitable. It only works one way because BCH is merely speculative right now.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:41:36
What are you even talking about?
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:48:29
No, it's just that no one cares what an uninformed person has to say. If you can present a sound reason to support either BCH or 2x, be my guest (and I mean besides the usual "I support all, let the market decide!" rhetoric).
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:16:02
Yeah, so please explain to me how that increases centralization? Or for that matter, how increasing the block size is even remotely a competitive alternative? Because to me, it seems like that is just a workaround that won't help in the long term, while also having the side effect of dramatically reducing competitiveness of smaller miners.
@_date: 2017-08-22 20:31:33
The analogy doesn't work because not everyone flips only one coin at the same rate. Better hardware and bigger mining pools produce hashes in less time. So given the same starting time, the better pools have a better chance of finding the right hash.
Also, coin flipping is a bad analogy because the high probability of a success is misleading. A slot machine would be more accurate. If someone is playing on 1000 slot machines, and you're only playing in 1, they have a much higher chance of getting a payout faster. It's not about each successive event having a higher probability (gambler's fallacy); it's about multiple simultaneous events yielding a higher probability of success (the probability is cumulative).
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:38:16
Because Bitcoin and the crypto markets currently go hand in hand. It's in Bitcoin and the community's best interest to avoid crashes and glorified Ponzi schemes like these alt coins, so that retailers and investors will continue to trust the digital currencies as a whole.

Can we stop with the whole "let's avoid calling out BCH"? This question obviously pertains strongly to it, specifically, and we're already seeing hints of the effects predicted.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:46:53
I feel like we're totally agreeing here, I just want to clarify that I don't think bias is being used correctly here. A bias is an unwarranted preference for which there is no reasonable justification, usually based on intuition or prejudices.
So I would just like to say that while my posts are very much emotionally charged and kind of aggressive in tone, I don't think there's any bias when all the evidence overwhelmingly points to a single conclusion: BCH is a scam.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:51:57
I will give you this, none of us can predict the future. But don't tell me you can't see the pattern here: a particular subset of miners with lots of hash power are unhappy with the block sizes. They begin writing pseudo-philosophical pieces asking What Would Satoshi Do? to push for bigger block sizes. When that fails, they make a half assed fork that lets them dump a worthless coin for a quick buck. At the end of the day, when you compare apples to apples, BCH is no better than any of its predecessors.
ETH and LTC do have a different value proposition. They are also technically different, though the differences are nuanced and hard to understand. But I know they are different because there is something for me to understand that these coins do that Bitcoin doesn't. BCH does nothing that BTC doesn't already do, and better at that, once Segwit goes live.
BCH is literally just BTC except the people that push for it swear that it's totally better and literally What Satoshi Would Have Wanted. We've seen it time and time again before, so excuse me if I strongly believe this will have the exact same result.
@_date: 2017-08-21 18:22:16
You're missing the key point that without a trusted Dev team that remains impartial to the whims of miners (ie Core, since BCH is essentially the opposite of this) Bitcoin might as well rollover and die. And the propaganda needs to be fought fiercely at every turn.
I believe the evidence points strongly at Chinese influence trying to sow discord and distrust for the Core team. But even if it weren't (and finding proof would be very difficult if it was true), there's no denying the smear campaign that's been going on for years now.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:48:14
So? Again, explain how that's analogous to a central world bank regulating, approving and minting every single coin and transaction. Miners already control a significant portion of minting and approving, and due to government subsidies on electricity, it's likely that a certain region of the world will continue to amass more and more hashing power over the years. As time goes on and the blockchain gets larger, only the biggest mining pools will be able to make a profit. Bigger blockchains will only accelerate this process, further driving the competition for miners away from the market.
Again, someone needs to regulate all of this in order ensure the market stays competitive and decentralized. So are you gonna trust the engineers that have a vested interest in keeping Bitcoin prosperous in the long term, or are you gonna believe the miners who claim that the devs are evil without any concrete proof or arguments, while also standing more to gain in the short term from seeding distrust in the devs?
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:40:53
No. And honestly, that attitude is not gonna help Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:34:40
My bad, I meant to say reasonable people wouldn't care what you have to say.

@_date: 2017-08-04 16:23:49
Maybe, but it's also inaccurate. There's no reasonable way Segwit could make Bitcoin any more centralized than bigger block chains. That's just a conspiracy theory to push bigger block chains, which would mainly benefit the miners.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:14:27
Unlikely. Already this is likely the case: as BCH is mined and controlled mostly by Chinese miners, it's unlikely to ever take off and build a market of its own, outside of East Asia. It's important to note that it has not grown organically: Korean exchanges trade BCH very likely at the behest of the Chinese government (obviously there's no proof for this other than historic relationships between China and its allies, China's economic policies and authoritarian control as well as centralized planning, ie a bunch of speculation based on historic trends).
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:21:35
Honestly, if you're not convinced by the latest fork event, coupled with the growing network of vendors/suppliers that already take BTC as currency, I don't know what else can convince you.
BTC is solid in theory. Years of community effort have put that to the test and proven that it's also solid in practice. It's an inflation free currency that is only staked on a vast and growing network, as opposed to any institution or miscellaneous commodity. Governments/fiats can be collapsed, banks can be social engineered, commodities are limited and expensive.
I'm not trying to say that Bitcoin has no weakness, or that it's unhackable, or that's it's a 100% safe investment. But as it stands, today, it has many advantages over any other form of currency. And barring a catastrophic event that affects the Internet and the BTC network on a massive scale, there's very little chance of it ever losing market share as more and more people realize that all of these things are true.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:24:36
First of all, I'm not the one claiming anything. I am just repeating to you what the devs' argument for Segwit is: increase the blockchain size slightly while also ameliorating the cost of running a full node. It's essentially a glorified patch to maintain that mostly maintains the status quo while marginally increasing scalability.
BCH on the other hand, is just smoke and mirrors. So I ask you again, how is BCH even remotely a competitive alternative?
@_date: 2017-08-04 17:36:50
Yeah, and Dogecoin was worth a couple bucks for a while, too. That's called speculative value. But until you can actually trade BCash for goods, it has no real market value. That makes it really good if you want to make a quick buck while the bubble lasts, but unless it can attract genuine investment, it's no better than any of those other worthless coins that came before.
@_date: 2017-08-04 22:07:35
On the plus side, some countries have very low fees, and virtually no tax regulations on Bitcoin trade. There's still time to invest for retirement!

This again. Bitcoin is a tool. It's an engineering feat of technical skill to achieve a particular end. In this case, currency. If you want to go pray to Satoshi for deliverance that's your choice, but don't bring that nonsense into a serious discussion of what is best for Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-08-04 16:31:30
And he's totally right, too. What all of those "alt-coins" have in common is their lack of real market value due to the fact that they propose no unique technical advantages or trade-offs over Bitcoin. This makes them essentially useless since they offer no alternative or improved applications of the original tech. If they did, they'd each find their individual use and gain some adoption, much like LTC or ETH. But because they don't, and the people defending them typically resort to vacuous arguments and conspiracy theories, it's clear that these currencies are only a scheme to gain an edge in the crypto market.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:37:54
Sincere question: what do you think BCH offers that is technologically better than BTC/SegWit?
I believe there is genuine concern against 8MB size increase; specially when it is not coupled with any other scalability improvements. SegWit offers this with improved transaction storage and doubled block size cap. BCH on the other hand, at least so far, has offered nothing but empty rhetoric and a weak patch, while implementing all of this in a very non-centralized and shady manner.
@_date: 2017-08-14 22:31:48
To add to this, depending on what regulations your country has, you could stand to lose a significant portion of your payout in taxes.
In the US, for instance, BTC trades are taxed at capital gains rate of 15%. So if you bought 250 BTC at, say, 500 USD, and sell them at 4000 USD, your capital gains would be (4,000 - 500) * 250 = 875,000 USD. You'd have to report this and pay the IRS 15% of that, which would be 131,250 USD.
If you "cash out" by expending your BTCs directly, you avoid any taxes altogether on your investment, and only have to deal with sales tax.

It comes down mainly to a lack of technical understanding, which leads to a lot of petty arguments over moot ideological points.

That's not how trading works at all. You can always offer to buy at whatever price you want, and people can always offer to sell at whatever price they want. Of course, if you don't see others buying at around 19K you wouldn't think to do it either. Doesn't change the fact that people bought in of their own volition because they thought it was worth the price. Whether they were right or wrong, only time will tell.

Buddy, if you know anything about CS or economics, you should take like 10 minutes to read through any of those papers. Most of them aren't even worth the cost of byte storage. They're full of rambling, incoherent, clumsily put together arguments, which are usually either: A) predicated on false premises, or B) try to draw a relationship between two factors that are not actually related, without even attempting to analyze or present evidence that supports his opinions.
See for instance, his genius critique of SegWit as a "bait and switch" which "has 62.5% overhead" and "increases the amount of data storage and network traffic by 400%". This is then followed by what can only be described as the laziest attempt at discrediting the Lightning Network, by comparing side-chain transactions to fractional reserves. His logic is flawless, of course: because there's nothing stopping someone from building a fractional reserve on top of a side-chain, it must be the only possibility! Therefore side-chain bad because fractional reserve bad (no argument given as to why this would be the case, or what the merits and drawbacks of fractional reserves are). The possibility that side-chains allow for many more things than just making fractional reserve systems, and that building a fractional reserve banking system is already possible on Bitcoin alone (see Tether), never even crossed his mind. This is probably because he spent more time thinking up cute analogies to say "SegWit bad! Side-chain bad!" than actually thinking about how any of these things work.
For reference, [this is the paper I'm referring to](
@_date: 2017-08-04 18:18:52
Just because you don't trust the devs doesn't make their approach less sound. If you disagree that's fine, and if you can provide a compelling argument on why BCH provides a better solution, that'd be great.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:31:39
I strongly disagree. I think this coin is a petty scheme to earn quick cash for the miners, and investors as well as the general public need to be made aware of this. If this makes some people uncomfortable, so be it.
Not to mention too many people with too little understanding of the technical differences between the two giving bad advice.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:25:03
That is wrong. The way it works is effectively a race to the finish, where the first mining pool to find the PoW gets the reward. Therefore, yes, the chance of finding a block is proportional and inversely related to the competition in mining.
Difficulty adjustment also serves to accelerate this effect, by reducing profitability in proportion to mining speed. So, again, on both fronts, more mining power on one chain will dramatically reduce its profitability while increasing it for the alternate chain.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:20:42
A vision is not argument, anymore than the original whitepaper is an implementation. There is not a single way in which BCH is different from other Bitcoin forks. And there isn't a single technical advantage it has over BTC. If you want to plug your ears and keep repeating religious arguments over a technical debate, go right ahead. The market moves on.
@_date: 2017-08-17 00:00:42
Also, there are vulnerabilities to the blockchain protocol, such as the infamous 51% attack. The whole point of the blockchain is to grow ever more resilient to such an attack as the network grows, but it's something that the devs have to constantly watch out for and will (hopefully) continually address on an ongoing basis.

@_date: 2017-08-14 22:36:59
That makes no sense. Not saying the value cannot go down, but that this couldn't be a reason why it goes down. It could go down if a large number of traders pull out and stop accepting Bitcoin as payment. But the possibility of it increasing in value is both a deterrent to spend and an incentive to accept it as payment. Not a force for market share decrease.
@_date: 2017-08-04 23:31:23

I mean, in this far-fetched scenario in which chinese miners currently backing BCH were to drop BTC altogether, then competition would be naturally distributed among the rest of the world. That's all I was trying to imply. Miner centralization would still be an issue, and probably will require a redesign of PoW as you said.
@_date: 2017-08-05 21:23:32
Except that this is completely false when it comes to discussing the merits of BCH. Because it has none. If there was a single thing it proposed as an improvement, it would be different. Forking BTC just to add a half-assed patch to allow bigger block sizes is not a technical improvement.

Short answer, no. Long answer, he's written a lot of rambling pseudo-academic papers in which he fails to produce any evidence to speak of, make any meaningful connections between the concepts that he tries to talk about, or show even a basic understanding of the subject matter (be it Bitcoin technology or economics). Needless to say, none of these are peer-reviewed and they'd never get published by any self-respecting journal.
@_date: 2018-06-22 00:39:31
Calling it a tinfoil hat splinter is disingenuous. There's nothing about the Austrian school theories that suggests conspiracies. If anything, it's a lot closer to a true capitalistic theory of economics, which argues that *laissez-faire* markets are more efficient than centrally planned ones. It's ironic that the US is a big champion of Keynesian economics (which favors centralized monetary policies to manipulate the market), while also claiming to hold free markets and capitalism as core values.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:53:30
Sorry, it's hard to separate the bad faith actors from truly neutral ones. You're right, it was undue aggression and I apologize for that. You're also right that multiple chains don't necessarily have to be bad, and could be good, in theory, by offering competitive alternatives.
BCH is not one of those, however. It was launched with no road map for improvement, in a very closed manner that goes directly against the principles of an open source project like bitcoin. Proof of this is that even today I can't find a single reliable source of information on what the team is planning to do with it or how they will improve it over BTC. No roadmap, no planned features.
That by itself is pretty bad. On top of that, they've acted in bad faith by rejecting consensus in favour of their own currency. I'm talking about ViaBTC and associated pools that are main proposers for BCH, 2X and other predecessors (Bitcoin Classic, XT, the works). The reason there's so much animosity towards BCH, 2X and other forks backed by Bitmain, ViaBTC and the like, is because rather than propose clear and transparent ideas to improve BTC, they'd rather pump their altcoin with no real long-term plan. This is bad for all cryptos because when these coins crash it generated bad faith for the industry as a whole.
On top of that, you've got the whole Blockstream conspiracy theory constantly being thrown around by BCH backers to sow distrust for the Bitcoin Core team. Which, when you consider how SegWit is a genuine proposal for long term scalability proposed by the devs, and the alternative being pushed here is a vague promise that BCH will solve all of Bitcoins problems, it's clear as day to me that BCH and their supporters have to be either terribly misinformed, or acting in bad faith to wrestle control of the block chain.
Why wrestle control of the block chain? Because BCH by itself, like I've stated over and over, doesn't actually propose better tech. Therefore it can't build a market by itself without siphoning off of BTCs existing market. Investors and traders won't rationally go for a technically inferior alternative, so the only way to attract them is by manipulating the price and the mining difficulty to make it *seem* like BCH could be more profitably. This makes BCH unsustainable because whoever the devs are, they are clearly not interested in attracting a market with better features or, as their website states, 
a "sound currency", but seems more like they're catering to miners and short term speculative players.
@_date: 2017-08-21 19:29:51
Doubling the number of people rolling does not double the frequency of wins. It will increase the speed at which new wins, ie blocks, are found and payed out, but the difficulty adjustment means that flipping gets harder and harder, making it more expensive to participate. At the same time, double the amount of people reduces the individual chances of getting a win, also reducing profitability.

I'm all for a banking system that doesn't rely on manipulating the currency for the benefit of the owners (i.e. the fed and the central banks). If we could have a banking system that only focused on its intended job, i.e. being an intermediary that handles financial contracts, that'd be great. Other positive side-effects of a global, decentralized, open currency include transparent money, meaning every transaction is traceable so figuring out where the shell companies' money is coming from can be done automatically by anyone.

The only way it can really be trust-less is if you keep the physical gold in your home and only trade it in person. And much like its liquidity and divisibility, that only works well at certain scales (i.e. too much of it and it becomes difficult to transfer, store or divide without relying on a bunch of third parties). Bitcoin is much more flexible in all of these aspects without sacrificing any of its decentralized, trust-less properties.

That analogy is right on point. Most reactions from Americans when talking about fiat always comes down to either: "Why would I want crypto when the dollar is backed by the US government?" or "The dollar is better because when everything goes wrong the bank will protect me."

Why even have PoS if you're going to piggy back on a PoW blockchain anyway? Might as well just use a second layer solution like the LN. The PoS is intended as a replacement of PoW, and is otherwise useless if it can't be that. And it can't ever become that because it can't overcome the basic problem that removing PoW means you have no way to prove the costliness of forging transactions. As long as you rely on arbitrary things like "stake" or other purely-randomness-based mechanisms, you can never secure the network from attacks.
The problem is, proponents of PoS often overlook these things because [they're more concerned with other aspects]( of cryptocurrencies besides security and decentralization. They prefer to focus on (arguably) unimportant things like "energy consumption" or "transaction throughput", when Bitcoin's single most important feature is its decentralization, self-regulation, and reliability.
@_date: 2017-08-04 21:28:51
Just because you disagree with what is currently the best proposal to address the block chain size problem, doesn't mean that all of us who support it have some hidden agenda. Like I've told you already numerous times, Segwit provides some marginal improvement, whereas BCH and similar proposals don't. Meanwhile, I trust the devs to keep working on more improvements over the longterm, and I'm confident that they will. Marginal improvements like Segwit is the only way that Bitcoin will scale.

The real, best way you can support Bitcoin is educating yourself and others. But that is hard work and you just want to feel like you're contributing something by consuming things without actually putting any work or effort into anything.
@_date: 2018-06-11 22:38:54
There's definitely a good chunk of people who are only (or mostly) in it for the price speculation. You can see it on any given thread where every other comment chimes in with what the price in USD for BTC is at the moment, has been, or might be in the future.
That's too bad for them because that mindset will end up burning them out as the price will remain volatile for the foreseeable future. The rest of us know that Bitcoin is simply a superior technology and has the potential to become the best system for currency/payments on a global scale, bar none. I don't know if we're in the minority or not, but there's definitely a lot of us out there.

How is that bad product management? The mission critical features of Bitcoin are security and reliability. User friendliness is P2 at best, and that's by design. Which is why I said it might take a few years (or more!) before things like the LN are ready for mainstream use.
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:26:22
To be clear, I think Bitcoin is better than fiat in every way. I was just replying to the other guy’s snippy comment comparing the fact that most people don’t know how Visa works, to the fact that most people who are aware of Bitcoin don’t take it seriously or know how to use it. Totally different things, and at least Bitcoin has lots of potential to grow and improve, whereas something like Visa or PayPal is pretty much as good as it’s going to get.
@_date: 2018-06-29 17:51:10
The problem is this is often presented as if it's a unique property of Bitcoin, when in reality all goods, services and assets are the same. Nothing has value except for what people ascribe to it, hence supply and demand. Acting like this is unique to Bitcoin and a logical explanation for its price volatility shows a profound ignorance of basic economic concepts.
@_date: 2018-06-12 02:27:43
Inner workings != basic understanding. I don’t know shit about Visa but I know how to use it and I have a fairly accurate picture of how it works. Bitcoin is totally different and most people still think of it like some kind of silly internet money made up by someone.

First off, I agree with you like 90%. But like most Americans, I feel strongly that the US owes a lot of its success to its huge military force. Given that much of the tax money goes to funding the US Military, how would you justify a tax cut if it meant significantly downscaling the number of US troops, military bases, equipment and operations around the globe?

I don't think stating asking people to consider the motivations of this person's statement is the same as calling them a shill. There's no question he has a vested interest in pumping Bitcoin. If this is the kind of crap that people need to cling on to to feel that Bitcoin is worth their time then they are doing it wrong.

You could and people might go along with it, except peas are perishable, hard to divide and near impossible to transport long distance without defeating the point. Funny thing is, this is kind of how fiat works: the government says "you will accept this money because we're good for it" and then it's true. Bitcoin is simply an alternative that doesn't rely on vague promises. You should try to listen more and understand that a lot of what you've heard about money are misconceptions.

It will lose node support fast as blockchain size increases along with the minimum bandwidth and processing requirements to run a full mode. As demand for transactions increases, so do these requirements, which will cause the network to slowly drop nodes as they become unable to fully sync, which will cause the whole thing to come crashing down when a few handful of nodes aren’t enough to sustain the network.

What? If you have all the currency you still need to exchange it for something, unless you also control all the goods and services, in which case there's a bigger problem...
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:30:17
That's not how imports work.
There's no way in hell accepting Bitcoin can earn a margin of 70% for a merchant. "Middle-men" (as you put it) is code for businesses and individual merchants who absorb import costs, which include shipping and taxes and can easily rack up to a 20% or 30% of mark up on the original unit price.
Using Bitcoin doesn't mean you get to save on **any** import cost. You still have to pay taxes or risk having your business shut down, and you still need to transport the goods. If you think there's some mysterious additional 40% that comes from "middle-men" artificially inflating prices to make bank, then you have no clue how the market works.

Sweet summer child. You give us too much credit.
But seriously, I think glitch (or bug) can be defined as unintended side-effects causing unforeseen behavior which may or may not be detrimental to the user experience (or just be weird). In this case, the single point of failure is an unintended side effect of having trust-based, centralized payment verifications. Good thing some really smart engineers came up with a better solution and Visa is in the process of being deprecated!
@_date: 2018-06-01 18:36:14
I agree with you, but one thing I've learned writing regression tests is to never say never. It might be a weird corner case or some faulty edge case might be discovered in the old code that needs to be fully deprecated. So "100% absolutely never hard fork" is not a principle I'd want the development to go by. On the other hand, "hard forks should only be an absolute last resort after every other option has been exhausted" is a better principle IMO.

You didn’t answer anything, just restated my question. PoS is not remotely the same thing as the LN or even side chains. It’s meant to replace PoW, and it will fail because it doesn’t do what it’s supposed to: provide a consensus mechanism that doesn’t rely on trust and is able to recover from a variety of potential problems like network partition, chain splits and 51% attacks (or the equivalent).  Trying to group it into the same category as actual solutions is disingenuous. Downvoted.

Did you even read the article? The problem runs much deeper than disk space for storing the state history of ETH. It’s about network bandwidth and throughput which grows at a much slower pace than hardware and which is the main bottleneck for ETH. Sharding does nothing to solve this fundamental problem, that’s why it’s a pipe dream. As demand for ETH grows it will have fewer and fewer full nodes leading to a total collapse of the network.

That's a very long winded say of saying "well you can invest your money to get around inflation!". As if there was no use case for wanting to keep a stable amount of wealth in a more liquid, easily accessible medium. You can try to beat the market but all investment comes at a risk. Bitcoin, like gold, is a minimum risk commodity.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:31:34
Access to gold can be lost forever if you leave it lying around or if someone steals it. Bitcoin is virtually impossible to steal, and some basic precautions like backing up your wallet and private key will prevent you from losing access to your private address. You wouldn't store gold bars under your mattress, so it makes sense to take some basic measures to protect your BTC.
And like someone else mentioned, the devs don't regulate Bitcoin. They implement features but it's up to the community (nodes and miners) to adopt it. See the S2X debacle for how little sway the devs actually have.

This is the part that breaks my heart, as a fellow recent CS grad. So many smart people that seem blind to all this 'blockchain' nonsense and genuinely *feel* like this or that shitcoin proposal is going to change the world. In reality, most of these are nothing more than some very impressive looking websites which promise to be everything Bitcoin does *but better* without any clear understanding of how the network actually works, what its shortcomings are, or where the areas of opportunity lie.
And it kills me because there are, for the most part, really passionate and brilliant people who just can't seem to help missing the forest for the trees. It's a long road ahead before the public record will be set straight and Bitcoin will be recognized for what it is: a groundbreaking invention at the cutting edge of innovation for currencies and global payments.

Well it's still a risk, much like accepting Bitcoin at all, but even bigger: the reason this is a viable strategy is betting on the value of Bitcoin to increase as more people adopt it.

That doesn't seem like a very strong argument when most people still can't grasp the basics of how Bitcoin works. Sure, at this point most people are aware of Bitcoin and have some idea of what it is (accurate or not). But that's about it. While almost everyone I know has heard of Bitcoin, only one or two actually have an idea of how it works, and only one of those two actually understands it. Same here: even in a subreddit dedicated to Bitcoin, many comments appear uninformed as to the most basic and essential parts of what makes it unique.

@_date: 2018-06-22 22:36:29


Yep, therefore, the dollar has value as long as the US gov. is around to say it does, and as long as other countries want to trade with the US. That's it. There are no protections afforded to you by the US government. The Federal Reserve isn't going to give you back your house if inflation causes you to become insolvent and can't pay your mortgage. Your mistake comes from thinking that the dollar is designed to help you, when in reality it was designed to help the government.
@_date: 2018-06-22 22:01:54
I don't think you understand how money works at all. Saying it's "backed by the US" in reality means that the dollar has value because the US government says so, not more, not less. Banks secure your money in dollars because it's the most widely accepted currency, not because it's the safest currency to use. You're confusing two separate characteristics of money: issuance and security from theft. That latter is a service provided to you by banks, which can just as easily apply to any form of currency.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:10:38

I agree, but that's only half the story. The ability to make payments within a completely trust-less system is what makes Bitcoin what it is, and also the reason it's valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:32:56
This is a very simplistic view, based on a number of premises that are true today but will not necessarily remain true in the future. BTC is a "deflationary currency" only in the sense that today it keeps growing in demand as awareness spreads rapidly. And the only reason people are paid in fiat money is because, as far as the layman knows today, that is the best kind of payment. If the Bitcoin project succeeds, then these two factors will change.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:39:35

Miner support is meaningless. Miners will mine whatever makes them more money. Which is why there's still Bitcoin transactions being signed without a hitch.

@_date: 2017-11-07 03:13:47
Just to add to your comment, S2X is absolutely not an upgrade in any meaningful way. Increasing the block limit does not in any way improve the network.

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:38:41
If you think any alt even comes close to competing with Bitcoin, you have a very poor understanding of why it went from 1 to 8K USD. Wide-spread awareness and adoption is what makes Bitcoin *the* trust-less payment system, and why all the other are the alts. So far, even nation wide sanctions have not put a dent in that, so it's a pretty tall order that some alt would take its place.
That's not even mentioning the fact that alts have nothing to do with Bitcoins' own market. You're basically just moving the goal posts at this point. Bitcoin is valuable independent of how many forks and alts there are.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:37:29
Why would you spend that kind of money on *drinks*, regardless of what your portfolio looks like? If I had 10% of my wealth in cash, and 90% on investment funds, which one would I use to pay for a night of drinks? Appreciating in value is not a characteristic that is exclusive to Bitcoin. But there's always someone meme-ing about how Bitcoin will fail if people don't use it to pay for their lattes or whatever.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:52:54
That was actually a really flawed and inaccurate explanation. If no one is selling Bitcoin while the demand stays the same, the price will increase dramatically. For the demand to drop, people have to stop wanting Bitcoins. The only way that happens is if you can no longer use them for anything, which is a completely different scenario than if everyone is holding.
The only scenario in which Bitcoin's demand decreases is if it's no longer useful: i.e. if the network becomes centralized such that the system is no longer trust-less.
Consider this: China recently announced what is essentially a ban on Bitcoin exchanges. Did this mean that suddenly Bitcoin's price dropped because Chinese people could no longer buy or sell them? During the first few days, yes, as the market panicked and everyone scrambled to sell. But within two weeks, after panic subsided, demand massively increased because of increased awareness around the globe coupled with supply now being limited in China.
Bitcoin isn't useful because you may one day be able to use it to buy everything on a daily basis. You can already do that with Visa or PayPal. Bitcoin is useful because it can't be stopped, regulated or controlled by any single entity. That's what it means to be trust-less and censorship resistant. This is the only thing that makes Bitcoin useful, and as long as this remains true, it will still be valuable.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:55:00
What on earth does that have to do with anything? The average price is the best measure of what people are willing to pay for Bitcoin. If you sold 20% of the global supply of **any** commodity in the world the price would also crash. Not only is this a far fetched idea, it's a completely empty argument.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:41:32
The whole argument spawns from pure speculation. The idea that “Bitcoin won’t be valuable if people don’t trade” **is** pure speculation. It also happens to be wrong and based on a number of flawed assumptions.

@_date: 2017-11-20 01:01:34
That's because you really don't understand economics. It really is as simple as that. Nothing has inherent value, but what the market assigns to it. Demand from Bitcoin stems primarily from being a trust-less, electronic system that can be accessed anywhere with an Internet connection. Everything else (like block size, transaction volume, depreciating) are just talking points with no substance.

You can also store gold. Good luck transferring those commodity assets across the globe, though.
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:42:15
Even if this happens, it doesn't matter. This whole thread is an exercise in people missing the point about what Bitcoin is all about.
It's a trust-less and censorship resistant payment network. Just because people may not use it for buying groceries doesn't mean it's worthless. Just like how gold is one of the world's most valuable commodities despite its lack of liquidity (by modern standards), Bitcoin will be valuable as long as the network exists, because there'll never be a time where being able to make an electronic payment without a bank or government interfering stops being useful.

Big blocks don't solve anything. The forks are built on lies, like the big lie that bigger blocks will produce cheaper transactions. In reality, the only thing these forks accomplish is increasing miner centralization and making it easier for the big players to corner the market.

@_date: 2017-11-20 00:26:29
You're starting from the flawed premise that Bitcoin is a deflationary currency. The reason the price keeps inflating is because demand is growing due to increased awareness and merchants who will accept it as payment.
In a long-term scenario where Bitcoin "reaches maturity", i.e. is widely adopted to the point where demand can no longer grow significantly, then its appreciating effect will be minimal so as to not be noticeable at all.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:48:00
You’re making a lot of assumptions with zero actual analysis. The problem is about more than storage and processing speed; network bandwidth is the biggest bottleneck. Most of the world can’t even afford a decent 20mbps internet connection, and you think 8mb blocks are no big deal?

You keep using words like narrative, drivel and hype, but I don’t think you understand the meaning of what you’re saying. It is not hype to state the fact that, historically, citizens of corrupt and failing regimes tend to abandon the local currency in favor of other stores of value as a result of hyperinflation. A very recent example is Venezuela. It’s also not drivel to state that, in these cases, Bitcoin would be an ideal alternative to other stores of value such as the US dollar.

Yes, they do. The whole system works because miners are economically incentivized to ensure transactions are valid.

The “no central authority” is the key there. That’s what makes Bitcoin unique. And there’s more to it than just the block chain. The block chain itself is just a chained ledger of transactions. It’s the whole protocol, which includes mining and economic reward through a token, that makes it work.
People talk about “the Blockchain” as though there’s anything particularly interesting about it that is separate from Bitcoin. This is simply false. Take away the rest of the protocol and the block chain part is completely useless. Hence the analogy to an inefficient distributed database.

For one thing, the silly idea that is somehow still popular to this day that some national currencies are still backed by a gold reserve. This hasn't been the case for well over half a century.
Likewise the popular misconception amongst the crypto community that hodling is detrimental towards adoption of Bitcoin as currency is straight up wrong and the opposite of how commodity-based currency markets have historically developed.
In general, understanding the history of currency is crucial to understanding the importance of Bitcoin.

Repeat after me: miners mine the most profitable chain. The most profitable chain is the one that is most highly valued by the market. Hence, the value is never correlated to mining power, but to user adoption.

Alright, I'm going to break it down for you point by point because you clearly have huge misunderstandings about what Bitcoin is and isn't, and what the blockchain does and doesn't do.


Wrong. The blockchain is not safe, immutable or powerful on its own. On its own, it's an inefficient distributed database. It's the combination with two other systems that gives it those desirable qualities mentioned: security, immutability, power. The two system I'm referring to are the token-based rewards coupled with the hash-based mining system.
Without both a hash-based mining system to create deterministic consensus, and a token reward (i.e. the "coin" part of Bitcoin) to punish malicious actors, the whole thing falls apart. The blockchain on its own is not revolutionary or innovative in any way. It's a data construct which has been known in computer science since pointers were invented. However, it's a part of a larger system, Bitcoin, that is revolutionary and innovative.


Wrong again. There's only a few, very limited applications for which a token-based trust-less transaction system is useful. Digital, global payments is one. I've yet to see a serious, non-bullshit proposal for a different kind of application that applies the basic concepts behind Bitcoin in a way that 1) doesn't compromise the fundamental mechanisms in a way that breaks the trust-less, decentralized nature of it; or 2) a bunch of nonsense pipe dream promises with no science or research to back it up (looking at you, ETH).
@_date: 2019-01-14 22:07:45
What kind of nonsense logic is that? Bitcoin's adoption is not directly correlated to the economic activity in a country.
Yeah, you can't use it in Starbucks today because of low liquidity and market volatility shaking faith in the currency, hence businesses being reluctant to accept it as payment. This is not new and will likely be a problem for years as the market slowly grows, until there's enough adoption that the price becomes relatively stable. None of this is correlated to the GDP in any way.
If anything, it's possible an inflationary crisis might actually boost adoption of Bitcoin. See Venezuela.

The story as is usually presented simply didn't happen. People didn't go crazy buying flowers at the price of a house until they all went poor.

Incorrect. All of that can already be done with existing RDBMS. The innovative part about Bitcoin is being a trust-less payment system, with the positive side effect of being highly censorship resistant. Blockchain is one part of the protocol that allows this, not more not less.

It’s a reference to a famous scene depicted in the Bible and in murals of Christian tradition. Jesus expelled the merchants who were disrespecting a place of worship by shamelessly shilling out crap right there at the temple. He literally used a whip to drive them out, knocking over their tables and kicking their shit around (or so they say in the scriptures anyway).
Here, the meme draws a parallel with Bitcoin (and it’s creator) serving as a philosophical catalyst for a change in how the banking system is perceived. Instead of the old neoliberal school of thought praising banking as the arch-guardians of “the economy”, the existence of Bitcoin disproves the false claim of authority over money that centralized banking institutions would like us to continue believing they have.

There is no logical argument. There's lies: the lie that bigger blocks will reduce transaction costs dramatically and without it Bitcoin will never be scalable; the lie that there's some conspiracy from te Core devs to keep Bitcoin down; the lie that LN will lead to more centralization instead of less; the lie that S2X is a benign "improvement" that Core refuses to agree to; the lie that there was an agreement to implement it, as opposed to a backroom deal between corporate suits; the lie that S2X and BCH is all about fair competition, as opposed to an attempt to wrestle control from Bitcoin for private and state interests. And on it goes.

And you could also argue that contentious forks are the true Bitcoin. You'd be dead wrong in both instances.
@_date: 2017-09-19 18:41:09
IMO you have yet to give a concrete example of technology directly increasing wealth inequality. On the contrary, I think every example you've given is an example of how there's less inequality thanks to technology. Refrigeration has allowed every household to own a refrigeration, effectively owning the means of production for ice, and lowering the cost of frozen and perishable goods for everyone. The fact that some people lost their jobs picking ice is not proof of more inequality. It just doesn't work that way from a macro-economic perspective.
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:44:47
You don't see many of them because there is no reasonable argument for S2X. There's misinformation and blatant lies, and that's about it. Then, when called out on it, they resort to accusing the Core devs of vague conspiracies to destroy Bitcoin.

@_date: 2017-10-02 20:57:42


That's fundamentally contradictory to what Bitcoin is about. You claim that "the government" will be able to easily destroy Bitcoin by rolling out their own version and banning Bitcoin. Look at what China just did, and see how well that worked out for them. People in China are still trading BTC, because the whole point of it is that no single entity can overpower it.
Another thing, there's such a thing as supply and demand. If you believe that the price is 100% speculation you haven't been paying attention. Granted, there is certainly a lot of speculation and uncertainty about the future, which is why the price fluctuates so much. But it's silly to assume that it's overvalued.
I encourage you to read more about it, because it sounds like you have several strong and incorrect assumptions about how Bitcoin works.
@_date: 2017-09-29 22:09:14
This really cannot be overstated. If these people were smart enough to code Bitcoin, they'd contribute directly to Core. But they're not and they can't, and so S2X doesn't stand a chance.
Any companies supporting it will end up shooting themselves in the foot.

Except Core is not doing that, so you are the only one spreading propaganda here. Bigger blocks are not an improvement for end users, and have serious implications in terms of scaling and miner centralization. This is a real problem, relatively high fees over the next few years is not.

That has nothing to do with what I'm saying. Of course there's speculation, the same goes for Bitcoin. One more time, what I'm saying is that at least something like Ethereum has the possibility of increasing in value because of its utility. The same cannot be said of forks like Bitcoin Cash.
Hence, ETH might be a risky investment, but at least it has a chance. Buying BCH is literally just throwing away money.

Before you get swayed by this person's rant, be aware that increasing the block size carries a very real risk of increasing miner centralization. This is a very big issue, whereas "high fees" are really more of a misrepresentation put forth to spread the (completely false) idea that there are two valid arguments to this discussion. The reality is that miners stand to lose a lot from SegWit, and to gain from bigger blocks. S2X is a tool for them to fight for this and convince misinformed people like this person to fight for their cause, even though it is completely against the users' best interests.

If there really was some crazy conspiracy it'd be obvious and easy to point out in the code.
And yeah, hardware is cheap in the US. Sadly Bitcoin is supposed to run over the whole world.

Different poster, but I think I can give you an answer. The problem is not the hard limit increase by itself. I doubt many people have strong objections to raising the block size limit, and there was a survey a few weeks ago that confirms this. Going by that survey, what ticks people off (myself included) is the way the change is being pushed, by turning a technical issue into a political "holy war", with one side being notorious for spreading fear and distrust of the devs through misinformation. To be perfectly clear, I am talking about r/btc and Bitcoin Cash supporters, or in general, supporters of these kinds of altcoins. I can go into more detail and give some more clear examples, but let me just leave you with this:
For months, the BCH camp were clamoring for bigger blocks which, in their view, were a necessity *right now* and every single day that the Core team refused to do it was due to malicious intent to keep Bitcoin down (for money or whatever tenuous conspiratorial motive they could come up with). Lo and behold, SegWit is out, and the big players who couldn't wait to get a bigger block size are lagging behind in adopting it, even though SegWit actually addresses the miner centralization **and** the transaction congestion problems, both at the same time, where bigger blocks don't do much to help with either, and actually make centralization potentially worse (which is the main reason Core refuses to take that risk). This shows that support for BCash (or S2X for that matter) does not come from genuine faith in the technology behind it, but rather from wanting to take control away from the Core devs, at best, or from outright malicious intent to push for more dependence on miner centralization, at worst.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:38:13
Just to be clear, it's not true that BTC wouldn't be worth anything if everyone held and never spent. That is simply not how supply/demand works. As long as BTC can be used to transfer wealth, it doesn't matter how many transactions there are. This is one of the myths perpetrated by big blockers to spread FUD. Even if there was only 1 transaction per day, as long as there's demand for Bitcoin it will remain valuable.

Ok, so, really, what is your problem? If you really believe node count doesn't matter, despite every forking incident being proof to the contrary, why do you keep repeating it over and over?
Also, you keep misquoting the whitepaper as saying node count doesn't matter. This is false; the whitepaper states that the majority of hashing power helps secure the network. At the time it was written, there was no distinction between nodes and miners. The point you're trying to make is misleading and wrong.
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:09:20
You're just wasting everyone's time with these walls of text. You can type out "CPU power is the only thing that matters!" in different ways as many times as you want, it's still false and directly contradicts history.

@_date: 2017-09-18 19:57:47
No, my friend. That is not how it works. The price changes partly over speculation of its value which is affected by news, or in this case, greatly exaggerated claims of impending doom. That doesn't mean that there's "disagreement" over its value. Markets don't work on "agreements", so I'm not even sure what you mean by that. Bitcoin's value is still mainly based on supply and demand like any commodity.

And yet you keep spreading BS, claiming that transactions are being crippled by the devs, when the opposite is true.

@_date: 2017-10-17 19:56:46
My point is that barring a large scale and successful attack on the network, loss of mining power will never hurt the demand (and therefore the price) of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-18 17:45:29
If by fees going ridiculous you mean maybe doubling the average price, sure. At least until the difficulty adjustment. This wouldn't cause anyone to jump ship to an altcoin. Again, this is the kind of fallacious logic that leads people to bet on things like Bitcoin Cash. Transaction volume does not affect demand for Bitcoin; it works the other way around, miners follow the price which follows demand.
And there's no conceivable scenario in which demand for Bitcoin drops, except for a large scale and successful attack on the network. Which is my point. Mining power is irrelevant, whatever the miners signal for is irrelevant. We've seen it time and time again.
@_date: 2017-10-16 01:47:24
You're silly. Block generation won't claw to a halt. And most of us holders are willing to stick it out for a few weeks, months even, if it comes to that, to make sure the legitimate chain survives. At some point, miners will switch back simply because the legitimate chain will always be more profitable than the shitcoin. We've seen it time and time again.
@_date: 2017-10-02 21:49:18

@_date: 2018-07-26 00:05:23


Nothing comes for free. You should be more distrustful of anything claiming to be free. The reality is, free transactions do come at a cost: reliability, stability and security. What all these altcoins are trying to hide behind layers of obfuscation with shit like the Tangle™ or Ethereum's Sharding© is the same basic problem which Bitcoin is trying to solve: how to get consensus without a centralized point of authority. These scams can put all the bells and whistles they want around it, but at the end of the day, to be decentralized you need a broadcasted-network model and PoW to tie the whole thing together.
The only way these shitcoins can achieve any of the things they want to do, they have to trade off the security or the decentralized nature of the network (see the above obfuscation layers of crap), which is the entire point of Bitcoin. That's why all of these crappy coins are bound for failure: they'll either crash as it becomes apparent they're just Bitcoin with a hell of a lot more overhead, or they'll give up any pretense they have left of being decentralized and trust-less at all, and therefore become entirely pointless.

Just because the box isn’t worth a Ferrari doesn’t mean it’s worthless. The fact that you “own” the box and want to keep it means you won’t part with it unless someone is willing to agree on something of equal value to trade for it, hence supply and demand. It can be a Ferrari, a piece of chocolate, or a blade of grass. But the point is, as long as there are people willing to hold onto BTC and not part with it unless given something of “equal” value (as determined by the market), there will be demand for BTC. Therefore holding creates demand, therefore you’re wrong (and probably lying about your studies since you don’t seem to grasp basic supply and demand concepts).

Being centralized defeats the whole purpose. If it's just a private blockchain with every node controlled by one entity, we already have a name for that. It's called a sharded database. Essentially just a database with many copies distributed to different computers. Adding a blockchain on top of that is completely unnecessary and would just make it terribly inefficient.
Thinking that Bitcoin is just one application of blockchain technology is missing the entire point of the blockchain, what its purpose is, and the way it functions. It's the equivalent of saying the Internet is just a single specific application of routing technology. It requires some serious misconceptions of those terms and what the utility of the technology is.
@_date: 2018-07-25 23:42:13


This is wrong for all the reasons stated in the article and in my other comment. Holding gives the market liquidity, and investors will simply follow the market.


No, and you clearly didn't read a single word of anything except the title of my post. Spending and replacing does nothing to incentivize anyone. If you're actually spending (i.e. trading) Bitcoin with some merchant, then they already by definition accept (i.e. hold) Bitcoin. The fact that there's other merchants accepting/holding Bitcoin is what incentivizes the rest, not who you choose to trade with or what you trade your Bitcoins for.

See this is exactly what I mean by jumping to conclusions. Let’s examine one of the premises of your argument:


This is a very strong assumption with no evidence to back it up. The mere fact that the Internet (a giant decentralized routing network) exists disproves this.
That aside, you’re making a flawed comparison between routing nodes and enterprise grade servers. They are not remotely the same, and the costs incurred are on different scales. A routing node simply forwards packets, whereas a server (in the enterprise definition) needs to deal with a wide range of business logic through RPCs or some other form of request, on top of misc. features like load balancing or dynamic resource allocation. Compare this to TOR routers or simple Internet routers which do very little and require minimal maintenance since they only need to concern themselves with running protocol software.
Not only are you jumping to conclusions about the cost of running a node, you’re making your analysis based on a false equivalency against a completely different kind of “node”.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:09:18
On a purely technical level, Bitcoin would not exist today, let alone be worth thousands of dollars, were it not for software upgrades like SegWit. The biggest lie in the article is claiming that there is such a thing as "Satoshi's vision". In reality, there's the functional and useful Bitcoin developed by Core. The rest are just shitty copies.
@_date: 2018-07-13 18:11:40
I agree with your point that server hosting costs will set a lower bound for how cheap transactions can be. Whether that's 1 Satoshi per hop (unlikely) or 10 or 10K is hard to say, since it will be set based on a number of factors like transaction demand, the price of Bitcoin and the number of nodes. But it seems like you keep trying to argue it won't be cheap simply because hosting incurs cost, which is a very naive analysis.
@_date: 2017-09-19 19:10:14
Are you salty that you sold the dip?
@_date: 2018-07-12 23:02:41


Demand for transactions should drive the price up. This in turn will attract investors willing to put up nodes in order to earn routing fees. This will increase the robustness of the network by having more nodes, while also driving the price down as competition between nodes increases.


What? The reason why Netflix can't replace their streaming services with torrents is because they're a private company which owns all of their serving infrastructure. Bitcoin and the LN are decentralized protocols enabling competition for serving micropayments over the Internet. This comparison is mind boggling. Might as well be asking why Apple doesn't switch to a peer-to-peer sales model.

Kudos for wanting to learn more rather than jump on the bandwagon.
Segwit2x (or S2X) is a fork in the Core Bitcoin code to double the block size limit. It was created as a result of the NYA agreement, in which a number of exchanges and mining pool CEOs got together, without a single developer, and decided to create the fork for the benefit of the miners (the block size limit increase).
If you currently own Bitcoin, you might want to investigate whether your wallet or exchange plans on implementing this contentious fork. You can [check this link]( to find out which of the companies that originally signed the agreement to implement the fork have withdrawn or stayed silent.
If you have a wallet or have your coins at an exchange that is part of the agreement, you can move your coins out to a safe wallet. You can also help by running a Core node.
Finally, you can help by correcting misinformation and blatant lies from S2X supporters. These are typically people who stand to gain from undermining Bitcoin and the Core developers, or are too ignorant and misguided to know better.

The point is killing the dictator doesn't change anything. Cut off one head, two more take its place. The resulting power vacuum usually breeds more war and strife, which invariably ends in yet another dictatorship to replace the chaos from overthrowing the previous one.
To be clear, I'm not against removing dictators from power. I just want you to be aware that it usually solves absolutely nothing, since historically it only serves to shift the power from one tyrant to another.

The only retarded thing is thinking you can "get" anyone to do anything. Trading Bitcoin with a merchant *that already accepts it* does nothing to incentivize others to do the same. The merchant has to accept it in the first place, which means they are already holding it, which is what *actually* incentivizes the rest of the market to join in.

That's a fundamentally wrong premise to base anything on. Of course browsing the Internet incurs cost. Even hosting a website in the 90's cost *something*: electricity to keep servers running, upkeep/maintenance costs for the communication infrastructure (AKA paying for the freaking Internet), time to set the website up and debug any issues.
The idea that something can be free until it gets monetized is ridiculously naive. Anything and everything has a cost.

Bitcoin is only as good as the integrity of the network. If the S2X crowd had their way, they'd create mayhem on the Core chain, causing people to lose confidence in it and stop using Bitcoin altogether. Whether Bitcoin succeeds or fails, S2X is bound for failure because it has no development power, no realistic goals, and no future. Core and most of the community would never get on board with a corporate backed, contentious fork, and in the case their project succeeds, will abandon Bitcoin entirely for a better alternative.
@_date: 2017-09-29 21:07:17
And that's very unfortunate for Coinbase users, if they do continue the farce that S2X is Bitcoin. The price may tank, but Bitcoin will survive.
@_date: 2017-10-21 19:30:56
Not at all. After no more Bitcoins can be mined, the supply of coins will be fixed and stable, therefore the price of any particular good or service would vary proportionally to its supply/demand.
For now, while Bitcoin supply can still increase, albeit slowly, this would in theory reduce the price continuously. However, its rise in value will continue as awareness spreads and demand for it grows, offsetting any depreciation from increased supply.

Whatever anyone is willing to bid for it. You kids need to stay in school, maybe take an introductory course in economics, before you go spouting nonsense.


You literally just proved yourself wrong with your goofy Ferrari example. If Ferrari doesn't want to sell the "box", it only becomes more expensive (or "valuable"), not less. These are your, words too:


Things have value because people want to buy them, simple as that. Bitcoin tokens have value as long as anyone wants to hold or trade for them. You know this because you literally gave an example of this in a very long winded, obfsucated way.


100% wrong, since just holding BTC is still enough to create demand, as we've established.
@_date: 2018-07-25 22:04:34
To summarize one of the article's main points: "The best form of money will be the one that most people have accepted", and since holders by definition accept Bitcoin, a currency with more holders is naturally more attractive. Since the market follows the trend of holders in a positive feedback loop, it will tend to converge on a single currency determined by the long term holders.
So not only is the idea that holding Bitcoin is bad for the ecosystem ultimately ridiculous, it's the exact opposite of the truth.
Side note, since the market will tend to converge on a single coin with the largest market cap, Bitcoin maximalism is the only rational position to have. This is also true from a technical perspective, not just an economic one, but that's a whole other topic.

The whole point of Bitcoin is replacing bureaucracy with software. While the premise of your point is valid, you're jumping to conclusions without making any actual cost analysis.

@_date: 2017-10-21 19:48:43
I think you push the ideological narrative a bit too hard. I prefer a more technical explanation of what Bitcoin should be: a decentralized and censorship-resistant system for electronic payments. It's not about killing the banks and governments of the world, as some people seem to believe. Bitcoin won't ever do that. But it will change the way we think about money and corporations. People won't be forced to rely on institutions, which can be corrupted and coerced, but instead will be able to rely on truly democratic systems.

We'll probably never know who Satoshi was, but Nick might as well be Satoshi, though. Or at least his word should carry as much weight as Satoshi's.
@_date: 2018-04-11 20:05:46
Because it’s a wrong opinion. The whole meme is that currencies get their value from being spent, when this is patently false. Study the history of currencies, and you find that they actually derive their value from several properties, including:
* collection value (non-duplication)
* ease of transfer
* storage of value (non-perishability plus security)
* awareness (how many people acknowledge it as a store of value)
The last point is what most people get fixated on, because of the way we’ve been trained (read: mislead) to think about money, based on the fiat model. But it is by no means a necessity for a currency to grow.

Satoshi is not a fucking messiah. If it even was a single person, they were just a computer scientist. He published a paper which itself was based on other computer scientists's work. Nick was one of them, and a crucial one at that. In any case, Satoshi is not giving out opinions, but you should take heed of the word of someone who is an actual expert. Szabo may not be Satoshi, but you should listen to him as though he were, because he might as well be.

DISCLAIMER: no one can really predict what the price will be like in 1 year, it might go down, it might stay the same, it might shoot to the moon, so take any predictions with a grain of salt.
Now, that said, I think what you're saying comes from the idea that Bitcoin in its current form has no real value, or has some very little value, with the price being based mostly or fully on speculation. This idea stems from the premise that Bitcoin will only truly attain "real" value by being adopted as a common place currency.
I think this way of looking at Bitcoin is totally backwards and 100% wrong. Bitcoin already is useful: it's the world's most secure store of value, it can be transferred at minimal cost in large volumes across the world, and you can carry any amount of wealth in a secure way within your pocket. That's what the price is mainly based on: Bitcoin's utility as a collectible and a store of value. The final stage of its evolution as a currency, when it is finally adopted as a legitimate currency by most of the world, is yet to come, and will surely bring about another huge price surge, but it is not a pre-requisite for Bitcoin to be "truly valuable".

Can you clarify what your position is on taxes? I'm guessing you're arguing in favor of taxes here, but your argument is so needlessly derisive and sarcastic that I can't really tell.
If you are in fact arguing for taxes, then we're in agreement, but the way you're going about is totally backwards. The previous poster is not arguing taxes are inherently evil, but that it's possible for taxes to be unfair, inefficient, or misused, hence why people may have legitimate reasons to resent them. You don't need to move to Afghanistan to understand this. And again, I say this as someone who supports higher taxes in exchange for better/more efficient public services: people can hate taxes and that's OK; skipping taxes is not OK, however.

Spending is not a requirement for adoption. Look up the article “The Bullish Case for Bitcoin” to understand how currencies have actually evolved throughout history.
Besides, there’s no reason to rush adoption. The infrastructure is still under development and we’re not ready for worldwide adoption just yet. In my experience, most people itching to get the word out and have massive adoption are doing so in hopes of the price increasing so they can sell sooner. If that’s your deal, that’s fine, but there’s no two-sided-ness to it: those of us who actually believe in the product will wait as long as it takes for it to grow organically.

All good points. Also, it’s noteworthy that the infrastructure is not there yet for a full planet-scale network operating on the third or fourth phases. We need to take things slow. The only people pushing for quicker adoption are the get-rich-quick-types who just want the price to increase so they can sell.

Except that’s a gross misrepresentation of what the LN actually is. By that definition of “third party” all cryptos rely on third parties.

Satoshi is not a person, it's a pseudonym for what may be a real person or group of people. In either case, they're not around anymore, so arguing about what Satoshi would want or "his vision" is pointless for a very simple reason: whoever Satoshi was, they made Bitcoin to be modifiable and open to new ideas. It's the devs jobs to sort out the good ones from the bad ones from a technical and ethical standpoint.

Do the NSA and whatever the hell the UK's equivalent agency is called have projects to survey communications and de-anonymize TOR users? Yes. But the mechanism is incredibly expensive and not 100% reliable.
The only way a government like China could stop most people from using TOR would be to effectively ban most of the Internet from connecting to China. Needless to say, this would end up hurting the sate more than it could hope to gain from doing it.

Wealth is a subjective term. You naysayers keep arguing about Bitcoin as if there's some objective, absolute, measurable source of value or wealth. In reality, we ascribe relative and subjective "value" to everything from precious resources all the way to dumbass entertainment shit like fidget spinners. The only measure of value we have is how much something is worth relative to something else, which is discovered by trading. Hence why we compare the price of different products to get a sense for their relative value.
The idea that only certain types of economic activity are valuable (e.g. buying coffee versus trading Bitcoin) is silly and only makes sense if you have the unsupported belief a priori that only some kinds of transactions count as "wealth" producing. In real economic terms, all trade is considered economic activity and counts towards every measure of wealth we have, e.g. a country's GDP which is just the aggregate of all trade that is measured within the nation.
