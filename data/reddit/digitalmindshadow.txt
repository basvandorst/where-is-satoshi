I don't understand your question. His website itself wasn't at all dodgy, he sells coffee mugs. He was avoiding being served with a lawsuit unrelated to his website. In order to avoid being served, he moved to a different place, and went to great lengths to leave no forwarding address or any way to be tracked to his new residence. He hosted his website through a proxy, and initially registered with the proxy through a private P.O. box, which he subsequently cancelled. It worked pretty well.

That makes blu-ray better from the standpoint off the companies who were in charge of deciding which tech to adopt.

I got a D in calculus my first semester in college, being taught esoteric formulas by a professor who as far as I could tell did not speak any English. (To his credit as a human being, though perhaps not as an instructor, I think I got that D out of pity. I probably should have failed.) After getting pretty good grades all through high school, as a timid and emotionally troubled college freshman I was crushed by that experience. I never took another math course again. I did very well in the liberal arts majors that I chose, but gave up all hope of doing anything science-related in school or professionally (though I have always kept up with scientific developments and continue to be fascinated by it as a layperson).
A decade later I saw a video that made it click. Calculus is simply a way to find the area underneath a curved line. Why couldn't someone have explained that to me back when I was supposed to be learning the subject matter? I remember feeling similarly frustrated with my math courses all through high school. My math teachers focused exclusively on beating formulas into our heads, which I could just barely do without  any reference point or explanation of what I was doing or why. I learned a bunch of shortcuts and cheats to get answers to problems, though nobody could or would ever explain to me what they were about.
I really wish that my math instruction as a kid and young adult had included at least a little bit of explanation of what it was we were supposed to be learning. I recall spending a lot of time complaining that school was filled with useless information that I would never use. I was told to shut up and do my homework. Nobody ever even tried to explain how the information in my lessons might be useful after all. I think if they had, I might be a completely different person today.

FYI that's not really what that idiom means. "Beating a dead horse" is when you continue to try to do something that's futile due to multiple past attempts to do the same thing. Since this thread is the first time (to my knowledge) that anyone has tried to mock for that particular statement since Newegg started accepting BC, it doesn't really apply here.

26,675 people attended this game.

Less accurate.

That makes more sense I guess. Though the guy was posting 2 days ago.
@_date: 2014-12-28 15:31:08
He didn't say that anywhere. 
@_date: 2014-05-09 20:41:50
I know of someone who did something similar in order to avoid being served with legal process while still being able to operate his online business.

I would have gone with Jeff Bridges personally, but solid work.

Yes, on both desktop and mobile. On desktop there's an option within KeePass to autotype the username and password into the open browser window. On mobile, KeePass2Android includes a keyboard that auto-enters the information.

As someone who has never owned any bitcoin currency, I can testify that it seems pretty imposing and complicated.  Making it more accessible to us noobs can only support BC's success.

If you can buy goods with it, in what sense is it "fake"?
@_date: 2013-02-12 22:59:57
You can buy cupcakes with bitcoins at [this store](
Do you know of anywhere you can buy physical goods with WoW gold?

Plus isn't online gambling illegal in the U.S.?

That's okay, neither nor reddit generally are news sites.

No really, what could that possibly have to do with India's rate of bitcoin adoption?
@_date: 2013-03-20 09:18:12
That makes sense.  But why not accept bitcoin donations and immediately convert it in to USD?
