Last part is confusing. You'll take BTC "especially now that fees are going to be so much better?"
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:38:50
That is BCH "B" BTW.
@_date: 2018-01-20 01:33:16
You forgot hops.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:27:20
I know that's 540 total. But simple TX onchain is 258 bytes. Is LN TX bigger or default fees are higher than 1sat/byte?
@_date: 2018-01-19 21:46:53
$30+ for the next block confirmation fees happened on BTC. And will happen again. How are "other sub shills" wrong?
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:38:46
Though 1.7Mb is max. Am I wrong or smth changed?
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:18:44
Every month in a row.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:47:19
4Mb is weight, so size will be smaller. 
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:07:36
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:31:20
But LN is beta. LN is "new barely tested".
@_date: 2018-01-23 11:20:12
Fees will be dropping for the next 1.5 days. After difficulty retarget - rise again.
@_date: 2018-01-19 19:57:50
What fees are on LN? In the other thread 548sat. They can't be that big.
@_date: 2018-01-22 15:20:56
National banks or banks in the India?
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:54:10
Thank you very much.
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:39:38
Common posts are when someone did a TX that stuck in the mempool. But in such cases shillers don't waste opportunity to point about "too low fees" with links to "bad looking" mempool that basically explains all that load network, corresponding and stuff. Didn't they?
 I didn't read posts like you mentioned in months.
@_date: 2018-01-19 16:45:07
Fourth. Saw a LN screenshot with 546sat fees. Why 546? LN TX is bigger than regular?

Privat Bank listed BTC price on their main page in 2015. We were able to convert BTC inside bank account and even buy stuff online.

You'll need to open and close channels. Research that.

I wasn't able to withdraw 2 days ago. Went through enhanced verification from basic account in minutes. A'OK.

Bcash is not released yet. So, yes - no utility.

Did you try to launch with "-reindex"?
@_date: 2018-05-17 10:15:34
Sideways forever.
@_date: 2018-05-18 10:31:15
According to cash.coin.dance, there are 2190 BCH nodes.
@_date: 2018-05-13 11:41:09
It's optional on BCH and forced on BTC. What's your point?
@_date: 2017-12-29 02:03:26
Wrong sub to ask.
Just google it. 10 minutes.
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:55:37
Wait another 3-4 years?

You just gotta wait LN.

There wasn't enough hashrate to drive BTC difficulty up. Your scenario is not real.
@_date: 2017-11-04 21:12:01
Hey, I forgot about lending stuff, like Waves have. My bad... 1000+ nodes is centralized for you?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:37:29
Thanks. Agree. Do you you want to add adoption, asics cost and zero-fees cryptos to that scenario? They're running out of time to do that. Who else would spam? Bankers with governments? But Bitcoin is heading to the Wall Street. Other cryptos?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:34:35
 Bitnodes showing there are 12,5k nodes worldwide. What are those numbers in the link?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:03:29
Thx, now I know it was from 2015. That means 90% in 2015, 45% in 2016 and only 25-30% of nodes will shut down in 2017, according to Moore's law. And that is _with full blocks_, right?
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:25:03
@_date: 2017-11-10 20:16:43
Explain please.

FLDC+CURE. Mine medicine, not hashes.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:12:13
They will mine that coins sooner or later. If they mine sooner - they'll get less our $. I'm OK with that while Bitcoin price increasing enough to attract new people.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:52:39
Looks like he wants to increase fees by increasing number of transactions.
@_date: 2017-11-04 14:57:16
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:03:53
Why? Upgrading "software"?
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:57:05
Did Slush Pool start mining BCH? No. Then - BS. Was it so hard?
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:37:26
Just buy new BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:31:31
There are just 12% Segwit transactions. Don't wait - use. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 17:55:04
Newegg.com ?
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:52:29
There was quite loud statement at bitcoin.com that BCH is Bitcoin now and why. And another ones. If miners announce that they will switch to BCH as Bitcoin - it would be like 20th and final warning to go full BCH. How that can be called an attack? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:08:48
Actually, DCG invested in Blockstream. DCG invested in Bitpay and Coinbase too. How those 3 related to BCH except supporting BCH by their services?
@_date: 2017-11-16 21:15:18
They already know about high fees. What did you expect?
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:18:10
He's about BCH.
@_date: 2017-11-25 21:08:12
Was 2FA on?
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:58:14
It costs 8 times more to spam 8Mb network than 1Mb. And so on. Doubt is that even profitable. Do we have graph of that?
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:25:05
Backlog formed because of hashrate move.
@_date: 2017-11-04 19:02:51
So there will be less nodes than Lightning Network nodes? How many BTC is needed to run a Lighting Network node?
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:11:50
Agree about transaction speed as BTC have RBF. Everything else: why?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:58:47
You don't see Bitcoin on Wall Street in the first quater?
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:48:54
Why not every block like BCH will have on 13th?
@_date: 2017-11-07 08:52:08
That started at $5k.
@_date: 2017-11-22 19:23:08
There were no signs of BTC difficulty rise for the next period. We saw stable +-2%  retarget on fork.lol.
@_date: 2017-11-17 00:38:41
There were 10$ fees and higher. You can check that here: 
@_date: 2017-11-05 21:24:28
Oh, sorry. If there are not enough transactions - block size will be smaller than maximum. Not full. Could be same size as a small block.
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:13:02
If block size is big enough - averange fees should be 1 sat/byte. Where am I wrong?
@_date: 2017-11-12 18:42:52
1. They fixed that 3 weeks ago with DAA that goes live tomorrow.
2. More blocks do not harm user experience. 1800BTC should be mined today. Specially with that backlog.
3. Sooner halving - bigger price.
@_date: 2017-11-25 23:28:21
3 out 4 DCG board members related to banks. Morons?

Mempool backlog is FUD?

 A miner was spotted in his vlog back in the days.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:35:20
Is this one bigger than previous?
@_date: 2017-11-10 16:19:15
They just have a reason to post smth because of the dip. That's what newsmakers do.
@_date: 2017-11-30 17:13:59
Any given coin trades against BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:21:26
That is bots doing their thing to drive price in some way. That nothing to do with mentioned spam, backlog and DDoS.
@_date: 2017-11-02 09:41:14
Nothing new, besides adoption news.
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:21:46
I think turning BTC technically into smth that other alts already are could cause alts rise. Main global crypto should defeat banks and fiat, not fight with other cryptos.
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:16:22
Slighty more? It was up to like what 15 bucks at some point.
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:25:11
That is actually organic.
@_date: 2017-11-03 18:28:17
But we have 3 forks. Different governments or one of them just a distraction?
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:11:28
It won't last. Is it OK for a currency when user have to analyze backlog before using it?
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:18:54
He didn't say that. I'll translate that for you: We can't avoid centralization with Bitcoin model.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:26:41
2 hours ago you needed 20-25 sat/B fee.
@_date: 2018-03-19 22:36:49
BCH and LTC?
@_date: 2018-03-29 08:13:29
How about: low volume after last dip, never-ending futures, april 15th tax deadline.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:35:12
No one knows. You can try to guess using 
@_date: 2018-03-20 17:36:39
They are adding BCH to their exchange together with LTC.
@_date: 2018-03-31 04:39:13
Lol. BCH hardfork is exactly on the 15th of May when this cycle starts.
@_date: 2018-02-27 01:59:59

Up to 40k unconfirmed transactions is "normal" now?
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:39:24
Zoom out. It's normal.

He's with BCH, right? If Bitcoin Cash is real Bitcoin. That would be &gt;1850% more interesting.
