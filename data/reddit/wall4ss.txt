Oh, I'm not exiting any time soon and I probably wouldn't fully exit either. And if I do fully exit, it will be because I believe I can buy back in at lower prices. Blockchain isn't going anywhere, and it's still the best way to make a profit today. That is undeniable.
Whether or not the majority of people who as of now can't even open an account or get started with crypto are convinced is the question. Until your average Joe with no technical skills can open an account that isn't Coinbase and understand the fundamentals or have a way so they don't lose their entire wallet, it's unlikely imo.

Perhaps I should have put an OR instead of an AND? People who lose their jobs will still need to pay bills. I had just graduated high school when the recession hit and was working a shit job at a retail store. I was working alongside people in finance, real estate, and many who owned their own businesses when things went kaput. People were committing suicide left &amp; right or they had to take a job making $12 an hour to survive. There were guy's coming in with suits on to work at a home improvement store who were vastly overqualified because they were *desperate* to provide anything for their family as their 401k's and pension plans got pulverized.
The S&amp;P 500 went from $1400-1500 in 2007 to $735 in 2009 - the last time it was that low was in 1996. If you don't think Bitcoin would drop you're delusional and deserve to lose your money.

Were you an adult in 2008? That was the definition of panic selling. Think about what happened during the beginning of 2018 with crypto and that's basically what happened to the stock market. Yes, not everyone will sell but many people won't have the balls to sit on their dick while watching their investments crash to zero, nor have the balls to hold onto those investments until recovery. 
Greham's law also states (because it's a "law") that both currencies being compared must be considered of the same legal tender value. Tell me how 1 bitcoin, or even .000000001 bitcoin is legally equal to a dollar. This isn't gold or silver. It doesn't apply to bitcoin.
You got really offensive towards because why? Because it didn't fit in with your bitcoin maximalist views or something? So you call him an idiot and then rebuke his argument without even using facts? No one takes people like you seriously for a reason.

What do we do about lost coins, which are inaccessible? I lost the private key for a fairly large account (or rather, the private key no longer has proper security clearance). As of today, I owe $4500 for capital gains last year. I know that I can't claim it as a "loss" because I wasn't hacked, and the funds weren't stolen. How will this affect my future tax obligations? There is no way to access the account, unfortunately. I don't mind paying the gains this year, but I'm concerned about my future tax obligations.

Bitcoin isn't going here, the blockchain will exist as long as there are miners. I don't believe it will ever go to zero outside of some calamity or unforeseen event. Half of whatever it is during the crash? Sure. But it has a cult following now, and Satoshi is nearly a God to some people at this point.
I don't see how I'm in the minority, I can't seem to find the majority you speak of. Just making biased statements about "most people" and such doesn't convince me otherwise. Most financial advisors still don't even recommend BTC - so where is this majority you speak of? Crypto enthusiasts like you &amp; I? It's important to look outside of your own bubble. Crypto isn't main stream enough to have the power of gold or silver. Most people can't even create their own wallet without having their hands held through the process.

In recessions people typically pull out their investments to eat you know  
If you just lost your job and you're living paycheck to paycheck like many people do, you're gonna want to eat
