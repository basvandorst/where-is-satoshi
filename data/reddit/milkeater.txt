Stupidest thing I've ever read....


and then when suggesting an audit 


Maybe the best thing you could do is listen to what people are suggesting, make an effort to execute on it, and not blowing off the suggestion....either that or *don't ask questions which you are fishing specific answers for*

He has much to lose especially when you think of how much he has invested in securing his position. I think being tied to that would make him a target for unwanted attention

Sorry but that article was a worthless response to someone not in the technical deep dive.  
It sums up to..."Because some people spent their lives being smart and technical they are bad public speakers....and if anyone is a good public speaker they are technically ignorant...."
I've learned to be careful of those with excuses......bring on the hatemail....

Did you or did you note make a statement in the December 15th Board Meeting that


Are you or are you not the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation?
If you are not interested in doing something that seems clearly important to others regarding bitcoin foundation (not me saying this....I am reading post after post), then perhaps you could delegate it to someone within your foundation that would be willing to put this together....or is there no money left for that either?
I am surprised your Media Relations team is allowing you to go on this tirade....I hope you realize that you represent the Bitcoin Foundation whether you want to express your own opinion or not.
Being an Executive Director is not necessarily a position that gives you the immunity of saying:  **It happened before me, it couldn't have been me, I'm not responsible.  I don't care**
@_date: 2016-01-16 18:43:32
Well shit...
Thanks, I didn't realize we were there.  
Do you think this helps or hurts what is currently going on?  
I realize people who may be more gullible in the market, or just not paying attention may panic and make rash decisions, but do you feel capitalizing on their ignorance will only hurt the community in the long run and incentivize manipulation of the market?

Interesting opinion you got from this article....
That is what we are talking about afterall....how this article is or is not an expert opinion....
@_date: 2016-03-05 22:21:08
What a brilliant article.  
Kudos to you  your english was just fine and your point was clear.  
I would love to learn more about the research you have found while analyzing the blockchain.

Hundreds of gigabytes....I love just random numbers thrown around.....
"There will be Yotta Byes of frivolous transactions people!"
In the past year it's grown 25GB at an average of some 100-150k transactions per day (Spitballing here) and we currently sit at 53GB without any type of pruning of orphans am I right?  
There are people with much more accurate numbers having much more factual based conversations to deal with your super hyped FUD...calm down and have a realistic conversation and maybe you can get some traction, otherwise you are just trying to add to the frenzy.
**EDIT: 53GB...off by 4**
@_date: 2016-01-23 12:55:47
Well put
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:46:34
Why are you even the Executive Director of the Bitcoin Foundation?  
If a single Director made a statement like this during a time when they were fighting to stay alive they would be crucified.  
Volunteer!  You are on the Executive Board!  If at your position you cannot lead others on an effort that would not only help you establish authority and control of a snowball but hopefully a little order and trust...then you are in my opinion the wrong person for the job.  
I can lead others to accomplish work and it takes almost zero of my time other than receiving a status update and pushing deadlines.  You have either no control, or no organization....either one is a huge problem with what you appear to be facing.

How would you necessarily go about shorting bitcoin?  I realize how you can short stocks, but are you just talking about off the books betting on future prices?

How fitting.  A doctor who knew that people not washing their hands was causing more and more deaths but was a complete asshole about it was not beleived and eventually beaten to death in an Insane Asylum....but he was right all along, although it wasn't the popular opinion among doctors....
[Dr Semmelweiss]( 
Your argument holds no water.  The majority doesn't mean correct, and I am not saying one side or another, I am just saying....being intelligent is not an excuse for "We aren't good at getting our point across in a publicly relatable or understandable way".  
I just thought it was a weak article that was just as whiny as the other side.
@_date: 2016-01-04 03:57:50
Amazingly you respond like this....as well as almost every other response in these chains....I am not even remotely surprised and it just makes you look aggressive and childish.
You avoid the whole point....you came here asking for advice....someone gave it to you and you didn't like it.  
The transparency of money seems like the lynch pin of many of the problems here, hell the post is titled **Where did all the Money Go?**, but volunteering your time to solve something that you are deeply wrapped up in


Classic case of: 
You: *I'll tell you anything you want to know to prove I'm being honest*
Anyone Else: **Asks Question**
You:  *Now why the hell would you want to know the answer to a stupid question like that*

Sorry for some reason when I read this it had only shown me the first half of the comment the 'half-sarcastic/serious'.
I was treating this like the half-calf decaf coffee type of statement...jokingly of course.  
I agree with you that the price will have a lot of potential to swing forward.  I feel like there is a lot of posturing from privatized groups to push the price further down and create chaos.....this may or may not be on the line of conspiracy theory, but when big money gets involved, especially government related entities, I feel like all the rules keep seeming to go right out the window.  
If they can drive it down they may think that they can discourage the cryptocurrencies survival....maybe I'm hopeful, maybe I'm optimistic, but I feel this has set itself to deeply to be just eschewed away.  
That being said someone had pointed me towards bitfinex.com which actually allows you to short positions on bitcoin.  I figured it may be worth looking into although I'm surely not the only one with this idea.

Split in two gives the implication that they were halved...this may be a slightly disingenuous explanation.  
@_date: 2016-01-17 04:39:55
You are commenting on this guys article....I guess maybe clarification could have been added on your part...but I see what you are saying 
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:24:30
There is overlap in Bitcoin and BitTorrent because they are P2P....well I guess Tim Berners-Lee is a fucking God here then....
@_date: 2016-01-04 04:33:48




You don't even waste time to contradict yourself.
Here is a really rich one:




So I think what you meant to say in your final statement was:
*Please give me feedback that I will not act on unless I wholeheartedly agree with it.  What can an organization do to move forward that doesn't involve digging up and analyzing the past?*
You are sincerely embarrassing yourself.  Please just stop.

You literally didn't read what I wrote simple a line.....Semmelweiss was right all along.  The majority (who could have been considered experts) were wrong.  They were not the ones who beat him, just a sad ending of how he died.  
Now we practice washing our hands in hospitals before surgery.  It all comes out in the wash.
Furthermore I wish you would have read a single line lower 


Not sure what is so hard for you to understand about that....my argument....I make no argument, just put out a comment that the article was just as whiny as the other side.
@_date: 2016-01-17 01:31:33
You gave the most ignorant reason to listen to someones opinion.  Bitcoin is immensely more than merely P2P.  
Short of finding other nodes in the network, they diverge into completely different subjects in behavior and even reasons for existing.  
Granted someone creating a P2P filesharing network, even better being the first, is clearly likely capable of learning and understanding the complexities in bitcoin potentially....if he was completely ignorant of Cryptography his opinion would be worth crap....
You just made a very very weak parallel and it was too easy to jump on.
@_date: 2016-01-17 06:37:55
Excellent expert opinion....that sums it all up right there...lol glhf

Aren't they really milking this article.....why not let the conversation flow from the original, or are they implying it didn't have the impact they were looking for...
There are a lot of things out there really seeming to try and slam Bitcoin.  Just saw one about a Documentary....just a little bit over the top don't you think....so suddenly

You didn't know Sherlock Holmes participated in the bitcoin?

I agree with this.  It keeps coming to this statement of "This was a known issue" etc etc....
The DAO, Smart Contracts, and the Blockchain can be advanced topics for most people and the amount of misinformation out there is plentiful enough.  Research and understanding will make it harder to digest and go viral but....it's a pretty big deal.
When I was in the military after I returned home from deployment, we all had a huge extra chunk of money.  One guy invested 10k in penny stocks.  It went up 3 - 4 cents and he sold it.  He obviously made plenty and a ton of people followed behind him.....they all lost everything.  I didn't feel bad for them then, it's hard to feel bad for people now.  
Security was one reason I held off on the DAO

Way to step up.

Are F2Pool, Antpool &amp; BTCC Pool **effectively one pool due to validationless mining** and **are they** launching a blockwithholding attack at the network right now?
Didn't validate the blockwithholding but considering your clickbait title, I'll do a little research before going whole hog.
Edit: Formatted as a question instead of a statement

Why would new miners join a handicapped system...
It's econonmics and more precisely incentives.  What's the incentive to stay in a system where the difficulty is high representing such a large mining pool, when they are actually gone....you have the same probability of the reward as if they were there, until the next difficulty adjustment.

Completely untrue. I can lend based on risk. The lower the risk, the more competitive I must make the interest regardless of others in the pot. Your risk is not relative to someone else beyond the fact of it relating to an entities risk portfolio.
If everyone is guaranteed to pay their debts I only need to offer slightly more than growth and overhead. It is risk you are adjusting for.
@_date: 2016-09-15 19:24:54
Are you trying to indicate there is no way to differentiate because I assure you there is. 
Surely with Machine Learning techniques there will be ever more precise methods but there are a ridiculous amount of businesses that do exactly that.
I would argue it is the most prevalent driver in most major businesses

I  think the thing I love about this the most is you have an iron clad form of proof. If you cannot provide that, nobody believes you and we move on with our lives.
Crazy antics get no love. I am sad to see Gavin not leverage the resounding logic Vitalik as well as others were sharing. Sign the message and show everyone or gtfo.

Wouldn't that get out of control quickly?
I imagine someone could create a program to handle this, it just seems like a lot.  
I realize we are tossing the proverbial ball around, but it is helping me understand deeper and deeper.

There is nobody that could have given him the 450 Million unless he was Satoshi...its like claiming you own a locked bank vault that can only be opened with a password. Regardless of whether everyone believes or not, it's only being unlocked by the person with the password (or key in this case).
I think the Fiat world vs crypto world difference is how quickly he was proven (imo) wrong and what his motives (or appearance of) were.
There is an inherent layer of transparency that was reinforced by these events.

So a soft fork to a new pub/key algo.  
Would that algo be anything not leveraging the Lamport Signature?  
I had found this link in Stack Overflows [Cryptography]( thanks to your pointer.  I suppose I'm just too far out of my depth to understand.  I thought we were using merkle trees already.

Right?  People were illegally getting guns long before the dark net.  It is another distribution channel, not necessarily the source.
Considering what they did within Silk Road, they've already shown it's a matter of time before they find a way.  
Natural progression of whack-a-mole that crime is synonymous with.  Break up this operation, it rebrands and becomes that operation.

Every time I drink with my friends I find myself talking about the potential balance that the blockchain can deliver to a world that has little to no self-control....
At least the coverage makes me seem slightly less crazy.....but definitely still alienated.
@_date: 2016-07-24 14:24:55
The truth....
Creating a media frenzy and then push bills and laws that graze over the crypto world.  Look at the people who don't understand cryptocurrencies trying to find a table within legislation *ahem Perianne Boring* 
They'll be easily tricked no matter how good their intentions.
