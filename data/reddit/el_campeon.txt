Considering the potential of DACs; you don't think having a platform to monetize work of a collaborative nature such as on github or relationships like on Freelance or Odesk would be valuable?
If I contract someone on Odesk in India from the US and they fail to deliver, what court is going to help me with my claim?

No, Keyhotee is much more robust.

"I've seen lots of "DAC" ideas around here that seem to totally miss the point. The purpose of a DAC is to cause the emergent behavior of a large network of people to behave in a way that a centralized entity could not, while adding value for all participants. Most of what I've seen is just "let's take this business model and put it on a blockchain" - almost always it seems *worse* than a centralized solution.
So here's the litmus test: Which social dillemma is your DAC addressing, and which payoff matrix is flipped as a result of adding the blockchain?
For BTS DNS: Each individual benefits from having squatted a successful domain, while the collective as a whole suffers from the lack of available domains. By the auction/dividend model, it is now *more profitable not to squat than to squat*."
For BTS X: It is *more profitable* to participate in the market peg than to fight it.
For Bitcoin: It is *more profitable* to be an honest miner than a dishonest miner.
