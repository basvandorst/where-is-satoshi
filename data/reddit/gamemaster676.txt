Kraken and coinbase do follow the law, but like he said are also blocked.

Okay, the translations here are in my opinion not complete. Let me try to give some more information.
Of the four people around the table, two want to 'get in'. They admit they only have a little understanding of the underlying tech. They just want to be a part of this, whatever is going to happen. That is why these two are going to enter on Wednesday. It doesn't matter what the current price will be or do after that.
The other two are extremely skeptical and are repeating the same phrases you hear in every country all over the world. ("It's going to crash", Rockefeller quote about "Shoe shine boy investing").


I would actually translate what the guy meant as: "I know there is a blockchain and bitcoin **seems to be** an extension of it"  
He freely admits he doesn't know all the details.


They were talking about the unpredictability of bitcoins value, and how there are sudden rises and drops on seemingly random moments.

It's the origin of OPs statement

The gold does not disappear, but if people stopped caring about gold, it's value could be zero.
The same could be true for bitcoin.
Always be vigilant and only invest what you are willing to lose.

I helped too

And I litteraly just bought 0.3 before it happened. Fml :(
@_date: 2017-08-15 10:08:27
What happened?

Thank you for the answer. 
If I use an online wallet like Blockchain. Would that be safe, or could I make it safe by exporting something?

Thanks for this. I just remembered I also had an account on a mining pool and it was Slush pool. I never withdrawed my bitcoin after mining a couple of years ago.
Turns out the worth has risen to $0,04 now...

Remember that 5000 will only be applicable to some countries. 
- It has already passed 5000 CAD. 
- Once it reaches 5000 USD, it won't be 5000 EUR yet. 
- Once it reaches 5000 EUR, it won't be 5000 GBP yet. 
Every comparison between bitcoin and fiat has it's own milestones, so it is improbable bitcoin will drop after it reached a milestone.

When you sell gold, the other party buys gold.  
When you buy gold, the other party sells gold.
The buy and sell price are always equal. It's shady 'sell your gold' shops that decide to give you less than what it is worth.

Bitcoin beginner here. Why should we not leave it on an online exchange?

Banks only loan you money when you don't need it
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:13:48
Cash out, as in 'convert to fiat'?
You wouldn't need to do do that if they accept bitcoin :)

Don't know if it's the case here, but the chairs in most sports cars have upstanding edges to keep you in the seat. They don't really allow you to rotate.

Sorry if I appear ignorant, but in all my reading here I have never seen an actual reason why people want to put their pitchforks to 2x.
Could someone please explain to me why many/some/all people are against 2x? 
I would think a (slightly) larger blocksize helps keeping the costs low, while keeping the storage requirements low as well. Is this not the case?

Everywhere around me (in europe) the switches go on in the up position. With the idea you turn the light 'up' or 'down'.
It's possible the switches in your house are installed upside down?
