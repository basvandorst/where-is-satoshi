The fuck? Venezuela is the richest country in the world in terms of oil resources. It could have rivalled Norway in terms of wealth. But instead of rich and prosper it's what it is. If you give Maduro the gold it will just disappear.

No, what you are thinking of is signature aggregation. Schnorr is just an alternative signature scheme. Without signature aggregation no one would be interested in Schnorr as ECDSA already does what it's intended to do.
That being said signature aggregation is experimental and the cryptographic primitives untested/not well understood. If you take the time it takes for well understood concepts to make their way into Bitcoin as a reference, sigagg is probably &gt;5 years away.

LN currently uses source routing. Each node needs to know the **entire network graph**. When ever a tx is being sent your node uses one of the common graph traversal algorithms I imagine something basic like breadth first (I doubt it bothers with fee minimization and single source shortest path algorithms)
Either way, once the LN graph contains millions of nodes and even more edges you'd need a data center to route your payments. Ant routing is basically a distributed breadth first search algorithm with dual origin. Each node only knows its adjacent nodes and nothing else.
Assuming the algorithm offers a scaling improvement I'm curious to know how anonymization of paths is intended to work. Still watching atm.

The Bitcoin network isn't congested. It's working exactly as it always has finding new blocks every 10 minutes. Bump the fee to get a 10min conf. I don't see under which circumstance I could call that congested. Is the local restaurant congested when I go there with 10 cents and they don't give me a burger worth 10USD but instead tell me to wait until they throw out the scraps?

There is no maximum on unconfirmed transactions I can define a billion tx and they would all sit in the mempool without confirmation.
Much like bitcoins themselves block space is a scarce and valuable resource. Whether you agree with that doesn't matter because that is what has been decided by the majority of participants on the Bitcoin network.
What happens with increased usage isn't "congestion"  [block]( [choke]( [clog]( [clot]( [dam]( [gum (up)]( [jam]( [obstruct]( [occlude]( [plug (up)]( [stop (up)]( [stuff](  The network continues to function exactly the way it has for the last 10 years. What happens with increased usage is a reduction of use cases. The minimum fee required for inclusion in a block just sets a minimum viable transaction size. I'd say a viable transaction would have to be an order of magnitude above the min. tx fee.
This is simply  what it takes to transact on Bitcoin. If your use case has lower priority, lower demand for security then just use BCH or Litecoin or Dogecoin or LN. Stop being a pathetic &lt;insert one coin&gt; maximalist. It makes you reek of desperation for a one coin world dominance get rich quick scheme.
Different coins serve different use cases it's about time people started figuring that out.
