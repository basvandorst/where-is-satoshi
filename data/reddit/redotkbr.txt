I believe this is its biggest weakness. Currencies are traded and valued against each other using  supply and demand. Factors that influence a currency's supply and demand are differential inflation rates, differential interest rates, and Government/Central Bank intervention. When currency exchange occurs, these are factors that are used to predict movements. This is what allows investors to do their "research." In the case of Bitcoin, none of these factors have an effect on its supply and demand. So "research" really turns into trying to gauge market psychology. Bitcoin only has value because there is a buyer and a seller willing to pay currency (centralized) for it.
Not to mention the substantial risks involved not mitigated by government policy.

weakness: 
1. an inability to forecast or conduct research. (stated above)
2. Centralized systems have policy in affect to protect participants. No one is going to go to jail for taking your bitcoins and exchanges have disappeared over night. 


this is a broad statement subject to confirmation bias.
Venezuela pegged the Bolivar to the USD in 2010. This, along with nationalization of industry, mismanagement of their oil wealth, and subsidizing programs to end poverty, has caused the Bolivar to devalue 50 percent. Nationalization creates shortages and surpluses. This is a basic argument against communism.  You threw in a few straw men in there.
As for the real estate market. Greed. That is what I see here. The people playing the game passed the hot potato to joe schmoe and the music stopped.
can you tell me what types of analysis or models you are using in your research?

I keep hearing, "do your research." The more I research, the more this thing starts to fall apart.
