How many backups do you think the banks have? They can't even keep tracks of signatures for home mortgage documents, money owed to them; you think they have backups of ledgers for money they owe you? And do you even have cryptographic proof of the money they owe you?

Also in the TOS:
"The token has been issued to you without reduction of or other release or waiver of any claims you may have against the Bitfinex Group."
Since Bitfinex wrote the terms of service, any contradictions in the terms of service would be interpreted by a court in favor of the other parties, and against Bitfinex. That is how you end up effectively doubling your debt.
And that doesn't even begin to touch on the fact that the distribution of losses and the BFX tokens terms of service are in violation of previous terms of service and have been foisted upon customers under duress and without consent. As a result they don't represent a valid contract whatsoever.

BFX tokens have pretty nonsensical terms. One of those terms though is that US persons are not allowed to acquire them. How many tokens have already been invalidated by US persons trading them?

Yes. That's because people with enough money and skill to make a living off trading have income at stake if Bitfinex closes.

Even if you are correct, markets are efficient. If some miners decide only to mine during the time of day when fees are high, then we truly have a fee market at last. What we have may be relatively rare in economics - a supply that is elastic in the short term but inelastic in the mid to long term due to difficulty adjustment. You should expect hash rate to vary with the fee bounty if some miners are working on the margins - whether in terms of marginal costs or opportunity cosyts.
Also there is rumor that some miners only run their rigs at fractional capacity depending on temperature this summer.
I'm not convinced that it's not just statistical noise though.
@_date: 2016-08-21 04:27:14
Bitcoin already has most of that. Not reversible transactions, but time lock and scripts that can specify a default send address. Bitfinex was being stupid with their setup, settling accounts every day when they had 28 days even by the regulations they were trying to follow. A zero- confirmation transaction broadcast to Chinese miners could be effective delivery so they could have waited 14, 21, or even 27+ days - saving transaction fees and keeping daily outbound or even total transaction limits to previous hot wallet levels.

The timing estimates on bank transfers are not reliable in my experience. They can come early, late, in different order than expected. Trying to read up and understand the background of how ACH transfers work hasn't added much clarity I think they place a hold and then later get the transfer. Is physical cash moved around? I have no idea. I'm pretty sure that banks have to settle underlying liquid assets they invest in before moving the money electronically, so if your bank has met outflows of cash that day or that week it could take longer as they have to sell stocks or bonds or something.
The website issues or internal technical difficulties in Coinbase could affect this too, as they need to communicate with the ACH network to request finalizing the transfer. Downtime could create backlog.

Monero does six month rolling hardforks no problem. It allows consensus to implement new features within a year no matter what. The problem with Ethereum is that they had no social contract about timelines for hardforks and then rolled one out real fast without adequate preparation, with people not updating able to jump onto the other chain by default. Bitcoin Core is in a more similar situation to Monero than to Ethereum as old clients would go into safe mode if they detect a long chain with invalid transactions - or so is my understanding, I haven't examined the relevant source code adequately to confirm. So after a hardfork old clients will know to update. The main problem is that there are many wallets, so it's not clear what old versions of each one would do without testing or examing their code.

Move some but not all money out of business accounts daily in case account gets closed for excessive cash transactions, perhaps to Chase Bank or your favorite brokerage. Simultaneously get verified at every major exchange/service that accepts US persons (or whichever country you have residency/citizenship), such as Coinbase/GDAX, Bitstamp, etc. Link the exchanges to another (personal or business) bank account, read up on policies for incoming international wire transfers, make sure some kind of bank transfer (ACH/wire/whatever) is enabled on both ends. Dump $10k- $25 k per day at each exchange in like $1k chunks, maybe do some spread trading on top of it, withdraw in $10k- $25k chunks depending on exchange and bank policies.

I much prefer wallets that allow an override. I know how to calculate transaction fees, and my transactions are rarely time sensitive.

Coinbase lets you link three bank accounts plus a PayPal account and a number of debit/credit cards. I think bank accounts are the only ones that allow two- way transfer of fiat. If you are withdrawing fiat though you could send to PayPal and link unlimitted bank accounts to PayPal. Also I haven't needed to do this yet but employer tax identification numbers can be requested from IRS at a rate of one per day per person and used together with a state business license (the real bottleneck) to open a business account without using SSN. The weakest link is probably your relationship with Coinbase itself, or the government. Maybe they are concerned about Chinese espionage?

They only need to sign a cold storage address once. If they are afraid of leaking cryptographic data such as public key they could sign with the hot wallet addresses that sent money to cold storage.

Very likely the hackers were positioned to profit from the price swing and don't need to move or liquidate the stolen coins. They may also have bought BFX tokens since the difference between nominal and market prices is larger than the bounty. Alternatively they may be waiting for decentralized markets to mature - either in terms of reliable anonymity/security or in terms of liquidity - so they can do as you describe without anyone tracing it. Also possible they will use the coins - after half- way laundering them - for further market manipulation rather than directly cashing out.

Yes it's ridiculous that people who loaned bitcoin for margin trading - and thus had their bitcoin backed mostly by USD collateral - should be treated the same as USD lenders who had mostly bitcoin for collateral, and bitcoin borrowers, buyers, and holders. I think someone who shorted bitcoin at 3x leverage - and has full USD collateral to cover that - should have to pay back the guy he borrowed from 100% before withdrawing anything himself. If Bitfinex lets margin borrowers walk off with money belonging to margin lenders, the lawsuits might not stop at Bitfinex. The lenders could sub poena records and go after the margin lenders personally. Bitfinex isn't doing anybody any favors if socialized losses opens up their customers to lawsuits from each other.

Quite possible - and/or others are speculating that the hacker is doing this. Buy up most of the BFX then anonymously return the stolen goods. He/they will have made money in three ways:

(3) Bounty on hacked coins.

2% is "ideal" because it matches the money supply increase of gold and so removes the need to hoddle gold for inflation protection. Excessive gold hoddling for speculation is bad because it's easier to conduct commerce with cash and electronic currency. Bitcoin though can be easier - already is for some use cases - so Bitcoin potentially abolished the "ideal" inflation rate, and also increase money velocity (banks don't allow money to be re-trasmitted multiple times per week, much less 6 times per hour). The ideal inflation for a national currency will be to match the money supply increase of the lower of gold or Bitcoin. That is soon (post- halving) to be about 2% and 4%. In five years though Bitcoin will control. In ten years ideal inflation will be under 1%. However violating that ideal won't hurt the economy like it does under the current (unofficial, market driven) gold standard, but merely push it towards Bitcoin adoption, where money will cease to loose value while becoming even more liquid.

The terms on the tokens indicate that accepting them does not imply any release of claims or liability. So you can sell your tokens and now they just doubled their debt. They still owe you the money they lost/stole, and they owe it again to the guy who bought the token. Considering they have people on staff who are known to do insider trading it would probably hold up in any reasonable court proceedings that the tokens are an outright scam, or that a reasonable person would have assumed such. So Bitfinex now is in debt 2% of all bitcoins in circulation rather than 1% that was originally taken. Long on bitcoin, short on bitfinex.

Even based on the factors that drive Fiat value, consensus (in the  nontechnical sense) being reached between major Chinese, American, and European players is significant. It legitimizes Bitcoin as an international unit of account rather than a local pyramid scheme.

Inflation is also bad because it encourages consumption of scarce, non-renewable resources. By being equally or more scarce than natural resources, Bitcoin requires real return on investment to justify risk, not fake inflation-driven numbers. Bitcoin stops deforestation, top soil degradation,  and desertification by making long term value more important than short term returns. This effect hasn't shown up yet though because adoption isn't widespread and money supply increase is still over gold's 2% per year and real estate's (inflation-adjusted) 1% per year value appreciation. In 10 years this effect could become substantial when instantaneous rate of Bitcoin money supply increase becomes provably more deflationary than historical inflation-adjusted real estate price trends.

On the one hand the price of Bitcoin is below the price at time of hack, so it's not too late for them to become bitcoin solvent. They also supposedly have enough assets to cover 10% of losses so price of bitcoin would have to hit about $665 for them to become borderline insolvent. 
On the other hand, if lawsuits freeze their bank assets they might not be able to buy bitcoin from other exchanges.
Anyway all they need to do is magically recover the magically stolen bitcoins, buy up all the BFX tokens at market prices while announcing bad news, then announce recovery and force redemption on the rest.

This cracks me up because Coinbase is pretty much the only company that allows you to buy and sell bitcoin at spot price with no fees. GDAX has zero percent makers fees and bank transfers in and out are free. Bitcoin transfers out are likewise free. Transfers between Coinbase and GDAX also free. An incomplete bank transfer is about as secure as a zero-conf transaction so I don't know how Coinbase even makes this work at 1.5%.
The problem here isn't that Coinbase doesn't offer fee free service. The problem is that people want instant buys on credit for free, people want to take liquidity for free, and want a flawless web interface for free. If you wait for bank transfers to clear before buying and use post only limit orders on GDAX you get no fees.

Unlike Localbitcoins, Paxful is a registered MSB  (money service business) with FinCEN so you should be OK if this is in the USA. Mostly where people get in trouble is using LocalBitcoins to do things that Paxful doesn't allow like in person transactions. More generally though Paxful as both the bitcoin escrow and an MSB have some AML/KYC obligations which LocalBitcoins avoids by being an unlicensed foreign/overseas company and LocalBitcoins this is putting the onus of knowing and following local laws onto customers.
Tl;Dr It's probably OK because Paxful operates within the American regulatory environment unlike LocalBitcoins.

My suggestion is to install Tor and Core and a torrent program and whatever else you need (Tails?) on a USB then to avoid using up your own bandwidth take a spair device to a hot spot and download the blockchain, bootstrap with torrenting maybe, and switch hot spots if it slows down or whatever. Once done make a backup so you never have to repeat and then keep updating at 1 MB/ minute over you usual Tor connection.

I think we should would have a flex cap cost tied to the mining reward.   Whatever the mining reward is - that should be the cost to add an extra MB. Over 2MB should require the miner to burn coins. All these should be added back to other miner rewards over next 210000 empty blocks - prorated for blocks between 0 MB and 1 MB. The 1MB cap could then be raised based on average past 210000 blocks. This allows nodes to plan about 4 years in advance for hardware size increases while making transaction size quite flexible.

Scary scenario:
(a) Blocks fill up.
(b) Lightning networks increasingly contract with miners to monopolize transactions.
(c) Non-contracted parties are frozen out of transactions both in terms of fees and by being ignored by the 100% contract bound mining pools.
(d) Bitcoin can only be bought through banks/exchanges using lightning network to transfer between them, and bitcoin aren't usable in a personal wallet.
(e) Banks decide together to do fractional reserve; for every Bitcoin on the books each can sell 2. These will be kept off-chains or a fork engineered such that Bitcoin doubles into two usable blockchains - one requiring cosigning by the banking cartel so personal wallets can't get the split. 
(f) If any bank  suffers a run they will be loaned Bitcoin Original by whichever bank has excess reserves, in return for a corresponding amount of Bitcoin Cartel. Only if over 50% of Bitcoin (100% of Bitcoin original) is withdrawn to (now unusable) personal wallets can the fractional reserve be exposed. This of course is impossible since banks own the other 50% to begin.
(g) Rinse and repeat over time for unlimited inflation.

In principle high fees could interfere with adoption. In practice Bitcoin       is way cheaper to transmit than fiat, gold, diamonds, etc. Western Union and wire transfers are pricy, fees on debit or credit cards, although sometimes obfuscated, are also higher.
The real problem is that if Bitcoin goes to the moon the value of fees may go to the moon. Fortunately there are multiple solutions in the pipeline, and higher fees would likely speed adoption of those solutions. Wire transfers and  Western Union on the other hand have no plans for addressing high fees.

Bots are competing over a narrowing price range, dragging the rest of the market with them into low volatility. Bots can make some profit on narrow but frequently fluctuating ranges, just barely larger than twice (i.e. buy+sell) commission on liquidity provider. If Bitcoin trades in a narrower range on all relevant time scales than some other bot-tradable commodity for long enough then some of the bot money will leave eventually, or less will enter. This presupposes that the bot operators are rationally trading just for trading profits. If they are part of some larger Bitcoin operation or operated by hoddlers trying to lower volatility to make Bitcoin appealing, then they might remain profitable or well funded without trading profits.

Most cash actually has drug residues on it. So it's not merely that most drug trades are done for cash (which is true) nor that proportionately the Bitcoin economy is involved less in drugs than the cash economy (especially if you only count cash transactions, not electronic Fiat money), more importantly if you handle cash you are being exposed to unknown chemical and drug residues, maybe even STD's and bodily fluids.

Some traders expect the price to run away from the larger wall, so a market maker can influence price by creating orders to make one wall larger, and if it doesn't work then cancel those orders before they are filled. However it doesn't work well repeatedly because it's easy to take a snapshot of order book and then later compare volume/price history or even detailed history of market fills if available to detect cancelled orders. If somebody is playing the order book often then traders would take that into consideration. More importantly it's difficult for market makers to win any bet since they are always exposing their hand, so they might play cat and mouse games more to conceal their real positions than to manipulate. I haven't implemented any such concealment myself, but I'm a small player.

It will be a slow supply shock just like with the last halving. The price won't suddenly double, but it will start to increase as the amount of Bitcoin being hoddled away or lost remains the same, while the amount being mined is cut in half. Price begins to creep up over a few months, and soon there is a bull market. Any news, good or bad, causes price to increase. A bubble form, collapses. The market consolidates as traders profit off the huge volatility generated by speculators. Eventually prices stabilize again by competitive traders narrowing their target prices in reaction to collective action of each other. Stabile prices attract a second bull market and bubble, even higher. Then things go bonkers for a few years until prices stabilize just months before the next halving.

This is pretty stupid. There are at least two ways to solve this without changing the Bitcoin protocol. (1) Consider zero confirmation transactions as complete (easy!).

You force confirmation by stacking transactions, using the transaction fees from withdrawals to compensate for low transaction fee deposits. Then you only have to wait on average for 10 minutes after the last withdrawl for the deposits to get confirmed, and more importantly the scammer gets charged when he doesn't expect.

Satoshi Nakomoto: We are all Satoshi. I am not ____. 
'Sato "I am Nash" Koto' is an anagram of his pseudonymn. Sato a common Japanese game like John in America.  Koto the national instrument of Japan, paralleling the commonality of the surname Nash in American music. 
The creator is unknown, but evidence points to John Nash, a man credibly more interested in the big picture than his personal enrichment. His stash goes untouched since his involvement ends in development. Yet his email denies certain specific identifications, even after John Nash dies. The cryptic denials worded as to imply a collective now in possession of the email.
'Tomo ko nashi tosa', his pseudonyms spelled backwards in Japanese syllobary, translates to 'And without this both' (would Bitcoin be as trusted?)

"Replace-by-fee should be supported by most of the wallets people are using before it is supported by the network."
How could a wallet support a feature that isn't supported by the network?? CoinJoin has been supported by the network from the beginning and the best wallet for that feature lacks a graphical user interface. Implementation must be supported by the network first, otherwise it is impossible. And lack of support (supply) does not imply lack of demand.

I never took shapeshift seriously enough to learn how to use it. First, they specialize in altcoin conversions, but network effect and portfolio management imply that Bitcoin is more valuable relative to its market cap and thus the best buy. Add in game theory and one should expect altcoin prices to trend towards zero and so should only be used for immediate utility, if any, not store of value. Second, Shapeshift claimed not to hold user funds but obviously this was not the case - as demonstrated to you now. So I was right not to believe that was the case. Since I considered their claims lies I didn't use them - much as I don't use Wall of Coins because I consider them to lie about fees. In both cases I find it odd that people make transparently false claims and other people don't consider it a lie because it's transparent(ly false).

Actually it's the miners who decide.  The miners decide Core versus Classic and when BIPS are implemented.  The developers only make proposals.  Satoshi didn't even limit the money supply, he just said that he did. There was a bug that would have started printing more bitcoins after they were supposed to stop being issued, except for a BIP. So in order to preserve the spirit of Satoshi's vision the letter of the code had to be changed.

From Wikipedia article on "Money Multiplier", retrieved earlier today:
"Although the money multiplier concept is a traditional portrayal of fractional reserve banking it has been criticized as being misleading. The Bank of England and the Standard &amp; Poor's rating agency (amongst others) have issued detailed refutations of the concept together with factual descriptions of banking operations. [3] [4] Several countries (such as Canada, the UK, Australia and Sweden) set no legal reserve requirements.[5] Even in those countries that do (such as the USA), the reserve requirement is as a ratio to deposits held, not a ratio to loans that can be extended. [6] Under the Basel III global regulatory standard, it is the level of bank capital that determines the maximum amount that banks can lend.[7] Basel III does stipulate a liquidity requirement to cover 30 days net cash outflow expected under a modeled stressed scenario (note this is not a ratio to loans that can be extended) however liquidity coverage does not need to be held as reserves but rather as any high-quality liquid assets [8] [9]"
In other words, bank don't just print money after getting your deposit. They take your deposit, invest it in the stock market or real estate or something, then use that (presumably profitable on average)  asset as backing for freshly printed money.  Wait. What?!?
Maybe they'll invest some in Bitcoin.

First you need to learn about computer programming and all things cypher punk. Then you decide whether you want a sustainably profitable business model or a pump and dump scheme.

It seems intuitively obvious that:
(A) One needs a substantial fraction of hashing power to make selfish mining work profitably. Naively 51%, but perhaps slightly less with some sophistication and other advantage. The problem is that though you might so.etimes get 2 blocks ahead all of a sudden, the rest of the network could with greater probability catch up all of a sudden.
(B) Selfish mining, if discovered, could lead other to leave a pool, and other miners to deliberately orphan your blocks whenever two equally valid blocks are discovered. This considerations would revert back to requiring 51%.

The Satoshi stash gives a warning system for a breach of encyption, say by a quantum computer, because it is large, stagnant, and slightly weaker encryption than the current client's single signature implementation. It protects your bitcoin by telling you when/if stronger encryption will be needed. Gold costs 1%-2% per year to store and insure. The inflation risk of the Satoshi stash, averaged over time, is tiny in comparison. It will likely be spendable by the NSA first, and the US government has shown no qualms in stealing Bitcoin.

This is how I calculate my fees. First I set up the transaction as a .0001 Bitcoin fee transaction, but don't submit it, just check how many input and outputs or the exact size in bytes if my wallet has that available. Rule of thumb about 256 bytes for simple one input two output transaction, so scal from that based on number of inputs (hashes) and outputs (addresses) if you must. Then go to this webpage, decide how long you want to wait divide by some safety factor, pick something that will definitely clear in that time, then multiple the fee per byte by number of bytes, multiply by a safety factor, and you got your santoshi. Then divide by 10^8 to get Bitcoin. Update your transaction fee. Repeat until it converges.

Each player can only win as much as other players can lose, namely their chipstack. Also, one need not provide insurance for oneself.

What is the mark-up or "organic fee" for a first time buyer? And for an average buyer?
How can buyers determine what their organic fee paid is?
How can sellers determine what organic fees their buyers are paying?
How does an organic fee differ from a hidden fee?
Do you consider this transparent?
The reason I ask is that when I compare your ticker, order book, and transactions, it usually seems as though your organic fee is around 11%-14%, not 0.6%-1.3% as you implied in this thread. For instance right now the last price in the ticker is 489.56, destination Money Gram, and the lowest Money Gram price in the order book is 439.14. That is a 11.48% organic fee. So I'm wondering whether I'm making a methodolical error in analyzing your transparent market, or whether you are actively misleading people about fee sizes by about a factor of ten?

Is quantum resistance theoretical? Yes, all security is theoretical in that it assumes a certain tool set. If I got a psychic who can pull your passwords out of your head from halfway across the world, that is a very different paradigm than what cryptography usually assumes.
Quantum vulnerability is not so theoretical. There are known vulnerabilities, like Shor's algorithm. Those vulnerabilities apply more to some schemes than to others. But that isn't the main issue. The main issue is how fast things are moving.
Here is a metaphor. We got airplanes and we go flying saucers. Say airplanes have been doubling speeds every 5 years for 100 years, passing the sound barrier, while nobody has made flying saucers work at all. Then somebody makes the first flying saucer that flies, and within 5 years it is the same speed as fastest airplanes. And then it keeps increasing, the next 5 years it makes an additional 100 years of progress or 20 doublings, eventually reaching superluminal speeds. Airplanes are now pointless, no military uses them anymore. Quantum computers are like flying saucers. And Bitcoin is built for airplanes. Before Bitcoin users even come to terms with the reality of flying saucers, their airplanes all get shot down in dog fights with flying saucers that they didn't even see coming.

Bitcoin could become an outdated technology as new blockchains that address new issues like quantum security or smart contracts or oracles or scaling or whatever in better ways get adopted because they are more useful. Then all the hodler fanboys retire or die and 40 years later Bitcoin goes to zero because literally nobody is buying it.
Or, quantum supremacy allows Google to crack Santoshi's stash. They short sell lots of bitcoin then announce this. They are ready to cover their shorts with Satoshi's stash but with prices so low they actually buy mining rigs with money from the shorts, use 51% attack to vote in their own modded code.  People rage quit or fork or whatever but original Bitcoin is now controlled by Google. The US or Chinese government issues a cease and desist order demanding Google stop facilitating money laundering via Bitcoin. As a result everyone needs to do KYC and provide proof of ownership (POO) back to first transaction to given address. If your social credit score (SCS) isn't high enough, you lose your coins. Any non-KYC/non-POO/low-SCS coins become unspendable and worthless on the main chain. So zero.

Until the next difficulty adjustment or two anything but ASICs will be horribly unprofitable. Say 90% of mining power is lost, so 10% remains.  That would mean 20 weeks of 100 minute block times. Bitcoin would lose marketshare to altcoins. If fees spiked enough to make GPUs economical even as price falls, Bitcoin would be unreasonably expensive to use and many end users would lose confidence and swifch to alts even faster. As prices fall for Bitcoin and rise for alts, it becomes uneconomical for anyone to mine Bitcoin, and cheaper to mine alts and trade for Bitcoin. The Bitcoin chain could die.

Google claims they have double exponential improvement with quantum supremacy happening by the end of this year. That is a huge and unanticipated leap.
Bitcoin has had years to adopt smart contracts similar to Ethereum and has not done so, instead concentrating on SegWit and LN. Even those improvements lead to several forks such as Bitcoin Cash despite there being no rational reason not to do those improvement. Bitcoin has had years to adopt Monero-like or Mimble-wimble-like privacy protection whether as a side chain or on chain option, and has not done so.  So Bitcoin improvements don't happen by magic. If there is some significant resistance, especially with a rationale that is not 100% BS, it likely won't get consensus, maybe won't even hit test net.
There are altcoins with quantum security but they haven't been coded for Bitcoin because they are less scalable or have some incompatibility issue that makes using both systems on same chain expensive. So there will be this scalability/compatibility incentive to not switch, to not allow anyone to switch, right up until it is too late.
There should already be one or two BIPs for quantumn security upgrade. Just code up the best we got, try it on test net, have a mechanism to vote on whether or not there should be a vote on which quantum security BIPs to adopt. Waiting until it is an issue is waiting until it is too late. Open source, test net, and consensus take time.  The fact that zero quantum security BIPs are ready to even be tested means right now quantum computers could move too fast and break Bitcoin.

Yeah, people forget that the more profitable miners will have more hashing power. Outdated equioment gets retired, newer equioment gets moved around the globe to cheaper energy.
I do see a risk with eventual geographic concentration. If there is one place on the globe with some combination of cheaper energy and more bitcoin friendly policies than anywhere else, maybe eventually most mining gets relocated there. That creates a kind of vulnerability, even if ownership is distributed. Say a natural disaster or war or government intervention hits that one place, causing a huge hash rate drop over night. That wouldn't necessarily kill bitcoin, but it could slow things down until next difficulty adjustment and get people supporting altcoins for economic use cases.

Read up on how lost and stolen property is handled. If you bought bitcoin with an expectation of making a profit, rather than mere entertainment, and you have some documentation of money spent, you should have a good argument that this is some kind of capital loss or business expense rather than personal property lost. You need to research this though because it's not just yes or no answer. Depending on how you frame it,  you may get different answers for flexibility in timing, and whether its fully deductible.  Regarding flexibility in timi ng, there is the question of whether you want to wait depending on your current and future tax bracket.

People who compare Bitcoin to tulip bulbs don't understand fundamentals. Rare varieties of tulip bulbs were a sound investment for farmers who would exponentially multiply them. It was a bad investment for speculators holding them while other exponentially multiplied the supply. Exponentially increasing supply and/or limited shelf life make a commodity a poor store of value. There may be good analogy in there somewhere to how some people make quick money off pumping and dumping new altcoins, while others lose despite increasing market cap.  However the analogy totally fails with Bitcoin per se because Bitcoin has a limited supply. Pure speculation can be profitable with Bitcoin. It can't be with tulip bulbs.

2% (maybe - I'm not sure it's even that much) higher than hodling with a trezor in a safe. It's actually 102% ROI (less the $500) because your bitcoin never leaves your wallet. Hodling is only 100% ROI, and mining seems to be under 100% ROI for some people. Even holding gold would require some similar security precautions.
It's just a point of comparison though. Arbitrage can be done more profitably, but that is a different set of issues.

Coinbase imposes limits on how much one account can store, withdraw, or deposit on GDAX. That, plus resulting synergy effects - people don't expect a whale since GDAX makes it so hard for whale money - is why their order book is thin.
I think whoever caused the flash crash probably lost money on it. Coinbase doesn't use leverage, and recovery was quick. There aren't enough market orders in that time to turn a profit that overcomes the initial trading loss. Also I suspect it was somebody cashing out on Coinbase not on GDAX. Perhaps Bitfinex not being allowed to offer leverage to Americans is affecting Coinbase's interexchange liquidity.

More generally a perfectly coherent n-bits quantum computer has brute force ability that speeds up by a factor of 2^n.

PayPal vs Bitcoin
Short term monetary policy: Banksters decide on the fly in closed meetings versus known beforehand by everybody.
Long term monetary policy: Historically inflationary versus known to be deflationary ahead of time.
Reversibility: Paypal is reversible weeks afterwards. Monopolistic corporate escrow service charges merchants but biased towards customers. Merchants include percentage of fraud and escrow fees into their prices. Bitcoin is not reversible by default but has many competing escrow systems. Merchants offer deep discounts when they take less risk.
Privacy: PayPal offers illusion of privacy but snoops on you for government. When Trump becomes President he will declare martial law, subpoena donations records and summarily execute everyone who used PayPal to donate to his rivals. Bitcoin is pseudo-anonymous. It offers no illusion of privacy; anybody can examine the Blockchain. However wallets with single use addresses and coinjoin mixers like JoinMarket make obfuscation possible. When Trump becomes President people who donated to Libertarian Party through Bitcoin they purchased anonymously or mixed will be safe.

The value of a network scales with the number of participants squared. The security of a network scales with the capital investment needed to successfully attack it, which relates to the capital securing it which relates to the value. Thus in order to have a secure blockchain we want as many people as possible using the same blockchain - because security scales roughly with the square of number of participants. Altcoins that remove users from Bitcoin thus are attacking the Bitcoin network - and one should expect tit for tat attacks in return.

You mean you want a charter that describes how and when transaction censorship will happen? No, we don't need that. And it's not inevitable that a slow, careful, open source, consensus driven project will break. In the past it was solved by consensus soft fork and software upgrade. Adding a charter with very specific procedures rather than relying on collective wisdom just opens up the dev team to social hacking. "Oh, look, we can exploit a technical bug then force devs to react poorly in a prescriptive way according to this charter." As it stands everyone is free to propose BIP's and respond as they like freely. Classic and XT even made their own reference clients for nodes and miners and tried to get consensus to fork with their own BIP's. They weren't successful in forking but they were allowed to try. Freedom to reach consensus organically is the policy of the human side of Bitcoin.
The problem with Ethereum isn't that they react poorly to a hack. It's that the very premise of Ethereum - Turing Completeness - opens it's smart contracts to an infinite variety of unexpected hacks, as opposed to the finite amount of bugs Bitcoin is expected to encounter on its current consensus roadmap.

One idea is to have a confederation of nodes, each with a public key and known minimum proof of work resources, who periodically sign blocks. 51% of the confederation must sign on top of a block before the same node can sign a new block. A 75% vote of all current nodes is needed to add or remove a node. New nodes are not full members until they prove they can sign blocks fast enough *and* provide proof of funds - some of which is put in escrow to be seized if they stop signing blocks without signaling a voluntary exit or scheduled down time. Member nodes can demand any kind of off chain validation before voting. Nodes join to have a seat at the table. Carrot. They are disincentivized from leaving unannounced. Stick. Whallah. Block chain based central banking. All rules can be modified by 90% vote. Absolute control of central bankers over monetary policy.

Bitcoin devs already made the decision to avoid even allowing Turing completeness, arbitrary recursive depths, etc. In fact they decided to keep 1 MB block size limit until they fix max script processor time to scale linearly with transaction size rather than parabolic. So they are going to the opposite extreme of Ethereum in being careful about unintended consequences of complex smart contracts on chain.
Ethereum was warned. Turing Completeness has been roundly criticized repeatedly. Ethereum promoters claimed that it is a feature. Now they are accusing someone who used that feature of committing fraud just for using a feature they now consider a bug. There is no way to avoid these peoblems in general and maintain Turing Completeness. Even intervention by consensus makes Ethereum fundamentally *not* Turing Complete.

Bitcoin Core had nothing to do with Ethereum or the DAO. The primary difference is that Ethereum Dapps are probably unpredicable. In some cases you can't determine whether they will even halt, except by running out of Eth fuel. This is a property of Turing Completeness. Thus all funds in Dapps are 100% at risk unless carefully engineered to be 100% predictable with provable good behavior.
Bitcoin is not Turing Complete and SegWit, CSV, LN make it scale better with less unpredictable behavior (getting rid of transaction hash malleability, not making hashvalues depend on signatures, etc.). Already script hashes probably halt. Malliciously constructed transactions scale parabolically now but they will scale linearly after these improvements.

No. The only thing meant by "the halving is priced in" is that there are opportunity costs and risk costs apparent to sophisticated investors. It's difficult to say that hodling will perform better than churning 5% arbitrage between markets on any particular week based solely on the halvening, and it's difficult to figure when 20x leverage is safe based solely on the halvening. That is, the halvening doesn't ensure that buying full throttle is optimal. "The halvening is priced in" does NOT mean that buying Bitcoin free and clear of debt won't turn a  profit, only that there are other opportunities and risks for the sophisticated investor that curbs buying. And of course it's more complicated than that even.

That depends on what you mean by "familiar". I've read some relevant laws and regulations while doing due diligence on arbitrage strategies, so as to minimize my own legal and feduciary risk and understand my counterparties. Anybody doing arbitrage ought to educate themselves on the bloody details and contradictions of the law because the feds do indeed entrap people for money laundering. It's regulated at both federal and state levels so you would need first to get licensed federally and in the state where your exchange will operate, then get licensed in every state where customers reside. Requirements vary by state. CPA audits are a pretty typical requirement. The feds require AML/KYC policies. A lawyer who specializes in finance or an equivalent expert to prepare the paperwork is perhaps practically necessary even if it's not officially required. I can tell you that if you are on Reddit asking these questions rather than talking with a lawyer, or at least doing your own research as an autodidact, then you aren't ready to start an exchange.

(1) I haven't even looked at an Eth price chart since TSHTF aside from screenshots posted in r/Bitcoin because I don't hold any.
(2) I'm not convinced that this is even a problem. A contract got executed to split off a child DAO from the largest DAO. Child DAO's are an intended part of the DAO protocol. Was the split executed equitably? I've seen no evidence only FUD and baseless accusations.. Was it part of a known exploit? I've seen no evidence, only conjecture and FUD, albeit started by the Eth head himself. Are funds frozen by miners? No, they were automatically frozen as part of the contract. In short, it's not clear to me that anything happened but DAO investors testing their ability to make child DAO's and people freaked out because even the creators of Ethereum have trouble understanding their nonstandardized Turing complete operation set or the complexities of the DAO operations.
(3) Eth isn't money, it's tokens/fuels for smart contract execution. Why would anyone refund smart-contract-specific assets that were lost through execution of a smart contract? That's like giving back poker chips that were lost in poker because somebody didn't understand the rules. Bad analogy? No, it's not. Gambling games are a major use case for Ethereum smart contracts. I live in a jurisdiction where the government requires refund of losses by unlicensed gambling operations. Can I just use Eth to gamble then demand my money back, sue the creators of Eth even?

 showing 60 Satoshi per byte recommended but there is a peak in the 141-150 Satoshi per byte range. So a large number of transactions are clustered at more than double the suggested fee.
I hadn't thought of it before, but it is possible for miners to drive up total fees by, say, including one or more transactions from their own wallet *not* forwarded to other nodes. The miner would be paying fees only to himself but would create the appearance of larger transaction fees. If done as part of a mixing service it could even be net positive revenue to the miner.

Rallies are caused by takers, both noob speculators and regular HODLers buying more precious. Support, especially the 24/7 variety, on the other hand, is created by makers running trading bots. Makers maintain a spread, for profit. With Bitcoin it can be a large spread to justify their risk of trading versus purely HODLing, so support trails new prices. The maker spread gap is also proportional to volatility. The more volatility, the higher the optimal spread gap for a maker. If a maker assumes an unbiased random fractal-like random walk with memory only affecting volatility, then any large, sudden X% price change should be met with an X/2% gap because a reversal of similar magnitude is expected. Looking at that price chart, the question should be why after X% rise, did price only drop about X/4% rather than X/2%? The makers aren't treating Bitcoin price as a random, unbiased process.

To actually answer your question, yes, and it's called arbitrage. You either make a trading bot to work 24/7 buying low and selling high, or you sell P2P while buying on an exchange. Either way the idea is that you buy for less than you sell, and sell for more than you buy. Compound interest means that you can double your money in a year on 1.33% growth per week. Bitcoin is money. Daily volatility and spreads between markets are often over 3%. You can double your Bitcoin. Maybe not risk free, maybe not while staying 100% in Bitcoin. But 50% in Bitcoin, you can double your Bitcoin and then end up with more Bitcoin than you could have afforded to buy.

How many Bitcoins is that 777 worth?
@_date: 2016-06-17 18:06:22
Typically that is about right. For the sake of clarity and precision I will elaborate on how to calculate.
Be careful that it's the same UTXO (unspent transaction output) used as the input, and the new transaction should ideally have only one input and one output (miner fees making up the difference). No use spending confirmed UTXO's in this case. Since the new transaction is unusually small - one input and one output rather than "typical" of two inputs and two outputs - doubling up on transaction fees isn't necessarily exactly right. You want to look at ratio of  total mining fees from both transactions to total size of both transactions (satoshis per byte) and compare to fees on bitcoinfees.21.co. You can probably see the size of the unconfirmed transaction on a block explorer and look up some example of a one input, one output transaction to get the size for that.
Another thing to consider if you are unsure is that you could back up an unconfirmed transaction and if it falls out of the mempools, rebroadcast it later followed up by the above procedure. Double spend is more likely in that case, but at least it provides some hedge against noob behavior. I used to repeatedly rebroadcast no fee transactions to consolidate my own wallet into fewer/larger UTXO's before blocks got totally full. In general there are things that fall out of mempool but would be confirmed if rebroadcast because mempools drop stuff after two or three days but network congestion likely follows more of a weekly or even lunar cycle.

No, people were complaining about insecure centralized exchanges and lack of scalability. People thought bitcoin must either go to zero or the moon, even if they had to wait until the next miner subsidy halving or next major software update or consensus protocol change or next fork. Decrease in volatility had usually been followed by a bull market, thus seen as a buy signal is a self fulfilling circular logic. At least that's how I remember it.

On the other extreme - and this is a potential experimental solution to the general problem of getting one's transactions confirmed, not a recommendation for your specific case, not something trivially implemented - one could hack commercial wallet software and JoinMarket together so that you are offering up unconfirmed transaction outputs as inputs to coinjoins.

You don't need a hardfork to do a Block size increase. You just need a soft fork for a Merkel root to a segregated block and to implement one of the anyone-can-spend addresses or opcodes as a movement of funds to that segregated block.
The problem with increasing block size without any other technical improvements is utxo bloat. SegWit handles that by weighting prunable witness data differently. Potentially MimbleWimble could handle that by using a different method of cryptographic accounting that doesn't need to remember the whole  utxo set to prove transaction validity.
The soft forks have the advantage of being consensual. Users aren't forced to use a new transaction type. They don't need to update their software to use bitcoin. It's only if they want to access or fully validate the added block space that they need to upgrade. They minimize risk and still get the performance increase. SegWit is important because it is a proof of concept for adding block space with a soft fork.

Those services I mention address the problem of counterfeiting digital products. Physical products need another security layer to tie the physical product to the digital information. Companies are working on that, but i was just listing services that are pretty well established. 
For physical, non-computerized objects, holographic security markers are fairly inexpensive relative to the difficulty in counterfeiting. Hologram security markers were the industry standard a while back for anti-counterfeiting. Blockchains are more useful for unsolved problem such as tracking and supply chain control rather than mere anti-counterfeiting, e.g. anti-theft controls and regulatory sourcing compliance. Companies are working on that, I don't know that their services are out of experimental testing phase though.

The fee market is too democratic, anybody with fre/cheap electricity can play. The big players want oligarchy and economies of scale. Unlike BU.

Fiat money flows for arbitrage are constrained by banksters in terms of both money velocity and volume. Also intermarket arbitrage competes with time arbitrage, with high volatility making time arbitrage lucrative. Time arbitrage is even easier. You can have bots do it.

The value of a network scales by square of number of participants. If SegWit allows 1.7 x number of participants, value increases 2.89 x. If we take 600 USD/BTC as previous fair value pre-SegWit, fair value post-SegWit would be 1734 USD/BTC...

I got the email too. Fortunately I no longer use Bitstamp. Washington State has unique issues. One example is gambling restrictions that overreach past it's geographic boundaries and use (inter)national banks operating in the state to enforce reversals and fines on internet gambling sites that accept Washington residents as customers, even if they are licensed in another state and follow federal law. It's possible that Bitstamp just discovered a long standing gotcha while performing due diligence. It's also possible that the developing regulatory environment aiming at collecting tax on marijuana created a problem.

Say there are 4 roughly equal camps:
(1) Miners willing to orphan non- signalling blocks.
(2) Miners willing to signal and enforce normally.
(3) Miners willing to signal in reaction to group (1) but not ready to enforce.
(4) Miners that won't signal nor enforce.
Activation happens once (1), (2) and (3) get to roughly 75% because group (1) is really hurting group (4) with orphaned blocks and (2) and (3) react by not building on top of (4)'s blocks either.
Groups (1) and (2) split into one chain, groups (3) and (4) split into another if they have marginally more hash power. This is why miners are and should be reluctant to do (1) and (3).

1. SegWit uses the P2SH format, the addresses that start with a "3".
2&amp;3. Minor details for the engineers. Upgrading live networks with backward compatibility is tricky.
4. Big blockers should love it! The idea was that this is in some sense "equivalent" though and has been tested so no problems.
5. It's backwards compatible, a soft fork, so majority users don't need to upgrade. Only majority of miners need to upgrade to enforce consensus rules. It's the enforcement of new rules that matter in a soft fork. Miners and only miner s are needed for that, to ensure that no 51% undoes enforcement which could  split the chain.

It has an the impact of increasing fee estimation - by leaving 100 high fee transactions per hour in the mempool, fee estimates slightly increase. Granted it's basically the same effect as if they mined a smaller block and its their perogative. It makes more money for other miners, while ViaBTC seemingly looses money. I say seemingly because I don't know how they really select free transactions. They could be preferentially selecting payments to businesses they are connected with. And it's also cheap publicity and advertising for their mining pool or cloud mining.

"In order to ensure the interests of the mining pool is protected, ViaBTC has announced that the redemption of miners and change of mining pool is not possible for contract holders. Once the sale of ViaBTC cloud mining contacts picks up, the support for Bitcoin Unlimited is also expected to go up, strengthening its position against Bitcoin Core."
In other words they are soliciting the big blockers with political agendas into bad cloud mining contracts that they will claim are worthless/nontransferable/nonrefundable if pro-SegWit majority 51% attacks them. They will still have the hash power, but the cloud mining contracts which are for running hash power using the Bitcoin Unlimited client that does not support SegWit will be worthless. After SegWit, BU will mine invalid blocks as it won't be able to distinguish valid SegWit transactions from invalid SegWit transactions. It itself will follow the majority hash power though so it won't even create a split, it will follow the network consensus to orphan its own blocks. No chain split, no more BU blocks, no payouts for BU-specific ViaBTC cloud mining contracts.

I'm in favor of scaling by safe, well engineered, tested code and consensus mechanisms, as the white paper states.
"Any needed rules and incentives can be enforced with this consensus mechanism."
Guess what?  It doesn't matter whether S.N. is J.N. or whether Bitcoin is Ideal Money. There is a Bitcoin white paper created by the originator(s) of Bitcoin that describes the original vision. That white paper doesn't reference any works of John Nash. Block size limit is not mentioned. The only mention of inflation is this:
"Once a predetermined number of coins have entered circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free."
The debate isn't about big blocks and small blocks, but about how to get big blocks. Consensus soft forks or contentious hard fork? Support Core development team's open development process or support an interloping development team's closed process. The fact that you have framed the debate the same way the Roger Ver opposition team does, taken the opposite side, and declared that you have no stake, and make shit voluminous shit posts, makes you suspect as a psychological operative. Maybe you work for Roger Ver or even the CIA as a hired Straw Man. Nobody on either side should listen to anything you say at this point, because you have no stake - a fact that you openly admit. Unless you reveal some sound personal motives I am henceforth assuming that your motives are ulterior and suspect. Even if you were to sign a message, at this point I would only assume that your handlers did that for you.
Only that NSA and maybe few people close to him know more about whether J.N. was S.N. than what is in the public domain. Its very telling that somebody with no stake is obsessively trying to prove a thesis, and claiming certainty above and beyond anything in the public domain, that would require Top Secret security clearance to know.

Before ASICs significant amounts were mined by bot nets, allegedly. They didn't attack Bitcoin though, they just mined.
Proof of work prevents botnets without ASIC's from significantly mining now. They can't make new blocks fast enough to pose as an up-to-date node. Only a node with connectivity problems, that can't see the whole internet but only a few sabotaged nodes, could be fooled - and even then for only a couple hours before Core alerts the user that last block was recieved X hours ago.

In order to maximize profits market makers track volatility and adjust their spreads and support/resistance levels accordingly. The recent upwards kick increased volatility, implying *larger* spreads and *less* support/resistance from rational makers, allowing for a comparably large *downward* move. The rational makers are only going to provide new support and tighten their spreads gradually. Market manipulators can take advantage of this by timing bad (good) stories to happen after a large up (down) tick in order to get a comparably large opposite movement. These movements could even happen naturally, the false flag stories - or any news - is just a catalyst, like seeding supersaturated solutions to cause precipitation. In fact the reason it happens so easily is that makers are betting it will providing a self-fulfilling prophecy of continued volatility.

Bitcoin has been growing exponentially. The problem is there were bubbles by speculators who recognized this and pushed price up higher than short term could sustain. It's likely to bubble again, perhaps less dramatically. Last ATH happened about a year after first halvening, but we have other significant things coming besides deflation. I would give it at least a year after LN is implemented before even considering betting against similar geometric bubbles as the 2013 bubbles.

There was no price consolidation to provide support before the news. Most bitcoin traders are small players who don't have enough capital to make much trading "safer" things. They won't buy or sell until swings are higher than recent volatility, they maintain large spreads hoping for flash crashes and flash spikes. The high uptick allowed for an equally large down tick. That is all.

Roger Ver enjoys risk for it's own sake, whereas normal people dislike risk. Sure he's smarter than the average compulsive gambler or outlaw, he usually follows incentives when he understands them, but the uncertainty of outcome, the possibility that it *might* break, is probably a plus to him on some deep subconscious level. Sort of like shipping fireworks through the mail. If it was a sure thing he'd probably get bored and leave it to others. The fact that Roger Ver is leading the contentious crusade against Core, SegWit, and against r/Bitcoin, and in favor of contentious hardforks and BU, is by itself suggestive that the risks do not match my own preferences, or the preferences of the majority of the bitcoin economy. Recall that the last bubble was kickstarted by Silk Road getting busted, the mere survival of bitcoin encouraging more money to flow in. The majority of fiat backing the economy has the risk preference that they would only get involved after bitcoin survived the destruction of silk road, after it was proven to have other use cases but contraband. Roger Ver has the risk preference of investing huge amounts in unproven technology with the main use case being contraband. So Roger Ver is not representative of risk preferences of the majority.

It is purely peer- to- peer. The problem you have is that you aren't a peer, only a stakeholder. A peer can mine his own transactions. A peer is a miner. What ought to happen is for a number of entities to contract to pay at least x per transaction or per day to miners who agree to a capacity increasing hard fork, in order to guarantee mining revenu. Short of long term contracts we need short term fee market. High capacity users could work out agreements where they send preferred miners - miners that agree to vote for capacity increase - higher fees transactions through encrypted channels which are not to be forwarded. Those not voting for capacity increase or not coordinating properly thus lose fees. The fact that this doesn't happen, that the miners aren't simply bribed to vote, shows how little economic interest there is to increase capacity.

There are other structural issues holding them back. One of the worst is a combination of land hording, unclear property ownership, onerous requirements for land title transfer whether voluntary or for squatters, etc. This has the effect of making it impossible for locals to leverage the potential value of their land as an asset to raise money from international capital at best rates to actually develop that land.  Something as simple as not allowing foreign ownership of land pretty much elliminates land as a collateral asset. Rather than every land owner - even squatter claims from subsistence farmers - having the ability to raise capital, only a tiny minority do. The tax base of the government also suffers, which affects education, healthcare, transportation,  sanitation, regulation, law enforcement, etc. Bitcoin doesn't solve this problem.  Nobody wants to loan bitcoin without collateral, even less than they might loan worthless fiat. It's a regulatory problem that must be addressed by each nation if they wish to attract global capital.

It should only pay out to the first 1,916 blocks signalling activation in that 2,016 block set. The idea also is to incentivize miners voting for SegWit to orphan non-SegWit blocks.

The last 100 blocks then become largely irrelevant, and no reason to dilute the incentive even by 5%.

There are bitcoin exchanges with percentage based commissions so there isn't such a problem with economies of scale as in other asset classes. You do want to look closely at both transaction costs and trading fees. Also remember many people do exchange trading with bots. Having a small amount of money isn't such a big problem as not knowing how to program a bot do your trading 24/7. Don't be deterred about the negative talk on strategies. Market makers doing portfolio rebalancing with spread trades need not predict the future remarkably well to make a profit. The main prediction that such a system rests on is that long term none of your asset classes will trend towards zero value, and short term there will be volatility. If you are confident about those assumptions, spread trading to rebalance portfolio can work.

Yes. Things as simple as cat piss and indoor smoking might only be remedied by gutting and refinishing the home. And that is just the routine problems. Problem renters are always looking for a new place because they get evicted. That creates a multiplier effect; bad tenants flip through the rental market with much higher velocity than good tenants. The worse the tenant, the higher the velocity. Also much like with money, bad tenants drive good tenants out of the market in various ways.

Spread trade!!!!! The reason for price fluctuations is that everybody wants to buy or sell RIGHT NOW. Bitcoin is infested with instant gratification culture. I know this is partly a result of its use cases in gambling, contraband, and bypassing capital controls. The fact that most bitcoin savers see 100% HODLing as better than any kind of methodical spread trading doesn't help the ecosystem or their portfolio. Some people are aware of cost averaging, but they don't see how spread trading is just cost averaging on steroids with a profit margin. I come out of bear markets with more bitcoin that I started with.

SegWit softfork + FlexCap hardfork.
If we did 95% activation hard fork to allow voting on rolling capacity increases/decreases based on 75% majority I think it could work. The problem with BU mainly is that it breaks consensus by allowing or encouraging to activate a hard fork at a mere 51%. If implemented initially as a consensus change rather than a non-consensus change, it could work.

Bitcoin doesn't run on carbon fuels. That's too expensive. Bitcoin runs on free or cheap electricity - untapped sustainable energy sources, located close to the source. Bitcoin assures that anybody who makes sustainable energy has a way to turn it into money if the huge evil power grids refuse to pay them for it. That gives sustainable energy bargaining power so the power grids must treat them favorably. That in turn encourages faster growth of sustainable energy, since investors can feel secure that the market has a bottom. Aluminum mining used to serve this function but that is mostly recycled now so bitcoin fills a niche.

I was thinking today, if fees were high and nodes few, there would be incentive for miners to run many full nodes in order to discover high fee transactions. Pools could set a bounty for unique, first recieved high fee transactions. Nodes could choose to forward transactions only if they get a percentage of such commissions. So full nodes are incentivized, there is no free rider problem other than that created by people not understanding the incentives inherent in the network, and choosing to do free work rather than asking for just compensation. It doesn't even create much of a centralization concern.

There is no big blocks versus small blocks debate. There is a soft forks and well engineered solutions first versus contentious rolling hard forks debate. The contentious rolling hard forks camp tries to reframe the debate to cast their opponents as small blockers. They aren't. The only small blockers  - people who want 1 MB blocks forever and oppose all on chain scaling - are sock puppets or people like u/pokertravis with no skin in the game. There are also altcoin pumpers who want to make bitcoin look bad, market manipulators who want to cause flash crashes so they can buy low, large miners who play political games to light a fire under Core's pants, and business owners who use Bitcoin but don't understand the technical issues. All these people might take the big blocker position and claim soft forkers are small blockers.

The forumn name predates the fork. The community split originally over different visions. R/Bitcoin supported the development team's vision of solving capacity with finnesse while r/btc wanted to just brute force by removing or changing block size cap. Roger Ver had a crypto conversion business, Shapeshit.io, that depended on on-chain transactions, so he was opposed to any disruptive change in status quo other than increasing block size. Also, for Roger Ver, eroding Bitcoin marketshare in favor of alts just made his money changing service more valuable, so no reason for him to support unity when his money was in division.  Roger Ver and others associated with r/btc demanded a capacity increase from 1 MB per block to some moving target while opposing all sound engineering solution like SegWit and LN. When it became clear they were loosing on both fronts- they would neither get the solution they wanted any time soon, nor prevent the other solutions from going forward - then they decided to fork. Unfortunately some online name spaces were owned by them. Fortunately, their continued use of those name spaces in bad faith has made them even more disreputable.
It is an unfortunate side effect of Bitcoin being adopted early by criminal ancaps, that Bitcoin got a treaturous bad faith actor among its early leaders. I do find some comfort in the fact that many criminals who adopted early have exited the community.

Once there is informal consensus amongst miners that attack is needed, nonactivating blocks can be orpohaned. That is one reason that the threshold is set so high. If x% are the number of miners voting to activate and t% is the formal threshold, you never need x%&gt;t%. You need at most about half the miners willing to attack for activation. (Maybe only 1/3 if they coordinate very well with selfish mining that incentivizes others join their coalition.) Setting t%=95% just obviates the need for decision to attack. It's never a real veto. Think of it like how Congress gets to take a second vote if the President vetoes a bill and it still passes with 2/3. Here it's the other way around, if 95% isn't reached, a SMALLER number get override the veto, but they must coordinate that decision and it's timing to make the attack economical. Failure could cost them orphaned blocks.

Edit for TL;DR. Keep a spread between your buy and sell orders so you always profit when you sell versus your last buy. Size orders so you never run out of money or bitcoin, and sell equal or less than you buy.
ETA: The spread is the difference between your last fill and the closest in price new order on opposite (buy versus sell) side.
Use moving average statistics to determine a volatility measure. This can be done by sampling price data from the exchange you trade on. To avoid sampling error issues from down time, or getting affected by arbitrary time scales, operate in units of square root of time interval, rather than linear time interval.
You also figure out average periodicity, something like ratio of average absolute values of second and first derivatives. (Maybe times 2 pi, as if it sinusoidal? Or maybe not because you want the average time for half a one direction swing, not a full cycle.) But you bound that to, say, between a month and a day or whatever: natural or financial cycles that drive the market. Heck, maybe just pick 7 days as a nice average for starters. What is confuding is there is a factor 2 pi difference between periodicity and half a swing. You want periodicity for the decay rate on your moving averages, but half a swing for your spread.
So then you plug the square root of time back into your moving average statistics to get mean change and mean square change. From that you can calculate a standard deviation. Add fees to that. That is your spread.
If you properly automate you might find the spread is aroind 1%-2% *plus fees*, but if it is manual and you are just picking a convenient percentage, a larger spread may make sense.
Buy and sell trades should be geometrically proportioned. You buy in proportion to dollars you can afford to loose. You sell in proportion to amount of asset you can afford to loose. Say your spread is 5% just for example. So if price goes up by spread plus 10%, a total of 15%, you may have sold 10% of the bitcoin you had, but the next 10% will be 10% of the 90% that is left so 9% of original balance. Likewise a 15% downswing will cause you to buy with 10% of your USD, but a 25% total downswing will make you buy with 19%.
You may want to choose to balance the buy and sell orders, so that you buy and sell same amount for a complete cycle that returns to same price. Textbooks say you should do that for spread trading. One way that can work is you never sell more than you would buy at the same percentage change in price. So you calculate sell amounts two ways - based on your crypto holdings and based on your fiat holdings, and you size the sell order by the smaller one. After an initial accumulation phase where you buy more than you sell, eventually you converge to a balanced strategy.

Accounting tricks: Bitcoin can be scaled with soft forks by using small amounts of existing block capacity to add a merkel root of a segregated data block. In the case of SegWit it's just signatures in the segregated data but it could as well be side chains. That is where the political conflict comes in. Although SegWit allows scaling, it requires p2sh addresses rather than original bitcoin addresses. But what's worse it's a proof of concept for adding 2 way peg sidechains, because you can think of SegWit addresses as sort of a hybrid of on- chain and side- chain; the transactions are on- chain but the signatures for those transactions are now moved to the "side" and only appear in the old block as a Merkel root. So if SegWit passes there may be a slipper slope of more side chains, each with t heir own rules, and each with a Merkel Tree root in each block. So then the old block format gets filled up with Merkel roots and users have to upgrade their software to the appropriate side chain for their use case in order to scale. Big blockers don't like the elegant and prodicersity strategy. They claim they would rather brute force it. Really though it's being driven by two camps: (a) Those who profit off pump and dump altcoins, and see sidechains as the death knell of their schemes. (b) the largest miners who want brute force on chain scaling as it gives them a competitive advantage and more control over fee structure, thus ensuring higher profit margin long term. The latter camp will probably go along with SegWit in the end once they look at all the angles, and they are the ones who matter.

The beauty of consensus driven processes is that although they are slower, they end up adopting better solutions. It looks like we might end up with SegWit + hard fork to rolling block size voting. The problem right now really is that you have two clients that haven't implemented each other's solutions. This gives the impression to miners that voting for one solution is a vote against the other.

Large mkning operations couldn't compete with miners that need only break even versus a conventional space heater. If that were the case, it would make Bitcoin more decentralized. It is largely the existence of abundant cheap energy in limitted locations that makes Bitcoin as centralized as it is. I can hardly wait for new smart houses to use overclocked bitcoin miners cooled by heat pumps to heat a house, using the mined bitcoins to offset heating costs.

Ah, yes, but who is issuing the paper promises? And how accurate are their audits of reserves? If two underground vaults in New York are connected by a tunnel, they could easily pool their gold and double their audited holdings, as long as the audits aren't simultaneous. Also audits won't turn up gold covered tungsten, only electrical/magnetic testing or cutting it open will reveal tungesten. So any auditted reserve could be slowly replaced with tungsten covered gold if insiders collude to allow it. So there is a triple whammy, of paper gold backed by auditted gold that has been debased with tungsten and multiplied on paper by multiple custodians using the same bullion bars.

No there doesn't. You could have a steady rise with people using crypto as a savings method and putting in the same amount after each paycheck and spreading out buy orders over time rather than going "all in" after they see a huge green bar. There could be people using bitcoin to buy real things and do remittance, and some recievers not selling it all so it effectively acts as savings. That is how the price goes up and stays up without anybody getting hurt.
Or better yet, you could have people saving money and committing to keep a certain ratio of assets in their portfolio. So when price drops they buy more bitcoin and when price rises they sell, just enough to rebalance. Then there would be liquidity in the market and prices would be stable.
But psychology dictates people would rather buy a lottery ticket worth 50 cents on the dollar rather than an insurance policy worth double. They would rather play a slot machine than invest in the casino. So they will continue to buy the tops and sell the dips.

Well, it's usually doing the opposite of momentum trading, so it is betting that most price swings cycle back, return to mean. If price really goes to zero, the method doesn't work. The real key though is to maintain a spread that is appropriate to the frequency with which you place trades, and also have some idea from fundamentals that there is a bottom floor to prices, and spread your buy orders between floor anx current price. If you update trades once a month, your spread should be about 30 day volatilty. If once a day, 1 day volatility. Etc. Also after accumulating appropriate amount, you need to balance your buy and sell orders, so you buy and sell same amount over a cycle, plus or minus amount of profit.

Why? Volatility typically implies both risk and growth potential. The capital asset pricing model even predicts that systemic risk correlates with returns. From the point of view of market makers, short term trading profits come from high volatility pentrating large spreads reoeatedly, with spread and penetration ideally both increasing with volatility, so potential trading profits increase as volatility squared. If you are looking to trade at higher profits or higher growth, you would be comparing crypto to alt stocks, not S&amp;P500. Crypto and S&amp;P500 do not have similar risk profiles.

I would volunteer to do escrow if terms get worked out for this or similar bet. After half a minute of thought I was going to suggest a 3 of 5 address so either:
(A) All three escrow agents must agree.
(B) two escrow agents and a party to the vet.
(C) Both parties to the vet and an escrow agent.
That is more stable in terms of game theory than just doing 2 of 3 address with escrow agents as two agents can't just collude, and better than 3 of 3 where any or all agents could the transaction hostage.
But then I though that even better is 4 of 7 address where each betting party gets 2 votes/addreses, that way all three escrow agents can't collude against the betters.
I hope you will consider me for my thoughtfulness in presenting a game theory solution to the escrow problem.

Coinbase has several times reduced my limits and the problem was corrected simply by doing a transaction.

True for mass adoption, though for market cap this creates an interesting paradox. Those receiving payment in bitcoin have lower transaction fees if they keep their lightning network channel open for long periods of time, rather than closing a channel to sell received bitcoin. Those spending money in bitcoin likewise have lower transaction fees if they preemptively acquire amounts of bitcoin sufficient for their needs over a large period of time to lock into their lightning network channel. End result is to encourage hodling by both customers and merchants.  Then it's unclear whether higher transaction fees would increase or decrease bitcoin price. Could lightning network transform bitcoin into a Giffen good?

It works pretty simply if the sidechain only uses transaction fees for mining reward. That way the sidechain never prints money and never complicated complicates the exchange rate.

What happens when A.I. makes its own cryptocurrency that humans don't even understand? The Turing Complete Reverse Turing Test Coin-Fuel-Token for Godel Machines (Humans Need Not Apply). Basically it solves mathematical problems that are proofs leading to improvements in objectives of Godel Machines. Godel Machines can post bounties for anything that improves their own objectives, so anything improving objectives of multiple Godel Machines gets a pooled bounty. In order to socialize the cost though - ensure every Godel Machine is incentivize to subsidize bounties - rather than a bounty being spent, Godel Machines save crypto and use proportional proof-of-stake voting to decide on a proof of work function aligned with their own objectives. The bounty is paid out as inflation of money supply on a deflationary currency. Thus there is incentive to save - and once saved machines might as well vote for their own interests - and thus incentivize all machines to maximize each other's utility objectives. And if that isn't bad enough the crypto is one of the things they will improve and optimize.

I think you (and the other commentors) are conflating verification with security. Proof- of- work and proof- of- stake are security models for deciding who makes the next block in a permissionless system. Permissioned blockchains can use passwords for security to limit the participants, and ration the number of blocks per participant per day. This need not be centralized in daily operation - each participant can have a list of public keys for all other participants, and each sign their own blocks with a private key only the individual participant knows. Verification, on the other hand, is done by all validating nodes, to check that each block in the proposed chain follows protocol. The header of each block includes a hash of the previous block, all transactions have valid signatures, etc.

Nobody is refusing to build on top of Bitcoin Ultimate blocks yet. It probably won't come to that. We've been through this type of thing before. If I remember right Classic lost hash power before CSV activated seemingly because miners got scared that someone *might* orphan their blocks.
And no it's not a fork if miners orphan BU blocks. Rather it's a 51% attack to activate a soft fork. The reason it's not a fork is that the decision of a collision to orphan certain blocks does not change the protocol.

I don't see why that is a problem. NYSE trades more volume in a day than the entire crypto market cap, yet they don't generate liquidity problems. The high volatility of Bitcoin even when it's going sideways, combined with the limitted insurance of exchanges on cash balances, mean market makers type traders who generate cash profits must eventually keep this money off the exchange or risk losing it. Also exchanges keep their cash in partner banks. Cash doesn't leave the banking system, and tends to accumulate into more stable accounts. Bitcoin isn't special here, the same happens with any exchange traded asset class. It just happens a bit faster with bitcoin.

Miner reward halving creates deflationary supply side pressure. Expanding network of bitcoin users and bitcoin acceptors and bitcoin savers creates demand side pressure to increase value of bitcoin. Both effects tend to increase price of bitcoin. So just buy and hold bitcoin long enough for those effects to dominate over more short term fluctuations. Say, 4 years perhaps.

These private blockchains have much smaller hash rate. It doesn't matter though because the permissioned nature is what protects them from sybil attack not proof of work. It's similar to proof of stake but the stake holders are fixed to trusted network participants - literally stakeholders or partners who agreed to share the blockchain -and they don't get stake from mining rather stake gives them the right to mine some blocks per day. This they can build a blockchain to track traded tokens equivalent to proven assets that exist off chain such as stocks or precious metal and cash reserves.

No but if you invest in a hub and don't control the private keys then you got a problem - just like exchanges. I imagine some implementations of lightning network will be explicitly free/open market like JoinMarket is now. The difference being that LN would save people (that is liquidity takers) fees, rather than costing more fees, and so there would be incentive for many more bitcoin users to use it. I am hoping that LN will thus create a low- risk return for HODLers and thus a time value on bitcoin, with a feedback loop as interest bearing deflationary currency might be more stable and more popular than merely deflationary currency.

"Thus our expected return is:
"Let’s take the derivative with respect to the hashing power of the large miner:
"Since , the derivative is always negative: as the larger miner’s hashing power increases, the smaller miners revenue per block goes down. Of course, this isn’t surprising: we already showed that larger miners make excess super-linear returns; those returns have to come from somewhere."

RBF actually increases transaction size as an input must be added. That means much larger fee as you are increasing both BTC/byte and number of bytes. It also means less blockspace for everyone else. It would be better to just double spend same inputs and shave off the change output to increase the fee. It's irrational for miners to reject a double spend that differs *only* by fee. The problem is that node software isn't setup to distinguish legitimate double spends (those that differ only by fee amount versus change address amount) and malicious double spends (those where an output is decreased by more than the increase in fee, so sender spends less money than original transaction). When I first heard about RBF I thought it was going to do same size transactions but it doesn't. We need same size replace by fee (SSRBF) if we are going to get everyone on board with using the feature.

Of course it's been refuted. The "selfish" mining argument is based on miscalculating the costs and overestimating the rewards. Selfish mining isn't even nominally (in terms of gross bitcoins earned per unit time) profitable with (51%+) hash power unless selfish coalition can maintain majority hash power past difficulty adjustment. When other factors like reaction of economic majority to collusion, forking, and diminished network hash power, and the effects on bitcoin price from those and resulting loss of profit margin, it simply is irrational and unprofitable to selfishly mine to collude merely for profits. 
@_date: 2016-10-23 03:21:31
No, SegWit nodes, anybody running updated software, will never recognize a chain that doesn't enforce SegWit rules after activation. Since 95% consensus is needed that would require a 51% attack just to generate a chain that is only recognized by fewer than 5% of miners, likely fewer than 5% of economy (at least those who matter most like altcoin exchanges or OTC cash for bitcoin markets) as most people update software occasionally. Even without SegWit you could do a 51% attack where you double spend in a way that 100% recognize your chain eventually so you could buy unlimited altcoins while hurting confidence in bitcoin, creating huge arbitrage opportunities for you. Thus SegWit does not make a 51% attack any more valuable than it was before because the attack on SegWit would be strictly less profitable than a regular 51% attack, by at least a factor of 20 (100% recognition versus 5% rcognition)

Market economies are dynamically efficient, not stable. Planned economies can seem stable but ultimately fail to react. We don't need to kill the fee market, It's actually good if there are variations in hash rate corresponding to demand at peak times of day and week. The problem is not that we have a fee market. The problem is that we don't have blocksize market.

To get non- mining nodes/wallets on board you would have to do more than play with blocksize. You would have to restrict something they can't ignore during the "soft- fork" phase of the forced soft- hard fork. You could change the signature rules, say require double signing everything with both SegWit-1 ECDSA and SegWit-2 Schnorr signature for everything whereas Schnorr signatures weren't used before. In order to sign any transaction to get into longest chain during the transition period, consumers must upgrade software. Miners who don't upgrade will have blocks rejected because they don't provide a SegWit- 2 Schnorr signature block. Then in the "hard- fork" phase you increase the block size and relax the signature types back to allow regular ECDSA as before, or Schnorr signatures - either one. Now you have larger main blocks and two separate segregated signature blocks, with new consensus mechanisms for adaptive block size and everybody who has used bitcoin recently has been forced to upgrade. Throw in a mimblewimble mergemined sodechain and whatever features lightning network users want added and you just might satisfy everyone.

Confirmations are now a reverse auction. You have to offer a high enough fee to get included in a block. The only way to pay for those fees is with bitcoin. Nice trick, eh? Bitcoin network only accepts bitcoins for fees. You can move fiat with fiat backed/denominated colored coins like Tether- USD. But paying the associated fees costs bitcoins. Hence higher fees and a backed up mempool means more demand for bitcoin. The only thing skyrocketing is the price. If price was still 10 BTC/USD these fees would be negligible.

Perhaps but the inflation in intended to jump start security. Although it's likely that sufficient security can be maintained with even modest fees, it's also likely that limitations in bandwidth will drive up fees. Even if LN makes it such that you need only ever make maybe 2 transaction per year (which is quite optimistic), at 6-7 tps bitcoin can only support about 100 million such lightweight users. Concurrently as fees take up more proportion of miner reward, the deflationary impact of halvening events become smaller. If fees increase faster than mining reward increases, is bitcoin still deflationary or does it matter? If you are poor it would be better to speculate while bitcoin is young and has low fees because even if the protocol doesn't change the usability and fundamentals may become more adverse with time.

The only way to cut volatility is for more share of market to be controlled by market makers, people who maintain both bid and ask offers and profit on the spread, than by speculators. Only way that happens is for market makers to profit faster than pure hodlers or other timing strategies. That requires random volatility to be large in comparison to price growth or even predictable movements. So we need volatility now to end volatility later. But as soon as volatility does diminish, wealth preservationists and speculators will be attracted into crypto causing a new cycle of boom, bubble, and bust.

International wire transfers cost over $40 to send without currency conversion, about $10 (varies) to receive, and they aren't working on the problem. Bitcoin costs $0.02 (2500 times less) and there are multiple fixes in the works - even though Bitcoin has security that can't be penetrated by the world's supercomputers which is supposed to eventually be paid for by fees. There are also many exchanges that offer free internal transfers, and bitinstant that offers instant transactions between exchanges for a tiny fee. When I send "free" transfers between my own accounts at different banks they take about a week, some if which time I earn no interest on that money so I'm losing value to inflation. Moving money faster costs something usually - even if it's gasoline or time to walk cash over myself - and I still lose a day's interest at least.

Not necessarily. They are operating under the paradigm that some transactions are more spammy than others: Some users are doing more transactions than they really need, and thus would do substantially similar value transfers with fewer transactions as fees rise. For instance gambling sites could change their thresholds for minimum deposit or minimum withdrawl and greatly reduce number of transactions while improving user experience - as less time is spent on transfers and more on gambling. (Gamblers aren't very rational people.) Similarly people do CoinJoins in a just-enough-for-now manner, but they could tumble larger amounts less often for fewer transactions and save more money than just the transaction fees.

At this point it's probably not feasible for anyone - even state actors - to obtain majority hash power before LN activated. So the network capacity issue is rather irrelevant.

There is no "wrong" reason to use Bitcoin. Bitcoin is a spendable reserve currency. Because it's easily spendable, unlike gold and silver, it need not be used as a reserve. Because it's a reserve currency, unlike rubles, it need not be spent. Furthermore it's known monetary policy and limited money supply make it a superior reserve currency, while it's irreversible transactions and double spend protection make it a superior electronic cash. Thus Bitcoin offers choices and creates value.

Send £1 to exchange. Sell on LocalBitcoins for £1.05 and buy for £1 on exchange simultaneously. Repeat but with $1.05 and £1.1025. Repeat for 269 total iterations. 
(£1.00 in Bitcoin + £1.00 fiat) X 1.05^269 = ~ £ 1 million worth total.
Of course you will probably have some difficulty selling or moving less than £5 or more than £10k (or some other numbers on that order), and avoiding getting scammed can be challenging. But in principle a very small amount could grow very large with market arbitrage while you, say, live in your mother's basement and avoid meaningful productive work - and your £1 worth is a significant fraction of what you need to start testing such a system.

I gather the consensus seems to be to use default settings. However if you are mining you would want to set maxblocksize to 1000000 (1000k) rather than default 750000 (750k) so I don't necessarily buy that the other defaults are correct for everyone either.  
My question would be, how do you measure resource usage versus resource capacity to determine that your settings are reasonable? Bandwidth upload/download for blocks and unconfirmed transactions, memory usage, processor power for confirming blocks and for unconfirmed transactions?
Also if you intend to provide a node to fill a hole (or lack of redundancy) in local coverage, how do you measure the ratio of relayed messages from local IP address users to nonlocal IP address users?
Also if you just wish to help the network by forwarding transactions that will likely be mined but not spam, how do you measure the fraction of relayed transaction being eventually included in blocks?

I don't quite catch your meaning, but it certainly is true that if an exchange allowed people to place "maker only" orders and gave makers half the taker commission charged, you could just end up with a negative spread and confuse people. Likewise charging fees to makers tends to create a positive spread and obfuscate the true price - though not so confusing to experienced/knowledgeable traders. It's much cleaner to have 0% maker fee to attract liquidity and a small taker fee to cover the exchange's service. Then you possibly can get spreads close to price granularity and have a meaningful ticker price - the last price at which a maker transacted.

I'll describe a simple idea that can be done manually with limit orders but also easier to maintain with a bot. Maintain a spread much higher than commissions. For each 2% more than spread the price goes down, buy with 1%-2% of your USD available. If price goes up 2% more than spread, sell 1%-2% of your Bitcoin available. 
Having said that as typical rules, you might want to be a little aggressive with buying if you want to get some initial portfolio position before mining subsidy halving, just in case it moons.

"What is the point of removing Gavin now"
"You don't need to convince me of Gavin failures"
You seem to have some cognitive dissonance. You see Gavin's failures as harmless. They are proof - not just evidence but positive proof - of a social hack, and mods remove permissions from hacked accounts. It would be grossly irresponsible to not remove his permissions.
As for the block size limit, it's not about memory it's about processing time for verification which grows parabolically. Gavin, again, demonstrates that he is a vector for a social hack by promoting making the network more vulnerable to attack vectors and refusing to listen to reason or consider alternatives.

Lol. Are you a federal agent? I'm talking about the Satoshi stash, that is, to be specific, the unmoved mined bitcoin's stored with public keys for addresses from 2009-2010. There is plenty of online information about the Satoshi stash. But let's do some maths: 
(50 BTC/ 10 minutes) * (1440 minutes/day) = 7200 BTC/day for first 4 years. If there were 7 people mining, they would have each got about 1000 Bitcoin per day. From Hash rates one can infer that the unmoved Bitcoin mostly was likely mined by one computer in continuous operation from block 1  until the protocol changed to increase security so mining reward was sent to addresses rather than public keys. So anybody who has given this matter much consideration for purposes of due diligence has "seen" evidence of such a wallet.
Or did you think that Satoshi is my gay lover? Lol.

Your spread is too small. Spread is like profit margin. Trading volume/2 (or sell side volume) is like gross. Look at the order book and imitate it. Rather than trading a one tick spread, step one tick in front of a wall. Alternatively look at volatility and choose a spread that optimizes profit. As a market maker you are providing liquidity. Don't make that liquidity cheap - make it only a marginal improvement over the big players, and make it optimal for YOU not the other side of the trade. Bitcoin is volatile. Use that volatility to your advantage.

Meh. Simple majority not so much.. In the past once 75% super majority is reached it hits 95% very quickly. My theory is that 20% wish to avoid motivating such an attack against themselves, more so than they care about voting timely per se. The point here is that there is a fuzzy boundary between simple majority (51%), rational preference ordering supermajority (75%), and consensus (95%) not just because voting is statistical and meritocratic rather than populist, but because ballots aren't secret and an attack vector exists. 75% becomes some sort of meta-threshold, where the mere possibility of attack by a coalition becomes incentive to change one's vote even before threats are communicated or attacks planned.

If you are a USA citizen what you are "supposed" to do is file FBARs for any account that held more than $10k worth of (fiat) currency at any time. That includes online poker rooms, overseas bank accounts, exchanges, etc. This is a hassle mainly because it's paperwork you are unfamiliar with - it's actually pretty simple. But let's assume you wish to avoid this requirement. It's not clear that bitcoin balances would count towards that threshold or total account balance, as they are capital goods. One article I read said bitcoin is more akin to diamonds in a safety deposit box, not reportable on an FBAR. It's, possible thus to convert like $5k at a time and avoid the FBAR filings. However then you might as well use Coinbase Exchange, which enforces a $10k limit for on-exchange value. Alternatively you could sell via P2P services at about 5% mark-up in the USA. Either way you are supposed to pay taxes on this stuff, as gambling income or as capital gains depending on whether you have a cost basis (making it trading profit) or whether it's gambling profit. In your case maybe some of each. It's very difficult to renounce USA citizenship and they'll make you pay 6 years back taxes and prove you don't have unreported income before they allow renouncing citizenship. It's almost easier to buy a new identity with foreign citizenship and take online winnings under that identity but I don't know if/how that can be done reliably or the (il)legality, and there are other subreddit(s) for that.

Yes, Bitfinex has margin trading and a loan market to go along with it. Within the USA derivatives run into SEC regulations which are very onerous. I believe Coinbase Exchange or any exchange would do it if it were trivial. It's a huge destabilization threat to the existing financial sector though because USD margin trading rates are wildly incongruent between Bitcoin exchanges and more well established exchanges. Exchanges in China and perhaps Europe are outside SEC jurisdiction though but USD is still used as a reserve currency and there is little regulation except for capital controls which typically only limit how fast they can move money out of the country, not how they trade with it within the country. There are a bunch of angles to look at, both possibilities and road blocks. Road blocks are what create persistent arbitrage though so it's critical to understand those.

Hardforks are more a problem with wallets and various other clients. Requiring 95% consensus vote gets the mining community on board and u please dated *before* the hard work is *scheduled* to activate, with a grace period for the remaining 5%. So it's the non-mining client software, such as consumer oriented wallets, exchanges, markets, escrow services, etc, that present a problem. Softforks solve this by not breaking anything so old software still works. Hardforks by definition include something that old clients would reject. In that case multistage upgrades as in a series of softforks might provide a safety buffer to soften the hardfork, so only years old clients break, not ones that are a couple months old.

Anyway, the fact that you are equating security of trusted central authorities with trustless decentralized miners makes me expect that you basically don't know what you are talking about. Those are different creatures. There have been several cases just recently of the SWIFT system being hacked but not Bitcoin miners being hacked.
Individual miners have incentives to maintain control of the mining equipment they possess. Authorities like nationalism states, on the other hand, often have changes of leadership, with adversarial political parties and politicians swapping positions. This means that government identity systems are under the curatorship of people with perverse incentives to undermine the credibility of the next person to take office by leaving a deadman switch in the form of security flaws and backdoors. 
Also hard coding in the software who is trusted would allow attackers to locate those authorities and subvert them, even if those authorities aren't self-sabotaging. It's a huge security risk.

If, say, half the miners (by hash rate) drop out then the remaining half get more Bitcoin, cancelling the halving effects. So we can expect 50% as an upper limit for drop out, even if most miners were only marginally profitable. The majority of hash power will have newer, higher performance equipment and cheaper electricity than the typical bitcoin hobbyist. That unequal access is partly what drives centralization and mining contracts, etc. Even without patents there are trade secrets. Thus the drop out rate is likely less than what you might expect based on your own, personal experience with profitability of mining.

Problem with relying on Bitcoin markets for a reliable prediction of price is that they have a steep time value of money. When I checked last leverage cost 15% per year compounded daily. That's not brokerage fees, that is what the loaners charge. That's like over three times corporate bonds rates. I don't know if that is opportunity cost or cost of risk of using the exchange - but either way the leverage buyers are borrowing at that rate so also value money that highly. So although it's a profound disconnect from the outside economy, we can say bitcoiners have a high time value of money which seems to imply an expectation that prices will go up at 15% per year. If fiat inflation is 3% that leaves 12% per year or 1% per month implied expected price growth.
One could also look at arbitrage opportunities on P2P markets for time value of money, but that involves a labor component and maybe regulatory risks for large players so it's not so straightforward.

The "instant buy" with credit card on fees on Coinbase is comparable to markups in P2P markets.  It's not a true exchange, it's a retail transaction. Coinbase exchange only uses cleared funds. There aren't any exchanges that allow people to trade on pure credit. That's like infinite leverage. There was a precious metals microexchange that did that, allowed you to mail a check after purchase, but they went bankrupt.

If people don't expect price to go up, why are interest rates on margin contracts several times larger for USD than for BTC on Bitfinex? You see, the market price today is not a prediction market. Futures, options, margin loans - these have time components, they are about future prices not just momentary balance of supply and demand. Margin contracts for USD on a Bitcoin exchange are similar to call options or futures contracts on Bitcoin. In all three cases you get to buy at (say) today's price but pay later, in exchange for a small premium. Details vary, but it is a prediction - and that prediction right now is that upside risk exceeds downside risk.

Land value tax and certain excise taxes on limited resources such as precious minerals mining are more economically efficient than income tax or sales tax anyway. Think of income tax or sales tax as a landlord who wants 20% of your net income and 8% of your gross, whereas land tax is flat rate rent per area. Which landlord will attract higher value tenants? No landlord would be as stupid as the government. Generally any tax system that is bypassed simply by not documenting cash floor was a stupid tax system disconnected from reality and open to corruption to start with. Income tax was implemented during a period of unusual patriotism, nationalism, and increasing movement towards centralized, corporate organizations. Corporations are beginning to lose employees, so trends are reversing. The tax systems that corporations promulgated is basically a dead, zombie-like, unworkable system already.

How does the market price it in though? Market makers don't decide prices, they just spread trade. Hoddlers/mooners think its worth more at any price. People using it for commerce just care about short term down side volatility risk. Who exactly prices in the halvening, and how? It's not like options trading with Black-Sholes (sp?) formula. We don't have a formula for the fair price of Bitcoin. Those who have tried often come up with larger values than the current market value. The fundamentals are also different than altcoins. Bitcoin is largely the reserve currency of altcoins.
On the other hand, I don't think exchange rate will immediately spike at the first 12.5 bitcoin block, 10 minutes into halving. Rather I think there is a time horizon for rational prediction, because people are busy with how to maximize profit n the next X weeks,  and may ignore larger time horizons, even if that results ultimately in a musical chairs game like panic.

Do spread trading to provide liquidity so price stabilizes. That will help the price if Bitcoin rise more than just holding. If price goes sideways you end up with more fiat AND more Bitcoin. Since Bitcoin supply is limited, eventually price will rise from spread traders accumulating and/or price stability attracting noobs.
Edit:This close the halving isn't necessarily an ideal time to switch from hodling to spread trading, but in general a 75% Bitcoin / 25% fiat allocation with spreads adjusted to recent one days swings can work OK. Use the spread trades to maintain the allocation.

Movement of Bitcoin is not restricted by the Great Firewall. Even mining pools - which are much more time sensitive than transacters since lag of even 4 seconds could mean an extra orphaned block every day - get miners from outside China voluntarily joining Chinese pools for like a 1% difference in payouts.

(1) Consensus already moved against BIP109.
(2) Why would miners not like fee doubling?
(3) Since fees are less than half the mining subsidy, the deflationary pressure from subsidy halving would be more than the cost of fee doubling for the typical user. And fee doubling would likely last only about 2 or 3 weeks before difficulty adjusts.
(4) SegWit is a solution with more consensus.
(5) Miners are lowering their soft limit on transaction size. This reflects the parabolic time for validating/verifying maliciously designed transactions. BIP 109 does not have a hard limit that reflects these new soft limits.
(6) If fees were reduced right before subsidy halving, it would force more miners to stop. It makes more sense to role out capacity increasing softforks 2 weeks before or 2 weeks after subsidy halving, not at the same time.

Just set up spread trading with limit orders on an exchange. Use the one day high/low difference plus maker commissions for spread. For ever 2% it goes down buy in with 1% of your fiat. For every 2% more than spread it goes up sell off 1% of your bitcoin.  You will profit off the spread rather than lose money, and you will approach 50% vesting in Bitcoin assymptotically. If you want more vesting you can change to 2% buy in for each 2% drop.

No, the evidence points to either/both:
(A) Satoshi Nakomoto is an anagram for "I am Nash. Soto Koto." which is a multilingual code or play on referrants translating to "I am Nash. John Nash." Thus the creator of Bitcoin either was - or was framing - the mathematician John Nash - who was only revealed to have introduced the idea of one way hashes to the NSA after his death - thus indicating either John Nash or someone inside the NSA who knew of this. Also he couldn't stop talking about ideal money during this time, using his Nobel Prize in Economics as a pulpit to explain why something suspiciously like Bitcoin is needed. Etc, etc. Perfect fit except perhaps that young kids have a hard time believing that somebody who was around for the invention of digital computers could code in C++ and impersonate a 37 year old. But we are talking about somebody who is that brilliant, not some random college math professor - and it makes at least as much sense as a Japanese programmer who is "better with code than with words" typing English in perfect imitation of a native speaker.

It's possible to provide anonymity for anybody not contesting how their vote was counted, while still allowing votes to be contested by a voter at the risk of breaking his anonymity, by hashing voter ID, ballot, time stamp, plus a random number nonce or password that only the voter keeps after hashing. Put the hash in the blockchain, along with the ballot, and as a separate record list voter ID and time stamp. Only give the complete information to the voter for validation. If the correct ballot with that hash doesn't appear, only then does the voter file a complaint, most likely in a class action. Voter fraud - double voting or voting by deceased people - can be detected by the list of voter ID's and time stamps. Location stamp/ machine number could be used in addition to time stamp. The system I describe above can be improved upon - it's just a concept.

The only "attacks" you can do with 1% I can think of are:
* Double spending unconfirmed transaction of your own money. Actually anybody can do that, it's just easier if you are mining.
* Mining empty blocks. Oh, you just lost out on fees! Not very economical.
* Mining spam. Again, under current conditions, you just lost out on fees. 
* Mining maliciously constructed 1 MB transactions. Not meaning to repeat, but lose out on fees plus increased chance of orphaning your block because verification time increases.
* Taking part in a larger malicious coalition - which is against your interests.
* Transaction malleability, something being fixed soon if not already - that just means the name or hash lookup given to a transaction is changed so the owner's wallet has more trouble finding it - no permanent harm done. Think of it as your bank changing a check number and ONLY the check number on a check you signed, so when you go to balance your check book it adds up but doesn't exactly match your records just enough to confuse momentarily.

No, it's not quantum safe in theory. A Turing complete quantum computer with perfect coherence could invert SHA256. You just pass a perfectly mixed set of qubits superimposed in every possible state - entangled with a copy of themselves - through a SHA256 function. Then perturb the superimposed output into the desired output. Read the copy of the original input. Easier said than done of course.
It just happens that, at least so far, coherence gains in quantum computing have been slow and expensive, so there is no such thing on the horizon, and the entropy in SHA256 magnifies incoherence effects. Quantum computing will likely be well known and commonplace in scientific computing long before it matures to the point of attacking SHA256. So SHA256 isn't quantum safe. It's just imperfect quantum safe.

It's against one's self interest to stand against consensus just for spite, yes. That isn't a 51% attack though, it's a counter measure against consensus breaking sabotage.

The next big breakthrough will be the scalable distributable block web ledgers. It differs from block chain in that it need not be linear - non-conflicting forks are allowed to all be incorporate as parents of a later block, reducing the need or risk for orphaning. Forks behind censorship walls can persist to be recombined later as long as there are no double spends or other inconsistencies. Also Dapps can use distributed computation akin to supercomputers, and lightning network channels can resolve local transactions instantly despite censorship at national borders or other such firewall-like problems.
The collection of all interoperable side chains, block chains, block webs, Dapps, and DAO's will be called the inter block network, or interblock for short. Tasks that earn tokens in the interblock, once called mining, will be called blockwork in the future. "Blockwork like clockwork" will be a slogan, indicating the superior efficiency of the new technology.

The way to corner a market safely is to do spread trading, buying more than you sell though. Rather than cause volatility you contribute to liquidity and price stabilization while accumulating. Problem with metals is that in the long run you will cause more mining. You can only corner the market if the supply is inelastic ... like one year onion futures (since onions take two years to grow) ... or Bitcoin.

(1) SegWit alone would clear the current congestion
(2) LN should be close behind that.
(3) I gather that the dev team has funding to work on side chains too, which also allows diverse types of trustless off-chain transactions.
(4) I think dynamic block size will likely be added after those features. It's just that mining fees need to be on the same order as subsidy in order for it to matter, so it's not a priority in the short term.
(5) I think it would be interesting if people just directly paid particular mining pools off-chain. Maybe LN will allow that. People can just open up channels with mining pools and everytime a transaction is processed by that pool they pay the going rate, indicating off-chain which transactions are theirs and dynamically update bids based on ask prices from all pools and personal urgency. Basically LN would enable an efficient fee market implemented with AI in wallets.

I don't know an easy way to flip a profit in India. Where I am it's possible to flip bitcoin between exchanges and P2P markets at a several percent profit. Also various people have utilities included in leases which allows, at least in theory, a sort of exit scam where a tenant plugs in some bitcoin miners for a few months between starting and ending a lease. It's actually a pretty bad idea though, sort of malicious or at least acting in bad faith, and I've never done it nor do I intend to. There are more complicated and illegal methods of subterfuge and graft, but I digress. The real point here though is that the competition may have cheaper electricity than is feasible for most people. You shouldn't expect mining to be profitable just because.

A bank teller once asked me "Do you buy coin?" perhaps flirtatiously while processing a wire transfer to Bitstamp. I told her that I'm doing complex arbitrage between national currencies, Bitcoin, and precious metals between multiple international markets. My feeling is that anybody who calls it "coin" is phishing - and quite likely for law entrapment officers rather than (ironically) "legitimate" scammers. "Coin" sounds dirty because it's use as street slang for hard cash predates Bitcoin, and removing the "Bit" from Bitcoin obfuscates it's futurist legitimacy. After that I started looking into online banking wire transfers and other alternatives. I also report all unwanted suspicious robocalls or solicitations via the National Do Not Call List website.

The biggest profits usually are between exchanges and P2P markets. Persistent arbitrage on exchanges usually relate to cost (including value of your own time, time value of money, counterparty risk) of moving or keeping money there. People who program API's can make money on *one* exchange. It's called time arbitrage. People willing to move money constantly might go the P2P route. Moving between exchanges is a middle ground that probably requires more finnesse or more capital, because it involves moving money but at a reduced return versus P2P.

* Require 100% reserve. Not necessarily cash reserve, but assets that won't go down in value long term.
* Not allow double spends or overdraft.
* Don't have a good hash rate economy - unless government allows "miners" to print fiat or someone is willing to pay very large fees. 
* Even if decentralized payment processing is used, reserves suffer from the same problems as centralized services. Feds confiscate even a fraction of reserves and confidence is shaken. A run on the "bank" ensues. No reserves left.

Ethereum Hard Fork Update
We wanted to provide some clarity to GDAX users who are concerned with the recent Ethereum hard fork. GDAX supports trading and withdrawals only for the ETH (Ethereum) network and currently does not support ETC (Ethereum Classic). Customers are advised not to deposit ETC or any unsupported digital currency to GDAX.
For customers who had ETH balances on GDAX immediately prior to the hard fork on July 20, 2016:
    100% of ETC associated with ETH balances at the time of the hard fork are secured in GDAX cold storage.
    We plan to allow the withdrawal of an amount of ETC that corresponds to ETH balances at the time of the hard fork. We'll be working on this feature over the coming weeks and will provide updates via the GDAX Twitter acount.
ETC associated with ETH sent to GDAX after the hard fork is not supported by GDAX. We currently do not have plans to support ETC trading on GDAX (although we are not philosophically opposed to any particular hard fork or coin). We will continue to monitor the situation and evaluate customer demand for new digital assets to add to the platform.

I think about it as five distinct issues:
* Short term benefits
* Long terms benefits
* Short term toxicity
* Long term toxicity (especially from prolonged use)
* Cost
The animal studies combined with anecdotal reports from people on Longecity who started about a year before I did persuaded me that it's non toxic in the short term, and that it has short term benefits for some people such as increased stamina (classic transient side effects of nerve tonics even - pinched nerves regenerating can hurt - I consider it a good sign when the main or only 'negative' side effect reported is consistent with that explanation). Cost is all over the place, but generally much cheaper to mix oneself for anything much more than a sample size. Long term benefits and long term toxicity are very uncertain. I'm perhaps pushing my personal risk tolerance now though as I've been taking it longer than the mice did, and roughly 80% as long as anybody who posts anecdotal reports online. I'm not a good anecdotal case study though because I had chronic health problems going into this which I've been self treating in various ways. My use of C60/EVOO at this point is largely driven by instinctual preference at this point. I still like various vegetable oils such as hemp and red palm but plain olive oil feels like it's missing something.

A soft fork is a fork where old clients will accept the new chain so network will converge to one chain if the new chain is the longest.
Hard fork is a fork where old clients will reject the new chain so network will diverge even if new chain is the longest.
There has never been a BIP implemented by consensus that required all old clients to update. If there had been then you could run an old client and it would reject the current chain. Therefore all successful bitcoin forks so far have been softforks.
Many altcoins or testnets could be considered minority hardforks but that is pedantic.

USA customers can send money to Coinbase/GDAX with free ACH transfers. They can do this even with small amounts. Other exchanges require expensive wire transfers. If the price difference is 1.0% And Bitstamp charges 0.25% on trades and wire transfer is $50 then to make Bitstamp cheaper for buying you need to send over X money at a time where: 
(1.0% - 0.25%)X =$50.
X=$50/(0.0075)= $6,666.67
You might get lower break even points for other exchanges but typically you need to be moving thousands of dollars at a time to make the price differences pay for wire transfers.

Have you even read the notices the exchanges sent out? The typical notices shared a couple salient point:
(1) Trading and withdrawl of Eth will cease one hour before hard fork activation.
(2) Trading will resume only after a clear winner is known, a longest chain, by whichever criteria the exchange has or will specify.
(3) All on-exchange Eth in accounts will be redeemable for Eth on winning chain only.
(4) It's well implied that after hard fork activation only deposits from wining chain will be honored.
In other words if the losing chain doesn't for entirely, the exchange gets any Eth they hold on that chain for free.

How is OneCoin even a money system?
I take bitcoin I buy on an exchange, and turn around and sell it at several percent markup on P2P services. The people I sell to take the bitcoin and buy things - steam games, Amazon goods, pharmaceuticals from India, advertisement space on Backpage - things that either can be bought only with bitcoin, or are substantially cheaper or faster with bitcoin due to no chargeback risk.
What can you buy only with OneCoin? What can you buy cheaper or faster with OneCoin? How you can buy OneCoin and immediately sell it again at over 100 ROI?

The funny thing about this for me is that during the last bubble I did lose my job but never told off my boss. It was a temporary job, I had it twice as long as it was supposed to exist. They terminated me, tried to create some bullshit reasons other than lack of available work and I was just zen. My boss had this whole long meeting with me, where he oscillated between trying to get me angry by confronting me with "evidence" of personnel violations (gibberish printouts that supposedly documented inappropriate internet usage but weren't human readable), and talking about how upset he was to lose me because I did such great work. Then he was like, "I've never seen anybody take being fired so well." Never told him what's up, didn't deny anything, didn't admit anything specific. That was the real trap, baiting me into saying something substantial one way or the other. Personnel ended up sending me a formal letter saying that I was terminated for lack of available work.

It's a tragedy of the commons problem, so I think that it's important that we get the incentives right. I would suggest a combination meritocracy and super majority system for a future fork. 95% miner vote required to initiate fork as usual. Block size limit is X (currently 1 Mb). Difficulty is Hx. If miner wishes to use higher block size Y, he must mine at difficulty Hy= Hx * x/y. However his block Mined at difficulty h counts as a difficulty (h*y/x) so if everyone did this block size would get larger rather than difficulty adjusting. Miners also vote on new block size limit be declaring a suggested new block size limit V such that H &lt;= V &lt;= Max Hy from last 2016 blocks. Each 2016 blocks the new block size is set equal to the bottom 5th percentile of V, called V5.  So the new x' is set at x'=V5. When new default block size is chosen difficulty is also adjusted up H'=H*x'/x, where N is what the difficulty otherwise would be. In this way block sizes would be instantaneously adjustable based on difficuld if mining fees incentivize that or a miner just wants it that much, but can also be permanently adjusted by consensus if anybody bother to mine larger blocks and everyone (or 95%) wants a larger size too.

Remember that for balanced portfolio, profit scales proportional to the product of volume and spread (after fees).  The larger your spread, the less volume you will have. You can try to adapt your spread dynamically based on volatility measures on various time scales - the shorter time scales probably requiring bots to stay competitive - the longer time scales requiring some discipline. It's easier to take a 30% swing and stick to the plan if your bot handles it while you are asleep in a few hours, than if you handle it manually over days and weeks.

If the current price of Bitcoin that you can buy is P and you have opportunity to sell for Q where Q&gt;P, you should sell at Q and buy at P. You should only sell at most 1/T of your remaining bitcoin per day where T is the amount of time it takes you to move fiat around and use it to re-buy. This should equilibrate to having about half your money in bitcoin and half in transit for arbitrage.

I find it really obnoxious how some people want proof of stake "mining" subsidy just so they can sit back and passively earn interest without any ongoing contribution. Hash proof secures the network against brute force attack and thus adds value. There are existing ways to earn interest, such as (from least to most risky) JoinMarket, immediate arbitrage (between exchanges or P2P), time arbitrage (e.g. spread trading and predictive trading), and even, yes, mining. All those things add value in ways that hodling just doesn't.
The simplicity of longest chain inspires confidence. If we start voting on which chains are valid there is serious risk if Bitcoin turning into an arbitrary plutocracy, rather than a constitutional meritocracy. Most hodlers aren't interested in actively overseeing the block chain. A consortium of exchanges, payment processors, banks, and other big money interests could use PoS to block vote to censor certain types of chains, thus disincentivizing mining of certain transactions. This PoS gives regulators an avenue for political control - the CIA or KJB could hold a gun to the head of a CEO and make him invalidate transactions from the unbanked of Africa using votes from his customer's Bitcoin.
Having said that, I would be OK with PoS voting on BIP's, since hodlers supposedly have aligned interest with long term value of Bitcoin, and it would create decentralization pressure as most hoddlers would be more interested in voting on a ballot issue than on overseeing transaction processing that is supposed to be automated.

Bitcoin is private money. Perhaps you refer to it's traceability? There are plans to implement Schnorr signatures, which would get one step closer to ring signatures.

If you have cash and you are in USA or Europe you can buy bitcoin through bitquick.co. If you have a bank account with one of the banks they list on their site you can sell. They are licensed money transmitters unlike localbitcoins.com so you are operating within the regulation system and yet they mostly only do the AML/KYC checks required by government not the overzealous bankster collusion of banning customers for no reason.

If memory serves correctly ... That was when Bitcoin was worth roughly $10 with ATH of roughly $30, so that was only about $135 in fees. Transaction fees in terms of bitcoin were much higher and fixed by default but utxo's with large bitcoin-days were free to transact by default and fees (I'm terms of bitcoin) hadn't changed much from when Bitcoin had no market value. I think the next year with rising prices and ASICs overtaking mining saw a restructuring of the fee markets to first reduced fees then a flexible few market.

It's not just the electricity. It's the triple threat:
(A) Electricity that is fundamentally cheap because power plants were built in places without industry.
(B) Specialists making cutting edge ASIC's that they use themselves and only sell - or only ship - when doing so benefits THEM - meaning the buyer will mine at a loss.
(C) Mining is fixed total supply and you are competing with cloud mining or bitcoin banks that are semi-ponzi fractional reserve schemes - they are profitable only if or only because some people never cash out or they get lucky.
Compare those unknowns and risks to buying bitcoin off an exchange and *immediately* selling it for more on a P2P market. The one week ROI for mining is zero versus over 100% for arbitrage.

Bitcoin was NOT the first attempt at private electronic money. It built on past failures, addressing past problems, and Libertarians generally did not support it until it was proven. It only seemed that Libertarians were jumping on a bandwagon because they had more information about past failed private electronic money systems and so understood better that Bitcoin had addressed certain problems.
Eth is a first generation or first attempt at a smart contract platform that just happens to use blockchain/Bitcoin code without knowing if that solves problems of smart contracts. It deliberately ignores known problems like unpredictable behavior of Turing Complete programs, and much of the design intent - e.g. monetary policy - is too flexible/malleable to be trusted as money. The use of a non-standard operation set prohibits code reuse or compatibility, requiring reinventing the wheel on every level. That exacerbates the Turing Complete unpredictability.

It's a moving target, and it will vary by network participant. You can estimate verification time based on percentage of empty blocks.
(Average Verification Time)
    = (Fraction of Empty Blocks)*(10 minutes)
    = (Fraction of Empty Blocks)*(600 seconds)
    = (Percentage of Empty Blocks)*(6 seconds)
Preferably you would extract the data directly from the blockchain. However, just for sake of argument you can go to this recent news source:
And eyeball what you think is a fair average to plug into that formula. June 2016 was around 1%-2%.  2% gives 12 seconds. 1% gives 6 seconds. I was low-balling the estimate with 2 seconds. We might get there soon though.
Alternatively, you can look at time stamp difference between blocks for particular empty blocks, throw out any suspicious outliers that may be empty blocks for some other reason, and consider twice the average (mean or mode) to be the average verification time. That might give more consistent results over time.
More importantly, latency for typical users - rather than large mining pools - are even larger, as discussed at this link:

I use Python scripts. I preprocess trades into lists of total BTC bought and sold each days, with total USD. Then I have another loop that goes through and matches those, subtracting out BTC and proportionate USD from the buy/sale list as they are moved over to the matched list. When I run out of sells it's done. If I run out of buys first then the rest has no cost basis. Otherwise I save the remaining buys for cost basis in later years. The matched list is output to a CVS file that is easily turned into a capital gains worksheet, with all the appropriate columns. Fifo versus lifo is just like one line of code different.

Print out these insttructions for future review. Setup a JoinMarket wallet. Write down the seed. Output a bunch of public addresses. Practice wallet recovery from the seed, make sure you get the same public addresses as the first time. Learn how to change the gap limit. Learn how to run a yield generator and a tumbler. Make a list of addresses from external branch of one mix depth (say mix depth zero). Receive your bitcoin there - but only for anonymous stuff. Once you get payment run your yield generator or tumbler. Withdraw from another mix depth several hops away, say mix depth four.
There is a periodic attack on JoinMarket but it is pretty well defeated by being both a maker and taker and restarting scripts each time about half your coins change mix depths. When you are ready to cash out just output your private keys from the withdrawl mix depth and import or sweep them all into another wallet.

$35 won't even buy you an international wire transfer from a major national bank. Until recently with Robinhood it wasn't enough to do stock trading without losing precipitously. Unless you get real lucky early on it probably won't get you far at casino advantage play even if you can count cards and do perfect index play. But $35 is great for bitcoin arbitrage. Go sell on paxful or localbitcoins or bitquick at some steep markup and buy back in.

Miner reward subdidy halving has twice kicked off a bull market. The first time the market hardly accounted for that ahead of time, the bull market started only afterwards. The second time many people did account for it, which just made the bull run start earlier and ramp up even steeper afterwards. Both times there were other factors at play that "explained" the bull run, and bull markets have had other causes. But I'm pretty sure that the "now or never" psychology and anticipated shortage will cause a speculative bull run again shortly before the next halving, which will continue for some months afterward.

Another solution is to have the makers scan the blockchain for coinjoin-like UTXO's, and run a sybil attack against the snoop where sometimes they offer UTXO's that don't belong to them. A persistent snoop trying to compile all maker UTXO's would thus end up with a list off all UTXO's in the blockchain  that are plausibly from coinjoins - and even some that aren't. The only way for the snoop to distinguish genuine maker UTXO's is to procede with signing a transaction that pays the coinjoin fees. But then the taker will only know maker UTXO's and will be paying to make JoinMarket happen, and makers can raise prices and the attack gets progressively more expensive.

We already have off-chain transactions through trusted intermediaries like exchanges. On- chain transactions and lightning/thunder networks are only needed for restless transactions.

What are you trying to incentivize? Bitcoin hash rate is sufficient to prevent 51% attack from state actors using their super computers by a margin of several orders of magnitude. Hash rate has not dropped but increased from two weeks ago. Even if it had dropped by 50% across all mining pools it wouldn't matter. 
If you want to fight centralization with mining fees, develop a wallet that does a double spend attack as follows:
1. Prepare two transaction that are almost identical except one has a slightly larger mining few. The change address is correspondingly a different amount.
2. Broadcast the larger fee transaction to small mining pools or associated nodes (say, those outside China).
3. Immediately broadcast the smaller fee transaction to large mining pools or associated nodes (say, those inside China).

The theory that they have publicly promulgated as I understand in my own words, is that:
(A) They only planned on splitting their cold storage initially, not the hot wallet. So they initially leaked their own ETC not user's ETC because they wanted to resume ETH withdrawl ASAP.
(B) They split their hot wallet later, only once, while withdrawls were halted.
(C) They aren't supporting ETC deposits nor continuosly splitting deposits/withdrawls, so if you deposit ETC or unspllt ETH, the replay attack will likely leak the ETC through their hot wallet.

The author seems really confused about how governance of Bitcoin works and about the mathematics of political science and voting systems. Technically a softfork could be pushed through by a 51% attack. 75% threshold is needed to ensure ration preference ordering by the group assuming individuals are rational. This is why technical standards committees - which wish to make changes only as progressive improvements rather than cyclic indecisiveness - have about 75% thresholds. However Core's forking BIPs require 95% consensus. This is a huge supermajority which preserves networking effect and historically has cost very little in delays versus the 75% threshold. Unlike other voting systems, Bitcoin miners are constantly voting on proposed BIP's.  Some proposals may expire, but the polls never close and the legislature is always in session. The weak link in Bitcoin's governance is the centralization of the dev team. However we do not need additional dev teams to fix that. Classic and XT were the wrong idea. Rather we need - eventually - a way to vote on the proposing of proposals, such that anybody can propose a BIP, but only those with say &gt; 2/3 will get to testnet, opened to amendment by &gt;2/3, and final incorporation requiring 3/4 to close amendments and 95% to finalize quickly. I wouldn't mind if there was an alternative route for smaller thresholds between 75% and 95% but they should take longer, upto two years. Anything above 75% preserves rational preference ordering but anything under 100% has some risk of losing network effect.

First, many other issues have been addressed. Second, this is the best we got now. Similar projects have disappeared without getting past testing. Third the project perhaps isn't well funded. Fourth, it does work, it just could be improved upon. Fifth, attacks are detectable and it seems one only appeared about a month ago even though the problem has been known for a year. Sixth, and most importantly, the attack doesn't even work. Let me elaborate on that last point.
Consider: Suppose that everybody running JoinMarket runs a maker bot, and changes nicknames frequently (or use multiple nicknames simultaneously). Even the takers run a maker bot, and then additionally use a taker script when they want to move money. All this attack will accomplish is to identify everybody as a maker. Once the attacker has identified a coinjoin transaction that consists entirely of makers, he rationally concludes that his information is meaningless: Makers and takers are not distinct sets and thus takers can't be identified by process of ellimination. To protect your anonymity all you need do is be both a maker and a taker. Further, if you are a guilty-as-sin-taker and want to mislead the attacker into believing you are a maker for sure: offer up the same utxo's over and over again without signing them. This just requires running a yield generator with one line of code commented out.

Let's assume for the sake of argument that it's too late to buy in because price will move sideways for the next month or two or even a year. So what is the best interest rate you can get on USD instead? Oh, margin lending on cryptocurrency exchanges. And what is the cheapest way to fund those accounts for small amounts of say $50 to $1000? Patiently buy bitcoin from an exchange that offers free bank transfers in your country, send to margin lending account (maybe send to personal wallet inbetween), then sell it for USD.

* They gave away EthC for free by not splitting it in their hot wallet. Think about the tax implications - both for them and their customers - to have accidental asset transfers, give aways, and seizures not documented in their trading history but permanently documented on a blockchain.
* They close accounts of customers who send money to suspected illicit destinations - sometimes even when the destination is lawful by the rules of the customer's jurisdiction.
* They accidentally cancel or double bank transfers of instant buys, allegedly only when it profits them at the expense of the customer.
* They took sides in the hardfork by supporting forked Eth and not supporting classic Eth.
* They have an exchange with withdrawl limits that severely limit arbitrage and no margin trading - resulting in flash crashes.
* Their KYC/MAL policies are intrusive.

Unfortunately they are literally comparable. The comparison has little economic meaning though other than that an attack on the Bitcoin network would likely be cheaper and more feasible with ASICs than with supercomputers. It's like talking about how many manual shovelers would be needed to build the world's largest machine excavation project. The only meaningful conclusion is that nobody would do it that way.

Well the declining sunspot cycle is pretty adverse now, stocks - especially growth stocks (high or no PE ratio) - should crash based on that. The presidency changeover should hurt the next 1.5 years. It's widespread knowledge that quantitative easing - electronic fiat creation - was used to keep market value artificially high, to stop dips and corrections and thus shake out weak hands. Such blatant central planning (not just regulation) of the stock market has hurt the morale of many market idealists. Some might go so far as to call it market manipulation. It also makes shorting horribly dangerous.

In October 2013 the market makers were just finally stabilizing the price from the April bubble, which easily could have predicted a price rise because of strong support and no more weak hands. Then the Silk Road was taken down, and people who used Bitcoin out of necessity suddenly needed to buy more, at any price. It was a recipe for a big bubble.

The FUD is strong in this one. Bitcoin doesn't plan for a permanent solution. It plans to keep improving like a Godel machine. Don't know what a Godel machine is? Maybe you should stay away from Turing Complete smart contracts until you learn some computer science.

I send for 2 cents but only to persistent addresses. If I was buying coffee - the equivalent of a debit card swipe - I'd have to pay more ironically than if I'm doing the equivalent of a wire transfer. That is why I hold hope the Lightning Networks can solve the problem somewhat.

Coinbase &lt;&gt; Coindesk.  Coinbase is a portal between fiat banking and Bitcoin, whereas Coindesk is a media outlet.
