i prefer breadwallet since coinbase is an exchange. and i stopped checking the price every 3 minutes months ago... just need time for the hype to wear off. youll only be checking it every 6 minutes or so once you cool off a bit. patience.

I was under the assumption that that is the only way in Canada at the moment, but the other comments in this thread seem to suggest an online method now exists which i was unaware of. So disregard my comment, sorry.

If its the exact same address, it will still work.

your term deposit is absolutely NOT 18%, i can assure you of that, its probably 1.8%. You might get away with a 2.5% term deposit if you invest roughly 250 thousand dollars.

If you can afford roughly a 5 thousand dollar miner, it will make you around 80 dollars a day at current btc prices. So you would be profitable within about 3 or 4 months if the price doesnt change at all, sooner if it goes up. but you also have to buy the power cables, learn how to set it all up so you dont burn your house down, proper cooling systems which all costs money and time as well.

I'm not investing in anything when I buy bitcoin, I'm simply purchasing what I believe to be the new global currency of the world sometime in the future. You should research bitcoin a bit more friendo. I have more faith in bitcoin than I do in the dollar.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:52:11
I think hes judging the morality of bitcoin, not the effectiveness of an investment that it is.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:17:39
The same way you can make a million amount of alternate coins and make no money off them. They only gain value when people believe they have value. So the million alt coins you have made, or forked, are worthless. Only when enough people build the demand for a forked coin, will said forked coin have any value.

never used gdax, but if it lets you send bitcoin directly to an address,  you just gotta scan your breadwallet recieve key.
one warning, be prepared that breadwallet doesnt let you set any priority to the sending transaction fees, its fixed. so each trade will cost you about 10 bucks. thats the only downside, phone wallets like coinami i think let you set the trans cost sacrificing for trans speed of course. coinami is also a good phone wallet btw.
also breadwallet will give you a 12 word code which you need to WRITE DOWN. dont type or keyloggers or text scanners can yank it from your pc. this code will let you recover your bitcoin from any phone on multiple companies apps which run the same code algorythms

by ignoring you mean selling them since you will technically have as much of their coin as you do bitcoin at the time of the fork!

if the exchange allows you access to your own private keys, then youll have access to them since the private keys will be the same for all the different coins. But if the exchange doesnt allow you to see your private keys, then you cant access them.

this guy gets it
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:40:20
its kinda neat, you dont need any id, and no money is involved. you pay bitcoin to leverage bitcoin, i lost 300 bucks and gave up. not for me.
@_date: 2017-12-12 02:55:43
Well, seeing as a professional, safe, extremely intelligent investor would be lucky to make 15% a year on investments, you saying 50% in a few months is nothing is absolutely ridiculous. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:03:50
I dont see bitcoin being able to be used properly until the future. The price has too much potential at the moment, so no one would be comfortable buying with it. the hodlrs are simply waiting until the price reaches its true capacity, and updates have been put in place to provide rapid and cheap transactions. once widespread faith in the cirrency is reached, and updates have been provided, the currency will be viable to use.
That said, the emotional sellers have been around as long as bitcoin has. they do nothing but prove bitcoins worth when it bounces back up everytime they sell. so yes, we will probably see it drop again and again, but it will rise again and again.

I dont know where that bank is from, but the high interest is probably linked to a high rate of inflation in that country. And could also be due to a high risk. for instance, Kenyans have a high interest on term deposits, but its because kenya had a rate of inflation of 6% roughly annually, making it less than what youd recieve off a 2% term deposit somewhere in canada or america.
@_date: 2017-12-12 04:05:44
yeaaaa so thats the reason for the high interest. :)
if youre getting 18% back, but losing 20% of value, your net gain is -2%. youre losing money still.
@_date: 2017-12-11 22:34:12
Couldnt tell you, i dont use coinbase.
@_date: 2018-09-27 17:31:58
yea that all seems unnecessary, the whole reason btc is even possibly because competing coins are allowed to exist, the competition of a currencies is a good thing imo.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:22:58
bitmex.com allows you to short bitcoin. also allows you to leverage it.
@_date: 2018-09-10 14:46:38
irrelevant, its value is derived from the value we give it. therefore fiat.
@_date: 2018-09-10 04:19:46
bitcoin is fiat.
@_date: 2018-08-15 06:48:17
100% here. I bought it as a hedge really, in case the economy crashed, not really to earn income on it.

But wouldn't the job of dispensing saved capital be able to be fulfilled by private brokers at that point since everyone will be storing their money in their digital wallets rather than at banks?
@_date: 2018-05-02 01:46:57
interest is different than capital gains. your only expecting 2-3% on interest for others investing your money, but investments are you investing, so youre expected 8-14% on a good year.
@_date: 2018-05-01 17:58:20
what i mean is, wont banks have no capital because people wont need to store their money in them. The banks might buy crypto with the dollars they have, but people wont give them their capital anymore to hold and invest because theyll be holding it themselves. and will only need to seek private brokers to invest their crypto

The average line would be pretty steady haha, but as it stands, seems as steady as an escalating earthquake.
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:13:34
have a stronk?
@_date: 2018-11-20 03:00:24
you never have losses if you dont realize them :)

I think the investments hes thinking of are the ones in which he will be able to bask in the shade of.
