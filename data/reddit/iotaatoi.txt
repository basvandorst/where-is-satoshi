There was actually zero premine in IOTA.

Why would they? IOTA is maximally decentralized, you don't even have centralization of power around miners as in blockchain, as has been pointed out by several researchers is a problem in Bitcoin, including Sergio Demian Lerner.

There is a ledger, no transactions get lost, but you don't need a static evolving entire blockchain to ensure this.

IOTA is the first tangle, where else was Tangle used in an equivalent manner before? And prove that Jute is not inspired by IOTA. IOTA was announced fall 2015, do you have predating docs? If not, sorry you have no credibility.

A premine implies that someone got these tokens before it was available for everyone else on fair grounds. IOTA is so far the *only* project where the founders, developers and researchers had *no premine allocated to themselves*. Even Satoshi instamined the hell out of Bitcoin if you want to 'split hairs'. IOTA tokens were 100% fairly distributed among the early supporters of the project. This infantile obsession of with this term they don't even understand is just sad, what difference does it make whether you acquire the tokens through having access to expensive hardware and cheap electricity or just flat out buying them? Spoiler alert: none.

A lot of what you say here is false: IOTA was announced on BitcoinTalk in October 2015, yes, but already in July elsewhere. The first whitepaper of IOTA was actually published in September 2015 as well, the April 2016 is just an updated version. Sergio Demian Lerner will readily admit this, and in October IOTA already had code, not just theory.
The core idea of using DAG was dicussed by the founders of IOTA back in 2014, which you would easily have known if you had read the IOTA whitepaper in full and checked the citations, it's citation number 3 (
So we have established that IOTA was undoubtedly one of the earliest to contemplate DAGs (2014) and first with code and whitepaper (Early fall 2015) and first with alpha (January 2016) and now got a functioning network with thousands of users and millions of transactions, yet you criticize it off hand without being able to point to anything concrete and refuse to acknowledge the project's pioneering status. That is simply unacceptable for anyone who wants to be taken seriously.

Uhm, this is false. It is completley trustless.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:54:58
Haha, you see a theoretical paper as the leader in the space? Not the 2 year project with a working implementation? You are truly a joke.
@_date: 2016-03-12 18:57:51
No, it gets pruned :)
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:45:07
It is, we use something called snapshotting in our pruning, meaning that all balances are kept
@_date: 2016-03-12 19:42:21
Did you read the whitepaper or just asking for a 'simple' explanation for a complex topic?

There is no secret that some of the guys involved in Nxt, which created the first 100% Proof of Stake blockchain, has also been involved in IOTA. So what? Nxt was inarguably one of the most inventive blockchain solutions that has since inspired tons of blockchain projects, including bitcoin ones. This is a compliment not a negative.

A lot of things exist in theory, it still takes a brilliant mind to actually create something that works in practice. Most of bitcoin also existed in theory long before Satoshi, so your whole argument is moot. I will not spend more time responding to you as it is clear you are a maximalist who does not care about reality, have fun with you 80 cent fees and 7 transactions per second.

Says the guy who copied their concept and refused to even give credit, you got zero academic integrity.

Bitcoin is hyper centralized around mining pools though. Why are Bitcoin maximalists so anti-innovation? Bitcoin served a great prototype role, just like Netscape did.
