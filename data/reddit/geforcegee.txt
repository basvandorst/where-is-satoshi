"Raising the blockade isn't the right solution."
Rendering a coin nearly unusable through volatility, pushing companies like Steam and Microsoft to abandon bitcoin while devs sit around and talk about solutions like segwit (which is opt in and is actually stagnating) and LN that was promised 6 months later in 2015. And that by design requires a blockchain resize.
Yeah, increasing the size of the blockchain isn't the right solution. It's not like Satoshi didn't plan for it or anything...
@_date: 2018-01-05 04:22:12
So has he publicly invested or are these mere words?
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:03:05
You don't rename a coin because copy cats throw their toys out the cot and fork.
It's Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:58:45
Really interesting. We can scale to visa transactions, now.
Not in 5 years.
@_date: 2018-01-29 03:53:19
Great things are happening with ethereum for sure. It remains to be seen if ethereum has what it takes to be considered the main crytpo. Lot of ground to cover before that happens.
@_date: 2018-01-29 00:57:42
That moment you realize you've actually been backing the wrong horse all along.
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:37:49
I wonder why?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:33:55
Then they don't know what they're talking about.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:25:29
To the best of my understanding, Bitcoin Cash sees itself as the true Satoshi intended "what Bitcoin should really have been."
After reading technical information, I'm actually starting to agree with them.
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:03:23
So here we are. 2018. Refusal to increase the block size means the fork between BTC and BCH is pretty clear. BTC is not the original vision and however many people attack me and even if I get banned, BCH is Bitcoin Legacy and BTC is the fork.
@_date: 2018-01-29 20:33:30
This is an extreme example of a strawman argument. I'm an advocate of BCH, not because I want to trick anybody. I'm an advocate of BCH because it doesn't rely on solutions like Segwit or LN and conforms to the original Bitcoin design.
BCH may have hard forked from BTC, but it can be argued BCH is actually what the original Bitcoin vision was. 
We don't need to attack each either either. We can hold different opinions without resorting to insults :)
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:52:57
That's not how any of this works.
You don't wave a magic wand and say, it happened. I don't need to prove it.
If it happened, finding the evidence would be a breeze. No one else needs to do your work for you. You made a claim, burden of evidence is on you. Nobody else.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:05:51
The point is, we were being promised LN in 6 months time back in 2015.
I'm hopeful we will have it by at least next year. Segwit may start making a dent, dependant on exchange adoption for sure.
In the meantime, BTC is not functioning like a currency.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:21:57
No, I don't. But if you don't know the technical reason (just like I don't know) how can either of us be sure what we're being told about lightning is true?
Remember this is something that was promised to be delivered over the next 6 months back in 2015. And we're now in 2018 and no eta.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:14:57
Yeah look, I'm probably coming across all doom and gloom. Not my intention. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:15:55
I for one would like you to provide the technical reason please. I'm being genuinely serious.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:16:37
You care so little, yet obviously have to reply because you care so much.
You're an idiot. That's an observation, not an insult.
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:34:43
My inference was the latter.
@_date: 2018-01-29 04:04:04
Yeah adoption is all that stands in the way tbh.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:11:54
Here are the facts.
Transactions are currently too expensive.
Transactions take too long.
From what ive read, Satoshi planned for progressive blockchain size increasements over time. If I'm wrong on this point sorry.
LN will require a blockchain size increase to function effectivly.
Bitcoin is not currently operating like a healthy currency.
Some decisions need to be made shortly or Bitcoins popularity will transition to another coin that can function as a currency. I'm not suggesting BCH fyi.
@_date: 2018-01-24 10:54:10
Its also on anybody that makes any claim.
"What can be claimed without evidence can be dismissed without evidence."
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:33:42
And this is how decentralization dies. To thunderous applause.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:37:49
Do you understand how it will do this?
@_date: 2018-01-10 17:41:01
2 years of not being able to use a currency as a currency.
Yeah, 2 years ain't sh... you're clearly looking at the big picture through fogged glasses.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:40:42
My understanding is Lightning will require larger blocks.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:46:41
And you missed the point entirely sorry.
The time for stagnation has ended. There is no other option open at this point in time if Bitcoin is to be used as a currency.
Segwit is stagnating.
No one has an ETA on LN.
Transaction fees are high.
Transaction times are long.
Companies are starting to not accept Bitcoin as it's so volatile.
You're kind of right it's an easy solution and a temporary fix. Can you tell me when segwit will have 20% adoption rate? When LN is going to be stable? Of course you can't. So here we are, unable to use the currency because no ones done anything.
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:14:22
While youre suggesting we "wait for segwit adoption," segwit adoption is stagnating.
We need a solution now. Not in 6 months.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:59:08
The brand name another coin copied.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:41:36
Well no. The point was, the size may end up being 2tb in 5 years if we were to say adopt 2mb. In 5 years 4tb drives will be commonplace in all machines. Including laptops.
What I'm trying to say is hardware specs passively increase over time. People put new hardware in for new nodes etc. If there was 6 months of warning, we're increasing the blockchain size to 2mb. Upgrade your hardware to match x increase over time if tou run a node. That wouldn't be an issue. Even in third world countries.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:25:12
That reasoning is not sound. We live in an age where anyone with a spare 1tb hdd in an Intel NUC can run a node. Yes the chain may take a while to download.
So here we are. Transactions are failing, fees are up and down. Bitcoin can't currently be used as a currency due to its volatility. Companies are no longer accepting it and you are worried about how hard it is for anyone to purchase a multi terabyte hard drive and run a personal node?
Is this seriously the reason? Because that is extremely unreasonable.
Edit: I proudly run a node on an Intel NUC. If the blockchain size was 5tb, I'd sort a machine with an 8tb hard drive. 10tb... 12tb... anything to help keep it decentralized.
Download size isn't the issue. 
Edit2: Skimmed through Bitfurys study on pros and cons of block size increase. Full of assumptions and actually sounds quite biased towards sidechain adaption instead of addressing the real issues.
@_date: 2018-01-29 21:08:36
And you're the perfect example of what you're accusing me of. Ad hominem attacks instead of addressing the points made.
I'm looking at the core argument (forgive the pun) here. On blockchain scaling. Bitcoin Core can't. Bitcoin Cash can. Bitcoin Core refuses to scale on chain even though it's been demonstrated numerous times it's doable on current home pc hardware. It is also forcing off block solutions.
At this point, BTC has deviated from the original design. Is attempting to tell you LN will solve all of your problems when in reality isn't ready for production deployment and by design will create centralization and complexity to a system that doesn't require it.
Those that listen to the nonsense you're spewing are the ones I pity.
Have a great day.
@_date: 2018-01-08 07:56:13
Ok. Do you have a technical understanding of why the fees will be lower?
@_date: 2018-01-10 18:05:03
Stop being a sheep.
No one realistically thinks one company will control LN. The point is, it's centralization if it's not truly decentralized.
@_date: 2018-01-25 08:18:21
Ok you can't provide sources for anything... so you're full of shit.
That's how this works.
@_date: 2018-01-08 08:35:04
Have an upvote. I 100% agree with you.
The main reason seems to stem from Bitfurys Study on blockchain size increase. Or at least from what I can see. 
I find this to contain a number of assumptions without providing any tangible evidence increasing the blocksize will affect decentralization, nor the number of nodes. After all, many of us would simply run our node on larger drives. Most modern computers have at least 2gb of RAM and a powerful enough processor to handle a simple 100gb-2tb database. Personally, I see this article as a way to push an agenda for sidechain adoption.
These are not my points, they are quoted from the linked PDF.
**In favor of an increased block size:**
• More transactions per second, faster confirmation time. Note that block confirmation time also
depends on mean block generation time (set to 10 minutes by the Bitcoin protocol). Thus, median
confirmation time can never drop below several minutes unless the block generation aspect of
the protocol is changed as well.
• More transactions for systems built on top of Bitcoin blockchain, such as colored coins platforms
(e.g., Counterparty, OmniLayer).
• Increasing block size would allow keeping low transaction fees
**Against a block size increase:**
• Increasing the block size would require a hard fork of the system, meaning newly solved blocks
won’t be recognized by non-upgraded software. This could lead to negative consequences for
Bitcoin pricing and reputation.
• Larger blocks may propagate slower through the network, which could lead to an elevated orphan
rate and increased probability of a successful double-spend. Because of poor bandwidth
between China and the rest of the world, European and American miners are at a disadvantage
compared to Chinese mining pools as long as the latter hold the majority of the mining power.
• Processing larger blocks requires more powerful hardware, which may cause a decrease in the
number of full nodes in the Bitcoin network. This could lead to centralization of the network
and a change of local and global peer-to-peer topology.
• Elevated hardware requirements and growing orphan rate could lead to unstable block generation
and inaccurate evaluation of the difficulty target for the network.
• The Bitcoin blockchain was not originally designed for all kinds of transactions; some transactions
are likely best handled with other technologies (such as sidechains and micropayment
• Higher fees resulting from keeping the block size limit low may help develop a transaction fees
market. This would help the Bitcoin ecosystem and encourage development of off-chain solutions.
• The Bitcoin blockchain should not be used for cheap permanent storage, as it is viable with big
blocks and low transaction fees.

Segwit adaption has stagnated. I'm trying to be a realist here. LN has no eta?
And the file sizes were a worst case example. No one will be running half their drive considering I'm advocating 2mb size before LN and segwit are adopted. So the blockchain starts to double in size. Either way, technology is outpacing its growth considering how cheap drives are right now.
@_date: 2018-01-03 16:56:51
Imitations. Never as good as the original.
@_date: 2018-01-08 09:01:52
I'd appreciate you not talking about my knickers. :p
In all seriousness though, I'm all for changes that improve BTC's use as a currency. As a nicehash miner, I'm just concerned.
@_date: 2018-01-03 17:00:25
It's the "New Hope" of coins. It's the original coin by which all other coins are measured.
