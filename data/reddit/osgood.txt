Do they require a certain type of wallet or will any work?

Greenaddress looked really nice. Honestly it looks about as slick as the PayPal app. 
The other one Mycelium seems pretty well trusted and seems very straightforward.

I just wanted to thank you all again. I wrote my post hastily on a five minute break. I'm amazed how far bitcion has come since hearing about it on 4chan when it was maybe two years old.

I also agree with this. I just asked that question on here. I liked a few of them though this is the most. It is stupid easy to use.

As for thed tax question I assume it depends where you live. In the US your gold sales are only recorded over a certain amount sold for tax reasons at the location sold. Though there are countries like Britain that only let you sell up to 5k pounds a year in gold frolm what I have read on their government site. Oddly enough bringing in specific types of gold is tax free. So it's a decent way to move buying power from a volatile medium to a much less volatile medium. As a way to get around paying a capitol gains tax, I'm not sure if the risk is worth the reward. That'll depend on how much your country watches transactions I assume. 
With that said  in no way do I advocate tax evasion. I'm only putting out the information I'm aware of. Ok covered my butt ha.
