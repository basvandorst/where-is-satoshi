from what i've experienced reading the trollbox, BTC-E is basically a bunch of 15yr olds day trading $50 worth of PPC, LTC, NMC etc and thinking they're Gordon Gecko

@_date: 2013-04-10 11:17:47
try omnicoins.com or localbitcoins.com  you want to probably set up an accnt with mtgox, but if you want your btc fast while your waiting for a bank transfer to gox try those 2 sites. their rates a bit shit but you'll get your coins very quickly. good luck mate. edit: sorry i didnt read the bit where you'd already set up a gox accnt. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 04:53:43
its pretty much impossible to tell but i think a good guess is somewhere between 10-20%
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:44:43
there are services out there set up for regular retail businesses to accept btc payments instantly. apparently they're similar to a debit/credit card terminal and have access to a dedicated node in the blockchain. i've seen a post here about it before but cant remember the name. but yeah, no one will be waiting 2 hours for a cup of coffee.

blockchain.info isnt a bad place to set up a secure wallet. fairly simple process actually. it also has its own free app for iPhone which seems to work pretty well in my experience. just be sure to set up the 2 step auth process on blockchain.info for extra security. best of luck

Blockchain.info isn't a bad place to start if you're new to btc and don't have too much stored in your wallet. Just be sure to enable 2FA on your account login and a 2nd password that's needed to withdraw/send funds. Be sure to download a backup of your wallet.dat file from them and keep it somewhere safe in case their site is ever compromised etc. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 06:22:09
I like to think of what we are in now with BTC, the way people used to think about the internet back when it was still finding its feet. the infrastructure, speeds, usefulness were all very limited. people didnt trust online retailing, banking etc. fast forward 10-15 years and its hard to see how we lived without it. BTC is similar in my opinion but its gots a long way to go and many hurdles to overcome before its considered a real alternative to mainstream currency...but i just cant help the feeling that we are in the beginning stages of something very very BIG here. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:02:48

I signed up with them a few weeks ago. It tool almost a week but got ID'd in the end. I think they're just a bit overwhelmed at the moment with an influx of new users. You could try and shoot them an email or something asking how your progress is going?

i started off in the market through a website called omnicoins.com . their rates arnt the best but you get your BTC in a few hours. your other alternative is to set up an accnt with MtGox.com but the verification process with them can take a while as i hear there is a big line of people waiting to get in on the action. good luck mate. 
@_date: 2013-03-28 04:05:29
dont invest what you cant afford to lose. this shit is still very volatile. if I was buying in now i'd be in it for the long run. i'd be very interested to know what percentage of the BTC market is purely speculating and how many people are actually using BTC. if a scare, fork, bad press etc come along the speculators will dump and run and the price will crash. be prepared for this.

@_date: 2013-11-29 02:03:21
no one knows how many have already been lost of stolen. there's really no way of knowing that with any certainty really. to answer the 2nd part of your question, a single bitcoin can be divisible to something like 100 million decimal places. Currently its only 8 decimal places but that can be updated in the protocol if its needed
@_date: 2013-04-19 03:14:36
probably not the best idea to openly state here that you're purchasing things from SR op. thats just my 2 satoshi anyways.

i was lucky in that i got verified with MtGox almost 2 months ago when the interest in bitcoin was low, prices were low compared to what they are now. only took about 4 days. if i was new to the market (in AU), i'd look at getting some coins through omnicoins.com. the rate isnt the best but at the rate BTC are increasing in value it might be worth your while cos by the time you get verified with mtgox, then wait another 5 days for your AU funds to reach your MtGox accnt, the BTC price will be higher than what you would have paid a smaller trader like omnicoins. just my advice based on experience. good luck.

mining bitcoins is now quite an involved and expensive task requiring purchasing specialised hardware that can cost thousands (+ electricity costs). If you just want literally a few pennies worth of bitcoins you might want to try visiting some bitcoin 'faucet' sites. google them. other than that, set up an accnt with a bitcoin exchange company and just buy some.
@_date: 2013-04-15 22:49:36
they probably just wont pay out on the order unless the buyer actually makes the deposit in the bank branch. similar set up to omnicoins.com
@_date: 2013-04-18 06:35:45
6 does seem a bit high. i think mtgox needs about 7 or 8 before they clear your btc into your account. i know btc-e.com only requires 3, and a few of the btc gambling sites i've tried only need 1. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 01:29:12
Blockchain.info isn't bad as long as your main password is strong, 2FA enabled and you set a 2nd password that needed to withdraw your btc.

i started off with omnicoins.com for mine while i was waiting for Mt Gox to verify my account. but yeah, localbitcoins.com is also a really good way to buy them. rates probably arnt the best tho.

totally understand where you're coming from. fact is btc is still a very small market in its early days, with an even smaller market in Australia. i think its quite safe to say that in the near future we will see a number of exchanges opening up that will accomodate the aussie markt, wether they are based in aus or os.
@_date: 2013-04-08 22:37:35
you could try bitfloor or btc-e? 
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:03:48
thats a risk that they take. you'll notice that their price is somewhere between 5-10% more than say, the going AUD-BTC rate on MtGox, which should cover them incase the rate increases. compared to a week or 2 ago, the price has been fairly stable through the day.

fellow aussie here. I purchased my first bitcoins through a website called omnicoins.com. you give them your wallet, physically go to one of the 4 big banks, deposit some $$$ into their account and you'll have your coins within a few hours. check them out. you can also try localbitcoins.com to find people in your area willing to sell them. if you want the best rates though you'll have to set up an account with mtgox.com. they're one of the few that will let you exchange aus $$ for btc. getting verified with them will take a couple of weeks though so, if i was you, i would go through omni or localbitcoins.com. best of luck mate! edit: dont worry. if you buy in now, you're still an early adopter. this babys got a long way to go yet.

you can send bitcoins to anyone, anywhere, anytime, basically for free or a very low (if any) transaction fee (see if your bank will do that for you), as long as they have a bitcoin address or wallet of course which is extremely easy to set up and free.

blockchain.info is for creating a wallet, amoung other things. you cant buy btc there (not where im from anyway) you'll need to start an account with a btc exchange like mtgox or bitfloor if you want to purchase bitcoins themselves. or you could try localbitcoins.com . re the amt to start, basically thats relative to how much you can afford to lose initially. this is a risky game with very volitile prices. be careful. best of luck.

transfers to Gox accnts are taking longer than normal latley. they do require about 9 or 10 confirmations on the network before clearing funds. you can run a search on your Gox wallet here to see if things are in motion at least. 
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:39:14
Block chain is not where you go to purchase bitcoins. You need to go through an exchange like mtgox, btc-e, bitfloor, bitinstant etc. the blockchain is where you can go to create a wallet, check on the overall performance, statistics of the network  etc. you could also try localbitcoins.com to purchase Bitcoin. Good luck :)

The fluctuations will die down over time as the market becomes larger and more mature. The guys that hold large amounts will decrease and the effect they have on the market when they cash out will decrease. Bitcoin is still in its infancy and during periods of mass media attention its price goes crazy. If you look at its price over time since inception you'll notice very long periods of time where the price stayed very stable (say the 12 months prior to April this year)

The short answer is no. Its basically impossible to determine a bitcoin wallet's private key by knowing the public key/address. This of it as if it was email; If I know your email address it doesn't mean i can hack or access your email account, your email password is your private key.

The current processing/hashing power of the entire blockchain is something like 500x more powerful than the top 100 supercomputers in the world combined. I don't know the exact figures but its huge.

I think it just makes it easier and seem somewhat more affordable. People are used to equating "1 xCoin" with some cheap or low level value i.e 1 US dollar or 1 euro etc. What a lot of Joe public still don't realise is that 1btc is acutally made up of 100million units and goes to 8 decimal places

if they gave them out to everyone at once how would you control who gets them and who doesnt, how much each etc??? the purpose of mining them is that people have to spend capital, resources and time to get them, and over time they become harder to to get and thus worth more...sounds like another shiny little rock doesn't it ;)

The miners are currently rewarded when they solve each algorithm thats used to create bitcoins but they also get revenue by confirming transactions in the blockchain. Thats where the small transaction fees come in. The idea is that by the time the last bitcoins are mined then the network will mainly be used for actual transactions and therefore mining is still profitable.

the total amount of btc to ever be produced is capped at 21 million. not sure where you got 21 billion from. 
@_date: 2013-04-08 05:13:55
i imagine they'd have some sort of averaging system in place. plus im pretty sure as soon as a product is sold in BTC they cash that bitch out into fiat asap..and maybe keep a little btc for the future ;)
@_date: 2013-11-28 13:18:24
if you're going to use blockchain.info just make sure you have a strong password &amp; enable 2FA on login and have a 2nd password setup for when you want to make withdraws. It auto populates the identifier through a cookie i would imagine but not 100% sure. also keep a copy of your updated wallet file somewhere safe at all times
@_date: 2013-04-07 03:47:11
Bitcoinity.org/markets is by far the best site for this

you could try   mate. fellow aussie here. i dont have an accnt with them (im with mtgox) but thinking of starting one up. im only with gox cos i got in ages ago and gox was pretty much the only option for AUD - BTC trading. best of luck.

i think you just need to work out in your own head what your goals are OP. quick buck? long haul? or be an active part of the btc economy? once you figure that out you'll be much better and less addicted to the charts. i know it worked for me. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:53:45
Its still very early days and new exchanges and start-ups are coming. It takes time. Gox's infrastructure is much better than it was earlier this year. Their shitty infrastructure at the time was one of the reasons for the April crash. They just couldn't keep up with the massive increase in demand for btc trading
@_date: 2013-04-09 01:32:05
people are investing in btc as a means of storing and transfering wealth quickly, easily and anonymously. i think most people are in it purely for speculation purposes though.

The most needed application now is a product that makes it easy to store and spend your bitcoins whilst maintaining a virtually unhackable level of security = peace of mind for the end user = more people using bitcoin. Products like this:

Couple of options. 1) if you already have an accnt with Mt Gox you can use the 'redeem private key' option to get your mBTC from your brain wallet into your accnt. 2) set up an accnt with blockchain.info and import your private key that way. 3) not 100% sure on this, but if you download the Bitcoin-qt client you can import your private key that way and spend your btc.    I'd suggest having 2 bitcoin wallets, one as a brain wallet that is offline and think of that as your 'savings'. You can send btc to it and monitor it without it ever having touched the internet. Set up another wallet on say blockchain.info and use that as 'spendings', day-to-day transactions (don't keep too much in there) and make sure you have 2FA enabled, a strong main password and 2nd password required to withdraw/spend bitcoin. 
@_date: 2013-04-06 09:56:34
yeah i noticed that too. over the last few days BTC-E have been trading bitcoin at, on average, about $10 cheaper than Gox. there has to be a catch somewhere.

there are plenty of other popular exchanges out there:
^these are just a few. Gox has just been around the longest i think which is why it has the majority share.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:44:00
people invest in bitcoin because they are losing faith in the banking sector and financial regulators. if a big, established bank got involved it would defeat the purpose of why a lot of people are stashing their money in btc. problem is, that if a new 'btc bank' popped up, no one would trust them to secure their wallets etc. just my thoughts, but something definitely worth discussing.

MtGox is one of the largest, if not, the largest Bitcoin exchange companies in the world. They are one of the few that will exchange AUD also. You can set up an account with them for free but you have to send them proof of ID before they let you transfer money from your au bank accnt to your trading accnt with them. Thats called verification. because bitcoin is going ganbusters atm there is a que of about 6000 people waiting to be verified with Mtgox. that might take weeks for them to clear

Paul Krugman? wasnt that the guy that stated that the internet would have no more effect on the worlds economy than fax machines?
@_date: 2013-03-28 00:14:18
I started in the AUD market through a mob called omnicoins.com. Their rate isn't the best but you'll get your bitcoins same day no questions asked. I'm with mtgox now where the rates are better but if you go with them expect to be waiting several weeks to get verified. If u don't have a wallet yet u can get one free and instantly on instawallet. Use it as a temporary wallet until u get the Bitcoin client installed on your pc
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:21:17
Every **transaction** is trackable by viewing the blockchain. This issue is how would you know what a dormant bitcoin is? There is no way to tell the difference between bitcoins sitting in a wallet where the owner has stashed the private key safely away or whether the owner has lost or destroyed the key.

try to think of it like where we were when credit cards first came out, or the Internet itself. society was very unsure and untrusting of them and it took quite a while for people to understand and come on board. look where they are now! i see the same thing happening with btc and other cryptos.

definitely speculators. many have no idea what they're doing and are trying to make a quick buck. that and some financial issues in the EU where people are starting to really distrust the financial sector and central EU bank. bit of a perfect storm of shit really thats causing a lot of people to throw large amounts of money at something they dont fully understand.

wouldnt that also effect electronic fiat transactions as well?

OP clearly wasn't here in April...
@_date: 2013-11-29 02:35:17
exactly. the protocol of bitcoin is designed so that the more people there are mining the more difficult it is to 'win' a block. If people decide that mining is no longer profitable and stop mining the btc protocol reduces the difficulty in relation to how many miners, or combined processing power, remains. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:16:34
yes, you should be able to do that. sorry, i misread your question before.

@_date: 2013-12-04 02:52:17
You could sell at Gox's higher prices but it takes weeks (sometimes months) for them to send you your $$$. + Gox will charge you commissions etc which will eat up the "profit" pretty quick. Trust me, if it was easy and profitable to arbitrage bitcoins everyone would do it.

@_date: 2013-04-06 03:00:30
i created a wallet at  for free and pretty quick. they dont store your password on their servers and the security seems pretty tight. you dont have to wait for your client to sync with the whole chain before you can access it. thats where my btc is anyway. best of luck mate. 
@_date: 2013-12-03 05:24:38
I would recommend going to blockchain.info and setting up a wallet there. Its free and should only take a couple of mins. Just make sure you set a strong password, enable 2FA and have a 2nd password for when you want to send the bitcoins from your wallet. 
@_date: 2013-04-09 02:51:43
set up your own wallet on blockchain.info, back it up etc (instructions are on the site) in mtgox you need to go to "Withdraw Funds" i think its under "funding", select Bitcoin from the options and copy and paste your new blockchain.info wallet into where gox asks you for a wallet to transfer to. hope this helps. best of luck.
@_date: 2013-04-09 03:30:07
i've thought about that. i think there are people all over the world scrambling to start up btc exchanges as fast as they can. i dont blame them. also, i think btc-e.com allows you to transfer your Rubles directly into btc and trade on them. 
@_date: 2013-04-04 03:08:01
apparently theres already companies offering POS terminals that work specifically for Bitcoin at retail traditional outlets. someone mentioned it the other day here. apparently its quite simple and cost effective to set up and run for the merchant.

this thread from earlier today might have some good reading in it for you:
@_date: 2013-04-10 04:04:46
don't worry. that very issue you mentioned is a major one the community is dealing with now. btc needs to stabilize soon so it can start be used as it was originally intended. still early days, and the more merchants come on board and as the xchange rate slows, the more likely people will start actually spending them

China happened
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:57:27
good idea. It is possible on blockchain.info to 'import a wallet' by uploading the private key where by that would expose your wallet details to the internet. But you don't need to do that if you just want to view your wallet's current balance by entering in the address to blockchain.info
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:10:30
blockchain.info is probably your best bet. just make sure you have a strong password and enable 2FA. Make sure you keep a safe back up of your wallet file it sends you just incase anything ever happened to the website.
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:39:59
