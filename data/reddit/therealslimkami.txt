As long as this type of “people” are on board I’m not buying back in.

Not really.
Stories like these are keeping people away from bitcoin.
If bitcoin wants to become big it needs the “normal” people who don’t understand the technical background.
As long as you can lose all your money just by losing a flashdrive or just making a typo in a transaction people will stay away from it with big investments

If you own all BTC, so ~21M of it and it’s worth 0,01 USD you have:
210.000 USD
So just one guy could by half a house with all the existing BTC.
You are right, the  retardness is heavily increasing...
