 Like I said on the last post: I'm sorry for the way FrozenBit's PR team handeled early relations. I can assure you will not see that type of immaturity from our team again. Thank you for standing by as this is a learning experience for our team and the community. I hope you'll signup for the beta and help test the platform.

 Thank you for your concern about how early advertising took place. I can assure you, those mistakes will not happen again. Our team is restructed and matured. We're strongly rooted in the multisignature community, and we've since ammended with greenaddress and support their continuing advancements. -Calvin

Thanks for the excelent question. The multisig is all done via in browser, via word seeds. We DO have an opensource package aswell, so why not check it out on github? 
 We aren't just doing multisig either, we have things like watch only mode, proof of reserves (public auditing tools), escrow types and even a referral program where you can earn free bitcoin!
 We are currently supporting black coin, quark, litecoin, doge and bitcoin!

Sorry about the slow reply, the 10min limit got me. Exactly as said above, we are a decentralized trustless platform we have nothing to do with your wallet. YOU generate and control every key for your wallet. Again verify with our github.
