They are a ponzi so don't deposit anyway. When they run out of fools they need a good excuse like a hack to shut down with the users money.

I like this much better than a hard cap of 20mb. This has the potential to be the only fork needed with regards to the block size.
@_date: 2014-12-19 17:17:57
That's only half true

Why are you so sure they are cashing out all of it?

He should be careful with daytrading if he wants to keep that full bitcoin

You can't force a fee like this, it's not in the interest of traders nor exchanges. Higher market cap is the only thing that will reduce volatility.

I just wrote it with pen and paper as a copy

Good to hear :)
It's fine to play with small amount for trading, but it's very risky as I'm sure you know. Hope you manage to earn some more though

You can just hash a bunch of hashes to group them. Transaction fees should prevent spamming.

If you think it won't go lower then buy now, otherwise buy over time to get a more average price.

This is awesome, their terminals are almost everywhere in my country :)
@_date: 2015-01-22 21:33:15
It is.

According to this thread yesterday it's ISP

I'm very skeptical to it's protein and fat contents. As far as I know rice protein does not contain all essential amino acids. And olive oil, even though it has omega-3s still has a lot more omega-6 content, which competes in the body for the same enzymes.
You can probably use it as a meal replacement just fine but be sure to get some good fat fish inbetween those.

Why would they care about a voice recorder anyway? It's not like you can't do that with any phone

Hopefully this gets popular so we see more of these type of games :)

No but it looks like these claim to have fixed the issue
I think only viable option is to use whey for proteins and fish oil for fats to be honest.

Metallaxis got it, here you go if you hurry :)

She was unengaging, negative and acted almost as if she didn't want to hear about the interview subject. Very unprofessional and quite rude.
@_date: 2015-01-08 21:08:06
Yeah only for iOS 8.1
@_date: 2015-05-18 22:18:03
I'm not sure how they're planning to make this work but they have my attention! :)

Love that it's being implemented already. Thanks man

Gotta spend money to ~~make~~ scam money
@_date: 2015-04-09 12:07:09
The altcoins BitShares (BitUSD) and NuShares (NuBits) have a solution for this. Hopefully it will be possible to do this directly on the blockchain but I'm not sure how that would work.

Getting involved with a known scam, great business strategy Cryptsy.

Read about it on something awful forums in 2010 but that was pretty much like reading buttcoin 1.0
@_date: 2015-04-11 11:15:08
Is it open source?
