Yeah, I've never talked to this person before... You seeem to know your shit; how was it possible?

I'll make a deal with you; I will pm you my IP, but you need to agree not to post it. If you have any luck fucking my internet life up, I will praise you and give you all sort of crypto-currency.

Haha I knew I would be kicking myself in the ass for that "uncrackable" declarement.  Care to expand on:


Edit: I was just trolling/talking shit in a sub with a total stranger(my situation)

The *search pots* method made the most sense to me on how this individual got my ip. I usually just troll/talk shit on reddit when I'm drunk, so I can not rule out  if I searched anything in the replies. What I don't understand; is how can a person(who doesn't own the website) see the traffic/ip info of the visitors?

I don't use the same name, or anything similar to each of my other accounts beyond reddit. I also have not linked an email to this account, so, my password can not be retrieved. Speaking of passwords -it's pretty much uncrackable. So ELI5, how my ip was detetected from a board. I can see if reddit was a chat client and a packet sniffer was used...

Some redditor got my ip address a few weeks ago. Not sure how s/he did it, because I didn't click any outside links. It was reported to the mods and then to the admins and ultimately dealt with. Still scratching my head on how it was done.

That was incredibly informative. Thank you.
