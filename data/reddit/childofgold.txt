Yeah I saw that but what does buy insolvency at 5 millibit mean.... Meaning is it a 1:1 where if you bet 5 you win 5 back?

Did you get my PM?

All Coinbase.

To live for people other than myself.  That by helping others you will get more back (not necessarily monetarily) than by being selfish and inwardly focused.

Right. What I'm seeing with either bitcointaxes and libratax is just REALIZED gains. If I bought in at $120, $360, $410, $800, $370 etc etc it doesn't tell me whether my "portfolio" is up or down. Coinbase Snapshot was great for this but no longer works

That's not shorting, that's just trying to sell high and buy low...
@_date: 2014-02-16 01:21:06
Except the upside of shorting is that you can make money IF bitcoin goes down. Then make more money by buying low like you are saying. I'm not saying that he should or shouldn't short BTC now, but there is a fundamental difference between buying low and shorting.

Charles Schwab refunds ALL ATM fees. Even internationally, any ATM's are free to use. No foreign transaction fees. Best bank/brokerage.

I'm more than happy to take a bet on Gox blowing up--problem is simply finding a credible place to do so.

Sent, thanks!
@_date: 2014-08-15 15:45:48
thanks, I just reached out to them!
@_date: 2014-02-22 20:55:12
Thanks for this. Unfortunately, they are set to just essentially as an exchange and not a sportsbook. I'm looking for somewhere where you can just bet against the house, right away, without having to wait for someone to match your bet
@_date: 2014-02-18 03:08:51
What do these credits get me, if anything?
@_date: 2014-05-20 14:46:06
No other replies?? This is for a very good cause. C'mon BTC community!!
@_date: 2014-10-16 18:31:45
The best!!
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:19:03
Booo all im gonna get is some credits from that website..

@_date: 2014-02-26 01:39:45
Exactly, then there is no point to this post.

@_date: 2014-02-18 01:30:56
Do you know any? I mean I know Intrade.com used to be the spot for these type of things and I doubt any sportsbooks have this...
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:06:46
Yeah I had confirmed the withdrawal actually on the night of the 25th--clicking on the confirmation link in the email that they sent me
@_date: 2015-02-21 12:35:39
You can apparently either sell all or none of your GoxBTC (can't just sell a portion). Is selling at .11 the smart move? Not too sure what I should do or what this public information is..
@_date: 2017-07-31 15:06:07
Yeah I had confirmed it actually on the night of the 25th. As in clicked the link in their email to go ahead with processing it..
