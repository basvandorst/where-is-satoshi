Well sure but the trouble is, how do you know when to buy low and sell high?
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:18:00
Are you actually that dumb? How uninformed are you?
You seriously don't know that Trump keeps calling successful people/companies "failing"?
I'm still waiting for your explanation on how I failed so badly. But of course I'm not actually waiting because I knew exactly you wouldn't answer because it's just something you heard your buddy Trump saying so you repeated it. 
And can you explain to me what the point is of saying it's a good thing when the currency tanks when most people lost money, just because it's good for the currency itself, when you know exactly that most people don't give a shit about the current but are in it to make some quick bucks?
I mean do you actually understand how moronic your arguments are?
And I love the old "looks I don't have time to argue" argument when you realize you lost and have nothing to say because you're wrong. Classic 5 year old behavior.
@_date: 2018-01-18 21:02:06
That's like saying South Africa or Australia are just small countries and yet when they stop mining diamonds the price skyrockets. Well no shit since half the market is concentrated in these two countries.
America only has 10% of the crypto market. Korea may have even more than America, they are huge in crypto, same as Japan.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:37:54
Lol, I invested $50 after 6k, so much for that. I couldn't give two shits about it.
There is certainly nothing good about the value dropping by 70% for half the people who invested in it.
Arguing about the bigger picture is completely moronic I'm the world of crypto currency, the most volatile market there is. People aren't in it for long term investment, even if you keep telling yourself that.
@_date: 2018-01-18 23:42:20
Up 17%. After dropping 60%
I mean, I suppose you can say +17% is an indicator for a healthy asset, when you ignore the fact that it just dropped %60. SMH.
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:44:54
I applaud your attitude. I still cry over not having cashed out when I was up 1k. All gone now.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:43:57
Aww the 5 year old stopped replying because he realized he lost. How predictable. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:54:27
Says the 5 year old who stops talking when he runs out of arguments because he knows he's wrong. Child.
@_date: 2018-01-16 12:04:14
It's ironic that you talk like Trump, it says everything about you. And you are telling me to get some class. Are for real?
I'm expecting your explanation now on how I "failed so badly" after I just told you I invested $50 after 6k.
Explain that to me. I'm waiting. I am up 1k btw.
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:20:36
How the fuck are "we" good? Are you actually incapable of understanding that more than half of the people bought after 6k?
Like, do you actually not understand that? Or do you choose to be ignorant?
@_date: 2018-01-15 21:03:40
Of course.
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:59:19
Gotcha, thanks
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:26:29
I'm just seeing it's just $150 now or $300 at the height of BTC.
Could be worse.
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:25:10
I fail to grasp the concept of a global currency? I think you fail to grasp the concept of money. How in the world does it matter where something is localized, that's completely irrelevant to what happened yesterday or to crypto in general. The issue is that Korea as in Koreans happen to have invested a lot into it. It's completely irrelevant where it's located. If the whole country suddenly gets excluded from the market a huge part of the demand is gone and they all sell. They hold a big portion of it, doesn't matter where it's located, 
@_date: 2018-01-22 02:52:12
Duuuude. You're a legend. I'd just about kill myself. 
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:58:04
Except that is why people are in it! And that's why you sound like a morning. Because you don't understand that people don't give a flying fuck about the point of crypto. Most people have no clue what these coins all do. They do this because they want to be in on the next big money maker. But suit yourself, think what you want.
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:55:04
Holy shit. Exactly how much do you hate yourself right now?
@_date: 2018-01-22 01:55:34
Medium lol.
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:30:55
It's not insane to invest so much money in it that you'd want to kill yourself when you lose it?
Okay. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:41:28
Well yes that's how the market works, but that still doesn't explain why it should drop on Sunday. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:13:42
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:12:36
Do you understand the concept of going up 7k and then going down 2k? This is what humans call a dip. Just because you choose to ignore  a dip and look at the total result doesn't make it go away.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:17:01
Wait. Did you just tell us you believe there is a difference between investing and gambling?
@_date: 2017-12-09 12:08:42
I'm not expecting it to rise at all. I am new to this and looking at the situation I decided holding off buying until I know what happens on Sunday.
"People think it's going to crash on Sunday because the futures market is opening on Wall Street"... Again, my question is why ;), sorry to be annoying.
It just doesn't make sense to me.
I don't know anything about this stuff so I'm just waiting to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-12-09 22:50:37
This would be a horror scenario. A currency with absolutely no justification of its value as the world currency. We'd be literally jumping from one financial crisis into the next on a monthly basis.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:17:55
Insane amounts of money. Right.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:29:19
So how much are we talking.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:28:54
Are you actually that stupid? No offense. I see these people talk like that on YouTube too. "Ohh it's still up so much, why u panicking uhh I no understand".
Is it really that difficult to comprehend that there are people who haven't been in Bitcoin at a point where they would still be in the positive range now? 
By your logic the stock market is a fucking free for all and you can't lose. Oh wait, not every stock holder bought everything when it was worth nothing.
And I didn't even lose money. But people like you piss me off. You either really are dumb or you are intentionally ignorant trying to rile up people who lost money.
@_date: 2017-12-09 04:45:12
But why should it drop at all is what I don't get? I thought if anything it would go up because it's becoming more interesting for traders?
I don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:35:11
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:38:52
Dude, I did. You're a legend. Fuckin A!
But I only for 50 bucks. How much did you put in?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:35:53
I understand that it logically would drop after spiking like this. What I don't understand is what the futures have to do with that. That's what confuses me. Everyone seems to say the futures thing will correct it. Why?! I just don't get that. I want to hear one reason for why the opening of features should reduce the value. I just want to understand it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:25:31
I never heard of Litecoin, what makes you think this is the one?
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:53:14
I just don't get why synonymously the opinion seems to be that it's going to correct on Sunday. I simply don't understand the thinking behind that, not even remotely. I understand the value is based on supply and demand. Mensing it goes down if people sell. Why would people start selling when basically a new market opens, making it more popular?
Wouldn't that be a time to buy? I just don't get it.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:07:38
I just want to know how you all pull these completely random statements out of you asses. How in the world would you know? Why even comment that?
Literally anything can happen, there is no way to know anything, everybody says the complete opposite of everybody else. None of us know.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:29:14
Can you explain to me what this correction is? I don't know anything about these things. I just keep reading everywhere that because of what's going to happen on Sunday supposedly there will be a "correction".
@_date: 2017-12-09 06:22:57
This guy knows.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:20:49
How much money would any sane person invest in this stuff?
What kind of people are that, wtf.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:34:27
I just transferred s low amount of money, I'm new to this. But I am not going to buy now. I would find that strange. It's been falling for the past 48h and everyone keeps saying it will get corrected on Sunday. Well, not everyone, but most people. That sounds way too risky to me. I'll wait until Sunday. Reading what everyone says makes me think it won't go up but if anything go down or stay.
So I don't see a point in buying now. But I'm just a noob. This is just what I gather from reading other people's opinions here and in the news.
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:31:31
Does seriously nobody here understand that many people haven't been in it for long enough? Just like all these posts about."don't stress overlay it's still 80% up last month". Jesus fucking Christ, it doesnt help me how much it is up since last month wenn I got in two weeks ago.
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:27:21
My concern is just what happens after the dip. Or rather, what doesn't.
I wonder if after the dip the hype will still be there. If it's ever going to rise again or if people will just forget about it. I suppose it won't hurt to invest at that stage because it probably might not drop again right away. But I wonder if there is anything left to gain after that.
@_date: 2017-12-09 11:54:02
It's not about bragging, I'm just curious what one makes when having invested in 2012
@_date: 2017-12-09 03:30:37
At least you can buy. It fucking tells me it won't let me buy for 7 days until they verify my sale. It also doesn't let me upload any ID to be able to add a bank account. Coinbase is fucking garbage.
@_date: 2017-12-09 10:08:56
This is what you call triggered? When someone asks where you have your unfounded opinion from? You're pretty weird.
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:11:49
Hahaha. 11h later, 50% lost. What's your take on this now?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:58:15
Jesus Christ why would you buy at this price.
I'm sorry for you. I only lost 80 for now. Still makes me sick.
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:38:03
No shit :D. "Something ticks it up", yes, WHAT! That is the question.
@_date: 2019-05-21 11:02:35
This is so utterly pathetic, it's almost as insane as people believing a 1%er billionaire wants to drain the swamp. A child giving a talk to adults on money. And there are people who listen! But then again there are people who believe Trump cares about them. 
Some people are just downright dumb, there is really no other way to put it.
