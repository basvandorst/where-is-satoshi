British Bank Bullshit does not only relate to Bitcoin. I had number of stupid incidents with their banks, which never happened to me either in Poland or Germany.
For instance, I was denied Savings Account due to lack of "Credit Score" on a UK address, even though I all my savings were waiting to be paid onto that account and I am employed until now.
I was denied information about the requirements for opening an offshore business bank account. They've said: "You can't have an account with us, Sir" and denied to share any more information about that.

That's not entirely correct.. Inflation encourages people to spend and not to save. This could be productive, but also could be spending on consumption which doesn't bring much productivity.  


The argument you can hear a lot. People saying that inflation is good, because if there is no inflation, then we have deflation, which is bad. What a brainwashing here we have. 
In fact, deflation isn't inherently bad. It's just doesn't work today with the current Keynesian economic model built on debt and spending.

That's a good question. I am not an economist. I am just an observer who can notice that current model is unsustainable for both society and planet in the long-term.
I need to admit I haven't studied the Keynesian model in detail, perhaps the problem is not with the Keynesian model, but how current governments radically pump money to grow the economy. There is a certain growth / productivity limit you can't address with more money on the market.   
If there is slight deflation (or simply no inflation or no deflation), yes perhaps there would be less incentive to invest your money, but there is still lots of stuff/services you need to buy (house, car, phone etc.). This money would go to businesses which is where the productivity / growth come from. Yes you wouldn't maybe spend that much money on luxury goods, but did you really wanted them in first place or perhaps you've wanted to buy them, since your money rotten due to inflation anyway? No inflation means reasonable spendings. Businesses around would have to adjust to "sell" stuff that's actually needed, the economy would still be there. 
Finally if the real inflation rate is reasonable then we also wouldn't have that radical assets prices bubbles when people hoard money. The official inflation rate is by no means real. The problem is mostly that our politics can't make a sensible use of Keynesian model.

Is over-consumption, pollution and constant run for growth, debt, more revenue, "profits grow toooo slooow" kind of thing good for society? I would prefer to live in a stabilized world, where there is no need to run, grow constantly, looking for a ways to preserve your wealth. Currency? No, because of inflation. Properties? No, because government can seize it or its value is speculative because everyone is trying to run away from currency. Bitcoin-like money is way more sound and eco-friendly (despite the energy spend for mining).

Relational databases were invented way before scalability issues arised. It's not SUPER impressive tech(still good tech), all it is, is a binary storage which uses SQL to query data. We have been using relation databases in developing software for 40+ years - the interesting part is the replication which is often solution to scalability issues.
TL;DR - Relational databases are the base for the ancient and modern software. Yes they wouldn't be as mature, if not the software which enforced the technology progress. 
Same story for Bitcoin, let's not exclude blockchain importance.

Bitcoin is a product based on on blockchain.
@_date: 2018-06-08 11:10:05
Both are great inventions. There would be no Bitcoin without blockchain, same as there would be no blockchain without Bitcoin.
Bitcoin uses blockchain to achieve financial decentralization. Blockchain itself can be used as a decentralized notary, signing public information or signing private information in a way that public can check it.
EDIT: Re: It sounds like most of you follow the hype. First everything around blockchain was cool, now everything anti block-chain is cool. Andreas made good points about the differences and inter dependencies.
I think the point he makes is that people undervalue Bitcoin and exaggerate blockchain importance...

If money supply can be increased, what's wrong with money supply being decreased (aka money destroyed)?
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:32:19
Shrinking money supply in modern Keynesian economy would mean the deflationary spiral, which would likely to be unhealthy.
My point was that if the money supplier is lowered, goods value stay the same, except they would cost less in nominal terms. Similarly as when the money supply is increased there is an inflation.  
In both cases the economy is not expanding/shrinking, in the long-term the psychology of either investing or stashing money might affect that, but in the short term money supply is not immediately affecting the economy size.
@_date: 2019-08-02 19:28:36


Thanks for pointing that out. I need to learn a lot. So given the ECB example, there are deposit rates which is minus 0,40% and there is a lending rate of: 0.25%.  
...so in other words there is a penalty for keeping deposits at central bank. The lending still costs a penny though.

And the consequence of borrowing money is that it needs to be paid back. Governments issue bonds that central bank buys  that's way of borrowing money, but when the governments needs to pay they debt (buy the bonds back) they normally wouldn't be able to... so they're issuing new bonds for even bigger money.

You took it all to the next mental stage. I am talking about simple principals (debt in principal shall be paid back etc.), whilst you already assume that debt is incorporated into Fiat money. 
Governments create money by taking on debt, so does the private banks while lending money. The difference is that government will never pay it back. That money is simply placed in the inefficient system of public services. If there is corruption that money is in some percentage washed and given to wealthy politicians. 
We live in a ridiculous world where some private banks needs to pay less to the central bank than it was borrowed, so actually the more money the borrow, the less they need to pay back in absolute measures.

I am new to investing, so my big picture is probably limited. Regulation is sensitive topic, especially if we talk about product where its main idea is decentralization, indisputable ledger. It's not an investment product like stocks might be.
In an ideal world it should be the exchanges to implement such a mechanisms in their own will... and I am not sure why it's not the case, but it should be in their best interest to protect crypto-world, from negative news, movements, fear, so more people (more trades/volumes) would come in. I am not convinced either way. I like freedom, I've invested, I am at loss now, but I am not panicking nor asking for regulations. I've made informed decision. I am the one to blame if I panic sell, but I don't plan anytime soon.

What? $2 for adding an offer? With current Bitsquare's market liquidity you might wait days before someone uses your offer, so you might need to adjust your offer, then you need to pay another $2?
Even if you're lucky enough and mange to close your offer. The $2 is already 2% if it was a $100 deal, or 0.2% if it was a $1000 deal. 
Either I don't understand it or its pricing model is bad.
