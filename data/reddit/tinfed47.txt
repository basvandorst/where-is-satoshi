Accountant here. By default that's most likely going to be a taxable event for countries with no other specific tax ruling on btc. However, in Australia you can use btc to purchase things under 10k AUD and it will be exempt for capital gains tax. If you want to buy a lambo with btc and need a qualified accountant let me know ;)

Hodlr here. It seems blockchain tech in its current form is too energy inefficient to use for microtransactions. Recording the same micro transaction on thousands of nodes is obviously more energy intensive than visa transactions.

I have a query. And it's not a troll. the point of bitcoin is supposed to be that it is easily accessible by everyone. Without the need for a bank or financial institution. How will the approval of an ETF attract additional investment? Surely big institutions can buy bitcoin too, or is it currently illegal for them to do so?

I'm a noob r/bitcoin only subscriber and I never looked at r/btc until recently. However I did recently listen to a two hour YouTube debate with Roger ver vs a segwit proponent. In my opinion Roger did have a persuasive argument for BU. He's focused on an immediate fix and believes segwit will not be an immediate fix (keeping in mind I'm not technical enough to assess that statement). On the other hand I do totally see how consolidating power into the hands of miners not being a good thing. Roger's argument is that Btc use (actually buying things with btc, not just holding) is what drives the underlying value of btc. 
@_date: 2017-03-13 23:22:51
Many altcoins can store value like gold but in the end they don't hold much because they are not widely adopted. Rogers strategy is focused on quick widescale adoption capitalising on the first mover advantage of btc so it won't get a chance to be replaced by other alt coins. In the YouTube video Roger raised the point that lightning node is something in the works and not an immediate fix. Again not sure how accurate that is... He could be full of crap.. but he definitely had more persuasive arguments than the segwit guys.

 - it's easy to say a crash is always looming because you're right. Correctly making a time bound prediction is a different story. If you know when it will happen you could make a shit ton of money by shorting bitcoin.

Because it's the law. Being a third party doesn't change that. If that isn't enough for you then don't forget that all btc transactions are permanently recorded in the blockchain forever. So maybe in two, four or eight years time the government will be able to track you down and find transactions you didn't declare tax on. Personally I believe that paying taxes is not only the fair thing to do but also good for bitcoin adoption as it helps legitimise the currency.

It's similar to holding 1.4b in apple or Google shares in that she would not be able to exchange it all for fiat (eg usd) currency in a day. If she tried the price of bitcoin would collapse as her as a bitcoin seller outpace all buyers globally. If she sold say, 100k usd worth a month over several years the price would likely sustain this. But at the same time it would probably not be a great investment because the bitcoin price is likely to increase and the buying power of usd is likely to decrease due to inflation and the government printing more usd. 
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:10:17
 I see bitcoins main potential to be as a currency and store of value which is what people buying btc are betting on. The carbon footprint is much higher because btc has to be mined and transactions have to be verified by the network. Where as a visa transaction may be recorded in a hundred private visa servers and secured with physical security, a btc public transaction but be recorded in tens of thousands of nodes. In the future, if btc scales, it will be hundreds of thousands of nodes. Therefore only high value transactions would be worthwhile sending over the btc network. Without viable microtransactions btc will lose some of its intrinsic value.

BU vs SW seems like a wholly political power struggle without a single right answer. Sure, the argument can be made that there are only a handful of miners and it's making btc more centralised. However good luck trying to convince and reason with a miner whose job literally requires him  not understanding. To be fair, if we were in their shoes we'd be looking out for our own interests too. Right or wrong, satoshi gave miners the ability to block segwit. I think the upshot of this is that they have expensive fixed assets invested in mining equipment. This equipment will be worthless if btc is zero. Blocking segwit will lower the btc price until they come to a point where it's no longer profitable for them to continue blocking segwit. They have to trade off and balance this against the benefit of increased transaction fees each day the impasse goes on.

Buffet also said that you do not have to be an expert in everything but stick to what you know and you'll be successful. Buffet never invested in tech companies like Microsoft because he doesn't understand them. He's only begun investing in companies like Apple more recently because his investment managers have bought them. Also keep in mind his biggest holding is wells fargo, a bank. It's not in his interest to promote bitcoins potential.

Both lifo and fifo concepts are borne out of accounting for non fungible physical inventory and the real world practicalities that apply. For example miners can use lifo as they physically stack heavy piles of goods and it would not be practical to take an inventory out from the bottom of the pile of heavy stuff. So they take off the top which is usually the last they put in. Even in the real world Lifo is rarely an accepted accounting method and banned under ifrs standards which covers almost all countries except USA. You would have to have a really good commercial reason to use lifo other than for Saving on tax.

The price will go up and it'll also go down but not necessarily in that order. Don't buy into the belief that you can some how try to time the white noise and predict exactly when the bubble will burst. The truth is that no one really knows. Don't play with more than you can afford to lose, but if you have a long term view of the value of btc then take a gamble as a long bet and hodl.
