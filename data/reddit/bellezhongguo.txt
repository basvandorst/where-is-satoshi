Because it’s not relevant to you or the people around you. Although that’s also the case for me, from my perspective if you look at what’s happening in Venezuela where people have used bitcoin as a result of serious government infractions, finding a way to make an income through mining or Zimbabwe where the price is over 10,000 USD because their currency backed by the government (or should I say “controlled”) is unstable but they have to pay for their children’s education, think about their family’s futures (and secure them), among other expenses. Many countries around the world, especially those with a large amount of the population living in poverty cannot trust their own currencies, cannot trust their governments. And as someone said in a previous comment, some of them can’t even have a bank account this will change their lives. Maybe not yours but it will change theirs and it already is.
There’s also a technological perspective for me where I think banks are too slow, too many fees and the technology is so antiquated I don’t see why they even still exist but I’m the kind of person that if I could I’d do everything digitally and hope that our world transitions into a more digital world. For you this is merely an investment but for the people without bank accounts this is potentially financial freedom and ability to participate in wealth generation with no barriers. For me, this is the future I want to be a part of I want banks to disappear and debit/credit cards I want it all to go away.
