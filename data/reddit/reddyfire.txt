And that's how you take over 3 million dollars and flush it down the toilet.

Cloud mining from their commodity exchange cex.io.

I might have to go back to the xbox again now that they take an acceptable form of online payment.

WE GOT A BURN NOTICE ON YOU.  YOU'RE BLACKLISTED!

Bitcoin was worth nothing when I first started mining it.  Last year in April when it hit $200 that was a big deal and it didn't get any higher than that until October 2013.  It's still over $500 which is a lot compared to when I first got into mining.  Mining should never be about profit it should be about securing the network so bitcoin can continue to be used.  IF you're on here complaining about a price drop from $650 to $550 then you might want to consider not mining bitcoin.

That must be where their new 99.9% maintenance fee on their cloud hashlets is going.  To pay for his body guards.

Bought the 20 GHS "Platinum" Contract in October 2013 for 5 btc and was promised $5000 after the first year.  Contract was useless after 3 months.  Then they only give me .02 btc for contract buy out.  Worst decision I ever made fuck cloudhashing.

I sure wish it was 2013 again.

Better than investing money to mine it.

My thoughts exactly when I saw this in 2013.  Quite the FPGA farm there.

I finally got my Jalapeno I ordered back in February about 2 weeks ago.  The damn thing is practically worthless now produces about .03 btc on a good day.  But it helps supplement with the amount of NVC I'm mining everyday.

Now their site is down and its been down all day.  I was able to pull my funds out on Tuesday after trying over and over again now I can't anymore.  I ended up moving over to 50btc.

I used them last week to transfer some funds into paypal from mtgox.  Order failed I emailed their support and within minutes I received my funds in my paypal account and a response from their support.

Just glad I got my 1.06 btc balance out before they could take more.  But kind of want my .20 balance still on the site before I left.  Every little bit helps when saving for the new butterfly labs jalapeno and I only need a little bit more to get there.
