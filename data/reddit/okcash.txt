The ROKOS OS is released for free, the only income for support development and new devices / upgrades / releases are by Donations and Coins integration Claims, All included currencies have claimed a position, proving true support for their communities and adoption. Any cryptocurrency developers or communities can request or claim a permanent position to get a cryptcurrency added in coming releases by filling the requirements over the support thread, ROKOS is worked directly with all included cryptocurrencies ensuring the security of a clean and quality platform to download for free and empower every user and their cryptocurrencies, ROKOS v4 had more than 1,400 Downloads, can only continue to expect great things and more integration as the System evolves, This ROKOS v5 release is for Raspberry pi 2 devices, working already for the release for Raspberry pi 3 devices and PINE64+ devices in the coming weeks. Thanks everyone for your support.   ~OKtoshi

ROKOS will continue to be released for more devices, Pi 3, ondroid, orange pi, PIN64+, etc every IoT device will be able to run a ROKOS version, Just download, burn in MicroSD and ready for use, cant get simpler and cheaper than that, everyone is able to turn their IoT device into a full BTC and Cryptocurrencies fullnodes/wallets, and enjoy the full benefits it brings.

Everyone is free to have their own opinions, a lot of users will love it as it saves a lot of time and can use out of the box, and some will say is useless without even giving it a try, thanks for your feedback tho. 
Resume of the project:
Cryptocurrency and the Internet of Things Raspbian based OK OS with integrated Cryptocurrency wallets
We've seen new services selling "stake miners" for different currencies, we support the new technology and uses for cryptocurrencies in the Rapberry Pi environments, hence we came up with a Free solution for every Pi enthusiast, developer, user, service that want to try their first cryptocurrencies on their Pi systems, or that would like to turn their Pi into a Staking device, It already includes a synched and fully functional wallet for OKCash to provide them with the best and easier Out of the Box experience.
v2 Update: Based on feedback and more research we find out that a lot of new crypto users have issues for getting Bitcoin, Litecoin and Dogecoin wallets to work in their Pi, and some people complain about the long time it takes to compile the wallets and get them running, so BTC, LTC, and DOGE wallets and daemons are included in ROKOS since the v2 release and forward.
The First OS image release that merges the full power of Raspbian and Cryptocurrencies: - ROKOS v1 comes with an integrated OKCash wallet and Synched Chain. Released on Jun 9 2015. - ROKOS v2 and forward includes the Bitcoin, OK, Litecoin and Dogecoin Wallets. (OK Chain Synched) Released on Jun 30 2015.

Feel free to test it or audit it, and/or leave your feedback on any of the official threads (BTCT or Pi Forums)
@_date: 2015-07-01 11:45:01
Yes can be done and added to work list.

OS already has a lot of the libraries required to compile most of cryptocurrencies, you can try compiling your altcoin daemon like this:
- git clone 
- cd altcoin
- cd src
- make -f makefile.unix USE_UPNP=-
that should compile the daemon for that altcoin, feel free to share feedback or ask any question in the official thread so it can remain for future users with same doubts, we will share more friendly manuals later on.
P.S: you should remember to open the ports of that altcoin in the firewall, you can do it with
- sudo ufw allow PORT/TCP

Your Bitcoins are safe, just make a backup of your wallet.dat as the guys in here suggested :)
Now, Procedure to use them almost immediately : 
1.- Dump private key of the address that got the bitcoins: (works same way for bitcoin, follow same steps to get your private key) 
2.- Import the private key to your blockchain.info wallet: "possibly the easiest way to import a private key is using Blockchain.info's My Wallet service. When successully imported through the "Import/Export" screen, the bitcoins assigned to a private key can be immediately sent to any Bitcoin address. " from: 
or if you are not in a hurry, let the bitcoin client finish to sync and your bitcoins will appear in the wallet after it syncs. (if you see it frozen for long time try restarting it to let it continue with sync process)
