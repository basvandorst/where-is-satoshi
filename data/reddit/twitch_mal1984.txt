Mining profitability is mostly irrelevant for the health of bitcoin because difficulty can go down. Bitcoin will be fine so long as it beats the profitability of computationally disrupting the network.

I was watching this play itself out on Bitfinex repeatedly this past week. People on Bitfinex seem to be largely unsophisticated, I watched a few obvious individuals get away with the equivalent of mass murder on there.

When people value something only for it's rising price they'll stop valuing it the moment it loses that property. I doubt many of the people hodling on this board could hodl their way through 3 years (like Bitcoin late 2014-early 2017) without a new all time high.

Look at the transactions, most of the transactions in the mempool are less than a third of even economic transaction fees from 3 weeks ago. The mempool meme is just a lot of low-amount low-fee transactions. Bitcoin certainly has a scalability problem but the current mempool isn't it.

If there's one thing smarter than HODLing it's doing the opposite of whatever Cramer says.

The exchange price on the bitstamp (Coinbase) exchange is the commonly accepted USD:BTC exchange rate. 
Exchange prices are determined by the last filled order on the books. A filled order happens when a new buy order is a higher price than the lowest existing sell order, or a new sell order is a lower price than the highest existing buy order. When that happens, the orders are filled at the price of the oldest order until no overlap between buy and sell orders exist.

Bitcoin makes it less expensive, faster, and less time-consuming to do many common types of transactions. The use of bitcoin is eating away at an industry of financial services as well as making valuable transactions possible that otherwise may not be possible or valuable. A lot of the 'win' for the winners is a reflection of the increased economic efficiency/activity bitcoin permits. Speculation, including "HODL"ing is the near-zero-sum aspect of markets. I say near because speculation often provides external value to non-speculators, not just to the speculators "winners" who beat other "loser" speculators.

Apologies, I seemed to remember Coinbase using the bitstamp exchange, and since Coinbase was more recognizable to users I thought it was a clarification. Either Coinbase has long moved on from using bitstamp or my memory is faulty. Regardless, Coinbase does not currently seem to use Bitstamp.

Most of the talk is in terms of bitcoin as a speculative investment. "making money" "cashing out" "profits"
Very few of the people here seem to understand where bitcoin's value comes from so most of the current market price, if this sub is a good indication, is just a result of hype around making money. That's unsustainable because those same people don't have a reason to value bitcoin independently of it's rising price.

The ideal way to frame these assets to your wife assuming you don't trust her judgment and/or loyalty at her worst times would be to phrase it in the form of additional income. You are "earning" money "trading" bitcoins, not you "have" assets that you're "selling" for money. Make it clear that due to 1. taxes, 2. your and/or her history of spending beyond your means, and 3. the technical risk involved it's not possible nor reasonable to "get out" "all at once". Tell her you believe that it is possible to begin paying down your debts and that without realizing it you had saved up enough by "trading" bitcoins to put a large down payment on a house, thereby guaranteeing low mortgage payments and that if she would like she could even quit her job. Tell her that this "income" could begin to go away depending on how the markets behave. Do not let her pressure you into making mistakes. Do not make those mistakes yourself. Watching the price go up and down (even wildly) over years is not a mistake. Don't use up all your bitcoins.
Split up your bitcoins, perhaps even buy some altcoins, with the design to give yourself plausible deniability concerning how much you have or have access to. 
She could absolutely obtain these assets (legally speaking) in case of divorce. Everything is up for grabs in divorce, even your potential future earnings and your ability to pay down debt.
A lie would be particularly damaging, but the truth could be equally or more so, so just tell her the truth regarding the parts she can be expected to understand. If people are not capable of making rational choices regarding something (and with money it is EXTREMELY DIFFICULT for ANYONE), then the truth will not often help them come to truthful conclusions.
Edit: I forgot to mention that 1.8 million isn't as much as you might think. It's likely not enough to retire on unless you are extremely good with money which you said you were not. Also, explain your reluctance to talk about specifics for of security reasons. Many criminals would be willing to kidnap someone for $100k. You have to take precautions like safety deposit boxes to store your assets now that your "trading" has paid off.

This is factually incorrect. BCH and BTC can coexist fine. BCH implemented replay protection specifically so that they could coexist. Please do not spread FUD.

Some people call it an attack for disagreement reasons but there's also the technical term "attack" of the network referring to something that disrupts a network (significantly or insignificantly) by sending data in an unexpected or unsolicited way, causing confusion, wasted bandwidth, and/or wasted processing power and at worst errors, crashes, disruptions or denials of service. It doesn't matter if it's intentional, or simply a malfunctioning client, that would be considered an "attack" in a technical sense.
Because of the choices of those forking to segwit2x, those S2X nodes will effectively (to nonS2X nodes) be "fake" nonS2X nodes, which could cause massive and prolonged (though temporary) disruptions to both networks. This was not the case with "Bitcoin Cash" which implemented replay protection thereby isolating the two networks and preventing disruption.
@_date: 2017-11-14 13:07:22
They implemented replay protection. Not everyone who uses bitcoin cash participated in anything shady, probably not even most. This is pure pettiness on the part of OP.
