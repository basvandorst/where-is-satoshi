You do realize people could steal your private key for a hot wallet and take your BTC that way, right?
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:51:11
That's not possible, however, lightning transactions have a percentage-based fee, whereas blockchain transaction have a fixed fee, no matter if you're sending a satoshi or a thousand BTC. At some point it becomes cheaper to go on chain instead of through LN.
EDIT: I'm expecting the large hubs to have open channels between them with several BTC in them to allow for lots and lots of transactions.

The problem is that with the current difficulty for mining running a mining operation will not make a profit (unless the value of the USD went up like crazy to hit parity with BTC).
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:57:10
BTC cannot leave a channel, they're essentially locked in a multisig wallet for the time the channel is open.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:52:13
Yep, that will happen, it'll be interesting to see how it develops.
@_date: 2018-01-27 20:51:15


Not even that I'd say.
@_date: 2018-01-27 18:32:12
If you create a Lightning Network node you can collect fees if payments are routed through your channels. However, you'd need to put some BTC in the payment channels you maintain and the fees are really tiny.

Would you be so kind to elaborate on hot wallet security?
@_date: 2018-01-22 12:09:22
What is more likely (if you ask me) is that there will be companies who offer LN access where users (and/or other companies who want to take LN payments) sign up and open a channel with which they can pay. Once all the BTC in their channel has been moved the company closes the channel, giving just one on-chain tx for what can be lots of payments. For companies who want to take LN payments the same happens.
Another option for customers would be being able to "top off" their LN channel by sending BTC to their LN provider, who will then transfer those BTC back through their LN channel, effectively resetting their balance. This way you can keep a channel open for a very long time with (fewer!) on-chain transactions to rebalance the channel.

$3500 would change quite a lot for me tbh (tbf, I'm a student). Still, using borrowed money to invest is bad practice, regardless of amount.

EDIT: Got myself a beautiful exit code (1/failure) when trying to start bitcoind.service, any advice?

Because that happened?
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:54:03
Adding to this, if you spend multiple times from one address you're definetely better off sending your BTC to a segwit address now. And while you're at it you can consolidate it into one (or a few, one for spending, one for hodling) address.
@_date: 2018-01-22 14:38:17
I stand corrected, thank you for clearing that up!
@_date: 2018-01-23 10:20:50
The service didn't even start, so no logfile was created, I'm currently working on setting up Lightning in another way.
EDIT: Trying to get lnd working, but I'm currently unable to start it as a background process. It's a work in progress, we're getting there.
@_date: 2018-01-29 02:12:38
Usually exchanges use a new address for every new transaction you make to them, you'll want to get in touch with their support if they haven't confirmed it tomorrow.
@_date: 2018-01-22 23:05:38
What happened exactly?
@_date: 2018-01-29 18:00:32
Correct. However, you do not need to create a channel with everybody you'd like to pay to, you can just connect to any reasonably well-connected node and send and receive payments through there.
@_date: 2018-01-29 01:48:13
I see you're using `lnd`, do you have a guide or some tips on doing that? I've been trying to set up a lightning testnet node on my Raspberry Pi, but I couldn't get lnd to run in neutrino mode.
@_date: 2018-01-26 12:01:28
According to what I heard somewhere else on this subreddit, 4PM GMT.
@_date: 2018-01-22 11:05:14
Yes, every transaction creates a new time-locked contract. Thus you can have a channel open for years if it is used regularly.

The "few people" who decide are people who have studied the field they're deciding about, they have spent literal years of their lives learning as much about their field as possible and have specific goals ("keep unemployment low and prices stable").
I don't think I'm competent enough to have any say in the field of economics. Hell, I don't think I should have anything to say about the field I'm studying because I don't know enough about it. Why should somebody who doesn't understand economics decide about economics?
Democracy isn't a perfect system, in my opinion it's not even a good system, however, it's the best system we have. I don't consider myself qualified to have any say in legislation in my country, I don't know enough about it. However, other people (who may know more or less about politics than me) are also voting, I'm just voting to try and ensure that our parliament is a good reflection of the population.

Then you create your own node that you only connect to nodes you want to work with. Nothing is stopping you from doing that.
Another thing is that with the described onion routing the large nodes will not know for whom or for what they are routing, so it's not like you can censor effectively.

I'd argue they are not the same type of centralization:
- Starting a bank requires a lot of money and even more paperwork. You can censor payments, keep clients from accessing their money and much more shitty stuff (to be fair, most banks where I live aren't that shitty).
- Running a large LN node requires some hardware, preferably a full Bitcoin node and some funds (let's say you're putting 1 BTC in). Now you can route payments. You don't know who sent it, nor where it's going, so you cannot censor the payments unless you just want to cut off one other node. If you do this to many nodes most transactions will be routed elsewhere, possibly through smaller nodes. The thing is that a LN node can't censor specific users.

No, it's just a clickbait title written by some idiot journalist who wants more views for their article;
















* It'll look different; I don't doubt it. Look at how much has changed, even in the last year. 
* There will have been many hard forks: Sure, I could make a hard fork now if I wanted to, doesn't mean people would use it.
* "It looked like bitcoin was just fading away," he added. "It's so hard to predict these things.": The ATH in december was a bubble, it burst, we're not in the recovery phase ("bitcoin spiked and then crashed!", somebody link that video please), but we're still at about 3 times last year's price. Nobody can predict the future, so he's right there as well. 
* "It looks like a bubble": Well, he's not wrong I suppose? It can look like a bubble, hell, I'm not even sure it's not a bubble, but I like what it is and what can be done with it (and it's my get rich quick scheme ofc), so I'm in for the ride.
The actual shiller in that interview seems to be the interviewer or editor, because I have a feeling a lot of interesting things the guy might've said have been left out.
@_date: 2018-05-31 12:10:03
Hey, it's nice to have hope. If you ask me we shouldn't be all "oh man, *random event in the future* will surely make BTC prices go up", we should just relax and enjoy the ride.

Let's break this down;
So, at the top it shows the BTC address, which does indeed hold .002 BTC (which is the number at the bottom of the page).
There's an 8-ball in the left bottom corner and a 13 in a grey circle at the right top corner.
Over the BTC logo there's 20 groups (4 rows of 4, followed by 2 of 3 with "Rot" said near the spot where the 4th entry would be in the first 3-row) of 8 dots, sorted in 3x3 groups with one dot missing.
On the right there's a large block of letters a-h with spaces mixed in, 12 symbols per row, 36 rows total.
Under this block there's a string saying "m/49'/0'/0'/0/8".
Then there's the number 16256242013523171915 in a grey text field just left from the large block, near the bottom.
Now... I have no idea what I should be doing. I was thinking a-h encode for 0-7, but what are the spaces for? And what are the groups of dots for? I'm thinking about trying ROT(n), but I'm not sure how to do this all. In case people are interested, here's the big block of a-h letters:
    hbeghb beabc
     cdacfhcdde 
    agfed agfghf
    ec  beacfecd
    fbahcddb  af
    dghagfgehgbh
    ecd cbec ghb
     afhfefbaacf
    gbhagddghed 
    aefab acffba
     cddecdb hgd
    bghghfgeh ce
    ghb cbaefacf
    acfhfe cd db
    ed agdbghgeh
    b h cfabcfba
    facadbde hgd
    gedgehghf ce
    fba cbacfghb
    hgdhfe dbacf
     ceagdgehed 
    c bghbabcacf
    hgfacfde d b
    daeed ghfgeh
    abcab acfghb
    de dec dbacf
    ghfghfgehed 
    a cghb beacf
    dbfacfhcddb 
    gehed agfgeh
    acf cbabc fa
    db hfede gbc
    gehagdghfhed
    acfab ecd be
    d bdec afhcd
    gehghfgbhagf
Quick edit: ROT(n) with the base in the order that they're being listed (6, 1, 4, 1, 3, 2, 3, 2, etc) for all the letters including the space at the start or beginning of the alphabet, then try encoding it all as bytes?
EDIT: Nevermind, no easy progress so far, so I'm going to focus on studying right now instead.

Let's say we try to ban Chinese miners. How do we determine a miner is from China? Their IP? There's VPN's for that.  
They could also run their hardware in another country with cheap electricity and be owned by Chinese parties. How are you going to account for that?  
It's not desirable (if we can exclude group *x* we can also exclude group *y*, and who determines who gets excluded?) and not doable either. If people want to spend their money to spam the mempool they can be my guest, it's impossible to keep up indefinetely anyways.

It's been a while since I looked at it, but Neutrino mode is essentially a mode in which lnd uses another full bitcoin node instead of using a local full bitcoin node.
