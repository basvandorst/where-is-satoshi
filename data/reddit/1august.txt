If we're all lucky, the community will come together on a single chain (as they did with the other two Ethereum forks after DAO), and you can just sweep it like you would today and carry on with your life.
If we end up with more than one chain, you will need to sweep it separately for each chain.
In both cases, your current set up should keep you safe, and you should be okay without any changes.

Breadwallet seeds are BIP39, and not compatible with Electrum etc. That said, you can still use a tool like [this]( to retrieve the private key for individual addresses from your seed, and import those into Electrum, Mycelium, or any other wallet.
In essence, you have a path to accessing your coins on all chains in the event of a split.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:58:40
We will work on a table over the coming week, takes a while to collect all the data. Would be great if you can PM us if you find anything!
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:53:45
We are not in a position to state Breadwallet's standing, sorry! You might have better luck reaching out to them directly. If you do hear back, please let us know as we're working on compiling a table of which wallets and exchanges will be supporting what!
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:03:57
We're adding them in the next update!
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:37:21
Looks like Keepkey is also out of stock. We aren't familiar enough with any besides these three to give recommendations.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:45:21
Yes. Any bitcoin that exist before the split will exist on all forked chains. If you have 2 btc today, you'll have 4 if there are two chains, 6 if there are three, and so on. 
The value, however, will likely take a nosedive.
@_date: 2017-06-18 18:09:32
There's no pressing need to move them to another wallet

1August.org is an effort by enthusiasts and professionals in the Bitcoin and Altcoin space.
Our goal is to put together a guide for the regular bitcoin user to be able to understand what is going on, and how they can be safe over the next couple of months. 
This guide is targeting the business owners accepting bitcoin, the college kids who dabbled with it, the retired folks who invested in it, and all other kinds of people who just want to use bitcoin and move money around without having to worry about forks and scaling and proposal wars.
We are looking for community help in checking our facts, suggestions on improving the guide, and help in advertising the site to the users it aims to serve - the guys and girls who use Bitcoin but don't hang around on reddit and bitcointalk forums. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:46:16
We are working on a more comprehensive list of wallets, but the sheer number of them makes it impossible to cover all of them.
@_date: 2017-06-18 17:14:12
You are correct - If the chain does split, the same seed will give you access to your bitcoin on all chains. The only differentiating factor is which wallet is broadcasting on which chain.
@_date: 2017-06-18 12:20:36
We will rephrase it to be less concrete.
That said, there is absolutely no guarantee that the exchanges will indeed list all forks. It is possible that a fork may completely die out, or may not.
The only way to ensure you can be safe in any eventuality is to be in control of your coins.
@_date: 2017-06-19 03:28:18
Yes, you should be fine!
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:09:35
Great feedback. We will work on incorporating those today.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:15:11
Hi! We're the team behind [1august.org](
None of us here have used Coinjar before, but from taking a quick look, it doesn't look like they support exporting your private keys.
While there isn't anything inherently wrong with using such services, we would recommend moving your Bitcoin to a wallet such as Electrum or Mycelium sometime in the next month or so, allowing you greater freedom in the event of a fork.
Any more feedback on the site is greatly appreciated! We are also working on an "After the split" section which should help address some of your concerns in more detail.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:52:46
Keep control of your private keys, and be very careful about any transactions in the days immediately following any fork. We will have a section on that up soon.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:17:08
You should be fine! Your seed words can be used to recreate your private keys outside of trezor
@_date: 2017-06-18 10:52:04
Thank you, we will fix that in the next update scheduled to go out in about an hour.

BIPs are proposals that add features or improvements to the Bitcoin codebase. [BIP39]( is the proposal that discusses using mnemonic seeds for generating addresses as a secure and reproducible method of generating wallets with multiple addresses.
Unfortunately, these seeds were not standardized until BIP44. By the time that came along, breadwallet had already implemented their system. 
The consequences of this essentially boil down to an extra step for you in shifting your private keys from breadwallet to Electrum or another BIP44 wallet. If you were shifting from Electrum to Mycelium, you could simply type in your words and be done. Instead, you'll first have to use a tool like [this]( to retrieve the private key for individual addresses from your seed, and import those into Electrum, Mycelium, or any other wallet.
@_date: 2017-06-18 11:32:31
Absolutely. Will be added soon.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:22:33
Breadwallet should be fine, just be aware that if you need to move your private keys, you will need to use a tool such as [this]( to export them. Breadwallet uses BIP39 seeds, which are incompatible with the BIP44 seeds used by Electrum, Mycelium, and most other wallets.
It's just an extra step, and does not mean you are at risk by using breadwallet in the event of a fork.
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:51:31
Breadwallet appears to be using BIP38 12-word mnemonic seeds, so you should be able to use [this tool]( (offline, on a clean computer of course) to export individual private keys and import them into another wallet.
Most other seeded wallets follow BIP44, which allows you to directly import the seed into another BIP44 compatible wallet without needing to go through a tool like the above.
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:36:09
We are not in a position to guarantee individual wallet's policies on forks. However, Mycelium and Electrum both have seeds and export keys that can be imported into other wallets that are working with both/the other chain in the event that these two stick to only one.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:35:31
Nothing is certain. We've tried to phrase it to be "if" or "in the event of a fork" as much as we could. If we missed something, please let us know!
@_date: 2017-06-19 11:17:32
You don't need to export keys in all scenarios. It's just that BIP32 seeds are incompatible with BIP44-only wallets. If Breadwallet decides to only support one chain, and Electrum decides that they will let you choose/support the other chain, then you must go through the manual process.
If you have wallets that all follow the same seed rules, you definitely just type in your seed and be done with it.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:03:25
Absolutely. We recommend that you always move your coins *by transaction* to a wallet or paper wallet that you have created yourself.
We'll update our wording to reflect that more clearly.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:23:07
Electrum and Mycelium are excellent wallets, although any open source, well reviewed wallet should be fine.
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:07:09
Coinbase is likely a bad idea - You have no access to your private keys.
Ledger Nano works great, just keep your seed words safe!
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:08:38
Waiting isn't necessary, just keep control over your private keys.
Coinbase wallets would not be ideal, as you have no access to your private keys (although in the event of a split, it would be surprising if Coinbase did not let you access all chains through them).
In any case, controlling your own private key is the safest option.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:13:48
There have been two forks after the DAO fork that did not create new coins.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:39:44
Yes, Armory keys can be exported if needed. You should be fine!
@_date: 2017-06-18 16:22:19
No one can guarantee that Coinbase will let you access both chains except Coinbase. We would recommend that you shift any coins from Coinbase to your own wallet.
You won't have to do anything with your nano. The ledger will keep operating on (at least) one chain, and you can use the seed phrase to set up a wallet on the other chain with your coins. This is something you will need to do with any wallet application, and is not specific to the Ledger series.
@_date: 2017-06-18 14:54:09
Blockchain.info does technically allow you to export private keys, but with any online wallet or exchange, you are by default only "owed" Bitcoin. If they decide to cease to give you your private key, you have no power to access your bitcoin.
We recommend storing your bitcoin on a wallet where you have complete control for this reason.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:29:08
This advice is standard to more or less any cryptocurrency fork, not really Bitcoin or August 1st specific. We mostly went with the August 1st branding due to the larger impact it will have if a fork does occur, as there are many Bitcoin users who do not necessarily frequent reddit/bitcointalk and just want to get on with their lives.
Things may have changed, been a while since any of us used Blockchain.info. We'll sign up with fresh accounts and make sure we're up to date, thank you for the note!
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:25:59
We're a small group, and include employees at well-known bitcoin sites.
@_date: 2017-06-19 04:21:13
We will be following it closely, and moving to a fixed updated schedule for the website (every 6 hours etc.), unless something goes drastically sideways, in which case we will update faster.
@_date: 2017-06-18 15:06:11
It's in the next update!
@_date: 2017-06-18 13:18:10
Indeed. We are working out how to phrase that appropriately (hence the delay in putting the information up).
@_date: 2017-06-19 02:39:21
You will have double the amount of coins. If you have 2 btc now, it will become 2 btc on all chains after the fork.
Your monetary value, however, will likely reduce. A price drop is expected in the event of a fork.
