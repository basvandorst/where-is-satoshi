I looked at this one, yes.
Perhaps I'm missing something here - i see that it has a console which takes commands, is that what you mean? (I was hoping for an actual api)
Edit: been looking into this a bit more, and my understanding here is that I'd either need to write a wrapper around the electrum source (i.e. write my own api), or run an rpc server (e.g. RPyC) from within the console.  Neither of these is what I'm looking for (but if all else fails, I guess I could do the former).

It's ~22GB no?
That's an issue where I'm running it (on an embedded device)

Create &amp; monitor transactions and addresses primarily.
I'm currently using bitcoind for this, but the size of the blockchain is becoming an issue.  (So basically I want a replacement for the bitcoind rpc server).
Unfortunately it can't be dependent on a third party web site (otherwise I'd just use blockchain.info) :(

Yup, that's what I've done to keep it running for now.
(it's a temporary thing though, can't really leave it like this)

thanks, examples definitely help!
I also found this (for the benefit of anyone else doing this):
This isn't really ideal for me, but I think I can make it work.

ok, no fault then.  I guess I just didn't see it.
had a dig for the tx, and I'm pretty sure it was [this one](  of course it shows as sunday here, coz that's when it finally got into the block chain, but I initially sent it on saturday night (probably early sunday morning utc).  It has fees as you can see (the default fee for 1 confirmation in bitcoin-core at the time)

That's interesting!  Last saturday was the first time I actually had trouble getting a tx into the blockchain (there was some symbol I hadn't seen before next to it, and a message like "will retry later" - sorry, but can't remember the exact details).
It might have been more responsible of you to announce the test publicly beforehand though?

Well this thread prompted me to check through a few of my addresses - one of them had ~2.8 million coins received.
Sadly there is less than one coin in that address now :(
