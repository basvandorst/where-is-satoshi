I didn't even have a pc when I was 16 lol

Thanks. I actually tried it on my 3 years old 4.4 android tab. That's exactly what I had in mind while making it.

For more info you can go here: 
It's a free android app that you can install on your old (or new) phone or tablet and put it on your table for price updates.
It was inspired by raspberry pi projects that shows prices, so I made it 100% customizable. You can create/modify/import /export themes to give your cryptoclock different look. I'm not good with colors so I have only included two themes. Depending on your feedback I'll complete the theme creator documentation (even though I think it's sort of self explanatory)
I hope you guys like it. It's completely free, no ads.

This started as a pet project of mine (didn't even plan on putting it on playstore since 25$ for developer sign up lol), so I wanted to see if others will find it useful, if i see enough interest I'll definitely add more exchanges.
As for the UI, since this app is designed to mostly sit on your table as a clock, I mostly worked on the theme maker. You can fully customize color, position, borders, margins, paddings, opacity of pretty much everything on screen. But yes I agree the starting page needs more attention. I'm just getting started on android.
And thanks your valuable feedback.

Lol my friends still laugh even though they know the price now.

Decentralized exchanges. Mass crypto adoption. Privacy coins.

I use bitcoin to buy domains and also for xbox games. Actually i got forza 3 last week for 25$ from Microsoft store. No regrets though. I'm far more comfortable in sending btc and waiting 2 hours to get it funded so i can buy games, than to put my credit card in there. But I haven't made any purchase for more than 50 bucks i think.

Well it's hard to keep track of $1 refunds. As far as I can tell i never got refunds. Just a month ago, Google declined a 25$ payment without giving me any specific reason and i kept on trying after 30 minutes as it suggested and that's 9$ I'll never see again lol. Worst part, I contacted them about it, they never replied. Needless to say i had the wrong billing address on file but ain't nobody got time for that lol. So i just choose btc over these hassles. If they don't care for it i got no choice but to give them my card and keep it there.

It really depends on the public awareness. At this point, bitcoin isn't really seen as the resilient store of value to the general public.
When the recession hits, if it's something like 2008, if the general public realize that the mistake was to give their hard earned money to the bank and trusting them to keep it safe for them, and now they have a choice to not do that, because now we have bitcoin, then the price will slowly go up as more and more people get tired of getting fucked by the banks.
But this level of awareness is not here yet, imo won't be here for at least a few more decades. So yep, btc will crash like everything else.

That's true, but that's not what I meant lol. I meant often times i forget it's in there and they end up charging it for subscription and stuff. And also, countless times they charged me 1$ for "card authentication", this has happened to me from Amazon and Google as soon as I added the card. So I prefer that I don't have any card on file while I'm not buying anything.

Think about this. Everyday more services are starting to accept bitcoins. I myself buy games from Microsoft store with bitcoins because my credit card doesn't work there and I'm not comfortable putting my credit card in there either. Now wall street is getting involved. The total number of bitcoins that can be mined is fixed. The more the demand, the higher the price hike. So the price hike definitely makes some sense.
That said, i agree with you. yes making btc your only investment would not be smart. And since it is unregulated market, keeping your btc in exchanges isn't either, for all you know they're going to get hacked and it'll be an inside job. Where there is a ton of people who is merely buying it out of speculation, and without knowing where bitcoin's value lies, bitcoin has massive potential to change the world economy. And people who believed in it has been greatly rewarded, and will probably continue to do the same.

I feel you. I got some in October and asked one of my good friends to buy it. And he saw that btc that i got on March is now 3 fold, he figured, why tf not, so he bought some through localbitcoins  It went to 5800 and crashed to 5400. He sold when it was 5600 again. I still haven't texted him the news lol.
I only wish someone had told me about bitcoins before i got to know about it myself. I don't even remember how i found it, but i remember i instantly tried to read and understand Satoshi's white paper. And it hasn't even been a year i think.

There's already a setting that changes text color but I'll add this on the next update.

I plan on learning iOS development. This is my first android app. iOS shouldn't take long.

Thanks man.

These would be cool states to have. If there's enough interest definitely I'll look into it.

30k, to every Indian. Man, what saddens me is not that politicians would promise something like this,it's the fact that they can make such an outrageous promise to the entire country of 1.3b and get public support and eventually go through with all the jackassery along with it. 
@_date: 2018-02-04 04:32:59
Depending on the exchange you can use eur cad jpy etc. More will come if requested. 
@_date: 2018-02-20 12:26:30
1. Give boss exchange bitcoin address.
2. Sell bitcoin as you get it
3. Buy bitcoin when you feel it's a good time to buy.
4. Pay your taxes so that corrupt politicians can keep their pockets heavy.
5. Tell your boss you sold your bitcoin because he can't trace any. 
Done.

My dad always told me money is like toothpaste, once out of your pocket, it no longer belongs to you. I hate the entire ecosystem of asset management right now. I hate banks. I try to buy land with my money instead of keeping it in banks when I have extra. Best would be to receive payments in btc, and banks will never see that btc.
