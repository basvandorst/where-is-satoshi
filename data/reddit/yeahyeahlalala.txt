Ordered Ledger Nano yesterday (25EUR from Amazon with Purse discount), looking forward to move all my coins. Exchanges got too risky, love Poloniex because of lending (+10-50% early) but ... never invest more than you're willing to lose so... Ledger, here we come! :) 
@_date: 2016-08-02 12:23:00
still the price should be around ~615$ (545eur) not too bad, isnt it? :)

whats the difference between paid porn and free? is there anyone who paid for porn? hmm ;/
@_date: 2016-08-29 03:28:26
Depends on many factors i.e. what kind of admin are you? Often have power outages? What kind of line and bandwidth? ...

VPS storage is still quite expensive. Home run server isnt reliable.

i'm also waiting over one day now which is not normal ;/

Better make a Buy Nothing Day and HODL!

It means less carded Amazon Gift cards in circulation. Supply of those has been dried out so now have to wait for another cryptolocker or hack.

Sent some coins from poloniex to kraken and they went through super fast.  Wondering what wallets people use for long lasting confirmations...? 
@_date: 2016-09-11 13:54:50
here its working fine :)

How much are you trying to withdraw?  I mean is it a very large amount or xxz$?  Which country are you in?
@_date: 2016-09-28 09:40:55
First of all  - relax. Breath in, breath out. Second, wish you luck with this one... IMHO MtGox is goner and it would be a miracle if people would get money back. As i see it you're angry because miracle isnt happening (of course you have a right to it and i really feel you bro). Keeping fingers crossed, a litttle bit more waiting ....

Dunno about California but hope you'll have a chance to try it out. Had many trades in some Eu country few years ago - easy with large trades, sometimes walked into me bank 6 times a day to in/out xx xxx EUR cash - no problemo! :) 
@_date: 2016-09-12 11:30:26
Which country do you stay in? Hope its btc friendly place  otherwise after some transactions you might raise red flags and get your whole bank account suspended. Happened many times to the traders :) 
@_date: 2016-09-11 07:36:23
Nope :( 
@_date: 2016-09-12 06:07:45
remember /bitcoin threads years ago? then it was real panic and fud all over the place!
@_date: 2016-09-19 10:08:44
Takin my coins out of paxfull... just in case...

I have received my Ledger Nano a week ago - brilliant device! It does the job and the rest ... all is super-good, haha :) Got it from purse.io for 27$ -20$ discount=21.6$ free shipping. That makes it pretty affordable hardware wallet :)

With Youtube - 25 downvotes and 0 upvotes comes a feeling that his product might fail

No price slippage (change of price). Have a look at the exchanges - if you would like to buy 2K of BTC then price would rise up to &gt;700$/btc. In auction one can buy large amounts of BTC for pretty much low price.

Sounds too good to be true - be careful! This one is very high probability scam!

Have any link to his last predictions? (450-&gt;750) Thanks!
@_date: 2016-10-29 07:45:23
With BTC sometimes you win, sometimes you loose. But at the end of the day all things are good. I'm 95% of my cash in BTC for ages and dont care about all this volatility much. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 06:13:54
haha, reallky funny show but... what does it has to do with BTC? :) usually BTC=nerds and no boobs... but this show is totally oposite ?:)

Listened to one 'economist' and didnt bought in 2013. Lesson learned - think your own head

@_date: 2016-10-16 20:04:46

@_date: 2016-10-23 13:35:23

Thats something new, haha :)

Are a localbitcoins trader? Any chance that you had many trades before that? Do you SEPA money to Kraken often? Cheers mate, hope you'll get your issues solved!
@_date: 2016-07-20 02:39:19
cheers mate, good luck! ":)
@_date: 2016-07-19 16:35:21
That was my guess. And that would be Kraken/bank guess, they dont like trading cash people. Many people trade insane amounts at localbitcoin without any declaration of operations/cashflow, i say that should raise suspicion. Hope that you have some income declaration form that you could send to Kraken to prove where did that cash came from. Should be easy ... Take it easy :) And good luck! :)

i already have 80% of my life savings in BTC. Would love to convert the rest but its super-emergency money. Hopefully in few years ...
