Lol. I turned off notifications for Reddit comments because any hate I get is always from Reddit. I’m glad I randomly checked this thread and saw this comment. I work really hard on my channel and I am always trying to get better. Seeing a comment like this helps me know I’m doing something right.

They only ban for the sake of FUD. I did an interesting story the other day about how supposedly WaltonChain is actually a Chinese government project. That would add a new wrinkle to their banning/unbanning FUDFest

That is the point I make at the end of the video. I agree with you! I hope that we never get confirmation.

I agree! From now episodes will be 3 minutes long (not including credits and theme song. While that one was an interview style, new episodes will be action episodes with storylines! Episodes airing every other Friday.

Tend to agree. Too volatile right now.

You sir are the reason mainstream wants nothing to do with crypto. Your elitist attitude and others like you is why people stay on the fringes. I hope your mom’s basement keeps you warm at night.

���� full disclosure: I wrote and recorded the song before I ever heard HodlGang. Of course once the John Oliver piece came out and I saw HodlGang I wished I had picked a different song. But I just went with it!

It’s like saying no offense before you say something terrible
