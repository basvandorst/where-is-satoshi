Yeah I just can't buy that. However my knowledge of bitcoin and cryptocurrencies is rather young and limited. I don't suppose any one could give me a rousing argument with valid  and verifiale sources that show this is possible or likely?

SELL SELL SELL. THIS IS NOT A FUCKING DRILL PEOPLE. GET OUT WHILE YOU CAN.

So was I, I just personally feel it'll drop a bit more. But I mean I really am no expert in this field so take that with a grain of salt. Hey I wish you the best my crypto companion.
Edit: I'm already wrong. What a day.
Edit2: I'm right  now.

Ok. And yes crypto currency is  a wild investment that could be comparable to betting at craps. What I'm saying is, it's ok to hope for the best. Don't invest more than you're willing to lose. The number 1 rule. But if I'm willing to lose this hundred dollars(for example), why shouldn't I hope it'll skyrocket in value? I feel we're arguing slightly different points. I mean no one buys into crypto with the hope it'll plummet.

Hey man, from one stranger to another, I'm glad you're alive, in good health, and happy. Oh and also, cancer is your bitch.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:20:10
Haha I know my friend I know. Keep on keeping on.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:56
What? Lol no. But why would someone make an investment they don't believe in. If you don't believe in bitcoin why are you in this sub?
@_date: 2017-12-27 02:54:42
You're not wrong, but I promise you it's easier to sell gold in bullion form rather than puddle form.

Huh interesting. I'll have to read more about this in the morning. I totally forgot what time it was here(about 4:45 am) until I realized the folks from across the pond were up. Will across the entirety of my country and then the pond but you get it. Hey the thanks for the insight and for pointing me in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-12-24 19:15:01
Inspirational? Nah. More like my thoughts on the manner. You guys seem to think I'm saying throw all your money into bitcoin and riding it out. I just think this guy is a dick for having a problem with someone hoping their investment will pay off.

You're a quitter aren't you? The kinda guy that sees something difficult and goes, "man I can't do that." But you never even tried. The guy who dreamed of being a gym coach when he was a kid. Most of the people on here don't really think a bitcoin will be worth a million dollars. But then again no one thought BTC would be worth 19 thousand either. The point is why not hope? It doesn't hurt to. So how about you keep your pessimism to yourself sir! And learn basic context clues about how much someone truly believes what they're saying, and when they're just verbalizing hopefull thoughts.

Like the 20th time I've seen this post in a day. I've never seen reposts of this level.

Oooooooh gimmie dat bitwallet. But no in all seriousness it's an awesome product and I'd love to win one! And merry Christmas you bitcoin lovin folks.

I'm foggy on that too. I can't confirm this, but from what I've seen today it had to do with they said it would happen later on, or not at all, and they opened it as bitcoin was in a dip. Some people argue that less informed people will buy bcash instead of bitcoin, not knowing it's really different, because it's check cheaper. And some people just don't like bcash. Once again, not necessarily my opinions, just what I've seen.

My point is I doubt the guy actually thinks it will hit 1 mil. But why not hope it will? You can hope for something unrealistic people.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:25:36
Until the hyperinflation of the fiat kills bitcoin or itself? 
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:35:23
Don't forget XRP on that blue fellow.
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:57:30
Cool, 4 more hours for the price to drop.
