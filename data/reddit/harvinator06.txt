The collapse was not the loans. It was the continual reselling of toxic assets marketed as low risk  AAA loans, when in fact they were extremely risky loans in the first place.  That's the ethical qualm,  knowing you are selling a bag of shit as a bag of gold.

Welcome to NYC, where you can essentially buy anything with a debit/CC except at a bodega or bar where you need to spend $8 or more. I know, for a fact, I can go to the coffee shop below my apartment and buy a small black coffee on a card.  
25 cents is awesome if the transaction is for $100 or more, but in comparison to a CC where the transaction fee is between 1-3% it's advantageous for a business to choose electronic USD over bitcoin when talking about small purchases.

But you'll also have several industries and local businesses that develop around the indivuals moving to Portugal to take advantage of this.  Though it will probably only stand for 10 years you'll have a boost in tax revenue if you can get a crypto industry/culture started in the nation.

I would agree that modern cashless payments systems are centralized, and while fiat itself is not, online market mechanism make it so.  Personally I’m curious if states will switch over in to a crypto USD/Euro/Pound... to regain power.  Imagine if the state begins to take over transactions processing and makes a cent of each transaction outside of taxes. There are many positives and negatives there but it is an interesting thought. 
@_date: 2016-11-24 18:40:52
That would essentially make it useless for small purchases of a dollar or two.

If they dump the price goes down. The market is flooded with supply and is progressively sold at cheaper and cheaper prices. However, they can just create turmoil and a lack of general confidence in the price making the average buyer of btc sell off their coins as well driving the market further and further down. 
That’s partially what we saw this weekend. People trying to get rich quick with BTH so they sold off their BTC stock piles. 
Personally I say fuck these guys for being dweebs and trying to rig the market in any functional way.

Now consider this with the sign up getting easier and along with the removal of average people from the employment equation.  Executives, stock holders, and faceless multinational corporations will make even more money per user along with gaining even more influence within politics.  By continuing the norms of our banking structure people will only lose out.   Decentralized cryptocurrencies return power to people, and in this day and age, that is much needed.

Lol, no not really... If you look towards the history of military control over the governing bodies of the legislature and executive of South Korea, you may think otherwise. Korea certainly has gained in position, in regards to the Cato institute's Freedom Index in the last 20 years, some 27th overall this year and up 3 positions since last, but in terms of people who are actually learned on the subject over a long period of time.  It's not a bastion of democracy in the greatest sense. Just like the Uniteds States, economic interests have captured the governoring bodies of the federal government and the press, in addition to the long conservative history of the nation's military on the populace and governoring instutions. 
Knowing that South Korea isn't North Korea, in 2019, does not cut it.

Every time a corrupt government steals the state’s resources and dolls out power within the party structure that state fails. Socialist institutions have been installed in nearly every government. Venezuela is corrupt as shit. They stole everything from the upper classes and distributed it to the poor, but these people were hoodwinked. Social services weren’t entirely boosted over the long term and the nation relied upon the price of oil to stay high. 
That’s the actual historical narrative you must look at. Diversify your economy, refrain from corruption, and quell progress. While the socialist party started doing the later their economy just couldn’t handle it.

I don't think the story is that simple.  All you have is a denial by companies who would not like to see their stock price tank on the short term.  Also, one could assume that the PR team(s) could be intentionally left in the dark as a means of executives protecting the stock price while not being held legally liable.  
It's a catch 22 though.  At this point, you need to double down with the conspiracy to maintain a narrative which is backed by anonymous sources.  You can even reverse the conspiracy back onto the state and say the story was planted.  
I am of the opinion that it's an unknown.  Actions like this have been done in the past.  Confirmation of tactics like this have been confirmed by the likes of Snowden amongst others in the past.

What you are referring to as capitalism is a free market system support by a democratically socialist government. Just like in the United States. It’s not either or. The modern world a mixture of both. 
Nearly zero scholarly work points to the disenfranchisemet of labor due to a lack of incentives, as the main reason for the failure of  the communist system. You can argue that many of the flaws within the single party system disenfranchised people, but a lack of incentive to work is far and away removed from any real notions of its failure. 
The communist party certainly did  stifle innovation by being exclusionary, but if you can get in you could be innovative, but obviously not as much as within a “free market” system.

When gold was available to be mined and procured by a nation state inflation could potentially be managed. However inflation and deflation was a problem that often plagued early America. A gold back currency wasn’t with major problems let alone in a modern era. wasn’t a catch all.  It required a massive amount of time donated to the acquisition, production and distribution of gold bars and bullion.  The system has benefits, but I think within a modern era it take on way more drawbacks.

While it is an interesting proposition that, yes the coin is backed by a McDonalds hamburger, the production and distribution is entirely based on the local fiat currency of the store. Making the potentiality of actually being able have a burger handed to you dependent upon the local fiat economy.
