The growth of this list   It's not really my top favorite but it's one of my favorites none the less.

Tell me again how far the 'them' and 'us' attitude will take us?

Bitcoin in 2010 ranged from approx $0.01 to $0.08 so..
2010 @ $0.01 x 1000 = $10.
2016 @ $720.00 x 1000 = $720,000.00.
2010 @ $0.08 x 125 = $10.
2016 @ $720.00 x 125 = $90,000.00.

Bitcoin is Segwit. Unlimited, ViaBTC and your suggestive title gave me a laugh tho.

Zcash isn't Bitcoin.  This post needs to be in the ALT coin section.
And warning regarding this alt-coin:  and this:

I'm currently a Bitcoiner. I enjoy owning my own bank and everything BTC has to offer, including, 24/7 global assist, 24/7 Blockchain support, that always directly connects me to thousands of live experts. For every one concierge service that fiat can buy, I can get seven hundred of them. Penthouse options are becoming a reality. Unlimited access to my bitcoins with options to pay whatever fee I choose. Priority pass to deal directly with whomever I want whenever I want. Uncounterfeitable funds with infrastructure security second to none on a global scale, multiple wallet options, new and exciting trade and exchange options, et cetera, et cetera. Bitcoin can also buy me things that no other currency or commodity can.

If so, that makes the title of this thread even more ridiculous then..
2010 @ $0.45 x 22.2 = $9.99 (close enough)
2016 @ $720.00 x 22.2 = $15,984.00
Summary: $10 worth of BTC back in 2010 even @ $0.01 does not equate to 1 million today, let alone 7 million.

The Blockchain that is Bitcoin changed everything many years ago. Wrap up what you will today in the new buzz word Blockchain and call it innovation if you wish, but with Bitcoin very few third party 'we'll save u!' services are ever needed. That people use them anyway, means that start-ups like yours have half a chance for a few years. I'm betting that your Bitcoin Business as you put it, could be more honestly stated as 'Remittance and Financial Services with Blockchain Tech - Oh And We Take Bitcoin!'

Poloniex did not immediately respond to Arstechnica's request for comment either when they were hacked back in 2014  so I'm guessing that they will get around to you when they can. An exchange without a phone number also, is no exchange I'd do business with. Hope all works out well for you though.

Still, 'News articles that do not contain the word "Bitcoin" are usually off-topic' Once it's done once..

$884.70 AUD
And from a $0.98 purchase, soars will do.

Perhaps this might help   It's not Albania but most of the principles would be the same.

Bitcoin Soars As 'Enter Whatever Text Takes Your Fancy Here' Except that Bitcoin soars because it doesn't fail where others do and that's about all there is to it, really.

My cat died the same week as my sister did, so that was pretty shitty. But Bitcoin is great and doing just fine. Thanks for asking.
