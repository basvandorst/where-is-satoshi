Why would you think that? That does not seem so obvious to me. Maybe if it were a one-time wire transfer. But if you had $82 mil go in and out of your account of the course of the year, you best believe the bank is getting their cut.

Right. In my imagination I am assuming using something like an American Eagle or other widely recognized gold coin.
I bet I could more easily convince a random grocery store clerk of its authenticity than to explain bitcoin. I may be underestimating grocery store clerks though.
@_date: 2018-07-24 01:03:21
This is an nonsensical argument. 
In the US I generally cannot buy groceries with Euros. That does not make it not a currency.
I _can_ buy groceries with Bitcoin in certain stores. That also does not make it currency. 
No one claiming gold is currency so I don't know how that is even relevant.
But I would probably have more success (on average) with gold in a random grocery store than with Bitcoin or with foreign currency, assuming I was willing to pay a large premium. (i.e. I would like this bread and milk for this American Gold Eagle.)

Clearly the tax bracket that doesn't itemize deductions.
Taxes are a game. When people complain about paying heinous rates it's because they don't know, or don't care to play. 
If you learn the rules and play smart you can easily and legally minimize your tax burden.

The alternative is don't send people to prison for drug possession. Especially if they are not hurting anyone but themselves. It's cheaper to treat an addict then to house a convict.

Yes I would underplay the numbers. The scale is immediately apparent to anyone, there is no need to wave your arms about it. Highlighting the insane growth only makes you sound the product of irrational exuberance, ie a bubble salesman. Institutional money is interested in growth over institutional time frames.

It depends on your intentions.
Are you trying to make a quick buck? Then wait for a dip, buy when it feels right, sell on the high. There is obviously no way to tell where those highs and lows are. You are really just gambling at that point.
Are you looking for a real, long term investment? Then small changes really don't matter in the long run. The price is pretty flat right now, go all in. Another bit of gambling you can add to the plan is have a little bit of fiat set aside in case there is a fire sale, you can get some more coin at a discount, but its really just in the margins when we talk about long term growth.
@_date: 2013-11-23 14:39:54

So they get past the users initial and automatic due diligence or checking if they are on the correct site, and then try to capture the credentials after the user has presumably let their guard down and turned their thoughts to the task at hand (whatever they logged in do)

What a coincidence, I am also developing a product that will totally blow the lid of the bitcoin price. I am in talks with some major private equity players in new york but its all super, double top secret, that's why I can't tell you about it and also why I am posting to Reddit about it in ambiguous,  non-specific terms.

**15:09:00 EST** -- Sen Tom Carper: Individual who sent the President ricin was a SR vendor. 
**15:13 EST** -- First witness: Jennifer Shasky Calvery | Director, Financial Crimes Enforcement Network, 
U.S. Department of the Treasury
**15:18 EST** --  Bitcoin just took a dive and has bounced back in the space of 5 minutes.
**15:20 EST** -- Shasky: "Fincen will continue to do everything in its power to prevent abuse of the American financial system"
**15:21 EST** -- Next witness: Mythili Raman| Acting Assistant Attorney General, Criminal Division, U.S. Department of Justice
**15:22 EST** -- Ramen: "Any criminal use of virtual currency systems will be aggressively prosecuted"
**15:25 EST** -- Ramen: Discussing the prosecution of e-gold, Liberty Reserve and Silk Road
**15:26 EST** -- Ramen: "We are working closely with Emerging Virtual Currencies Working Group" to prevent abuse and illegal activity
**15:27 EST** -- Ramen: "We will ensure we have the proper tools" to ensure virtual currencies are not used for illegal purposes. 
**15:28 EST** -- Next witness: Edward W. Lowery III | Special Agent in Charge, Criminal Investigative Division, U.S. Secret Service, U.S. Department of Homeland Security
**15:33 EST** -- Lowery listed various cyber criminals the Secret Service has caught.
**15:34** -- Sen Carper: Is the evolution of the internet similar to bitcoin?
**15:35** -- Shasky: Criminals will always use technology for evil. We need balance regulation with burdens placed on lawful actors.
**15:36** -- Ramen: Virtual currencies are not illegal but are still subject to AML and KYC. She didn't really answer the question.
**15:37** -- Lowery: The Secret Service is constantly adapting to changing threats.
**15:40** -- Sen Carper: Some people see Bitcoin as the future of criminal activity. How confidant are you that we can deal with criminal activity that could result from bitcoin?
**15:41** -- Lowery: Criminals now have a wider reach. "That has changed how we enforce our laws... There are plenty of cyber criminals in jail right now that would agree we are effective"
**15:43** -- Sen Carper: How can the legislative branch support the executive branch in prosecuting cyber criminals?
**15:44** -- Ramen: We can be effective by working together like we did with the Liberty Reserve and Silk Road prosecutions. Law Enforcement is both "nimble and aggressive"
**15:45** -- Ramen: Law Enforcement needs to innovate just as criminals innovate. 
**15:46** -- Shasky: "The Bank Secrecy act and USA Patriot Act has already given us a strong platform" to prosecute cyber criminals.
**15:48** -- Carper: What are some examples of digital currencies helping consumers?
**15:50** -- Shasky: Stored value cards, ACH, online banking. No mention of Bitcoin. "Cash is still the best medium for laundering money"
**15:52** -- Carper: Do virtual currencies, including Bitcoin, fit inside our regulatory framework? Are there any gaps?
**15:54** -- Lowery: Cyber criminals have *not* by and large gravitated to decentralized or peer-to-peer currencies like bitcoin. 
**15:56** -- Ramen: There needs to cooperation between regulatory agencies and law enforcement agencies. 
**15:58** -- Ramen: "I feel confidant that currently the statues that we have have been effective thus far"
**15:58** -- Ramen: "Money laundering statues can be updated"
**16:02** -- Sen Carper: How do new types of currencies fit into the tax system? What is the new guidance? 
**16:03** -- Everybody punts.
**16:04** -- Sen Carper: Who decides if virtual currencies are actual currencies?
**16:06** -- Shasky: We want to protect the US financial system. The regulatory framework has the ability to flex with the landscape.
**16:07** -- Sen Carper: After Silk Road was shut down, many popped in its stead. How do we deal with these sites? Are they more difficult to respond to?
**16:08** -- Lowery: 3 infrastructures used by cyber criminals: Boards and dark sites, digital currency, "Bullet proof hosting" (hosting in countries outside of US legal reach)
**16:10** -- Ramen: Hidden services are a challenge to LEAs but we are keeping pace. "It is important to send a message to the users of those that sites that they cannot trust those sites... law enforcement is watching"
**16:12** -- Sen Carper: Virtual currencies may leave the US and move to countries with easier regulatory frameworks. What can we do to keep that business here?
**16:13** -- Shasky: "If businesses leave because of a regulatory burden, they will find that advantage short lived." "If virtual currencies are going to be a real player... regulation is going to happen. It has to happen." "I think the innovation and jobs will stay, or at least come back, to the US."
**16:15** -- Ramen, closing statement: "We intend to be as aggressive [as we have been] and we intend to keep pace"
**16:17** -- Lowery, closing statement: "It is going to take consistent awareness of the growing threat" "We believe aggressive law enforcement is part of a well functioning country"
**16:20** Shasky, closing statement: Our goal is "mitigating the risk [of bad actors] while minimizing the burden [to consumers]" Fincen wants those involved in virtual currency to do three things 1) Register with Fincen 2) Put in place AML mechanism 3) Maintiain records and provide that information Fincen including SARs
**16:23** -- Sen Carper: Regulation gives us clean air and clean water. We can have both a strong economy and not facilitate criminal activity.

Don't tell her about your BTC riches, those are irrelevant to her.
When you have USD in the bank, is the time to drop that ~~bomb~~ surprise. (If ever)
Personally I don't tell my women much about our financial situation. I just tell her what our target budget is for XYZ and we try to keep to it. She has noticed that there is a lot more money to play with recently, and she has an inkling that it comes from the "internets" but she doesn't understand or really care very much.
It really is a function of the dynamics of your relationship. But a good rule of thumb is not to run your mouth about hypothetical riches.
