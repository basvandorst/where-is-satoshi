You are correct.  I am wrong in calling it a libertarian movement.  But there were many libertarian leaning people involved in the early days before the social justice warriors came in, just in the same way there were many libertarians involved in the original tea party movement (Anti Bush TARP days) before that got hijacked by Fox News \ NeoCons

Occupy Wall Street was originally a libertarian movement.  Its original purpose was to hold the wall street executives and bankers responsible for the Great Recession. The liberal media hijacked the movement and made it a "leftist movement".   
A lot of early bitcoiners were involved with Occupy.

Relevant Story:  One day in high school, I was coming out of the restroom when I'm grabbed by school security and thrown to the floor.  They ask me where the "stuff" is at.  I tell them I don't know what they are talking about but they keep pressuring me by telling me that someone ratted me out, they know I have it on me, and I should tell them where it's at.  I tell them they're crazy and they have no right to be treating me like that.
They start searching me without my consent.  Of course they find no drugs on me because I wasn't a dealer.  But they do find a plastic square device.  One security holds it up in the air and yells at my face "How do you explain this huh?!!"  He held up my TI-89 assuming it was a digital scale used to weigh drugs I presume.  I respond with, "That's my graphing calculator... I'm in AP Calculus."  At that point he kind of realizes he's a dumbass, but still yells at me telling me "I know it's you. I'll be watching you!!" before letting me go back to class.

I work in a computer repair shop and have encountered this virus many times.  
  
1. Download, burn, and run  (make sure to update before running)   
2.  Go into computer in safe mode by pressing F8 and then selecting safe mode with networking. 
3. Run Roguekiller (by tigzy) Run scan and then click on delete files   
4. Run Malwarebytes   
5. Run Combofix 
These are all free programs that will get rid of the ransomware virus. The whole process usually takes 2-4 hours.  
  
Don't ever pay these fucks, it just gives them an incentive to keep creating more viruses/malware.

Papa Johns did shitty this quarter.  Most of their advertisement $ goes to a partnership they have with the NFL.  When earnings results came and they didn't do as well as they were supposed to, the CEO blamed it on the NFL kneeling fiasco which is technically true.  
  
You see: kneeling caused NFL viewership to go down and less viewership equals less people viewing papa johns advertisement, therefore less people buying pizza.
    
The media spinned this as Papa Johns is anti NFL protest!! Making liberals or just people who are pro-protest mad.  
I've heard the dude is douche from people who have met him in person, but this was just him giving a reason for shitty numbers during a quaterly earnings call.  A reason that is probably technically true.

I submitted this 4 and a half years ago.  had approximately 10k users. This was during the first hard fork caused by BIP 50. There was a huge panic.  People were saying they knew bitcoin was a bubble all along.  Bitcoin was bound to crash and fail. That bitcoin holders were idiots for not selling at the ATH of $48.   
Here we are 4 years, from $4900 to $3300 instead of ($48-$32) a 100x fold increase. There is still FUD going around and weak hands are still panicking, but us that have been here long enough will just HODL and enjoy the ride ;)

There is a big chance the price could crash and you would feel very dumb for a while.  It is extremely rare for you to time the market at just the right time to get in at the current bottom.  But if you're okay with taking that risk and possibly feeling dumb for a few months/years until the price comes back up, then I would say take the risk.  It's been worth it for me and many hodlers, not to mention some of us truly believe this is gonna revoloutiize the world.  But always remember, don't invest more than you can afford to lose.  Good luck.

Good points.  They would have to do an attack now while it's still in it's infancy.  Basically we need more miners with more asics and more everyday users to realize the benefits and fight for their right to this technology (like they did with SOPA and PIPA) if it ever came to it.

It's a compounding increase (just like interest) is what I meant to say.  6% is the average daily increase during that period, but it is not the rate of increase.
@_date: 2013-04-06 19:16:40
Bitfloor has usually always been +0-5% higher than mt. gox.  I'm assuming it's due to easily being able to get your money in, smaller trade fees, and less available supply.  
It doesn't matter if you pay a higher premium to buy since you will most likely get a higher premium when you sell, so don't worry about it ;D
@_date: 2013-07-02 19:38:45
Interest compounds. You can't just 900%/150 = 6%/day.
Don't have exact numbers, but if the difficulty was about 2,500,000 in February, an average daily increase of 1.45% would get it to its current rate.

An attacker that controls more than 50% of the network's computing power can, for the time that he is in control, exclude and modify the ordering of transactions. This allows him to:
    Reverse transactions that he sends while he's in control. This has the potential to double-spend transactions that previously had already been seen in the block chain.
    Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
    Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks 
@_date: 2013-02-03 02:04:44
I think your estimate of $40M is too high considering Avalon's first batch cost them &lt; 390k (300 x $1,300).  And even at $40m, that's like what? 1.6% out of ONE days worth of the defense budget.

@_date: 2013-02-02 23:52:27
Can you explain to me how you came to this conclusion?  As I see it, If Avalon had kept all 300 initial units (300 x 66 Gh/s = 19.8 Th/s) they would have had 46.5% of the total network hashrate.  If a small company with limited funds is able to do this, I don't see why a government or big corporation couldn't.

In her defense, it's pretty hard to explain how bitcoin works with a one sentence response.  I'm sure if she would have gone into more detail, the other two would have been even more confused and skeptical.  
@_date: 2013-02-02 23:30:32
Wouldn't be too hard considering how a small company like Avalon was able to impact the hashrate so much.  I believe that single rig they've delivered is about 0.3% of the whole network now.

You are mistaken.  There was a strong libertarian presence in the early occupy movement.  The occupy movement was supposed to be anti-corporate (crony capitalism) not anti-capitalism.  The Media manipulated it and made it into a liberal movement in the same way the media and neo-cons hijacked the tea party.

Agree on the thought that we need to distribute more ASICs out to more miners.
"An attacker with more than 50% can:
Prevent some or all transactions from gaining any confirmations
Prevent some or all other miners from mining any valid blocks"
This is what I'm afraid of.  That's basically Denial of Service right there.

 shows a distribution pie graph.  It shows most of the hashrates coming from mining pools like BTC Guild, Slush, and Deepbit.  I don't know about the accuracy on this graph though, and another interesting thing to point out is the ~25% unknown on that graph.
