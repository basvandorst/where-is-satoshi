Dude I suggest Binance more walls @ lower prices = less increase in price. You will lose $ by selling your BTC to CNY and then increase the fuck out of GAS in 19800 and lose $ do they even have enough supply right now in 19800?

Btw 19800 does not accept BTC, so you'll have to exchange your BtC to another currency to then exchange to CNY to then exchange to GAS when you can do BtC to GAS in Binance. Good luck dude.

Are brokers like coinbase providing 1099-B's? Are they reporting the proceeds and cost basis to the IRS?

I heard that this was BS. The post on medium that I read said that Institutions send wire transfers to BFX which will be credited as USDT and then people buy whatever they want with them.

All those coins trade against bitcoin, bitcoin crashes and the rstio goes down. Bitcoin is like an index.

If bcash was getting pumped from tethers there wouldn't be any bitching there.

Ok? Talk to BFX bud, idc.

That's great because these BCH fudsters keep believing that BCH will be massively more profitable and a "flippening" will occur.
