Money is memory and as we know memory is fleeting, hence inflation. Old favors don't matter as much. With bitcoin it's turned upside down, old favors matter more and more in the long term.

The even smarter fiat holders assume that the Central Bank is there to protect the purchasing power of their fiat and will use its tools to do so (after all that's what's it for in the first place).

You can have deflation with any currency (periodically) when the prices for goods are falling as measured in that currency. The Euro-zone can become deflationary despite new money being added to the system at the same time. Likewise you can have periods of inflation with Bitcoin and not just because coins are still being mined. It's enough that prices are falling or rising. At least that's the definition that makes the most sense to me.

I think it would make more sense to start their own currency (same properties as bitcoins). If outsiders buy into it - that's even better because they would be the early adopters of their own currency and benefit from that. With bitcoins it's almost like bringing back colonialism (considering who the early adopters of bitcoins are).

I've only started seriously researching Bitcoins since yesterday (I first heard about them on Slashdot years ago). I have to say for me the two biggest issues are:
1. What happened to Liberty Dollar and e-gold, that is those currencies were promptly shut down by the government as soon as they got popular enough.
2. It has many hallmarks of an internet fad. It's like believing Ron Paul will become the president of the US, or that Pirate Bay is safe because it's in Sweden, or that Wikileaks founders, donors and sources are off limits.
I just don't see how one can seriously expect Bitcoins to become a mainstream currency when creating your own currency is basically illegal in many parts of the world and these kinds of operations were shut down in the past. As soon as Bitcoins generate enough buzz in the media, say when a couple of big websites start using it (such as this one), all it takes is one notice from a government agency hinting to the effect that Bitcoins are illegal. Worded in a non binding way then picked up by the media who will link it directly to Bitcoin - and it's over. All trust is lost. Legitimate businesses will have no choice but to drop Bitcoin support. While authorities work out how to go after Bitcoin given its decentralized nature (and don't kid yourself, they will find a way even if it means taking over the network with supercomputers).
Now if we step back and look at the big picture. Suppose the powers that be and the people decide that Bitcoin is what they want. Won't they create a competing currency using similar technologies but on their own rules? Of course they would and Bitcoin with it's 21 million coin limit goes out the window.
I guess the best possible outcome is Bitcoin becoming some kind of universal virtual world currency used in games etc. Maybe they wouldn't go after it then.
Anyway that's my take. I'd love to hear what I'm missing though because overall I find the idea very interesting.

But the Bitcoin exchange rate can't and won't ever be stable in terms of how much you can buy for it. Remember, it's the very reason why governments left the gold standard in favor of a money supply they can manage. Do we really need to learn this lesson all over again?
Imagine we've already fully switched to Bitcoin. The first crisis hits - and it will at some point, as there will still be resource shortages, natural disasters and most of all incompetent or corrupt governments. What happens then? It's going to be brutal, worse than the Great Recession. No way to provide a soft landing for the unlucky people who find themselves in that situation.
People take the relative price stability provided by the world's reserve currencies for granted only pointing to what they don't like about Central Banks. A few dollar jump in gas prices over a year is considered huge news. Now you've got Bitcoins and not even a slightest idea how much gas you'll be able to buy by the end of this year for 1 Bitcoin. That economy would be a nightmare, nothing can be planned with this kind of volatility (inflation ordeflation).
So to me: short term investment - fine (lot's of other quasi pyramid schemes to choose from BTW).
Underground currency - fine (well, not really...).
Convenience currency for small payments - fine.
Building an economy on Bitcoins - big no, no.

I believe this is a flaw of bitcoin and it has to do with the distribution model which favors early adopters too much. On the other hand, bitcoin needs to be viral if it is to succeed somehow without being forced on people. It's hard to balance this.

Is this a joke? That guy uses double spaces after periods on his blog. Just like Satoshi did:

So what's the mystery here? Satoshi himself credits the authors of b-money and bitgold as the original inventors of bitcoin-like crypto-currency. We should be doing interviews with those guys.
As for Satoshi, he's the skilled programmer who implemented the system and started mining coins. He could be anyone.

Store of value backed by what? If it's no good as a medium of exchange then there isn't much value in it. It has to be good as a currency if it is to have any real value, otherwise it's just a collectible item. 
Then again a good currency is first and foremost stable as the traditional thinking goes (Swiss government spending 1/3 of GPD trying to keep their currency from rising). Bitcoins are inherently deflationary in the adoption phase as the numbers of users grow faster than new Bitcoins are generated. Perhaps the distribution model is flawed?

Gold is hard to find also because most of it sunk deeper below surface when our planet was forming (gold is heavy). So there is some truth to that asteroids may contain more gold than you would find near the surface of Earth. But mining it isn't going to happen any time soon when today we can barely drill a tiny hole in a rock on Mars.

If it did, this house of cards would have fallen already. I've watched the last few big price crashes we had recently and they seem to end when the exchange starts badly lagging convincing people that the price stopped falling.
With automatic stop loss sell orders these events would end on the rock bottom.
I was thinking what effect these limitations on trading have: no shorting, no stop loss, no high frequency trading, slow system, not much liquidity, difficulties putting new money into bitcoin (waiting lists) etc. For example whenever some stock exchange threatens to ban short selling, the traders complain how this will only create deeper crashes. Doesn't look that way with bitcoin. I'd even say the limitations have a positive effect, but we'll see.

I doubt Satoshi the coder is necessarily the same person as those who released the scientific paper on cryptocurrency. I would assume it's not. The people behind the paper are clearly academics, they'd have access to students or other faculty members who could write the software for them.

What caused the 2011 bubble anyway? Was it really just a coincidence that it ended with the hacking incident?
@_date: 2013-12-05 18:03:13
It's not a currency and it can't be used as a currency:
"Bitcoin is a specified virtual commodity, it does not have equal legal status with currency, and it cannot and should not be circulated as currency on the market."
It can only be traded as a commodity (bought and sold for Chinese currency). What's so hard to understand about that? Chinese vendors are not allowed to accept Bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-03-28 18:11:50
Each candle represents 1 week, if the price of Bitcoins rose during that week - the candle is green, otherwise it is red. The price is on the right, currently at close to $100. The scale is logarithmic which makes it easy to compare profits. So despite the current mania, as you can see, MORE profits could be made during the 2011 bubble (if you bought low in March and sold high in June 2011), than now.
The bars below the price candles show how much trading volume there was in each week - the numbers are on the left in millions of dollars. As you can see not that many people participated in the 2011 bubble compared to now.
The RSI simply tells us that currently Bitcoins are in an extremely overbought territory (they even colored it red).
This is sort of a standard chart configuration you'd use for long term analysis. The bitcoinity.org charts for example are cute but not nearly as informative.

Yes, that's my point, people get cought up looking at historical fiat currency inflation (USD) and don't seem to realize how much the Central Banks (not just the US) have actually done to keep the prices stable during the current crisis. After all, meeting price stability targets is one of the priorities of Central Banks. We can argue that actual inflation is a little higher or some other statistic is a little off, but this is still much less volatile than what a currency like Bitcoin could ever hope for. And controlled inflation is healthy for the economy (you should be earning interest on your savings). It's definitely not enough to point out that something cost 10x less decades ago.
Take China for example - a known currency manipulator already. With their trade surplus and centralized government able to do this, why wouldn't they push Bitcoins to wherever they wanted? Internally they'd force their citizens to use government issued currency like they do now anyway. Soon you'd find yourself easly gamed for profit without any recourse. Today you are protected by the most powerful Central Bank in the world. It would make no sense at all to give that up.

If you look up [private currency]( you'll find a few more examples. It's probably going to depend on the scale of circulation and who the intended recipients are. But more than likely they will get you on charges relating to what the currency was used for. Of course without a central issuer this makes things more complicated but it's more than enough to do real damage in the areas of trust and perceived legitimacy.
And that's all it takes, compare that to how they nailed Assange or the Pirate Bay trials. It's impossible to win cases like that just by betting your luck on your belief in basic freedoms.

Well, it's like the Cypriots can't get a break. Running away from Cyprus banks only to suffer a similar fate here.

A bubble is like a partial pyramid scheme then - there is some intrinsic value but the rest of the price is speculation. Of course that's just like the stock market for example.
The question is: are the calls to evangelize the masses about Bitcoins (documentaries, spamming articles with positive comments, advertisements, infographics and so on) - similar to the work Mr. Ponzi would do himself, or are these really growing the intrinsic value of Bitcoins?
And the second question is what is the ratio of "believers" to "investors"?

That's my second point. Internet fads don't translate well into the real world. There's a hard limit on how far they can penetrate the general public's opinion.
Real money was spent on Ron Paul's campaign - and that's fine if you want to promote the cause. But investing in Bitcoin is more like that billionaire trying to buy the elections, except you're still betting on Ron Paul and not Mitt Romney.

And it just might also explain the need for anonymity - you don't want your new currency to be linked to P2P software such as eDonkey.
But I still think the person who had the original idea for Bitcoin was that Irish professor as speculated here:
That doesn't mean they wrote the software themselves.
@_date: 2013-03-21 18:02:21
I don't think it's going to reach a plateau and stay there. Instead it will grow as long as it can and then it will go through a correction. That's what typically happens with shares and commodities. The scale of the correction depends on the size of the preceding growth. There's a general rule that the correction happens about twice as fast as the growth.
But who knows, with Bitcoin's limited liquidity and the relative immaturity and cumbersomeness of the trading platforms it could be very different. Consider two things: the protocol can only handle 7 transactions per second total and a single giant sell order can take ALL the money out of the market (on one exchange) before any other transactions can even take place.
So I'd say there will be crash soon (weeks?) and the price will momentarily drop something like 10 fold. What happens next depends on what triggered the sell-off. If it's just because the price reached $100, a recovery will be fast, if it's a flaw in the system it could be the end. If the government says something it could go either way.

Where do you see that? Most transactions are tiny, too small to be part of a bigger buy. With small sums invested people are more likely to accept even a big percentage loss.
