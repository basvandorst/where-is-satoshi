|The lesson here is that companies that aren't ready to accept Bitcoin and aren't ready to educate customer service about how it works shouldn't even begin accepting bitcoins as they make both themselves and Bitcoin look bad.

I was just reviewing this practice, and while technically possible, it only really works if you can get a miner to clear their mempool / push your broadcast. If you try and broadcast a double spend it will get rejected by the nodes.
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:29:38
|It is impossible to have 2 transactions in the same time when its a chain of transactions right? Or am I missing something?
Unconfirmed transactions (with really low fees, when the mempool is not empty) SIT in the mempool, miners can clear their mempool/push a second transaction which would be picked up first if the fee is higher. They can do this a bunch of times. As you pointed out multiple blocks exist with the same transactions, only the miner who wins the block puts their transactions in. But its not just one block, it can be a few blocks before 'longest chain' is considered longest. 
The 51% becomes really hard after multiple blocks. The greater hashpower, they could change the older blocks by rehashing the transactions.
Solving the block is just a POW (proof of work) function. If you have greater hash power without the difficulty adjusting, yes you can find blocks really fast. They would just turn their miners on (probably right after a difficulty change), and mine a bunch of blocks with their transactions in them, making it the longest chain. It would be noticeable. 
[This is a pretty good watch.](
Why isn't it happening? 'Governments' don't think, people do. Someone would have to propose this to their government. They would have to have a reason. It's going to cost quite a bit of money, may not be successful, and really doesn't accomplish anything, as crypto is more of an idea. They are not going to make money as it would cause a crash. 
Also really hard to manufacturing to keep up. The world market for hashing processors is crazy. The more they buy the higher those prices get too.
Who knows... Attacking these networks is encouraged, we learn a lot.

You've verified the receiving address is in your receiving address list? It should confirm very quickly. What version of electrum are you using? You could try reinstalling. (Make sure you have your seed)

Actually I'm not sure. I just had to do this and did it with mycelium, you can click on the transaction and bump fee from the menu.
It is also available from the command line in core. 
So you might have a point, depending on which keys you have, sender or receiver, and which method is needed rbf or cpfp. cpfp doesnt work since he doesnt have the receiver keys, and rbf only works if you select it when you send (??) so he has to double spend it somehow before it gets confirmed.

Electrum = Bitcoin
Electron Cash = Bitcoin Cash
Different coins. Coinbase has your BCH if you had BTC in your account before Aug 1st. They will give them to you next year. 
You can not directly trade BTC and BCH. You have to exchange though an 'exchange'. You open electrum, send btc to an exchange, they send you 'X' coin to your 'x' wallet.
Wallets generate lots of addresses for privacy. When you sent them from coinbase to your wallet, you made a transaction on the blockchain to a new address. You control that address and the private keys. Your old coinbase address is controlled by coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-31 21:14:26
I'm not sure that it was hash power in this case, [Fork.lol]( shows the hash rate has been stable for the last few days, ~90%. There were a huge amount of transactions during this bull run. Stuffing the blocks. Blocks can be found (on average) every 10 min. If you look at specific blocks you will see the times vary greatly, but every 2016 blocks the difficulty of finding a block adjusts to keep it around 10 min.
If you look close, it happens all the time, but from a distance it averages out.

He already paid a high fee. He sent another tx with a high fee and it confirmed already, multiple confirmations. It should have been picked up by now. The tx log looks kinda crazy but he paid 506 sat... hmmmm

The fee was way too low.
@_date: 2017-08-31 19:14:34
1.) Yes
2.) Yes
3.) Yes, but import loads the old private keys, sweep moves them (at a fee) to a new address created in the wallet.
4.) The public address/private keys will probably be just fine without doing anything. From time to time it would be good to check what network upgrades are happening and how they relate to your stored coin. If for instance you had bitcoin prior to Aug 1, 2017, you will have equal BCH (bitcoin cash) due to a soft fork of the software protocols. If you didn't know about this, you wouldn't have access to them. Wallet software gets updated often with new features. Most of the time you will not have to take action, but being aware is a good thing.
5.) It's not ready for that on large scale. It worked for a while when the userbase was low, but solutions are being worked on.
6.) A fee is a fee, you pay a fee to park your car. You can pay it at the parking meter for 25 cents or at the garage for $35. Fees make it easier to get confirmed faster. Otherwise a low fee is fine and you can wait. If we scale as mentioned above, who knows how much or how fast things can take place.
7.) Yes
8.) If you have a $20 bill, and you want something that is $10, you have to give the 20 to the person, and get 10 back. Same with bitcoin, you have to give over the amount and split it if you don't have exact change. So the change is sent to a new address depending on the software you use.

If you are using electrum all you need is the seed (List of words) to make your backup. You shouldn't export your keys like that. You can do it, but its for when you want to import them to a different wallet. Keep your words and you will be fine!
@_date: 2017-08-31 18:44:12
BCH and BTC addresses are the same. Shapeshift has the private keys for the refund address.
Your BTC was sent to the BTC (You sent bitcoin to another bitcoin address)  receiving address, which they have the BCH private key. They will have to extract this key and manually do a transaction. 
You haven't touched your BCH, download electron cash, or other BCH wallet, and import your seed. This will import your BCH which you can then use shapeshift to send to a BTC address you own.
Do it right this time!
@_date: 2017-08-25 22:13:33
[Looks like it can be done if you edit it offline and refresh so you can make sign and broadcast a new tx. 9 months old info. ] (
I would grab my private key, go offline, install electrum, import key, sign and pay higher fee, go online, broadcast. I'm not sure if this will work or not for double spending since it wasn't broadcast with rbf. If that didn't work I would try building the transaction in core console I guess.

You can try and use NMAP to figure out whats going on.
Incoming connection needs to request an IP and a port.
Router needs to send port request to internal ip address.
Internal IP (the pc with the node on it) must accept incoming connections on that port.
If your firewall is off, you know its not the PC. You need to make sure you can connect to something inside your network, so an idea would be to quickly setup a small apache server and connect to it. Then you can go from there.

Generated address and keypairs have nothing to do with which chain.  If SS has the BCC keypair, they have the BTC keypair. its the same exact large number keypair. Shapeshift doesnt have to generate the address * they've already done it.
It was a BTC to BTC transaction. SS has the private key. They extract it from their BCC wallet, and import it to a BTC wallet and send it back. It's not hard, depending on how SS stores their keys. It is not normal procedue, but 'try to generate' and 'have to generate' dont make any sense.

Fees are too high. The network will not work with fee's like this. People will choose other options. The blocks can go 25 min, and then 2 within the next 10 min, so its not like its going to be 25 min 25 min 25 min blocks right??
Wallets are telling people to pay high fees, which causes the next users to pay high fees. The fee calculations are flawed.
The spam in the 0-30 fee block is killing us, and raising fees.
High fees are TERRIBLE for bitcoin. The network works fine with low fees just as well as it does with high fees. (It does what it does) but we lose users, market cap, etc when the options on the market are better than bitcoin. 
Are you trying to tell people to accept the calculated fee, things are fine, this is bitcoin?
Bitcoin has a scaling problem. The users need to accept that right now. If that means paying low fees and having to wait for confirmations, so be it. Let the spam attackers pay the fees, don't be a sucker.
Wallets have influience. They have influience on what upgrades attach to the network, and the fees we pay. 
Like segwit? Download a segwit enabled wallet.
Like sending low fees and waiting, Download a custom fee wallet.

You can try and double spend it by reloading your private keys into another wallet like electrum and spend the current fee (510 satoshis/byte) to get included in a block faster, or just wait until the mempool empties.
If you hold the receiving address keys you can cpfp, paying a higher fee for a small transaction that will push the previous one through. you have to have money at the receiving wallet though i believe.

Owning the private keys is a good idea. Nothing Coinbase does has to be on-chain. Nothing any exchange does has to be on-chain.
They hold bitcoin in their account, why do you think that is. Control is one of the highest selling points of bitcoin. You eliminate all of the technological benefits when holding with an exchange.
Claiims against Coinbase will probably rise over time. "Oh no someone stole all my bitcoins from coinbase." Imagine it happens to you, what do you do or say to convince them it was their fault and re-credit you. Do you really feel like you are protected there?
@_date: 2017-08-31 23:57:16
The coinbase mobile wallet? That is run from their servers. If you would like to keep your coin in your own wallet you can try mycelium for a phone, or electrum for desktop.
It's probably fine in coinbase, but its really up to you. I would say to leave it there in coinbase until you understand how wallets work. You can still download mycelium or another wallet to see how they work. Once you are more comfortable you can send them to yourself.

Depends on when they grabbed the private key. There are multiple ways to create a paper wallet. Just a public and private key, or a public and encrypted key,, just a public key, etc...
Unless you downloaded something back then that grabbed it, I'm pretty sure they took it. Took a quick picture while you were distracted or made a copy.

That is why most people say don't keep your bitcoin/money on an exchange. It's hard if you are active trading, but if you are a holder its a good idea to get it off. You have to trust an exchange, so people only use exchanges in their own country to withdraw USD (for instance) so they have somewhat a safer experience. 
Bitfinex is an example of an exchange that used to allow USD but no longer does. You can transact on the exchange, but must withdraw in crypto if you are in the US.
When you send to the exchange, they hold the private keys and choose what access to give you in the future.
Atomic swaps may hold the future to this problem, no exchange needed.

The bias is strong in both camps. If their DAA works, they should be able to mine at ~10 min no matter the percentage of miners. Bitcoin was adopted too fast for the current capacity. I have to wonder how we will reach a difficulty adjustment if they have all the hashpower. It would take a long long time to clear this mempool and retarget. Some are choosing to fight the popularity contest instead of a technical one. I think I've come to re-enforce the idea of holding, even forked coins. (Don't dump em) It will take time but they will have the same capacity problems when the time comes. The older your coins are the better chance you have at surviving any fork.

People are stupid and will pay it. It's their own fault. But we have to speak up and demand better from our wallets, even if it means letting these idiots know the tx pool their dealing with is huge and even with a large fee they might not be in the next block, so a smaller fee is probably okay.

Each address has a private key, so if there were more addresses created, its just for the empty ones.
When you create a wallet, depending on the wallet, it creates a few receiving addresses. When you send BTC ( like handing over a $20 to pay for a $10 charge, you get $10 back.) you send over the amount, and receive the change to a new address. Otherwise all your transactions could be tracked by everyone you send money to.

Some wallets (Hardware or software) work with multiple coins. Some are just for single coins. You have to find what you are looking for. It might not exist (A specific bitcoin/ripple wallet for example) . 
Coinbase has a mobile app, but it is not a wallet, it is just access to your online coinbase coins. 
For bitcoin there are many options. For other coins, they don't have the dev team so there are not as many options. For many of those coins you will need to download a wallet onto a computer, they don't even have a mobile option. 
Some of these wallets require you to download that coins specific blockchain. This can get really large on your computer. 
I don't (DO NOT) suggest that you download all these wallets.
Get a bitcoin wallet, and send yourself a small amount so you learn how to use it. Leave everything else on the exchange or convert it to bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-23 05:45:38
Yes BCC and BTC private keys are the same. The same key unlocks either chain. You have to work with them separately though.
BCC = Electron Cash
BTC = Electrum
You need the list of private keys. You will have more keys/address combos, some with 0 coins on them. You only need the keys for the ones that have coins at that address.
Keep asking questions and I'll keep trying to assist.

Not sure if you figured it out, click receive on mycelium and that address is the one you will put into coinbase to send to. You don't have to transfer all of it either, you can just send yourself a few bitcoin to see it in your wallet.
After you send yourself some bitcoin, you will see that it gives you a new address. This is normal behavior. When someone else sends you bitcoin, you don't want to have to give them the address you used elsewhere, so it generates a new one.
Make sure NOW to backup your mycelium wallet. It will give you a list of words, write them down and store them safely. (Somewhere good for YEARS if needed, lots of people lose it.)
With the seed words, you don't have to do anything else. If you lose your phone, you can download mycelium on a new phone and put those words in. You might want to set a pin on mycelium as well so if you lose your phone its harder to spend.

@_date: 2017-09-16 08:43:31
I would not assume so. 
I usually just import the single key or keys when creating a wallet.
Your appdata folder has the electrum installation. I just delete it, and run electrum from my download folder (saving the seed first). It reinstalls and creates that directory again. This allows you to make new seeds, or import seeds, or import keys. You can also just rename that directory if you want to keep a bunch of different seeds for whatever reason. 
You can do the same thing with a mobile wallet as far as new wallet/seed creation. Download mycelium, save the seed, delete, reinstall, etc... 
Then send them to an address I have from a wallet I've made, instead of trying to combine a key to a seed wallet. You really want to make sure you have the keys to all your addresses and could easily lose something if you combine them and don't have a backup. 
Bottom line, make sure you have the seed. It's not a good idea to work with single keys.
@_date: 2017-09-06 21:45:37
Sure. Paying 'real' money you had to work for, toward a virtual object that no one in the world cared about except a bunch of Magic the Gathering nerds... $1 $10 or $100 seemed crazy.
If you have no savings, spending any money on something like this was 1000% risky. Even at $100/BTC, think about how hard it would be to have enough money to buy more than a few, if one.
So many people don't have access to an extra $100. The earlier you buy in, the better returns you get, but at almost any price now its still highly difficult to own more than a few coins for the average person.
@_date: 2017-09-16 10:42:08
Reload = reinstall.
You can rename the folder in your /username/appdata folder or delete it if you have the seed saved.
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:34:13
NO. They are different chains and work off different servers. They all have the same keys and addresses on both networks so its possible to make a mistake, and easy to do so. If you are using electrum already, there was concern about ElecTRON cash copying the data from your electrum folder. You could go to your %AppData directory and rename the electrum folder or delete it if you have the seed before working with Electron Cash, and remove it when you are done.
This isn't optimal because if it has malware of any kind, its going to be installed. Some people run a virtual OS, or a live session off a USB to keep their system clean. It's up to you.
There are some other mobile wallets that work with both coins, but be careful. I didn't have any problems this way.

Okay I'll try to explain it:
1.) It depends if you are creating a new wallet or if you have a wallet already. If you start electrum you can import just the key/address, or a group of keys. If you already have a wallet, and import, it will store that key for you. BUT That key is not backed up with the new wallet seed. its only stored locally. if you sweep it to that wallet, it should send it to one of your addresses you have in that seed.
3.) import the private key TO A BCH wallet, not a BTC wallet.
You are doing a transaction yes, from a single key to a seed key.
Security is complex. Some people are worried about tying all your transactions together in a more traceable way. (If you've made a bunch of transactions, all your change addresses will be pulled and combined.)
Thats the only risk I can give any advice on.
@_date: 2017-09-23 16:12:28
|it doesn't show a balance the same way the first BCC wallet does, and the addresses it shows are all different, 
I'm confused a little by your wording.  Can you expand? If you checked the blockchain and see the address with your BCC, and have the key for that address, you should be able to load it up and send it. I would say Red is an OUTPUT/SENT transaction.

Your coins are not stored on your wallet, they are stored on the blockchain. the 2x might split the blockchain. so some servers will mine for one and some wont.
If your wallet updates for both chains, you would be able to use it to send on both chains.
If your wallet does not update for both chains, you need the private keys from your wallet, so that you can use other software to make the proper transaction on both networks.
The split means that the moment of the fork, your coins are available on both networks, but have the same address/private keys.
does that help?

It is not a stupid question, You should know how this works properly.
Coinbase is online, so you only need the username/password. They do the address change for you. You can go see your old addresses in your account.
Old addresses are OKAY to send to. They will work fine. Not the best way to use bitcoin though. It makes it traceable to everyone you spend to. They can see how many bitcoin you have, etc. HD wallets make a new address, so that new people don't see your wallet balance.
If you download your own wallet to your PC or PHONE you will need to back it up safely.
If you have the SEED (12 words, or however many your wallet tells you to write down) you get all the addresses safely.
Ask more questions if you have them!
You can download a wallet and play with it first. Try to understand it before you send any money to it, or only send a little bit.

Normal behavior. Wallets are not like your checking or savings account. The receive address changes each time, then when you go to send they send from those receiving addresses. You just need to make sure coinbase says you have 1 BTC or whatever you sent.
(If you want to know a little more, imaging having a $20 bill and you buy something for $10. You must hand over the $20 and receive $10 in change. When you send bitcoin it looks for addresses with close to that amount you want to spend, but more than it, and sends the change to a new receive address in your wallet.) You can do this with the same address, but then anyone you send money to can see all of your transactions. So new addresses are used.

You have Bitcoin Cash equal to the Bitcoin you owned in a private wallet before Aug 1, 2017.
Even if you've spent bitcoin since then, and you still have the keys for your addresses, you can receive the bitcoin cash coins.
You will need to load your private keys for those addresses into a Bitcoin cash wallet. For the PC you can use ElecTRON cash, or there are a few other options.
Before you do this, you may want to move any existing Bitcoin from your ElecTRUM wallet to a new Seed(new wallet, with new backup).

[BIP39 Word List](
@_date: 2017-10-12 04:26:56
I don't use blockchain.info but here's my input:
Every address has a private key.
Blockchain.info uses multi-sig keys. That can be 2 of 3 or other combinations. If you have two keys, you can spend. If you have one key and they have one key, you can spend. Notice they don't have 2 keys so they can never spend.
1.) Bitcoin cash (BCH) will stay on the address they were on at the time of the old fork, no matter where you send your BTC. Replay protection keeps them from being sent on both networks.
Your login/password are to request blockchain.info to use the third key, or to gain access to your bitcoin for normal use through their site.
You can use the 12 word phrase to recover your bitcoin with other software like 'electrum'. You may need to lookup proper instructions for multi-sig wallets. (Chose to restore a multisig instead of standard).
|Within the next 8 weeks, we’ll be rolling out limited support for BCH via the settings panel in your Blockchain Wallet. Users with balances of bitcoin in their Blockchain Wallet on August 1st will be able to access an equal balance, as of August 1st, of bitcoin cash.
So while they say this, I assume since they don't have 2 keys, they are only giving you access to send them using their site. If you import your seed (12 words) into electrum, you could do this before they give you access. You won't get both though.. it will be the same BCH either way.
Once you get your import done with the BTC, you can use the seed from blockchain on elecTRON CASH to send your BCH elsewhere. (shapeshift to bitcoin!)

How did you put money into crypto? Through an exchange? If you have crypto on an exchange, you would withdraw it to each wallet. So you have a bitcoin wallet, a litecoin wallet, a bitcoin cash wallet, ripple wallet, etc... Some wallets have multiple coins, but be very careful sending only each type of coin to their own wallets. Dont mix anything up. 
You could also leave them there until you understand how they work. You could sell them all and only hold bitcoin, and send that to one wallet, leaving whatever you want to trade on the exchange.
It's up to you, but learn how first.

Yep! If you wanted to try it, you could go to your hidden app folder (c:\users\username\appdata\electrum) and just rename electrum to something else, when you start electrum again it will act like a new wallet, you tell it your seed, and it will fetch all your transactions from the network. You could also just uninstall and reinstall, but if you feel uncomfortable deleting the files its understandable.

Another point: Cash is instant. BTC Sends happen almost instantly. Confirmations can take ~10 min. Credit cards can take 30/60/90 day settlement.
There are protections against double spending that require miners to capitulate. It's difficult! CPFP and RPF are tools that can only be used in certain ways.
So you can send almost instantly, why are you worried about the confirmation? Most timed processors seek the SEND not the confirmation, if they are programmed correctly. Conformations keep going on and on and on forever....
The difficulty is an automatic adjustment every 2016 blocks. It's based on how much mining power is in the total network. The difficulty lowers when miners leave. The lower the difficulty the easier it is to manipulate the block time average by bringing on or taking off miners.
The block reward is already set, who's been trying to modify it?
It's easy to say we need a 5 min block and low difficulty, but what are the consequences? For mining to remain profitable, you need capacity near your userbase. If userbase is larger than capacity, you get slow full blocks. If capacity is larger than userbase you get fast empty blocks.

Even if TrustedCoin is compromised or taken offline, your coins are secure as long as you still have the seed of your wallet. Your seed contains two master private keys in a 2-of-3 security scheme. In addition, the third master public key can be derived from your seed, ensuring that your wallet addresses can be restored. In order to restore your wallet from seed, select “wallet with two factor authentication”, as this tells Electrum to use this special variety of seed for restoring your wallet.
Note: The “restore” option should be used only if you no longer want to use TrustedCoin, or if there is a problem with the service. Once you have restored your wallet in this way, two of three factors are on your machine, negating the special protection of this type of wallet.

When you reinstall electrum or other software (your seed words will work with some other software, its an open standard) it will see that you've sent money to them.

When you move the BTC after the 2X fork it splits into BC1 and BC2. (Similar and same network, until blocks separate.!?42sandwich) You must take precautions so that you have access to the BC2. If you sent coin to pay for something, the receiver would get your BC2 and BC1.

So.. you cant get them until the fork, but when you try to move them it moves both. So splitting them is a different process than it was with BCH because BCH had replay protection. I'm not exactly sure at this point how to split them. They (2X) tried to implement a crappy way of replay protection making you spend 0 to a specific known private key address. If that's the way it turns out, you either have to make a manual transaction to do this, or wait for a developer to make it automatic.

They called it 'bitcoin' + 'gold' so its better? I'm not saying there is logic in their decision, but if you don't know much user GPU mining bitcoin sounds great, or like the original version right?

Not a database: 
Q: So you don't store a database of every single key?
A: No.
Q: All keys are generated on the fly, based upon the page number?
A: Yes.

15 min isnt for confirmation. As soon as you send it, the wallet should see it as unconfirmed, but still see it.

1.) Damntastic!
2.) VerryBetter!
3.) *$2000 open a stock trading account at Fidelity or some reputable trade platform, get index funds or pick a few stocks at random! trade if you really want to lose some money;
$2000 in Bitcoin (Or Bitcoin + Shitcoins) 
*$2000 in Metals? 
*$2000 in Commodity stocks.
*I can get killed in this sub for these type of comments!
The idea is that at least one will rise while the others fall, so overall you gain by saving, adding, and compound interest. If you look at your portfolio and something is above 25%, you can take from it and move it to something that is under 25%...
This is a safe type of investing. Yes you could lose out on a bit of profit, but how would you feel if that $8000 turned into $3600.

Oh I HIGHLY doubt 30% of china is into BTC. That's 300,000,000 (3 hundred million) people. But that also means there are only like 3 people in Nambia who use bitcoin.

Yeah, change address. Should be fine.
@_date: 2017-09-09 00:45:47
Yeah that doesnt really matter, your password only stops spending when you dont have the seed backup words. Those bypass the password. You are fine and can ignore the fact you lost the original password as it isnt needed once you recover from seed.

No thanks, just learn what you are doing before you do it!
I think your coins are fine, we just have to get you to them.
Breadwallet looks like they are still working on BTC/BCH rollout so you may have a bug of some kind. Using the seed with electrum should fix you up.
@_date: 2017-10-12 08:14:51
Any one of those could be printed on a paper wallet and 'work'. You just import the private key into whichever software you're using and it loads it up. Not a great way to use daily, more of a storage use case. Wallets allow change addresses so you have a little more privacy.
*And when you load it into a wallet, it doesn't usually save that private key, so don't lose it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 23:51:49
Your seed is able to generate the private key for all those old addresses, and new ones it creates. Don't hesitate to ask if you have any more questions. Some of us like to help out.
@_date: 2017-10-12 16:44:44
Use the console in Core to dump your private keys, you only need the ones with money on them.
Create a new mobile or PC wallet.
Download electrum
Import keys into electrum.
Send to new BTC address.
Download Electron Cash
Import same private keys.
Send to shapeshift.io to convert form BCH to BTC.

You could install chrome, mozilla firefox, edge, or safari etc. Web browsers all the same, just different companies. 
Wallets are the same way, you can use a PC wallet, a Mobile wallet, or a Hardware wallet like Trezor. Trezor is just the electronics needed to hold/send/receive bitcoin and nothing else. It's kind of like a phone wallet, without the phone.
On the other hand an exchange wallet is not yours. You only have the ability to log into the exchange. So if you have money on an exchange and they shut down, good luck. If you have money on a personal wallet, then you can just send it to an exchange when you need to.

@_date: 2017-10-11 21:26:16
Go to your download folder and sort by date. What did you download ? Do you have teamviewer? Have you allowed anyone remote access? Browser extensions? Somehow your private keys were captured from your computer. I doubt it had anything to do with electrum. Sorry for your loss, at least it was small! 
You should consider your OS infected and start from scratch.
Provide as much info as possible to help others out if you are willing.

I agree with his definition criteria. I believe that's the most common way for a discussion to devolve.
He stepped in his own mess though. Point number 2 needs his definitions of 'intrinsically valuable/valueless.' 
A new tool can be valuable or valueless.
Instead of trying to throw a bunch of examples of possible value of this tool out here, it should be noted that bitcoin is an interesting case where there are now new tools in the financial arena. The value comes from the tools and technical development. If they actually are needed or wanted, they will be adopted.
The OPost was regarding is Bitcoin Fiat. Since Fiat is a concept and not an object, every individual subjectively decides what Fiat is, and then if Bitcoin meets that criteria. There is no objective answer to this question.

If it worked why sell it, use it and be rich. It does not work. If you have bitcoin, your friend is trying to steal it.

In your electrum transaction history, did you verify the sent to address? Can you provide an address/tx id? Have you logged into your blockchain wallet, does it say 3 dollars or 38 dollars?
Is this a bunch of dust transactions? (Did you accumulate tiny amounts of bitcoin?)

Unless you keep getting emails, ignore it. If you do get emails, just put them in your spam folder/block sender. Sometimes your email just gets put on a list and they sucker you into confirming a real email by responding.... If they don't have an automated system dealing with unsubscribe, good luck.
