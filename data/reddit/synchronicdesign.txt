Nikola Tesla primarily.

For instance, say you are standing against a brick wall and there is a heavy wind blowing against you. The wall is not pulling you toward itself to stop you from separating from it, it is an outward push that is keeping your glued to the wall.

Conventional theory states that gravity is a pulling force caused by the mass of an object. I am entertaining the notion that it is instead a wave or 
 electromagnetic force (ala Nikola Tesla's theory) that is pushing us into the surface of the Earth instead, as in my wind/brick wall analogy.

Well gold and silver actually have use beyond their monetary value so they were certainly "real". Paper "notes" and bitcoin, not so much.

No one disputed the Earth was round (Aristarchus worked that out with rods and shadows over 2,000 years ago), no one disputed gravity, just the principles behind it (which I still think is a outside pushing/repelling force, not an internal pulling force. Not sure what this cartoon is trying to say.

Thanks very much :), will give this a try

Just signed up for ChangeTip, not quite sure how it works at the moment, you have to link your virtual wallet to it?
@_date: 2014-11-08 15:50:45
Already have, you from Cambridge too?

Looking forward to the Facebook implementation, wonder how many non Bitcoin users will give this a try. 
Would be great for musicians such as myself to get a little monetary appreciation from listeners and appreciators.

haha cheers man!

haha true unless you go to a shop/supermarket, can get a donut for about £0.40 or just under $1, or a 6 pack for £1. Real donuts filled with jam or custard mind you, not the dodgy American pure sugar flour/icing sugar versions.

Cool, fellow Cambridge Bitcoin user here :), might have to check out these events. Thanks for posting!

Yup, agree entirely. Truly a game changer on many levels in this corrupt and engineered society we are currently in.

Yeah pretty underrated film, nice balance of action cheese and classic conspiracy thriller.
