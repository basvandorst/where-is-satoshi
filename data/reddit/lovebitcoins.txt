So you post about this and then someone starts harassing you? I'm not quite following what is happening.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:48:42
I wonder how many people down-vote this thinking it is just another report on the job posting instead of reading it and seeing you went out and found people to talk with at Capital One Labs and got quotes. Sometimes, I hate people.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:59:38
I think that is implied ;)
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:19:46
If just a percentage of publishers turn this on it will be huge. The mainstream appeal of the publishers in that network is quite vast.
Exciting times!
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:54:01
A bit creepy.
@_date: 2014-07-14 01:46:06
The tweets he is now sending out to the involved parties are pretty legendary actually.
He is basically calling them scum publicly and asking for them to respond.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:14:13
How do we know that all the sponsored stories are actually marked that way?
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:52:26
Lots of people in the general population who only hear what the news reports tell them and many news sources for "muggles" as the author called them hear about the Bitcoin Foundation from the mainstream news and thus associate it and trust it to be a definitive source for Bitcoin shit.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:55:01
I think that Tom guy blogging on Medium is completely right. We shouldn't trust these guys at all.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:37:38
Yeah and it seems like CCN is doing that disclosure. I still don't like the idea that they accept money for articles because we don't know how far it goes but they are being honest about it.
@_date: 2014-07-14 01:57:00
Sites can have advertisements. Sites should have advertisements. That is different from being paid to write something about a company or site.
I have no problem reading, giving my advertising eyeballs to sites that run advertisements. I don't even use AdBlock because I know it is how they pay the bills but this... this is like inexcusable that people support them basically getting paid to write positive things about them.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:13:17
We should be asking for better though. They should be citing the sources they get stuff from.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:17:52
Certainly fascinating as I am new to reddit to learn about that.
Thank you for sharing.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:44:43
Also here is a link to a copy-pasta site where you can see the original since they scraped it already: 
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:04:02
I kind of enjoyed watching your points go down as someone from CCN likely voted your comment down.
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:21:43
I guess, I wasn't aware of that. How does one know they are shadowban though? I just feel like if they were doing that to a lot of people someone would notice.
I'm not saying I don't believe you, anything is certainly possible but I am just confused is all.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:18:53
Very cool stuff you are doing!
@_date: 2014-08-04 23:06:00
Loved watching this be downvoted even though you guys got the official statement before the official blog post came out, ran it before the official blog post came out, and tweeted about it before the official blog post came out.
Great scoop! Even if no one else appreciates it.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:18:55
Same here actually! They  seem to be fast and always cite sources.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:22:58
That is the REAL issue here, they literally memory hole things when they "issue corrections" without even apologizing or stating they modified the article since it first ran.
What else are they sending down the "memory hole"?
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:28:09
I am listening to him on the radio station in the post right now for the first time ever. It is interesting to say the least and he is certainly passionate for sure.
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:23:30
No, they didn't.
Edit: Shouting it a million times doesn't make it true and until Shopify says that this was the case it is just marketing bullshit.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:56:14
My favorite part is where the CEO *originally said* the following below and he quickly removed and deleted it:


I have screenshots if needed. He sends stuff down his memory-hole and hope people never see it, but we do.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:02:29
If I had the skills I would completely do this.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:49:53
Oh, and keep pumping it up because without new people the scam will eventually collapse.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:58:11
This isn't an isolated incident. Not even remotely.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:39:47
 shouldn't have to call them out for them to do that. They should have done it from the start. It wasn't in the original article at all.
Instead of just suddenly adding an attribution suddenly they should apologize and let everyone know they updated the piece instead of just changing it after the fact and making it seem it was always included.
@_date: 2014-08-18 17:58:28
I have seen this same story on several sites now. It is clearly a piece of PR work that is brilliant from GAW but COMPLETE and TOTAL garbage until Shopify actually says that is the reason, until then this is just speculation and seeing it over and over on so many sites just shows that fact checking is completely absent from bitcoin news sites. They should all be ashamed.
EDIT: Anyone can publish a press release, it takes real journalists to fact check them. Something this ecosystem seems to be lacking.
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:21:00
I am fairly certain they said even if it wasn't the administrators why should we trust a site with Bitcoins that has been hacked (if that was the case) and has failed to mention it to anyone. That doesn't bode well. Either way we shouldn't trust them.
Doesn't seem like speculation though. The certificates do match.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:53:14
@_date: 2014-08-13 16:59:41
This is actually a great idea! It would show the real consequences.
@_date: 2014-08-01 21:47:39
Strange, the disclaimer about the update didn't show up in my RSS reader which to me indicates they updated it a third time even.
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:12:04
I'm fairly certain they would have to provide some evidence to get the admins to do that would they not.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:15:42
Do we just take your word for it? Payments for articles are really not classy even if placed in a different section.
Are they at least nofollow?
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:39:44
PayPal has nothing to actually do with this meetup. They just host it as they host many others.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:49:10
Touche sir. Touche.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:47:20
I believe he is putting it in the blockchain and then if some shitty site that claims to be secure is display raw blockchain data it will appear on the site and he will know it isn't secure against XSS attacks. This is only powerful if he publishes which sites aren't protected.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:08:17
He does have NSA and CIA connections i remember reading somewhere because of the Hushmail connection. I believe I read that somewhere at least.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:16:37
I haven't seen this site. Checking it out! Thanks for the tip!
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:20:21
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:02:53
So is in on it?
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:31:07
I think you should and then let this Tom guy know it.
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:09:32
Do you plan on calling out the sites?
@_date: 2014-11-04 18:47:51
Any thoughts from anyone regarding this gem that popped up on Twitter today? 
@_date: 2014-07-30 15:55:56
Another trashy change it without stating you changed it tactic by CoinDesk.
It is quite clear at this point they are shills for a select group of people in the ecosystem.
Say something you don't mean? Oh, no problem CoinDesk will send it down the memory hole and make a "correction" without ever mentioning the change.
Why does anyone trust this site at this point? Changing stories, not citing sources, shilling for "partners", constant positive coverage of companies who are known scams. Botting articles to the front page. It seems the list goes on.
Can someone please explain this to me? Is this the best in Bitcoin journalism?
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:17:28
Look at all of the sites come out and defend each other. Ugh.
So you host stories. Are you a source like PR Web now? It seems disingenuous at best to say because we are like PR Web we can accept money.
@_date: 2014-07-28 02:21:29
Interesting, this seems to be the first one that is trying to debunk the "tall tale" of those sort of posts.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:55:15
Some of the sites are "storing" press releases and marking them as sponsored but I think based on the tweets this guy is now posting he doesn't like that either.
This tweet had a very valid point:
@_date: 2014-11-24 16:45:26
Paid press release: 
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:17:55
Are you defending them?
@_date: 2014-07-30 18:46:39
I think they've got positive network effect honestly. They also seem to have a large sales team going out and pursuing these sort of things.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:53:54
Excellent X-Files reference. Clearly, you must not be.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:51:23
I liked the use of the word muggles in this piece.
If we want muggles to trust Bitcoin why would they trust a foundation that looks the other way regarding hacking?
Was the database leak good? Likely, yes. Is having that sort of thing be acceptable to a foundation who many associate with Bitcoin that are muggles... likely not.
@_date: 2014-11-25 19:11:07
They said they emailed as well though. Hey want to share screenshots of the email as well?
@_date: 2014-08-29 20:13:12
Looks like they paid for coverage or gave them a tip for coverage.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:04:55
I wonder if this was everyone contacted or if others just didn't respond in time or what. Everyone should be asking other sites perhaps?
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:14:14
We need to eliminate the bad players and call them out or else it will bite us in the ass later.
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:32:15
Went to look. 404 error.
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:38:39
When the guy who has been the primary source for all of the documents questions the document it makes you think... and it made me think this one is fake.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:58:42
After they saw this post on reddit they changed it. Memory hole operation. Why would someone trust a site that actively changes shit and doesn't say that they did?
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:24:14
I guess you do have a valid point. Not trying to call them liars.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:42:39
I feel stupid, it took me a minute to remember where I have seen that guy from the cover image of the article... Oh yeah, to catch a predator. That got a chuckle at least.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:25:37
He seems pretty mad. I wonder if he wrote somewhere before and got let go because of not writing a piece for pay or something.
@_date: 2014-11-24 18:49:23
Didn't say he was the CEO. Separate statements. GAW ceo made claims about media blitz. This thread appeared. Didn't say thread was by GAW CEO.
However point out a nonexistant flaw in what I said to discredit me and make your ponzi investments look better.
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:07:10
This is my thinking as well. I think he was using his actual name and I think he realized what a dire mistake it was.
1. You've got emails supposedly obtained illegally.
2. You used your real name so now you've exposed yourself to liable or slander. Even if it is true.
3. You are going up against people who have vast amounts of a currency.
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:17:32
I would like to think that blockchain bloat will be solved at some point. Plenty of very intelligent developers will certainly tackle that issue.
While plenty of companies are stripping away the "best" elements one of the appeals to me of Bitcoin was that it is open source and user driven. What if the users of the vast majority of masses want to see these sort of changes? Would it be against the open principles to not add them?
@_date: 2014-08-03 02:57:58
If that is truly how the email went the statements above from CCN are VERY misleading then.
@_date: 2014-10-28 05:18:15
I loved everything about this.
@_date: 2014-07-31 20:50:59
It wasn't originally. These aren't conspiracy theories. These jerks are doing this nearly everyday, they keep changing stuff and then changing it again, and then again. CoinDesk is really slipping and used to be my favorite but I've been watching them memory hole shit and modify the past without any mention of them doing it until someone calls them out on it.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:13:39
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:19:35
Did you even read the other comments here, I am fairly certain everyone has established they are just ripping everyone else off.
@_date: 2014-08-05 02:30:59
I had never heard of him before tonight but just a quick search shows that he has had over 400 million views on YouTube.
@_date: 2014-07-12 16:54:01
I wouldn't trust the Foundation as far as I could throw some of the members.
@_date: 2014-07-02 16:34:31
Certainly seems the organizers of Cryptolina are lining up some great names!
@_date: 2014-10-28 04:35:46
This looks really, really, really fake.
@_date: 2014-07-04 07:07:50
Tim Draper thinks it will be under 10 years.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:14:41
Very true. I stand corrected.
@_date: 2014-08-25 16:47:38
I certainly find the concept interesting but you bring up valid points regarding the fear of centralization.
I am finding the concepts of counterparty very interesting but they are obviously using the blockchain ledger still.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:46:10
Ahh, thank you for the explanation. I wasn't aware of that back story.
@_date: 2014-08-02 19:41:43
Don't piss off UpDown.bt and the Russian mafia?
@_date: 2014-08-18 18:32:49
How about fact checking before blindly publishing?
Did they pay for this PR hit job? I've seen it on so many sites.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:36:10
No seriously Do I not know a backstory?
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:49:47
I didn't realize he testified to congress on Bitcoin and just had a lot of negative things to say. This made me go from laughing at him to hating him.
@_date: 2014-07-11 23:56:44
I think the author meant the DNS records as reviewed by WHOIS. I'm not sure sadly.
The certificate was installed after April 9th so you are correct in that.
It still begs the question though if the IP address hosted the file, and the file wasn't put up by the admins of UpDown then why should we trust them? That would mean they were hacked and have failed to mention that to anyone.
The whole thing reeks like UpDown was involved but I'm not sure it will ever be proven.
The author does raise an interesting point though, the Bitcoin Foundation does zero verification regarding the companies they allow in. As long as you have the cash it seems you can get in. perhaps they need to change this?
@_date: 2014-07-13 15:08:40
I think he calls people who don't get it muggles.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:21:05
The "Bloomberg of Bitcoin". I'm fairly certain that to earn that title they should be citing sources and not going back later and sending shit down the memory hole by changing things later without saying anything about the "corrections".
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:12:46
I think the issue isn't whose article is better but rather the fact that CoinDesk outright ripped them off without any attribution until someone called them out on it.
Every other "reputable" site at least has the decency to cite the source of the original material.
This is just another time that CoinDesk has done this in a long line of times of them specifically doing it.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:17:47
That is so trashy they changed the headline later. Wow. People still trust them and visit them why? Jesus, tits and God America people.
@_date: 2014-07-29 00:40:57
No press release for this piece went out, this was literally buried and Brian found it on the SWIFT site several days ago, shortly after publishing his story suddenly CoinDesk is also calling SWIFT. They had no idea this SWIFT program was a thing until they saw it on LTB.
@_date: 2014-07-04 07:11:52
I didn't say that it didn't. I was hoping to open a window for you to discuss why you have come to that conclusion.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:21:49
I have noticed they never cover the bad about certain companies. Makes sense.
@_date: 2014-07-02 01:20:29
Can someone explain this? It seems it keeps going wildly up and down for upvoted.
@_date: 2014-07-29 17:14:23
That is how news works, but reputable sites cite sources.
@_date: 2014-07-03 02:30:58
Don't you think the solution is more people just using it for goods and services? Tim Draper seemed pretty long on it today. He did admit that holding is an issue but that as more people adopt it they will spend it and that will decrease that risk.
@_date: 2014-07-14 02:36:16
Thank you for being honest here. I disagree with having a sponsored article section but at least you were honest.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:32:30
Paging You might want to investigate this story ASAP.
@_date: 2015-01-24 17:33:49
Paging You seem to have vanished. Did the questions become overly hard?
