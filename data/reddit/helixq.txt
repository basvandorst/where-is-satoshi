Their arguments are
1. Nakamoto Satoshi means Center Intelligence, fact check Nakamoto means a central point the middle of something and Satoshi refers to wisdom or being wise or Intelligence
2. They are claiming the crypto in bitcoin is ECC and that's the type connected to all the Snowden docs on wikileaks, and while the specific type of ECC in Bitcoin is from Koblitz Curves, all ECC emanates from Koblitz Curves to some degree and Koblitz has almost 50 years of suspicious NSA related activities including developing the development of the whole concept of ECC crypto and his extensive traveling to CIA/NSA hotspots as is documented in his autobiography. Example how is a 20 something year old Harvard kid getting a visa to Russia at the height of the cold war 1968. Also the explanation given by Koblitz in his own bio as to how he got the 10 grand (a lot of money in 1968 when a year at Harvard was only 4K) shows a possible connection to intelligence funding. 
3. Besides Koblitz being connected to Bitcoin crypto, Koblitz was recently hired by Etherum another crypto currency project.
4. Koblitz released days before Satoshi paper on bitcoin his famous I LOVE THE NSA and ECC paper urging everyone to use the crypto now cracked by the NSA.
So they put the pieces together very well and this site has a summary of their work.

See above, their argument is much more than the Japanese CIA name, they show how the crypto creator of Bitcoin ECC PRNG released a big paper on ECC and the NSA just days before he Bitcoin paper appeared, something no one else caught.
