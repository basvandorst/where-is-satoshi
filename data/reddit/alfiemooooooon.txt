If you’ve ever been to a cex store you will know their staff are all nerds, gamers or geeks. Not to offend but to point out the fact that they know exactly what bitcoin is and are most definitely hodling

BBC article you know. This is crazy. Can someone smart explain how bitcoin can help. 
He said; you cannot do business when you start with one rate and end up with another. (Coffee importer in article) 
How can crypto help this? (Considering it is even more volatile than their fiat) 
Another said. Best thing to do is wait. 
This would mean putting business on hold?? Why not just continue to do business but accept crypto instead?
