It is truly amazing how many sockpuppets and paid accomplices BU has answering questions on here. Ver is a dirtbag and almost 100% involved w the government to try to hard fork bitcoin to make it centralized.  He needs to be purged along with the rest of BU.  Jihan must not be supported either

Kiara is a blockstream developer and extremely bright girl.  Unfortunately for good and honest white Americans, a war is being waged against us on all fronts.  Its pretty sad overall that our women are targets but the enemy isnt going to like how this ends

If all the people in the world were using bitcoin you dont think we would have improved scaling by then?

Haha ill check it out

Implying 100 mil is enough to break bitcoin.  This will pass like other attacks. Its large government interference we must fear
@_date: 2017-02-06 19:11:08
Im in the same camp Boombox.  If we HF im out and i have a large amount of my worth in btc.  If bitcoin cant beat Roger Ver and BU and their million sockpuppets spreading misinformation then bitcoin has no chance when governments come after bitcoin.  Although im wholly convinced Gavin and Roger are state actors.  Im not worried about a fork as of now because BU code is trash but blocking Segwit seems to be working as of now and its really all they can do. 
@_date: 2017-02-15 01:40:19
I think you are missing the inflationary aspect of government, manipulable money
@_date: 2017-02-21 03:40:53
I would try with small amounts, it has worked for me.  I only use the account once and with a VPN and changed locations of the server each time.  Its just hard to get coins at a reasonable rate without revealing your identity and this is one way
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:24:32
Cute rhetoric. Its almost as though bitcoin is an 8 yr old technology that still does incredible things and is generally unaffected by one of the very few attack vectors all while providing mathematically secure digital scarcity.  Please go be a peasant somewhere else
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:51:59
Because other value storing currencies are manipulated by govts and value is lost over time

Kind of hard to substantiate a sock puppet since the purpose of a sockpuppet is anonymity u peasant

I guess the problem would be the time in between sha 256 being broken and sha 512 being implemented.  This would probably cause an emergency hard fork to recover the funds.  It would be very bearish for btc either way.  I assume sha 256 is a ways away from being cracked though
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:36:08
Well put.  I would love for Trezor to have some sort of partition that would allow it to appear as if you are sweeping the entirety of funds while only sweeping one account(with much less funds).  Therefore in the wrench or govt situation you have plausible deniability that the trezor now has no funds left.
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:36:15
Sounds right, i wasn't that knowledgeable about that part of the protocol thanks
@_date: 2017-02-14 19:43:18
It serves a function for me.  Im able to cryptographically store wealth in a global immutable ledger
@_date: 2017-02-06 14:31:51
No, a hard fork would make me lose all faith in bitcoin since immutability would be broken.  I would sell all my coins before the price tanked
@_date: 2017-02-23 05:26:03
Thats why we use bitcoin
@_date: 2017-02-23 14:59:45
Bitcoin Unlimited cares not for your 'technical arguments'.  It just FEELS right and if it puts everybody's money at risk well thats something we all have to live with

Man the more i read this subreddit the more i realize its been completely taken over by paid shills of BU.  So much misinformation and FUD just floods the comment section by these sockpuppets and shill accounts.  Kind of sad because BU is simply an attack on bitcoin anybody with an understanding of computer science can see that
@_date: 2017-03-15 02:10:52
In this thread BU shills grasping at straws.  Its over fam you guus lost
@_date: 2017-03-02 19:58:56
Very bearish and very depressing to me.  No way around it we need to see how this shakes out before i go all in

The guy is a dilm critic whom undoubtedly cant read code or probably explain the protocol at a high level even.  Not sure why this made the subreddit.

I'll be interested to hear other opinions.  I believe this method to be right behind a trezor in terms of security.  I have a prepaid android with data and wifi turned off that i sent bitcoin to.  Mycellium from a microsd was installed onto the phone. I dont see many attack vectors but would love to hear some.  Feels like great cold storage
@_date: 2016-12-20 07:13:01
Not sure why this made me lol so hard.  Thanks though we appreciate you

I think you underestimate the bitcoin community and their intelligence but i agree there are many in bitcoin only for the potential profit upside
@_date: 2017-04-11 13:53:15
The bitcoin network would die in yhis case since the majority of users are into bitcoin to prevent these exact measures.  A new coin that offers privacy and fungibility would take over

Hi SamouraiWalletDev.  Apparently im slow and dont understand this but i sent a transaction of 1BTC to an address using Ricochet and i cant for the life of me find where it went.  I searched the blockchain at blockchain.info and the address still says 0BTC. I know Ricochet jumps a couple of addresses before it goes to the destination but why isnt the btc in the address to where i sent it?
Edit:  i can see the address in which the 1BTC is but do i still habe the corresponding private key?  I sent it to a different address on my Trezor
@_date: 2017-04-11 17:25:29
Tldr the main people blocking Segwit(a very important upgrade to bitcoin that increases privacy and fungibility while also fixing multiple other important shortcomings of the protocol) were found to be blocking Segwit because they were covertly using a mining advantage.  Now the users are exercising their option to say fuck off to this asic manufacturing monopoly by soft forking and activating Segwit with a User Activated Soft Fork.  
@_date: 2017-04-11 18:26:59
Greg Maxwell is set to provide proof ive heard.  I heard about the SHA256 collisions but im not sure it applies here.  I kind of only know the TLDR tbh.  Or im just too lazy and at work.  Yw tho

Also for all those who recently got into bitcoin, you should know that r/btc is heavily cen-sored (hyphenated so this post isn't hidden). 
r/btc is a cesspool of misinformation about bitcoin
