The only thing backing the USD is military force and the gold standard was removed near WW2 because the government couldn't go to war and actually pay for it so they created a fake economy propped up by violence.
Bitcoin is backed by math and the continued deflation that is happening at all times. Bitcoin can only gain value because Bitcoin will continually be produced less and less. Bitcoin is backed by the users that exchange it, the companies that develop for it and the communities that help it grow. It's a grassroots movement to dismantle the financial elite and empower the people. It's more than just a bubble and it's bigger than the here and now.
If his simple mind can't understand those facts, then maybe he's not worth talking too about Bitcoin.

Except if you connected the original client it would still work on the real actual, unbroken block chain. And majority consensus is there. So, that makes you wrong. It is the original bitcoin. A softfork still works on the same chain. Bcash does not work on the same chain.
Yes, bitcoin has higher fees, but bcash is not bitcoin. Bitcoin is Bitcoin.

Because the person would go first and things would seem fine, even using family and friends to transfer the money, then do a reversal on the transaction. In a situation with an online trade where you are the more reputable person so you have them go first, something like that wouldn't happen with BTC.

Monero would be the better option, zcash is inherently less anonymous because not all transactions are hidden.

You asked what it means, that is what it means. People that generally spend a lot of time in court are usually seen as drama queens, unreliable, snarks or some other form of bad people to be around. Also if you spend a lot of time in court suing people it's less likely that you are going to be taken serious because you could be seen as someone that is just out to make money or make lawsuits etc.

Western unions money can be censored.
Value, despite what you may think, can come in the form of not being able to shut someone up. Value can come in the form of not being able to have your money garnished and ripped from you in a court order. The privacy of funds stored is value in its self. Completely, with out a doubt, there is value in crypto that is widely used, which bitcoin is. Even if banned, it will be used. Regulation will not stop the laundering, the tax evasion, the dark market... That is value.

@_date: 2017-10-27 16:45:22
That's really weird. If it was from blockchain.info you can go into your settings and grab the private key, import that into electrum and double spend the coins with a higher fee, this will force a new transaction.
I did a transaction with a .5 cent fee and it went through after 15 hours. I guess it depends on how fast you need to get that through.

How is that seamless? That would require more resources overall.
cointracker.info can link directly into your exchanges using API's so you don't even have to update it manually. That works with Binance, Bittrex, poloniex, hitbtc, campbx... practically all of them.
This is just a really easy way to lose your wallet files imo. But you do you man!
@_date: 2017-10-11 14:06:48
Yep, which is also why I said to make multiple and to split them between the wallets.
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:26:36
That's a very broad way of saying you don't know what you're talking about.
The value creation is things like the other front page posts about Microsoft investing in identification built on top of the block chain. Moving money in hours and not 5-7 days over seas, beyond borders. Censorless money is practically priceless.

Because it could send that information in the background. It could store a load of them for X time or just constantly send information when plugged into a PC.

That specifically says bitcoin.com and shapeshift which has nothing to do with the FAKE information you are spreading regarding COINBASE.com.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:25:32
I would move your BTC to a new wallet/private key, then use electron to sweep the key and send that to a new wallet too.
@_date: 2017-10-09 17:09:35


That's no private key... but it does hold 50 BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:18:32
Nail in the coffin as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2017-10-27 18:41:50
The more miners there are the more secure the network is. Nodes mean very little when someone can spin up massive amounts of them with little effort.

I meant $10,000 of btc if you read that as 10,000 BTC.
@_date: 2017-10-31 20:17:41
Might as well sign up for the free stuff.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:04:25
Also, if you do mess up, BCH and BTC private keys are interchangeable, so if they are missing on one, check the other for the balance. Maybe back up both sets up keys separately.
@_date: 2017-09-26 14:59:17
What do you think would happen if 200k bitcoin was dumped on an exchange? The biggest bitcoin exchange out there is only 122 million, less than half the amount these bitcoins would sell for.
@_date: 2018-02-14 15:20:47
~~Etherdelta~~ Delta, Blockfolio, cryptocompare, cointracking.info.. there's so many free options that paying for this is completely unnecessary.

Both true statements. I just don't like the idea and decide not to recommend it in most occasions.

Just history repeating its self.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:41:50
You should hold your own private keys that way after a few days or weeks you can split them your self by importing the keys into another wallet after sending your BTC to a new address. That's a simplified answer, you should really do more research into storage and bitcoin safety all around.
@_date: 2017-10-02 20:53:15
I agree completely. Best bet is to just HODL. Never touch them again.
@_date: 2017-10-16 15:06:13
What happens when someone orders $10k of BTC and they get the BTC then the transaction fails from the bank?
Edit: added dollar sign.
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:20:40
Because it is an electrum fork, which is what you said you used for bitcoin.
It's what I used as well.
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:26:55
Gubbermints are getting scared. So buh bye to that market manipulation and control.

I've found if you send the invite from a phone it doesn't work.. just personal experience. If you didn't get it, you didn't do it right and you can't get it. They won't even grant it if either of you put in a ticket either.
@_date: 2017-10-11 04:11:27
Just in case out of some random act of God someone guesses or brute forces a private key. (Not likely ever, again call me paranoid)
As for hardware wallets that are electronic, I'd hate for something ever to happen where there's a back door from the developers or it got wet in a flood.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:36:38
You should post the source out or something.

While cool, it also states that it is not giving people their B2X coins, which is not cool
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:04:31
Yes. Or keep both just in case. ETH Classic is worth more the ETH was before the fork happened. Best to just HODL everything.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:24:44
Just for clarification, it does not. It needs to be $100 within 90 days.
@_date: 2017-09-15 15:16:09
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:03:33
I'm going to start charging you soon lol.
Yeah I use electrum. Make sure your BTC are safe, then you can use  to sweep the addresses into a new bch wallet. You can't have electrum and electron open at the same time.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:00:37
Why wasn't that taken yet? How much did it cost you?
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:19:34
Yes, true. I don't use them but I wouldn't hold them there through the fork. I personally have everything stored securely in my own wallets of course.
@_date: 2017-10-12 18:04:30

I got $28 into paragon coin just in case. Come at me.
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:56:35
Electron is the bitcoin cash fork of Electrum. Each fork uses their own network/code so you have to use their wallet.

Me me!
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:55:22
Yes, it would work similarly across most, if not all crypto.
@_date: 2017-10-24 12:19:35
Do you have your own wallet on a local program? If so, yes.
You just have to import the private key to a wallet that supports the B2X chain.
If your money is on Coinbase. Also yes. You will end up receiving both coins.
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:32:49
I'll have to give it a go, it's been atleast 2-3 months since I tried. I use the Delta app on my phone now. It's a pain cause you have to manually set it all up, but once you do it is very detailed in gains, losses and sales.
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:52:38
If they were on your ledger before August 1st, yes you have access to your BCH still.
Here's a guide: 
@_date: 2017-10-17 20:42:50
I know, it's insane.
@_date: 2017-10-19 18:25:01
The best shit posts are those that piss everyone off. If the late confirmations didn't get them, the typo did!
@_date: 2017-10-10 00:57:16
After BCH, I'd wager people will accumulate and buy more.
@_date: 2017-10-11 03:50:17
Ended up sending her to bitaddress.org and telling her to print a few different wallets and split the coin up between them. Told her to get a safety deposit box, gave her instructions on how to import private keys and had her print that off along with a short explanation of what Bitcoin is. Let her know to put a family member on the box and not to tell anyone about it.
Smart girl, too bad she's bat shit crazy.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:51:08
They want to confuse people and cause disruption.
@_date: 2017-10-27 14:48:41
Idk how it works, but it scares me lol.
Kinda cool you can buy and sell with it.
@_date: 2017-10-11 06:14:17
Want her number, maybe you can help her out.
@_date: 2017-10-24 14:03:24
Yes, it states that at the bottom.
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:38:41
Found it on the bitcoin facebook from 2014 lol
@_date: 2017-10-16 02:54:12
bitaddress.org, just print it out and laminate it.
@_date: 2017-10-18 19:16:49
I believe 64% of all bitcoin has been lost since it's creation. That BTC will probably never be recovered.
@_date: 2017-10-26 13:09:03
Try for that. I don't frequent there much, but they are a bit more tolerant in the S2X functionality.
@_date: 2017-10-09 16:09:43
I love how honest the people are that are involved with the "real" bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:15:42
You should add a list of the highest fees paid and the dates associated at the bottom for each fork within the past 48 hours.

With no raid, you'd have to rebuild that from scratch if it failed every single time. You'd need about 12 of those drives to build something stable.

About what mh/s seems to be worth it?
I made my first earnings through bitvisit at about 0.0000672 in 20 minutes.
