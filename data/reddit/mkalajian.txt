How would loans work if the value never stabilizes?  You think that we will reach some long term stability price, but that cannot happen under unregulated/finite coin supply and static adoption (which isn't a property of a good currency).
Yeah, we have crashes in the USA all the time... and it happens all over the world even worse than here... but you know what, with Bitcoin the ultimate bubble is going to be WAY worse than the housing crisis or anything.... I think you need to rethink your Bitcoin view.  It is a smart payment system that actually works!!! but it isn't a currency

I have heard that school that offer "packages" are often scams or not as good as schools that make you pay as you fly by flight /instruction hour.
Flying more than one hour a day is inefficient as students get tired/stressed...

if you think HODLing will make you rich... boy you're in for a rude awakening.  SELL.  even IF BTC goes back up to 400, 500, etc... you can always BUY IN THE FUTURE before it ramps up... why the fuck would you hold on to a sinking ship?

its not demand driven and it has never been.  the idea is we think it MIGHT Be demand driven in the future (speculation).
right now a fair price would be a $100:1BTC just for the easy of calculation, it would completely function fine at that price, there are not enough users yet to cause an real reason for 1 BTC to be worth more than $100 right now

where is the feature where trustedcoin only generates one key and keeps the other one?  I don't even get why that would be considered safer than just generating one key locally because if the machine was not compromised during key generation then by generating one key that only you know, you're better off than a 3rd party knowing it from the start?

hm.. that's pretty cool.  i wish there was also a way to solve the delivery of the private key from the computer to the person being intercepted, cause like i said, if the attacker has already seen the key i will be using and the key i will be storing away he will basically have my coins

ahhh i get it now. ok that is great!! will consider using this.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:00:01
no, i suggest you read THIS...  -- Another important point is that 51% of the network is not needed to launch such attacks; if all you want is to defraud a merchant who accepts transactions after waiting N confirmations (usually, N = 3 or N = 6), if your mining pool has portion P of the network you can succeed with probability (P / (1-P))^N; at 35% hashpower and 3 confirmations, this means that GHash can currently steal altcoins from an altcoin exchange with 15.6% success probability – once in every six tries.

It's amazing how easily the sentiment of this subreddit is swayed by price changes.  I've said this EVERY crash, and I'll say it again... it's as if we have multiple personalities here, OR there are two groups interested in Bitcoin and each comes out to comment during rallys vs. crashes.
Anyway... rinse and repeat I guess.

Good point, they can, but probably won't because they lost a LOT of money...  I'm saying that the gains we are used to are manipulated, I was expecting $10,000/BTC by the middle of 2015, but now it's looking more like $100

Has anyone stopped to think, "what if this is true?"
Seriously, think about it.  What if Bitcoin WAS just a way for the creator to make a ridiculous sum of money... what if the price is falling because Satoshi realized that this may be the last "bubble" and it's time to slowly convert his hoards of coins to dollars, eating up the order books.
Bitcoin is cool and all, but really...

all wallets already exist... you can open the wallet on any client regardless of where else it might have been accessed from... just use the private key

Pricing things in USD and just adjusting the BTC quote is a huge problem... if people really want bitcoin to work, they need to price things out in BTC.
Want this Jet-Ski?  Okay it's 1BTC.  NO MATTER WHAT the exchange rate it.  This will force the exchange rate to stablize

This is probably the 3rd time Mt. Gox has proven to be irresponsible.  I have no sympathy for anyone who expected their Gox money to play out into real money.
If you held a LOT of Bitcoin, you should have understood the concept of private keys.  If you were an early adopter, you should have stopped using Gox when they started to have USD withdrawal problems...
I used to have BTC and USD in Gox, they used to be great, but once their shit starting breaking due to hacks/too much volume... I moved to another exchange.  It is best for Gox to die now than later, as others have said.
Gox will leave people in limbo for as long as they can.

Decide for yourself: 
The upward curve is what the bulls think will happen (i.e., a bubble on the order of magnitude 10k)
The downward line is what the bears think will continue (i.e., a gradual decline down to 0 value, with green blips of hopeful whales "buying in")

I think the dude (CEO) is just answering everything super vaguely (almost like a robot answering questions based on a keyword in the sentence) and when a "digital currency" was brought up he defaulted to his spiel about "PayPal is used with all kinds of currencies"
That question came out of nowhere, too... I wonder if the anchor/whoever writes the script holds Bitcoin.  Pretty sure most people realize that Bitcoin will not 'eliminate' PayPal...

you are the only person with sense on this forum... i'm also having trouble finding the statistics, but it seems silk road was a HUGE percentage of BTC transactions, the other being gambling... right now the value is being artificially being held up by speculators worldwide... it's another bubble but this time the burst will be dramatic.

on the face of it it sounds great to compare bitcoin to diamonds and altcoins to cubic zirconium, but think about it more and its a SHIT comparison.... diamonds are sought after in jewelry because of MARKETING... HOWEVER diamonds are actually valuable in terms of their CONDUCTIVITY PROPERTIES, HARDNESS, and INDEX OF REFRACTION..... a better comparison would be comparing natural diamond vs synthetic diamond but even that is stupid... just stop

I can see how my post can be misread as trying to "control" the exchange rate... this is not what I was trying to convey.
If a person has the money and they want Bitcoins, they can get it... there is an EXCESS of Bitcoins right now just sitting in cold storage and even many ready to be bought now.  After the mining is over in a few years, then we MIGHT see this difficulty-of-acquisitions, but right now, we don't... it's not hard to get Bitcoins for USD

when the miners stop mining, they'll be having the last laugh.  bitcoin will come to a halt when there is no reward left for miners.

@_date: 2013-10-29 23:50:30
so have I, i was young and naive when it was pre $30 bubble and hadn't realized I could *save* BTC to have more purchasing power... but that doesn't mean the high price is justifiable... who says BTC won't settle around $100 per??? it could be mass adopted AND work without being $100,000 per...
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:43:28
however you think you generate your private key, it starts with almost any 256bit number... 
@_date: 2013-10-24 02:06:23
sell now (high) buy after the correction (low) -- this *will* happen, maybe not till after $500, but after a few months without a doubt the price will be lower at least one time than it is now... you buy more or the same number of btc you had and boom, DEM GAINZ SON
@_date: 2013-10-03 06:04:00
that doesnt mean bitcoins value will go up oh my god l2purchasingpower
@_date: 2013-12-10 17:55:41
i know, but for Bitcoin to be mainstream it needs this semi-centralization... people don't like using IP addresses to access servers, and people willl not use Bitcoin if they need to look at cryptic Base58 numbers

bulls win, bears win, pigs get slaughtered.
i used to transact with BTC ever since the price was $2-7/$14-30... stopped after a while and when it was rising up past $70 bought a bunch... sold those at $250, bought some more at $130... sold those at $200 and will buy again at $150...... much more returns than just holding

i bought and used (as currency you sheep!!) 100's of BTC when they were &lt;$10.
Part of me feels like an idiot for not seeing the potential of a BTC "savings account" back then... but on the other hand if I (and many others) didn't spend any BTC we wouldn't be here in the first place.

fuck fukc fukc SELL!!!!!
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:59:45
i think that's a little irrelevant... okay let me break it down better:
1) Alice wants a vanity address so she opens up an application which bruteforces the keyspace until a match with her query of "1Alice" is found. She is given the full address and private key, no one else has it.
2) Eve knows the utility that Alice used to generate the address, and uses the same query "1Alice" and is given the same result and same private key.. now Eve can access Alice's coins
3) Obviously the address generators do not work like this, they are *somewhat* random(er), but is this concern valid??

someone will go to bitaddress.org and generate a random wallet... they will import the private key into their client and notice that there is already a balance!! (someone else was already using that same key)
the guy who had the wallet first will make a post saying "my coins were stolen" and the 2nd lucky guy will come on here and say "oh shit, dude i think i got your key"
everyone will say how the chances are SOOOO low of it ever happening again, but then people will say fuck that and stop using bitcoin.

diamonds are hard, have better light refracting properties, etc... (terrible analogy btw) if a new network with the same or better features pops up when Bitcoin is saturated there is no reason not to switch / parallel.
today, bitcoin is the most active 'coin' but once it becomes saturated there is no reason another 'coin' can't take over...
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:06:29
the main point i'm making is that the bitcoin price isn't reflecting anything other than people trying to make money... no new technology / adoption has happened... no reason for the price to spike... it was a pump and dump.

@_date: 2013-11-08 21:55:31
Not surprised to see no serious responses here... The "correction" will happen in many scenarios
1)  We have another successful hacker, this was the cause of the first two "corrections."  The hacker takes down some exchanges, manipulates the price, or does something to stir up a panic-frenzy.
2)  Word of mouth spreads so much that the market becomes saturated, the price stops climbing because everyone already "bought in" and no one willing is left to buy BTC at the price
3) Big players decide that enough profit is enough and sell off large amounts of coins, this causes panic, and boom.
1 and 3 can happen at any time... if 2 happens the price would likely saturate in months, I doubt the upward trend will last that long.  Brace yourselves, a hack or sell-off is coming and there is nothing you can do to predict it unless you are the hacker/investor...
GOOD LUCK EVERYBODY

@_date: 2013-11-05 19:28:44
in the reality that BTC is applicable to niche internet markets and is not an all-encompassing currency like you are assuming (confirmation times being the main issue)...
your scenario of multiple zeros being added in the long term is possible, but only if the dollar collapses to a point where it costs $1000 for a gallon of water... or people stop trusting credit cards or something... some crazy socio-economic collapse... which may happen, yes, but then other things would be more valuable than BTC.
I see the price sneaking up to $1000 no problem in the following months (short term), but in a few years or so it will adjust back down
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:59:58
oh wow thank you so smart
when merchants implement firm BTC prices, the value will stabilize toward that
@_date: 2013-12-06 05:10:50

i was under the impression that there were more like 10^70 addresses since you could generate an address based on a 64 character hex string??
if the hash power could do 6e15 nonces, lets just assume the same for generating a public key (and checking for a balance, maybe in software) from a known random priv key and that would mean in ... oh.. 39 decades a collision would happen... but still, i feel like computer power and ability to break the crypto bitcoin is based on is more likely to happen than bitcoin actually being WORTH 1k/coin...

@_date: 2013-10-11 01:17:40
i see bitcoin as currency, obviously... but it's also possible to invest in currency.. you cannot deny the overwhelming bias speculation has in the bitcoin market.
not many people are *using* their bitcoins right now and the value is relatively high... just because bitcoins have value and dollars have value doesn't mean they are equals.

you people are making it seem WAY worse than it is... yeah you can't withdraw money, but you can still deposit bitcoins and still trade with "gox bux" (for a profit of BTC if you sell high/buy low) and output the BTC to your own wallet or whatever... calm down, their wires were expensive as hell anyway.

Bitcoin's value stemmed from the black markets... without the black markets (granted there is still gambling so that will retain some value) Bitcoin is worth nothing... expect LOW LOW exchange rates within the week... like $10/btc
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:18:33
yes, it would affect the exchange rate... do you even understand demand???
why do you think bitcoin ever started increasing in value?? because people wanted to acquire bitcoin so that they could buy drugs.
now, say an xbox was listed for 10,000 satoshi, right now.  people like us would buy that shit up QUICK because we have HELLA satoshi, it's practically free for us.... BUT, people who DON'T have any bitcoin will want to acquire some to buy the xbox, and they would be willing to pay around $299 for those 10,000 satoshi to get their xbox... the price would stablize like so.
capice? 
edit: right now people are only acquiring bitcoin because they think that it will increase in value and they can sell it off for USD = speculation = BUBBLE = makes us look like beanie baby hoarders
@_date: 2013-10-02 23:28:46
look... there is nothing that demands the need for bitcoin other than anonymous markets... plain and simple... everything can be handled with google wallet/paypal/etc... until those are not options, bitcoin will not be widely used for legitimate businesses ... stop repeating what people have parroted to you and think for your fucking self... damn
@_date: 2013-11-05 22:46:17
because he's down with the cause... once an xbox is offered for 10,000 satoshi, it would drive the BTC price up FOR REAL anyway... not artificially like now.

@_date: 2013-11-26 03:42:26
then you are invested in it for the wrong reason.
bitcoin may be worth this much if it lives on long enough (i.e., the encryption doesn't get broken or something) and the US dollar collapses or something (like your middle-class checking account cant even afford the necessities anymore) but if you really believe it is worth its market price right now then you wouldn't need to exchange it for another currency to "redeem" that value, it should have it inherently.

oh and this subway in poland takes it, you have to wait at the cash register before 6 confirmations though so make sure you bring a snack with you

are you perturbed, dude?
@_date: 2013-11-06 19:58:37
its good man its good. i agree with you.. we need to appropriately price things in BTC online and keep em that way, not just write USD prices in BTC.. that's useless
@_date: 2013-10-02 20:59:25
i don't need to explain... the largest market using bitcoins just shut down..... 
the largest 'legitimate' company that takes bitcoins is wordpress, do you know what their revenue was? 2BTC... you think there is a significant legitamite  market? please.
@_date: 2013-11-23 21:58:46
thank you. finally.  the thing is right now people think they might be onto something very promising, so they are willing to pay what they think is fair for a coin, which is almost $1000 now.  this is worth it in their heads because 1) it will keep going up and they will make money, or 2) they feel like they own wealth in now being able to transfer money through this newly infamous currency.
inevitably, these people will lose interest as they discover this change isn't going to be overnight... it will take years, and even then it's uncertain if another cryptocurrency will replace bitcoin...
there will come a time where the market is no longer resilient to crashes (right now it CLEARLY is).  lots of NEW people are willing to pay money when people sell their coins right now.  eventually there wont be many people willing to (this might take MONTHS), and when that happens the market will crash.  and that's not the only possibility... a hack to the protocol or major exchanges or wallet client may crash bitcoin for GOOD.
we need more talk about this... i'll be transparent and say that I hold bitcoin, but never would "cash them out" in an exchange... shit I would love to see my bitcoin be able to do something great, like buy a trip to space for me on day, but honestly that may never happen and people act like its a GIVEN. fuck!

goddamnit this is what makes bitcoin look like a fucking pyramid scheme... 
@_date: 2013-07-19 16:44:02
Ok, this is an important question and I feel like people overlook it...  Back in the day, Bitcoin was assigned an arbitrary value just so it could "work" as a currency:  "Hey, send me 10,000 (arbitrary) Bitcoins and I'll send you a pizza!" -- BTC valued at $0.001.
Eventually, the value went up because people didn't want to send 10,000BTC every time they wanted to buy something (an ounce of weed).  So the value moved up to $1, and now it was a fairly easy way to understand how much you were paying for your drugs.
As more people started to get into this, the value rose because acquiring Bitcoins wasn't as easy anymore (miners, total number in circulation, etc...) so now with just 1BTC you could buy more things.
Eventually, the speculation began and people were willing to pay an INSANE amount for a Bitcoin because they thought the "value" would keep rising (when in reality, the value is the same... it's the advantage of the technology over USD transactions)...
In order for Bitcoin to work, it needs some kind of exchange rate to USD... it can be 1:1 or 100:1 or 1:100... generally this is determined by *how easy it is to acquire Bitcoins*  the harder it is to acquire, the higher people will pay for it
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:21:15
it will prevent drug dealers from buying things with their criminal money
@_date: 2013-09-07 00:27:13
Safe?  Mine BTC with hardware you already own.
Responsible?  Buy as much BTC as you can afford to spend without hurting your necessity budget, save half in cold-storage and use the rest to buy drugs from Silk Road.  Sell the drugs, for a USD profit, to your local high-schoolers.

how does it not make sense to you it is very clear to everyone else...
i'm not talking literally about DNS i'm talking about "WNS"...
vanity addresses still include a bunch of base58 nonsense and at best you can customize, what, 6 characters if you are super lucky??? cmon now
@_date: 2013-11-05 20:44:20
all the maths, once it's $500 then you wont make money unless you bought for $499, but after $501 u lose money
$500 is mathematically the moon

no one said evil.. if you were looking to "get rich quick" off bitcoin and you fucked up, LOL i dont feel sorry for you -- you realize that without those people, people like me wouldn't have made any money either.

@_date: 2013-12-05 04:59:16
the amount of upvotes this is getting is sickening.  the definition of a "pop" includes coming down way faster than the climb... it will happen.... not saying the price won't ever be this high again, but it will come down faster than you can panic sell.
@_date: 2013-12-09 04:15:39
doubt anyone is working on it it's just something i randomly thought up but hey it's more likely than a wallet collision :P
i think it would be awesome if bitcoin transcends currency in such a fashion
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:22:53
of course it's a fucking bubble there is no reason people are willing to pay so much for BTC other than thinking they are going to make more money... China is stubborn, however... it may be a long term bubble

@_date: 2013-11-15 21:50:21
you aren't moving money across borders you are simply signing bits of data over to someone else who is on the same internet.  the infrastructure has to be there for bitcoin to be used as money.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:22:10
@_date: 2013-11-27 22:10:07
exactly my concern... well, actually i'm more concerned about if Coinbase can even accomodate this transation... WTF do I say I they do send me that fat lump, gambling winnings???  why would a 20k ACH randomly pop up in my bank account... &gt;.&lt;
I've determined if I don't get this money out and miss the chance too (i.e., price drops back down below 500) I'll be PISSED!!!  I've been acting like I own this money but I really don't... I just own the bitcoins :|  Looking to build a race-car with some of the money can't do that with BTC ...
anyway, I might regret it if it turns into 50k... but seeing how I only invested 2k... probably not :)
@_date: 2013-05-29 21:58:36

@_date: 2013-07-11 23:40:57
Am I missing something here?  You still need to link a bank account (takes 3 or 4 days), and you still need to wait 30 days after this, and they have all your personal info...
What's wrong with wiring money to mt.gox, once the money is there you can also buy bitcoins INSTANTLY
I'm confused over all the fuss here....?

Yup.  I was surprised to hear that no one in my family (even the technically inclined and economists) had heard about Bitcoin.

how do you figure?  bitcoin was working fine at $5 a coin there is nothing to say that it won't settle back down to that
@_date: 2013-10-22 18:55:31
great question.  we are no doubt going to see this growth until something major happens, there will always be people 'buying in' with the promise of 'getting rich' (it's the chinese now, it was the americans in the last bubble) until something scares them.
maybe it will be a btcchina hack... maybe a cultural thing in china... who knows...
@_date: 2013-08-03 23:37:10

@_date: 2013-09-11 16:56:11
no you
@_date: 2013-10-11 16:32:02
a logical response, in my thread!? 
haha, i don't know for sure.. but it might be easy to imagine a scenario where a bitcoin can be used for X, gives the holder some power (purchasing or otherwise), yet the holder doesn't want to spend/use/transfer the coin so obtaining one is nearly impossible (i.e., the value isn't coming from trading, but some new inherent property bitcoin gains in the future)
a 2nd system would be released to allow the 'others' who cannot acquire bitcoin
@_date: 2013-07-22 21:41:09
yes, good!  this is the reason bitcoin has worked, no one should think otherwise.
@_date: 2013-10-10 22:40:37
bit-coin can be duplicated unlike gold
@_date: 2013-05-23 21:30:01
but i think you're assuming vanitygen and other tools hunt at random through the keyspace, what if they went sequentially (or similar)?
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:11:47
just made a post about this lol... but yeah, how much of the people who will/can buy btc have already and how much is left
@_date: 2013-12-12 20:47:27
Cryptocurrency = Internet
Bitcoin = all the companies people were investing in
it's just an analogy for fuck's sake
@_date: 2013-12-15 01:49:29
i think i do, but you have to look at it from a non-brute-force collision situation... it can happen in other ways
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:04:19
i bought at 200... i'd say this is high. it's all relative.  if you bought at 1200 dont sell obviously
@_date: 2013-11-15 21:20:17
ah yeah, i forgot, you just want to get rich quick doing nothing,  you don't really care about paying bills with bitcoin or anything like that... for all  you care after you "cash out" bitcoin can die and it would matter to you... feck off
@_date: 2013-12-30 23:23:36

If you like to gamble check out satoshicircle.com, sealswithclubs.eu, or just-dice.. basically you transfer a small amount out of your wallet into the casino's wallet which was uniquely autogenerated for you, you get gambling credits, and can cash it back out into bitcoin just as fast as you deposited!!
good luck with your long term financial goals of 2014
@_date: 2013-10-02 18:45:45
Can we please stop running around the truth?  Bitcoin is a great technology, it enabled this amazing market (online drugs) and others like it (online gambling).  That is where the value came from, people wanted to get in on the drug trade as well as the gambling fun.... YES most of you got in on it because you wanted to make money, but you are not the majority... as you told your friends about how much money you were making, they too became speculators and pumped up the price (they were willing to pay more to make more, it DID look promising)... but you and your friends didn't REALLY understand why bitcoin could actually be traded for USD.  Now you know.
Since gambling is still around, and since another black market will pop up, bitcoin will retain some value... but it wont be back up to where it was for a while... in the upcoming weeks it will sink down as more and more people realize what happened (this is really fresh guys, people are still sleeping...)

No the ethernet is not used. All you need the the FPGA, power, and UART connection (and clock oscillator)

If you took the entire hashrate and modified the mining process to brute force private keys what would be the chance of a collision in say a month of running the machine???

This was the China bubble.
The previous one was the Mt. Gox bubble.
Before that was the hacker bubble, and before that was the crypto-geeks discovering their inner businessman.
Next up: ???

okay but it's dumb to just hold when you can sell now, buy more when it's lower, and then in the end you'll have used none of your USD, but only gained BTC... instead of just having what you have .. why not??

why the fuck would i move money out of an investment that is growing exponentially into smaller returns?
yes, the growth can't continue forever, but it will at least soar by the next order of magnitude (10,000/btc) and perhaps as far as a few more (1,000,000/btc) if the mining network continues to grow and miners stay honest

I will take PayPal gift payments once I'm ready to distribute, yes.  I will also take Chase Quick Pay or BTC :)
