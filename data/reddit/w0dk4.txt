My point is that Jeff is not at all in favor of the proposal, as he outlined on the mailing list. Same for Gavin. So in conclusion, the proposal does not really represent the "tech community".
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:50:53
Sure, just read [this email]( and then feel free to dig further (this sparked quite a discussion on the mailing list).
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:13:11


So, Gavin Andresen and Jeff Garzik are not part of the "tech community" now?
@_date: 2015-12-29 00:20:58


Did you just say that it is embarrassing that Gavin Andresen, an "anonymous non-programmer" is calling himself a Bitcoiner?
Wake up.
@_date: 2015-12-29 02:12:25


Interesting. How do you know I'm not a programmer?
@_date: 2015-08-10 22:24:34
Thanks, that's actually helpful - so it was really mostly an anti-DoS measure.


I'm interested. How do you actually arrive at these statements? Did you conduct a survey among all "bitcoin experts"? What constitutes a "bitcoin expert"?
@_date: 2015-08-17 13:39:03
Too bad with small blocks they won't be able to take part because fees would be too high.
@_date: 2015-08-10 19:28:57
Wow, that argument list in the Wiki is so obviously biased it's not even funny..
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:25:41
What is "proper consensus"? You mean full Bitcoin Core dev consensus? IMO this will never happen on the blocksize debate. Also, this is dangerous centralized thinking, because it means that a single person can veto a blocksize increase.
As regards "normal" consensus, as in what the network runs in the majority, we will see. Either XT will be adopted or not. So what is your actual problem? It seems like you are in favor of a closed group of Bitcoin core devs deciding for you rather than actually using Bitcoin's built-in voting mechanism. If the experts of Bitcoin Core cannot convince the majority to stick with Bitcoin Core instead of XT (which remains to be seen), there may be some merit to the XT fork don't you think?
Also note that *doing nothing* is actually radically different from past Bitcoin development, as Jeff Garzik pointed out here: 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:58:40
No. We don't directly control the speed (user adoption). What we can control is the track we are on. We have a track which is sort of unstable if too many users are on our train. But we can also change to a more stable track right now so we can support more users on our train in the future before it is a problem.

Please just read this:

It has been edited since, there was but one argument in favor on the wiki. 
@_date: 2015-08-16 11:51:29


Why? It is not like Gavin and Mike are some amateurs that just developed some random new fork. BitcoinXT has been running for a while and the bigger block patch has been tested by Gavin. If 75% of the network has switched and the fork occurs, the fork will be settled in hours because it does not make any sense for any entity in the Bitcoin economy to be running on a 25% fork which is declining.


I agree this might actually be a move to get some other changes in as well. But if you think so and disagree with the other changes, you can still compile and run Core just with the bigger block patch set. Mike just thinks that the Bitcoin Core consensus process is flawed and wants to improve on it with XT and its manifesto.


As you might have already seen, many disagree here: higher fees and limited growth directly proportional to the blocksize.

I hear that over and over again. Considering the stance on hard forks on bitcoin.org and in the Bitcoin core project, this will be anything but straight forward to do! Also, it does not make sense to wait for the network to degrade before acting.
@_date: 2015-11-04 20:46:57


Well, it can reach consensus and it is done by full nodes and miners (and the longest chain). Otherwise, the network could easily be attacked and taken down.


Yes! And hard forks work the exact same way. And can even be done from rogue implementations just like XT if they gain enough support (in XT's case 75%). Permissionless innovation! Wouldnt that be great? ;)

I think it is important the we get an increase ASAP as we are already hitting network saturation right now. A proposal which will take a year to activate will not be good enough. If a year passes by without increase and core implements transaction eviction for low-fee transactions, this will also be the death of 0-conf. Peter will then implement replace-by-fee and we need to rely on 1-conf period. At this point, the argument for bitcoin will be very hard to communicate because
* Fees are no longer tiny
* Payments are no longer instant for non-critical transactions (i.e. small transactions in a shop)
This will make bitcoin unusable for real world shops and there will be a major crisis and it might be possible that the momentum behind bitcoin vanishes as the majority of the bitcoin community actually enjoys low fees and instant transactions. 
I don't want this to happen and I'm not even sure this will happen, it's just a possibility. But please keep that in mind.

Ok, take it easy. I invite you to explore other posts further down on the topic of node count and decentralisation.
PS: We are in the same boat. Stop with the FUD about NSA, governments and what not.
@_date: 2015-10-05 17:11:46


And how is this a good idea? Or rephrased, how is this better than putting those rogue miners on a forked chain? 
@_date: 2015-11-27 18:00:11


Not if the receiver uses a non-RBF compatible wallet, as you said yourself...
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:24:27
There is a big difference because miners will re-join the longest chain they no longer really understand. From their point of view, they just have bad luck, all of their blocks getting orphaned. How is this good/better than miners getting split off on a permanently forked chain where they clearly see very fast that they mine invalid blocks???
@_date: 2016-07-06 20:18:20
So you are basically saying, people in the third world on dial up connections should be able to run a node while never being able to actually use the system due to excessive fees.
