Look, I would love to explain the incredibly interesting facts and theory about derivatives but unfortunately I have my risk management midterm in Friday (I know what a coincidence) anyways. Don't worry about trading 10x that amount (that is some exotic weird and complex financial products that only investment bankers and financial engineers make for sophisticated investors - I assume you got your info from Selena Gómez in the Bug short). Futures are just a contract saying I will buy X in Y days at Z price. The moment you sign that contract that contract has a value. That value will be settled in cash to avoid defaults from both parties. Look up how to value a futures contract and if you are hungry for knowledgeearn about the blackscholes model. Just remember they have really smart people working at the CME and they have their reputation to keep.

So tu summarize 1. Not a scam. 2. Cash settlements is a method of settling forward contracts or futures contracts by cash rather than by physical delivery of the underlying asset. This are industry standards. You think that if someone buy 100 contracts of crude oil (1000 barrels per contract) that in the end the buyer will get 100000 barrels delivered to his house? That is why it is settled in cash. Dude there are contracts for cows as well. No one hold futures or forwards until maturity (except the very few that cannot make a market). The CME is one of the oldest exchanges and one the first to start futures and forwards. So if they are freaking bucket shop the world doesn't make sense anymore.
Please refer any website in google with the history of the CME. Fun fact they started as the Chicago butter and egg board in 1898.
More research in cash settlement please.

Governments not banks. The only way commercial banks create money is by lending it. But hyper inflation is lead by Governments printing money not banks.
