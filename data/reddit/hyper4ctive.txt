Just re-read the WTF explanation:


So, if a bid is made for 10000 at the $75, a green bar appears for that height at that price. If it is then removed (I'm assuming this can only happen prior to the bid being fulfilled) the bar inverts itself and becomes a red bar to the height of 10000? Does the green bar remain?

Noob in the BTC economics crash course here:
So, according to the graph, the current price is 73.25? 
Are the green bars the buy/bid quantity and red bars the ask/sell?
What does the +1000 to -1000 scale on the right represent?
Why are there red and green bars on both sides of the zero?

Or use an instax/polaroid camera if you're not as photographically inclined...

Ah, thanks! I just read it but can't quite wrap my head around it.
I can see how increased buy and sell orders above the line work but what about the decrease. Doesn't a decrease in buy orders just make the green bars above the line shorter? What are you referencing when the buy orders decrease? Decrease against what? 
Sorry if I am getting too confusing...
