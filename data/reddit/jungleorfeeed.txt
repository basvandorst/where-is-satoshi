Update: seller added .25 bitcoins to address this morning after I sent in information to ebay and leaving negative feedback. 
You can verify that by checking the date and time of when the .25 was added.
The problem is that he only sent a public key and not a private key. So there is no way to even get the .25. 
This seller is a scammer and playing games. Waste of time.

I should mention that I've never used the mycelium app nor have I ever imported from paper wallet/cold storage if it wasn't already apparent. Thanks again.

Also looked for a mycelium thread but wasn't able to find it so if I posted this in wrong place I apologize. (new to reddit)

I wouldnt be surprised if you are rwcoyote, as I listed this reddit page on his negative feedback. 
Also you say he's very responsive yet my initial query before I bought and right after I bought were extremely slow.

First off, I'm pretty sure that Fredseder=rwcoyote. Fredseder made his account right before making this post. Claims he bought 4 coins and when asked for proof never responds with it. 
Claimed approximate shipping after 2 days of cleared payment, was 3 days. Okay didn't mind since he said approximate. He claimed express shipping (1-2 days) but he sent as first class (2-3 days). With holiday shipping it got delayed even 2 more days because it was close to Christmas (no blame on scammer).  
He claims "full disclosure" and "first correspondence" as Dec. 23rd but it was actually Dec 14th. It's pretty funny how this scammer tries so hard to deceive as he actually doesn't disclose all the details not only from the stand point of his post but also from the stand point that he never actually intended on giving me the pass phrase for the private key. He only funded the bitcoins after I had sent a message and after I made a request for return. If I had never mentioned the passkey in our personal ebay messages, I'm confident he never would have sent it.  
As you can see, "first correspondence" was well before the one posted by scammer. It's pretty apparent I'm new to all this (had to spend many of my own hours researching forums/google trying to figure how to move funds until I found out th private key required a passphrase) as I ask him in the screen shots if it's possible to move the bitcoins from the physical coin. After stating that I have never moved bitcoin from a cold storage, he responds nearly 3 days later and  states that he will help me do it or do it for me. Then he proceeds to give me a link to download bitcoin core and the wiki on moving bitcoins from a private key using bitcoin core. 
After all this is when Rwcoyote aka Wileycoyote aka scammer's disclosure takes place. 
As you can see from the imgur link I provided, scammer states he will take a restocking fee although it is never mentioned in the return policy. Only attempting it out of spite. I placed images out of order and actually cut off the message time of the 3rd picture but it was 5 hours before the message in the 1st picture. Also the message was redundant because I already knew he funded the coin (late) as I had sent screen shots to ebay. 
The 4th picture is proof of a scam he did on another buyer 6 months prior.

Hey thanks for everyone that posted. Was very informative information but unfortunately my first experience trying to move from cold storage turned out to be a scam from ebay. I posted here: 
Posted this so no one else gets scammed or at least to minimize the odds. Help spread the word because this ebay user also has a website he sells off of.

This might sound dumb but in the event that I do lose it and need to back up what do I need? 
I've written down the long pass phrase down but is the only other thing I need that I need just the bitcoin address? 
@_date: 2015-12-25 22:40:44
Yep, I just check your account and you made this reddit account just to comment. 
Not that it would actually prove anything because I wouldn't be surprised if he had multiple ebay accounts just to manipulate his feedback and sales but if you have purchased 4 coins let's see some proof.
