I wish I had jumped on this train back when I first discovered it.

You should start a rap group called Bitcoin Money Millionaires.

I have no way to invest, sadly. Even if I did, I don't know if I have enough faith in the system, especially when I barely understand economics in the first place.
But back then? Mining was a viable way of getting your hands on bitcoins, admittedly not very valuable bitcoins, but here we are. These days, is it even profitable to mine as an amateur?

I think I mined bitcoins in 2009 on my old computer, which was a top-end gaming PC back then.
I need to contact the friend I gave that computer to and hope to fuck that he hasn't formatted it, I might actually be able to pay my bills this month, all because I jumped on what I thought would be a fad. A fad that I despise myself for abandoning, back then it was pretty much useless, I come back now to see that they're worth 215 dollars each? Fuck me, fuck me so much. Could've been a millionaire.

I was somewhere directly after Take off. I was 19. I got bored because mining bitcoins back then seemed pointless, there was nothing to spend them on that was worth the effort and it's not like I had a lot of foresight at 19. Shit I'd probably miss the train if a new one appeared today, I'm still missing this one because now it feels like it's too late to get on as anything more than an economy class passenger. Imagine in a couple of years when it really takes off and I'm looking back at this post.
If only there were time machines.
