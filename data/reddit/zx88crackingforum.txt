Anyone have experience using the site? Positive or negative? I have a decent amount of cc debt that I'd like to pay off with a decent amount of coins sitting around gathering dust atm. Seems like a good option even with the price a little low atm.
Edit: Going to try a test with $500 payment on an mbna mastercard.

Wonder what type of encryption they used for the passes. Probably MD5 or Sha1s lol. Nobody be cracking those bad boys!!!

Not quite. The transfer has no effect on your BTC coins. They will still be at the same paper wallet address.

I just went through the process of emptying some of my paper wallets for the BCH coins. I loaded Coinomi app on my android tablet. It lets you create a BCH wallet and then sweep a paper wallet for the balance, sending it to the BCH wallet you created. For good measure, I then sent my coins to my Trezor using  Was a very painless procedure in general.

I don't know what else to tell you friend. All I can relate is from my personal experience from doing it just a few days ago. I just installed the app, swept the  spend code and everything worked fine for me.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:07:01
Yes that is almost exactly correct. But you wont have to enter a receiving address, dont think I did it is filled in automatically . Once the BCH wallet is created, you'll see those 3 little vertical dots in the upper right corner. Click on them and the option to sweep a wallet will be there. You'll just need to scan the private spend address QR code and everything else will just take care of itself. It really isn't as daunting a task as it appears initially.

purse.io is a great option for Amazon.  is a good option for other online vendors. Signing up there gets you a virtual Visa credit card.
@_date: 2017-04-25 22:31:20
You're concerned about Amazon's communication? Sounds like you've used invalid codes in the past and they're just protecting their business. I would be more concerned with the company selling me the bunk codes.

$5.5k usd for a basic virgin. Seems a little steep.

Only going to speak from my personal experience. I didn't need to submit any kind of identifying papers to use their service at it's basic level. This got me a virtual visa CC that I used at Amazon and a few other places. They offer a USD and EUR option, so guessing it probably works in UK.

That really is a huge issue. I use copay on my windows phone and it always suggests a completely ridiculous fee. Thankfully on their last update they gave the option to set your own custom fee.

I have a windows phone and sadly CoPay is the best option for it. Was very frustrating seeing the crazy fees it recommended for every transactions. Thankfully they recently added the option to set custom ones.

Make sure you forward your 8333 port.
@_date: 2017-05-09 11:48:11
You understand that these are open source wallets, yes? There's no need to put your trust that they don't do it when you can verify it for yourself.
Try asking these companies that are losing CC info if they'll let you verify their source codes used to collect your info.

I just bought a new gaming chair on Newegg the other day with some bitcoin. Had zero issues, transaction was accepted right away and the confirmation email about 30 minutes later. You're doing something wrong, especially if you're claiming to be tech savvy.

Damn, this is sad to see. Have used DirectBet quite a few times and was always 100% satisfied with the service. Just this last week for some MMA.

Coinbase is like a bank. They have a lot of regulations to adhere too. KYC/AML not too mention gambling is restricted in most of the US so they can't be complicit in aiding people who want to enjoy themselves in such a naughty manner. God Bless the United States of America!!

Could think of the 5% like a real-estate commission, no?

Maybe you should be talking to your bank?

It is kind of surprising they sent out a warning and didn't close the account. Have seen a lot of posts in the past from people that weren't so fortunate.
