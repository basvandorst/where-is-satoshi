Believing is holding an opinion. Knowing is to have direct experience.
I know Satoshi created something brilliant and considered all issues. I know Core have fucked up badly.

Lightning Network is being developed and patented by a for-profit organisation founded by Bitcoin Core developers. The investors (banks / venture capital) expect a return of value to the tune of around $80 million (doesn't sound like much but apparently it's enough for Core to Hijack Bitcoin).
Imagine who's going to be in control of the Lightning hubs and what kind of fees you're going to pay for the privilege of using these controlled hubs (IF it will ever get here).
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:14:37
Yeah, i can assure you Bcore does not work the way it was indented nor engineered by Nakamoto. 
Using an altcoin or waiting for vaporware... Do you realise how stupid that sounds? The solution as Satoshi intended (BCH) is already up and running! 


@_date: 2017-12-12 20:02:08
It surprises me you're not banned yet. That is a representation of Satoshi; the creator of the original Bitcoin and white paper that have nothing to do with the current abomination.
You can remove the "accepted here" sign too.

“At first, most users would run network nodes, but as the network grows beyond a certain point, it would be left more and more to specialists with server farms of specialized hardware.”   – 2008.
“At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.” – 2010.
“The design supports letting users just be users.  The more burden it is to run a node, the fewer nodes there will be.  Those few nodes will be big server farms.  The rest will be client nodes that only do transactions and don’t generate.” – 2010.
“Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other’s total CPU power.  This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one.  Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength.  It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners.” – 2010.
Satoshi also foresaw merged-mining. Satoshi was/is a visionary of such magnitude that we mere mortals have a hard time even comprehending. These effects, pooled mining, ASICs, farms etc – aren’t weaknesses in the Bitcoin network – on the contrary, they are strengths.

Exactly. And if you don't believe in the creator and the reasons of existence of a coin; just fork off and create your own SegWitCoin amirite?

The patch was temporary.
"We can phase in a change later when the block limit is reached."
Bitcoin Cash lifted the cap and it works beautifully.
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:22:12
Blockstream happens to be co-founded by Core developers and employs Core developers.
Core was fine with big blocks until there was funding (of at least $76 million) to develop sidechain tech.
@_date: 2017-12-17 20:04:20
Bitcoin Cash already is the actual Bitcoin. 
Bcore already failed due to 1MB cap; it's unusable. (as their Blockstream investors intended, so, job well done Core)

@_date: 2017-12-17 18:56:15
Or.. Perhaps.. It makes more sense from a profitability point of view to keep mining Bitcoin Cash and not kill the goose with golden eggs? It's something Satoshi considered too. Read something.

@_date: 2017-12-17 19:06:50
Exactly. And if you don't believe in some parts of Satohi's vision (or worse, can't grasp it); you should fork off and create your own SegWitCoin instead of hijacking and transforming the vision amirite?
@_date: 2017-12-22 00:53:29
What bullshit is this? Bitcoin should just work without requiring every user to put a band-aid on it. Morons.
Try Bitcoin Cash. It just works; like satoshi intended and designed Bitcoin.

You failed to notice that financial institutions usurped crypto thanks to BlockstreamCore. Do you really think Blockstream investors / financial institutions will allow for the public to use crypto all willy nilly?
Me a shill? I've been right long enough in the past that i don't have to worry if things will go one way or the other from a financial perspective. My loathing of you and your ilk is purely personal.

SegWit was forced and you know it. It was also the most irresponsible politically motivated ugly hack in Bitcoin's history. But you probably already know that too.

The alternative is: "What bitcoins? I don't know what that is" or "oh, that wallet. Yeah i forgot the keys". I'm only taxable when converting to fiat. That's fine. Don't tax my bitcoin.

I did expect some constructive criticism, but instead everybody seems very concerned i make a few cents with it... Why is that? (Rest assured. It only costs me money.)

BCC is the original; as Satoshi envisioned it in his white paper. BTC is hijacked by it's developers and turned into something else.

No i mean Blockstream that seems to be hell bent to keep the blocksize small so they can implement their own sidechain "solution".
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:00:13
Care to discuss?
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:04:55
No. It's no rocket science. Read the original whitepaper and following discussions with Satoshi. It's solid.
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:05:42
So, you are telling me that core *wants* to remove the block size limit (that was implemented as a temporary solution); but some hardware manufacturer is keeping this from happening?
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:42:25
Yes. I am genuinely curious why you seem to believe it's a good idea to let Core implement Blockstream controlled sidechains.
@_date: 2017-05-04 01:17:15
I run some nodes. I don't mind it's not profitable. 
Please let me quote someone from in the thread with the same title i started on r/btc:
**Satoshi wanted: blocks to never be full, low fees, wait times of 10 minutes, nodes run in data centers, a decentralized system where users don't have to trust anyone specifically**
**Blockstream wants: blocks which are always full, unknown wait times, nodes run by every poor person with a crap computer in third world countries, expensive fees.**
(And let me add: a LN "solution" in control of a corporate entity)
**Very basic logic shows that Blockstream, and people like Adam and Greg, don't want Bitcoin, they just want to use the name and use it for their bank settlement system.**
This is the core of the "Core" issue.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:10:35
I hope it confirms soon! I already was cursing those Core morons when i had to wait for more than an hour once.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:42:30
Yes. I am genuinely curious why you seem to believe it's a good idea to let Core implement Blockstream controlled sidechains.
@_date: 2017-05-03 23:47:18
I do have a history of software development although not open (am developer). Could you please explain to me (If you don't want to waste time then perhaps just in a few words to point me in the right direction) why Core believes that blocksize should be kept as small as possible? 
@_date: 2017-05-04 00:22:46
I don't mean SegWit (It's useless and will not verify all signatures). I mean the logical and easy to implement solution Satoshi proposed; incremental blocksize.
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:44:58
Yes sure. SegWit and the Lightning Network are convoluted workarounds; The developers of Bitcoin Core are bought; they keep the blocksize small to push sidechains as a solution.
Bitcoin will do just fine with incremental blocksize as Satoshi proposed. But it needs to happen now because bitcoin is suffering. Current confirmation times are unacceptable and will only get worse. 
@_date: 2017-05-03 22:59:04
The Bitcoin block size is too small. The developers of Bitcoin Core are bought (Blockstream); they keep the blocksize small to push sidechains as a solution. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:50:20

@_date: 2017-05-04 00:57:42
Thank you very kindly. Transaction malleability is a unicorn and miners will always be running nodes; that does not make it less distributed. But i will carefully examine your points although i don't agree with them at first sight. Thank you.
@_date: 2017-07-23 20:14:57
You guys are laughable. How can you stand by a rule that forbids people to be well informed and have an opinion; and thus form the same consensus it's referring to?
I almost forgot how toxic this sub has become.
@_date: 2017-07-23 16:04:34
Because i believe that Bitcoin doesn't need convoluted workarounds to scale. 
I believe that a simple clean codebase and adjustable blocksize (as always intended) are the way to go for Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-23 13:28:17
