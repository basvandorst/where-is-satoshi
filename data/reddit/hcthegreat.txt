What's the advantage of this? I'm genuinely interested, but I really don't get it.
From the wikipedia page of the tonal system:


So not only would one have to use new letters everywhere, but one would need to change the value of 9 to ten?! One would also have to say ridiculous things like "mill-susanton-bong"...
What's the upside to this system? Are powers of sixteen somehow more intuitive than powers of ten?

You're right: world bandwidth use is absolutely relevant. 
However, the statement


is not quite correct, and it is sure to needlessly scare some people.
Total bandwidth scales with O(nm), where n is the number of transactions and m is the number of users, but the bandwidth for a single user scales with O(n). Even O(nm) is not quadratic growth, but merely bilinear: Either n or m can theoretically grow without the other.

Well, it is thought that Satoshi still owns the most coins, and one could say that he understands quite a lot about bitcoin ;-)
I don't think there is a good metric for "understanding". 
But people with more coins have more at stake, and their opinion should matter more. This is undeniably true, and it will be expressed in this way or another: E.g. they don't like the direction bitcoin is taking, so they sell all their coins.

So what would an ideal vote weighting scheme look like? 
@_date: 2015-06-11 21:52:19
He is right of course: We should do our best to achieve consensus. The problem is that there are many possibilities for raising the max block size (when, by how much, regularly or one-time, dynamically or not), and many different actors. Hell, not even "consensus" is clearly defined.
Has a bitcoin-address based voting system already been proposed? A poll is created, and everyone can vote, but you have to sign your vote with your private key(s). The poll results are then weighted by the number of bitcoins held by the addresses corresponding to the signing keys.
After one round of polling, the least-popular option in the poll is removed, and we go for another round of voting. We declare consensus when only two options are left and the winning option exceeds a pre-defined threshold, e.g. 80%.
Would be extra interesting if Satoshi participates in the poll with his ~1 million btc.

I know people are accusing Adam of putting Blockstream before bitcoin, or of having another hidden agenda. But I don't think that's the case. I think the reason for his reluctance to agree on a max block size increase is merely that he is being overly academic: He dislikes dumb, "kick the can down the road" solutions. On the other hand Mike is being very pragmatic and is frustrated with Adam's quibbles. This looks like a typical academia vs. industry difference.

Saying that bitcoin scales with O(n^2 ) is a bit misleading.
You can say that n is the number of users, and that the number of transactions are linear in the number of users, and that therefore the total amount of information to be propagated scales as O(n^2 ).
But this is misleading because this looks at the whole network. From the perspective of a single user, the amount of information to be processed and stored scales as O(n), where n is the number of transactions.

The lightbulb seems pointless to me. 
Would make much more sense to put ASICs into devices whose sole purpose is to convert electricity into heat, such as space heaters. Essentially replace an electrical resistance with a bitcoin mining ASIC. You still convert electricity to heat at 100% efficiency, so you lose nothing, and you gain a tiny amount of bitcoins.

No, I didn't. No one controls the money supply or the interest rate.
This voting mechanism is merely supposed to be a more efficient way of understanding the opinions of bitcoin users. Right now there is no efficient way of doing that.
And iterated voting might give us a tool that is helpful in achieving consensus. Everyone is of course free to not vote.

This does not make sense. You admit that fees are currently low:


If the block size increases a thousand-fold and the fees per transaction remain "trivial", you get a thousand times higher fees per block. Even if the fees per transaction drop ten-fold, you still get a hundred times more fees per block. Thus transactions can remain cheap and miners can still earn important fees.

This assumes the difficulty will just continue to increase by 15% every time there is a difficulty jump. At some point, this will not be the case anymore.
But even with 15% difficulty increments, the ASICMiner Tube (which is shipping now) at 9TH for 7.9btc (~$3700) is profitable. If you assume lower difficulty jumps, it's very profitable.
An top of that, there are probably going to be more efficient chips and cheaper miners soon.

Mining is still profitable for some people, so I wouldn't say it's currently a bubble.
Miners will stop adding GHs to the network if the price of running miners is larger than the rewards. This is not yet the case for good hardware. Probably we will exceed one exahash (assuming btc prices remain approximately constant) before that happens.

I agree with this. The opponents of a max block size increase mention possible increased centralization as a problem with bigger blocks.

If bitcoin starts to suck, it will be abandandoned, and then the centralization issue will seem very academic.

Yes, that was what I meant. The point is not to be profitable, but to not have to do anything, while still getting something out of it.

Off-chain transactions are not a perfect replacement for on-chain transactions. What is going to happen is that new users install a bitcoin client, try it, it will suck, and that's the first impression of bitcoin they will get.

If the power consumed by these chips is small enough, the user of the device might not care if he is mining at a loss.
I imagine a scenario in which every desktop computer has an ASIC that mines bitcoin, but consumes a very small amount of power, too low for the user of the desktop to notice the difference on his power bill. The user still gets a tiny amount of bitcoin, regularly, and effortlessly. He didn't have to go through the hassles of a bitcoin exchange, and he doesn't have to remember to buy bitcoins regularly. This added convenience might be worth the (tiny) loss of mining unprofitably.

Can anyone give more details about the "assumed-valid" blocks?
If I understand correctly, by default the software now assumes that a fairly recent block (mined shortly before release of the software) is assumed "valid" and skips the verification of the signatures of all the ancestors of this block, though the transaction data still has to be downloaded and checked for validity (e.g. no double spends etc). Is this correct? If so, I assume this means that far less CPU is used during the initial sync. Also, is there any major drawback in using this?

I have the impression that the opposing side uses an argument akin to "we don't need larger block now, so let's not rush things", see e.g. Jeff Garzik's comments.
The problem I see with this is that any change to the max block size has to be scheduled way ahead of time, e.g. one year down the road. A year is a long time to wait if at some point we really want larger blocks.

No. Just moving bitcoins around as quickly as possible does not give them value. Being a safe currency gives them value.

Didn't read the paper, only the medium article.
* In bitcoin, blocks have only one predecessor. In SPECTRE, blocks can have several predecessors.
* In bitcoin, a transaction can be considered "accepted by the network" if it is included in a block. In SPECTRE, this is not the case. The nodes run an algorithm (which looks relatively complicated to me) in order to decide which transaction is valid and which is not.
* Bitcoin is designed so that on average, one block is created every ten minutes. It is proposed that in SPECTRE several blocks could be produced every second. This would mean that users would know if their transaction was accepted by the network within a few seconds. Also the rewards received by miners would have much lower variance than in bitcoin. It is claimed that SPECTRE also helps with on-chain scalability, though this is not clear to me.

There is no doubt Szabo is an incredibly intelligent person. This is why I am absolutely baffled why he likes to use twitter so much. Twitter! All you can hope to achieve on that platform is to gain some attention, but interesting discussions are not possible.
Just look at this post: Szabo makes a vague comparison between the current max block size situation in bitcoin and (I think) one of the two space shuttle disasters. It's not exactly clear what the link is (there is no government agency making decisions in bitcoin), and there is no room on twitter to clarify things.

The article says: 


but this is simply incorrect. [Wuille's proposal]( calls for a 17.7% increase per year, starting from a year and a half from now. That makes a huge difference. Wuille's proposal only increases the max block size symbolically, but a 33% annual increase might indeed be more reasonable.
The article also says:


but this is also not true. It should have said "like expanding the **max** block size to 8 MB". The difference is important: Raising the max block size to 8MB overnight will not change the current ecosystem at all, since blocks are still below the current 1MB limit.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:55:45
Then as BIP 103, I propose to increase the max block size by 1MB every year and to start asap.
A linear growth in max block size should make the blockchain very manageable in the long term if hardware (memory, bandwidth, disks) keeps improving exponentially.
It is very slow growth, but it gives us a big relative (100%) increase now, when we most need it. And with a bit of luck (and a lot of hard work) it might be enough, long term, thanks to e.g. the lightning network.
I would hope the core devs could agree with this proposal.
@_date: 2015-08-18 15:01:56
Did I? What do you mean?
@_date: 2015-08-19 22:09:59
I have an idea for a "compromise solution" that 


which I have not seen anywhere: Increase the max block size by 1MB a year, for a hundred years. Start as soon as possible.
The idea of linear max block size increases might seem strange, yet it presents a number of advantages:
* We get a big relative (100%) increase in max block size now, when it is most needed (approaching the 1MB limit, no lightning network exists yet). 
* The first increase in max block size from 1MB to 2MB is relatively modest in absolute terms, and not too scary. 
* We never get mulit-GB max block sizes, which are scary.
* DRAM, bandwidth, and CPU speed are all expected to increase exponentially. If the max block size increases only linearly, in the long term it will become ever easier to handle the blockchain. Hence it is possible to get bigger and bigger blocks, yet the blockchain still becomes easier and easier to handle.
* It bitcoin keeps growing exponentially, this solution in itself will not be enough. There will still be pressure to develop things like the lightning network, but it buys us some time.
This seems like a good compromise to me, because it doesn't threaten the bitcoin network with either very large changes in max block size or extremely large blocks in the far future. Yet we still get an increase in block size that allows us to go on as usual for at least a bit longer.
I would personally prefer to see larger increases in the max block size, but at least with my linear block size increase proposal we won't have to wait until 2021 to get a 2MB max block size.
@_date: 2015-08-17 08:24:48
"Per law of minimum, the most relevant resources in Bitcoin block size debate are bandwidth bottlenecks &amp; DRAM costs, not average bandwidth."
What does he mean by bandwidth bottleneks? That upload speeds are not going to increase as fast as download speeds? Or that there will be places in the world where bandwidth is going to stagnate for a while? Or something else?
Regarding DRAM costs, am I correct in understanding that the required amount of memory depends mostly on the UTXO size? So the block size does not necessarily determine how much RAM you'll need. If you're worried about RAM, you should try to limit the UTXO size.
But still: You get roughly twice as much RAM every two years, for the same price.
Wuille's proposal gives us 2MB blocks only by around 2021. By then RAM will have become about 8 times cheaper than it is now.
"A rapid block size increase is a huge security risk: a reckless act to be performing on a $4 billion system." I don't know if this can be used as an argument. What is rapid, and what is not? Also, would it really be a huge security risk? This argument can easily be flipped around: It is reckless to impose a block size limit, since it is probably not really necessary and was intended to be removed anyway.
Finally, just saying we should think about Liebig's law of the minimum is not enough: it lacks specifics. Is the amount of RAM on a smartphone a limiting resource we should take into account when deciding about the max block size?
@_date: 2015-08-26 19:23:36
I think this is a pretty good plan:
* it doubles the max block size *now*, which is much much better than "2MB blocks by 2021".
* the max block size increases are not too big. Hopefully this means he can get other core devs on board. In particular, it completely prevents the multi-GB blocks that would be possible under Gavin's proposal and that seem to scare people off.
* If this goes into Core, it enormously reduces (or even eliminates) the risk of a XT hard fork in the near future. 
Sure, I would prefer bigger max blocks. But this is a perfectly reasonable proposal. If Adam can get other core devs on board, I'm all for it!

If you pay 10sat/b you run the risk that fees suddenly increase and that your transaction will not be included in a block for a long time. The people paying 1000sat/b might not be willing to take that risk. Maybe paying so much per transaction is worth it to them.
@_date: 2015-08-19 08:07:55


I think I read the same email you did, but I see no indication that this is the case. Consensus among developers is relatively unimportant anyway, what matters is consensus among users. As an extreme example, the developers might achieve consensus that it makes sense to change the rules so that the 21M bitcoin limit is raised, and that all bitcoins created above 21M are awarded to some hard-coded addresses belonging to the devs. This would be unlikely to achieve consensus among users, but might achieve consensus among the devs (it's good for them!).


There is no clear definition of consensus. Some number has to be chosen. Higher would be better, though, I agree.


I don't know what you mean. What is "the others"? Do you mean that the new XT chain will have no oversight from the Core chain? Or do you mean no oversight from the other (Core) developers?


You have to appreciate the irony, because this is the situation we are in right now: The Core developers are 'in power' and unwilling to raise the max block size at all (or only symbolically: "2MB blocks by 2021"). Yet, the barrier to doing a fork is very high.

Indeed in this article I do not take such a scenario into account.

No new bitcoins are created: you are trading your newly created altcoin coins for bitcoins, and someone else is doing the opposite.
Money can come seemingly out of nowhere because some people are willing to buy the altcoin, but not bitcoin. Therefore the value of the two chains post-fork (e.g. bitcoin plus bitcoin cash) can be higher than the value of bitcoin alone (pre-fork). Note that this is of course not necessarily the case: People might be overbuying now compared to after the fork, e.g. because they are overestimating how much "free money" they'll get.

Low likelihood of actually being him. 
* the email account could be hacked. This wouldn't be the first time one of Satoshi's email accounts have been [hacked](
* The logic is faulty: "When I designed Bitcoin, I designed it in such a way as to make future modifications to the consensus rules difficult without near unanimous agreement." This is still the case. If near unanimous agreement is reached for bigger blocks, we'll get bigger blocks. The "XT fork" will only happen if there is 75% approval. I doubt the real Satoshi would fail to understand that. 
* Comparing the language in this post to the original satoshi posts will prove to be a dead end. The corpus of data is too small and it would likely be easy to emulate Satoshi's language anyway.

Good question. A semi-log plot is useful if you're interested in percentage differences rather than absolute differences. E.g. the move from $1 to $10 takes up the same vertical space as the move from $1000 to $10000. Each 10x return will take up the same space on the y-axis if the y-axis is scaled logarithmically.
Since we are talking about bitcoin's price growth in percentage terms, it makes sense to use a log scale for the y axis.
If we didn't use a log scale in the y-axis, all we would see are the most recent price swings, as those are the biggest in absolute ($) terms.
It is a very common thing to do in science, and in fact sometimes even both axes are scaled logarithmically.

The alternative is: price growth continues with diminishing returns. This is 1. much simpler 2. in agreement with observations 3. already promises astronomically high bitcoin valuations in the not too distant future.

I seriously doubt that :)


Yes, and I also said: "It bitcoin keeps growing exponentially, this solution in itself will not be enough. There will still be pressure to develop things like the lightning network, but it buys us some time."
This solution is clearly not intended to be the ultimate solution, it's a "kick the can down the road" type of solution. But I already stated that clearly.
The idea is to 1) get some increase *now*, so that we can continue business as usual for a little bit, and 2) not have a max block size increase schedule that scares a lot of people.

That's what always disturbed me about this idea: It's unfalsifiable, and therefore not science, but religion. You can believe in it, you might not even be wrong, but we'll never know if you're right or wrong.

If you make a Linux fork, it will be "compatible" with Linux in most senses of that word. Bitcoin cash is not compatible with bitcoin in any way, it's a new coin. 
The Linux fork analogy just doesn't work.

Not true.

Somewhere between 15k and 200k by end of 2022 ;-)

It's not totally clear to me that both bands should be tapering, nor that they should be tapering in the same proportion. E.g. why not have a "normal mode" band that is just as wide as the "bull mode" band in the future?  
It is certainly possible that the support line gets a somewhat higher slope in the future, as you seem is likely, but for now I think it is too early to say.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:00:13
Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:52:36
Thanks!  
The power-law principle can actually be used to build an oscillator, which is helpful in timing the market. I'll probably write my next article about that.  
Good looking logarithmic regression bands :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 10:05:07
The assumption in the article is:
* halving 3 in May 2020
* halving 4 in approximately mid 2024
* halving 5 in approximately mid 2028
Hence by "A price that is lower than $150 000 until mid-2028" I meant "... until just before halving 5".
@_date: 2019-09-04 21:24:42
Actually part of the reason I like the power law model is its simplicity, precisely because it looks at just the data and doesn't use any assumptions such as "it's the scarcity that causes the price and not something else".
  
However, I also like the idea of incorporating scarcity into the model. The problem I had until now is that the stock to flow model tends to disagree with the power-law model in the long-term, but I think I found a way to reconcile the two, and intend to write about it.

No, that's not correct. Why would it be an obligation to pay back bitcoins that do not exist? That doesn't make sense. The obligation would be to pay back bitcoins that belong to other people, which you could obtain, e.g. by earning a salary, just like now.


Interest rates would go down. If the supply of loans is going up, other things being equal, rates will go down.

The original reddit post that inspired me to write this post can be [found here](  
The original was posted about a year ago. If anything, the model now holds up even better. My new article has a few additional insights.

Agreed, I also believe something like this could happen. This is an example of what I meant with "large exogenous shocks":

An oscillator cannot really make any predictions regarding future price... but it can give you a hint regarding whether to buy or sell at a given price.  
My last article is maybe more interesting if you're interested in speculative future prices:

@_date: 2018-07-24 13:21:12
Which part?
@_date: 2019-09-20 09:25:24
No it actually just keeps increasing, just slower. Not all slowing growth is asymptotic.
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:34:02
Indeed possible :)  
I'm somewhat confused regarding the relatively high price ("high" according to the model) at the end of this four year cycle. I'm not sure if this indicates a front-run or if the support line moved higher recently.
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:11:37
The predictions are admittedly broad. You are correct in saying that one way of reading these predictions is that bitcoin might not break 20k again until 2024 - but I think this is something any bitcoin investor should be mentally prepared for.   
You are saying that the bitcoin ecosystem is changing and hence this model might not hold in the future. But the ecosystem has always changed, yet the model tends to work better and better with time. Other such laws exist (e.g. Moore's law) which hold through time even though a lot of things change.
@_date: 2019-09-04 16:13:22
The stock-to-flow model is indeed interesting and I will write about it in the future.
@_date: 2019-09-05 05:38:40
Good point indeed.
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:42:39
Yes indeed, very interesting article! Thanks for this, I was not aware of the github repo.
I will probably write about the stock-to-flow article in my next article.

Which downtrend? All relevant metrics (number of transactions per day, number of of unique addresses used per day) keep going up. 
@_date: 2017-10-18 10:30:12


Sounds like hindsight bias. Do you have evidence to support that claim?
@_date: 2019-09-06 09:02:59
Yes, sorry: slower PRICE growth indeed.
@_date: 2019-09-04 12:53:25
This model doesn't say anything about the short term, so I can't say anything about rising wedges or RSI divergence :)
@_date: 2017-10-17 19:13:50


Those have nothing to do with bitcoin. 


This is admittedly unfortunate.
But I guess it makes sense that there are similarities between goldbugs and bitcoin enthusiasts. Bitcoin has desirable properties similar to gold, but can be sent trustlessly. That's quite a difference. I doubt there was the gold equivalent of SatoshiDice or the darknet markets, for example.
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:32:36
Here is what I wrote in the article regarding large exogenous shocks:


So, my gut feeling:   
If the next recession is severe enough, it might be more positive than negative for bitcoin.  
It would be bad for all other coins though, due to flight to safety.
@_date: 2019-09-05 04:41:20
Indeed this is possible. Total adaption is an example of something I called a "large exogenous shock" in the article though - an assumption I was not willing to make in that article:

Agreed! Even though these predictions are somewhat less rosy than the most extremely optimistic predictions, they're still quite rosy :)
@_date: 2019-09-20 11:30:36
Thank you very much :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 08:49:51
Actually, the growth is not exponential. It follows a power law. This means ever decreasing growth rates (instead of ever-increasing), until we see growth rates that are closer to traditional investments. [Paul Sztorc]( has a good argument why the price could indeed continue to rise forever.
I agree with you though that the exact timing should not be that important. Most important is that we get there at all.
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:56:13
Agreed.  
I like that you consider this model to be positive. Some might consider it negative because it predicts slowing growth instead of promising hyper-bitcoinization.
@_date: 2019-09-05 11:32:56
My pleasure!
@_date: 2015-09-04 08:24:46




What makes you say that?
@_date: 2019-09-05 07:36:31
Expected annual returns are still well above 50%. 


that's a scenario which is impossible according to this model. In 20 years, the price should be **at least** 1M according to this model.
@_date: 2019-09-05 05:39:53
The model makes no statement on this. My gut feeling says that yes, those two "mini-peaks" are similar. But I don't trust my gut and neither should you :)
@_date: 2019-09-05 16:24:07
According to the model, there is no "final" price. The price just keeps on increasing, but slower and slower.
Perhaps the swings will indeed become much less dramatic in the future. So far I don't think the data indicates that however, and this model relies purely on existing data - no extra assumptions.
@_date: 2015-09-21 08:06:34


I've seen this line of reasoning many times, yet it makes no sense. If you hope for higher transaction fees total, you should increase the max block size. Many transactions are more likely to pay a high total transaction fee than few transactions. This becomes obvious on both extreme sides (e.g. one transaction per block and billions of transactions per block).
@_date: 2019-09-04 15:54:01
only after infinite time though :)
@_date: 2019-09-04 13:25:54
\&gt; How is that?  
The coefficient of determination has increased over time.  
I am not arguing against the fact that the predictions are broad, but they are sufficiently precise to invalidate some predictions, like [McAfee's famous one]( or Roubini's prediction that it will head to 0 within five years.  
TA indeed uses price as input. But this model actually uses time, not price. 
Also, TA tends to be interested in shorter time scales. These predictions are broad, but long term.
@_date: 2015-03-19 20:37:15
This was great! Thanks for that.
@_date: 2015-10-20 17:00:58


So this essentially means that phone manufacturers / service providers would be mining with free electricity (the end-user pays for it). Essentially, you (the end-user) would be paying for the phone in part with electricity. Lower up-front cost for the phone, but the phone uses twice as much juice as a normal phone.
If this model really scales (why stop with phones?), it also means that the current big mining operations might become unprofitable, because they don't get their electricity for free. But of course, there are many variables at play.

What is your estimate regarding the ratio of "legitimate" transactions on the network vs. spam transactions?
@_date: 2015-10-11 09:09:46
That's not an adequate description of what happened at all. 
The bitcoin halving took place on Nov 28, 2012. And then, [here's what happened]( 
* Dec 2012: ~$15
* Jan 2013: A rally starts
* April 2013: Rally ends, topping out at ~$260
* May 2013: Price more or less stable around ~$100

I don't think that's right. If I recall correctly, Satoshi sent some coins to Gavin, who then sent them back to Satoshi (can't find a reference right now though, sorry). I presume there were more such "test" transactions.
@_date: 2015-11-10 10:41:44
As far as I understand it, this seems to attempt to solve the risk of a greater orphan rate due to larger blocks. It therefore only addresses one part of the scalability issue. The title ("solve bitcoin's scaling issues") is therefore misleading.
It also seems to me that this is an alternative to IBLTs, as both attempt to solve the same problem. However, IBLTs would require far fewer changes to bitcoin than this proposal.
Or did I miss something?
@_date: 2015-10-27 19:59:17
Why not? 
Your post title says:

So what you're saying is that the ideal medium of exchange would/should be something that stores no/almost no value. This would be illogical: It would not be money.
Sure, there might be more saving and less spending in bitcoin relative to strongly inflationary currencies (and that's a good thing). But there will still be spending, of course.

Almost certainly just luck, see  .
6 hour and 12 hour estimates do not really mean anything.
Better wait for a few days before jumping to conclusions.
