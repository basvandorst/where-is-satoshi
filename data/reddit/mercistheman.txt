Oil is no longer a primary reason for war... The days of sucking up to the Saudis is over... Even more so if a Democrat is elected.
My concern is what happens when the crude dependent countries continue to decline... Hostility against NATO alliance will elevate... Somehow this relates to Bitcoin :^)

I use CB on occasion... They are dangerously close to "bank" status... There's complying ... Then there's alienating your valued clients.

How do the fees compare to Coinbase?
@_date: 2018-01-14 23:04:37
Why wouldn't they drag their feet? They make a boat load from fees... Until recently they haven't had much pressure.
I wonder how many new customers they receive daily to offset the people jumping ship... It's probably going to take more than a petition and angry redditors to motivate them. A viable alternative being pumped by the media should have the best impact.
@_date: 2016-04-08 14:19:33
I tried this and got a negative rating for waiting 1 day after the purchase
@_date: 2016-04-24 03:43:11

It's still possible with bakkt onboarding.
To answer your question yes it is most likely a good entry price due to institutional interest that has yet to enter the market.
@_date: 2018-09-24 18:57:11
This does make you wonder what % of new buyers are from deception vs. actually knowing what BCH is.

You don't need to know about mining... just stick to the benefits of decentralized vs banking... some folks are not capable of simple explanations of benefits... they feel they need to flood with all of the technical details... ignore and move on to the next one.
Benefits include limited supply that is similar to gold... more likely to increase in value over the Feds printing money anytime they want (inflation).
Bitcoin is valuable for international communities that don't have banks... they can get involved in worldwide commerce... they can transfer money to their families for pennies vs high western union fees.
It has better security than centralized systems (think Home Depot, Target and any other central database that can be hacked effecting millions of their customers) ... because there are 1000's of people spread around the world verifying every transaction (ya can't hack em all at the same time :^)
You have 24/7 ability to buy &amp; sell vs banks.
For the getting started part my recommendation is to sign up with an insured exchange like coinbase or circle... once you've learn enough to secure your own coins (offline storage etc) then you can transfer to your own personal wallet.

@_date: 2016-03-08 03:03:41
I'm pretty sure that there are a significant populous among the community with substantial coins who are growing tired of the gridlock... we did not sign up for inflexible representation.
Rest assured that banks with their multi-million dollar blockchain developments are loving every minute of this negative press... when they finally achieve a workable solution for their clients it will be an easy sell when they can say "we can lower your current cost and scale unlike bitcoin" 
We're not afforded a long time to influence growth potential.
At the same time it's understandable that devs are trying to protect against centralization and hostile takeover... it's just that we as a community need to see working solutions sooner for us to maintain interest as a viable long term investment or there will be other options.

Um, it would be nice if folks would stop posting about bank cronies determining bitcoin's failure... some shallow people actually believe this crap and create a price drop.
If they want to convince themselves that there is nothing to worry about that should suit our community just fine... since they are stealing the technology we know they are indirectly endorsing the product. Why disturb their comfort level 
Of course these talking heads are gonna try to protect their ass(ets)... this should not be news or warrant banker fud to be dignified... nothing to see here...ZZZzzzz

All it takes is a power player (who is heavily invested in the media outlets) to send a directive for a new FUD message to be widely distributed... then it's sucked up like a trout on a hook by investment players... and poof BTC is now on the decline.
The goal should be changing minds from the scallywags that are successful at controlling reactions.

It seems people saying the price will not significantly increase in 2019 are being naive.
Bakkt &amp; Fidelity are not going to invest this amount of resources just to keep things the same. BTC will be heavily promoted. The increased PR will be like a built in marketing machine... Others will follow due to fomo. Naysayers will have a hard time removing all the egg from their faces.

There was mentioned from I believe Libratax that you don't have to pay taxes on FIFO... in other words you could match the sell with a buy of any purchase date as long as you don't use the same purchase again.
Anyone want to confirm or deny this?

Unfortunately China still dictates the market. Hoping for a big jump in India and Africa in 2017. We need global balance for stability.

When the government has stocks in M-pesa it reduces the likelihood that a new startup can compete... they will seek all avenues to restrict competition.

Anyone that has been in the game for a while sees this as a stable incline... the stability comes for wide spread international acceptance and tolerance from government's that were once opposed to the "key chain" (stolen from Andreas)  .

This would be an easy way for the banking industry (and others threaten) to initiate a negative PR on the community... Rest assured big money will be spent on image damage and lobbying for harsh controls.
At one time there was a bitcoin lobbyist group.. Have not heard of anything in over three years... It would benefit all to have an active committee.

This shouldn't be a problem as long as it's a reputable store... Simply reload the wallet.
BTC should be spent to help maintain public interest.
@_date: 2016-02-22 23:53:33
It's important for members to recognize blatant negativism towards Bitcoin... one has to ask why would anyone set up an account merely to start flame wars?
I usually ask them who's paying him to start dissent.

If both sides can agree that the community is more important than their own personal agenda there should be a union style meeting... starting with a vote on the significant attendees.

@_date: 2016-02-15 03:02:14

@_date: 2016-02-11 01:25:41
Can we get this out to media outlets... Potential for some big time cheap PR
@_date: 2016-02-22 19:40:07
There's nothing wrong with anyone expressing the opinion that benefits themselves/company...
NOBODY in our community wants bitcoin to fail... if this indecision creates desperate times then desperate measures will be endorsed.
Rushing to a solution that has a negative impact on a large segment promotes a split of our strength in numbers.
There could be a better solution arise in the short term that nobody knows as of today (how many saw segwit coming?).
Rather than trying to stifle opinions with aggressive hostility why not make this a fact finding discussion that promotes intelligent deliberation.
We all benefit by less bravado and more compromise.

His agenda in a nutshell... we'll build a wall... We hate foreigners... China should burn in hell... everything I do will be "GREAT" (repeat 1000 times and rinse).... I don't know about foreign policy, budgets, health care or civil rights but I do know some Generals and stuff.
This guy sounds like a bumbling idiot when asked about current issues... a legend in his own mind.

When I talk to friends &amp; family the sticking point is always how to secure their coins EASILY... Once you start with setting up the offline wallet the eyes glaze and all interest is lost.
If anyone has an EASY tutorial I'm all ears.

It should have been a Islam porn site... maybe we can shift their interest... cause they show nuff ain't actin' religious.

I'm not sure why anyone would pay over market when they can simply pay less at an exchange.

As a long time hodler I finally bit the sell curse to the tune of 2/3 of my coins when the Minor vs. segwit fiasco would not die... I'm sure a lot of investors fell into the "ah it will drop to an attractive price and I'll jump right back in" trap.... I mean who saw the Japan situation (along with several other variables)?
After resisting so many false reads the lesson could never be more clear about the shrinking value of fiat and desperate buyers.
It's time to lick the wounds and kick some greedy minors ass!

Don't recall any $400 a day swings... but yeah not much to get excited 'bout.
@_date: 2015-03-13 01:41:01
Good point... if this grows any legs I can see a lot of govt money promoting this... if they have any success bitcoin will go harder after the unbanked... bitcoin investors will work hard to keep their interest in tact... and people willing to look at the facts will understand the difference between "bank controlled" and "for the people"

It's not complicated... we know who pay the bills for the SEC

Couldn't get past "Corporate America" &amp; "Wallstreeet"... any real reason they should be trusted near our bitcoin?
@_date: 2016-05-05 23:42:59
Agree with these sentiments... nothing spells "trust" at this time.... be wary my friends.
Let's see a statement from MIT about their commitment to a decentralized future (ie. no influence from big money).

You mean it can possibly get slower :^)

If secured properly offline storage is less risk of theft than banks or cash.... and no officials will seize your coins.

If only it was as trustworthy as our banks and Federal reserve.

Most marketing campaigns start with a problem (high cost of fees and difficulty transmitting international)... then show the solution that saves time &amp; money... with BTC it's not a hard sell if you can simplify the process.
@_date: 2015-03-30 02:11:53
Yes bitpay is the trusted standard... if you're smart you'll not convert all your coins... there's a lot of exciting things in the marketplace that should drive the price up in the near future... this could be a nice added value for you.
@_date: 2015-03-03 23:55:31
LOL at anal folks taking positive news and turning it into a proper etiquette discussion.
Props to Canada... they welcome Andreas to talk with them and had the foresight to understand the growth opportunities without over regulating right away.
"Breaking" away from ridiculous pessimism.

What if some of these large mining farms are government sponsored?
They'd probably like to capture a large share of this market also.
@_date: 2016-05-13 12:44:38
Their support sucks... from my experience they are very unresponsive.
@_date: 2015-03-11 04:23:16

According to Kardashev Capital, they bid of $221.51 and did not win any coins.... so they went for near market value

Don't see a reason to go negative on this... more exposure won't hurt the price.

So who is there to represent our best interest?
There has to be an effective lobbying group or the banks win.

We have to come to grips with the fact that the average new user will sign with an exchange.
Traders may also prefer exchanges
We want better security to not scare off potential investors (we do want growth right?)... so what is the problem with one of our "options" trying to comply and reduce our risk.
Even though I don't use Coinbase I commend them for  trying to appease both sides... don't kid yourself for a minute... we need these guys to grow this thing we love.

This is all trumped up by CC companies &amp; Banks... they want a different set of rules so not to lose the advantage... these regulators should understand that this is an international currency that can take their business elsewhere... support it or be left behind.

It's easier to understand the value of this short exposure if you view it as a mind altering chisel. It's a form of subliminal ads... At some juncture the consumer reaches the tipping point of pulling the trigger with an exchange... Especially if they think they may be missing a special opportunity.
