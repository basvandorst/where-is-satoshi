Did the DEA not think to bring a spare battery for their laptop? During a critical point in their operation they almost run out of battery.

Well just had a reply from BS (within 2 hours!) and they said that any payments going to that account will be returned to the account of origin. So I'm hoping that I'll see the money appear in account in the next few days!
Just thought I'd update in-case someone does the same thing as me. Will update once everything is OK.
I've been into BTC since they where $1.50 each and this is probably the second mistake I've made with this amount of money. The other was sending .5btc a few months ago to an address I thought I still had the private keys for (goddamn labelling of addresses). Learn the hard way I guess...

I'm honestly not too sure it was word of mouth(I know not reliable) from either a rep at samsung (Also can be misrepresented) or a partner business. All I heard was 50Gb/s speeds which (as I would) think it was impressive. But my purpose there was to look at some new Laptops and some other tech for my business that could be of use. Maybe it's something that's pretty hush hush at the moment but now you've piqued my interest into looking into this further. It's late but if I get some time I'll see if I can find anything for you

Didn't i hear that samsung hit 50Gb/s with 5G last year in South Korea. Surely that could be a pretty big game changer in terms or mesh networking and affordability of such a network.

That's actually pretty genius. You could apply this to things like funded education. I'm imagining a Khan Academy type website where you could pay a monthly fee or a flat rate and get micro transactions for each task completed. Or put up hard problems with a bounty where you collaborate to solve the problem and based on what you contribute you get a fair percentage for your contribution.

Bitcoin the Bruce Lee of currencies.

Just no... This is the guy who is threatening porn sites to comply with some sort of advanced age verification system (registering credit cards for example). He's trying to censor the internet and trying to ban encryption citing the 'think of the children' and terrorism lines. I bet he just sat there and nodded his head and has no understanding how bitcoin works except 'magic internet money'.
@_date: 2015-07-31 19:14:40
I suppose it's the gesture of trying to get more people familiar with BTC since Patrick Byrne seems like a BTC enthusiast it seems like he could go for it. He's also a business man who understands that the sale is to get rid of stock quicker. Some people may not want BTC so your likely to always have the option to opt out but the exposure and opportunity is there if people have an interest but haven't got around to using an exchange, LB  or any of the other services.

I'm probably going to get flamed for this but I think the point is that tax is supposed to be a method a wealth redistribution. I get the point that taxes these days is quite literally stealing from the poor to give to the rich but it's worth bearing in mind that the idea is to create things that everyone needs for the benefit of society even if it has been (more) beneficial for governments and rulers in the past. 
You can probably argue successfully that we don't need governments to do this any more but this would have been very hard to imagine pre-bitcoin. The internet and digital technology has given us so much in the last 10-15 years that we can now think of ways for society to be self organising, self regulating and actually efficient. 
At the end of the day though the majority of the people in the world are either ignorant(that it's actually possible) of this or are too busy/comfy to do anything about it. I see the last big hurdle being our energy infrastructure.
@_date: 2015-07-31 16:28:13
Like 20% discount. You pay full price VIA traditional bank and get 20% back in BTC(kinda like store credit/loyalty cards but you can spend it elsewhere). Genius!

Alex Winters was on the latest(?) JRE, interesting watch. It seemed that he knew that there was some sort of corruption going on but he was not allowed to talk about it. Also he would have probably have to wait another year or so to get enough facts to put into the doc. He stated was pretty hard to cut because there's so many technical aspects involved with Tor, btc etc. It sounds like he wanted to make it accessible  to a broader audience.
@_date: 2015-04-01 18:27:11
Yup, you don't admit to being DEA and wanting a large transfer done without a government agency knowing. Maybe he thought all BTC users are criminals and he could get away with it? That's the only reason I can see why he would be so confident he could get away with it. TOR and BTC may have given him some amount of anonymity but wtf do you expect when you make the direct transfer to you bank account like he did. BS may have even thought it may have been a sting to test their KYC/AML.

Well this thread just got me accidentally replying to messages from buttcoin. Was wondering why the place got hostile all of a sudden...
@_date: 2015-04-01 19:04:08
Never actually realised that. Thanks for the correction and keep up the good work. I don't get all my info about Tor from the news btw . Maybe it was inception? So the BTC world is surprisingly anti Tor I take it if your involved in the project and making this statement. I have followed a lot of Jacobs talks since before Snowden(I think it was the UTAH data centre talk).
Edit: Words, some made no sense.

I'm not saying to get him involved but he was involved on DNM forums for harm reduction purposes. He may have some valuable insight on this sort of thing and is likely to be honest on the matter.
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:56:38
Thanks for the tip dude, I'll put it towards the devs after work. 
I agree with your points but honestly I fail to see how it is much different than asking a medical sub for advice in this aspect. If anyone's planning on taking a cut then they will pinned as a kingpin like Ross. Someone will come across and try and extort money (like that DEA agent) from the owner. Most DNMs are subject to scam due to the pressure, nature of the business etc. 
If it's decentralised then you mitigate the risks(like OB), then you need a team of expert programmers because as I understand it OB is not yet secure even if run through Tor. Like you said the majority of the public do not use crypto so your demographic is likely not too far off the people who use the DNMs as they are, at least in my opinion. I may be missing something here though, I came across this thread whilst waiting for a reply for an email...
Maybe get in touch with this doctor and ask his opinion. He's unlikely to approve the selling of prescriptions but he has knowledge of the DNMs. 
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:49:30
I imagine this is the right answer. People linking to the PDF. PDF in the title and link. That's damn impressive though...
@_date: 2015-04-01 13:34:18
I would even say people within the US. I know it wasn't registered as a money transmitter business so I guess you can forget the USD but BTC was totally unregulated at this point in time IIRC. There was Gox and Intersango where the first two exchanges that I remember and they both took pretty big risks getting involved in the scene where things were so unclear and from what was disclosed yesterday it seemed as if Karpeles was trying to establish BTC as a currency.
@_date: 2015-04-16 15:49:36
Isn't this a good thing though? It means that it's going to people outside of the sub possibly bringing more people into this sub and possibly sparking an interest in bitcoin.
Sure tips for good comments are worth it within the sub but it could probably be put to better use outside of the sub if mass adoption is the end goal otherwise it's one giant circle jerk...
@_date: 2015-04-14 19:30:54
It's still on the festival circuit right(I watched the Rogan episode last night)? He seemed like he is trying to get the general audience to understand privacy and the need for secure communication which is good, instead of focusing solely on all the DNMs and on the SR drama. Can't wait to see this doc...
@_date: 2015-04-16 20:28:20
Ah right, thanks for clarifying. I watched it a few nights ago. The documentary looks really interesting can't wait to see it. It's going to be interesting when all the facts come out(assuming they do - that didn't see to be the case in the SR trial).
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:27:55
This seems like a matter of time before someone gets locked up for this, at least the medication side of things. Everyone knows how the medical industry in places like Florida were run like pill mills. People are going to give doctors good ratings if they think that they will get what they want(whether the docs are legit or not). Sorry if I'm being cynical (and not saying that it shouldn't be done) but a precedent is being set with the SR trial and someone could go to jail for 'hacking' simply for creating this platform. 
You will have people screaming from the rooftops how their son/daughter had bought opiates from a highly reputable doctor and the doc needs to go to jail. Just my opinion but it seems like a easily abused system (you can even get LEGIT prescriptions online and there's a crackdown on that). Would Heroin(in the form of Diamorphine) be available for cancer patients and other opiates for chronic pain and how would this be prooved without a visit as the doctor could potentially be a long way away for a one to one? I can see how it could work for advice with a skype-like(but more secure obviously) setup for advice and non-prescription drugs though. A P2P advice network as you will, past that and I can see a load of legal trouble and doctors shying away because of this. It's not worth spending hundreds of thousands of dollars in college costs to get to that level to put yourself in a position where you could be guilty by association.
Not saying that it shouldn't be attempted but TBH it's not too far from Silk Road once you offer prescriptions(especially since it's medically targetted, OB would have broader categories and will have more of a chance at making a decent defense of the program just by saying 'well it's a free market for everything, not just drugs')...

Bought @ $1.70ish, after initially brushing it off before I looked into it, and cashed out half when the price more than doubled(during that $30 run up - broke even in a few weeks) and bought odd bits and pieces / cashed out for a little extra money, donated, bought Andreas' book, along with many others. Iv'e been spending a few hundred $s/month since it hit about $700 after the crash. Been keeping all my profits and savings in BTC and even if it did crash to $0 I've had my fun and would never have saved the money I put into BTC anyway(saving was always empty). Put in a fair amount, but I've made it back previously and I can't imagine me being down (all in all) if this experiment fails. 
I once owned more money than I would in 3 years of working full time in BTC and thought "nah not cashing out". It's driven me to look more in depth about BTC and the blockchain, learn more about finance, learn/practice more programming and try my hand at some of the online crypto courses for a better understanding(after allowing me to go part time). Even if it fails it's given me a LOT more than the unrealised gains so far, it's something that has renewed my vigour in the tech industry with all the crap that's come out over the last few years and that's why I wont cash out for any foreseeable reason. 
Granted I'm young(ish) and not financially struggling - meaning I pay for food, fuel, bills and my partying has decreased but it's been worth it, I get by without spending too much which is more than I can say before I got into this.

I think they imaged the server that SR sat on months before his arrest, which seems to suggest that the US Govt agencies can hack into whatever they want without consequence. When they arrested Ross he had the SR 'mastermind' (seriously) admin page open with his back to everyone in a public library which seems an extremely dangerous thing to do when you have a target on your back. The official story (I think) in regards to how they got access to the server was a captcha that leaked the servers IP although I think there's a it of a dispute over whether this is true or not.

Seems like a total clusterfuck doesn't it. But multiple murder for hire charges, were these officers involved in all of them? I keep hearing 5 charges but only ever hear details of the two. It does sound like entrapment to me but it doesn't really excuse murder for hire. 
It could be argued that one death could have possibly saved thousands of people from jail in the case of the one vendor releasing user info. It's not like Ross wouldn't have known the gravity of the situation or taken it lightly. I don't want to get involved in that conversation though to be honest because you can't justify murder but you also cant justify blackmail or throwing thousands of non-violent drug users in jail(assuming they are non-violent). It sounds like the 'murders' where actually the agents so it's even more conflicting and who knows what has been cherry picked to be released.
@_date: 2015-03-31 00:33:50
JS has been used to expose IPs of people visiting a paedophilia website IIRC(I remember something to do with freedom hosting). I understand that the TBB will only allow connections through TOR but JS can be exploited in many different ways being a client side scripting language. I'm not entirely sure how much the TBB has been updated since then but if you would want maximum security JS should be turned off, it's even acknowledged in the official FAQ.
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:09:26
Ah I see, thanks for the detailed answer, was much more than expected! I was under the impression TAILS was the golden standard for anonymity but TBH I haven't really used it as I'm constantly re-using USB sticks for different purposes in work so never bothered to set it up with a persistent volume(I seem to loose the decently sized ones that I buy...). I'll have to check out whonix when I have time, it does sounds interesting.

I'm pretty sure that reddit requires Javascript to post so he should be using a lot more than TOR. I hope you have your ass covered because it looks like they are leaving no stones unturned and even the forum mods are being put to trial. It's rediculous, but it's happenin
EDIT: I seem to be wrong I just disabled JS and it allowed me to post

He seems to be under a gag order. Read the OP in the link. Seems credible to me.
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:28:04
Has he formatted the PC? If so you MAY still be able to recover the wallet using recovery software. Normally these programs are looking for header(I believe) of a file. If he has formatted it you should image the drive and look into software like photorec.
Here's a link to BTCtalk if this is the case : 
@_date: 2015-03-31 01:21:45
Run it inside a vm over different vpns, proxies etc and your probably safe but we wouldn't want to give people the impression that running tor in windows with none of these is totally anonymous with any certainty. But yes, you are correct. Disabling JS is not necessarily a requirement for anonymity.
@_date: 2015-03-14 00:04:24
Not sure if this is any help for you(dont have time to read the whole paper atm) : 


The memory part in relation is the blockchain and the money is bitcoin. I'm fairly confident that the memory is referring to a banks ledger which SHOULD be kept balanced. In BTC this is enforced through code.

Ye you would think so  . Granted he was apparently being paid for being the mod which I guess technically makes him part of the conspiracy. And TBH how many un-constitutional events happened in the lead up to the SR bust and possibly during the trial? It sounds like a hell of a lot but (I'm not American BTW so maybe I'm wrong).
@_date: 2015-03-31 19:51:00
Most comprehensive thread on MtGox I can find - 
You know what, if I wanted to get information out to the public takes a guess at which immutable DB technology I would use. Karpeles was most likely monitored heavily over the last few years. We have a 9GAG link (which seems to be capitolized for good reason) as well as the rest of the information and theories in that post. I'm seriously wondering if there is anything hidden in the blockchain at this point in time with all the corruption being exposed. Although I have no idea where to start (nor the skill level or time... yet).
It looks like to me that a lot of the BTC community may well owe Mark an apology because something is very wrong here between this and the SR case...

Yes, brilliantly said! Just like you can create jewellery with gold, you can create so many useful things with bitcoin and blockchain technology. It's simply a token to publish to the network that is more powerful than the wolds supercomputers combined. How can that not be intrinsically valuable? 
Bitcoin may not be the one that wins over but it seems like it has a huge advantage at the moment. Gold is very very useful and it will definately be around in 4 years(WTF is he on about!?). He's just spouting some crap to back his own business and I think he really does see BTC as an alternative, he wouldn't keep talking about it otherwise. I suppose we dont actually know if BTC will be around in 4 years but it seems highly likely that some variant of it will.

It's like the DARE campaign but for bitcoin. Bitcoin just say no.
@_date: 2015-02-13 16:45:02
I see what your saying. The multisigs ensure that your BTC can then be recovered by yourself with your set of keys if they only hold one key of the three. I would assume if you have the gold delivered then you have to sign off the BTC so they have ownership of the coins. Also, if you reclaim the BTC then your certificate would be revoked. They could theoretically dilute the gold and create a fractional reserve based on gold. As long as you can trust the auditors the ensure this doesn't happen then it looks like a decent service.
This is how I assume the service works anyway.
@_date: 2013-07-04 22:29:14
Clever. Doesn't really concern me too much at the moment but for future reference thanks that's awesome. Still the majority of people are not going to go to that effort practically. Working supporting end users they (a large majority seemingly in my industry) don't want to learn more than they need to get by when it comes to tech.
I suppose it can be as anonymous as you need it to be but only if you know how.
@_date: 2013-07-04 21:26:27
I understand how TOR works but most bitcoin clients are not defaulted through TOR. When run through TOR I think that BTC is probably is as anonymous as possible (at the moment anyway).
I'm not sure if it's standard practice to use through TOR though. If you are not aware that for true anonymity you need to run it through TOR then you are traceable (even if it's a real pain in the ass to do so).
@_date: 2015-02-15 17:37:31
Where will the meetup be held, at the founders club (this place is new to me...)? I've been into, following and learning about bitcoin for the last few years back in the day where relatively very cheap (&lt; £1). Just bought Andreas' (among a few others in regards to cryptography in general) book to start learning to program with BTC and understand it more in depth. I would be interested and I'm sure a few friends would also like to come.
What's the commision on the machine set to?
Finally we get an an ATM in Wales!
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:48:22
Okay i stand corrected, the blockchain doesn't log your IP, but the link below suggests that it still is traceable due to the way that BTC clients use IRC to locate more nodes(I didn't know this) so even if the blockchain doesn't log your IP doesn't make it untraceable.
 
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:11:23
Blockchain.info contains relay IP's doesn't this make it traceable with casual use(no TOR)? Maybe not your IP but a starting point to work backwards? TBH I've never examined the blockchain but i was under the impression that it is somewhat possible to trace transactions. I could be completely wrong here.
@_date: 2013-07-04 20:27:42
Interesting. Pretty cool you where working on ecash. I suppose the paper makes no reference to P2P and you are right it is just someone (probably a small group) of people brought them together. I THINK the paper was from 1996 that's why it caught my interest. 
I know of some of the other protocols built into bitcoin. Are you saying that these other protocols could be exploited or that the protocol is designed in a way that's seemingly fool proof?
@_date: 2013-07-04 19:15:12
It does say that the third part is "a financial network with whom both Alice and Bob have accounts. We will informally refer to the financial network as the Bank.". Perhaps they hadn't figured that that was the blockchain itself or just disregarded the last ingredient if you will. 
I'm reading through the paper now. Still haven't finished but thought it was interesting... They where looking for a anonymous payment method that's untraceable. That's not unlike bitcoin at all.
EDIT: Network - blockchain. Finished reading the paper and I don't think it's too far off. The blockchain does the work of the bank but the paper does refer to being able to uncover the users identity in the event of a crime. Considering all the other information they may be keeping on you it may be quite easy to identify as the blockchain does contain your IP address that is unless your running it through TOR...
@_date: 2013-07-04 21:47:25
I don't think the NSA created bitcoin. I did read a rumor that it was Edward Snowden which is probably BS (but it would be really cool).
As 17chk4u said it's simply an integration of ideas and technologies of the time. I just thought that it was pretty damn interesting that there's a NSA paper going back to 1996 regarding cryptocurrencies. But then TBH I only stumbled across bitcoin a few years ago and managed to get a few when they crashed from $30 down to below $10 for a good while. I was unaware of how much work was being done to create an anonymous digital currency I suppose.
The only way I could see it being affiliated with the NSA would be if government agencies wanted to maybe launder some money and built from that paper and realised that a central authority is a flaw when it comes to anonymity. I'm hoping it was just some good people with good intentions though...
