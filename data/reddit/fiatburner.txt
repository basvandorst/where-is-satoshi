The Copay app offers the ability to add messages to transactions. Do these messages carry over to that exportable report?  Tax CPA here, trying to figure out how much hell it is going to be when these reports start rolling in. :-P I can use my report for the CoPay app to take a look when I get home from work, is the BitPay app's report the same?
Also, thanks again for all your contributions. Used the CoPay app for a speech/demo I gave my firm earlier this week and use Bitcore for my personal pet projects.

At my last bitcoin meetup, there was a guy from Venezuela.  Obviously he's familiar with Bitcoin (being at the meet up); but, he gave a pretty positive outlook for bitcoin in Venezuela.  Highlighted that they are big buyers/users of it. Also, some commentary on how young people know and understand the technology but the old people still have all the money and are getting anxious to learn.  Nothing like a little economic collapse to bring people together.

Wow... Didn't realize their healthcare system was basically shutting down as well.  This one hit me right in the feels. 
"One user, Eli, a 33-year shoe store owner, said he uses the digital currency to buy medicine for his mother’s bone cancer. He sells bitcoins to a friend in Colombia who buys cancer treatment and medical supplies when he comes to visit."

If they can get [foreign banks to pony up info]( coinbase will probably be spilling the beans before too long. They aren't going to fall on a sword for you.

Beat me to it, that's what I get for reading the article before the reddit comments.  This feels like the scene in The Big Short where they realize if they are right and make a lot of money from shorting mortgages... a lot of everyday people will be suffering.

Still trying to get my head around the specifics of mining; but, is it possible that they find a block and begin to mine on top of that new block without releasing it to the network, even if just for a minute or two giving them a jump start on the other miners?  With ~20% hash power, the network without them mining the same block would take slightly longer than 10 mins to find the next block on average.
In the event another miner finds a block before they release their first block, the race is on. They release the block without any transactions so it is lighter and propagates slightly faster.
Anyone have a good database for who found which block?  If the above checks out, I would expect them to find two blocks in a row more often than they should statistically.

Giving a speech on Monday at my firm to drop some knowledge; all I can think of is this video.

Local to Atlanta and would like to meet you guys, so my question: Any of you up for grabbing a beer next week? First round on me.
Also, does the wallet offer any sort of help tracking gain/loss for tax purposes?  Is there a way to indicate which transactions are transfers not sales or any way to adjust basis for coins transferred in?
