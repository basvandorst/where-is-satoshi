It was distributed through Captcha verifications that were open to the public, and I believe the devs retained 5% as their fund. I think the majority of it initially went to a lot of people in underdeveloped countries.
There's no central coordinator, it's an open source project. I've been able to test all of the different beta wallets including the Canoe wallet, and they work really well.
It's definitely not a shitcoin, but its future success would rely on node optimisation to ensure the costs don't exceed the benefits of no fee's etc.

I'm not technically the best person to answer this but I know that the "work" involved in the Cryptographic sense is only conducted by the sending and receiving parties- so the nodes themselves are watching and voting with pretty much no processing power required. For an exchange you would probably employ at least a few nodes to handle a decent throughput but for p2p it would easily scale. The only issue I guess is bandwidth usage when you scale up- but I believe they are addressing that with the introduction of 'universal blocks' and the ability to 'prune' nodes. There's probably a much more technical analysis that somebody can give you, I will ask around for you.

DAG Coins like Nano

You should tell her about Nano. You can power the entire network with a single wind turbine.

But some of the better fee-less alts stand to be far more decentralised than Bitcoin has or will ever be, without needing second layers - people need to move on and stop trying to “fix” it IMO

What kind of punishment is available for SWATting? Given the potentially lethal consequences, I would hope it’s on some kind of level comparable with pre-meditated murder. I also hope there’s a high profile example made of someone.
