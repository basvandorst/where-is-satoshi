My apologies - I thought you were wanting it to support automatic channel management in general. You're probably looking for something like this:  - There's a download link for macOS, linux, and windows on the 'Releases' page.

Shouldn't the real question be what are you paying in *satoshis per byte*, not fiat? The network itself literally has no concept of the dollar value associated with a single satoshi, which is the real metric used in transactions. The fact fees would be higher is simply due to the fact the fiat equivalent has risen.

haha yep

What bothers me about the big block argument is that *at best*, the network will simply be keeping pace with the rate of innovation of the systems that support it. Why can't we actually *engineer* a better system that is scalable, and resistant to any concerns over cheap, reliable access to bandwidth and processing power? Beat the curve, don't just chase it.

That's really interesting. Do we have an archive of that comment thread suggesting renaming to "bitcoin"?

Show us your commits to the project. Really. I'd love to see them. Otherwise, shut the fuck up, stop pretending like bitcoin is a product you are sold and actually *contribute something*. This isn't a coffee payment network. This isn't a get rich quick scheme. This is the fucking future of finance and money as we know it. For fucks sake people, it takes time to do the right thing.

This. Plus, a medium of exchange is worthless if the underlying asset can't store value over time.

I agree it's silly, but you'd be surprised. I would argue most second year comp sci students haven't the faintest idea of what it means to run truly fault tolerant and highly available code. You usually have to fail in a real production environment before you learn this lesson. My fuck-ups have certainly made me a better developer, and they didn't occur in school. I now know, in a very real way, what *not* to do. University can only get you so far.
On the other hand, I've seen senior level *architects* push bad code. It happens.
But, again, I agree this could have been avoided with better coding practices and that we need an extreme level of care when developing software that people tie their financial futures to.

Just report the sales. I don't want to lead you down the wrong path, but I'm fairly confident you don't have to report purchases. As far as the IRS is concerned, you shoved that money under a mattress. They only care if you take a profit or loss on a sale.
@_date: 2017-03-14 01:27:45
It's a pretty high risk tolerance to announce you have over $100,000 in a digital asset. It always amazes me when people are willing to state what they have like that. You don't have to "prove" anything to anyone. Based on that alone, you made the right decision for yourself. This counter-post isn't worth your time.

You're complaining about BU posts and this issue is less than 24 hours old? It's obviously a big part of what's going on in the community right now. Go outside. Come back in a week.

Robust code shouldn't even exit. Or, if it does, there had better be some supervisor process running to bring the process back up, and even that software can be prone to failure. End the transaction, log the error, alert a sysadmin automatically, handle the error sanely, and move on. Killing the server silently is a bad decision in software that is intended to be highly available and fault tolerant. We have patterns to deal with this.

Nope. Sorry, I don't need to believe someone else thinks it's valuable. I've got enough of that on my own. Obviously a shared hallucination is why *any* currency has value. But I didn't buy into it to trade. I bought into it so I can use it.
As to the rest of your post: lol. As if having an "infinite" amount of altcoins means that every retailer and individual must accept them.

Except that after a coin's hard-fork, there's no chance someone is going to hold a gun to your head, telling you to use one or the other. Civil wars can certainly end that way.

The argument against big blocks doesn't have much to do with disk space, as it really is the cheapest aspect of running a full node. The concern is bandwidth and time to validate blocks. Take BCH's scaling "solution" to the logical extreme and you've got 10+ GB blocks to reach global scale. Consider how much work a single node has to do to download a single block of that size from multiple peers, validate it, and relay it on to other peers, within a 10 minute window.

The channel is _anchored_ to the chain, i.e. layer 1. In the event of a hardfork, you now have two channels open you must manage, since the UTXO set from the original chain is now technically part of the new chain.

Why the fuck do we care so much about this? It's like it's news big banks and authorities talk out of both sides of their mouth. Who here honestly gives a shit? If they keep buying BTC for themselves, or on behalf of their clients, then *good*. The only way I can see someone here actually caring is if you bank with JPM or use them as an asset broker. And if so, then use your freedom of choice, and go somewhere else for fucks sake.
edit: If your complaint is "market manipulation", that is a valid concern. But look, we're on the path to recovery and we should all already realize these dips and recoveries will continue to happen for a long time. You all know this.

But they aren't committing fraud. The thing people seem to be missing is that it doesn't actually matter what Dimon says, *until it actually affects regulation*.
If you are calling for some resignation or lawful action against JPM here, *you* are agreeing to the statement of fraud. It's not fraud until it is. Who cares what one asshole says?

Smart contracts as they are currently thought of are generally credited to Nick Szabo. He wrote about them in 1996. [Wikipedia citation](
@_date: 2017-09-17 16:04:42


Never said it did.


My understanding is the buys we're seeing under JPM are for ETFs where they are legal. Just because the CEO gets up and spouts ignorant bullshit doesn't mean an entire regulatory framework surrounding legally acquiring bitcoin will be flipped overnight.

For advanced users, these techniques are probably fine, *for the most part.* There is something to be said for securely generating and storing keys on dedicated hardware.

Why are we expecting ethical behavior out of these organizations? Did I miss a memo? It just seems like everyone is losing their shit over something we would expect *any* banker to say, especially in casual conversation. Granted, Dimon's interview was not that, but time and time again, bitcoin recovers.
Let's give ourselves a big ol' slap on the back for finding yet another case of authoritarian hypocrisy and move the fuck on. This will do nothing to hurt the long term success of bitcoin.

Exactly, using price alone to disprove "fraud" is an extremely weak argument. Even people who claim it's a bubble have said it may not pop until $100K+. Point is, the tech is what really matters, not price.

Neither are. Sybil attacks are a concern if you *don't* have a protection like this in place and you unknowingly connect to bad nodes.

He likely meant traders that work directly for JPMorgan, where the profits go to them alone. What we're seeing are *brokers* who buy what their clients want.

No. These are still accessible by the software running on your computer. Hardware wallets have very strict protocols that prevent private keys from leaving the device.

I can't stand Ver as much as the next person on this sub so I agree with you there, but it makes zero sense to say the network "owns" bitcoin. Ownership here implies some kind of legally recognized action can be taken to prevent people from using it. Owning my house implies I have the right to prevent you from entering.
Bitcoin doesn't have this property, and that's the entire point. Just because we're both participants in the network doesn't mean I can do something with your bitcoin you don't authorize.
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:57:17
Fucking ridiculous. I can't stand bcash but seriously, how is anyone going to enforce this? The bitcoin "brand" is an _idea_. No one owns it. Even if you could make a legal case Satoshi does, I'd put down a McAfee-level bet they wouldn't come forward for this bullshit. And exactly how are you going to quantify damages? How many bitcoin holders are going to let a lawyer dig through their transaction history?

Besides the insane price tag he suggests just to *validate blocks*, the ignorance really comes from this assumption that everyone in bitcoin that wants to help support the network was in it from day one and thus can "afford it". This guy's pseudo-intellectual elitism is staggering.
@_date: 2017-06-13 06:38:51
While I question ETH's viability as a currency, I disagree with your conclusion.
Ether is required to run contracts so you can provide a guarantee the code will actually stop execution at some point during a transaction. Since there is no generalized solution to this (see: halting problem), we have to make computation **cost** something. This incentivizes miners to offer their computational resources (electricity, storage, administration) in such a way they won't be stuck running an intentional infinite loop, and receive ether in return (which they can use elsewhere, or sell for BTC, whatever). It also incentivizes programmers to write more efficient (cheaper) code.
There is serious tech here. That's why I prefer to focus on that, not the economics. I'm just waiting for the ICO circlejerk to wrap up so we can get to the real applications.
@_date: 2017-06-30 23:54:24
This guy seems like the type of guy that would try to shove that fact into everyone's face if that was true, in a sad attempt at an appeal to authority.
