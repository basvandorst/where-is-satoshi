Can't say I even watched the video, but for one thing have a bit more control over what they do have. It might be a good way to set emergency money aside or save it in case they're worried about being charged with something they didn't see coming. Or maybe send/ receive from a family member working over seas. No matter what its not going to be easy if you don't have a lot of money but i think bitcoin at least offers a bit more leeway. But that said, if less fortunate people don't really need to send it anywhere and need it for necessities, I don't think bitcoin is the right option.

Plus drugs are different for most people. Personally, I am very confident driving after smoking marijuana (Not saying I should). At the same tome I've had first hand accounts of friends who can't and decide to let me drive. Maybe some people can't even handle driving with nicotine or caffeine in their system.

Sorry if you saw it already but there was a post today about an app that turns your phone/device into an "atm". I didn't look that far into it but it seemed kinda cool and might be more what youre looking for.

Yes, I am young. Sure I have a good cushion as of now, but that will quickly change when I graduate. You say it will be all up to me, but criticize me for doing exactly that. I'm looking out for myself now. I am investing in bitcoin. Nor do I care if you're wrong, but there is a big difference between investing and gambling. Especially investing in bitcoin long term. Bitcoin does not depend on luck chance.

Totally agree but then we'd have to decide what are and aren't really going to be cconsidered drugs. It's a hard question and there probably isn't a right answer to it. Better safe than sorry though.  I was just trying to explain this to jaspita in a broad way because it seemed like they had no clue of the dangers of driving on any sort of drug which is pretty ignorant.

Very well said, thanks! I will have to simplify some, but ill be sure to use some of your points.
@_date: 2014-07-09 11:50:19
Thank you I appreciate your advice and will definitely keep it in mind. And youre right, i do have a chance to get by with little money at least this summer and I may be stubborned, but i don't really want that. It can be stressful, I feel like a lot of kids my age (I'm 20) now are fine with just coasting off their parents and I just don't get it. So I've been working every day so since june 20 at either of my 2 jobs and looking for things I can do to get ahead. I put the paycheck from one into Bitcoin each week and the other goes to the bank. Yeah I don't really have a lot to lose but it'll be harder to move ahead. And if i do lose it at least i can take it as a lesson. Im a business major so I consider this my first decent investment. It feels pretty good in a way to make moves of my own. Anyway thanks again! I may have gotten a little off topic hah

Who says the free market won't provide things like roads. If someone sees an opportunity to profit from building a road, I beleive someone will. Or what if there was a kickstarter type program but with city needs. Whichever one gets most donations (so it has most public interest) is the one that gets built. I really think people can work together better and more efficiently instead of the govt spending our money on things we are not interested in. We just have to get off our asses and stop letting them do everything for us.

No, you're right.  Of course bills and necessities come first. It just bothers me when I hear all this talk about taking Bitcoin to the moon , yet they're wondering why it's not taking off when they're only using it for porn subscriptions and comfort shopping.

Hah sorry I wasn't bragging about that at all. I was hoping that would let people understand I'm still trying to learn economics. And if I didn't say it about a hundred times, I'm not trying to influence anyone to make decisions either way. You're negative comment is adding nothing to this discussion. On top of that, you aren't specifying what aspect of economics that I fail to understand.

Little to lose now? Man that's all I got. You think i want to live with my parents. That's rent, food, gas, college debt and all other costs of living ill get once i finish college. I feel like Im taking the biggest chance. Look at all that great stuff you have. I mean i dont know whats going to happen when i get out of college. Im 2 years away from graduating and still dont know exactly what i want to do. Im fairly confident in my abilities that i can get a job and get by (speaking for most others in my situation) but you dont think the first thing i want to do is get the hell out of my parents house? Yea i probably should be saving but man if theres some chance bitcoin can help out a bit while actually serving a good purpose in the world then im behind it. But let me tell you, i have plenty to risk. My future, my freedom. You dont need to risk much, you all are starting to sound greedy. I just want something i can call my own, that i created myself. Sure my parents provide for me but they left no college fund and im expecting no help when i graduate. So im gonna take this risk. And probably many more to come. I am a business major after all. That said, i wish you luck! Hope everything in your life goes great! Dont forget to appreciate what you have :)

Damn, Bitcoin just makes me want to travel. Once it has so time to spread I think we're going to see that we can really be connected through a global currency. There's something about the fact that everyone could potentially value bitcoin. I can't help but imagine how much closer the people of the world will become with the ability now to trade directly with another person, no matter where you are from. It feels like we will start to resume actual trading. Money has been getting to complicated and it doesn't feel like it has worth anymore. Even though the technology is great, it's really a primitive form of trade.

Driving a vehicle is already so much of a hazard that I think we take way too lightly. It's risky enough driving sober. Why would you think allowing people to drive influenced by drugs, no matter how mild they are, would be a good idea? It's completely different than taking drugs in a safe environment. If you chose to do drugs, that's fine with me. But the point is, drugs alter your mindstate, so you're not thinking normally. That means you may be distracted, lose motor skill and reflexes, or make judgements that you normally would not make. Exactly, other things in life are very dangerous. There is no need to put other people at a higher risk by making poor decisions like driving.
@_date: 2014-07-09 05:12:29
Honestly dude fuck your mindset. We will change things. Our generation will be like none ever before. With the internet we expose how much fucked up shit that has been covered up by older generations and we choose not to go down the same corrupt path paved with the remnants of the earths resources that the savages of earlier generations left behind. We will make our own jobs cleaning up your (assuming your an older gen, my appologies if not) blundena and trying to build the world that everyone, includding the planet itself deserves and not just the selfish greed driven men of the past. I dont give a fuck if bitcoin helps or not. We are better. And our attitudes will takes us to places youve never seen. And if you dont want to see it then get the fuck out of here your time is done.

The decisions I make now are the most important. They determine how I will live in the future, what skills I've learned, and how to keep moving forward with what I have. I could easily put this money into something valuable to me now. I'm choosing to put my personal wants of the present on hold, to hopefully have the time, finances, and knowledge to succeed. You can't exactly tell me the risks I take now have no harm on me. I understand I don't have many financial responsibilities. If anything, I think I'm being more responsible.

@_date: 2014-10-21 02:36:29
Well why are they investing in the first place? If they don't want to put time or effort in, what are they expecting to gain from this? With little at risk, there is little incentive to stay in it for the reward. This is starting to sound like people just want to coast on the price rise. Or are simply bored and want something to watch to entertain them. If they want their money to actually help a cause they should put it to charity, not bitcoin.

Even though I mostly agree, it's funny that what we think as a "trusted" money transfer is the one that is guaranteed to steal (some of) your money.
@_date: 2014-10-21 02:25:13
Right. However, couldn't this be a bad thing? People don't care if bitcoin is successful or not because they won't be affected by it's failure. To me, this is not a good base for a currency, or any other institution to begin on.

I do see your points. If people have more money invested, they'd be more likely to panic buy/sell. I just feel people want bitcoin to explode and get to the masses as fast as they can. We're waiting for it to become easy to use and super valuable, but it just doesn't seem there's an equal number putting their money where their mouth is. I think we should be rooted in reality and make things happen. 
@_date: 2014-10-07 00:21:50
Perfect, I will use that to give the other side to the video as well, since we must be impartial. It's depressing though, really. We have the technology right here in front of us, yet we can't tap its full potential. Most of the problem is that simply not enough demand by people, even though it can solve their problems. Hopefully the technology itself can stand alone long enough to really peak human interest. It would be a shame for it to go to waste (even though I like to believe we're passed that point already!)
