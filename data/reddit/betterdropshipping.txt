Good news, BTC is nearly a bargain again.

My favorite meme on here is the "If users invested $100 in Bitcoin on the day the sub started they would have _________ today."

Yes you did, no you didn't, of course you do, no it's not, nothing.

Everyone stop, Paypal has been right under our noses the whole time!
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:29:40
This is absolutely correct.

No matter what Bitcoin is worth they will have always missed the boat at 3 million % profit and it angers them so.

Longer, 2012 I think.

Have you been doing that since 2009 because if so...
@_date: 2018-07-17 18:08:53
What happened?
@_date: 2018-07-16 10:45:59
Of course it's worth it. Name another more promising market.

Ever heard of short positions closing? 
Ever heard of this making the price increase which closes more shorts? 
Ever had a coherent thought at all?

They all suck, what's your point? Long sentences for things like facilitating the sale of any drugs all over the world that have left a trail of death and violence unmatched by most...  Those are fine.

Bitcoin could be popular as currency but the idealist / purist Bitcoin fanatics argue and fucking argue with anyone suggesting making it more palatable to the mass market. Retailers would take Bitcoin over other payments **if only for the no chargebacks benefit** but that would require a safe third party to handle it. Nobody wants to lose $5000 by missing an A on a long ass string or pasting the wrong address.

What? The entire market is fucking speculation now. When I first came to this sub nearly everyone was pushing for utility and now everyone here has jumped on the crazy train driven by a retarded sadist. Nobody even gives a flying fuck about spending Bitcoin now, they just want to make magic free money and don't realize they are the pawns being manipulated by big money. Didn't see that in the white paper.

Don't worry.
