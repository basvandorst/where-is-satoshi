why are you guys mining litecoin, is it more profitable then bitcoin mining ?
I have a 5850 (360 mhash) and a 7870 (~440 mhash) and I get about 0.05 btc/daily at the current difficulty, it's not a lot but at today's price... it's actually not bad at all. 
Even at 200$ it's still 10$/day = 300$/month.
How much money can you make out of litecoin mining ? (honest question, I really don't know)

I made 2$ in about 20 minutes... Unfortunately I only did a single trade today :-) 
P.S: I recently checked my mtgox history... I was daytrading back in 2011 at 3-4$ right after the crash, oh God... If I only knew this day will come...

I'm 100% sure that the Chinese government doesn't support bitcoin... but I don't think it's bothered by it... 
On the other hand bitcoin is something that chinese people should want, they love cash and don't trust banks... and they have a lot of cheap hardware laying around... of course they love bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-11 20:07:49
to make a few bucks... and that's pretty much what I did...
I checked out ~300$ back in 2011, I started mining again around december I guess, and I now have ~700$ in my mtgox account (out of all the bad deals I made in the past I think today I made a good deal selling at 168).
The drug thingy... well that was the part of the bitcoin that I did understand and that gave me confidence. I was like "look, these people will need to get their drugs &amp; weapons, in order to get them online (and what kind of self respecting junkie would want to leave the house for some drugs) they need bitcoins, let's keep everybody happy and make a dollar on the side".
I also have a similar theory that might explain the recent spike in bitcoin prices. Drug &amp; weapon dealers on silk road &amp; similar markets are chips and change, but I bet there's another use for bitcoin (I have no proof that it's already used like that, but hell, I would use it like that if I was in the position to do it): Let's say you wanna bribe some high level politician. How do you do that ? You take a suitcase full of cash ? Way to suspicious plus the politician might suspect a trap. You wire him (or even one of his many companies) millions of dollars ? Are you insane ? No, you just buy a lot of bitcoins and send those bitcoin to an anonymous address. It's perfect. On the other hand this could cause spikes and crashes: you buy the bitcoins in order to make the deal with the politician you drive the price into the sky, the politician cashes out &gt; crash...

Have you overclocked it ? If yes how much ? what parameters are you using ? what manufacturer ?

Oooh, that's even worse... so you don't have any cash in your mtgox/btc-e/other exchange account so you could profit from this DDoS... 
P.S: I also spent money only on mining hardware, and yeah, mining since 2011 it already payed off, but you have to be a fool not to keep USD in your mtgox account waiting for stuff like this.
@_date: 2013-08-29 08:42:21
I seriously don't understand why anybody would want to buy these... Even at the new price if you do a quick check here:  you'll see that in the best case scenario you'll get your money back in ~6-7 months and then it's gonna stop making any profit (or even if it does, let's say the price of bitcoin doubles in this timeframe) it's gonna be peanuts money (in march-april 2014 you'll be making less than 20$ IF bitcoin is 260$)
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:34:11
That is a great idea... but in order to be able to pay with bitcoins on pornsites instantly, and in order to do that you need to be able to buy bitcoins instantly. No, I shouldn't need to do a wire transfer to mtgox or some other exchange in oreder to buy bitcoins... I should have an "add to cart" and "buy" options to pay with credit cards or paypal.

If you have a few high capacity mining rigs, a few gigahashes let's say. Your chances of solving one block are quite small because you have to compete with the pools who have a LOT more power than you do. What do you do to increase your chances of getting blocks ? you DDoS the mining pools.

My calculations were based on  data from (mining.thegenesisblock.com - i also posted the link) and it was for ONE erupter (of course you can multiply my calculations with as many erupters as you want.
Oh, and are you sure about those numbers (one btc every 2-3 days ?) I had a 7870 running at over 400 Mhash/s up untill a weerk or so... When I stopped mining I was getting ~0.0025/day... since then dificulty increased, and two erupters should run at ~700 Mhash/s...

Aaand you're wrong ! It's a lot better to have something that draws a gazzilion wats but makes a shitload of bitcoins than to have something that runs on air but makes tiny amounts of bitcoin.
First of all, don't kid yourself about the difficulty, it will go up exponentially for a while, and it will constantly go up at least until ASICS don't get at least 28 Nm technology (probably beyond that point we're not gonna be able to realistically push out more GH out of technology). When I started mining I was making ~1 bitcoin a day... with a single GPU. 
@_date: 2013-04-16 19:09:41
I totally agree with the OP, but about daytrading what I learnt was:
I know I don't want to be a day trader because I'm a fuckin lousy daytrader and I make very very bad day trades... or trades in general... let's change that to: I don't want to be any kind of trader.
Before getting into the bitcoin market I was contemplating doing forex trades, now I'm glad I didn't. 
Oh, and btw, I made money out bitcoin, that's cause I was mining back in 2011... and I haven't sold all my coins in 2011 :) Of course, IF I was some kind of prophet and I would have kept all my mined coins till last week, AND if I would have kept mining from 2011 until now... AND I wouldn't do any trading or daytrading... THEN I would be fuckin rich.

I use bfgminer too, here's my bfgminer.cfg
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:51:48
you can easily make a 10%-20% profit DAILY due to the high volatility... the problem is you can easily loose the same amount of cash. And the problem is that unless you have a 6th sense for "feeling" the market you're toast... and even you have that 6th sense you still can be toast... because maybe mtgox crashes or something :)
So yeah, bitcoin has tons of potential for daytrading, you can earn more than you could on a forex market even with the leverage forex traders get,  but dealing here is pretty wild.
@_date: 2013-04-21 07:50:46
I hope you are right, but I'm afraid the spartans won't let it go under 100$. I'm currently waiting with buy orders at 108 and 103... 
@_date: 2013-04-16 17:05:38
same here... bought at 51 and sold at 61... after canceling my original sell order for 65... I'm either one of the worst traders in history or I can influence the price of bitcoin.
If the second is true, as long as I don't own any bitcoins ever in my life bitcoin will rise into millions... but as soon as I buy bitcoins the price crashes (yesterday I bought 6 bitcoins, luckily form me I immediately used them to pay for a Nexus 10, probably my special "bitcoin karma" didn't get this memo therefore the price crashed).
So if you want bitcoin to be successful you'll have to buy me out of bitcoins (it's gonna be hard because I have 2 rigs pushing out 820 Mhashes, so you'll obviously have to buy those, and I actually like bitcoins, so it's not gonna be a cheap deal... but hey, looks at the potential gains. 
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:22:09
You are doing something wrong, my 7870 does 400 Mhps @ 1100 Mhz and 455 Mhps @ 1220 Mhz (Memory downclocked to 750 Mhz, bfgminer: intesity 10, worksize 256).
On topic: 7970 can indeed do more than 600 Mhsps according to this chart:  . But the difference from the maximum recorded result is only a bit higher (~10%). Try playing with miner flags, try overclocking it more... but if nothing works... 600 Mh/s sounds good to me.
@_date: 2013-04-17 19:40:01
This is why (I'm trying to) I don't do daytrades anymore. My overclocked cards are mining my coin, I have some $ in my mtgox account so I only have to check the price a few times a day. If it's too low I buy, if it's too high I sell... but if it's business as usual I just keep my coins and my dollars.
@_date: 2013-04-11 15:41:15
Of course we are still mining, and 0.076 btc/day sounds sweet i get 0.05-0.06 from my two cards: 5850 @ 360 mhash and 7870 mhash.

Though question, I believe that IF they ship your unit within a year (and honestly I don't really expect them to do it any faster if you just ordered it) then you will break even but it's gonna be a relatively slow process (a few months).
I don't believe in the statements "hur durr, dificulty will be a gazillion times higher in a year and you won't make shit with your 5 ghash ASIC". 
Many people compare the transition from GPUs to ASICs to the transition from CPU mining to GPU mining, and I think they are right, but what do you know... a GPU from 2011 (when GPU mining was mainstream) is still making money in 2013, actually it's making MORE USD than it was making in 2011 (a lot less bitcoins though).
Right now ASICs are anything but mainstream, most people still mine with GPUs, and GPU mining is still profitable. 
@_date: 2013-04-14 06:10:26
"Assuming that butterfly labs comes through, and floods the market with their ASICs".
Yes if THAT happens GPU mining will be worthless, people will be selling cheap 5850s and 7870s and other cool cards :D. But that won't happen very soon and let me explain why:
- BFL wasn't able to produce a single chip so far, and things are not looking good.
- Even if they eventually make those things work it's unlikely they will flood the market. They will be slowly dripping in ASICs into the market. 
But yeah, if by some kind of miracle BFL would be able to come out tomorrow with an unlimited number of ASIC miners, GPU mining will be screwed. But it is highly unlikely that this will happen in the next few months... and beyond that point nobody can make bitcoin predictions.

No no no... you're doing it backwards.
OCing the memory doesn't help mining, and you should go a lot more aggressively on GPU clock. I'm pretty sure you can do at least 950 Mhz.
Use MSI Afterburner with unoficial overclocking enabled to OC your card:

About an hour or so ago my sell order (at the last price displayed 141.3201 if I remember correctly) got executed and I sold all my 5 bitcoins... The price displayed by mtgox got stuck there.... and now when eventually prices started to move (136.00 last time I checked) mtgox went down again... 
I guess I was lucky I was able to sell my bitcoins at one of the best prices of the day... Now I can sit back and wait for the panic sales.

I have a 5850 running 24/7... I started mining 2011 but I stopped mining for almost a year... overall I think I mined for about 6 months... 24/7 with temperatures between 75-85 C. No problems so far... In this timeframe IF i would have been smart and kept all my coins I would be having around 10.000$... unfortunately I didn't I kept selling, so far I cashed out ~300$ back in 2011 and I now have 4.5 btc... witch worth somewhere between 500 and 1200$ :D

Not necessarily, right now bitcoin is NOT a virtual currency but rather an investment. Who in their right mind would pay with bitcoins for a burger if they knew that the price of the bitcoin would go up by 20% in the next few days. Paying with paypall ? yeah why not... 
For this reason I believe that comparing bitcoins to paypall is a wrong starting point. I really have no idea what will happen to bitcoin, but I'm pretty sure that it will have totally different path from paypall.
P.S: And no, bitcoin is not "ridiculously cheap". I was here when it was 8$, 30$, 4$,  100$... now it's over 190... it is fuckin' expensive.
@_date: 2013-04-09 08:44:05
No it's not actually possible to "rinse and repeat"... Or actually it is but it's very very difficult.
It's easy to "buy low and sell high" once... but the overall tendency of bitcoin is "rise rise rise"... so after you "sell high" once... it continues rising and you can't really buy low again...

This is rubbish... I waited for the end of that DDoS and I was able to log in right when it reopened.... I quickly canceled my buy orders at 108 and lowered them to 103 and lower (down to 88).
And then I waited... I was confident this time I'm gonna profit. But the price only dropped to 110 (so even my initial buy order at 108 was too optimistic)... Imagine how disapointed the DDoSer was, I bet he set up buy orders even lower in hopes that he's gonna be able to profit big time. DDoSing the shit out of mtgox for a 15$ price drop doesn't seem to worth the trouble... there is usually a 10-20$ price swing without any DDoS.

First of all... what about btc-e ? I know they have a minimum of 500 EUR if you want to wire the money trough a bank but they do accept OKpay.... I couldn't figure out how to get money into OKpay but I guess it works... somewhere... somehow...
But the truth is the waiting time to get money in or out of a market sucks... I'm still trying to find a way to buy btc on btc-e (or any other market) transfer btc to mtgox sell it, withdraw funds to btc-e account buy bitcoin, sell on mtgox, repeat until filthy rich...  So far my only solution would be to have a huge (I do mean) huge "buffer" of FIAT in the btc-e account so that you could keep the business going while you're waiting those "up to six weeks" that mtgox says it takes to transfer your EUR into bank.

This guy is right ! Sell  your current nvidia GPU and buy something from ATI, my best bet right would be an ATI HD 7790, it only sucks 85W and averages around 300 Mhash and you can get probably around 150$. 
Mining with nvidia is simply not worth it... stop that. Sell that nvidia and buy a 7790 (or better yet scout the SH market for things like 5850, 7870, and other good mining cards).

Very interesting post, just like the last one.
I'm the most influential person in the bitcoin market. I can influence the price anyway I want. If I buy bitcoins price crashes, if I sell bitcoins the price skyrockets.
Although I'm pretty sure I can never win on trading, this fact doesn't stop me from trading. Yesterday I saw this: high prices + low volumes + mtgox DDoSed + bitcoin24 and bitfloor closed... Everything told me that the price is gonna crash... I sold my bitcoins at 92.6$... and probably this was the point where I reversed everything. Even though the market should have crashed from 92, it didn't and the price kept rising... I'm pretty sure it will keep rising until I decide to buy some coins.
TL;DR: Your analysis is correct but you just made a mistake. Unless I buy some coins prices will continue to rise.
@_date: 2013-11-25 15:01:28
I would only advise you to do that if you have an easy and reliable way to get fiat into an exchange. In my case I have a 25 EUR transfer fee, and it usually takes a week or so to get the fiat into an exchange), so when I bought my nexus10 I spent some bitcoins (~100$ at that time), coins that I never purchased back... now I own a Nexus 10 worth around 4800$ (because I payed 6 bitcoins for it). 
A friend of mine bought a nexus5 for 2 bitcoins... again, a pretty expensive phone.

From 125$ to 110$ is a normal variation in the bitcoin world. You don't need a massive DDoS for that. I was very disapointed with the results of the DDoS, I put buy order at 108$ :(.
P.S: No, I'm not the one who initiated the DDoS.
P.S.2: Don't feel sorry for the DDoSer, I don't believe that anybody was renting botnets for the DDoS, the type of people who initiate this kind of attack don't pay for anything, they probably haven't lost anything, but they might have not gained anything either...

It is indeed very risky. 
The problem is that once you bought "low" you have no way of knowing that it won't go lower and once you sold "high" there is no way to know it won't go higher.
To continue your example there are two scenarios in witch you could loose:
1. you buy at 101 and sell at 119... great, you just made ~18$/coin... and then you see the price keep climbing... 120, 125, 140... no you are trying to get on the train again and you buy at 140... you sell at 150... you have more $ apparently, but less thann you would have if you didn't sell at 119. Overall not a very good deal (even though it might seem you made two good deals).
2. You buy at 101, price keeps going down... you panic sell at 90$... you just lost 10$/coin... or you don't panic sell at 90$ and price keeps crashing... and then you come to reddit and start speaking nonsense in the bitcoin subreddit :)

Also I'm not certain about your speed: is it 1350 MH (one thousand three hundred fifty) or 1.350 (one point three fifty) ?
Both of them seem kinda unlikely, though 1350 seems a lot more appropriate than 1.350.

Let's take a look at the current ASIC market:
- BFL hasn't shipped anything yet and they have thousands of orders already.
- Avalon managed to ship 300 units, there's another batch of 600 units in production, and you can sign up for the next batch of 600 units. In a year they will probably ship under 1200 units. 
I don't think BFL has a lot higher capacity of making ASICSs, therefore even if BFL starts sending out units tomorrow, your order won't be processed for at least a year.
In a year we have no ideea where bitcoin prices and mining dificulties will be. 25 Gh/s might give you the equivalent of 1 Gh today.
If I where you I would buy a traditional mining rig (or more) (basically computer parts - make sure to buy used parts in order to minimize initial investment). 1500$ could get you probably around 2 Ghs worth of equipment (look for 5850, 7870, stuff like that) and start mining now. 
In a year you would make probably around 25-30 btc (rough estimation, could be more, could be less, depending on difficulty). At today's price that's ~4.500$. And if after a year the difficulty gets so high that your mining rigs are worthless for mining you could sell the parts for probably more than half of what you paid for them... but if that happens those 25 btc will be pretty damn precious... 
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:38:08
zero like total zero ? or "zeroish" (some would consider ~5$ zero after they saw 240$ for one bitcoin).
Total zero is almost impossible, even if they outlaw it worldwide some people would still use it (just as they use pirated torrents though they are illegal everywhere).
Zero-ish prices could be caused by a lot of factors:
- mtgox hack (*cough* 2011 *cough*)
- US bans bitcoins (unlikely, but could happen)
- zombies
- the internet collapses...
- people loose interest in cryptocurencies
- aliens
- basically anything you want to name could send bitcoins to "zeroish" prices... or it could send it into the thousands...

Ransom, bribe, hitman orders, basically anything where anonymity is highly valued. This the reason I belive bitcoins will have a great future.
If bitcoins manage to replace at least 50% of all criminal transactions, it has to be worth at least 1000$/btc.

Actually the high volatility of btc can be exploited in order to make additional interest... Ex: if you would have sold 100 bitcoins at 260 and bought them back 70$ you would make one hell of ROI, and that's only in a week, in 30 days you can easily do more than 5%.
The problem is that you can also lose a freaking lot, and unless the network is operated by somebody who has a freakin' time machine, there's no way to guarantee anything.

THIS IS FUCKING CENSORSHIP ON MOTHERFUCKIN REDDIT ! 
Seriously, this is BAD BAD BAD! This subreddit was already highly "censored" by its users, they would religiously downvote into oblivion bad news, anything that has to do with litecoin, and "upvote for visibility" every small business that started accepting bitcoins and positive posts like "I bought at 2000$ but I feel blessed". Reading the frontpage was like reading a newspaper in the communist era, "Our industry just completed it's 5 year goals in just under 3 months, the supreme leader makes a speach in front of the hard working crowd, capitalism is failing". For fucks sake, even the trollbox was a more trustworthy source of information than front page. 
Look, I like bitcoins, but one of the reasons I like bitcoin is because it's free and unregulated, everything this subreddit isn't. If you really believe in bitcoin you should stop this madness. Yes, there will be a bunch of "OMFG IS CRASHING, SELL NOW ELSE LOSE EVERYTHING" posts along with "TO THE MOON" posts, but I don't mind those... regulating a place that is by default unregulated (reddit) when talking about an unregulated currency seems idiotic on the other hand.
TO THE MOON !

I started bitcoining (mining and trading) almost 2 years ago, in may 2011. I bought an ATI 5850 card with a decent 360 Mhash output and I used it for mining in 2011 (I was also constantly uploading my bitcoins to mtgox and ocasionaly doing trades...) I always tried to keep my money "split" between dolars and bitcoins... when the market crashed in 2011 I cashed out my dolars (about 350$) and stoped mining (bad bad idea - but at that time there was no point in it).
After almost a year of not mining, I restarted mining when bitcoin was around 7$... and also done a few trades (most of them where stupid, I am a bad trader... though I made profit on some deals I suspect I only broke even or something, I might have possibly lost a little bit in overall trading)... Today I "cashed out" again at the sensible price of 141.320 (yes, that one)... with about 750$... and left one bitcoin (actually I transfered it to mtgox but it's still not showing up). 
TL;DR: 
Even after my initial investment (a 5850 bought second hand) and power consumption (estimation, since I always have my computer on anyways, and was using the computer while mining, don't have a dedicated mining rig) I still made about 1000$ in about a year of mining and trading.
Not bad... but today I calculated the amount of cash I would have if I never sold a single bitcoin... just acumulate all the bitcoins and sell them today at 141.320... Well I would have made an extra 4.500$... So considering the amount of work involved in daytrading, and the risks involved, I wouldn't bother about day trading (though I must admit I am glad I sold at above 140$ and I will be buying when I will feel the prices are really down).

well there's btc-e.com but the minimum bank deposit is 500 eur (after you have the money in the exchange you can buy smaller fractions). 
Another option is mtgox but the price on MtGox is usually about 50 euros higher than on btc-e (actually it's the most expensive echange out there).

bitcoin is pretty much like cash: anonymous, uninsured, and transactions are irreversible.
One of the things we love about cold hard cash (that also applies to bitcoin) is that there's no way a recurring subscription that you might not even want or use anymore would seamlessly take money out of your pocket or maybe it would take money that you don't even have (in case of a credit card). No, your cash stays in your wallet until you willingly pay for something (or you get robbed or something). That's the way it should be with bitcoins. 
It also needs to stay this way. There was a lot of hype about fancy pornsites accepting bitcoins. I'm not the type who would pay for porn, I want my porn free thank you very much. But in case I would have some fetish that only a paid website would satisfy I would never-ever give out my credit card, because I would be afraid that somewhere inte process of pressing "next, next, next" in order I would sign up for some bullshit service that I would be billed for monthly and it would take a lot of effort to get rid of it. There's no such danger in cash... or bitcoin... So yeah this is actually a good thing.

what are you mining with ?

No, it doesn't matter if the bitcoin price skyrockets to 10.000$/btc, it's still a risky business. That's unless he bought those cards directly with usd (but as far as I know most mining hardware is sold for btc). 
Let's say he bought those cards for 0.18 btc each @ btc price of 140$/usd 
* At the current difficulty increase (~80% monthly increase) he will get 0.04 btc for the first month, 0.02 btc second month, 0.01 for the following two months and then he will start making less than 0.01 btc/month. (
* Let's be very optimistic here and asume an average of 0.005 for the following 12 months, and 0.0025 btc average for the second year.
* This means that after 2 years and 4 months (of non-stop problem-free mining, with free electricity) he will have 0.08 btc (made in the first 6 months) + 0.06 btc in the following 12 months + 0.03. This adds up to 0.17 btc.... less than he payed 28 months ago. If the dificulty doesn't drop after 28 months he will break even in ~3 years... IF he has access to free electricity, IF his mining hardware doesn't break or malfunctions in these 3 years, and IF the monthly difficulty increase will slow down.

If bitcoin is 10.000$... I'll would have 34.000$ (assuming I don't "panic sell it" at 5000$.... or 1000$... or hell..even at 500$). So... no lambo for me.

yeah, and they would have been filled at btc-e too, but I don't have any money on those exchanges (it's not like I have tons of money on gox either :) ).
