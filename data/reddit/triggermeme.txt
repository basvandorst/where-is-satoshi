What does it have to do with Satoshi? Something about his account being compromised?
@_date: 2014-03-06 19:13:21
I would imagine a guy like him would have it very well hidden and encrypted

Can someone explain to me what is happening? I've been detached from bitcoin for months
@_date: 2016-07-10 02:34:03
Can you please explain to someone who has been in the sidelines:
* Why does half the reward make people anticipate a rise in price?
* Why would the next 4 years be any different?
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:15:07
There'll always be earlier adopters than you. There will always be winners and losers in every trade. Don't fret

I was considering purchasing a miner with the bitcoin I have left. Don't think the few coins I have will matter much even if the price climbs
@_date: 2013-02-22 14:21:05
Do you think the banks would ever allow that?
I would presume they'd come up with their own e-currency (and have it backed by government) before they bow to bitcoin.

They have a [black friday deal]( but people have seem to lost all faith in the company

I am kicking myself since I had more than $1000 invested back when it was worth 5BTC=1USD. (Long story short, money was in companies lost and not in my wallet)
The thing I am worried. In the markets, people tend to buy high and sell low, mostly because they follow the trend and usually by the time they see a trend its on the late side. I wonder if I should hold off on investing in BTC again... Last time BTC climbed to +$30/BTC, it dropped back down...

Are you in Ottawa? If so I would recommend a place where you can show up with cash and they will deposit the amount to your wallet.

Rule of Bitcoin that people seem to forget:
**Trust no one!**
If it's not in your wallet, it's in someone else's wallet

What, according to you, would not be considered early to you anymore?
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:20:52
I am not advocating that the 'system' is any better. But see my continued comment below. With an inflationary system there is no desire to hoard, and people entering the market do not enter at a loss. In a deflationary environment the early savers are at an advantage. Either extreme is problematic, which is why the original idea of the fed was created. (at least from an idealistic point of view)
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:41:33
Notice how elsewhere in there pages they estimate about 2 months delivery...
@_date: 2013-05-10 13:54:13
In the following wallet: (Mine)
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:11:16
So 111,111 bitcoins in the first wallet... so approx $86 Million. 
Am I the only one that thinks this is ridiculous? 
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:34:35
I am considering the pre-purchase of their Monarch BPU 600 C. I haven't been a miner in years (I was back in the GPU mining days). Could someone please clarify the following questions?
* Theoretically, if they deliver a year from now, and let's say the bitcoin prices drop or just remain constant then. Will there be any possibility for profitability with the increasing exponential difficulty? It seems to me the only reason why mining is profitable now is the bitcoin price increase.
* The last pre-sale butterflylabs had - How much later did their products end up being shipped? (I requested a refund when they didn't deliver months later, so I lost track)
@_date: 2013-03-22 16:00:11
Please explain the correlation?
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:55:43
People tend to get the market wrong. They historically buy high and sell low... even when they know they shouldn't
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:29:35
Yes they were quick to do it within a few days. Are you considering to do the same?
@_date: 2013-06-11 15:17:13
This is actually a big deal
@_date: 2013-11-27 03:34:07
While you're on the topic... any service that you feel is missing with bitcoin? :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 19:17:16
Which is scary to think. 
Seems like bitcoin can crash in the hands of a few rich bitcoiners if they decided to sell...
I wonder mathematically how much the price would drop if he did decide to sell as much as he could...
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:44:46
1 year is very a long time. I know butterflylabs got a pretty bad reputation a while ago for being late, but didn't realize it got tarnished this bad.
What about their old bitforce hardware, which they guarantee delivery by Christmas? What's the best mining hardware to buy today?
@_date: 2013-02-22 16:27:39
Well do you think anything not backed by government can ever go mainstream?
@_date: 2013-02-01 21:22:23
I think it was [these guys](
@_date: 2013-11-27 01:35:41
Yes it is. 
Can you tell me how late they were in their last delivery? (I got a refund last time when they were behind a few months)
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:17:34
Go... go, on....
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:21:47
I was thinking the same thing. But I guess there is the element of 'government backing'... Forcing everyone to use fiat currency kind of solves this problem since everyone generally starts using the currency around the same time, and there aren't many with a clear advantage.
Maybe the larger topic here is more of an economics issue. Inflation vs Deflation. Does a currency that is largely deflationary (as well as driven by adoption) make sense for new adopters in the future, if they've missed out along the way?
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:19:05
I'm thinking the same thing, after seeing three bubbles. But if you look at the bitcoin graph for all data on a log scale you will also notice it very linear. Even with the bubbles the overall rate of valuation has been steady. So steady it's quite scary
@_date: 2013-03-05 14:31:35
I had lost all of my investments i put into bitcoin back when it was $5... damn GLBSE
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:13:51
[Aaaaand it's gone](
@_date: 2013-11-27 19:52:58
Yeah I've noticed they go down with very heavy traffic... maybe a sign of a high being approached? :)
Edit: Yup, seems like they price is dropping
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:49:15
"Wait... so he gave you just 2 bitcoin?" - Said every non-bitcoiner
@_date: 2013-02-01 23:40:37
Well, it was a combination of GLBSE, BTCSYN (which had their own theft), and Clipse's mining pool... I guess everyone of them failed. I likely had $500 in cash... and another $600 in mining hardware that was generating coin (that was then invested). So yeah... hoarding would have been waaaaay better.
@_date: 2013-11-27 13:58:45
For the lazy... the [log graph](
@_date: 2013-02-01 22:17:05
No. I asked for a refund before recieving it. Though u'm pretty sure i was early in the list. Just got impatient, probably shouldn't have. Are they out yet?
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:04:29
The fact that bitcoin heavily benefits early adopters. 
How does this play out as a long term viable currency? 
Hypothetical: As a new potential adopter in the future, why would I want to participate in a system where the people that started years ago got rich? Seems like I would always be poor in comparison, in a system where I would be supporting the very people that got rich from having started mining with CPUs long ago.
@_date: 2013-03-22 15:51:12
The question remains: What does the continuation of this pattern look like?
