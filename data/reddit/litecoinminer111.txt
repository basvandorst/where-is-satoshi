Fuck Amtrak. I had two business class tickets from old Town San Diego to oc when I was 16. It was raining and an hour late. Finally, another Amtrak comes, which is naturally empty.... So I get on it and the car is a ghost Town.
The guy who collects tickets, rather than apologize about how we've been in the rain for an hour and explain what happened to our actual train, decides to make some rude remarks about how were lucky it's not busy or he would have kicked us off. the cars aren't even numbered so how would I know it wasn't the right one? the guy was seriously a dick.
MAYBE it would be if you treated your customers nicely. Been 6 years and haven't gone back. Plus they raised prices and it's cheaper and faster to drive

Uh.... no. 1000 euro is like 12000 euro a year after tax... and if you're making less than that you're making way more on welfare and you probably have a free apartment. 
Bank fees are high as fuck. I only got paid once a month instead of every two weeks because my employer didn't want to pay them. Its the norm.

Or that the Obama Admin keeps US colonies from becoming citizens due to a hundred y/o supreme court decisions that reasons Samoan's and Filipino's and the like as "savages of alien race" that "cannot assimilate to anglo saxon principles".
Who is the real racist?

I'm an American but I've lived and worked in Germany. 
If you're American, you'll be used to being paid every other Friday afternoon. In Germany, most (if not all) companies pay once a month due to high bank fees. 
Bank fees in general are extremely high. Many "debit" cards attached to checking accts. will charge huge fees (up to 50 euros a month) if you put less than 500E a month in direct deposit. 
I'm sure you can see why this is annoying and hard for those less disciplined looking at a huge ass paycheck.

Well I'm pretty sure that's what I was inferring considering the President can't just create his/her own legislation [without having it voted on by Congress].

this has been going on for over a decade. I read about gov credit card fraud across departments in a book so long ago I forgot what it was called.

Just because he's anti anything doesn't mean he'd legislate against it on A federal level.
