Those thing it isn't just about BTC but everything else, when something go well, is the best thing, when the same thing go bad is the shittiest thing in the world...
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:34:49
I bought some but I'm looking for lower price
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:33:56
Depends on latitude and season, no?
@_date: 2018-01-12 13:36:41
Right now ledger nano s isn't available, buy trezor 
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:46:19
Happy for you! :(
Italy is so back
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:37:37
Actually it's backed by people getting up for work tomorrow.

He only needs to be right about his investments.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:43:47
You have done the best choice!
I also finally bought my ledger, it's really easy and comfortable you can carry you coin with you without problems!
@_date: 2018-01-22 18:26:08
The best and safest place to store your alts....
@_date: 2018-01-24 18:03:16
I think you're doing something wrong.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:05:55
We know it my friend....
@_date: 2018-01-18 15:08:59
For now... but if BTC won't resolve the high fees problem and slow transaction it'll be surpassed
@_date: 2018-01-03 14:12:06
I'll try, thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-19 13:33:29
And in my school there is my professor which don't know what is a Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-26 14:56:43
I don't think the bitcoin symbol is copyrighted but i could be wrong.
A quick google search for free bitcoin logos shows plenty, this could be worth a look: 
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:25:34
The most secure place to buy Ledger nano is on their own website, don't buy on ebay or something like this because the most are scam. The only way is to buy another hardwallet like trezor or wait on 22 march for leder nano
@_date: 2018-01-03 12:15:07
this is one of my favorite scenes. It is an inside joke I use amongst my friends at work when we are in a boring or stupid meeting. I didn't think to apply it to bitcoin. Good catch OP.
My two other favorite quote from ghostbusters can apply to bitcoin too: "When someone asks if you are a God, say yes."
@_date: 2018-01-02 15:54:07
its like crossfit
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:03:05
Planning to hold my coins at least another 5-6 years :)
@_date: 2018-01-02 16:28:38
Finally, I am so happy
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:22:28
LOL wat?
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:54
Banks with cryptos??
This don't sounds good
@_date: 2018-01-08 19:31:07
I know which these problems are temporary, I hope they'll "fix" it asap.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:35:16
Hhahaha this is perfect releted
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:36:22
Just came here to say that Bitcoin technology didn't change. Don't panic.
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:32:49
Yes but you can try to invest in ETH also is a low risk investment
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:29:54
If this app will work also for ledger it'll be perfect!
@_date: 2018-01-18 19:45:12
Thanks for the answers
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:31:25
The perfect Gif.
@_date: 2018-01-16 13:29:25
Sadly the BTC is falling down not for price but for extremly high fees and slow transactions, if they don't do something other coins will overtake BTC
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:55:03
The king knows the way ;)
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:08:13
Ledger is a really good project, hope they will add as much coin as possible.
@_date: 2018-01-16 15:17:12
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:12:49
They do almost the same thing, same security but Ledger can support more coins.
Trezor coin supported: 
Ledger coin supported: 
@_date: 2018-01-15 14:33:39
I'm happy for you dude!
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:22:49
I'm hoping whihc the BTC will update his blockchain for more fast transaction and lower fees...
@_date: 2018-01-30 16:45:23
Thanks dude!
@_date: 2018-01-15 17:32:37
It's not a debt clock. It shows the time.
@_date: 2018-01-05 14:56:19
You guys are funny
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:49:22
Maybe yes but It can helps you to understand the price is the same time.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:52:12
Is never too late my friend, also there are a lot of crypto like ARK,XLM, EOS, ETH with really huge potential.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:28:43
Do you do daily transaction with your ledger?
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:46:08
Now, the people are just looking to do some profit with BTC because it can't be used anymore as a currency due to fees and slow transactions.
I remember some years ago the fees were low and pretty good speed, good times ;(
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:37:08
Why do you carry it with you??
Can't you leave it in a safe box or something like it?
@_date: 2018-01-26 16:44:26
Ledger is the best and secure right now
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:14:09
You can't buy a ledger nano s until 22th march because it's out of stock, you should try Trezor.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:17:43
Yes but personally I prefer buy those things only in the official websites.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:27:32
Different times. All these stupid 'back then it was good, now it's bad' posts are getting annoying. Marketcap needs to grow. Just like an economy needs to keep growing.
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:20:55
How can you get phised in ladeger nano? o_O
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:39:29
Ok, good luck with your developments! :)
@_date: 2018-01-16 17:57:33
Sure, those coin will reach an incredible price in 5 years!!
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:57:35
With all this information I'm going to pretend to be you and take that $40,000
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:36:40
Is it available for iOS?
@_date: 2018-01-18 17:31:57
We will see...
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:05:38
EOS isn't speculative....
@_date: 2018-01-25 18:50:34
LOL, 1$ cafe, 5$ fees :D
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:31:19
ATM bitcoin.... when we will see something like this in Italy?? D:
@_date: 2018-01-22 05:23:30
Yes it's possibile but I also bought from second vendor and I did the reset, now everything is working well
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:31:01
It's matter of time, everything will be normal soon
@_date: 2018-01-27 10:30:08
This makes me happy because I am a pole vaulter
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:52:51
Guys BTC will hit 1Million dollar tomorrow, HOLD HOLD!!
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:38:48
No bro, why EOS should be used for pump and dump?
@_date: 2018-01-10 15:27:48
The bcash folks are not going to be happy about this.
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:30:44
Yes but at least read some news about it and try to understand how to price will go
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:27:59
I still have 500e missing since 11 july. Had only 1 human reply on my ticket so far.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:24:10
Keep calm everything is fine, I think this is made for save some money on fees
@_date: 2018-01-17 17:46:24
10k$ is better than 15k-20k$ no??
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:04:59
Could you expain why??
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:08:08
Invest in crypto is never a safe investment, anyway if you want to make some buck with BTC you'll have to invest a lot of money
@_date: 2018-01-26 15:00:54
Nah, the logo shouldn't be a problem
@_date: 2018-01-29 13:37:33
I'm happy to see those 16 years old making apps like this, congrats!
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:36:32
I'm a gamer and a crypto invester but I also hate it
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:32:33
Keep them in a safe place like strong box.
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:35:25
I prefer this: 
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:44:14
Thank you all
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:34:05
All crypto market is bleeding,hold your coin and wait till everything will return normal.
@_date: 2018-01-30 17:25:00
wait, that is a charity??? ummm sounds kinda like money laundering. how much are the employees of this "charity" paid? is there any relationship between the pineapple people and the free software foundation???
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:36:22
I have ledger in my own safety box.
@_date: 2018-01-12 16:16:16
It dependes all by developer, they need to make the blockchain work faster and the fees more low only if those problems will be resolved the BTC will rise.
Right now we can't use BTC as daily payment due those issue and coin like ARK, XLM, EOS, ETH will overtake him
@_date: 2018-01-11 16:13:37
The BTC is falling down :\
I think some other coin will overtake BTC
@_date: 2018-01-26 18:14:44
Yep, the weiss rating is pretty bad.
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:01:39
This guys is right, if you have 1 pc in the house and you would use as hardware wallet is really easy and safe.
@_date: 2018-01-19 14:56:58
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:30:26
I don't think it mate....
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:39:17

@_date: 2018-01-03 11:50:49
I'm interested in running a lightning nodes but concerned about security. I'd love to see some resources/guides on that side of things.
@_date: 2018-01-18 18:40:09
I also use ledger but I deposit in it only high amounts of crypto, some small amount I have it on my desktop wallet or exchange for daily trade
@_date: 2018-01-19 15:55:01
Why not, but android is the most pentested device it isn't secure if you have an iOS is better.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:43:44
I was ordering my lambo, but saw the BTC price. Changed idea.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:31:08
Why you should put your ledger with a lot of money in a pocket??
@_date: 2018-01-31 16:58:03
I caught it at $11,1111.
@_date: 2018-01-16 16:47:47
"What a shitty life"
@_date: 2018-01-15 16:23:47
You have some chance to get back you EOS, there are a lot of guys over reddit which helps guys like you
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:47:24
Really interesting :)
@_date: 2018-01-12 14:21:09
Why would you sell your bitcoin for Chicken
@_date: 2018-01-31 18:09:56
How can I buy EOS on the official site?
@_date: 2018-01-11 15:06:07
1) Don't buy a leder nano if you investement is low
2) Don't buy BTC, just buy other coins like ETH, ARK, XLM, EOS or other coins which you like
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:29:16
Those was the best times :,)
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:33:09
I'm pretty sure the paper money will be deleted by the government and crypto will replace it
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:22:49
Send a ticket to binance if they won't respond make a thread here and they'll surely helps you out
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:00:01
And you can see it on road map.
@_date: 2018-01-26 05:40:24
Yes, I saw the BTC fees are stabling
@_date: 2018-01-04 15:32:34
In &lt;random country&gt; every second news article is about bitcoin!=money But they added it to the "money" banner on the finance page of the major search page a month ago.
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:37:33
Congrats, you bought it at really good price, now hold hold hold!
@_date: 2018-01-19 17:07:01
For BTC I'm using this: 
Really good and easy to use wallet
@_date: 2018-01-10 14:51:44
Future is here, bye bye Bcash
@_date: 2018-01-25 10:18:45
Those rules are the basic of a crypto trader, I don't think any good trade need to see this video.
@_date: 2018-01-11 18:23:11
Pretty sure they'll do another hard-fork soon...
@_date: 2018-01-25 12:39:07
If they resolve all the scalable problems, BTc surely hit 1m$
@_date: 2018-01-27 11:13:42
@_date: 2018-01-17 16:33:47
Outsider here, why are you in a position where you have no more real money to invest? Sounds precarious to me given the volatility.
@_date: 2018-01-19 12:30:39
This kills the btrash.
@_date: 2017-12-22 10:51:56
Right now it's back to $14,588.

Me too but some guys are in only for them
@_date: 2018-05-23 07:07:20
Surely with a safe coin like ETH, BTC or XMR and after doing some research on coins like XLM, ARK, EOS and see what you like more
@_date: 2018-05-21 12:22:57
Exactly, those bastards did it with success.....

@_date: 2018-05-14 13:05:33
You could try LUNO

Ok mate, upvoted :)

@_date: 2018-06-07 10:50:18
@_date: 2018-06-08 05:18:05
I invested a lot in EOS, but bro, make always your own research.
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:53:29
Exactly, are feeless
@_date: 2018-06-07 06:24:14
Only EOS need to register, for XLM if you'd like to receive 2% annually of inflation you need to do some steps but isn't a registration.
@_date: 2018-06-07 16:41:49
EOS team leader (Dan Larimer) has already 2 successful projects running, the EOS development team seems really great and the EOS launch is the next days, I don't think it's a scam.

@_date: 2018-03-02 19:33:07
I'm hatching yall!
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:12:57
Surely Ledger nano.
You can hold also other coins in it :)
@_date: 2018-03-09 14:47:45
Never ever ever share your private keys. If you must, just make a new wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-01 13:57:29
Amazing. More volatile than Bitcoin lol
@_date: 2018-03-15 20:32:25
And is the most secure way to hold your cryptos ;)
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:49:59
No mate, I also don't like Bitcoin cash but I'd like to know from the other guy why he think which BHC is the best coin....
@_date: 2018-03-13 05:56:53
EOS'll be launched soon.
@_date: 2018-03-22 12:46:24
@_date: 2018-03-09 13:46:34
Ledger and trezor have same security level and the price is pretty near but Ledger support more coins, so I would go for it.
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:37:16

@_date: 2018-02-05 18:03:47
No, but if you're planning to hold your coins for long term is adviced to buy it or if you have a lot of money invest in.
@_date: 2018-03-09 15:48:30
It won't be forever, BTC will be ovetook....
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:10:03
How could you chose Trezor??
@_date: 2018-03-13 15:35:01
It'll surely recover after that thing....
@_date: 2018-02-28 15:07:03

I suggest ledger because the security level is the same but Ledger can support more coins.
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:03:23

Kinda ironic...blockchain would make the government more transparent (assuming the government adopts it) and would thus make it more difficult for them to carry out their corrupt acts
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:47:55
I laso don't think this, taht's why I'd like to know the reasons.
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:48:03
Ledger nano s and trezer have the same functions but Ledger can support more coins than Trezor.

Does anyone know how profitable it would be to buy up a bunch of gpus and sell them a few months later thoughts??
@_date: 2018-03-02 15:31:16
How can this coin be the best? :D

A lot of people are building on EOS and when it'll be released I think everyone will build on it.
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:55:09
And put it in a safebox of in bank.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:42:27

I laughed out so hard. This is exactly a different (positive) perspective to accept 7k.
@_date: 2018-02-19 20:05:13
I would suggest to use this amazing web wallet:  , really easy to use and pretty safe.
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:06:09

@_date: 2018-02-06 15:40:51
I hope you are at least getting paid to post stupid things.

@_date: 2018-03-12 07:55:59
Surely the fact of Brock Pierce will ruin the EOS image but if the project is working we can't say anthing....
I think whihc this it's this an excuse because their are afraid to the potential of EOS....
@_date: 2018-02-09 09:26:30
Is your measure of success of bitcoin it's value?

The support of Ledger is the worst I have ever seen....
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:56:32
Just like in Game of Thrones, every king gets taken down

You're rught man but the BTC need to get a update or coins like XLM, ARK, ETH, EOS ecc... can overtake it, they want to add BTC in bar or in store but if I have to buy a cup of coffie and pay 1$+ 3-4$ fees I don't think it'll work.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:00:03
Weird that Ethereum and dozens of other successful coins violate what u say is tantamount to success
@_date: 2018-02-02 15:03:21
Yes, but only if you bought it with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:51:18
Yeah, I like it, pretty fast....
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:49:28
most of the people who ask me what it is I tell you that it's too hard to explain and I peer :D
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:01:46
why your ledger should be a fraud?
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:10:06
R.I.P for People who sold thousand of BTC at 2-3$....
@_date: 2018-02-06 13:12:19

You can buy from reseller but before to use it you'll need to reset it and generate new seeds.
@_date: 2018-02-01 17:03:36
Ah yes yes. I'm sorry bro xD
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:48:29
You're right bro, I'm buying more possible!!
@_date: 2018-02-12 11:15:51
So, basically, some people before have been wrong about stuff.
@_date: 2018-02-15 11:24:45
That is so funny, they are a lot of ignorant people xD
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:28:13

Bullshit Voorhees. You're just trying to clean up your own history by pretending to be on the right side. You were not. You did enormous damage and you caused enormous losses to newbies that believed in your and Ver's bullcrap.
@_date: 2018-02-28 14:26:22
Before to invest in a crypto always do your own research and don't ask to some random guy ;)
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:38:05
I don't think it....
@_date: 2018-03-21 17:34:38
I too dream of the day when the entire world can gain and lose thousands of dollars in a matter of hours
@_date: 2018-02-28 09:40:43
I don't think on ledger this can be definited a con.
@_date: 2018-02-14 13:19:27
Trump declared bankrupcy six times - I don't know why anyone would expect him to be good with the budget. His voter base doesn't seem to care about all the broken promises. Because wall. And her emails.

@_date: 2018-02-20 13:24:45
Get a normal payment and after you invest a part of your payment in BTC and if the BTC will crash??
@_date: 2018-02-06 15:49:52
Chairman Crapo? You can't make this shitcoin up
@_date: 2018-03-12 08:40:17
Where can I watch it?
@_date: 2018-03-06 13:11:21
Of course this is the best but for this you'll require a 100$ investment, so take it only if it's worth.
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:55:21
EOS is resisting pretty good to this crash.
@_date: 2018-02-26 07:35:19
You I know, but a lot of people don't check it....
@_date: 2018-02-14 17:02:11

@_date: 2018-02-26 12:55:59
With all those factors is really difficult to find one, you could try with Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-02-01 18:14:22
No, because he bought it with Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-01 15:36:12

Nah, for now one of the best for start it EOS...
@_date: 2018-04-09 12:18:16
That's why EOS will be one of the best coins in the next years ;)
@_date: 2018-04-10 12:46:20
If our winning depends by a site, that would be amazing.....
@_date: 2018-04-18 18:37:32
