[Plug]We are an India focused Exchange - 
We dont have our own platform but work on the LocalBitcoins platform. We are focussing more on customer advocacy - taking bitcoins mainstream - rather than building another exchange from the ground up.
Our core product is that we enable people to buy Bitcoins using PayTM ( . PayTM is like a p2p payment app in India for small value purchases ($1 to $50). We are helping very small businesses to start investing into Bitcoin by buying in very small amounts every month. These amounts could be as low as Rs 150 (~$2) and we try to handhold them so that they secure their bitcoins. 
There is a lot of FUD in India regarding bitcoins - even the central bank last week labelled it as a Ponzi scheme. Fortunately, there is a lot of curiosity in India regarding Bitcoin and we have a fairly active media so it helps in propagating different view points. 
We have seen small businesses come to us for buying $2 worth of Bitcoins, hold for a week or two and see the value going up. They get more curious and start reading up and even ask us questions. Then they start putting more money. The confidence takes time to build. Right now it is extremely hard for a non-technical person to get into Bitcoin - atleast in India. We want to be the bridge of trust where he feels confident to take the first step.
India has the potential for being the source of the next 100 million HODLers. Hopefully we do our part in getting 1 HODLer at a time.
