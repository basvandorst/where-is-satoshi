Not really. $81million is an insignificant sum in the global money system. It's too small to even be a rounding error.

You're naive or ignorant of human nature if you assume that people attracted to violence and power are all making cool, calm and rational economic decisions. The onus for proving that all people are rational actors and warlords wouldn't rule, is on you. We have plenty of examples around the world of what happens in a power vacuum and they're all basket cases. We have no examples and no indications of any basis in reality of your anarchist utopia.

FYI, you've completely misunderstood life expectancy. People didn't get to 40 and drop dead of old age, the staggeringly high child mortality rates skewed the numbers.

I'd trust the ACCC's judgement here, they have a long history of being solid advocates for consumers and preventing anti-competitive behaviour.
Yes it sucks the accounts were shutdown but I think the reality of the situation is likely more prosaic. Rather than a cartel-like collaboration/conspiracy, sometime during a regular review the banks likely saw a series of transactions to bitcoin related accounts and flagged it as an unknown risk not worth taking, be it financially or legally.
Perhaps a more thorough investigation is in order but I doubt it would find anything - there are some industries who do collude but it's nearly impossible to prove because it isn't overt and via smoke filled rooms nor via email correspondence say "lets fuck these startups".
