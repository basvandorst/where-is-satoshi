I traded up from 50€ to 3BTC when it was at 1k to feel like a genius when i cashed out before it dropped to 200€
Now i feel like an idiot

Maybe we should make a new suicide hotline for the people that sold on a low.
@_date: 2014-01-06 15:30:07
I don't want quick profit, i just want to be rich ;P
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:00:06
well i did 2000, didnt work either ^^
@_date: 2013-12-18 23:44:40
dont worry ill still bitch about when bitcoin is back to 1000$ and people on here downvote every serious discussion :)
@_date: 2013-12-16 11:33:52
I dont being being elitist. The circlejerk gets super annoying though, its at the point where any discussion is pointless.
@_date: 2013-12-21 11:44:34
ask anyone in any store accepting bitcoin right now.
@_date: 2013-12-18 18:04:45
he probably gave money to someone on the trollbox 
@_date: 2013-12-16 14:58:49
Can you get me that chart during the bubonic plague ?
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:54:59
Because i believe that it has the potential to not be play money anymore :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:30:24
when someone makes quantum computing work fully it doesnt matter how you encrypt data using todays techniques as it will just brute force them in a matter of seconds.
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:42:19
They could also just have a cheap store tablet, its really not hard to accept bitcoin payments without a fully fledged pc standing around :)
@_date: 2013-12-12 11:29:16
BTC Received through a payment service like bitpay is immediately converted to USD for the Proprietor by a rate that is only allowed to change in a fixed intervall.
Should they want to hold the coins themselves there is a risk, however the few pizzas that will be sold for BTC should not have a negative effect on the business even if it is worth 0$ tomorrow.
All in all its free publicity and extra traffic for basically nothing and in the worst case a few pizzas lost.
@_date: 2013-12-22 20:02:42


Its pretty, real time and easily readable.
@_date: 2013-12-06 08:56:15
Naturally the first thing to do when reading this is withdrawing 2000 BTC from Cryptsy, didnt work tho :D
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:12:36
Taken widely out of context though, bitcoin fell by like 20% the day before.
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:48:52
But a paper wallet is even worse, imagine people needing to work hard and join a religion just to redeem a 6$ Gift card
@_date: 2013-12-30 18:26:24
Well, someone had to go and name it bitCOIN
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:26:20
Shouldnt you have cashed out a few millions and not really care anyway :P ?
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:34:43
i honestly dont get the appeal, gifting money or gift certificates 
is terrible. (i quite like the comparison of someones grandpa with "the watchtower" as well)
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:33:28
Was gonna comment that they obviously don't allow begging in their Arena but was delighted to see everyone else feels the same way :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 13:56:01
Any crypto currency, at best its a commodity (currently at least)
@_date: 2013-11-27 09:35:54
Ok from now on when someone asks me about the cons of Bitcoins, not being able to plant a Bitcoin tree will be  
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:09:28
Well most things don't grow by the factor of a million in 4 years :)
@_date: 2013-12-14 22:44:08
Nah im just stupid, your math is spot on :) 
However, if you start at 1 cent and a bankroll of 20 BTC you are pretty much guaranteed free money for life ^^
@_date: 2013-12-06 09:12:58
I calculated that if i had 2 Million € i could buy a nice house retire and have 10k to spend freely every month.
@_date: 2013-12-14 09:32:00
I don't believe in quark as a currency just as i don't with any other Altcoin but i do believe they will make me loads of money duking out which one can secure the market.
This Thread is a great advertisment for QRK, thanks :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:27:14
YOU KNOW WHAT THEY CALL A 30% DROP IN A DAY ON THE STOCK MARKET ? is the biggest joke when it comes to crypto :)
@_date: 2013-12-03 12:13:57
While i dont want to judge altcoins and bitcoins correlation now, this picture is taken wildly out of context.
Bitcoin jumped down by 20% the day before and some altcoins didnt even care.
@_date: 2013-12-07 08:59:47
Shouldn't you be filthy rich and don't care anyway ?
@_date: 2013-12-18 20:46:13
SHH DONT INTERRUPT THE CIRCLEJERK
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:32:30
so someone that has a decent business model to exploit play money is a selfish parasite ?
@_date: 2013-12-07 12:19:15
800$ per BTC
@_date: 2013-11-26 12:43:17
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:28:03
I USED VIRVOX TOO BUT THE FEES ARE HORRENDOUS
@_date: 2013-12-18 11:01:12
Didn't even know btce had short orders lol
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:01:52
Which is the right thing to do :)
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:45:17
LIKE ANYONE WOULD NOT LIKE A SUPER NINTENDO LOL
@_date: 2013-12-26 12:43:44
Only acceptable if its 1 Bitcoin per wallet. Like anyone cares if they get 0.00X of monopoly money
@_date: 2013-11-26 13:22:36
You can tell by the amount effort going into this cosplay that he can't be me  :p
@_date: 2013-11-30 23:58:48
Well if you invested 10$ at the beginning of these 3 years you can hire a few million hookers to keep you company 
@_date: 2013-12-11 22:25:06
So you are filthy rich and you thank bitcoin by telling people that a 0% risk is too high.
@_date: 2013-12-22 19:58:16
HOW DO YOU KNOW ? DID YOU SEE HIM TALK ? 
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:30:43
They would probably take your phone though.
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:51:11
Well i calculated using 100 years from the moment i have the 2 million and including inflation. Should my lifespan unexpectedly rise to longer than 126 years I'm quite sure that i will know ahead of time and adjust :P 
@_date: 2013-12-15 14:38:46
Yes thats why you increase the opening bet in accordance to your new bankroll.
Bankroll divided by the sum of all exponents of 2 from 1 to 20
Just so you can always bet 20 times and gain a millionth of your bankroll
I just wrote a bot to execute that strategy on just-dice, any ideas to make it better :) ? 
@_date: 2013-12-06 10:52:47
I thought the LA Subway was gonna accept bitcoin for tickets, then again i dont even know if they have a subway :(
@_date: 2013-12-14 18:10:38
Your continuation of his math seems wrong :)
@_date: 2013-12-23 09:37:00
or they have a phone that displays transactions ^^
