I also had a problem with the video. Using Firefox with history turned off which also disables cookies I think. 
The $0.49 isn't worth complaining about, but I would like to watch the video. I love when Andreas goes into his no-holds-barred, Bitcoin is going to kick your ass, attitude.

This post has it backwards. Bigger blocks are needed now (&gt;2MB)! Then SegWit in X months.
There's little benefit to doing SegWit now and bigger blocks later. LN will hurt the incentive for the big blocks fork and it may never happen if done in that order, leaving Bitcoin in the hands of Blockstream and not the people. A sad end to a great innovation.

If you can understand that bias then you can exploit it and make money in the markets. At the same time you'll be pulling the price away from that bias and more towards the true value. That is the magic of prediction markets. :)
@_date: 2017-02-12 20:09:14
The original post said it. LN in 2- 3 years. Until then 2MB blocks arent going to be enough to sustain the growth that's already 18 months behind thanks to BS.   
BS does not want big blocks because they want all transactions under there control and paying thier fees on LN. 
If LN comes first, BS is in complete control. If you think that's good idea, vote for it.

Because LN does not belong to, nor is it in control of the users like Bitcoin as it was originally intended.
I'm 100% out of bitcoin. Bitcoin politics are a disaster, greed is winning out and not in the way Satoshi hoped. Control is more centralized than ever with trolling and incredible campaigns of misinformation.

They're called Chase because your have to chase them around all the time to correct their mistakes or get other business taken care of.
My mortgage is through Chase, I know first hand. Someone there fat fingered an extra zero onto what my expected escrow balance needed to be for the year. I was sent a notice stating my mortgage payment would increase by $1000/mo for the next year. It took months of chasing them to get it resolved.

Do you deny that Blockstream has intentionally hobbled the bitcoin blocksize from growing beyond 1MB in order to make their own privatized lightening network (from which they will privatley earn massive fees) necessary?
Bitcoin does need lightening networks eventually, 1MB blocks are an arbitrary, self-imposed limitation that has hurt much of the growth and adoption that should have happened over the last year and a half.
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:57:09
In the meantime blockstream has needlessly choked the network with the 1mb blocksize to meet thier own ends. They've built in this now desperate need for the size increase to get their private project adopted. Their latest move in this campaign is "ok, we'll give you slightly bigger blocks, a temperary band aid, just adopt Seg-wit, the protocol to  basically turn ownership of bitcoin transactions over to Blockstream. It's the quickest way to get bigger blocks so you should do it! Nevermind the trojan horse to take over and privatize the real network growth."
@_date: 2017-01-11 13:11:15
The "its not a payment system, its a settlment layer/store of value" belief is the result of the Blockstream propaganda machine. They have been extremly effective in twisting the narative for personal gain. 
This is largley due to heavy handed censoship of opposing ideas on this very subreddit.

Good to hear. I really enjoy the content you create Adam. Hearing from guests like Adam Back and Gavin who are working on the core of these big ideas is amazing and always interesting. Listening without distracting audio artifacts on the guest vocals would certainly be a welcome improvement to an already top notch podcast.

Diversify. 
Goldman Sachs is worth around $45 Billion. (
That means $50 million represents approximately 1/1000th of the company's net worth. To my uneducated, uninformed eye, it looks like them just diversifying their risk portfolio. 
In regards to Circle this is a huge story! In regard to Sachs and especially Warren Buffet, this is a non-story.

**Try:** 
They have a great betting model. No accounts at all. A new address is generated for each bet you wish to make. Click the link in the browser, it opens your wallet, send the amount of bitcoin you want to bet to that address. When the bet settles it is immediately paid out to your own bitcoin wallet address. Settlement happens quickly any your only risk exposure is on your in-play money. 
**Note:** Their prices come from exchange betting sites, so if those markets don't have a lot of action you could take a bad price if you're not careful. On the other hand, in most markets the prices are extremely competitive.

Can you elaborate on discussion vs. promotion?
Could users make a list of pros and cons? If one user lists the pros of XT is that promotion?
Conversely, if a users lists the cons, is that then discussion?
Please give some example statements of each.

"Far more secure" is just plain wrong. However, what they intended to allude to was that Azure and Consensys are allowing them to set up private blockchains, essentially with permissioned miners. The big plus isn't really security, it's that it keeps the data private. 
The knock on private chains is that you could just run a private database instead, but the draw for banks is the incorruptibility of Ethereum code execution and that it can let their database interact with competitors without having to trust the competitor. Consensys is currently pitching this as sort of an easy to use blockchain sandbox for businesses, "fail fast, fail safe" is there talking point right now. It gives institutions an easy and relatively inexpensive way to experiment with blockchains and provides consulting from some of the few experts that exist in the world. It makes a lot of sense.

21 aims to makes bitcoin transactions easier for everyone. The 21 computer provides a dedicated hardware/software package aimed at that purpose only. The current model hardware is really only a vessel for the software, the final hardware will not be, or look like a raspberry pie, it will be a custom designed board for 21's express purposes. The current model hardware is just the fastest-to-market solution for getting the software in the hands of developers. 
One of the main tricks of the 21 computer is microtransactions. Right now a bitcoin transaction costs about $0.02 . This cost is far too high if you want to pay something like $0.001 for a small service. 21 will use the mining power of all its distributed devices to get around this. Whenever a 21 device mines a block it will include all 21 written transactions in the block for free. This makes microtransactions possible that are currently not possible in any other way. 
(I'm not an expert on 21. If I've mis-spoken, please correct me, this is simply how I understand their business model to date.)

I'm embarrassed to learn this is true.
More PoS for me on this account (Proof-of-Stupidity). I learn more in the bitcoin community by accident than I do most other places by design. This is an eye-opener. (No pun intended)
Thanks for the humbling correction.

Ethereum is an enormous undertaking. It is so much more than an alt coin! It's a ground up programming language that creates a entirely new paradigm for the internet and computing.

Have you considered running a limited edition print of this through an art shop? Signing them and adding QR codes with some sort of a digital asset tracking mechanism/coin could be a really interesting project.
Cryptoart.com had me interested until I realized they were just fancified paper wallets that SOMEONE ELSE has printed the private key to! They are not trackable assets. 
You have the opportunity to be a pioneer in this area!
