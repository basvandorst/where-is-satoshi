Complete bs and nothing of this has anything to do with Bitcoin being guaranteed to hit 1000 again. 
Edit - you downvoters are just ridiculous. This place is insane.

Till your precious coins get stolen or your product doesn't arrive without a way to get your money back. 
Then you come here posting how you were ripped off. 
Add that to the list of things i don't have to do when using Mastercard.

I've been to Thailand and i have products shipped to Thailand without any problems. This was roughly 3 years ago. So unless everything changed this isn't a normal situation. Credit cards might not be perfect and out of the millions and millions of users some might run into problems but in general it works great and i see no reason whatsoever to switch to Bitcoin instead.

No, the future currency of the internet is only safe if you store it offline.

No. If nobody buys them it won't go up in price. Your basic economics theory left that out.

Funny how this mainly seem to happen all the time to die hard pro-bitcoiners. They have nothing but problems when using their card while the rest of the world hasn't. Such coincidence.

I'd love to see some stats. 
1000 orders made through cc's and 1000 orders through Bitcoin. And then we'll look at which system works best. 
I think the result won't be upvoted to the top of this sub for some reason.

Because we all know you can't have an opinion after 17 hours of signing up. 
When will my opinion be valid exactly? After how many days?

So the Bitcoin hub of the world is half a dozen bars that probably do 1 transaction a week. After 6 years. 
Sounds promising.
