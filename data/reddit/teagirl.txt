I concur. Just another clickbait article trying to cash in on the interest in Bitcoin and fear of the unknown.

95% of Americans would reply: "What the hell is Bitcoin?"

I imagine most of these searches were done in the first quarter when it was all over the news.

Bitcoin, or something like it, will definitely become something of general use or at least mass awareness at some point. It might take 50 years, could take 5, could be 6 months. No one knows. It's still just a speck on the radar but it is on the radar. I applaud your enthusiasm and interesting marketing approach. Glad you had a good time in my state. All the best!

People should concentrate on its value as a way of distributing money, not as an investment. In addition: So many love feeling smug when something (or someone) doesn't live up to expectations and "falls back down to Earth". It's shitty human nature.

I still don't think the majority of the population has ever heard of bitcoin but if I was the waitress I'd be like "whoa" after finding out its worth. Side note: I live in NM and the Sandias are a powerful beauty.

I honestly don't know what the rewards for owning bitcoin are. Perhaps if you sold some at the height a year back you'd have made out ok. Right now what I find interesting about the whole thing is how money is distributed. Bitcoin has the potential to provide some financial freedoms other forms of currency don't have. To me that is its true value.
