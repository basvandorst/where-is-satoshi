Opportunity costs. Money sitting in a checking account earning basically zero interest is losing value every year. The bank, meanwhile is loaning it out at a much higher rate. You are "paying" the bank with that interest you could be making. 
Or at least that's what I think he meant?

If you pay with bitcoin then wouldn't you not need to pay gains since you're just paying with another currency. It'd be like buying it in euros, no?

On twitter he said he plans to keep running the exchange "forever?", so you can still trade Goxbtc if you really want to. 
@_date: 2014-01-07 19:19:01
Then just wait until BTC is less volatile. Your company is risk adverse enough to bring up these various deal-breakers, so it looks like holding a highly volatile currency isn't in the cards for your company right now.

I think you're probably trolling but... The credit card is the far superior transaction method for purchases. 
1) You have an effectively unlimited purchasing power in something the size of a business card. $1 or $10 or $10 - it's all the same.
2) If you lose it or if its stolen - you don't lose any money. 
3) Since everyone takes CC's and CC's charge fees to give their customers no liability and things like cashback and points if you pay with cash you are paying for those boons but not receiving them (unless the place gives a cash discount). 
4) It's more difficult to track purchases and expenditures with cash as compared to a CC that has a digital log - much easier for budgeting and expense management. 
5) No change. Coins suck. 
6) Cash is fabric/paper/weak plastics/etc. Credit Cards are more durable. You can take them in the ocean or to a concert and don't have to worry about them being destroyed/gross/etc. 
7) You never run out. You don't need to "hit the ATM". Or "break a bill". Or any physical management of your money. You don't need a money clip or a wallet. Just a place to stick your card. And since you probably have your ID on you, which conveniently is the same size, just stick it with that. 
The only thing cash has is no transaction fees and anonymity.

Real wage is the same thing as purchasing power.

Sure but that's not NAFTAs fault. That's just what happens as we automate the world. Changing NAFTA won't change that and we should not want to change it. Just need to adjust how we deal with it 
@_date: 2016-12-05 03:25:33
That's not how trade works at all. It's not zero sum. First, there were losers, just like with the auto workers, especially in agriculture. But Mexican experts have soared and consumer goods have halved in price increasing the quality of life for millions across the country. It's economy is now the size of Canada's.  That's how trade works. You stop doing what someone else does better and trade with them what you do better. 
And I'm not sure you can say they are taking our manufacturing jobs but have no industry of their own. Or ignore their growing middle class that has formed because of their explosion of imports and exports making things affordable and opportunities possible and saying we are keeping them broke.
Their GDP has more than doubled and have received billions in investment dollars. Of course there is room for things to get better but that's how their economy will continue to grow.

Outside of the housing crash your purchasing power hasn't been dropping. 
@_date: 2016-12-09 17:12:53
That's literally what real wage/purchasing power is calculating. And it's not. 
You might -think- it is. It might -feel- like it is. But it's not.

If by select groups you mean most people in the American economy. NAFTA cost us about 200k jobs, which is terrible and the government should have done more to help those families. But we have gained about $400k in economic benefit per job because of the pact. And that's 200k jobs over about a decade, which is about how many we gain in a month these days. (Sources:    and many more)
@_date: 2016-12-04 23:24:48
No I said NAFTA had an economic benefit to the economy. Also the number of jobs we lost because of it was about the same number we create in a month. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 03:29:52
Why are you against automation? Why wouldn't we want to be more productive with less labor? Should we ban cars so we can have rickshaws back?
Why shouldn't companies close that can't compete on costs? Should we sirens tax dollars to prop thank up? That's what tariffs are you know.
The shrinking job market is a problem but forcing things backwards isn't a solution.

They aren't buying on market. There are several off-market vendors for buying Bitcoin in large quantities. If you want to buy 10,000 BTC in any short amount of time, you can't use an exchange because the order books are so thin.

It means, if this is on the level, you could take a wallet and decode its keys in ~100 hours if you have the computing resources. If they are using the same version of AES, which I couldn't confirm.

Right. I was responding to the idea that artificially intervening in a market makes corrections worse. When in fact, it can prevent hysteria, because people are rarely rational when their survival (money) comes into play.

They could buy all the bitcoins people were willing to sell. Though they would have to pay an amazing amount of money for them. 
But then people would just switch to Litecoin.

I feel like hoarding is temporary. When bitcoin was at ~100 for several months, the investing aspect went away and people used them a great deal more. The huge influx of new comers is driving up the price, but I suspect at some point, we'll have another equilibrium price, maybe ~1000 maybe 100,000, and it'll hover there for some time.

It's very possible. But the problem is moving fiat around. It's very time consuming and expensive these days with most exchanges, especially in USD.

Hey Dario, 
I've been setting up my account at my-btc.info and am running into some issues getting my balances all correct. I think it has to do with deposits and withdrawals and moving my coins to different exchanges/wallets. I'm using the custom API for most of the exchanges, but do I have to do anything fancy if I move coins from Coinbase to my Wallet and then to Bitstamp? What about pulling money out of bistamp or moving from Litecoin to my wallet on BTC-E? I'm not sure how to record these things, or if I have to at all, but my reported balance is quite a bit too high for BTC, and quite a bit too low for LTC. Any suggestions on what to add/look for to get it correct? 
PS When I try to set my timezone to -8, it just saves it as -7. So that's weird.

$100,000 a bitcoin would make bitcoin worth about 1/5th of -all- USD, and more than the GDP of all countries except the top 8 or so. It may be reachable, but it's exceedingly optimistic to think it's quite reachable.
