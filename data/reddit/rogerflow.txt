Excellent book.

The store of value is an important feature we have with Bitcoin; This is the reason the price of Bitcoin increases over the years. And Bitcoin is alone in the cryptocurrency space with the proper features.
Here the reservation demand concept:

A good article explaining why only the shitcoins can be listed today; And why the premine is important for them to afford the exchange costs; The marketing costs and so on... The only new and innovative technology today in this field is 'lightning'. So the development itself for these ICO projects is mainly worthless.
To summary to start a legitimate company today; a classical IPO is more affordable than an ICO. The ICO is only relevant for non legitimate company; for decentralized software not so decentralized (when we look closer)...

lol, Bitmain and his one million BCASH is about to understant what 'shitcoin' means... This is not a figure of speech, Bitcoin dominance is now over 52% and accelerate.

We can report fraudulent site, and this is used for instance by firefox:
Have you tried?

Good news - Nevertheless the 'deceptive site' used by firefox still not flag this site (Help / Report deceptive Site)
Have you tried?

Indeed, Max Keiser was right on Bitcoin all over these years.
@_date: 2018-08-16 12:52:12
You are right. And I suggest to the BCASH's people to read this thread:
Gregory Maxwell wrote an honest and thorough answer to the technological questions.
And if you are looking for an Economic standpoint, the book: 'The Bitcoin Standard' is fascinating.

Good show. Tone Vays has a deep understanding of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-08-08 10:24:49
Good article.

Blockchain can't scale. Gregory Maxwell wrote a very good answer to the TPS question:
Beside, 'Lightning' is the right answer and the proper technology tool, for a Bitcoin payment system that can scale at any level.

Indeed: [

This other thread: [ make some points; The 'store of value' is the key element that make the price of bitcoin rises over the years; 'ETH' is from a technological perspective more and more centralized and so unusable, and defeating its own purpose. And I may add 'XMR' is legit (no premine...) but can't scale.
The more important: 'BTC 'is 'sound money' and we need only one.

Reporting the site using the Firefox: 'Help / Report Deceptive Site' function is likely a good idea.
@_date: 2018-08-15 22:44:41
The book 'The Bitcoin Standard' does a great job to present the essence of Bitcoin. Understanding the 'Economic'  behind Bitcoin is more than useful.
Great interview too.

Tone Vays is right we are still in a bear market. Bitcoin is now over 7000, and immediately the shitcoins are pumped again. Do you really think Bitcoin will be over 8400 the previous high? Otherwise the fall will go on again.
I think we will have to wait for a 80% Bitcoin market cap, before a successful bull run.
You must look at this other show where he is a guest:

This site deserves to be flagged by the Firefox phishing mechanism too (Help / Report Deceptive Site). This is still not the case today - We must fix this.

I keep my 'hard money': Bitcoin, and spend only easy money... 
These people lack Austrian Economic knowledge. In a way they are not so different from BCASH people.
@_date: 2018-08-23 17:10:03
Hard money as gold was in the 19th century. Bitcoin is scarce.
Easy money or shitcoins are an unlimited resource; And definitely the opposite of what Bitcoin is.

These 'alts' projects are just scams; Most of them are just clone of the bitcoin repository, with just some stupid ideas added as features; I can't count them anymore on the last six years. Bitcoin main proposition is money; these projects are just useless on the economic side too.
People need to learn; They can think about what they are doing, or learn the 'hard way'. This bear market is just a reminder that the 'hard way' is the path chosen again.
