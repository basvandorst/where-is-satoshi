Central banks certainly did NOT prevent our economy from a collapse, they borrowed some time from the INEVITABLE collapse. Most of the dow jones gains are inflation via borrowed money. You can never ever spend your way out of a debt problem. They stole some of your purchasing power, via borrowing which devalued dollars you hold and gave it to fat cat executives in the form of bailouts and "stimulus". This is why prices on insurance, ultilities, food, and most other "need" expenses are going up way faster that the lie of 2% right now. That same actual percentage, more like 7-10% is what they stole from you. You MUST understand this. Inflation is a tax, it's a hidden tax. If people don't want to pay for the programs they want. That's fine, they will just steal it from you through borrowing and taking some of your purchasing power and then claim they have given you something for free.

Yeah sure because Keynesians have it all figured out. Inflate currency to infinitum, force everyone into risk, create a culture of debt=prosperity, create a world of slaves to the centralized power of the owner of the fiat printing press.

soon after the US Gov would launch operation "Zimbabwe freedom" to free the people of that country from some quickly made up terrorist or tyrannical leadership threat in respect to "world peace". All throughout history when a sovereign state that does not have nuclear weapons tries to snub the US financially, they get invaded and bombed. The only people that can snub the US and get away with it are the big boys like China and Russia. Having said that, I do believe someone will try. Its only a matter of time.

"Your income would be reported as class C income", by whom I ask? I certainly did not and will not. Also if you buy silver at an exchange and the transaction is under $500 there is no paper trail. It doesn't get reported if you buy with cash. There is a yearly amount and as long as you don't exceed that, they will not report it. I believe it is $3000/year. I know because I've done it more than once. The silver that I buy, I buy loooooong. I am not planning on exchanging the silver back for dollars, EVER as they will hit me with a gains tax on the back end. Its a long term hedge. I plan on trading them directly for goods in the future. No money, no taxes, my business, because they are my assets and I am the sovereign man.

Yeah its illegal, and they will be prosecuted. They will go out of business for legal reasons. Doesn't really matter what currency they are using.

I wish we could just opt out of the pre-determined system contraints. Example: It's the law to have a pre determined "qualifying" insurance policy. Where as some insurance policies would not be accepted. This is where the government is in bed with the insurance industry, so the qualifying policies are ones in which have the Government's blessing, and which pay the Government their "acceptance fee". Obama-care is no different.

All this talk of CA being able to successfully secede from the nation. You do realize they will take all their debt and future debt with them right?? Here are some 2014 numbers to ponder. 2014 CA debt per capita: $3990- (20th highest in the nation). 2014 CA budget deficit: 27.8%-(3rd highest in the nation). CA 2014 1st quarter unemployment- 7.8%-(Ranked 47th in the nation). CA isn't as rosy as you claim. I wish they would secede, good riddance with their bananas spending legislation. And they can take their tyrannical, drone loving, NSA lapdog senators like Feinstein and Boxer with them. CA's rulers are doing everything they can to make doing business in CA harder and harder. Big and small businesses are leaving CA in droves. They are going to places like TX and AZ. Tech is all CA has left. And even they are starting to leave CA too.

Not trying to be nit picky or anything. But there is essentially no interest in bank accounts anymore. The Fed lowered rates to basically zero. So you don't have to worry about not making money via interest anymore. They did this to force everyone out of the cash positions and back into risk, via the Dow Jones casino.

No they don't they don't go after barter transactions. What the hell are you talking about. On what paper trail ledger do barter transactions exist?? When you trade someone silver ounces for a bunch of ammo, do you call your bank and tell them to write it down somewhere?? Maybe you phone it in?? Certainly they will and are going after BTC. That's a no brainer, it does have a completely transparent ledger after all. It's the IRS's wet dream.

It was very confusing. But sure after 1 BTC= 1,000,000 USD at 80% world's population user adoption then 1 BTC won't go to 1,000,000,000,000 with an addition of another 5%. I can live with that.
@_date: 2014-04-20 17:33:59
Exactly!!! +1  especially when the only ratio they establishment looks at is GDP/Debt ratio. So they have to find ways to make "GDP" bigger. The reason I put GDP in quotes is did you know that some of what we call a "product" in this country is: rent people didn't have to pay themselves because they own a home. Are you kidding me?? I could go on and on of all the ridiculous things we "produce" in the USA but it would be too long of a post. So yeah, all they have to do is make shit up for "products" and then voila! The numerator gets bigger and the debt has less meaning. This is how they argue that they are solvent, and thus how they can keep printing(monetizing debt) your purchasing power away, while at the same time diminishing their debts owed to China and everybody else that have borrowed form over the years.

I agree with you. Also BTC wouldn't exist if the US Gov wouldn't have messed up our money(USD) by outsourcing it to the Fed Reserve and then letting them devalue it by 98% in just over 100 years!!! They screwed up, now the Kraken(BTC) has been released on them!!!!!!

Not sure if this post helps but I have used Brawker probably 12 times. Every time it has been a good experience. I wish there were a little better communication options on the website, but I suppose it's limited to protect each parties privacy. Usually takes 1 to 2 days to get the coins if you are buying BTC. Not sure how the experience is on the other end if you are selling BTC. There are some flaws I suppose. One example is what happened to me the last time I used it. I purchase items for the seller. He finalized the order BEFORE he received the tracking number. About 1 day later I received an email form Amazon stating that one of the items were no longer available and my card would be refunded. This was AFTER I had received all of the BTC from the seller. Luckily the thread for communication was still open on the order so I sent him a message asking him what he wanted to do. He was thankful as I could have not contacted him and pocketed both the BTC and my refund. He posted his public address and I sent him the difference, problem solved. Just a warning make sure you at least get the tracking # first and better yet wait until delivery before finalizing the transaction. Cheers.

I just left college to take a job with my father's business. We sell agricultural equipment. The business is expanding and he needs my help. About 3 weeks ago we were approached by a group from Ghana to possibly buy quite a bit of our equipment as part of the new president's initiative to boost agriculture in Ghana. It will most likely be in the millions of dollars worth of equipment. All I can think about is how to make the money part of the deal work with bitcoin. I have slowly been introducing my dad to the bitcoin space. I am curious how much if any could be saved by just using bitcoin instead of converting from Cedi to Dollars and then wiring the money. Any thoughts on Ghana's legal stance on bitcoin? I so want to try and make this Ghana ag deal as bitcoiny as I can.

Sure, I'm sure you are in your lollipop unicorn farting rainbows everything looks great from here world of not accounting for most things inflationary in your measure of inflation world. In MY world inflation is more like 7-10% year over year. But sure all you have to do is change what the definition of inflation measure is to get 2%.

If you are using bitcoin as a currency then who cares what the price is. Buy it and then use it and you won't lose anything. If you are holding some bitcoin then you didn't "lose" any "money" unless for some reason you have to sell today. All this panic all the time in this community is funny. If you are holding then this is great time to keep holding and maybe keep buying to add to your holdings. Don't "sell" unless its above where you bought in. Bitcoin still works, the protocol is sound, go outside and get some sun and relax. Stop staring at your computer all day constantly hitting refresh and panicking. It seems a lot of this panicking is from people that are holding bitcoin that couldn't afford to hold. If your gonna hold you better have the patience to hold through these storms, otherwise you best just buy and use.

Lets all just try and relax and enjoy this buying opportunity. We are making history, if your here now, you are still way early and way ahead of the heard. WE will be the people saying "yep I bought some at 400 or 300 or maybe 200??". Remember where this thing was only 3 months ago.... Oh yeah around $1000. Well who knows maybe it will be $2000 2 months from now. I see tons and tons of VC money dumping into this thing as we speak. There are start-ups all over the place coming online soon. The ATM's are rolling out all over the planet. Soon a major nation state will see this as their opportunity to make a statement will declare bitcoin a currency. It's coming.

Thanks for bringing awareness to this topic. I agree people need to be skeptical as this is a new economy appearing before our very eyes. While I do agree we need to be skeptical, I think what you are seeing is people's over-joyed pent-up exuberance for the "hope and change" revolution we have been waiting for. I think a lot of people have been disillusioned and have felt hopeless at the current state of our country and almost every other country in the world. There is a sense of a revolution of the meek taking back their vote, voice, and power back which is almost palpable. It's like a feeling of electricity in the air, and at any moment a spark is going to take us to the moon. So back to the point.... I do agree we need to be vigilant, but lets keep the hope and faith energy going because I believe we are on to something. I believe we could be participating in the beginning of a wonderful revolution where no shots need to be fired.

Everybody knows that Amazon has low profit margins. They have even been made fun of for it. Overstock also has low profit margins, they both have to do really high volume to stay in business. Overstock saw bitcoin and realized it's basically free money because of the savings on transaction costs. I know Amazon knows this as well. I'm sure Amazon has been closely looking at Overstock's bitcoin profits. The REAL question is why is Amazon choosing not to take free money?? Are they being pressured by the Government??

Bring it on I say. They can only cry wolf so many times before people will start ignoring bad news all together. Get the jitters out of the way I say. It will only make BTC stronger in the end

Cant tell you where to buy. Have no idea about where this is heading. That being said I fully believe in the security and utility in bitcoin and the bitcoin protocol. I am personally buying every 2 weeks regardless of price. I would only change this position if something changed in the protocol's security. Right now its solid so I am buying. Good luck with whatever reason you are getting into bitcoin.

I guess we need to start our own banks too

I had the same problem but with entering the expiration date. It asks for month first and then year but by default it starts at current year. So for example if my exp date was 01/16 It would at first by default in the year column be on the current year-2015 but it would ask for month first. Of course I would go looking for 01 or January , but it would not let me select because January  of 2015 is no longer available. So I had to skip ahead and select 2016 and then go back on select 01 or January. Maybe your problem is somehow related.

I believe that the guy wearing the rainbow wig has as much credibility to be Satoshi as Mr. Wright does. Actually now I want to believe that rainbow wig guy IS Satoshi!
