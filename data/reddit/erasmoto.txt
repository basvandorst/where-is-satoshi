Alright, I’ll play along:
So by password I believe you mean the secret to the encrypted wallet?  So they would need physical possession of the bitcoin wallet along with the password to decrypt the wallet.  In that case yes I would be out of luck.  
When you send coins from a Bitcoin wallet it goes something like this: your wallet should always be encrypted by default, so the next step is to try to send the money from the client-&gt; decrypt wallet-&gt;Sendcoins-&gt;encrypt wallet.  If someone has hacked my computer throughout this process then I’m screwed.  So I can mitigate theft by keeping my wallet encrypted at all times, offline when ever it's not needed and lowering the probability of getting malware on my computer by using a separate computer strictly for Bitcoin and not for surfing porn.
With the credit card scenario, anytime I go to a restaurant it can be skimmed, if I buy online, the data can be comprised at all phases of the transition: during the transmission of the data or even later if the company has your credit card info in a database and the database gets comprised, ATM skimmers, malware, door to door salesman, and Gas pump skimmers to name a few.  A lot of this risk is completely out of my hands and I can do very little to mitigate any of it, so I would expect some type of protection from my bank.

Key word **Military**.  I'm wrapping up my time and will be getting out soon.

I guess I should have stated better, I get fraudulent alerts and notifications like these
26371: Msg(1/4) USAA ALERT: Please verify Credit Card Charges for your card ending in ----: Date: 28Nov Amt: $63.**
But in this instance, I didn't get any warnings.

So I wonder if they stole someones card with 10k would they allow 95 of these transactions go through.  11 seems crazy enough.
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:46:57
So will a cashier they just keep running a card over and over until until a card cannot be charged anymore?  Or was the cashier in on it?

[How Stuff Works: ATM Skimming](
[Brian Krebs artical on ATM skimmers](
Most of these are outfitted to steal your pin, in addition to your ATM card data.
Banks have fraud departments, they are better outfitted and probably have a better chance of dealing with authorities then I would via telephone or email from Japan.

Sweet, all the Nigerians that keep emailing will now have a way to get all their money out of the country.

Did you get your money back?
@_date: 2013-12-07 17:41:55
I know it sounds convenient but we don’t have any cards attached to our USAA savings account.  They are located in Texas and do not have any local banks.  But I will now have something local because of this.

Alright Here we go again:
Man-in-the-middle: What is he going to do? Broadcast my transaction on a peer to peer network?  There is a vulnerability when you are sending coins to an IP address, but who sends coins to an IP address instead of a bitcoin address (this can only be done through the command line with bitcoind).
Keylogger: This goes back to malware from the earlier post.
Shoulder surfing: Again, I can mitigate this by not decrypting anything in front of other people.  
Blockchain app? I don’t use it.
For the second time, I can limit my exposure to these risks.  I don’t have a web wallet, this is not the main client, I’m not willing to take that risk.  **With banks I have no choice but to take the risks of using cards, so they should be responsible for their weak security infrastructure** With Bitcion I get to choose what exposures I’m willing to risk.  I’m not forced to do any I don’t feel comfortable doing.  Who knows maybe in the future there will be some type of insurance offered for people that scan a QR code on a telephone pole and accidently send all their Bitcoins to a sticker.
How do you feel about the dumbasses [flaunting their credit cards on twitter,](  I don’t think they deserve their money back.
You can chose the level of security you want to have with your Bitcoins.
A credit card is much more convenient, but the tradeoff is no security.
Bitcoin isn’t for everyone.

I know this doesn't carry any weight, but it's what I got.

Calling bank now, since I'm not going to bed anytime soon anyway.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:58:06
Yes, I didn't talk to the bank directly, emotions were running high, so the second hand details I got probably weren't 100% accurate.  I'm happy say it's done with and I can go back to sleep.

Thanks for this.

Thanks for the suggestions, we do bank with USAA.  I've been with them for over 10 years.  They are always awesome to deal with.  It's the whole debit card issue that no banks seem helpful with when it comes to fraud.  Her credit card was damaged and the new one was on its way.  I'm the only income provider, so she only has one credit card I have the rest.  She's getting a back up credit card along with a Google wallet card so we have more contingencies just in-case something like this happens again.

Yes, the whole system we is built with an antiquated security infrastructure we have to deal with what we have now.  Upgrading it would require the money to stop rolling in, so I don’t know what would ever fix this.  What I would like would be a [TOTP] ( that is synched up with my bank and use the Token as my pin for withdrawals and in-person purchases or the TOTP as the security code for purchases made online.

It was at a local Starbucks and around 80 dollars total.
