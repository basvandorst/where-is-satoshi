Lightning Network. It is the only viable solution for a decentralized currency system. Until then small transactions are not worth doing for most people, and Bitcoin will remain a bet on that future.

From what I heard it's a split, 10% up 10% down, but I only saw that in a reddit comment so maybe not. Vertical run up is expect as the masses flow in, I guess time will tell what happens next.

The winklevoss twins still have the power to shake the market drastically, but most of the other massive wallets are exchanges holding many peoples Bitcoin. The silly U'S government was recently the largest hodler of Bitcoin at 170k Bitcoin. But they auctioned them off for 7.8k per coin haha

I don't understand why an exchange would bet against a bull market like Bitcoin. Do I misunderstand futures?
@_date: 2017-12-09 19:28:33
Usually I am very bullish, but I think you should research the CME futures and hear some opinions on the way they will affect the price short term before pulling the trigger. But thinking long term I still think you'll make tons of money no matter what you choose.

Seems like there is less bubble talk lately. I agree though, new comers are notoriously shaky hands, it takes time for them to become reliable hodlers. Exponential growth of these people can create volatility, I think we are already seeing that from the thanksgiving surge. Overall though this stage of adoption is unavoidable and we just have to work through it.

People think it is, but technically it's supply is infinite due to infinite divisibility. It pretty much cheats economic theory of supply and demand. Soon the conversation will switch to Satoshi's, the more manageable unit of BTC.

@_date: 2017-12-07 03:16:43
Ya I was just joking. It is worth it though, you could run one or two machines probably without raising any eyebrows. Initial investment is pretty large though. Look up the antminer s9, that's pretty much what you need to be competitive mining Bitcoin. You could mine alts though as they have lower difficulty.
Edit:And there is a new mining rig coming out 2018 called the Dragons Den, it's supposed to be 30% more energy efficient so you might want to wait.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:48:28
As far as I know people add up many early days wallets without any possible confirmation and say they are Satoshi's to get the 1 million figure to spread as FUD. It's impossible to confirm who own's all those wallets, other than the safe assumption the initial transaction was his, the first Bitcoins he sent from it are confirmed to Hal Finneys address, who may be Satoshi but no one knows for sure . But maybe there was a statement from Satoshi I missed where he say's he has 1 million?

Bcash does not have backing of the community because it took place without consensus. It actually is slightly superior to Bitcoin but so are many altcoins, but a civil war within Bitcoin is bad for all cryptos. Once Lightning network is out Bitcoin will be far superior to Bcash and have the majority backing. Also Bcash is being led by a con artist.

To hold stable it would need to not be subject to the laws of supply and demand, somehow I can't see that happening :P This is just what universal consciousness of Bitcoin looks like and is an unavoidable stage in the adoption process. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:48:10
You should look into the Lightning Network, it is almost ready for release and will drastically lower fees and reduce transfer times. The mining market has two factors, more BTC value means more miners, more miners means higher mining difficulty, so if a bunch of miners decide to quit due to low value all of a sudden the miners still in it start mining more BTC, so there should be an equilibrium that prevents mining collapse. Wallet concentration is from exchanges and custodial services. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:22:30
Well it depends on what hardware you use and your electricity prices, but that doesn't matter if it's profitable people will do it. A good analogy is gold mining, nobody says "Gold extraction only costs X, therefor the cost of gold is going to crash to X." You realize their are other factors that give things value I hope...
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:33:50
I agree, big money will be trying to manipulate the price now with futures coming and try scaring veteran hodlers out to buy up their market share.

We've got a responsibility to keep the pressure on Bcash as a coup of the brand without anything even close to consensus among the community or core developers. I think OP's point was that the Bcash sub is way more about attacking Bitcoin than being positive about the currency itself.

I've made 4x my investment and somehow Hodling Bitcoin is still fraying my nerves. I tried shorting once and of course bought at the bottom of the panic sell, I told myself that's the only time I wanted to be taught that lesson but I was tempted when I woke up this morning :P
@_date: 2017-12-01 06:26:18
Increasing block size make's running nodes more and more expensive, which will lead to centralization. It only pushes the problem of scalabillity further down the road continually needing to up block size and at greater costs.

@_date: 2017-12-05 06:03:43
oh haha sorry. Okay upon a bit of further investigation they actually sold their bitcoin at a much lower price, I must have read the article at a much later date than publishing. They sold 144k of them at an average of 334$ per. Tim draper bought 30,000 of them, the rest were anonymous. strange, I was sure I saw something about 170k selling just around a month ago. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:24:55
Price fluctuations like that are the nature of Bitcoin, you've got to look at longer term trends. Number of sales isn't relevant because there is a buyer for every sale, it's the price of those sales that affects the over all price. As far as I know you can't see the fiat price of transfers on the block chain, places like coinmarketcap use aggregated data from many exchanges to produce their price.

So you think that the guys who sell futures are buying up now to dump, of course I've considered that but I think you are underestimating the bulls. There is a cap of 10% profit on these futures, I think we are going to see big money buy them and pump the price afterwards to burn the bears who are going to sell them. And I think they were a little late to the party if they want to crash it, there isn't enough Bitcoin for sale for big money to buy in the quantities to burn futures buyers, and they would just be encouraging more adoption buy pumping the price now. I don't think the now steady influx of 100k new accounts a day on coinbase is rich people getting ready to pump and dump Bitcoin. Time will tell, I think you could be right about the setup but I wouldn't be so certain, futures is a battle between the bulls and the bears and both will be trying to manipulate.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:06:59
Bears and Bulls will both try manipulating, remember that for everyone trying to make money selling a contract there is someone trying to make money buying it. Also consider that most rich people were late to the party and there isn't a lot of Bitcoin for them to buy for dumping. However, I think we might've seen an attempt at that with the massive price spike we saw this week.

Wall street has had their eye on Bitcoin for a long time, many fear a trap with the selling of futures. They are the attack dogs of fiat, I don't think they are on board with a decentralized currency that was monopolized by computer nerds long before they got to the party. They are used to 4-5% a year on their investments, they'll take Bitcoin for a ride until they've scared all the average people out.

@_date: 2017-12-04 03:57:01
Well to address your first and last point, they have taken their time because they wish to deal with Bitcoin's scaling problem in one move as opposed to creating divisions at every airdrop. We may not like that a small group of people decide it's future but it's necessary in my opinion to prevent community fragmentation and ultimately opening the door for something like an IMF crypto to take advantage. Moore's law also cannot continue on forever, we are approaching the limits, until we master quantum computing at least. Though I agree that improving hardware can help with the scaling problem of increasing block size. Also last I heard LN was through 72/75 tests on test net or something like that, those numbers could be wrong.

LN testing is in it's final phases, hopefully rolls out early 2018. Yes it will reduce fees by taking strain off the block chain and creating competition among lightning nodes for traffic. LN will probably be what pops the crypto bubble and all those useless altcoins will crash resulting in all their investors trying to dump for BTC. The same way the good companies survived the Dotcom bubble. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:29:04
Okay, so other cryptos can function as a store of value yes, why don't you invest in one of those?

I think most people understand it won't be overnight, but this should be their number one priority as it is life threatening to Bitcoin if fee's and transaction times cannot come down. Brian Armstrong recently brushed off a question about Segwit by saying it's "Probably not in the top five things customers are asking for" which is very worrying. To me this indicates the community should apply pressure via, Twitter, Facebook, Customer support, ect... I think they planned on just waiting for LN but adoption picked up so fast that this is no longer an option.

These swings are unavoidable if a fixed supply currency is to be adopted, so it's inconvenience as a unit of exchange will persist for quite a while. But once/if people are getting paid in Bitcoin they won't hesitate to buy things they need with it, they'll still be way better off than when the used inflationary currency. I can envision a future where social security can be left to the nature of deflationary currency, people can save less to have more in the future and will require less state intervention to stay out of poverty. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:22:57
People are constantly selling and constantly buying. The likelihood of a huge sell off at a particular number is remote, especially because Bitcoin is global and exchange rates mean that if it reach a nice sounding number in one currency it's something totally different in another. Some large event like a exchange hack or massive government crackdown could start a sell off however. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:46:30
One thing to consider is for every futures contract the exchange sells they've created a person with a vested interest in Bitcoins success since they can't just sell their Bitcoin at anytime, they're locked in. Since most people who play with futures are pretty wealthy they might pump the price to protect their position.
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:08:30
Yes, still cheaper than transferring gold though, especially over long distances :P You should look into the Lightning Network that is getting close to ready for implementation, it will lower fees drastically and get rid of network congestion.

@_date: 2017-12-08 01:33:11
You can follow the price on coinmarketcap, a better way to look at it instead of 1000$ increases is the percent it has increased since you bought. Much simpler. Once you purchase on coinbase you are locked in at the price you bought at, even if it takes time to go through. 
Edit:Also, Bitcoin shouldn't be viewed as an investment really, it's a currency, you're converting USD in BTC. There is a project called lightning Network coming out that is going to drastically increase transaction times and reduce fees.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:02:42
It's a complex subject with lot's of debate, you should do some research. But basically Wall Street is about to start betting on the future price of Bitcoin and people fear they will manipulate the price to protect their futures positions.

Blocksize increase will be required for Bitcoin even with LN, but my understanding is that the block size will need to continually be increased and at ever greater costs. Basically it's just delaying the problem until eventually you hit a dead end. LN should provide low fees as the node's will be in competition for transactions and people will usually chose the cheapest option. BCH didn't have enough consensus among core devs in my opinion, though I understand LN wasn't Satoshi's vision. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 01:57:45
The statistics don't paint the true picture, it appears like Bitcoin is concentrated in a few hands because the exchanges and custodial services hold millions of peoples Bitcoin. As for Satoshi, from what I've heard he has 6000 Bitcoin, that's relatively small compared to say the government of Bulgaria with 200k. Also whoever breaks the power of the central banks deserves a hefty reward if you ask me, he's taken us this far so I see no reason not to trust him now. There is inequality in both fiat and crypto systems but I chose the one where there isn't entities that can make money out of thin air.

Because Bitcoin has a distributed ledger you would need to get over 51% of the hashing power to agree your fake Bitcoin is real, which is very difficult with the spread of mining throughout the world. You can remind your friends that the federal reserve is creating money out of thin air everyday and putting it into the USD network, devaluing the money supply and making sure only rich people are allowed to borrow it :P

Hospitals and roads maybe, but the privatization of police and courts is a horrible idea. You know there would be abuse and divisions. Will each court make it's own laws? And who will stop them if they do, the neighboring community's private security guards? You're advocating that rich people can purchase their own army, how is that a good thing at all. You cannot decentralize the law and you cannot decentralize the use of deadly force. It won't work. You should research Milton Friedman, he proposes a reasonable approach to getting government as small as possible.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:48:23
There is plans for a blocksize increase along with LN, as far as I know. Core devs want to deal with scaling in one move to prevent community fracture, e.g. the leader/s of each fork claiming theirs is the real one. Look at Bcash, there is already plans for two forks in 2018, this leads to a dead end and lots of in fighting.

yep, welcome to the world of exchanges. Luckily Bitcoin has become more decentralized than any other crypto making this harder and harder all the time. Most of the BTC hodlers are seeing their influence diminished due to increasing supply and most of the whales slowly sold to hedge against a crash. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 00:59:56
Comparing Bitcoin to stocks is a mistake. Many altcoins are in a bubble because they will not have a use beyond speculation in how many more people will buy them. Most internet stocks fell in the Dot Com bubble, but the good companies made strong comebacks. Crypto market is in a bubble, that doesn't mean all cryptos are done for.

It's public knowledge the size of wallets. Until recently the U.S government had the most but they auctioned them off. It's harder to find out the networth of people in fiat than Bitcoin. And many big holders slowly sell off to hedge against the currency failing.

Your 50 Euro will grow relative to the % increase the the currency you buy, the amount of the coin you hold is irrelevant. Small amounts of Bitcoin are worth more because it's supply is limited, though infinitely divisible so people can still convert small amounts of fiat currency to it.

You can speculate on Bitcoin to make money short term without harming the network which is nice, but personally I'm skeptical of how the futures are going to play out for Bitcoin. The exchanges will want Bitcoin to go down after selling futures, and the buyers of them will want them to go up to protect their position, I'm not sure who will win but we can expect a lot of big money trying to manipulate the price of Bitcoin to make money off their futures contracts. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 10:26:27
I was mistaken, I think I got that from from an article talking about Bitcoin being at 6k and guessing how much Satoshi was worth, and thought it meant the initial wallet had 6k coins :P In any case as I said I think he deserves a massive reward if Bitcoin succeeds at breaking the central banks power.

It's okay, look at Bitcoins history in the charts. Veterans have seen this time and time again, eventually the hodlers outnumber the panic selling and it bottoms out. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 16:52:47
I think so, people are spooked by futures and selling is my guess. But there is plenty of reasons to believe futures will benefit Bitcoin once people understand them better.

Andreas is a proponent of the Lightning Network, and it's just around the corner. There will likely be a block size increase with LN implementation, but the core devs want to deal with scalabillity all in one move. You may have heard Bcash already has two forks planned in 2018 to increase block size.

What a dinosaur. "Bitcoin has no inherent value", right, because the ability to send value across the world without third party interference is worthless.

By weight I mean dominance, as in number of users, no other crypto is even close. If Ethereum had as many users it would take up the same amount of energy. I haven't heard that, I have heard the Dragon Den mining rig is 30% more efficient and due out in 2018. Also that countries like Chile and Germany are paying people to use electricity as safe dispersal because their renewable energy resources are growing too fast. My entire province is almost run on hydro power, except remote areas. The futures have a debatable impact, instead of people trying to short Bitcoin trading the real thing they will be able to short it on paper, meaning their is no need to sell your actual Bitcoins, That would obviously be good for the price. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 11:31:41
Looking at the 7 day chart it looks to be about where it should be now. The insane spikes and dips come from liquidity, not adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:13:57
Fragmentation has occurred, and that's acceptable because there is a serious debate to be had about how Bitcoin should look. But I still side with the Core Dev's vision for LN and a Blocksize increase in one move as opposed to continually having forks to up blocksize. If they continue to throw their weight around after LN I might start to get uneasy, but they have taken us this far so I see no reason to not trust them now. Roger Ver should have sought more support before he branched of, now he seems more like BCH's dictator. It seem's like we have two choices, the BTC oligarchy or BCH dictator. I still keep my faith in the core team. However, I'll grant you that today, BCH is the better p2p electronic cash system.

Limited supply and high demand... It's interesting though because the supply isn't actually limited due to infinite divisibility, everybody's focus on the price of one whole Bitcoin is silly. In the future people will talk in terms of Satoshis. But the current hype around the price of one Bitcoin works well for creating hype and increasing adoption. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:18:37
You figure out what the very minimum a person needs to live is and tax the necessary percentage as a flat tax on people making more than that. Because the amount is minimal it will generally all end up back in the market by years end. A totally free market would leave a ridiculous amount of people in poverty without people to help them. I know of many families who can hardly get by, they would become violent without the support they receive simply because they need to feed their families. How about courts? who will pay judges, or force thieves and violent people to show up without police?

If Bitcoin is dethroned the competition to be "the one" will be horrible. We will end up with an IMF crypto. Bitcoin has critical mass, if it succeeds in implementing Lightning Network I don't think anything will stop it. Bitcoin or bust.

I don't think you'd get your whole investment back, but with these price increases possibly. Mining Alt coins is often better as the guy below said, you'd have to do some research on what's best though. If you live somewhere with cheap electricity it's probably still worth it. Also the machines produce a lot of heat(And the noise of a hairdryer) so some people have found ways to heat their homes and reduce expenses that way.
Edit:Heat of one machine is comparable to a 1500watt electric heater

I understand it to a certain degree, probably not Andreas Antonopoulos level though. I absolutely believe in it, the distributed ledger provides protection from systemic risk which I think is very important for monetary systems. Also I think Bitcoin got the economic recipe right, that is, limited supply as opposed to money creation via debt. I don't use it to transact frequently, we will need to wait and see if Lightning Network comes through for that. Without lightning Network I think we've got a major problem.  
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:02:10
People still need to spend money so they will, if you're getting paid in Bitcoin it won't matter anyways. Another interesting thing is that deflationary currency can work as a social safety net, as opposed to printing money for social security. In a world where automation is going to take so many jobs away we will either need a universal basic income or a deflationary currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:23:35

@_date: 2017-12-08 05:27:33
Stability can only be achieved with lowering demand or increasing supply, that isn't going to happen and I don't think they would be good for Bitcoin. This is what universal consciousness of Bitcoin looks like and was bound to happen if widespread adoption was to take place.

LN will act as a decentralized network of centralized nodes, Bilderberg cannot stop anyone from creating a node, all you need is some startup Bitcoin capital. The first layer of blockchain will still be available for transactions but will carry larger fees than using an off chain node. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:04:34
Well, their impact is very uncertain. One thing to consider though is that anyone who buys a future now has a vested interest in Bitcoin doing well until that time seeing as they cannot cash out. I still don't know why anyone would buy a future and not actually just buy some Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:48:34
Well wouldn't you only buy one if you expected it to go up, and sell them if you expected it to go down? Is it just the exchange selling them or individuals on the exchange?
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:21:18
Agreed. Coinbase has been a great ally for Bitcoin, especially in such an uncertain market it has stood tall. Also we can't forget it's shun of Bcash, probably prevented an all out civil war.

Too many unknown factors to do it reliably. Once you factor in fees it becomes a pretty large risk.
@_date: 2017-12-08 02:39:13
It creates fractures in the community, as we have seen with Bcash. Dealing with scaling in one move make's more sense, since Bitcoin is decentralized you would end up getting a bunch of people saying the fork they led is the real Bitcoin and this could quickly lead to Bitcoins demise. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 08:41:06

Hmm it does look like that. Crypto market bubble could be done. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 05:44:11
I agree, this correction is past due, but most people here will argue that Bitcoin serves a much greater function than gold does, at least as a store of value. Gold has some good applications which make it safe, but many people place a much higher value on Bitcoin's use case. Yes I totally agree the network is pretty much unusable right now, especcialy as a unit of exchange. It only maintains it's current high value due to speculation about Lightning Network coming through. If Lightning Network becomes reality I expect Bitcoins value will be much greater than 10x production costs.

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:59:31

Umm basically everyone is worried haha. It's a way to bet on the future of bitcoin without having to actually sell your Bitcoin, which is kind of a good thing for Bitcoin. If you want to make 10% soon because you need money, but also believe in Bitcoin long term and don't want to sell it, this is good for those people and for Bitcoin as it moves shorters away from the real deal which is currently causing volatility. Of course what's scaring people is Big money trying to manipulate the market to protect their futures positions, it's uncertain at this point if the bulls or the bears will win that fight. But Big money entering Bitcoin is inevitable and this might be the best way for it to happen, only time will tell. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:37:25

Bitcoin has exploited the laws of economics by being infinitely divisible, that is why it's price seems so irrational. And yes it's growth is mostly because it's the most well known and most people desire a one world currency rather than hundreds of cryptos, so energy is channeled into the one with the best chance. If lightning network does not come through then we've got a major fire on our hands... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:17:45

The tulip comparison is absolutely laughable, they could've picked any other bubble and they are obsessed with tulips. Lucky for us I guess. Bitcoin is not a bubble, though sometimes liquidity issues push it's price higher than the rate of adoption can push its price. Sometimes this is fine because adoption catches up, other times we see a dip because adoption doesn't meet speculation. The nature of bitcoin is this, It is subject to supply and demand, but the supply is infinitely divisible so the supply part of the equation actually isn't very relevant. In a way it's an economic exploit on the minds of traditional market people who think the price of a whole bitcoin matters. It's a elegant mathematical strategy to encourage adoption that will continually reward adoption of the currency until a breaking point where other currencies start to rapidly inflate and there is nowhere for the money invested to go back to, the people who wait that long will be sorry. The only thing to watch out for is if Lightning network doesn't come through, then this will start looking like a bubble very fast. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:57:17

They are a threat but in my opinion only Bitcoin has the chance to become the peoples world currency, if an altcoin dethrones it the competition to become "the one" will be so intense that the IMF will get to choose our species currency, which will likely be a fiat clone that favors their buddies. I'm of the opinion we've got one shot at this, and we need to focus on making bitcoin succeed. Lighting Network is probably the most important piece to the puzzle.

Bitcoin essentially cheats economics. It's subject to supply and demand, but also infinitely divisible so not really subject to supply.

Bitcoin has reached critical mass, and thus is growing exponential. Amazon stock went up 1000% in 1999, and that was mostly a US based project at the time, Bitcoin is world wide and will totally revolutionize finance. I hear you though, everyday I feel like it's too good to be true. But I trust the numbers, Supply and Demand paint a very bright picture.

FUD dealers losing credibility and hodl's now have nerves of steel. So they try and make hodl's think other hodl's are breaking. Certainly some people are selling, but what is suspicious to me is the amount saying they sold it all, that is just foolish if you ever believed in bitcoin which one must have to hodl this long. Huge institutions may be warming but there simply isn't enough bitcoin available to go in huge all at once. I'm worried we will see a liquidity bubble as big money moves in. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:47:02
Yes, it's a cleaning of weak hand and healthy. A week from now they will think "Why did I do that?" and be back, hopefully stronger. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:22:30
Yeah, hodling is important for bitcoins future but the people with hundreds of bitcoin or less even need to start letting some of them into the market or adoption will be slowed and discouraged. I'm worried even if Bitcoin sees widespread adoption there will be a worse wealth gap than we see with fiat today. Ideally big holders would avoid the exchanges where big money will try and buying it up creating a liquidity spike and instead sell it in reasonable quantities to members of their community to encourage a healthy Bitcoin economy instead of hoarders. But regardless even the small time investors like you and I are doing well at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:26:58
Yes, the thought of the central bankers being kept awake at night fearing their control over the money supply will be taken gives me great satisfaction. Satoshi, real person or not, is a hero to humankind even if we fail.

Ya mainstream media lost all credibility calling Bitcoin a bubble over and over and over. Even older folks are starting to see the agenda behind the bubble talk. These commentators have HUGE stakes in the banks, or the people holding their leashes do anyways.

Gold still has intrinsic value though, however small it may be, and at this point Bitcoin is less secure gold. Lightning Network either comes through or Bitcoin collapses imo.

It's not as negative as most pieces out of Bloomberg, I'll give you that. But it still labels Bitcoin a bubble. A down turn in the overall economy would be welcome news for bitcoin, even if it hurts. But many banking, media and government entities say blockchain is good more as a way to keep people out of the current crypto markets waiting for something better. The whole Bitcoin is myspace, wait for facebook deal.

As the amount of BTC holders increases volatility will be reduced as each persons actions become a drop in the ocean. Even the whales will have trouble making a splash. This madness will necessarily slow, but a crash is unlikely without a severe government crackdown or exchange hack. We are witnessing adoption at an exponential rate, desire to leave the ship is at an all time low.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:26:05
Volatility is not a permanent state. And sure, fiat isn't volatile, it reliable losses 2% spending power every year! I'd rather spend money I have to, even if it might've grown if I didn't as opposed to hold it in an inflationary asset. If you invest all the fiat your job currently pays you into Bitcoin even if you spend it on the expenses you must and wish to have you would be far better off with the deflationary currency.
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:38:07
Just buy like 200$, there is a lot of worse things you could spend it on. Worse case scenario you lose 200$, best case scenario it becomes a world reserve currency or digital gold and you'll have thousands. Worth the risk imo.

Hope he feels the burn. anyone who thinks Bcash can play catch up with Bitcoin is delusional, Bitcoin market cap has grown about 70% since Bcash fork, new users aren't going to flood to Bcash anytime soon and most pre fork holders aren't going to have it either.

Lot's of states talking about making crypto currencies, but they won't because from their perspective everything crypto offers reduces their power to control people. If they do it will just be a fiat clone on blockchain wasting more energy than necessary.

It would take a multinational coordinated government effort though, because if some nations joined the other side and subsidized mining they would gain jobs and revenue, assuming they manage to tax the production. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:33:19
Very true, Bitcoin cannot function as a unit of exchange without Ln only a store of value which ultimately will fail to achieve anything of consequence towards the end of unseating the central banks as our overlords. Bcash did not have the consensus of core devs when it forked, essentially creating a very detrimental civil war in the community, luckily core has maintained it's dominance and there is still hope for a consensus move to LN. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:45:02
Bitcoin has reached critical mass. It was bound to hit this exponential growth point eventually if it was ever going to become adopted and accepted, a slow and steady up climb forever was never in the cards. I can't see a major sell off without a major government crackdown or exchange hack at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:02:55
Absolutely. I think many people don't see the value in peer to peer transactions across the internet, it has it's nefarious uses sure but what about the nefarious constraints government is currently forcing on people? Many foreign workers in the U.S(And I'm sure other nations) pay up to 15% transactions fees on money they've already paid income tax on to send to their families in their home countries, this is theft. Building economies around bitcoin is probably the most important aspect we can dedicate ourselves too, unfortunately this is unfeasible without Lightning Network unless you are dealing with large sums of money like car sales or construction. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:16:24
I've heard talk of an IMF crypto, if that comes true we will remember the struggle against Bcash fondly. A face off for the history books to be sure. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 04:56:15
I don't think colonizers will have any need for things like currency. In fact colonization of other worlds seems like a waste of time and resources to me, we should focus on getting VR for everyone and pile into mega cities. Until then crypto can hopefully help us get to that future. My biggest fear is that the control of the banks was actually our best bet at a unified civilization and that we will all just end up competing with each other more than ever trying to earn a piece of the limited supply of cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:31:05

Liquidity spike incoming. Hopefully some big hodlers let some Bitcoin go to keep the newcomers fed
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:39:19
It sounds like you have a good amount a bitcoin, buy yourself something nice and keep the bulk of it. Or maybe cash out half, or your initial investment... Personally I will hodl for life and spend what I need, same as fiat. But just remember money isn't what's important. I could lose it all and not shed a tear, it's not worth stressing during our short time here over something as intangible as currency.  
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:49:59
I'm not sure I do fully understand because it doesn't make much sense to me why anyone would buy a future and not a real bitcoin. My theory was that they sell you it for today price, it tanks, then pay you out on maturity the new lower price. If I was CME it's not an offer I would be making with the look of this bull market.
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:10:14

Critical mass has been reached. No one want's to be late to the party. Could also be big money creating a liquidity spike as there simply isn't enough BTC available for them to buy. This could be good or bad, depending on their intentions.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:12:57
I'm not informed enough to provide that answer. One of my fears though is the Chinese government seizing mining operations and carrying out a majority attack. But the thing is, if you control 51% of the network, who are you really hurting buy attacking it?
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:48:25
Hard to say, but I doubt a dip to 9k. there is a huge influx of new users and then they tell their friends, and so on and so on. This could be Bitcoins biggest bull run we've seen yet. North America going to sleep now and China usually out sells Japan/SK's buying so might see a minor dip. Also Chinese miners might dump more than usual with this surge. But probably will continue it's run tomorrow. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 07:25:19
It's possible there will not be a correction, at least not of the magnitude we have seen before. The further Bitcoin spreads and is adopted the closer to to the average it's moments will be, meaning less whales able to make a splash. But still, I hope the influx of newcomers have steady hands, they haven't dealt with as much FUD as veteran Hodlers. Thank goodness for coinbase's hold on new purchases. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:25:10
Not all of the new money, I'd say about 25% is short to medium term investors judging by this years dips. Most people I know of who recently invested did small amounts they felt fine losing all of, and aren't going to bother trying to cash out for less than probably 2x their money, at which time there will be an exponentially increased new influx of people with the same mindset. Many will convert to long term hodlers in the mean time as they research the technology and engage with the community. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:23:43

It may hint that Bloomberg is getting ready to accept defeat in their war on Bitcoin, or at least a ceasefire to stop making themselves look like idiots saying how bad it is while it's on a tear. I don't take this video to be as positive as you are making it out to be though, when you compare it to outlets that actually support Bitcoin. Though for Bloomberg it is a step in the right direction.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:53:36
Also worth noting, most of the thanksgiving surge came through coinbase. New users there will have roughly a 10 day hold on their funds, meaning we still have 5 days before they could start dumping. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 12:57:20
I think it's bad, why would an exchange agree to such a risky bet unless they have a strong reason to believe it will collapse. No Bitcoins are purchased with the futures. On the other hand, it might just end up burning the exchanges selling them and make them wish they'd actually just purchased some Bitcoin. One other pro is that it keeps big money away from the real deal, which can prevent dangerous liquidity spikes in Bitcoins value. I'm just worried they have insider info about a crackdown or something... 
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:39:31

@_date: 2017-11-29 02:31:01
Calm down mate, I watched the video. I'm starting to think you posted without watching the video. Bloomberg is the most anti Bitcoin media outlet there is. Saying it will go higher isn't an endorsement, it literally calls it a bubble. He says he is invested in blockchain, Bitcoin is not alone using blockchain meaning he is invested in other assets. Please watch the video before you comment. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 13:40:07
Seems to good to be true, I know. But this is what critical mass looks like. Also Coinbase has about a 10 day hold on new purchases so the thanksgiving influx(Which mostly went to coinbase) cannot sell or move for about 4 more days. Then there has been exponential growth since then too, along with the upcoming Big Bang theory episode which so far looks like it will be favorable... we could be approaching mainstream adoption. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:52:48
Totally, many don't care if the bank looks after thier money for them, the prefer it. I think these people don't realize the shitty deal they are getting but they exist non the less. And who really want's to participate in a monetary system where hackers became the worlds billionaires in the early days because the exchanges had insufficient security.

You would just sell it on an exchange, demand is huge. Coinbase is the most popular exchange in the US, but you won't be able to buy 5k all at once. Most in the community are hoping for a day we don't need to sell our bitcoin to spend its worth, and this is already happenings. In Japan and South Korea the ability to use Bitcoin like fiat currency is already widespread
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:49:55
Ha this is great! This is a much better way to look at it. We should try and spread this perspective on social media. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:30:57
I think this Bull market has another week or two left with the Nasdaq announcement and Big Bang Theory episode to come... Also something to keep in mind is the hold of selling for new coinbase accounts, still about four days out from the thanksgiving surge there from having the option to dump. That said I'm not buying anymore at the moment, happy to watch what I have grow.
@_date: 2017-11-29 11:58:38
Great story, raises some interesting issues with deflationary currency. However, the U.S and Chinese militaries are too strong and proud for this dystopian world to become a reality and we will probably continue to live alongside fiat. Personally I think the early adopters will be joining the rich, not replacing them. And also even if I had enough to retire from Bitcoin I would continue to work, just at different things based more on their value to me as an individual and their value to my community, as opposed to necessity.

There might not be "The next Bitcoin". Bitcoin is almost everyone's entry point into Cryptocurrency, has huge brand recognition and the benifit of being first in the game. It is so far ahead in the race it might not matter how fast the other coins can move. But there is opportunity for investment, Litecoin, Ethereum, Monero all probably have decent futures. Alt coins can be exciting to speculate in but not holding some BTC is bad crypto investing. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:55:46
Interesting. Upon some further investigation it looks like the auction was private so I wouldn't be surprised if these Bitcoin are actually still under the governments sway.

That's not true, his address holds 6k Bitcoin. I don't know the exact history so if he did have that much he put it into circulation.

@_date: 2017-11-29 07:36:28
Definitely some are here short-medium term, but I think most are betting on the long term future of Bitcoin. I know of very few people new to Bitcoin who invested large sums of money, usually about 200$ that they are willing to lose all of. Big money moving in could be a different story, but I don't think that was the prime driver of this bull run

It is their right, but the aggressiveness they have employed against core is unacceptable. Although they would probably have nearly faded without their tactics so I suppose I understand. I agree that a respectful relationship would be better and allow us to spend our energy advancing Bitcoin instead of fighting, if that was your point. But in my view Bcash picked the fight. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:14:52
I was getting worried about myself too, but most people are obsessed with thinking and talking about fiat money so I think it's only natural. Eventually we should probably want it to go away, but these are the days of the revolution so we should allow ourselves a healthy fix!
@_date: 2017-11-28 02:38:19
Bitcoin will need a hardfork in the future, but it was not BCash. Bitcoins market cap has increased 50% since Bcash fork, those newcomers aren't going to have any of this Bcash nonsense and neither will most of the pre fork holders. Bcash is nothing more than an attempted coup of Bitcoin with a few extra bells and whistles. Consensus was not involved.
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:31:13
Do whatever you feel is right. I will not be selling because I believe this is just the tip of the iceberg. People can call it a bubble and say Bitcoin and tulips are the same thing but why would this be the end? The fundamentals of Bitcoin don't show any cracks. Unless you have insider knowledge of a massive government crackdown or imminent hacking of several exchanges there isn't really any reason to think it's over. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:30:00
at 16 you probably have some important uses for that money, but I think putting some amount of it in Bitcoin might be a good idea. The right amount is an amount you won't be really disappointed about if you lose it all.
@_date: 2017-11-28 01:32:21
Coinbase probably won't be hacked or have their cold storage confiscated before your wallet arrives. Yes it is fairly simple, just make sure you've researched it well before you do it and send it to the correct address. I'm glad to see new comers purchasing wallets and not just letting their Bitcoin sit in an exchange. Good luck and welcome to the community!
@_date: 2017-11-28 00:40:13
Worst case scenario is you lose 300$. 300$ is nothing. Best case scenario Bitcoin becomes a world reserve currency or digital gold and you'll have thousands of dollars. Even if it drops it will in all likelihood rise above current levels. I think It's worth the risk.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:20:55
haha dude, at the bottom of the video it's titled "Bitcoin bubble grows bigger"
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:36:33
It won't stabilize until it reaches the end of it's totally growth potential, which is about 8 million per coin. I don't expect this to happen, that's just a very optimistic outlook where every fiat in the world is absorbed by Bitcoin. In reality Bitcoin will probably have to coexsist with several fiat currencies. Once a status quo it reached where people understand how much fiat they need to survive in their region vs. BTC the price will become more predictable. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:29:04
Wonderful! Without Lightning Network the revolution is over. The prospect of it is why I keep my money invested in Bitcoin. One could invest in an alt coin but I'm of the opinion that that if Bitcoin cannot achieve the status of world reserve currency and is dethroned by an alt coin the competition trying to be the worlds number one decentralized world currency will fracture the community so horribly that traditional powers will easily swoop in and claim hegemony once again. Bitcoin or bust.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:14:26
Bitcoin is a historic revolution, but we have an up hill battle to fight. If it fails to implement Lightning Network or get's dethroned by coups like Bcash there will be no other crypto that simply slips into it's place as number one, the competition will be brutal. In such a scenario the IMF will get to crown our species currency and do not doubt they will use it to control us and enrich their buddies as states have done with fiat. The world is not saved yet my friend, but we are here in time to at the very least give it our best.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:38:54
Coinbase currently has a roughly 10 day wait period before you can access your funds. This is frustrating but important for Bitcoins continued growth as it prevents new holders from dumping right away because they aren't comfortable with such a volatile asset, it helps people adapt. You'll be able to transfer to an offline wallet or another exchange after that period ends.  
Edit:waiting period might be significantly lower now actually, but high volume was causing long holds recently. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:56:27
I've never felt so awe struck, we are witnessing an economic revolution, the separation of bank and state. Lightning network cannot come soon enough though... 
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:20:48
Bitcoin cash is not a real threat, though we cannot ignore it and must continue to call it out for the coup attempt it is for people wishing they joined the revolution when Bitcoin was at at the level of Bcash. Biggest threat is the failure to implement Lightning network, without it Bitcoin is not a unit of exchange but a store of value, with it it is both. Another threat is the IMF, they haven't made their presence too overt yet but there is talk of them making their own crypto. It will be a fiat clone to be sure but will appeal too the many people who have been told blockchain is good but Bitcoin is bad. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:05:05

@_date: 2017-11-28 01:22:13
I would add that the supply is tamper proof, and for now the demand is more than people wanting to be millionaires but people who believe in the idea of Bitcoin replacing banks. Yes, there are lot's of people buying with the get rich quick mindset but if you look at this years short lived "corrections" it seems that only about 25% of buyers are here for short term. Most dream of a day we don't measure our Bitcoin against fiat.

Get a coinbase account and buy some Bitcoin even if it's a small amount. But don't expect that to fix your emotional distress, I highly doubt your mindset actually has anything to do with Bitcoin. It sounds like your financial situation is not good, even though you are working hard. I would recommend refocusing on things like physical health and being creative. It might seem like you don't have time for these with your busy life but you might be surprised how much time you spend worrying about these things that you could spend enriching your life experience.

I'd hodl, spend if you need to. Like gold, you hold it unless you really need it. Don't spend more than you can afford to lose. I don't know much about Xapo's security, but I'd definitely look into getting your own hardware wallet for cold storage.
