Yup, and FDIC insured for USD.

Too be fair good critics do work hard to find the flaws in something, and are able to explain their issues with something in a way that others can easily understand.  It's then up to others to show that those flaws have solutions that can easily be implemented or aren't really the flaws that the critics seem to think they are.

To be fair, they said a matter of time, not how much time.  I agree all current fiat currencies will eventually fail.  I'm not going to say it's any time soon, or even in my life time, but I'm pretty sure they'll all eventually fail.  ;)

How much of that NW is in their home's value?

Fucked or investigated? It's very different for the IRS to say "We're going to look into what you're doing, we think something might be up." And "You're now going to jail for tax evasion!"

Only if you fail to report earnings.

Now if I could only get Coinbase to get back to me about my account. They need to get more support people ASAP!

Not really, not any more (unless you're REALLY lucky, but then you may as well just buy a lottery ticket).
You can still do various alt coins, but for almost all of them you're going to want to do GPU mining.  Which if you're card isn't being seen by default, you'll have to compile the miner yourself.

So why don't you tell us how you came to this conclusion?  I'm genuinely curious as to your thought process.
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:14:45
Out of curiosity, what is your mining setup?
@_date: 2013-12-05 02:00:21
CPU mining for bitcoins?  You're going to lose money due to the difficulty and power costs.
Most bitcoin mining is now done with dedicated ASIC hardware.

First, I'm not going to downvote anyone that is actually willing to discuss the issue.
I think the one major issue with your assumption is that everyone that wants to hear about bitcoin has already heard about it.  Every day people learn new things, and some people finally make decisions to do things they've considered before.
Bitcoin isn't a scientific experiment with a set group of individuals and a control group.  It's far more dynamic and the pool of possible people involved is far far larger than the people that are currently involved (of course not all of them will ever buy in, but they are part of the pool of possible individuals).  Will it crash again?  I'm certain of it, but I don't think another major crash is going to come before we hit a new peak high.  Another minor dip at $1000 again?  Sure, but nothing major, just people thinking they can day trade again.

People should use a day trading simulator for at least 6 months before they put any real money into it... or maybe they shouldn't because if no one loses, then no one wins either.  ;)

Simple rule, if you can actually time a market, you wouldn't even consider asking about timing a market here.

Speculation itself isn't bad... short term speculation is bad.

Won't happen in one day.  At the worst look at the changes from month to month not minute to minute.

Are you asking what happens with the price stabilizes?  Some may try to cash out, but more people are going to be willing to use it as an actual currency rather than an investment.
