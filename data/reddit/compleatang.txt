Thanks. We will make some inquiries when we have the platform a bit more stable (and easier to use).

I'm not sure that is the exact problem set which Eris is attempting to solve. But please do feel free to give the code a spin and let us know if it  could work better for your purposes. The predominate problem set which Eris is attempting to solve is providing an underlying framework which people can easily adapt to their particular distributed needs. In particular, we are quite interested in exploring possible ways of looking at collective decision making so the platform is truly optimized for that. However everything is quite modular so those modules could potentially be adopted to whatever you would like to do with them. This is the beauty of open source!

That sounds interesting. We will check it out.

Mostly Eris is a backend system to be fair, but there is at least one screenshot on the repo:

Find us a city....! We'd love to work with an established governance system to improve the way they work with their citizens to deliver services. Indeed, that is my background -- doing legal and governance reform work in the international development context.

We are not trying to replace everything. We are simply exploring options for different ideas of communal interactions -- particularly with respect to collective decision making. To be fair, if you look at the commit history (now that the repos are open) you can see the differential between time spent on the code base and time spent on the paper which should show that there was a definite skew toward the code base at the expense of the paper.

Great question.
recent blogpost addresses part of your question head on. 
As to what information can be contained within Smart Contracts themselves, they have a nearly infinite storage system (2^256 X32bytes) which is part of the world state so can be accessed. with solidity this information is obfuscated and accessed primarily via `accessor` functions. data can be held in whatever form makes sense to the smart contractor designer.

Thanks Alan, that is a good idea. We are working to refine the presentation so we will try to add a defined terms section into the next version.

Thanks for your feedback. We are trying to clear up the paper. The original paper was meant for a specific purpose and a specific audience and we are looking at ways to revise it once the bounty phase has finished so that we can really get to work and hopefully have people interested in testing and using Eris.

The difference here, I think, centers around a distinction that must be made in contract litigation (as in current, prevailing legal theory of real world contracts). Most contract litigation centers around two questions. 
Question 1: Did a real world event happen and does it apply to this contract? Question 2: What does this contract mean. I call the former factual ambiguity and the latter textual ambiguity. 
Smart contracts, however we define them (see Preston's post for our -- admittedly made up and internally used definition) can only reduce litigation costs for textual ambiguity suits -- even then it will take a good amount of time to bring into mainstream commercial use. Factual ambiguity will remain fully in the domain of humans for quite a long time.

I agree. You have to have hash precision and linkage (which I call dual integration) between a particular script and a particular written contract. This is my best guess at how to slowly get courts into the mindset that they will even look at these things.
