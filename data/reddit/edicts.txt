What do you think will happen after it "pops" (assuming it will). Would it still be unsafe?

Then digital gift cards of any currency aren't real also.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:11:24
Exactly my feeling. Very unpopular opinion here.

A level headed poster during the crash? Heavens, no.
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:04:58
Do you mean that usually there aren't usually comebacks from a big bubble pop? Because BTC definitely came back from the last pop.

I'd anonymously buy a $100 gift card for my sister and her husband so that they can maybe lift themselves out of the junky financial situation they're in.

I need friends like this.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:13:39
Exactly. It's only as real as the worth given to it.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:21:56
Give it up. If you don't like it, go do something else. It means something to some people.

Not mine, but:
Did you hear about the stoner who got into Bitcoin mining? 
He was doing blocks of hash while hashing blocks, and blew what he mined on blowing his mind.

Is this just a beg thread? That's what it's turning out to be.

I'm just getting into bitcoin and to be honest, am pretty poor at the moment. I put in $50 worth when it was ~$550 but got scared when it hovered yesterday at ~$700 and pulled out. I want to stay in the market but... well this bubble possibility is scaring me. I also feel like the $1000 mark will be the next big pop for bitcoin.

I heard about bitcoin way back, didn't have any money to invest. I have some now, and finally decide to get into it, and boom. I could eat dirt right now.

I didn't know that the tips were worth bitcoin. I thought when you withdrew you got what you've been tipped in USD worth.
@_date: 2013-11-18 19:19:13
I tried to buy in. Everything is clogged up and anything that directly links your account takes days to verify. I'm sad. It would have been my first BTC purchase.
@_date: 2013-11-22 15:59:50
So do you believe it's not a bubble/it won't pop?
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:55:28
Yes. They do.
@_date: 2013-11-22 16:00:41
Are you saying that for the benefit of your account name or are you being serious?
@_date: 2013-12-06 17:57:26
Hate to sound condescending, but this belongs in @_date: 2013-11-22 13:34:13
Everybody on this subreddit adamantly states that this is NOT A BUBBLE. How is it not a bubble? Market trends have followed the same patterns throughout history. How is the bitcoin market any different?
@_date: 2013-11-22 14:15:44
I don't know. The insane increase over the last few months or so just doesn't look stable to me. I can't afford to lost much so I won't be making  any purchases soon. But I'll do that.
@_date: 2013-12-06 20:50:08
1% at the rate when it was at $921 is more than the rate when it is at $850... I don't know who's doing your math.
@_date: 2013-12-06 19:19:55
Honestly, that's what kinds of purchases keep them in business.
