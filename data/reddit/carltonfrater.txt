I own 0 bcash bud, I just know that everything i don’t agree with isn’t a scam

Ok maybe BSV is a scam, but ultimately you’re calling them scams because you don’t agree with the technical changes to the blockchain.

Bitcoin was meant to supplant the banks and traditional finance.  Of course traditional finance and traditional financial media are going to be anti-bitcoin

But most people who own bitcoin I’d say are millennials

I use Spend, which works like bitpay but is much cheaper, supports many crypto’s and has a “cash back” feature.

It means the ECB holds 25% of the EU’ debt.  The government is issuing debt and buying it, which can spiral out of control if left unchecked.

I’d try the Bisq exchange

More food trucks need to accept crypto.  A food truck near me accepts cards but at a 6-7% markup, and heavily prefers cash.  If that markup is due to not wanting to absorb visa/mastercard fees, crypto would make sense for them.
