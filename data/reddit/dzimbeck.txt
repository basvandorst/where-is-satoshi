It is open source. Its only that I will give out obfuscated source for building, bug checking and audits. No reason to give more until the market adopts the technology itself. After NightTrader is released the odds are I will open source it fully or at least put the obfuscated source on github.

No utitilty? Is this fud? We can start an employment contract in blackcoin where you have to perform. We can fund payments in milestones and be anonymous. We can start a small contract and microtrade under it. What cant be done with this? I even use multisignature joint accounts and two step sending and im adding cold staking

Here is the original Youtube video... BITHALO before black
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:43:40
In theory I can do this but the problem is, most daemon clients are coded poorly and cant support the features I need. They have very bad parsers and thus cannot get the balance of any wallet i query. Custom parsers must be made for said coins. Or I would have to code the parser from scratch. BitHalo uses electrum. BlackHalo uses a special daemon customized for pulling this off.

All me I was in Los Angeles in Pirates of the Carribean 2. Was a chess puzzle maker as a teenager. Then produced commercials and ran events. Etc... now I'm doing this because I want to make world economy better. You can leave and enter this system with very little. Take microtrading for example and guarantors. People can be guarantors and let people into the system with no deposit. They assume the risk and can build trust with strangers. Microtrading bridges can be make for only a few dollars enabling multimillion dollar transactions trustless without an exchange. For cash or commodity. Furthermore employment contracts can pay by the hour both sides with a very small deposit. If I pay you 15 an hour we can contract at deposits of 30. Thus every hour is a milestone. We can pay by the day or milestone under the same model. I could write a book on how many problems this can solve IF adopted.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:26:49
nope thats not true. Risk of default is always higher than reward of theft/neglect. Read the whitepaper. The real world applications for this are mindblowing. It actually has implications beyond the scope of bitcoin or blackcoin. 
You deposited into escrow and also deposited your coin. The wire is for 50% your total if you say you never recieved it you lose your coins. There is no escrow this is decentralized escrow. Escrow agents are 3rd parties and can collude to steal funds. This is trustless escrow.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:20:25
BitHalo was my first project I think Bitcoin is slow and insecure. Blackcoin has a useful maleability patch that is ideal for smart contracts. Nonetheless BitHalo exists as well its just I made so many alterations when coding BlackHalo that I will need to add a few thousand lines to BitHalo. BlackHalo is 7000 lines of code.
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:44:34
The title is a misnomer. Its a smart contracting and multisig client. Decentralized exchange is on a list of about 20 features and uses. Its not an alt its a client
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:42:02
Also I never released an Altcoin to avoid this exact kind of accusation.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:05:17
it existed for bitcoin first. Would you prefer thank escrow takes 1+ hours to confirm? I can do an escrow in under 5 minutes in blackcoin
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:06:01
Regardless, i have bithalo finished already however i added a lot on blackhalo so i will syncronize clients
@_date: 2014-07-05 12:26:55
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:21:47
so is your comment
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:22:45
well this is progress. Its an actually real world tool with limitless applications.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:18:35
Im the developer I can explain to you how it works if you email me however the source is very valuable as of right now. Im about 6 months ahead of my competition. Giving out my methods step by step is just a very bad idea. I made it for blackcoin because Bitcoin is too slow. In fact did you see my youtube video? I did an escrow using the software in bitcoin almost 2 months ago. But yeah you can read my whitepaper if you want i can explain better privately.
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:41:08
Mastercoin builds on bitcoin blockchain. My client is cross platform its not an alt. Its smart contracts that actually use bitcoin and other coins scripting systems correctly using signatures commitments and leverage risk and reward. Please read the whitepaper.
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:20:22
Maybe when they see BitHalo was finished 2 months ago they will realize I switched to alts because Bitcoin is so slow! Who wants to wait an hour for a contract? Did you try a contract in Halo yet? You can do one contract before a bitcoin confirmation! lol
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:15:24
code? Download it and find out. I can send you obfuscated source snippets if you like
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:34:53
I didnt take credit for anything. All I coded is a client. There is no reason to make open source in bold. Im aware I can open the source however the code is very valuable and will get instantly cloned if I do. Also I believe OB uses arbiters and that can have collusion. I did not create a decentralized marketplace I created an unbreakable contract and that has certainly not been around for decades.
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:49:19
Fiat is done because the program solves agreement. The contracts are unbreakable. Read the whitepaper. The code is 7000 lines long it is also obfuscated to protect it from alts. You are more than welcome to see the obfuscated code.
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:29:28
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:21:36
Comparison to what? There is nothing like this in the world. Download it and see for yourself. Also read the whitepaper. This is not an alt this is something i busted my ass for 6 months without food or sleep to make.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:33:01
This is not a pump I coded this if you like I can explain to you in depth how it works. :) In fact the first version was BitHalo but I saw Blackcoin speed and malleability patch and switched. You realize if i wanted a pump I would have started my own coin.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:23:25
This is not an altcoin. Download it. Its smart contracts. This is revolutionary software it has nothing to do with Blackcoin. I just chose Blackcoin because its fast and proof of stake 2.0 is more secure than peercoin. And it has a malleability patch.
@_date: 2014-08-08 08:02:24
Wanted to comment on the "open source" issue. I wanted to at first. And soon we will. Promise. However, we realized quickly most people just want to clone it. Somebody from Blackcoin even tried to reverse engineer it to start an altcoin. So to maintain the lead on the market. I'm waiting. In the meantime I'm willing to discuss the protocol, and even give out source with changed variable names to build from. There is a lot of scams and I definitely do not ask anyone to trust me. So instead send me a private message and I can send something to build from.
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:14:02
The project is already live. Its smart contracts I'm not sure what else to say. Would you like a site in black and white? I didnt even design the site it was given to me as a gift. I was too busy coding my smart contracting client.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:12:02
of course it can... im only one coder. I just made the first contracting client in the world. Dont you think a decentralized order book may take me another month to finish? For now there are irc floors which I would argue are immune to manipulation. You hold your fiat unless you want mtgox to hold it.
@_date: 2014-07-05 01:25:35
Yeah well i ported over to blackhalo months ago. The site was designed as a gift for me honestly I was coding from morning till night. He was getting the site done the BlackHalo site is up, NightTrader is up. It will be up. The code is not being released yet but I am willing to do an audit with any of the head bitcoin people. Like Gavin or Andreas. BitHalo is being delayed because I added a lot more features to BlackHalo. I couldn't code them simultaneously. Most likely I will do two coins within the same client since BitHalo uses electrum.
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:28:26
BitHalo you can microtrade. There is ways to eliminate risk of million dollar deals in halo using microtrading under deposit bridges. Thats described in the documentation ;)
@_date: 2014-07-04 20:33:24
Im not sure the comments below even deserve a response. Its decentralized two party escrow. I only worked for the past 6 months straight it was the most challenging this i have ever done. Just download the client and see for yourselves.
@_date: 2014-07-05 14:09:49
Its cross platform. It can run on any coin. Right now it exists for bitcoin and blackcoin
@_date: 2014-10-19 18:06:16
+1 for NightTrader
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:48:06
Yeah it does run on the blockchain. Its not an alt. It is Bitcoin and Blackcoin client. I would argue the most secure client available. Blackcoin client has cold staking where you dont even need both keys on the same computer making it unhackable. There is BitHalo but I think Blackcoin makes for faster contracts. Regardless BitHalo was completed 2 months ago and I made improvements for Blackcoin need to add those into Bitcoin I can release that at any moment.
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:38:51
Regardless I'm a fan of what you guys are doing and keep up the good work!
@_date: 2014-07-05 11:29:23
You can do fiat with a stranger even if you dont trust them. The contracts are unbreakable. The contracts are peer to peer there is not a third party. Also its smart contracts so it can construct any type of agreement. Its also multisignature for everything so there is joint accounts very high security etc.
@_date: 2014-07-06 06:57:57
Also the accusation that this is an alt is tremendously frustrating. It does not operate on top of a blockchain. It operates within it. Its just that Bitcoiners do not know how Bitcoin actually works. This program takes advantage of cryptography to create some amazingly beautiful commitments.
@_date: 2014-07-04 23:41:30
lol one of my threads got invaded by trolls.
@_date: 2014-07-06 14:51:21
Oh yeah anyone that implements watch only (they should take a look at blackcoind) and I will put them on the list. Once I open source I will release for every coin that gives this to me(within reason).
@_date: 2014-08-08 07:48:14
Hey this is David, the dev. Yeah I agree however people dont make changes to BTC anymore because its "too big to fail". Coins with a lower marketcap like BC are fork friendly. Honestly, I will open source however in order to make a big impact, its better to hold my position for now. Im not asking anyone to trust my source. However, I'm more than happy to send obfuscated python for you to build from. That way only the variable names are changed. :)
@_date: 2014-07-05 01:36:38
I mention trust building excercises because they apply when using guarantors or in zero risk loans. These are all possible in this program. And yeah he will behave rationally. My protocol limits communication. Read the documentation... he cant extort there is no way to actually contact the counterparty once in escrow unless they decide to in advance. They make arrangements before escrow. But it also depends on the deal. You can get highly creative with this.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:29:09
Developement???  This took me 6 months of solid work. I hardly didnt eat or sleep. Its over 7000 lines of code everything written from scratch. You are mistaken.
@_date: 2014-07-06 07:55:42
Download it on VM then and test with a small amount. PM me I am certainly willing to talk about it or even show some examples or walk you through how to do contracts.
@_date: 2014-07-04 22:31:26
My paper describes why this is not possible. Communication is usually filtered there is no way to contact the counter party unless it is constructive to the deal. Also you can perform trust building exercises. And you can perform microtrading. Smaller risk mulltiple transactions.
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:34:26
When you guys want to add it, let me know. Happy to hear you are open to it :D
@_date: 2014-10-22 19:32:34
You are not totally correct. Its just not on github for prying eyes. If anyone wants obfuscated python, I will let them build from it. And what a surprise... nobody wanted it. Because the majority of the market wants to clone the tech into their own coins with no regard for its actual security viability.
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:27:37
there is a time limit so thats not true. It also works with high dollar items. There is microtrading and equity can be sold in portions such as shares to a company or title to a house. That keeps the deposit low. For example, I'm selling 1 million dollars of Litecoin for Bitcoin. We create contract with 10,000 dollar deposits and send 5,000 at a time. Of course in Bitcoin we can perform this trade in a day and in Halo this is going to be automated.
@_date: 2014-07-10 19:41:10
What is this nonsense? BitHalo was being used two months ago! I did the first smart contract in BitHalo first but it was slow. So I did it for Blackcoin. Source will come out. I'm taking position. I will release open source when I decide that my market position is secure. You want to see the source? I would be happy to send it but I know this is FUD
@_date: 2014-10-28 02:32:37
You didnt read my whitepaper. First of all, in normal business deals, like an ebay sale the seller risks anyway without the deposit and there is incentive for theft. DDE removes that incentive. Thats the point. In high risk deals with new/unknown/untrustworthy parties, you can filter communication. If you notice in Halo, a deal can be made without giving out email address or phone number. Its just anonymous. There is a filtered messaging system that only allows things like time extension requests and sending of western union numbers things of that nature. Its impossible to make threats because the messages are filtered. Also, there is a time limit that blows up escrow you can set to whatever you want. Go into a 2 party escrow with me and try to extort I'm happy to be the guinea pig. But lets put up a Bitcoin and make it so you have to prove your point.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:18:23
Of course I can back it up. I've been developing for 4 years and made the worlds first multisignature wallet and smart contracts in BitHalo.
Lightning network does 2 of 2 accounts. Then it creates Pune Dryja channels in an asymetric way to make a HTLC to connect two unrelated 2 of 2 accounts.
So if Bob and Alice are in the 2 of 2
Alice is also in a 2 of 2 with Steve
If Steve owes money to Bob he create a HTLC with him so Bob may withdraw at any time. But if Alice is actually Steven she holds both keys and can withdraw effectively defaulting
If Alice is the one routing all payments owed to Bob it works fine. But Alice needs the physical funds in her account.
So using her as the intermediary between the two... it routes payments like such:
Steve owes Bob he routes HTLC to Alice who routes it to Bob
If Alice doesn't have the phyiscal funds in the 2 of 2 it won't work.
Therefore the proper architecture of a Lightning network is for EVERYONE to hold money with an extremely rich Bitcoin holder like a bank or winklevoss twins. Because they are the ones who can successfully route all of those payments P2P without clearing them.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:04:58
No its not because lighting networks are messy and centralized. Only rich holders would be able to be the 2 of 2 intermediary. Thats because of you use HTLC linked together without the live funds in the account that holds more, you have to either clear too many payments or have it held as an IOU. But if any funds are held that way there is a collusion risk and a hacking risk.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:22:40
With Segwit transactions will still lag on the miners end
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:52:23
There shouldn't be "one" coin. That goes against the principals of open source money in the first place. If you replace USD with BTC then BTC will be no different or WORSE. Its a fact that anything that the government touches they corrupt.
Using the media alone they can twist, pervert and manipulate just about everything. Using honey traps and positioning people with money and such. Its so fucking obvious to anyone with a brain that there is a huge power struggle in Bitcoin. Banks are totally positioning themselves. Anyone who thinks otherwise is extremely fucking NAIVE
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:19:52
I'm aware of segwit and it doesn't scale without lightning networks. Because the miners themselves need to make bigger blocks or transactions will be delayed for potentially hours or days.
@_date: 2017-03-19 16:12:27
Yeah right, sorry I didn't mean to argue from authority. The way you phrased it felt like the comment was directed at me. No hard feelings. It's okay either way. I've tried talking to core devs and posting here a few times. And unfortunately its like a train that cannot be derailed. So unfortunately only the self appointed core devs can do something to prevent it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:24:42
true, but the problem is also with the miners themselves who are dealing with small blocks. Unless there is some other reason for the delays of transactions by sometimes days?
Who is going to pay $1 in fees to buy a $1 coffee?
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:07:00
Regardless, the lightning network has serious security problems, leads to much greater centralization and is not ready yet etc
There needs to be a solution in the interim. You can say what you want but this is very much deliberate.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:36:09
Oh I don't? Shill
@_date: 2017-03-19 00:55:59
I'm the coder of BitHalo which was the worlds first multisignature software, the worlds first smart contracting software, first decentralized markets and still the only software that does smart contracting on Bitcoin. So don't accuse me of not understanding Bitcoin. I've forgotten more about Bitcoin in my 4 years of development writing 50,000 line custom software than you will ever know.
I'm aware of the technical issue intimately its just I don't kowtow to the media unlike other devs who seem to pretend to be running the place. Thats why I bring up technical discussion.
Its sad to see reddit also being centralized in as much as it is overrun by an army of non-techies (and potentially govt trolls).
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:22:39
Node should check online blockchain explorers.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:57:10
Yeah its possible there is a scalability method with Segwit for blocks that I'm not aware of. Can you or anyone explain how segwit supports scaling in a way other than lightning? Because all I hear about is lightning and think lighting is not secure. So I was curious if Segwit has other ways it can help miners generate bigger blocks or not.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:20:41
I don't give a fuck about BU. This is a security concern. Don't call me a shill i dont even like BU model. Preferably it would be nice to see core do something about it.
@_date: 2017-03-18 17:46:32
One of the potential solutions. The most dynamic that is immediately available anyways.
Slow blocks run higher security risk so it's in everyones best interest to implement something like bip100.
Downvote this post if you want. It would just be more proof that this reddit is also centralized. By an army that manipulates the public perception.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:32:04
Its already extremely centralized, Gavin controls the Github, the media already controls the major publishers like Coindesk. Not to mention people only listen to centralized media. Mining is naturally centralized, etc.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:32:04
I'm aware of how it works, I've been coding for over 4 years in Bitcoin. The blockchain is already too big for consumers. Its already centralized so may as well check online block explorers. In my software BitHalo thats what I do. If someone wants to run a full node, they will get the hardware to do it. Also hardware storage capacity will catch up quickly it almost already has.
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:09:59
Down-voting this post is a form of censorship by the way. Reducing reddit Karma deliberately to restrict unwanted queries. Bitcoin has always been centralized. It's just that the consumers don't want to believe it.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:55:23
Its not about if they are sane, its about the fact that they are easy to target and manipulate and the pool operators can manipulate the politics of forks as we are seeing. Thus if governments require more centralization miners will bend to their will. Gavin has met with CIA on multiple occasions. I'm not sure you should think he is totally clean. Plus people look up to people like that as leaders which makes the whole narrative easy to subvert.
Its not just about code, its about the beliefs of consumers. If you want decentralized, go to altcoins. It shouldn't be one coin anyways.
@_date: 2017-03-25 13:47:08
What ad hominem? You are wrong, I've been coding for 4 years exclusively in crypto. "clueless" is an ad hominem. This doesn't really have anything to do with the OP.
@_date: 2017-03-19 01:22:20
I'm not making an "argument from authority", I'm responding to and correcting your judgmental comment about me not understanding Bitcoin. Please don't argue for the sake of argument. I'm looking for enlightening conversation specifically from other coders. One I'm pretty sure I won't get here on reddit (I knew that before posting and thus should have refrained from doing so).
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:07:21
The miners can handle it. Its already centralized
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:03:07
I don't care about Bitcoin unlimited. Just telling the truth.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:26:19
I know how lightning works and if you read this thread you will see there is some security concerns with it due to collusion and hacking attacks. Very similar to a centralized exchange. The actual funds need to be in the accounts to route the debt properly which centralizes payments forcing everyone to account with extremely wealthy holders unless they plan on clearing payments constantly.
I agree lightning is a good solution, but it should not be done the way they are doing it. The network should be split into a liquid and frozen asset class so frozen assets can be used as collateral for routing debts so nobody can default and gain.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:30:51
BIP 100 lets miners vote on block size... but sure any dynamic solutions works. However BU will confuse consumers they should actually talk maturely with core about this bug.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:12:41
Thank you thats my point. Its just about being realistic and they had two years to solve this problem and created an artificial bubble and bottleneck and now its costing cosumers billions.
And if there is a "Bitcoin Unlimited" that is horrible for the Bitcoin brand and just confusing to consumers.
@_date: 2017-03-26 03:11:29
No actually I do think Lightning is part of the solution. Segwit is also not a completely bad way to scale blocks but it brings in new potentially risky security issues. So a block increase by voting in addition to Segwit is okay and should last us years. Also the fact is Bitcoin is already very centralized and people need to come to terms with that. The better hardware might really help support size of the chain. Also if they wanted things like Segwit to be more secure its possible they eventually can have two forms of liquidity. So liquid coins and frozen coins. That way users have something to use as collateral in long term lightning 2 of 2 accounts without forcing everyone to bank with the ultra-wealthy holders. Even so, thats a messy solution because LN has other things that make it impractical. For example, at the end of the contract there is a bit of game theory as you need to submit your transactions within a certain amount of time to make sure your disposable transactions don't lose out to one with a longer time lock.
@_date: 2017-03-25 05:23:45
I'm the coder of this
I've forgotten more about Bitcoin than you  will ever know. 50,000 lines of code and counting.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:39:57
LN is not secure... read the entire post I described why its more centralized and outlined multiple collusion attacks if they choose to account with people who aren't ultra-wealthy (either that or be constantly forced to clear payments or run the risk of holding IOUs)
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:05:29
A few people already control Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-03-18 18:05:23
In theory, a tiny number of people ARE controlling Bitcoin. And it is not the miners actually. They don't know from development, they can simply tell when serious security holes open up from lagging transaction volume.
It doesn't take a coder to understand the issue at this point... and I am a coder.
Just because people are silent doesn't mean they aren't the majority. The miners are definitely not the minority. Bitcoin Unlimited(the bastard child) "exists" because the Bitcoin core is not taking action. It is a result of their inaction. It shows how people cry out against centralized control of the code.
Everyone wants them to take action, it's just that many people don't speak out about it. The github is centralized, bitcoin.org is centralized and so is the media.
Bitcoin is proving to become like "fiat"
altcoins are proving to be the new Bitcoin.
I'm not a big fan of Bitcoin unlimited. Notice my post. I'm interested in seeing the core team face the one bug on their github that matters most right now.
@_date: 2017-03-25 03:23:36
you forgot governments to add to that list. And core devs on githubs and centralized mining pools.
@_date: 2019-11-26 11:42:53
You brute force adding words you know to the dictionary. If you know the Bitcoin address it's much easier because you only need to know the algorithm used on the site to generate the wallet then generate using that same algo in c++ so it's fast. I've done this before for people who have forgotten passwords. Basically, just take what you remember about the password and hopefully you remember which parts were upper and lower case then you can determine how many things you forgot. If you forgot less than 6 letter permutations it's easy to reconstruct. Also see if the site changed algorithm for generating the brain wallet in the past few years. Also compare the regular and compressed account based on the code on the site.
@_date: 2017-01-31 08:48:12
Ungrateful? They didn't code Bitcoin. They are self appointed, and the core needs to work together on changes and if they can't it is their own fault. There is tens of thousands of Bitcoin users that would back me up on this. The development moves at a snails pace and it shows by the 40,000 unconfirmed transactions. It's only going to get worse the more Bitcoin grows. They are not immune to criticism. Nobody is.
@_date: 2017-01-31 08:51:49
No you are not understanding the attack. A 2 of 2 multisig is being connected to another 2 of 2 multisig. If Alice is owed money from the Poon-Dryja channel, the lightning channel can collude with itself and default. If Alice hacks the key to the channel she can default on her IOUs to Bob. This is why the lightning channel not as secure as its hyped up to be. I work with multisig for over 4 years and coded over 40,000 lines in BitHalo. This is a very obvious and overlooked problem with these channels. It was almost an identical design to a multisignature exchange I was thinking of coding years ago.
Of course Alice and Bob can't get hacked but they can default on what they OWE if they hack the lightning signing key associated with their account.
In short if Bob is owed from Alice, Alice only needs to obtain her other key to double spend and default on Bob making the whole point of timelocks irrelevant.
@_date: 2017-01-31 13:06:23
You are welcome. It works perfectly as long as each channel doesn't promise to link transactions from another account. In other words, large clearing houses are the problem, not Segwit. Every 2 of 2 needs to have those Bitcoins in the account. Once money starts to be owed then it becomes a problem. If there was a way to route IOUs and only then would it be as fast as they promise. You can route an IOU with this design, but that would be very similar to the risk you take with an exchange, and you should cash those IOUs as soon as possible to get the money in your 2 of 2. Otherwise people will still have to wait 10 minutes to a few hours for their Bitcoins to confirm to top off their joint accounts.
@_date: 2017-01-31 12:46:03
There are IOUs if two channels are linked by being chained together with hash time locked contracts. 
Just because a word is not used in the paper doesn't mean that IOU does not fit the definition of chained accounts that route debt.
This is a risk, known or not. You can't link accounts unless there is sufficient collateral in both to prevent default.
Because in theory it is possible to create many linked channels where hash time locked contracts are linked by a central hub aka a "Mt Box" which doesn't hold any collateral.
This conversation is getting frustrating. Honestly you don't understand the architecture.
It is a SERIOUS problem for Alice and Bob if their contracts are linked like this:
Bob-Lightning (if he hacks lightning he has 100% of his account and can default on any HTLC)
Since whatever Bob OWES Alice can be defaulted on unless lightning hub has enough collateral to cover Bobs default. One of two things happen there either Lightning node loses money or Alice loses money and it depends entirely on how much collateral Lightning node had invested with Alice(in their 2 of 2 account).
I'm going to stop responding until you fully understand the paper and the logic behind this risk.

I will make this very clear. There is multiple different architectures proposed for lightning.
If Bob+Lightning have a 2 of 2 and Bob puts up 3 BTC and Lightning puts up 10 BTC then the MOST Bob can receive from the channel is 10 BTC.
If the lightning network "links" money from another account they hold (lets say with Alice) using HTLC then those payments are meaningless to Bob. He would need that money to be funded into his 2 of 2 account before accepting the payment.
If for example you have a clearing house (a Mt Box) and it decides not to put anything in the 2 of 2 and Bob holds an account like so:
Bob(3 BTC deposited) -&gt; Lightning(0 BTC deposited)
Then all Bob can do is send money "off the chain" he cannot receive anything. If he was to receive, those would have to be broadcasted to the network.
I'm not saying lightning doesn't work, I'm saying the "Mt Box" scenario does not.
The lightning will reduce the amount of transactions reported to the chain, it just won't eliminate it. It is best that most people find someone with a lot of Bitcoins to pair with so they can channel a lot of transactions. In many cases, it will still take 10 minutes for Bitcoins to confirm and transactions will need to be broadcasted all the time to mitigate that risk.

Alice-Bob works if they can't hack each other
Alice-Bob routing debt from Bob-Frank does not work unless Bob has enough collateral to cover all IOUs in case of default.
because Bob could be Frank
and thus default on whatever is owed to Alice beyond what is in his joint account with her

They certainly do, however some of the changes should have been made a long time ago. There is only so many devs with github access who have prevented a lot of really important security fixes. And they debate and BLOCK trivial changes that would help patch the growing pains Bitcoin is experiencing.
I'm not ungrateful by the way. I've been coding in Bitcoin for over 4 years. Some of their fixes are quite good. Regardless, this is completely true.
This is why altcoins have been developing new ideas at a blinding pace. Granted I think creating a coin like Ethereum that was obviously insecure is too fast and was not responsibly tested which resulted in people losing a lot of money. However the development can't be too fast or too slow. They should not prevent each other from contributing or fall into a stalemate. Any stalemate is evidence that it is not decentralized.
@_date: 2017-01-31 11:56:04
Bob is issued IOUs. You don't need to link the paper. I'm aware of how it works. It depends on how the debt is routed. People can default on debts. Even if a very wealthy holder of Bitcoin wanted to be in a joint account with multiple parties he would have to clear coins very frequently so he isn't routing too many IOUs.
Of course Bob can't lose the funds in his joint account. But he absolutely can be defaulted on if he is owed money that is not in his joint account due to collusion.
Yes they are "real" transactions and they are time locked and replaced with disposable keys. However those contracts are meaningless if the person who owes the debt gets access to the other key in their joint account.
To simplify the argument: Bob has 50% of his Poon-Dryja account, Alice has 100% of her Poon-Dryja account(she is spoofing or she has hacked her other key to obtain more than 50% control of her account). Bob can't trust IOUs issued by Alice because she can double spend.
Thus all channeled payments need to be directly connected in 2 of 2 accounts to work. Period. And there must be sufficient deposits to cover all IOUs. Otherwise its just the illusion of safety.
In other words a channel Bob-&gt;Alice routing debt through Alice-&gt;John  routing debut through John-&gt;Joe
Bob can only trust payments Alice makes in their joint account with whatever is deposited. He cannot trust new money routed from Joe to himself because at any point there could be collusion.
I thought "Lightning Signing key" would be clear what I was referring to. Its the key of any giant debt routing server aka a "Mt. Box" 
There is no way to my knowledge to make the 2nd signature of a 2 of 2 multisig autonomous and unhackable.

It's been around for 5 years, it's not a scam it's open source software. You can build from source if you want. It had smart contracts before Ethereum. There aren't any fees and there is no escrow. Your comment is worthless. Do some research.
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:42:36
Because there is no escrow agent. Bob and Alice put funds in a 2 of 2 joint account. For example, Bob puts up 2 BTC to sell the Bitcoin Alice puts up 1 BTC to avoid extortion and guarantee sending. If Alice sends an empty envelope then Bob will not release her funds and she will lose 1 BTC and Bob will pay to lose 2 unless Alice agrees to cancel. If Bob tries stealing the envelope he loses 1 BTC because he paid 2. He must release her deposit. Lying is impossible because there is nobody to lie to except your intended victim. This has been around 5 years and never has a contract been lost. Both parties win together or they lose together. They determine if they feel cheated or lied to. In a dispute the only ones who know the truth is the victim, aggressor and perhaps their divine creator. This software does to law what Bitcoin did to money. Weather or not people realize this is not material to that fact.
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:45:12
No the funds are burned. It's possible to destroy Bitcoins and that's what this software will do if they don't agree. They can however choose for time extensions and if there was more users we could even checklocktimeverify in case a party disappears. The bomb is always submitted by the client itself upon expiry.
@_date: 2019-06-08 21:40:57
Thats why there is also a reputation system their deposit would be increased by others because they can see it on the blockchain. So not only do they end up more poor but they will increasingly be required to deposit higher.
@_date: 2019-06-11 09:35:42
But you don't profit from the exit scam. You blow up your own money if you try to steal. Your counter-party will blow up both your money. So nobody would do something so stupid.
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:08:32
They don't have to they have a deposit. So stealing it is not an option. If you sent 1k in the mail recipient can't steal it because they would have 2k in BTC in double deposit. You would also have 1k in the contract. They either both lose or both win. Who is scamming whom? How do they profit. Ignorance is pretty common to revolutionary ideas. But if you think it's a scam, go into a contract with me and try to scam me. Heck I would put 3x your deposit. There is no escrow. Only buyer and seller in joint account. So no middle man, no arbiter, no judge. Get it?
@_date: 2019-06-08 21:40:15
Then the recipient loses $10. They are buying the $5 in BTC thus there is $10 on their behalf in the contract ($5 in advance and $5 in deposit). The person sending would get angry and blow up the contract and they both lose $5(since sender also put small $5 deposit). Theft is literally impossible in this contract.
@_date: 2019-06-13 06:46:59
I would put up double your funds. This project has existed for 5 years. BitBay has run 1000s of contracts alone. Why is it so hard to accept that something so amazing exists. Get over your pride and shilling and understand it.
If you put a deposit of 2 BTC and I put a deposit of 1 BTC I can't back out because we lose 3 BTC collectively if escrow blows up. And if I send you cash, and you steal it. You would blow up 2 BTC of your own funds to steal 1 BTC worth of cash. It's stupid and impossible to steal on these because there is no escrow, the victim will not sign off on it. Again, I will happily put up double whatever you put up and prove to you that if you attempt to not honor your word we will both lose money. I'm a highly renowned dev why are we having this conversation. Meanwhile central exchanges steal billions and you are here picking on one of the safest escrows in the world.
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:49:03
You sound like an angsty teen lol. I've coded over 100k lines and this is the thanks I get? I've also coded the decentralized peg in BitBay and the worlds first decentralized markets in 2015. Also the markets on BitHalo are decentralized. The reason you don't hear about it is because I don't prostitute or market. Just blood, sweat, tears. Hard work, code. Code is law, it speaks for itself. I eventually was hired to move to bitbay.market so I put a lot of my promotion of BitHalo on the back burner as well. Although it still runs flawlessly and I've used it myself as a multisignature client for my own personal Bitcoins over any other client. It would be nice to have a web version of Halo but I was busy working in the decentralized peg last year. Then I burned out because the industry is too greedy and censorship. As for contracts, BitBay has run endless contracts over the past 4 years with flawlessly
@_date: 2019-06-17 09:07:25
You are comparing it to Paypal? On Paypal tons of people had problems, transactions of large sizes were constantly reversed screwing people out of Bitcoins. This software prevents theft and deception something rampant in society. But if you are happy with society the way it is then that's your problem. Just consider that people like myself who prefer to keep others honest will use it despite the sheep who line up to be slaughtered over and over again by 3rd party escrow and exchanges. This is a tool made to save some of them weather or not they choose to use it.
@_date: 2019-06-08 09:55:21
Yeah add BitHalo. Was the worlds first smart contracts before Ethereum. Active since early 2014. Double deposit escrow. No middle men. Either no KYC or users do it themselves because there is literally no owner as markets are decentralized as well. Also free to use.
@_date: 2019-06-08 05:05:28
Deposits are customizable. I've done contracts usually deposits are 1:1. So like if a seller wants to sell 1 BTC he usually puts up the Bitcoin and a deposit and the buyer also puts up a Bitcoin so funds aren't held hostage. The thing is they don't have to close the contract, they can microtrade up to millions of dollars incrementally. So like Bob puts up 2 BTC, Alice 1 BTC. Alice sends cash, Bob can't steal or else they both lose. So they clear escrow because the only choice is working together. There is a reputation system in it as well so known users can lower deposits. But personally I feel more secure at 1:1. This has been around more than 5 years. It's just that it's not marketed heavily because there are no fees to use it.
@_date: 2019-06-08 21:41:55
Ahh it goes to Bitcoin eater address. 1BitcoinEaterAddressDontSendf59kuE
Thats because I coded it in early 2014 before 6a existed. I can switch to 6a just haven't had the need to. And besides the Bitcoin eater is easier to track for reputation purposes
@_date: 2019-06-08 21:30:29
There are guarantor contracts that let only one party deposit to build trust with the other. Also there is a reputation system. Once a buyer has a little bit of Bitcoin even a marginal amount the seller would be able to enter the contract with almost no risk.
@_date: 2019-06-18 21:49:21
I think it's especially useful for very high risk deals like million dollar OTC deals and international shipping deals.
@_date: 2019-06-16 06:33:42
Compare to not having deposits. People can simply steal and that's what they do. Onion has like 90% scam sites because of theft and escrow collusion. People only spite when they are very desperate and that will leave them very poor. You are comparing theft which is so rampant it's ridiculous to something that will happen .001% of the time. We have never seen an escrow blow up for the reasons you mention. In fact, none have ever blown up except during tests. The equivalent is to lighting your own money on fire. The odds are absurdly low. And it's far superior to how business is conducted today. They say you can lead a horse to water...
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:12:13
In other words, I'm saying if everyone doesn't bank with the ultra wealthy, then the Lightning network is totally useless, will not prevent bloat and My Box will totally centralize Bitcoin even more. The shills like it because most of them are government shills subverting the decentralized ideology. The only potential patch is if you had frozen and liquid fund asset classes so people have reserve funds to make daisy chained 2 of 2 making a little bit less of a centralized model. But still centralized! (who would want a 2 of 2 with someone who can't route a ton of money to them?!)
@_date: 2017-04-27 03:05:03
Dude I have made zero mistakes. Don't get pompous with me.  I've been working on BitHalo for 4 years it was the worlds first multisig software and the contracts are ALL 2 of 2 double deposit escrow. I've forgotten more about P2SH than most Bitcoin devs know. (you are confused you seem to think I said they can collude on live funds. They can only collude on IOUs. But there is the problem it creates because when you aren't trusting Mt Box you are limited in how much you can route by your counterparty.)
Read what I said very carefully.
There is nothing wrong with LN by design. The problem is with centralized Mt. Box payment hubs. The REASON for the HTLC is to LINK 2 unrelated 2 of 2 accounts.
I've posted multiple examples on here already, please read them.
Here it is again.
Hypothetical example:
Bob has a 2 of 2 with Alice
he holds 10 btc and she holds 5 btc (for example)
Jane has 2 of 2 with Joe.
Jane holds 3 btc Joe holds 5 btc
If Bob wants to pay Jane 2 btc WITHOUT broadcasting to the chain, he can't. Because Jane needs to TRUST that Bob is not Alice.
THUS the only way this works at all is if Alice holds a 2 of 2 with Jane.
So Alice is in 2 of 2 with Jane
Alice has 1 btc Jane has 2
Thus Bob can microtrade the contracts to Alice in his 2 of 2 with her up to 2 BTC thats fine as Jane will confirm Alice is routing the payments to her!
Except there is a problem. Alice only has 1 btc with Jane.
So she either writes an IOU or only routes 1 btc they can clear the other on the chain.
That doesn't really reduce bloat because Bob could pay direct anyways since the balance is not high enough.
So if its an IOU thats insecure because again, Jane cannot guarantee that Bob is not Alice leaving her short 1 BTC!!!
Horrible. Absolutely horrible.
So the ONLY serious way to do this is that everyone holds with ULTRA wealthy holders like banks or Mt. Box.
Otherwise payments would constantly need to be cleared all the damn time and people would bank with ultra-wealthy anyways.
So the solution is highly centralized.
Bob holds 10 btc with Mt Box who is Winklevoss twins and they hold in this account 10,000 BTC
Alice and John and Steven and 100 other people bank with the Winklevossessesses (plural of Winklevoss). NOW it works because the money can in fact be routed off chain because the Mt. Box physically holds the funds!
But beware, you need to store potentially 100s of microtransactions in addition to your keys on your computer. If Mt. Box experiences data loss and you don't back that up??? THEN Checklocktimeverify can be gamed to get the money back and default on payments. (since the idea is if you clear early they can publish the disposable private key and clear a different amount beating you to the punch)
Seriously this is not a safe network. At all. I'm not even going to get into the exploits of the game theory itself, the fact that consumers won't even be holding critical data and this will force everything back into the hands of governments. Your opinion on this matter is irrelevant weather or not you recognize the undeniable truth.
@_date: 2017-04-28 23:29:05
Actually an IOU of course can exist on lighting assuming both parties trust Mt. Box. I didn't invent the word "IOU" lol, you obviously knew what I meant. My point was that people would eventually trust HTLC contracts. So like when Bob and Alice bank with Mt Box. and Mt. Box can't cover the funds because they are simply out of capital... to route the payment they might be "okay" with assuming that Mt. Box is not also Bob/Alice and Bob. That can set a sort of dangerous "trusted" pretext which can lead to potential hacking of the Mt. Box key and loss to the parties involved. I'm thinking of where things are going, not where they are currently. Currently there is NO lightning network created that people use. The situation where there is no capital could be all too common among "smaller" Mt. Boxes who aren't as wealthy.
Okay so if your position is the SAME. Then we agree. And this is the point I have made in this post! So I'm happy you do actually agree with this. It's sad that things are headed this way where these centralization concerns aren't even being addressed at all. Under the veil of hype, the consumers will not listen to reason here.
And sorry if I communicated my position in a way that was confusing to you (everyone has a different way of expressing themselves and of understanding the insinuations).
@_date: 2017-04-26 02:34:02
The flaw is serious though because if Mt Box isn't routing IOUs and only operating with live funds then they themselves MUST have those funds available. This is extremely simple. Regardless of how fancy you have a 2 of 2 account. If there are two accounts that are 2 of 2 linked then one of them can collude unless their joint partner in common has the key.
Thus, you either bank with the ultra-ultra wealthy or constantly clear payments once they exceed what you can route. If you are constantly clearing payments then the lighting network loses all its effect in scaling.
Otherwise the only way to set it up is with things I know Bitcoin will never implement for example crawling pegs with frozen and liquid with variable liquidity that could potentially be used as deposits giving more people access to ways of routing IOUs that have some sort of backing.
This isn't a trivial problem and people who think it is have not wrapped their mind around it.
Think simple. A 2 of 2 can actually be Mt Box pretending to be counter-party thus holding both keys. Thus any HLTC that exceed the balance in common with either party of this said 2 of 2 cannot be trusted since the money simply must be there to cover if they attempt double spend. (remember nothing is broadcast to blockchain in LN you must GUARANTEE the money is there).

@_date: 2017-06-02 23:41:11
That wasn't my point. Where did I recommend bigger blocks? I pointed out lightning networks is centralized for that matter so is mining. And technically bigger blocks would reduce fees because it would reduce competition for getting into a block and the necessity for miners to charge so much. It was just odd to me that my post got downvoted as if something self-evident such as Bitcoins slowness is immune to criticism. Which is why I hardly ever post on Bitcoin reddit.

Such a politicized thread. Are we so sure that we aren't replacing a bank with a bank?
@_date: 2017-06-02 21:02:26
Even if thats true, who cares? This technology fuels lots of projects, its open source. Why shouldn't people start their own coins. You can do market pegs so they aren't devalued and if something becomes more popular than Bitcoin great. There is a more serious problem that Bitcoin might eventually centralize because lightning network will force people to hold accounts with the ultra-wealthy so they can properly clear payments p2p. Also its worth mentioning mining is very centralized by nature with mining pools so in my opinion a superior method is called for. At least altcoins experiment with ideas that are not as wasteful. The worlds largest supercomputer producing useless hashes instead of contributing the mining power to solve world problems.
