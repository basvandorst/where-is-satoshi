Yes, exactly. Its almost as if "money" on a conceptual level is fundamentally, no different from any religion/belief system. I like to think of myself as an "atheist"... but I think bitcoin's strength is in its fundamentals. And for the first time, it's alluring me in ways that no other religion has ever successfully "got me".

In the best case scenario, we could build an entirely new government based on voluntary participation and crypto/blockchain.
We can still choose to live in a society of taxation and public goods, and we can do it separately from the current traditional power structures that operate today solely by extorting all citizens through taxation based on "mandatory national identity" and using those funds for cronyism, imperialism, and a bunch of other evil shit.

It was more unbelievable to ever think bitcoin would be $1,000 or $10,000.
Considering the rules for future supply to be mined by the halving schedule, exponentially expensive bitcoin does not sound farfetched at all. 
To me, it seems like higher prices will be inevitable. Either that, or bitcoin fails entirely. I do not see anything in the middle.
The question is not "if", but "when".
@_date: 2019-07-25 03:13:18
When you say $150 million, is that equivalent to 2019's buying power of $150 million?

Generally, yes. Ive gone down enough youtube rabbit holes and reddit discussions lol.
But, that doesn't mean that most humans will "wake up" to the systemic problems of todays power and money systems.
Time and time again through history, it seems more likely that people in their respective societies just follow along lines of the status quo culture, even when it is against their own interest.
Mass adoption of bitcoin seems like a difficult task since the "need" isn't so obvious to average joe.
It takes someone who is more ideologically primed to understand bitcoins value proposition. And those kinds of people are willing to figure out the learning curve to participate.

Hype can happen again.
If there is anything that bitcoin has shown time and time again, is that hysteria can happen, the bulls can roll into town, and it's not predictable by any truly tangible measures.
I cannot make any predictions for specifics, but if "history repeats", then there will be more bull runs fueled by hype, likely followed by more bear trends.

Bitcoin is only 10 years old, so its fair to have skepticism. If you have an open mind to it and really take the time to learn/understand how bitcoin works and the value proposition of it, you may find value in it yourself.
Bitcoin is the hardest money humans have ever seen. Bitcoin is even harder than gold, since bitcoin has a truly finite supply and a mining schedule that is fully transparent/visible. Bitcoin has superhero qualities that gold can never have, most notably (IMO) in regards to divisibility and transportability.
Bitcoin is valuable because it's a scarce asset that operates on a decentralized, distributed, trustless system where you can transact value with anyone, anytime, anywhere.
If the bitcoin network is ever fundamentally attacked/hacked/compromised then the entire value proposition will become worthless, so thats essentially the entire "gamble" that people are speculating on.
So far, bitcoin has survived its 10 year infancy and has been "battle tested" through ongoing attempts to destroy and/or manipulate it by many many many adversaries.
If bitcoin keeps living on, as it currently is, remaining fundamentally unharmed... it is inevitable that it will continue to absorb monetary value into it like a financial black hole, as more and more people will understand it, trust it and adopt it.
Scarcity is fundamentally built into bitcoin, so higher value over time is simply a function of supply and demand as more people adopt it.
In short, the value of bitcoin will be either 2 things: Continuously more valuable on a long term chart or zero.
In my view, since bitcoin has survived its infancy of 10 years, it has spread far and wide enough that it is literally not feasible to be stopped or destroyed.

You go with your gut instinct. No one can reliably predict or guarantee the highs or the lows to trade perfectly.

Ultimately, this is all sort of irrelevant. People are holding bitcoin regardless of these predications. These time traveler fantasies are just for fun. If we somehow hit 100k in December... well... things will have definitely gotten very interesting.
Anyways, bitcoins fundamentals and stock to flow are enough reason to hold long term, regardless of supposed time traveller prophecies.

You don’t get it. Bitcoin halves every 4 years. Bitcoin is more scarce as more time passes. Bitcoin will perpetually be more valuable.
Think of bitcoin as a long term savings account vehicle.
Think like a trader and you will statistically lose your precious profits. 
Trade some out when you feel comfortable with some gains in the hope to buy in more later, but you take the risk of trading against your own best interest.

I never stopped buying. So you are technically correct.
@_date: 2019-06-13 04:46:37
It's secure money with a finite supply. Price increase is simply a function of supply, demand, and deflation. My suspicion is that the price will "fully mature" when the total supply of bitcoin is mined. IMO, bitcoins network security is the only benchmark needed for its continued success. So, granted that the bitcoin protocol/network remains secure, then Bitcoin will continue to become more valuable over time until it reaches full maturity. Once maturity is reached, bitcoin's value/purchasing power will become "stable" and will no longer be seen as a speculative investment that will "yield returns". At that time, bitcoin will simply be seen as secure money without inflation.
If bitcoins security is breached, then the entire value proposition of bitcoin becomes worthless. 
If that ever happens, maybe a different coin with "greater security" will take over bitcoins role.
Final thoughts: Assuming bitcoin remains secure, be grateful to be an early adopter to the most ultimate "investment opportunity" the world has ever seen. We are still very early.

Bitcoin is secure money with a finite supply. Price increase and volatility is simply a function of supply, demand, and deflation.
My suspicion is that the price will "fully mature" when the total supply of bitcoin is mined and at that point, most of the global population has "converted" some or all of their monetary wealth into bitcoin. (That is year 2140, so very far from now).
IMO, bitcoins network security and decentralization are the primary benchmarks truly needed for its continued success. Scaling will be improved along the way.
So, granted that the bitcoin protocol/network remains secure, then Bitcoin will continue to become more valuable over time until it reaches full maturity. Once maturity is reached, bitcoin's value/purchasing power will become "stable" and will no longer be seen as a speculative investment that will "yield returns". At that time, bitcoin will simply be seen as secure money without inflation and the scaling solutions for Bitcoin core will have already been well figured out.
If bitcoins security is breached, then the entire value proposition of bitcoin becomes worthless.
If that ever happens, maybe a different coin with "greater security" will take over bitcoins role.
Final thoughts: Assuming bitcoin remains secure, be grateful to be an early adopter to the most ultimate "investment opportunity" the world has ever seen. We are still very early. Bitcoin will probably stabilize in or after year 2140.

It would probably be considered profits taxed as short term gains. Consult an accountant.
@_date: 2019-12-08 01:54:23
Best to consult a pro... but it should start the initial date of purchase. Ideally you will have a record/history from the exchange/platform you purchased from. If you bought privately, then the date of your transaction via the blockchain would be your record, etc.

Another question to ask is: “how was your seed generated?”
Generating a seed from a hardware wallet is going to be more secure (for most people).
Then after, you can wipe your hardware device and have the seed written down separately of the device.

Hardware wallets are small money compared to mining rigs.
@_date: 2019-09-26 00:28:55
In short, the amount of bitcoin mined gets cut in half approximately every 4 years. A bitcoin block is mined about every 10 minutes, which is rewarded to the “winning” miner of that particular block. 
The amount of bitcoin mined per block is the same, until 4 years, it will be cut in half, and half again in another 4 years, and so on. This happens for the life of bitcoin, until it reaches full maturity which is projected to happen in year 2140 at the cap of 21 million bitcoin.

Nope, not according to what I’ve seen. Magnotta and old negotiation are predicting 100k end of 2019. Charts never lie 4chan guy isn’t as bullish for the short term, but still bullish overall.
