To buy stocks, bonds, ETFs, real estate and other investment vehicles to protect their wealth in the long run.
Tell me, why are you guys so focused on the BTC to USD exchange rate if you don't care that much about USD?

Yet he's not buying BTC but investing in companies building technologies around it, precisely what my point is.
What people do is more relevant than what they say.

Well, that's not quite how financial risk works.
What you say is true when you're holding a portfolio on the efficient frontier. At that point, you can only increase your expected return by increasing your risk.
This Neo &amp; Bee scam was a shitty deal that no reasonable investor should have touched. Which is precisely what happened: no reasonable investor touched that shit with a 10 foot pole, only bitcoiners with no knowledge of investment or the business world.

The link is one of the main message board where Wall Street investment bankers and traders hang out.
As you can see, they're clearly thrilled about Bitcoin and don't think of it as a joke.
Quotes of choice:
"bitcoin fanboys on reddit are going bonkers. it's pretty hilarious."
"Bitcoin is now around $186 off its intraday high of $266. Hilarious"
"No one wants to have their wealth denominated in a currency whose purchasing power can fluctuate &gt;30% in a matter of hours. Goodbye, Bitcoin."
"To me, this thing is over. The volatility is absurd for something that claims to be a store of wealth."
"Also, some goofball who obviously owns them for pennies was giving them away on Reddit earlier today.You gotta love how bizarre this whole subset of humanity is."

"Olaf attended Vassar College where he received a **BA in sociology** and wrote his thesis on Bitcoin. He is an avid writer, **expert in cryptography** [...]"
See, they have cryptography experts working for them!
This is Bitcoin, it's serious business.

The problem is that you typically need an awful lot of due diligence and regulations to protect investors. So you'll still need exchanges, audit firms, etc. This fundamental problem won't go away.
So I don't quite see how Bitcoin would democratize investment more than online brokers like E*Trade do.

In developed countries with an inflation targeting monetary policy (with a target of 1 to 3%), inflation is pretty much irrelevant to business and investment decisions.
Actually, Bitcoin isn't the only alternative. We could simply decide to have a 0% inflation target instead of a 2% or 3% target.

Oh, no, he's not delusional.
He's a venture capitalist at one of the largest VC firm, and I'm pretty sure he knows what he's doing.
But you have to look at what he does, not just what he says.
He's investing in Bitcoin ventures, and most likely doing all this stuff in USD. He's neither buying bitcoins nor trying to earn bitcoins.
So now he's looking to cash his investments out. That's the only thing VCs do: get into something early, promote (and grow) the hell out of it and sell it to a large company (or do an IPO).
Therefore the grand claims that bitcoin is a revolution and bla bla bla.

Up up up then down down down  
I layer the book to earn the spread  
Up up up then down down down  
It's illegal but I don't care  
Up up up then down down down  
No regulation to stop me down!

This has literally nothing to do with Bitcoin or inflation.
Short-termism is because companies report every quarter and CEOs have relatively short tenure periods, so they have a tendency to optimize for the short run.

That was a joke.
Although the Internet was mostly funded by the US government, and Al Gore was one of the people pushing for it. But he obviously didn't invent the technology behind it.

I'm what you would consider a Bitcoin 'troll'.
I might adopt Bitcoin, or a derived protocol, in the future, when the technology becomes more transparent to the user.
This doesn't mean I'm going to 'invest' by buying the tokens used to make those transactions work. It's like investing in the retail industry by hoarding the plastic tokens you put in shopping carts.
If I were to invest in Bitcoin (which I'm not), I would buy shares of companies doing work in the crypto-currency area.

None. The Internet was created by US government agencies and universities. It was a trusted network (and had very poor security because of that).
The fraud came after that.

Bartender: 0.011 BTC  
Patron: OK, here's 0.011 BTC  
Bartender: Hey, wait, you only gave me 0.011!  
Patron: Well, isn't that the price?  
Bartender: Hmm, no it's 0.013 BTC now

When you hold stocks in the evil, statist-supported, regulated stock market, as an investor you have to bear some risk: maybe the products won't sell well, maybe the R&amp;D efforts won't lead to anything, and so on.
Usually, though, the fact that the CEO can run away with the company's assets is not considered a business risk. It is actually considered a serious crime by those close-minded statist shills.

Invest the money in any safe investment (i.e. not anything Bitcoin related) with a moderate yield (5%) and you can spend the rest of your life with 300,000 USD income per year on some unsuspecting island.
The guy doesn't care about not being able to do anything in business since he's not qualified to run a business anyway, so he doesn't have that option in the first place.

It doesn't matter because in a diversified portfolio you reduce default risk to end up with only systematic risk.
