I just got a similar letter for around $200, annoying but probably not worth the hassle to get it back

Could add  as well, though recently it's been hard to buy since they're sold out so often.

Bitcoin is not a stock and doesn't behave like one.
As an investment it's mostly speculative and doesn't behave like most sound investments. So no, it's not a good place to start for teaching your son about stocks and investments.

Yes that works just fine

Too bad they don't accept Bitcoin...

Same here, though not that much. Hopefully just lagging

Say I'm selling an apple for $1
But then two of my friends say they want to buy an apple.
I'd be smart to sell to one of them at a higher price, like $1.50.
Conversely, if 5 more people come along and want to sell an apple, my two friends would be smart to bargain the price down, say to $.25
Basic supply and demand

Companies reinvest their profits to increase the value of the company (R&amp;D on new ipads or whatever brings in even higher profits later). If the value of the company goes up, stockholders are holding stocks which should be considered more valuable =&gt; price of the stock goes up. A company that gives away all of its profits in dividends will never grow. The link I gave doesn't explain this, my apologies.
In your example, you have to give away the bitcoin to buy something, just like you had to give away a stock to exchange for another good.
