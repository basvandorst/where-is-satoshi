That is EXACTLY the case !  
We traveled 6 miles[10km] so that we can take photos of ourselves using it.   
My other two friends that came along with me both got something, but when it is my turn...THIS!    
Why do you hate me ?!!!
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:50:26
WOW!   
Thanks for the Bits !
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:16:49
Not sure how I should respond...
@_date: 2014-10-31 06:13:02
No :(  
No....  
Just trying that's all :)  
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:13:28
This coming from a guy who says gold isn't money.   
That it was collected because it was “traditional”. 
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:17:12
So....there is where all my bits are.
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:15:48
Whoever did this picture is awesome :-D
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:19:15
So...Humans have been fixing it this way forever ! ;p
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:06:45
Ha Ha

If this script is effective, it wouldn't need an ATM to make happen, as a matter of fact, it could make money faster without the drag of the ATMs.    
I would even go so far as to say these script are ALREADY in action, hereby making an ATM system which only "occasionally" use this script to top up to fall right back into the neutral zone of zero advantage.   
What do you think ?   
@_date: 2014-10-31 05:59:19


Well, "Fred-Stiller-OnAWire" is awesome :D
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:49:24

$6 Hooker ?   
Sign me up !  
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:16:25
Hmmm...you comment makes me think....   
Maybe this script DOES exist....but maybe the price of Bitcoin is beyond the threshold range it is allowed to automatically buy from...   
I am just talking nonsense here, I know nothing about the technology behind this particular ATM. 
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:32:47
I don't think it is anatomically possible for me to violate it...
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:42:04
I was there too when I visited the states.
Houston is HUGE!!!!
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:55:27
Thank you so much for the Bits Prime Dice :D
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:31:18
Thank you IBelieveinBitcoin !
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:34:13
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED.   
Maybe they are all just keeping on the down low...collecting and when they have enough, they will embrace it because they will be back to the top of the food chain !
And we will still be poor :(
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:07:10
Me love you long time ;p    
ok, maybe until the Reddit Gold runs out ;p
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:47:37
Attention!   
Someone gave me Reddit Gold/Glided but I don't know how to find out who to thank him/her.    
Who are you ?   
THANK YOU !    
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:36:19
Long Con...you mean that paper with ink of it that the Fed is printing like it is nobody's business ?
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:12:14
I have been single for 30 years...   
No I don't need a gf...I need a robot bf.
@_date: 2014-10-27 15:41:01
Would be nice too if the ATM says "Out of Bitcoin, reverting back to Mining..." but for that to happen, this box must be damn powerful ;p
@_date: 2014-10-27 14:52:29
Not that it is relavent to this at all, but since we are on this topic, I actually make a video talking about me being single for 30 years !   
   
[PS: I am gay]  
Again NOT relevant, just answering your comment completely.
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:09:40
Oh No....    
Maybe they should start a school lesson named: "How to hit your devices just right so that they will work again".
@_date: 2014-10-27 12:11:17
Yeah...but WHY ME ???!!!    
Why can't some OTHER people learn that lesson that day ? Why Me!   
Ha Ha Ha
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:43:13
Thanks.  
It was a Christmas Gift from my friends back when I was in Providence Rhode island, I have no idea what brand it belongs to, I am not a brand person, sorry :(
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:36:30
The hooker up her price by 3x the minute she saw my face...    
I have to turn it down...
@_date: 2014-10-27 13:51:14
As punishment, they should send me back to 2009 when Bitcoin was first born so that I can buy me a Sack of Bitcoins.
@_date: 2014-10-27 16:11:04
Hmmm.....   
Now I am doing the evil laugh...
@_date: 2014-11-21 22:14:09
Well said! Bravo !
@_date: 2014-10-31 06:05:10
I wish I am super rich.    
On that very day, we were have some "urges" and the nearest toilet after our long way is a high class hotel.  
I remember going in with the cloth you saw in the photo and telling myself "Oh my god...I am so poor...I probably looked poor and walked poor, I hope they don't chase me out".  
I just wish I get to experience how it feels like to be rich...to be "privilege", he he he
