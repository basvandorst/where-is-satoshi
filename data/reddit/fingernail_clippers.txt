You only have to read the site's tagline to realize that all of their articles are bearishly-biased: "On a long enough timeline the survival rate for everyone drops to zero".
Because the site is consistently bearish, they end up looking like geniuses when the economy or stock market do take a hit. But in reality, even a broken clock is right twice a day. If you are 100% bearish all the time or 100% bullish all the time, you'll eventually be right.

Sorry, but why would you work with someone in a venture like this who claims to control a lot of Bitcoins but refuses to disclose how many there are or what they're being used for?
Everything about this story shows that everyone involved was incompetent and shouldn't be involved in running a business. That includes the "Compliance and Risk Management Officer" who wasn't even capable of managing risk and the CFO who didn't have access to the finances.
Seriously, what were you guys thinking? It's like a bunch of teenagers got together and decided to run a business and then gave themselves C-level titles without any idea of what the jobs actually involved.

Not being based on the original BTC source code would be a good start. Almost all of the source files in Dogecoin and other BTC derivatives still carry the Bitcoin Developers copyright.

Sorry, but living in a country or doing business with anyone who lives there is also passive support for its social and economic policies.
Earning money and paying taxes on it is passive support for its social and economic policies.
Pretty much the only way to not be involved in the monetary system is to live in the woods and be completely self-sufficient.

LOL, these guys posted on the ycombinator forum freaking out that their site was being used for money laundering. I'm surprised it's still up. I wonder if they actually took the advice of everyone in the thread and talked to an actual lawyer?

The US government has liquidated the properties involved in a crime without a conviction for a long time. All they have to do is prove that the property was involved in a crime, not that a specific person committed it.


If they proved that the bitcoins were used to purchase drugs, then the bitcoins can be seized and liquidated without convicting any person of a crime.

There's a lot of misleading and incorrect text on the site:


Saying it's an unregulated trade system is incorrect, since all nations regulate trade in some way. Just because you use bitcoin in a transaction doesn't mean you don't have to pay attention to regulations and taxes and tariffs. 
Suggesting that crypto is unbreakable is also misleading, and using the words 'mathematical cryptography' together is redundant.
This paragraph itself is enough to scare some people away form BitCoin, like [Max_Findus]( is suggesting.
If you read the definitions of Bitcoin on Wikipedia or the Bitcoin Foundation or even the original Bitcoin whitepaper itself, you won't see them use the words unregulated or unbreakable, because Bitcoin is neither.


This is misleading enough to be dangerous. First of all, credit cards aren't cash, they're credit. Credit cards can be cancelled and charges can be reversed. If you lose a credit card, you don't lose any money. Credit cards are basically the polar opposite of Bitcoin. Why not just say "cash in your wallet", because cash is a currency, just like Bitcoin?

You can't really compare BIT to a regulated ETF or mutual fund. It's more like a hedge fund, and BIT is cheap compared to many hedge funds.

If you transfer your bitcoins to someone else, they're no longer your bitcoins.
Traditional banks in the US have the FDIC to back up their deposits - if they bank goes under, you still get your deposit. There's no such deposit insurance with bitcoin "banks" or exchanges. If they go under, your BTC is gone.

Not a complete moron, just ignorant of security. If you use a browser to trade bitcoins, you shouldn't use that browser for anything else. Period. If you do, you're opening yourself up to attack.
Either people don't understand that, or they're too lazy, but either way people will continue losing money because of security ignorance.

The crisis is that people think it's ok to install a browser extension that has full access to the content of every page you visit, then handle bitcoins with that browser.

Let's see... Wences Casares founded Lemon.com, which he sold off to LifeLock, which is a huge scam of a business that has been sued many times for false advertising, the founder was ousted after being arrested for unpaid gambling debts in Las Vegas, and the CEO had his identity stolen 13 times after posting his social security number to promote his company's service. I guess that can be considered a success?
Federico Murrone was CTO of something called "Bling Nation", a mobile payments company that went out of business a while ago.
Sorry, but these dudes don't have a great track record. They've both been involved with just as many failed businesses as successful ones.

By "talking about bitcoin" they mean "spamming reddit with links to my bitcoin website".

Coinbase is hiring: 
I know someone who worked there for a "trial" period, which apparently is common for startups now. You do work for cheap and if they like you at the end of the trial period, you get hired full-time.
It sounds like a scam to me and I'd never do that, but apparently it's legit.
It does sound pretty hard to get hired though, they went through 30 interviews and a few trial periods before they hired their first full-time engineer:

A gambling addict loses all of his money because he can't control himself?
CoinBet.cc behaved pretty poorly and likely ripped this guy off, but the way he handled it was insane. "They won't give me my money so I'll place $2million more in bets". What rational person thinks this is a good idea? Hint: No rational person would, this guy wasn't rational, he's an addict.
The story that needs exposed here is that the anonymous nature of Bitcoin means there's an industry full of scammers out there looking to take advantage of people that can't make rational decisions about money. Pitching Bitcoin to these people is like offering free booze to an alcoholic, they're just going to hurt themselves.

Yeah, using Bluetooth LE would open your wallet up to a level of attack that I'm not comfortable with. NFC is a little better - you need to be within a few cm for it to work and there's no persistent connection. QR codes are definitely the safest and most versatile option though.
