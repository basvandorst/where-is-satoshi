Actually, that is not correct.
Putting a wallet on a hard drive would increase its weight. But I adding more Bitcoins to the address wouldn't add additional weight.

So people are transferring BTC out of the exchanges? Which means the are not available to sell? Reducing supply (on the exchanges in the short term)?
Wouldn't this be bullish?

So you are not actually giving them any Bitcoin? Just a piece of paper that allows them to look at Bitcoin addresses you control?

Bullish AF. 
Bitcoin (BTC) is to valuable to spend, which is hampering adoption. 
But now that BCH has reached a record low, nonone could possibly believe it is worth anything. They will all rush to get rid of it, increasing adoption and making it more valuable.
The price of BCH might drop a bit further in the short term, but that is just the remaining people who hoped it had value selling to people who know it is worthless. Once the only people left holding BCH know it is worthless, then adoption will soar and the price will moon.

It should bounce during alt season ;-)

The post title refers to block size, but the chart size I am currently seeing shows block time. Though the medium article presents both charts.
@_date: 2019-01-11 05:09:07
Agreed. Regardless, it is viewable in the medium post.
So any thoughts on the apparent patterns in that chart? I am particularly curious about the apparent hard upper limit on block times in the very early days. There seem to be two distinct early periods, before the move to the normal state?
@_date: 2019-01-10 21:34:48
A few questions.
What is the apparent hard upper limit on block times in the early period?
Blocks with lots of transactions seem to take a lot longer to confirm. I understand some time difference, but it looks significant?

Tulip mania was the result of the launch of a new industry, when everyone scrambled for an early advantage. 400 years later the Netherlands still dominates the tulip industry and it is (and has for 400 years been) a major contributor to the Netherlands economy.
If Bitcoin is 'only' as successful as the tulip industry over the next 400 years, then it is still a huge opportunity.
Admittedly some tulip traders got wrecked... But the hodlers are still there running the industry.

Interesting view, I don't think it matters which came first, so happy to accept that. But I don't think that is important to the overall point. 
The tulip bubble is often referred to in a derisive manner, or as a criticism of bitcoin. However, we both agree the tulip bubble helped established an industry that has flourished for 400 years and is still dominated by the dutch. The economic benefit to the Netherlands from the tulip bubble is incalculable.
Just imagine if Bitcoin also ensures for 400 years like the tulip industry?
