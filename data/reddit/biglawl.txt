I am no sure whether you refer to bitcoin's future downfall or protected status via law.
Well, the exchanges are up and running now. The exchanges will not be shut down as long as one country hosts them.

How old are you?
In general, people do NOT hold cash. Americans only keep about $10,000 USD cash per person (so a couple would have $20,000 USD). The rest of one's savings goes into diversified investments. Investments should be risk-adjusted for your age. Investments usually outpace inflation.
If you are old, I would buy mostly government-backed bonds, like US treasuries.
If you are younger, I would buy a variety of mutual funds, stocks, bonds, ETFs ("exchange traded funds" that track indices) and real estate. I would not keep more than 10% of my net worth in gold, and I would not keep more than 5% of  my net worth in bitcoin - I would probably only keep 1% of my net worth in bitcoin, to be honest.

Governments could shut down the bitcoin exchanges. Bitcoin will fail if new users can't "buy in" to bitcoin. Then, the only way to acquire new bitcoins would be to sell goods/services to an existing bitcoin user.

Are payments via other p2p services still available, such as venmo?

A person can value BTC as either a tech stock or as a commodity.
If you value it as a tech stock, it is valued as if you owned a share in a tech company that allowed you to transact anonymously and without a service fee. At the current price, the company would be valued at $500m.
Some commodities have real world use, like oil. Even gold has industrial uses. BTC has no real world uses. But, much of the value of gold is tied to speculation about future demand and monetary policy. BTC could be a hedge against poor monetary policy as it is fixed in quantity.
