Everything is a bubble since money printing is the only reason banks exists. Nevertheless a crypto correction is overdue.

your username makes sense
EDIT: and the reason you are against cryptos is a) you are a die hard communist or b) not intelligent enough to understand it

The Cryptosphere dissappoints me on a daily basis. WE ARE HERE FOR FREEDOM OF MARKETS AND DECENTRALIZATION. Yes Coinbase fucked up but its upon us to not use them after this and not trying to sue them or yell for regulations. What is wrong with you...

I got your back- im in crypto for two years and only 20% of my holdings are in btc(0% bch). without any doubts it has flaws, huge flaws- the btc fanboyculture is ridicoulus

Actually im working to get my portfolio on point, i think it will take like a week and then im out. holding everything for at least a year. I am going to delete everything cryptorelated- i love the cryptogame but its to interesting and i lack the discipline to get my daily shit togheter beside lurking on reddit and 4chan.

yeah send 10$ and pay 10$ for tx fees
EDIT: I get your point but doing it with bitcoin would be not that clever
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:47:11
i think i got it. btc will stay slower than other cryptos but it will stay decentralized(under ver it wouldnt be). and daily transaction could be done by an alt like bch- which shouldnt call itself "bitcoin"-cash?!

im 100% real- i just want to understand this
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:39:25
dont get me wrong but because of this assumption i think ver is not shittalking. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 20:09:11
i love cryptos but bitcoin is going to kill itself- downvotes incomming- but honestly sell me how this drama will end well regarding scalability, minercartels and wars between each forked bitcoin

sold all for shitcoins back in april (shame on me)

THIS IS THE GUY IM LOOKING FOR! so basically it means that the blocks will be full sooner or later which isnt the real solution. and btc is heading for a better solution but not yet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:38:06
so will btc have the solution or is it going to be a reserve/ gold coin?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:36:25
the "real" bitcoin would be a cheap and fast crypto, isnt it? btc is not fast and cheap compared to bcash/bch
