If there is 3% deflation, then that implies that the economy as a whole is growing at 3%, meaning that the majority of investments produce greater than 3% returns. Thus, it would be perfectly viable for these investments to loan money at 3% and pay it back and still earn a profit.
If, on the other hand, you're taking out a loan so you can have more stuff before you can afford it, then yes, you're screwed.

That won't actually generate any profit for you unless your buyup triggers a whole bunch of buyups by everyone else - otherwise you would be buying coins at an average of $5 and selling them at an average of $5.

But we know that Bitcoin has value. They sell for $4.78 a pop on MtGox. If you're talking about value as in the currency as a whole having value to society rather than just being a gambling game, this is not evidence of that at all - a currency's function is to facilitate trade, not theft.

Because by the time that happened the gold standard was already dead. The Federal Reserve had slowly been printing money in excess of the gold backing it since the Great Depression, each step taken as a short term measure, the politicians backing it hoping that the short-term beneficial effects (ie. kicking the can down the road) would make them look better while the long-term instability would only appear long after they were forgotten. Eventually, reserves were so low that the government had no choice.

If you have a REALLY unusual utility curve, that's actually not necessarily true. Imagine that you're poor and have close to no money, and if you have one more financial mishap you'll go bankrupt. You see a Ponzi scheme that pays 5% per month and, for the sake of argument, you estimate that each week it has a 8% chance of default (monetary EV -3%). So, what happens if you take out $10000 more credit card debt and invest? 90% chance, you get $500 per month in your wallet and you'll be able to afford better food, heating, electricity, healthcare, etc and your standard of living will go up by a lot. 8% chance, you lose the money and you're stuck with $10k credit card debt. In pure monetary terms, the amount you suffer from a default is equal to 20 times your monthly gain. In terms of utility, however, what happens to you in that situation? Basically, you go bankrupt and default on your debt yourself, you do get even poorer in the process, but there is a certain floor of "nothing to lose" below which your living conditions can't go no matter what. Are the consequences really 20 times worse than what you gain by having an extra $500 per month in your wallet? Likely not.

I would say the one amendment to be made is that money needs to be a commonly accepted _formal_ means of exchange. Beer and pot are not money at all; I have never heard of anyone offering something directly in exchange for it (cocaine, on the other hand, maybe in some underground circles). As for favors, they only work among friends, so they fail the formality criterion. Formality means that it can be used between people who don't know each other at all, and perhaps don't even care about each other at all beyond the scope of a single transaction. Once you have that, every other characteristic is just a good quality for money to have.

The reason why those patterns in the price of oranges exist is that oranges have a high storage cost and low lifetime, preventing speculators from bringing the cyclical patterns down to zero.

Yes, the "kind of ethics that make you sad for a while if you violate them". Ethics and laws are different things, and ethics still exist in the absence of laws. It is still unethical to kill someone on an anarchic desert island, but the only ethics that survive there are those of the philosophical variety that you so disparage.
"Legal ethics" are not ethics, they are laws. You break them and get caught, there are set penalties. You can call them laws, or ethics, or chickens, but that does not change what they are. Imagine if you were living under a totalitarian government that required you to subscribe to a list of "ethics" with rules like "don't ever go outside without permission if you're a woman". Would you consider a woman daring to illegally go outside under such conditions to be acting _unethically_?

I would go with the exponentially sized buckets myself. Send 157 units, the system asks for 8 addresses, and sends 128, 16, 8, 4 and 1 units to the appropriate five. Really big outputs may need to be split up more since they're rarer, so you could make it less than exponential at higher levels. Then combine that with blind signing so you don't have to trust the  system (and someone release an open source blind signing protocol and app so we don't have to trust the individual websites, which would defeat the point).

I'll defend the libertarian ideal for the fun of it.


This is probably the crux of our disagreement. Why must everyone within a geographical area be forcibly bound together? You say "economically and geographically bordered", but the whole point of Bitcoin and even Paypal (and the entire last six decades) is that countries are not economically bordered anymore, so all we have is geographic. That's it. Geographic. Why does geography matter? It used to because economic and social activity happened within geographical areas (well, it would have happened in a geographical mesh but overpowered nation states tend to encourage closed region-based society and economy to emerge instead), but now physical place is important for neither. You can talk to people over the internet, and you can engage in commerce over the internet. Reddit and ebay are our analogue of the ancient city center/agora/marketplace.
This has provided a wonderful advancement for the freedom of the individual: we are no longer forced to associate with people we don't want to. People who say that this is a bad thing forget what society is: society comes from the Latin _socii_, allies, and society is really an _alliance_. It is not something we are "stuck with", it is something we engage in voluntarily for our mutual benefit (there's the "public good" for you). If you are a black person in a 99% white geographical area, or an atheist in a 99% Muslim area, it becomes much more clear that being forced to associate with people just because they are who you're stuck with is not virtuous, it is hell. Saying that it is not virtuous for people to eschew their geographical bonds in favor of bonds of genuine friendship and solidarity based on common interests is like saying that our hypothetical 1% atheists should just accept the society they live in and go to the mosque along with everyone else. Voluntary bonds are not "fictional", they are not a pathetic substitute for genetic and/or coercive bonds, they are superior to them. Society is based on common interests, and in our world we are just as likely to have similar interests to someone 1000 km away as we are to our next door neighbor, and the only way to find our own friends, our own allies, our own society, is to acquire them voluntarily. Voluntary society is society 2.0.
And no, this will not promote tribalism and violence, this will promote peace. With the internet, the world is not a collection of separated regions, it is a mesh, and through a series of linkages everyone is connected to everyone else - we used to be 10000 kilometers apart, now we are a mere six degrees of separation apart, and that value is reducing even further as we speak. If anyone goes to war in an internet -linked world, they are going to war against a friend of a friend, so a strategy of hostility is no longer possible.

They actually are. If you ask people how banks earn a profit, the most common, and in a free market economy correct, answer you will get is that they allow you to deposit money at some interest rate and then loan it out to other people at a higher interest rate, and if you proceed to ask them how they can fund your withdrawals at any time if they're loaning the money out they'll think for 2 seconds and probably reply that they're keeping a fraction in reserve just in case.
People like banks. They like the fact that they can earn profits off their money without thinking about it. This is a market fact, and the market's job is to meet people's preferences, not try and enforce its morality on others. Yes, the pyramid can get unstable, but the business principles behind banks, if they do not get out of control, are quite sound.
@_date: 2011-07-30 11:01:11


In a free market, there's a place for both - you can go to local stores for everyday stuff and the big stores for the stuff you buy in bulk - the effort of physically going to the store (obviously less for small local stores) is part of the purchasing cost. You do need a balance between small business and big business. As another example, consider Google - Google gives us lots of free stuff like Android, Chrome, considerable help with Firefox, etc. There are no ads in sight on any of these (there are on Android, but the profits from those mainly go to the application developers). Why? Because these goods make the internet stronger as a whole, and this benefits Google's business. If Google was 100x smaller than it is, the cost to Google to do all this would be the same (maybe up to 2x less due to reduced institutional/bureaucratic inefficiency) but the share of the public benefit that Google would take for itself would be 100x less, so it would not be worth it for Google to do any of that. This is an instance of the [public goods]( problem.
Back to the topic, libertarians feel that the current style of regulation results in far more big business than would happen naturally or would be optimal since the bureaucratic regulatory requirements, inspections, etc, are far easier for big businesses which can afford to leave one or two employees specialized to dealing with government than for small businesses, for whom the bureaucratic burden is the same but is far more significant due to their small size. The court system, where expensive legal teams can often beat the kind of lawyers small businesses and individuals can afford, adds to this, as does the tax system, where big businesses can afford to spend a lot of legal effort finding and exploiting loopholes to massively reduce their tax burden while small ones can't - your Mom and Pop can't hire someone to set up a subsidiary in Ireland (or whatever people do these days).
The regulation also makes it much harder for an individual to be self-employed than an employee, where the company handles your taxes and keeps up to date on the regulations, increasing the supply and thus lowering the price of employee labor, so you can see how much of our income inequality flows from there.

Lotteries don't take from the poor any more than circuses, movie theaters and restaurants take from the poor. People are putting in money voluntarily so by the principle of expressed preference (aka "actions speak louder than words") they clearly value the entertainment of putting their money into a pool and seeing who wins and/or hoping they'll win more than they value the money itself, so the poor are actually benefitting.

@_date: 2011-10-22 11:19:17


That's not how supply and demand works. Increasing the supply by a factor of X does not necessarily decrease the price by a factor of X. Rather, if supply exceeds demand then the price will keep going down until the dropping prices increase the demand, so if only 5% of the bitcoins are being actively bought and sold then that 35% growth is really 700% growth.

Actually, if you read the justification (see [here]( Lolcust used for fixed permanent growth of supply, not quite. Coins get lost over time, so you don't know if 21 100 BTC is 4.7E-7, 5 E-7 or even 9.4E-7 if half of all coins disappear. Fixed growth of supply results in a fixed size of supply assuming that people's carelessness remains fixed, so your coins' value will, as a share of all the world's wealth, remain roughly constant if you can hold onto them.

What economic reason would there be for connected mining to increase the correlation between prices? The supply of bitcoin and namecoin is static, the number of miners has nothing to do with the amount mined, so the fact that bitcoin and namecoin are mined by the same people means nothing whatsoever to the market (well, it will increase the portion of miners who are in it for the profit, so that will increase the market supply for namecoin in particular, but that's about it). The two markets are ruled by their own independent supply and demand.

Bitcoin Weekly had some articles about this:
The idea is that (1) there is no other way that things could have been done, and (2) the mining incentive, to which the number of miners is proportional will go down exponentially anyway, so we're fine in the long run. The only danger is that the market of miners and transaction fees does not know how much power the network needs to have running to protect against attackers, so we'll probably either end up with too much or too little.

Ok, here's the entire process:
1. Put $93000 into Liberty Reserve. You have: 0 BTC, 93000 LR USD
2. Sell $93000 into 10000 BTC on MtGox. You have: 10000 BTC, 0 LR USD
3. Wait a while, then start recomputing a chain 5 blocks behind the real one. You have: (Chain 1 - public) 10000 BTC, (Chain 2 - in your darknet) 10000 BTC, 0 LR
4. Sell the 10000 BTC in the public chain for $93000 USD. You have: (Chain 1) 0 BTC, (Chain 2, in your darknet) 10000 BTC, (LR) $93000 USD
5. Wait until Chain 2 overtakes chain 1 and release it into the wild.  Chain 1 is let to fall. You have: (Chain 2 - public) 10000 BTC, (LR) $93000 USD
6. Sell your 10000 BTC for $93000 USD. You have (LR) $186000 USD.

The tumbler itself is essentially a centralized currency, sort of like MtGox codes, backed up by the possibility of the owner X tumbler coin to ask for X bitcoin in exchange with the pattern that I already described.
To send coins secretly, you would send coins to the tumbler along with a blinded certificate. The tumbler would take the coins, sign the blinded certificate, and send the blinded certificate to you. You would unblind the certificate, send it to the recipient, and the tumbler would recognize the correctly signed certificate and give the recipient the coins.

Zero _present_ effort. That's what it is psychologically. Economically, they're earning money for their past effort, exactly equivalent to how if a farmer buys a tractor his productivity goes up forever (even if you take into account the effort of maintaining it) just because of the one effort of working to buy it.
Normally, the interest rates that the banks offer are slightly above the inflation rate, it's just that now with the governments trying to pretend the interest rate is zero things are different from what they usually are.
As for index funds, the thing is that there is no such thing as a free lunch. In reality, they are just as unstable as the banks. If everyone asks for their money back from a bank, the bank crashes, some people get their money back but the rest don't. If everyone asks for their money back from an index fund, the stock price crashes to zero and everyone gets varying percentages of their money back. Any mechanism that allows you to invest your money in a long-term project and take as much money out as you want at the same time is a contradiction, and thus unstable. Theoretically, there could be a company that gives out consumer loans and mortgages and has a stock as a way of acquiring funding, and there could be a tech company that provides interest to people who deposit on the side as a way of acquiring funding. The two have their advantages and disadvantages (although with Bitcoin and related technologies, I imagine the fees you metioned would become insignificant pretty quickly).
You are right that hoarding cash in a non-inflationary currency is the best of all, since you're essentially providing a loan of physical wealth to the entire world, although it's actually also susceptible to a bank run - if everyone empties their hoards at the same time, the quantity of money increases, you get inflation, and if it's serious enough, hyperinflation. Looks like there are no profits without risks, which makes sense - there is no doing _anything_ without risk.

The mining effort that you put in DOES NOT SCALE with the amount of money you put in. The mining effort is 51% of the network multiplied by the small amount of time you need to pull the plan off.

Even if transaction fees actually worked that way, then a payment of 0.00004235 BTC would have a fee of 4E-8, a payment of 0.00006697 BTC would have a fee of 7E-8, etc. No problem there. In reality, though, transaction fees are whatever you want them to be so the problem doesn't exist at all.
There are currently [$3 trillion actual USD]( floating around in the US. Assuming a Bitcoin world would be more averse to multiplying money through fractional reserve banking, we'll make that $10 trillion. $10 trillion / 2.1E15 units = $0.0047 per unit, so twice the divisibility we have now.

Except mining the second 10000 btc would take a long time - only 30 hours in your darknet, true, but if the attack scales up to 50000 btc it would take 150 hours, and so on. My attack takes a few hours at most, and the amount of time it takes does not increase with the amount of coins you double spend. This has nothing to do with mining - the 10000 BTC you buy can be old coins or fairly new coins (as long as they're older than when you split off the chain).

You are correct here. I just phrased my conclusion dismissively because we were talking about merged mining causing a stronger correlation between namecoin and bitcoin prices, which the effect I described would not do. If we're talking about what the general long-term consequences to namecoin prices are, then yes I think they will end up lower than they would have been otherwise.


I guess I meant something closer to "predetermined". As for the namecoin difficulty rollercoaster, I don't follow Namecoin enough to know if such a thing exists, if it does then yes that would veer reality off of my constant supply assumption. Mathematically, more rollercoaster means more supply (to illustrate the mathematical principle with an extreme case, if difficulty goes up and down by 10x, during the low difficulty parts the creation rate could go up to 10x what it should be but during the high difficulty parts the creation rate would only go down to 0.1x, so on average coins would be coming in 5.05x faster), so merged mining would bring stability thus reducing supply, actually counteracting the increased supply effect.ple, difficulty goes up and down by 4x, during the low difficulty parts the creation rate could go up to 4x what it should be but during the high difficulty parts the creation rate could go down to 0.25x, so on average 2.125x faster than what it was meant to be), so merged mining would bring stability thus reducing supply, actually counteracting the increased supply effect.
