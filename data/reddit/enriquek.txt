Due to volatile market and changes in the way zebpay operates, the profits have reduced for sure.
Right now it’s 150 USD each if one trades BTC worth 5000 USD. 
GDAX buy price: 11339 USD
ZebPay Sell Price: 840779
77 USD for 2500 USD investment.
Profits also plunged cause of a new expense component that we did not factor in earlier.
The arbitrage model we use, improoves each day as we trade and explore more n more...

I can’t be certain but I am hopeful. I have seen it go negative and spike up again many times.
@_date: 2018-01-25 04:22:22
These spikes occur every week once at least.
The profit went negative as of recent prices. However, with some creative solutions, profits can be made.
Sure, i would be interested in partnership as long as we both make profits.
Inbox me contact details.
I am going through some personal family matters. Spendig a lot of time in hospital so expect some delays. We can setup a meeting by next week.

Zebpay is best for this. There prices are stable. They have less impact of BTC price drops from US. They also have high volumes in trades.

It’s as simple as it looks.
Buy from GDAX.
Transfer to indian exchange.
Sell at higher price.
Calculate the currency exchange factor.
Calculate profits.
Return money to buyer with profit.
Test it with small ammounts first.

Yes it does not. That’s why you need a partner who is from US. Reddit is a great place to look for one if you dont know anyone or no one believes you that it can work.

Two ways of money conversion:
Paypal does the conversion for you. This costs a lot.
The payment gateway provider does the conversion for you. It’s much better option. Generally a conversion factor of 0.0157 works.
i.e. 1 INR = 0.0157 USD
Both of these options are presented to sender in paypal portal while making payments.
Ofcouse we know which one is selected by default.
PS: today is a good day to arbitrage. Made 148$ within 4 hours.

Only Thing stopping is the trust.
I posted a BTC Arbitrage oppotunity on reddit and everyone called me a scam. But then there was this one guy who enquired about it. and For sure we made profit in last couple of days.
If it keeps on going like this, I think we will make close to 10000$ for each of us by the end of 3 months with close to 21 trades.

That's there. I am not sure how to overcome this. Trust is a barrier here. All I can do is try to convince...
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:52:10
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:55:26
We can discuss that further. Bank transfer works as well.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:56:56
Have not explored Ether yet.. Will check it out.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:44:51
God. You are a sad person.
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:59:08
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:56:08
Sure. I can wire your some money. probably not $16k. If you are really interested. let me know... Thanks
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:58:38
TBH. I am not sure either. Ask around.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:05:53
Yeah!!! I don't make that much.
@_date: 2017-12-08 22:02:32
No I don't know how to program. What do you say about I transfer $10 to your account and then you can buy and send BTC to my wallet.
I am ready to take slight risk of losing $10 here. Are you?
