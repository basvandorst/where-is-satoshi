I have lowered the fee to 5% for now, thanks for the feedback!

thanks for your support! i've worked my butt of on this project :)
It may be easier to denominate in mBTC, I'm really not sure. I don't think in terms of mBTC myself, but it seems more and more people are. I am really looking for a lot of user feedback to make the site better. 
About the 5 BTC contests, you never know. I believe Yahoo has some very expensive contests. If it becomes clear that nobody is interested in these contests, we'll think about removing them. In the meantime, there are plenty of openings in the 1k sat. and .005 btc contests.

First game is free.

Live scores are updated within 25 seconds. Live scores are estimated, but guaranteed to be correct by contest payout.

hey, thanks!
I hope this site becomes popular with Bitcoin Basketball fans :)
We also have a fully translated chinese version, you know how popular the NBA is in China!

That's correct. One reason for this is that it would interfere with the provably fair system.
@_date: 2016-02-19 03:51:04
In case anyone is wondering about the provably fair part (I'm really excited about this)
teams are hashed using SHA-512 and made publicly available before the contest. The lineups are then made public after the contest starts. As far as I know, this makes mvplineup THE most secure dfs site in terms of knowing that lineups haven't been tampered with.
