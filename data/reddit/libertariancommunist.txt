You first send me bitcoin at 15hfHnmyhWXW7Fmf1ykkB2qy3BxdY3int7 and I will send you twice the amount back.
Fair deal, right?

You need to read the whole source code. If you don't understand that, you don't understand Bitcoin.
The source code is here
good luck!

OK. If you are not joking:
There is no central bank. Just users buying from each other.
On servers like localbitcoins, you can find some other people who want to sell. It's a great way to buy small amounts. You meet the merson or negotiate bank exchange, exchange the money and you are ready to go.
If you want to buy bigger amounts, try exchanges like bitstamp or btc-e. However, you first need to put some money there, and also load up some information about yourself, and it is kind of time consuming and not really worth it if it is just a small amount, in my opinion.
There might be some exchange based in India. Since I am in Europe, I have no idea.
Also, Krshna is awesome, but Kali is awesomer. Kill all the enemies and cut off their heads!

I am a MtGox insider.
I can confirm that MtGox is insolvent. Also, Mark stole all the 1 billion of bitcoins and now is on the run to Bangkok, with his cat.
@_date: 2014-05-25 15:43:59
Yes. Coinbase is moving coins offchain and is essentially acting like a bank.
@_date: 2014-03-02 21:43:44
...oh. Haha. You fucker.
@_date: 2014-03-27 08:21:50
I agree, but it's nice to see concrete numbers and how many orders of magnitude away the real numbers and Gox numbers are.

Bitcoin is more unpredictable than most investments though. Sometimes it's like on crack.

It is meant to be a nonsence, two words that don't work together. Just like "Canadian developer".

These are actually good news.

Well. I don't want to sound too cocky, but... seriously? 0.5 milibitcoins? It will hardly cover the fees. 
I guess I'm gonna bet that on the least probable SatoshiDice address.

Well, buy some.
And then send them to me.

I am actually planning to do the same. I am thinking of doing all my trip with bitcoin - from buying ticket to renting a building on 9flats. (Probably not food.)
I found out that the only places on 9flats that accept bitcoin are those with "instant bookings". I am not sure why (that's a question for , a 9flats developer), but it filters out the cheapest places and leaves only the more expensive hotels :/

Wasn't there a algorithmic trader that read the trollbox and bought on every "buy" and sold on every "sell" in it?
I cannot find it right now. I wonder how is it doing.
