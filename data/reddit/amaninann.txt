Does anyone know the tax implications (in the US) of lightning payments? Do you have to track every payment you make and report capital gains if the value of bitcoin increased between the time you acquired it and the time you used it to buy something via lightning?

You need to vary your spiel depending on your audience. If it's the first time they've heard about it keep it very simple, something like "It's like email for money". Resist getting into much more detail even if they ask. If they ask again another time then you might go a little deeper. But if you try to go from simple to complicated in one conversation it won't go well.

The biggest social inequality of all time is within communist regimes - between those in power and those not. In other words, those who eat and those who starve.

Yeah, that's the worst part isn't it? Taking advantage of the most vulnerable...

Or you could set off a nuke in fort Knox, radiating the gold and thereby making it worthless. Thus making your own gold reserves worth more.

Does anyone actually expect bitcoin to be a viable option in a total collapse situation like Venezuela? I know I don't. At best I hope it may help prevent things getting this bad in the future by taking away a powerful tool of oppression (control of the monetary supply) from corrupt governments. Unfortunately bitcoin didn't come soon enough for Venezuela apparently.

The idea is to survive until you have access to it again, either by moving to another country or after the government is overthrown and society is rebuilt. Think of it like a way to "weather the storm" and hopefully preserve some of your wealth.
If you're prepping for a situation where power/internet will never be available again then you're right, bitcoin won't help you.

I was referring specifically to a different version of bitcoin, not insulin. Are you OK with letting the market decide in this case, or what else would you propose (specifically regarding bitcoin)?

I think trying to explain it is a waste of time. If someone asks me to explain it I will offer to help them install a wallet on their phone, and give them $10 worth of bitcoin. If they aren't interested in doing this then I'll politely tell them I'm not going to waste my time explaining it to them.

Connections are not direct. They are routed through a mesh network of connected lightning nodes. Like internet routing, you don't need a direct point-to-point connection to every web site you visit.

You realize there is a picture at the top of this post with a giant pile of gold in a bank vault, right? Wouldn't it be better to use it in electronic components or something? You've got it all wrong about efficiency. See fiat is 100% a waste of energy so bitcoin is infinitely efficient in comparison.

Now that we have bitcoin we can stop wasting gold by pointlessly using it as money instead of for its more useful physical properties.
@_date: 2019-01-22 17:42:43
Real physical uses besides money hurts it as a store of value. I mean iron has a lot of real physical uses and it's a shitty SoV, right? Gold is a good SoV because it *does not* have real physical uses (except for negligible use in industry), and it's basically indestructible. Bitcoin is even better because it has no real physical use at all.
@_date: 2018-03-11 17:43:15
Sure, and IF everyone just decided to stop using it and shut down all nodes and mining it would go away. Who cares about "if" and "could"? The real question is what is likely to happen. I don't think a coordinated effort by all governments to shut it down would be as easy as you think. Of course it's technically possible, but worldwide coordination is not easy to pull off.

I meant *be willing* to answer any question, not answer literally every question.

@_date: 2018-04-04 15:09:04
Is there ever a time when people aren't free to ask whatever they want on reddit? I wouldn't call it an "obligation" but if you come here and say "ask me any question" to me that implies that you're willing to answer any question. Otherwise what's the significance of doing an AMA? How is this different than providing a list of approved questions? Apparently there is a list of approved questions in this case. We just don't know if a question is on it until we ask it. Do you think having approved questions is in line with the spirit of AMAs on reddit?
@_date: 2018-04-04 14:04:08
Yeah, I get it. I guess I always thought AMA meant there's no question I won't answer.
@_date: 2018-04-04 15:15:12
Why, because I disagree with some people about what an AMA is? That's kind of harsh.
