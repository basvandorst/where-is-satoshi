For what we have open now, a Moneygram transfer can be sent to Europeans.  In the next 3-5 days we will have Western Union and Wire Transfers available.  
We hope to have all options rolled out from "invite only mode" to "open to the public mode" within the next two weeks.  All options will also have international accessibility.
**TL;DR:**  to get started and then use  to find a location.  Or watch  on twitter to see when Western Union is available.

Because of the work I've done in the past, fraud and money laundering are what I'm most worried about so this is what we've spent most of our time on.
When I worked at [large "too big to fail" financial corporation] I had A LOT of resources at my disposal, most of which I held on to as they weren't proprietary to the company.  We had different material for different types of businesses.  Listed in this material were common types of fraud, various 'patterns' to look for,etc..
I went through and made a nice big comprehensive list of all of these "patterns", so to speak, from similar brick and mortar businesses and MSBs.  Some examples would be: check cashing businesses, "we buy gold" businesses, payday loan businesses, money transfer services, etc..  
I also paid a Net+/Security+ guy $150 to sit down for two hours and add to my list what types of "patterns" that someone committing online fraud would go through.
All of this information was given to our programmer and about 90% of his time on the clock over the last week was spent doing this.  We had worked on a similar "learning based" system (though not for fraud) for a tech startup we invested in a few years ago, so he was able to use some of that code and expand from there.
My business partner, our programmer, and myself, all spent a full day just inputting A LOT of "test" transactions (obviously with the payment part of it turned off) with slight tiny variations so we could get both test the system out and to give it a jump start with learning what a proper transaction should be like.
I hope this answers your question, I'm not a programmer or designer really so I couldn't tell you the language it's written in or the actual mathematics and theories behind it all.  If you're still curious I can check with our programmer and see what kind of information we can divulge without giving away too many of our newly formed trade secrets.

I just got my email back from him: "This was based entirely off of that project you commissioned me for [company name deleted], I really don't think you would want me to give out the specifics of it because then a potential scammer/hacker would be able to "learn" what the website is looking for.
Please tell the poster on Reddit that if he's interested in this sort of thing, he should check out MALLET, it's a Java based open source machine based learning and cluster modeling platform.  It can be downloaded for free at:  and there is a great tutorial online at:

https SSL cert is there when you're redirected to the payment page.  
Our "full non-beta" version will have the SSL certs on everything, even on pages where you enter your name and email address.
right now for the two options open to the public we just use an external coinbase page, the full version will still use coinbase via their api but also have some redundant backup options as well

Hi, thanks for mentioning us.  Currently our delay is based on the conversion of our bitcoins on hand into $USD.  As we build up a higher $USD reserve we will be able to offer instant transfers and limits.  Currently after we process 25BTC for the day, that's when the delay kicks in.  Otherwise the 'instant money' options are, just that, instant, (Wire transfer, western union, money gram, etc..).  Any other delays are transit time for items that are being mailed or fedexed (cashiers checks, money orders, etc..)
Please feel free to PM me or contact us via the website if you have any questions.

As mentioned in my other thread, I have a great deal of experience in the world of finance with a heavy emphasis on anti-money laundering and fraud prevention training for businesses. 
You should trust me because I know exactly just how hard white collar criminals are being cracked down upon and are earning themselves tougher and tougher sentences.
You should trust us, as a company, because we are in this for the long haul.  Bitcoin is going to explode and we want to provide and establish our spot in the Bitcoin industry, so that when this explosion happens users will have somebody with a wonderful reputation.
Small profits from A LOT of satisfied clients over a long period of time adds up WAY more then just a few quick scam deals where someone would take the money and run.
**I need to thank you** for asking that question.  I just sent our programmer an email asking him if he can add something to our 'full version' 'non-beta' website that would maybe allow feedback from satisfied customers, maybe from some remotely hosted third party service that would be impossible or very hard for website owners to fake or tamper with.  If anyone has any suggestions of such service then we are all ears!
