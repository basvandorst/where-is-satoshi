I am using Guarda Wallet. For a new user, Guarda Wallet allows you to easily receive, send, store and exchange many cryptocurrencies. You can easily access the wallet via phone, computer, chrome extension, .. 
And the most important thing is confidentiality. Guarda does not store any customer information, wallet data or private keys. The private key is stored in the device's secure memory and is automatically deleted if you log out of the wallet.
It won't make you disappointed !
