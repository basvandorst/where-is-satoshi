Great topic! Thanks for sharing, gonna look into this more. Wouldn't you only have to report when you actually sell and then have to pay capital gains? 
We have a lyric about how a lot of crypto lovers feel about this issue in our Bitcoin parody version of Mariah Carey's "All I Want For Christmas Is You". If you enjoy give it a like, a share, and donate some coins ;)

My dad fled at that same time, crazy stuff. I wish Americans would see socialism doesn't work. Giving your freedoms to the government is a terrible idea.
