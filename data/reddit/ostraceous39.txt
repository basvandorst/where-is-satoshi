I think that would be a confident bet, I believe they took like 5-10% when i was turning coins in the cash at the local supermarket with a coinstar machine.

If i were to put my mind in the criminal shoe,  if im going to do something illegal, might as well go all out. I would have bought a lot of bitcoin using the cash send it out to a wallet, and with the pretense knowing there is cash from me inside the machine i would have broke in and taken it. 
Also for the atm owner, where was your atm located, always thought of buying one myself, didnt know if it was profitable or not and never dipped my toes in

One thing i gave up with bitcoin is flexing my money on the streets and losing my capability to cat call because i couldn't flex.

Don't know how these companies really work, seems like to be stores that work just like atms. Also I feel like they have a high percentage cut from actual price.

I wish it would happen but to break the truth with you, this dump didn’t catch enough attention, more like a milking cow instead of a bull.

To be honest with you anyone who is an "Expert" on cnbc etc is exaggerating, claims of 20k to 40k. Its a different number every single week.
