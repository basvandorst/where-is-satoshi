This article by Vinny Lingham outlines why BU isn't just another altcoin.

Could be this weekend.

It's YOOGE.

Never heard of them. Are they legit? 
Edit: Why is their exchange rate so high? It says 1 btc = $808 right now, coindesk says it's 1 btc = $800

How's this? 
@_date: 2017-10-05 21:09:08
Once it reaches that point the ROI will be way less attractive.

Lol, I'm a bull as much as anyone but this is just classic copywriting 101 stuff to make you feel FOMO and pay for James' $2000 newsletter.

Of course there's an exit strategy, but I'm in this for the long haul for 10+ years. I'm sure many other hodlers are the same. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 02:21:47
As usual, hodlers are rewarded. 
@_date: 2017-10-17 15:00:11
How's it going OP? 
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:03:12
Just more baseless China FUD

Market will be more efficient and some level of price stability will be reached. Probably like the gold market.

Can you imagine if Trump tweeted about bitcoin next? Hopefully positively of course. 
@_date: 2017-05-02 14:00:17
To the moon baby.
@_date: 2017-05-11 14:24:52
I'm happy about the price increase. But I also can't stop regretting the bitcoins I've cashed out. 
how 2 deal? 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:47:40
lol the guy admitted he knows nothing about eth. his only argument is eth is eating up bitcoin's share of the cryptomarket. i'm sure you're secretly laughing at his logic 
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:49:48
This Vivek Wadhwa guy is a joke despite all his fancy credentials. 
@_date: 2017-05-25 15:43:11
It seems you're most bullish about btc and eth? Are there any others? 
@_date: 2017-07-10 14:36:29
More like paying for fake news amirite 
@_date: 2017-05-19 15:40:12
lol this kind of thinking will make you miserable
@_date: 2017-05-02 13:59:50
Anyone here still buying/holding accumulating coins at these prices? Averaging up sucks but in a few years from now it'll probably be the right decision. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 01:20:48
If I'm a long term hodler and have my btc in a hardware wallet, do I have to do anything after Aug 1 regardless of outcome? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 15:21:55
Yea bitcoin's all about me. How dumb are you? 
@_date: 2017-06-08 14:47:24
It's healthy to be thinking about these issues. What you're doing is blind ignorance yelling lalalalala and avoiding the problem.
@_date: 2017-06-23 17:20:50
Definitely noticed this myself. r/btc almost seems happy about the prospect of bitcoin dying just so they can so "i told you so" 
@_date: 2017-06-23 15:25:39
I don't think you'll get an unbiased opinion in this sub. Do what I do and read both subreddits.
@_date: 2017-06-12 13:20:53
This is cognitive dissonance at its finest. 
@_date: 2017-06-20 19:00:11
Funny, I just wore this [bitcoin rollercoaster t-shirt]( ) to work yesterday 
@_date: 2017-06-01 17:58:49
Curious why you browse this subreddit? I'd imagine it'd be like torturing yourself.
