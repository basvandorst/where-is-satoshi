Exactly man. from a really basic standpoint. If your government is scared of an internet coin then probably can't be trusted with all of your countries wealth.

You just wait I bet they said that before the realisation of current currency.

Mental that you'd have to invest 10 grand now and btc get to 1m to be a millionaire but a few years back you could have invested like 100 and been that much better off. 20/20 for ya

The question is how much would you have to invest now or over the next 10 years to be set for life there after.

Or if you don't have more than 100 a month to invest if someone wants to give me a small loan of a million dollars I'll put it all in btc

Enough that if btc reached 1million tomorrow if still have to go to work forever.

Funny all my mates buy their drugs down the road for GBP haha

Yes because it's new, but over the next 50 years it could solve alot of problems, you can't get rich off of something that isn't worth anything in the long run. Once the price settles though fuck knows how high it will be in worth per btc. Like 1 might buy a house.

But I thought the whole point was that eventually everyone will have bitcoin or something as standard?

If it hits 100M I will blow you. After I buy a lambo.

Indeed I was one of the ones who thought bout buying when it was like a few quid a coin just because it seemed a cool idea. But now I just bought in yesterday. Still have good feelings.

Exactly the way I see it, used to bet on sports ect or buy to much takeout now this is much more fun and more chance of staying green.
