Basically you make a deal to sell your bitcoin for a certain price on a certain date no matter the price
You hope the actual price is lower than what you sell it for
They hope it's higher

Doesn't hurt to invest in things like litecoin. Not a ton but a little 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:29:13
This is how it's meant to behave 
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:31:44
 I think it'll keep getting higher just not at the crazy rate it has been lately 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:43:44
Well they already own their bitcoin but then they can't start doing future contracts
But if they were to sell a massive amount really low
It would make people panic and the price will drop
So they could buy a large amount for a lower price

Saw someone else complaining about bittrex on here earlier. I don't use it myself but I don't think it's just you

They'll try to control it. But it's way too speculative for them to be able to.

Traffic will slow down but they're always implementing new ways to increase the scalability of bitcoin. Just gonna take a little bit unfortunately

Paper wallet 
Not sure how it works as I'm new here but everyone seems to swear by it

I think it's become mainstream and everyone is seeing it as an easy money maker but that'll slow down and people will sell in mass which will crash the price then it'll go back to its usual rate of growth because I do think it's the future. Maybe not bitcoin itself but some other form of cryptocurrency will eventually take over

I'm not even a vet and even I'm like that. If anyone's done any research into bitcoin they know this kinda stuff is normal 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:04:14
Hopefully it leads to a few people out of the masses looking into it properly like I have :) and realising it's the way of the future 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:04:51
Even if it does dip it's still gonna rise even higher than what we are at now 
Buy now don't leave it

I have actually just downloaded mastering bitcoin :) thanks

I'm a recent buyer and a very anxious person so I'm struggling haha but this subreddit is helping keep me strong

If you're a newbie just try blockchain it's not the best but it's super easy and the app is really helpful 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:05:49
Now now haha don't be rude 
@_date: 2017-11-26 01:15:53
It's not the best but it's super easy for people new to it
And just get a wallet on blockchain
They're partnered together so you can use the blockchain app to buy bitcoins

It just had a dip but it wasn't huge 
@_date: 2017-11-25 20:23:23
I think it'll bring in a lot of new users willing to spend a lot of money so I think it'll be quite a big jump then a crash while it stabilises back to a reasonable price

Centre left????? How on earth is he left? He came out in support of the new Brazilian leader. Dave has gone full right wing which is why his subreddit has turned on him

If you really want to make money trading it's advised to wait 5 years when trading stocks. So I don't see why people never take that approach with bitcoin
