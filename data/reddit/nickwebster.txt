This was the download. Only seeing around 2 MB/s upload at the moment.

I've just thrown it on my seedbox to help out. 10 Gbps connection.

The IP space hosting the website belongs to this company 
It doesn't necessarily mean they're hosting with them although it is probable.

But whilst versions such as 0.13.0 contain the code for segwit, they do not support it on mainnet. Only 0.13.1 or higher does.

There have been a few transactions like this recently, including two with a 4 BTC fee  and

As has already been stated, this article has nothing to do with LN, although could be useful for those with a limited idea about network topology.
For your reference, light travels in an optical fibre at approximately 2/3rds the speed it travels in a vacuum. There is also some routing and switching latency (mostly negligible at around 1 microsecond per switch, and I'm not sure about routing latency).

Probably the 18th given the current hash rate trend.

Use a higher fee.

I agree that we need bigger blocks now. But in the long term there has to be more transactions than are ale to fit in the blocks to create a fee market, otherwise there is no miner incentive.

Letsencrypt is doing great things for the future of the internet and is very much compatible with the cryptocurrency mindset. Great choice!

Yes, there is no theorecical maximum, however it only grows when the network is creating larger blocks.
It solves the problem of a calendar based system changing the size in a manner that is not related to actual load.

In what way is it complicated? Conceptually, a change of 5% is quite simple. The blocksize limit should change in a way that's appropriate to the current demand.
In general, with this system the median block would be half full. This means the network is able to handle a capacity spike of 2x averaged over a fortnight.

There is no 3.56% adjustment. There is potentially a factor of 3.56 assuming every adjustment is in the same direction. I.e. 356% in the context of compound interest.

For it to increase by this large of an amount there would have to constant pressure for a year.

I adapted this idea from proposal 1 in ~~luke-jr's~~ Upal Chakraborty's BIP 106 pull request
