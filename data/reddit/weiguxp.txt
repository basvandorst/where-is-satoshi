Exactly. because of the way bitcoin is designed, one guy mining it would create the almost the same number of blocks because its time dependent (difficulty readjust according to miners. I guess the they factor difficulty when they sync the networks, so the larger network will win out.

Thats true, you can probably even carry a USB stick outside the country and sync the networks.

I think the issue is what happens ONCE they sync. The situation is the case that all parties are participating, but half the network won't see the other half. 
In which case they will both believe they are the full network and continue as normal.
But when they meet up again, bitcoin rules are such that the network with the most block chains is taken to be the "true" blockchain.

The underlying theory is also false. Whilst China does have a closed currency, there bitcoin only accounts for a few percent of the transactions in and out of the country, as there are better ways to smuggle money out of the country. 
The Bitcoin plummet back in January was mostly cost by the central bank issuing a statement condemning bitcoin and the police showing up at the headquarters of the major exchanges in china. This has been mostly resolved now.

I don't think the size reason is the only reason against BU. There were security concerns, especially after the hack. Coupled with the damage it would cause to create two coins.

I mumbled a bit there - Miners are the ones who decide to vote for segwit - to signal segwit and mine a certain number of blocks to lock in segwit.

sending the deposit sets up the account. Once the account is set up, you can send any amount that is LESS than your deposit instantly.

Just use anxpro and it saves u the trouble of getting mobbed / fake notes. They pay a premium for bitcoins anyways so withdraw fees aren't too bad
