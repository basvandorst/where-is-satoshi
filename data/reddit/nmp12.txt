Pause at 9k on july 19th, churn to the side for about five days, and then fall to 8k by July 25th. After that, who the fuck knows.

The wall is pandering to a racist segment of the population. A border wall that's actually worth a damn would cost more than more effective forms of border security. The border wall is a symbol, not a solution.

The minimum figure from trump himself is $25 billion. That’s for a steel-slat design which can be defeated with a $100 sawzaw and about half an hour’s worth of work. 
It’s a symbol, not a solution.

yes, and Kiyosaki is a scam artist. One doesn't negate the other.

There are plenty of critiques I've leveled at Apple, but that's a silly argument. Their laptops are still some of the most steady on the market, though I'll concede the 2016+ models leave a bit to be desired.

The repairability is something they really took a nosedive on after the 2012 models, I'll give you that. 
However, debating the laptops is almost silly. Apple's laptops are built to forget about. My baselevel 13" 2017 MBP plays video better than my homebuilt PC tower despite the specs being completely trounced by my box, and frankly, I don't want to worry about upgrading a damn thing for four or five years after I buy it. I just want it to get the job done, because my job isn't tech support.

My mom, who has been "afraid of that bitcoin thing" for quite some time went out of her way to send it to me, saying she finally understood what it was and why I was so interested by it.
