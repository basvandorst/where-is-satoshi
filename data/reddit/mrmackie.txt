Why could it not be hyperinflated to zero? Even if its value were not tied to USD, prices of goods &amp; services in BTC could still rise astronomically, couldn't they? I don't know the answer. I'm asking. Thanks.

And Germany &amp; Scandinavia.

Please explain. "Net neutrality" is more government domination &amp; control. No?
@_date: 2015-01-03 16:40:26


which they always will be. You can't mandate responsibility. 


You can't mandate intelligent voting either. 
You also can't mandate that the voters consider the good of the whole nation above their own material interests.

We know.
@_date: 2015-01-03 07:06:18
We could still turn it around if the voters cared and were engaged. But they're not.

Why not stay in Mexico and start your own business? 
@_date: 2016-12-13 12:33:38
I hope you're right.

Doesn't "establishment" involvement signal regulation &amp; takeover? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:04:46
Thanks, but I have looked all around that site/page, and I don't see any way to contact them. Can you point me to a way to send them a message? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:16:08
I found this link on their blog:
I submitted a request. Thanks again. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:27:55
Thanks. I did that. I didn't notice Submit a request.

I just changed all of my bank login information just in case. Does this mean Blockchain.info is and has always been fraudulent?
@_date: 2018-04-20 14:49:08
mmmmkay! I'll see what Gemini is all about.
@_date: 2018-04-20 13:35:50
OK, I guess I'll go with it. Thanks.
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:50:32
Do you sell them? Where?
EDIT: tonne - UK. Never mind, i guess.
@_date: 2018-04-10 03:44:54
Has it always been?

Maybe it could exist on its own if it became the common currency. Because, from what I understand, there is a limited supply of BTC so far. For that reason they'd be valuable &amp; prices &amp; exchange rates would occur naturally. Then people like that factory in China that can mine $1 million per month would be the wealthy and everyone else would be the poor. But then at some point after decades of mining, there would be a glut of BTC. I wonder if it would fall apart then. 
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:47:59
So it has to be tied so something else else tangible? It can't just exist on its own in cyberspace?
@_date: 2015-02-09 00:21:53
Then not everyone could have even one. They'll be using some stand-ins to represent denominations of bitcoins. They might start keeping all the bitcoin wallets in Fort Knox and issuing paper. Then they'd come up with the idea that the paper doesn't have to be backed by bitcoins . . . .

Isn't their value usually expressed in dollars (at least in the USA)? To buy them, you get so many BTC for $500. To use them, if an item's price next year increases to 100 times it's price this year in USD, wouldn't it also increase correspondingly in BTC?
@_date: 2015-02-08 18:46:28
So you'd get 1 BTC for 10 cows? 
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:42:54
They'd control the supply. They'd have the government do it. Only certain people could get mining licenses.
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:21:26
If the dollar falls and it's all you have, I hope people have time to exchange their dollars. But while that is happening, the price of BTC would be skyrocketing so you may be out of luck.
@_date: 2015-02-08 19:14:08


That's what I wasn't thinking. I'll have to think about that. It's demand that determines the value. Some currencies would be in more demand.
