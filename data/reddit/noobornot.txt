Lightcoin seems scammy. Like the creators were just trying to run off Bitcoin's popularity, like they wanted to get a head start being the first to get in - mining all the easy to get Lightcoins, and sell out to the suckers.

I don't participate in illegal activity, but this is a big deal for me. There are always those who are out to steal kill and destroy. Take what happened in Cyprus for example. If you have money... you are a target.

Any wire transfer of $3,000+ gets reported to the government.  So if you are trying to speed things up.... do less than that and wait 24 hours before you do it again.
"Yes. They are still required to keep filings for five years...transmits them to FinCEN."
 - knock yourself out...

An open source exchange. So are we talking about somehow making a P2P exchange? Could it be integrated to hookup directly into the Bitcoin network?

They probably think you are a terrorist.

Do you guys know that any wire transfer of $3,000 or more, the details gets reported to the federal government?
And if you exchange currency over $5,000 you can get reported by the financial institution with a suspicious activity report to the government.
And over $10,000 it is mandatory for them to report just about all your details and personal information to the government.... so if you are wondering why sometimes they get held up, or why banks deny it, ...just know,  there is way more going on behind the scenes than what meets the eye. - Thanks to the Bank Secrecy Act they think everyone is a terrorist....

Maybe try   they take USD. I just signed up, and will probably attempt to perform a wire transfer within the next few days. Has anyone else wired money easily with them before? They say they charge no trading fees too.
