Yep, they've been emailed. They will probably respond Monday. Just wondering if I could get this setup before that.

Thanks! That is great help and thank you for figuring out that I am using Wix and going the easy-configuration route.
I think I'm going to suggest a change in prices for the longer memberships, although it is to cover the donated books cost. I think we as a group would be fine with not making any money on this service as long as we can steadily donate books (we all have jobs too).
EDIT: Still having problems. Opened a ticket on the wix site so hopefully they can help me. Although I think they may want me to upgrade my account beyond what package we already have in order to edit HTML *sigh*

I like the idea. It would definitely help the BTC community as well as keep the donated books cost down.
If we get some support from the bitcoin community, I'll try to reach out to some of the bigger Bitcoin exchanges to ask for money towards donated books (and promote their exchange in a bookmark). Something like "bitcoin exchange X helped purchase these books through an instant online transaction. Learn more at X.com"

Don't know why you are almost downvoted to spam. It makes sense. More people who listen to EDM have dogecoins than have bitcoins

I haven't invested in it (scared to lose all my money), but fedoracoin has a coinmixer built into the wallet. A user could just continually mix their coins with the rest of the network. Any thoughts on that? Personally, I'm not technical enough to figure out how secure it is, but I want it incorporated in other forms somehow if it is useful.

"By the articles criteria it should never reach to 50 satoshi" 
Reread the article. It definitely never said that. I think you are misunderstanding the basis of what this article is saying.. It is simply describing (New coins entering the market x current cost) and DOES NOT state what percentage of these coins miners hold which is fairly essential. The coin is being devalued that much per day, although the miners are holding it until they think it is priced appropriately to dump.

Is this confirmed? If so, this is fine with me. 
I feel like some evil bitcoiners could report the losses, and not report their gains.

What's the fee on btc? Might not be feasible

Its true. This article is more for looking at a specific investment criteria rather than the big picture.
That said, I feel like this is an extremely important characteristic that we cannot overlook. If you were to invest into doge today, then for it to double in value, there would have to be enough people to bid the price up and then they would have to maintain it with 2.6 million NEW dollars every day. So, the same adoption rate for BTC has to = Doge if you expect the coin to double at this point.
My portfolio (while mostly BTC because I think it can sustain its current growth AND more), contains a large percentage of coins based on this scarcity of supply principle: Weird coins like Devcoin, Quark, and Zeta have all been incredibly stable too, as this article indicates should be happening.

I'm fucking around with you. I've seen a lot of crypto users talk about how their high supply coin is going to 10$/coin (I'm looking at Doge among others)

Probably because there's not much interest in that anywhere. People who are interested prob can get it just off an exchange
@_date: 2014-04-21 13:24:52
Why would I make that generalization? I believe it's true.
Where is my information from? Reddit users here now, and considering the average age of doges is lower. Bitcoin subscribers are more likely older and less likely to listen to edm, a genre that recently became much more popular and is targeting a younger crowd.
Relationship between edm and doge? Both are digital items held by youth. Neither of which I like

This should be at the top. Rather than "he lies about what he invests in lol mb he likes btc"

Great! I love seeing how two different communities try to solve the problem differently.
Seems like we have economists/investors on reddit and there are programmers elsewhere. Both are needed to develop

When it was 25 satoshi, the daily maintenance costs were 1/8th as high, so there's that. The article seems to indicate that Doge can't maintain its current price, while I think it may be able to maintain your 25-50 satoshi range until the block halving when it should sit closer to 100.
I don't think you can completely discredit an analysis just because you were able to make gains on a coin he says is NOW overvalued.. These are still very important statistics to measure regarding the economic models of different coins..

Do reddit tips stay in a 'system' or do they actually process every one as a transaction with mining fees?

Back in my day, that many bits would be worth $10!
