Look at Real GDP growth over the years rather than the value of a currency. Also understand that mild inflation is needed to promote spending and to push economic growth. Bitcoin can’t ever be a currency, it’ll just be akin to virtual gold, deflationary currencies lead to economic slowdown... we got off the gold standard for a reason. I find it baffling how little macroeconomics people in this community understand.

You are exactly everything that is wrong with the Bitcoin community. You used it as a get rich scheme and completely bailed out, if you truly cared about the concept you'd still keep a bit rather than selling ALL of them. You make me sick
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:43:02
Lol such a great currency...
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:43:30
This is quite possibly some of the worst reasoning I have ever seen. The people are forced to pay high fees, I’m sure everyone would rather pay lower fees

Except that this is a god damn currency and not a restaurant! I should be able to send it instantly for a penny!

The blockchain is currently roughly 470GB in size, last time I checked a 4TB hard drive and Internet that can download 10MB per second is very easily readily available. Consumer grade hardware for higher blocks is very easily attainable. I have a 4TB hard drive that I bought for 80 US dollars in my computer and have a 100Mbps connection... and I'm an average dude in a small apartment!

South Korea is a "3rd world country," last time I checked they have the best internet on the planet on average

what is so wrong with BCH? I feel like both sides conspire each other when both coins have pros and cons. Don't understand the hostility, it's so lame.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:13:55
This trolling sickens me. The wallet supports both Bitcoin and Bitcoin Cash, have you fucking even used it? This subreddit is full of horse shit sometimes, you're a moron, posts like this should be removed, it's fucking ridiculous that people like you can try and ruin the reputation of a decent app before you have even used it!
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:12:23
I'm confused, it creates both BTC and BCH? Why is everyone calling it a scam, this is the only wallet on iOS I can find that handles both?
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:40:30
There is a need for it, my transaction took 7 hours yesterday and I paid a high fee! There's several thousands of unconfirmed transactions at the moment, how is that acceptable? Bitcoin can still be a trustless digital gold if it's faster, speed does not affect its worth in my opinion 
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:04:42
Agreed. I also think the majority of people in this sub are idiots... "HODL HODL HODL TO THE MOON"... it's like they're just investing in a large pyramid scheme and don't even realise what this is about anymore. Every time I see a meme about the price a part of my soul dies
@_date: 2017-11-23 14:05:47
If you post memes about the price and keep shouting HODL then I think you're a moron

Haha damn it! I live in Tokyo now though, greatest city on Earth!

I lived in Seoul for a year! I am just being a pedantic asshole, I know the difference and exactly what you meant!
@_date: 2017-11-12 15:00:03
lol I was taking the piss out of your use of the term the "3rd world," the correct terms are developed and undeveloped countries, traditionally South Korea based on the initial usage of the term would fall into that category
Edit: as Wikipedia states, I find it offensive cause it's a term developed by western countries
@_date: 2017-11-12 14:25:54
No, cause if you are a small time miner you'd join a mining pool which doesn't require you to download the blockchain... only a full node requires it! And even if you were operating a full node the data processed in the end will be the same amount regardless of the block size... it will just process data quicker, that's how I see it
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:26:58
Can someone explain why this has been labelled misleading?
The wallet creates both, Bitcoin.com just edited the description to stop this confusion
@_date: 2017-11-11 15:00:20
You either paid a ludicrously high fee in terms of satoshis per byte, or did it way earlier in the day than now

Wow someone on this subreddit that has a brain. I salute you sir
@_date: 2019-04-02 04:31:28
would you post on the internet bragging that you have 2000 USD in your savings account?

Economies shrink under deflation? Companies lose employees? Growth shrinks? Ask any economist the damage deflation has done to Japan? Two decades of no real growth... go do some reading you buffoon
@_date: 2018-02-05 21:47:16
This is the response of a moron who doesn't understand deflation. 
@_date: 2017-09-02 11:05:55
This is nearly as bad as taking a loan and putting it on a bet in a casino... Just cause it worked out in your favour it doesn't mean in anyway you made a smart decision. I truly hope you make a horrendous loss one day so you realise that you're an idiot.

Did you guys hear about the devaluation of the Harare Dollar or the Caracas Bolivar?
@_date: 2017-10-13 04:30:29
I completely disagree... Look at Japan, they experienced deflation for decades and it halted all economic growth. Deflation is BAD! Refer to any article about deflation, there is 0 advantage for an economy having deflation. It delays spending. Think about it for one minute just think. Why would you buy a house today when you know it'll cost you less tomorrow? You wouldn't would you. 
@_date: 2017-09-27 05:09:48
This is such a TROLL!

Sorry. Edited.
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:51:20
It's not necessarily user uptake, a lot of it is investors, i.e. people just buying to use it as an investment vehicle, this by no means increases its usage as a currency...
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:51:46
Any why would I do that? That incurs transaction fees and exchange fees... Why would any rational investor and user do that?
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:50:41
I am not denying it's a good thing, however it was made to be a currency. The way it's going it's a digital gold, this cannot replace FIAT currencies due to its deflationary nature!
@_date: 2017-10-13 01:54:30
I understand what you're saying, but what is the point of doing this? What is the ultimate aim? To make it into the default currency? It's deflationary, if everyone uses just Bitcoin and nothing else, economic growth would slow down cause of deflation. The only aim I see is to increase it's price so that HODLers can make a profit from it, I see no other gain as it cannot replace fiat currencies cause of what it is.
@_date: 2018-12-04 05:08:52
No you're just delusional and want to be rich like everyone else here, otherwise you wouldn't talk about the moon or mention being down. You're a scumbag.
