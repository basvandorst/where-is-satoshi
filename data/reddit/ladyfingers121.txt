FYI This refers to Jeff Garzik's "explanation" as to why OP_RETURN should be limited to 40 bytes instead of 80: he says what you can do with 80 bytes can be accomplished with another, much more complicated implementation, and that a failure to do so is "purely intellectual laziness".
He made this comment on the [Counterparty bitcointalk forum](
This is all in the effort to prevent SPAM in the blockchain, even though 40 bytes is also enough to SPAM with.

Colored Coins cannot have a DEx on the Bitcoin blockchain.

What do you think of Transparent Forging?

I think that those edge-cases with BTC payments in decentralized exchange transactions have been solved?
Since none of the advantages you're pointing to in ColoredCoins are done at the protocol level, they can all presumably be implemented in Counterparty, as well, right?
 
Sniping in Counterparty isn't a problem because the order in which transactions enter a block isn't deterministic, and so you really can only snipe one block in advanced.
Can't the Colored Coins protocol only let you color satoshis and send them?

These are all pretty remarkable red herrings:
1. The idea that *speed* is the main thing when you are making high-value transactions is absurd: the most important thing is to eliminate counterparty risk. Both ColoredCoins and Counterparty have problems with counterparty risk when it comes to transactions involving physical items, but you at least want to eliminate counterparty risk at the digital level - which CC does not.
2. The fact that bids are done through separate communication channels is not a *feature* of colored coins, its a limitation. Counterparty can also have bids done through a separate channel, but then the reasons wouldn't be very compelling for using it (just as they aren't with colored coins).
3. Similar criticism as to (1): if your making a high-value transaction, it's worth downloading the blockchain, right??
