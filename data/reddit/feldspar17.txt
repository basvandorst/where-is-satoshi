Well, if you want straight-up bitcoin Hold 'Em in non-Minecraft form, there is always [Seals with Clubs]( BitVegas from what I've seen has a nice variety of casino games brewing though, it's nice to see.

Too high and not good. As somebody pointed out above, while the GH power is impressive, these cost around 72BTC. May or may not make that back, but probably not.

This is a great review! That's pretty fantastic. Does bitspend use MWG exclusively, or is there a wide range of online grocery services that exist? I'm not too familiar with online grocery shopping, but the fact that you can successfully do so with BTC is a very good thing.
edit: Looked more into bitspend and realized it is a generalized "pay online" website, so my question has been answered, heh.

If you don't have the money to buy bitcoins right now, and don't have any btc at the moment, how does this in any way affect your ability to have bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:17:36
I just thought this was interesting. Another article said they had about 1% of all Bitcoins, or around 100,000+.
@_date: 2013-03-26 19:24:15
Interesting - I'd not heard of CoinDL before now. You've had good experiences with payouts and everything? I think I might try putting my Android app up there, especially since their app market is so empty.
@_date: 2013-07-05 02:07:17
Seriously, that outfit HAD to be an homage. I love it.
@_date: 2013-05-20 00:36:00
I can try, but again- this is just a research paper assignment for an English course at a community college. It's not breaking any new ground, just regurgitating a few different articles about Bitcoin in general.
I just thought it was nice to see that more people are being exposed to it. :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 03:23:01
what. how do they even.. what. Every time I start having faith in humanity, I just read the comments section on any single article on any major news website and I hate everyone else on planet Earth for awhile.
@_date: 2013-07-05 02:10:30
Hahah, I've never heard that phrase. Awesome.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:23:25
You do realize (well, I'm guessing maybe not) that bitcoin is much more than just people who bought in two weeks ago and are speculating, right? And also you do realize that the price is still well over $150 per bitcoin, right?
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:01:39
Indeed. I live in the Dallas area so this is cool, but I also don't have very many bitcoins (nor do I really need a new car). Still, exciting!
@_date: 2013-03-20 16:23:12
I really don't think it's that shocking at all, considering his history championing technology.
@_date: 2013-07-05 02:09:11
That is a statement that one makes every 5 minutes walking around Austin.
@_date: 2013-04-05 15:33:08
Yay Eligius! 2.2%!
@_date: 2013-05-20 02:53:43
For the assignment, it was a good paper, and he got a good grade on it. I  was just pointing out that it's not something that is groundbreaking or would be of interest to other people. That's more of a reflection on the boring assignment I gave than a lack of effort or craftsmanship on his part.
Also, don't think he'd care all that much. He and I had a good rapport.
@_date: 2013-04-13 01:20:49
Nice. Any plans to add Stud?
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:43:09
This is a great point. Especially since it tells the recipient how much they're getting in USD (if you verify) which still draws interest of the uninitiated, but also still has that BTC in there twice.
@_date: 2013-04-17 03:23:18
This is all well and good, but I thought I would mention that I've had a terrible experience trying to sell my Android app on CoinDL. It is under "reviewing" and has been for three weeks+ now. I've regularly checked the item page  around where mine will pop up eventually (817), and it seems like the last thing they've approved was this [item]( This is pretty frustrating, as the idea of coinDL is super appealing to me, but it seems as if the admins have given up on it.
@_date: 2013-03-22 02:52:39
I, too, am curious about this purchase of HOTS for BTC. Do tell further. Also, if you are the gambling sort [SealsWithClubs]( is the best bitcoin poker room around. But, if you were just playing around on Satoshi for funsies, that's cool too. :)
@_date: 2013-03-23 14:34:03
Good point. I watch the web series they have on Yahoo, Burning Love, which is a satire of The Bachelor/Bachelorette.. and there are a large number of commenters who do not realize it isn't real.
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:17:54
Do tell me more - what happened?
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:54:59
It does! Drew from Toothpaste For Dinner (and Natalie I would hope) run a nail polish web store and they accept Bitcoin. And he's an Too bad there are no longer shirts, or I'd ask if those can be bought with BTC as well :(
@_date: 2013-04-23 00:05:51
So does that mean we should have enough pressure to get Whataburger to give me taquitos for bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-03-22 14:53:16
Ahh, right. I thought there was more to it, like hardleft had won some absurd jackpot on satoshi or something, haha.
@_date: 2013-04-15 16:46:35
This is great. All I have to sell unfortunately is an Android app I made, so I don't know that I want to open a full storefront until I have others to sell. I tried to set it up on coindl.com, but it has been over three weeks of "reviewing" my app. Very frustrating.
@_date: 2013-03-13 22:06:09
Haha. I like any website that offers EXTREME SPECIALS.
@_date: 2013-04-17 04:12:02
I tried logging into the IRC chan to see what was up, but nobody seemed to actually be at the computer. I also tweeted at them. However, apparently posting to reddit is the way to go! :)
@_date: 2013-04-17 04:13:29
Great! I'm definitely excited about trying to get my app out there (and hopefully others in the future as well). Hope I didn't come across too judgmental, I was just disappointed. :)
@_date: 2013-04-11 01:51:28
No, I'm really not. I find the crash interesting to watch, and telling about the complete worthlessness of Mt. Gox, but I'm not some scumbag speculator. I was happily aboard the Bitcoin bandwagon several months ago, when the price was a tenth of what it is now. Not so worried about any of this shit on the chart.
It seems like not so long ago when this subreddit wasn't full of armchair economists and people trying to turn a quick buck. *sigh*
@_date: 2013-05-31 17:33:28
What would be the motivation?
@_date: 2013-04-10 15:13:42
Does this mean some rich bitcoiners will pay me to write my poetry? Because otherwise, this Master's in English and Poetry ain't gonna pay for itself
