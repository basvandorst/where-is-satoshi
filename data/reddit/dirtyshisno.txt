Rewards I could see, but I just see it being pulled down at exponential rate and everyone would just blame "inflation".
What do I mean - right now lets say 100 flight points gets you 1 mile real world... well now everyone is using this different reward point so they change it to be 1,000,000 reward points gets you 1 mile real world. I don't like where this is going.

Sounds potentially flawed if it isn't backed by anything (kind of like the USD is no longer backed by gold), and so one day you can be a millionaire and the next worth nothing because the next big thing...
Kind of like myspace to facebook and then something else will come out and replace facebook. (I think facebook is already kind of dying, just nothing has really replaced it yet.)

Sounds like gambling.

Hmm, Oh so we agree it's a shit long term solution. It just seems so short-sighted.

Yeah, the thing with a website is that is fine I don't have to use it... I don't have to use imaginary crypto either but... what happens when I want to buy a car? We now have ______ car company crypto. But to exchange it has a random exchange rate and penalty depending on your crypto.
So lets take this a bit further, we have rich people crypto, poor, felon, murders, pedo, white, mexican, asain, black crypto...
So, lets say Mexicans decided fuck asains and now the exchange rate for asains to buy mexican things is outrageously high but much cheaper for white or black people.
Not saying that is how it's going to be but... you can already see this trend in every day life. Groups of people tend to act or do certain things because that is how they were raised/taught.

Why the fuck are people making so many cryptocurrencies?
It's retarded.
edit - to clarify, I think it would be dumb for every single person to have it's own currency. So, why would we want every business to have it's own currency? The point of crypto I thought was to side step the banking industry...

Having languages just to have more languages is a pathetic path forward for society. 
Standards are simple, the problem is people want to make standard one thing instead of a bunch of small standards that build into large things across all things.
It's a really simple concept.

I'm trying to understand why you would want to put value into something that can be basically worthless as value is syphoned out...

I guess, I just see it being a power play that _______ coin will be 10x btc or some noise like that.

Basically I don't like anything that the mass controls. People as a group are stupid and emotional, very generally individuals are fairly reasonable most of the time. Why would I want to be part of a herd of dumbasses?
