Personally I feel the amount of doge coin transactions will actually level that out. The inflation is not something to worry about because it will most likely match coins lost. But who knows what will actually happen, just a case of waiting and seeing.

Time the US government cracked down on TF2 Chest Keys, they're basically a currency for Steam trading and who knows what they might be being spent on!

Each coin is worth less sure but that just means you own more of them. Maybe not so great for making $$$ from investments but great for spending :)

Very likely to be using this in the near future. Good to know about.

I did this on a site just over a year ago. Worked ok then but the returns would be pretty low now.

Well this sure is interesting. Really didn't expect PayPal to head in that direction. Great if they do though, everyone has a PayPal account!

These are attributes but they're not functions. It being a currency would mean I could trade it for goods or services. It being peer to peer means nothing on its own?

What's it most useful for then? Just a 'store of value'? Is that true for all cryptocurrencies or do you think it's just a choice being made about the direction and features of Bitcoin specifically?

That advert appears to be selling how good of an investment it is. Adoption as an investment may be coming (or already here?) but stocks and shares can be a good investment and I don't buy my groceries with them.

I guess it depends what you see the biggest advantages of cryptocurrency being. I have always seen it as digital money, something I want to conveniently use as an alternative to cash. I must admit I haven't bought anything with cryptocurrency for a few years now so maybe that won't ever happen. Maybe it is actually better positioned for transferring large sums of money between rich people/entities and it's not really for people like me to use.
