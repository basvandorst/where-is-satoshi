Would it be faster if you made a program that uses the graphics card, just like... mining? :D

Well, 100 dogecoin is around 2 cents, and you can still swap that to Bitcoin frictionlessly (without using exchanges) with many services around here on the web so no worries; Shapeshift.io is one, as long as you have the changetip address ready.
Welcome to the future!

Tried and tested it; used the firefox plugin and it works with coinbase addresses. I bought Reddit gold with it using Dogecoin as the alt. Made a photo album with every step of the payment process, so enjoy!

Silly question from me, is there a way we can determine if these companies are keeping the Bitcoin and not just being processed to fiat to support this conclusion? Is they indeed are, that is a great sign.

0.5?! Let's increase some of the percentage points, shall we?

This seems to be the article in question:
EDIT: Personally, I think the fact that the possibility of you being rich in the future is what drives people to save money in Bitcoin, or otherwise. Obsessing over prosperity, sure; an addiction? You decide.

If you mean as a function of unit of account, this refers to simply money being used to indicate price, profits, costs, as opposed to say pricing every item as a basket of other items (i.e. barter trade). Suddenly, you have a sense of where you are financially as the "economic point system" gets standardized by using money. Money also enables transmission of information through price mechanisms (wisdom of the crowds, price discovery, etc.). Money then serves as an indicator of potential value (or lack thereof) in something or someone. I hope that helps.
Here's an Article that might help as it relates to Bitcoin: 
The blockchain is awesome, it remembers everything perfectly.

    1. No, this is a first.
    2. Checked your site and the premise looks good!
    3. We're gonna need a demo of some sort. Not a dislike or anything, but more like wanting to hear more.

The fact it's seriously discussed in a mainstream financial newspaper means that we've gained much more ground in the legitimacy aspect of cryptocurrency. We're winning.

France does sound nice, now that Spring is coming... :) Thank you!

Glad I could pitch in. "Placeholder" is a very apt word.

Payouts reset when I get tiles. Waste of time; it's punishing good fast players like me...
