By the way, I don't think I'm superior to anyone.  I think all men are created equal.  You're the one that implies you are inferior.
You have so little faith in yourself that you have no shame in suggesting that other human beings should carry more of the burden than you.  It's a pathetic position and it's amazing you admit it openly.
A few generations ago men would be ashamed to admit such a thing.

No, you create a tiny fraction of a job.  Do the math.  Burger $5, salary for that flipper even at minimum wage is about $30,000.  5/30,000 = 0.000166667 of a job.  Add it all up and you've created less than 1 job.  Congratulations!


Again with this B.S.  You are focusing on who should pay instead of who created the debt and how to stop creating more.  Why?  Classic democrat static view of the world.  The only possible solution in their limited imagination is more taxes despite the fact that raising taxes doesn't result in a balanced budget, just more federal spending.


Poor people hardly pay taxes, and yes, workers are who are being fleeced - not my idea.  Blame the politicians.  Again, you are focusing on other people and not the ones making the policy.  Why?


You drive a truck.  You do a commodity job that anyone with eyes, arms and legs can perform.  What were you expecting from life?  You made that choice to drive for a living, did you not?  I'm not trying to be down on you but what are you asking of yourself?  Technology is on an exponential curve and I don't think there's anything stopping it.  We're probably 10 years from not needing truck drivers in most cases.  Have you considered learning a different trade?  Plumbing is pretty lucrative and I don't see robots taking that job anytime soon.
We are in the midst of amazing innovation that is lifting people from starvation and poverty by the hundreds of millions and your answer to growing federal debt is to "tax the rich!"  "The rich" in large part are those that have accumulated wealth in as close to a free market as we've ever seen in history by adding value that others voluntarily pay them for.  You're focusing on their wealth and not the fact that in order to earn that wealth they added a proportional amount of value (aside from the much rarer cases of political cronyism, banking collusion, crime etc. - who by the way would be largely exempt from actually paying).
You're being played.  The law abiding rich pay more than their fair share.  At 30 I was paying more than the median household income in taxes and never ever even claimed as much as unemployment. The problem is not taxation, it's spending.
As for kleptocracy, who's looking to confiscate other's wealth?  I'm not saying you should have to pay.  I'm suggesting that you should probably stop short of that too and focus on those creating the problem.  The politicians pandering to people's whims (as if that formula hasn't been played out for centuries!) are the problem.  You're wasting energy vilifying your peers because they managed to make more of their life, start a business, make wise investments etc.  It's very sad.
And btw, what are you doing on a Bitcoin sub?  Bitcoin is about the free market and central banker/poltician free economy.  It's about freedom of exchange, not confiscation of the fruits of other's labor.  Is this a lottery ticket to you?  If so, you're in it for the wrong reasons.

More irony.  If there's a parasite it's the one looking to tax his peer more punitively.
You hold me in way too high esteem.  I'm just a regular guy.  If you need to elevate me to explain your failure in life, try looking inside instead.

Amazon is responsible for magnitudes more tax revenue than you because they've provided jobs.  The people employed in those jobs pay taxes, and are less likely to be a burden on other taxpayers pulling their own weight.
How many jobs have you created?
I agree politicians are largely corrupt.  Focus on them.  You've been tricked (likely by the media and politicians) into thinking the corporations are the villains when in fact corporations are just people, the founders, the board of directors, the employees and the investors - all voluntarily participating.  I've started 2 corporations and I can assure you the goal was simply to make money, create jobs and add value and I didn't need the government to do it and had no evil motivations.
Politicians are the power brokers.  Corporations are simply the buyers and in many cases it's out of necessity to thwart threats to their businesses by politicians pandering to competitors, other countries, or outright extortion.  In some cases politicians and corporations are a racket, but there'd be much less opportunity without granting politicians power and essentially immunity.
What you left out of your 1950s analysis is the growth of the federal budget and debt financing (though you do seem concerned about it but are blaming corporations).  Corporations are forced to be profitable - the government has no such standard.  I see where you're coming from but you're missing a biggest part of the picture.  IMO from the 10,000 foot view, we've seem massive expansion of the government as is evidenced by the home values in the D.C. area, literal yards of legislation consisting of millions of words, and Trillions in unfunded liabilities.
Reduce political power, allow the markets to be truly free, force a balanced budget, and we'll see the power of the private sector to create jobs and innovate, the likes which we have not seen since before 1913 with the introduction of the Federal Reserve and the IRS.

Clinging to your sole balanced budget president that happened to have a new Republican Congress he had to work with is grasping at straws.  I'm not singing Republican praises, I'm pointing out that Democrats won't ever even claim to be concerned - though maybe in that way they are more honest.
\&gt; And you seem to imply that eliminating 3 million middle class jobs from the economy for automation, would be a good idea right?
Nope, that's a straw man right there.  It's just an inevitability as went the buggy whip jobs.
\&gt; You're calling for more poor families in society, eliminating middle class jobs.
Nope, I'm calling on you realizing you do a job that almost anyone can do and you can easily be replaced.  If you want to envy the wealthy you'll have to add more unique value.  At least have respect for those that invested in their minds, innovation etc.
\&gt; You know you're right, you've convinced me taxes aren't good. So what you're saying is, I could be paying less in taxes, if Romney and Amazon's paid more, right?
Man, you're so close but perhaps cognitive dissonance has a hold of your brain too strongly.  If your wife spend more than you earn is the answer to rob the family next door or to reign her in?
Also, it's not a zero sum game.  If it were then for every "rich" person their would be more people in poverty but global trends show that is anything but the case. Despite a rapidly growing world population poverty is decreasing.
\&gt; because they're already paying a far lower portion of their earnings in taxes, than I am while making profoundly more money than me.
This is straight envy and it's ugly.  I paid as much in taxes as you earned for the whole year back when I was 30 years old.  If my % rate was lower than yours at the time, would that still be "fair" to you?  You're basically admitting that another person is so much better than you that you need to have them punitively taxed (a higher percentage of their life and labor confiscated) to make things right.  That's just unbelievably sad.  How about less taxes for all of us and less government meddling?  Your envy is so deep that you don't even want to hear that despite how obvious that solution is.
\&gt; If they truly are selfless benevolent moneyed overseers, we need lower taxes on workers, not wealthy people.
Who is "they"?  Are you expecting your peers to be benevolent while you want them to contribute more of their life to society because you are either incapable of a more valuable career, or made bad choices?  Are you a Marxist?
\&gt; Tell me if this market is so great, why are we still borrowing 4% GDP against our treasury?
I told you already, but apparently you cannot interpret the words.  SPENDING.  Did you read that?  Can you read that?  Politicians make promises to people like you that want them to have even more power over other citizens and then instead of coming through on their promises they just spend even more money.  They are professional dividers, in this case vilifying the most productive to play on your disgusting envy and earn your vote.  Apparently it works because it's easier to blame the "rich guy" than it is to be introspective about your life choices or blame your favorite politician.
Good luck in life.

Have you ever considered why there might be tax breaks for corporations?
I'll let you think for a bit for yourself to see if you can figure it out and would be happy to provide more detail.
@_date: 2019-08-04 10:01:32
Spot the error:
"Every post WWII Democratic President except Obama left office with **less debt than they inherited**."
"Gross US Federal Debt **as a Percentage of GDP**, by political party of President Debt held by the public reached a high of 49.5**% of GDP** at the beginning of President Clinton's first term. However, it fell to 34.5**% of GDP** by the end of Clinton's presidency "
"**less debt**" is not the same as "**a lower % of debt to GDP**".
You know how math works, right?  Percentages are not that complicated.
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:23:28
This is a transparent attempt to gloss over that you confused "reduced the debt" with "reduced the debt to GDP ratio."  Your statement was clear and you jumped all over mine despite your not understanding the terms.
Sadly, what you're looking for is help from your fellow citizen in a way that you don't have to be thankful or appreciative.  What you desire helps neither economic output nor the debt.  If you can't take care of yourself, you are taxing the productivity of the rest of us.
Fyi, your use of profanity only hurts your argument. Thank me later.
Btw, I and my family are all working class, no trust fund babies here.  Instead of training myself to program computers I could have chosen to drive trucks too and would still have made more than my parents earned, who by the way are doing quite nicely now thanks to being hard workers, savers and investors.  What's your excuse for being a draw on society rather than providing a surplus?  Oh right, it's those rich people.

For one, a family that doesn't allow or decide on behalf of a young child to chemically castrate them.  Also, prioritizing a father in the home, hard work, sacrifice, installment of the virtues of responsibility and the rejection of a victim mentality.
  
What's it mean to you?
@_date: 2019-08-04 21:14:11
Opinions of my character by some envious guy on the internet doesn't concern me in the slightest.  If my parents taught me to envy those around me that made better choices and worked harder to take care of themselves I'd have disowned them (had I been able to escape that ideology).  It makes me happy to see classmates that were smarter than me, or invested more in their education and have done better than I have.  They prove that hard work and dedication pays off.  This is a message I will pass to my children and can feel good about.  Sadly your parents apparently didn't impart that code to you.  They somehow taught you that envy, one of the 7 deadly sins mind you, is totally acceptable.  It's an illness, but thankfully it's also the cure.  You contaminate your stock with victim mentality that will be very hard for them to overcome.  Their failings will be blamed on others, denying them the possibility to introspect and make better choices.  Great job.
\&gt; Presumably you have a positive connotation with the words "kleptocracy, plutocracy, and oligarchy".
The irony is thick. Who's openly admitting to wanting the government to forcibly confiscate more of the earnings of the other?  You, sir.  If I had my druthers there'd be a tiny federal government and a similar tiny flat fee that we all pay.  But you wouldn't like that even if it meant a lower tax burden for you because some people that chose to improve themselves beyond the minimum would be left with more.  Equal opportunity is a virtuous moral standard.  Equality of outcome is a Marxist dystopian nightmare.
\&gt; you move the goal posts so no one balances the budget by your measure
No presidency balanced the budget since Truman.  Your % of GDP doesn't indicate a balanced budget, it just puts it in a relative context.
@_date: 2019-08-03 22:54:21
Sorry, you've been misinformed.  Please provide a citation showing a president ever leaving office with less debt than he started.  It hasn't happened since Truman. So literally no post WWII president except Truman.
Reddit won't let me link but you can google "What is the national debt year by year from 1790 to 2019" it will bring up an article, or take your pick.
Sorry to burst your bubble.  My percentage was likely higher than yours as rates are progressive and I had no dependents - it was close to 20 years ago so I don't have my returns handy.  It's sad you think I should pay more than you both in dollars and percentage.  It says something about the person you are.  I certainly don't wish people who've added more value than I have would be any further demotivated than I am.  You however see it differently.  Very sad.
All of it needs to be curtailed.  Just over 100 years ago our interactions with the government were largely limited to using the Post Office.  They've grown at an amazing pace yet despite that you want to point at your fellow man and not the ruling class.
Who get's f\*cked?  Morons that think they can vote their way to prosperity.  Either way their fucked because if their short term plans "succeed" they usher in malaise and poverty - so at least we can all be equal in our suffering.  See USSR, Cuba, Venezuela etc.

Changing a child's "gender" before they hit puberty, the new "woke" trend.
I was referring to prioritizing having a father in the home vs. nurturing a society of single mothers and disincentivizing intact families.
Regarding "victim mentality", google is your friend.  Try "oppression olympics" and "feminism".
@_date: 2019-08-03 15:05:13
Yes, politicians are largely corrupt, but "tax breaks" are clearly intended to incentivize businesses to create jobs.
Even Democrat Cuomo knows this.  Search youtube for "Governor Andrew Cuomo outlines plan for tax-free zones to spur business growth across NY".
For the most part you interact with "Corporations" voluntarily.  More wealth in corporate hands largely translates to more wealth in people's hands and out of the hands of government, with whom you do not interact voluntarily.
