Craig Wright has a busy schedule atm with his court case, where he is defending being the ceo.
Maybe we could ask the CTO, Roger ver?

Australia's middle class is actually the middle. Most people can afford it.

I think the actual idea is great. I don't think the explanation is that good, but the actual method or rather approach to perceive bitcoins as physical real world relatable objects is an excellent idea.
I think with some tweaks, or a rework of your original idea using this style and approach, could lead to me showing this to say my parents and them having some understanding. 
Which i would say would be the ultimate test of status quo understanding, given how clueless they are about technology.

You can do bank transfer, or meet in person and trade for cash. Generally a transaction will go down like this:
Organise a public meeting place. You bring agreed upon cash and the exchange rate is agreed + the commission the seller charges which varies by region but is typically from 5% to 15%.
The commission is paid generally because this is an anonymous transaction. So no one tracks you, no one knows about it, and in my eyes the price is justified for that peace of mind.
Next the seller sends the bitcoin. You wait for confirmation and then hand over the cash. (naturally you need to show that you have the cash before the bitcoin is sent.)
Once you establish a good relationship you can have frequent trades often at discounted rates with the seller.
Now depending on your country, you will have a a wide reaction from commentators. If you are in a dangerous country then this becomes a harder transaction. You will need to use your brain and exercise the appropriate safety measures to not get robbed. Meet in public places. Look for sellers with a lot of trades and high review score. Practice appropriate opsec and protect yourself.
If you are in a safer country, scandanavian, Canada, Australia etc, while these places also have scammers, criminals etc, on average your transaction is easier and chance of getting robbed goes down.
My personal recommendation when dealing with unknown sellers or buyers, is meet in public place, bring a friend or 2 with you, make sure the seller has btc ready to go, and just be cautious until you have transacted with the person multiple times.
Always use your brain. Don't explicitly trust anyone. There are a lot of scum bags in the game. But also remeber not everyone is trying to fuck you. And there are plenty (if argue majority) honest people who either want to buy or sell.

Spot on. Blacks swans happen. A little too frequently in crypto space. Fortunately for us, they go in both directions.

The Japanese built the safety protocols for their nuclear reactors in fukushima to withstand the strongest and tallest waves that had occurred in the last 50 years. It was calculated that based on history, a tsunami of over 6m height was unlikely and therfore safety protocols were designed to only withstand the historically significant maximum height of 6m.
In 2011 a tsunami following an earthquake reached a height of 14m and overwhelmed the barriers set in place for the historical threshold.
A disaster occurred.

What are you using to determine sentiment of articles?
Are you reading entire contents or judging by title alone?
Is it machine learning or other technique? And if so, which library / algo are you using.

Look, ill say one thing:
Despite him being a scamming, narcissistic piece of garbage, the fact that he is a) trying so hard b) seems to have at least some level of competence in a STEM field, and c) unironically claims to be the creator of perhaps the most revolutionary piece of technology of the last decade, is really aspirational. 
It’s highly un-Australian of him, as this is a nation of people who are fine with being mediocre and comfortable. And prefer to cut people down then to try to elevate themselves (tall poppy syndrome). 
He is really attempting to reach high, and being persistent in it. And for that I salute him. 
But on the practical side, the guy is a piece of shit and should fuck right off.

Fibonacci  and TA is a meme onto it self. Vegeta has about as much predictive ability of the market trend as Fibonacci.
