15-15-70 That's a good splitting percentage i would say. And then over the course of 10 years, buy when low again

Will bitcoin live beyond 2040?

Unfortunately I cannot agree with you. There is a reason why search engine data is valuable. It reveals what topics people are browsing and what they are thinking. Since many agree that the surge in price of bitcoin is due to CNY devaluation, there is reason to analyse what they are searching for.

Phew. I will dream of it. 100k = 1 BTC

I hope it goes to the moon but not back to earth

That's so nice of you.... Come to think of it, babies born today will be 24 in 2040. I will be really happy if 1 BTC can pay for my kid's college fees!

There is yield if we buy low and sell high. Holding at long positions have its benefits if we manage to sell it at long position. If not, money invested to buy gold and bitcoin over a long period (time = interests for real money) should be better put into something else like stocks or better lunch.

They could if they want to be drastic. 
But wealthy chinese will go to other countries' exchanges. Typically, they use a VPN, tunnel to other countries where they have a bank account, and voila, BTC for them. :-)
So instead, of letting other countries'exchanges profiting from other purchase, why not China's very own exchanges. This will still keep money within China :-) China is not stupid

No way. Unless they remove the internet

There is something called VPN which is used to pass the "Great Firewall of China"

As long as the bitcoin trading platforms are open, they can buy and sell. like huobi
