♩  blues riff   ♫
Gox took all my crypto
Now I'm leaching Wifi
Watching the price rise
Is making me cry,
Got the Bitcoin Blues
   ♬
The community is growing
For this I am glad
What once was obscure
Now doesn't seeeeeeeem so bad
But every time I see pizza
A tear fills my eye
As I get out my wallet and have to use money to buy OHHHH I got the Bitcoin Bluuuuuesss! ♬♬♫
♫ Epic Harmonica Solo ♫

This is great. 
Me and the girl are trying to live as much of our life as possible by the coin but transport has been one of those difficult to fix areas. Now we can get our flights back from New Zealand, via the US, back to London, all with bitcoin! \o.o/

It's only a matter of time until The Bank of England have to report, in dry seriousness, on Doge Coin

I got in in the end. Just that register link that was posted up doesn't work for me, but the one with .php at the end does (from the normal page)

Thanks for the info on Storj, this is indeed a part of the idea, but they've not built in any concept of 'pay to access' things and everything is encrypted, cool for backing up your files, not great for media distribution.

Had a really slow BTC withdrawal from them a few weeks ago. Took 4 days for 1 BTC.
Just started another 7 BTC withdrawal today.

I see the danger in this, but that isn't what I'm suggesting exactly. I'm saying everyone in a country would get 0.5 bitcoin a month, and in that month they'd have to spend 0.5 bitcoin on government stuff, or give it to someone who's inside the government that they trusted in.

My friend bought me tickets for a DnB concert in London, I paid him back B⃦0.20 to his blockchain.info wallet

Whowa you got some bad karma for that comment which I don't think was fair. I'm also a believer in the dangers of too much dairy products, but I need to balance this with my much stronger belief in the deliciousness of pizza. 
It's like taking a long distance flight - you know you're going to be exposed to more radiation than walking around in Chernobyl for a bit but it's just so convenient?

Is it difficult to do wire transfers from the USA to Japan or something? I don't get it.
It was pretty easy to set up with my bank here in the UK, just took 4 days with some fees (and no tx id or anything, stupid old money)

No way man they give their milk out of love. It's love milk that went into this pizza.
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:19:10
Yeah I did wonder if in the future I'll look back on this delicious food and feel bad that I spent the entire GDP of Uganda on some Indian food or whatever, but it felt good to actually eat some bitcoin.

I'm gunna sell when he sells.

I'd hazard a guess that you guys are so vulnerable to DDOS attacks as many of your API endpoints require no authentication (so no account or API key). Where are your DOS attacks hitting? Have you thought about putting all the non-easy-to-cash pages behind the authentication barrier and then putting loads of caching on the 'need to be public without authentication' pages? If an actual user account is hitting your site too much, it's much easier to block specific sources instead of everyone.

It's interesting to me that if you compare to two charts, they've very similar but the NASDAQ is scaled over years, while bitcoin is over days. Why do you think it's some time accelerated?

Just bought this curry for 0.05 BTC

Many fingers, many pies. Opening new trading accounts wherever I can is both a good de-risking exercise and makes good money. 
Kind of weird having lots of random currencies floating around that I didn't know existed before.
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:02:23
it's okay. It's vegetarian :V

Takeaway.com! Don't think they work in the US though yet
@_date: 2013-11-28 23:14:40
I still have half of it. I'll sell it to you for $10 million
@_date: 2013-04-20 22:07:23
I recon I might have meant that, yep. All these currency words are new to me still
@_date: 2013-11-17 22:31:40
Yeah I smooshed through the numbers when it came up, but I recon they have a weighted average price or whatever. I just wanted curry I didn't wanna day trade curry for bitcoin
...although that is an interested idea
