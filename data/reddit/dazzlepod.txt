The early December 2013 count (~100k nodes) is not valid as the crawler at that time took several hours just to complete one full network snapshot and it includes ALL nodes from addr responses which can be faked. Additionally, there are likely a lot of IP changes during the crawl time resulting in the depth-first search method to look for nodes in a non-unique manner.
With the new crawler released in late Dec 2013, the crawl time was brought down significantly down to sub 5 minutes with considerably good churn rate. I use the churn rate to measure how good a network snapshot is. A value of 0 implies the network snapshot was taken instantly but of course that's not possible. At the moment, we are seeing a typical churn rate of 30+:

* UP: node is currently accepting incoming connections
* DOWN: node is currently unreachable
* SYNCED: previously syncing node is now in sync with the consensus block and will begin to accept requests from its peers
* STALLED: node has stalled and does not appear to be downloading newer blocks from its peers
Up or down alert is sent for a node if its status has remained unchanged for 3 consecutive snapshots.
Synced alert is sent for a node if its previous height was 30 or more blocks away from the latest height of previous snapshot and its current height is close to the latest height of current snapshot. Ideally, these conditions should generate synced alert only for a node that was syncing large number of blocks instead of a node that is only a few blocks away.
Stalled alert is sent for a node connected over an hour ago if its current height remains unchanged against its previous height and its current height is 30 or more blocks away from the latest height of current snapshot. Stalled alert is sent at most every 24 hours.
