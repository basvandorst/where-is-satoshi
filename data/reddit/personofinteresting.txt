This is interesting!
My day rate is currently £1k/day though ($1672.25). I'm not seeing anything too comparable on there?

It was a bad joke there :s I'm not really expecting anybody to give me some super expensive bitcoin just because of IRC (or at all..).
But yeah :s

Financial independence is something I cherish (and I can be so.. which is great). 
That said, if I was handed half a million pounds... I wouldn't ever refuse that ;)
EDIT: Same with gifts. For christmas and birthdays I prefer a nice home cooked meal.. Nothing more.

I'm not after free bitcoin.
I'm also not trolling. There are much better ways to troll than this, surely?
You are welcome to your opinion.

I have no goods or services to sell, since I'm a software dev by trade.
I'm not really keen on spending £400 straight off to get a bitcoin :s I want to dip my toes a little first if possible :)

I'll try and do that tomorrow :) I have a few too many questions really.. but now that bitcin is looking stable it looks more promising than when the boom was going on last year.

* off.
At least learn to spell dawg.

Oh really? That's quite cool! I never realised that.
And thank you very much for that :) I'm not very comfortable accepting these things though mind you, so while I appreciate the gesture I'll give it a go with my own cash this week perhaps!

There's the hostility I talked about I suppose.
It was simply this:
i) If most of the community is like that.. Then so be it.
ii) Otherwise, it just flags up issues from an outsiders perspective.
