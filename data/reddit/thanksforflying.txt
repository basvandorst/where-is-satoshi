thanks for the info, I have yet to receive my withdrawal and am counting it as a loss. The help desk is far from helpful and I have yet to receive any type of satisfactory response, there is a grain of hope that I will receive my USD but its dwindling day by day.

I noticed that earlier today, however there is no option to cancel our resubmit anywhere.

It has been nearly 2 months, I would think they would have notified me and or canceled the withdrawal. Some sort of resolution would be nice

yes, another help desk ticket to no where. I wouldn't recommend using there services. I can give an update if there are any developments.

Suck they do, is it possible it can go unconfirmed indefinitely?

Got ya, thanks for the info!

will do! thanks for the reply and for contributing to the community. Im looking forward to running the bot!

so bad ass, ive been looking to get a solid trade bot. 
few questions, have you had much success with it? it appears to be fresh off the presses. What are the main features? Is it set for micro trades at .005BTC or looking for larger gaps for bigger dividends? 
Off topic, im a graphic designer looking to start a bitcoin stats site, do you know any devs who would be interested in coding such a project?
finally, fine name choice. and good luck!

Congrats! I can't seem to find anywhere to purchase them. Any advice?

got my domain and server space from these guys right before they had the bitcoin sale. great company and service!

thats what their viewers want to see. 
i wouldnt be surprised if the host leaned over after the cameras turned off and told him he did a good job. 
he gets paid to act like that.
