Don’t know about transparent but he certainly looks blurry

Why would futures bring volume if you are not buying the underlying product?
If anything it removes volume, no?

But the mobile site is horrible...

ETH will never be worth that much with all the dumping coming from the ICO's
@_date: 2017-08-28 01:23:08
I'm looking for reviews on this as well. Not a lot..

But why bitcoin when other crypto’s have taken the benefits bitcoin introduces and perfected the tech?
Only reason I see now is because it showed up first, been dragged in mud a few times and came back stronger and every time it happens more credibility it gains.
So it can be a store of value because more and more people agree it can be a store of value. If we were doing this rationally there are quicker, feeless and lighter (in terms of running a node) crypto’s out there.

And what will the next core update do?
@_date: 2017-11-08 15:45:29
Awesome, thanks.

How is it centralized? I cant find anything decent on this topic
@_date: 2019-04-19 18:56:27
I see..! No idea, though you could plug a hardware wallet of your choosing. Thanks for writing

Volume one can agree, volatility?
Doesn't inspire confidence

It's easy to hold when you see it come back like good ol 2017. This year is been a mess, some people "loose faith".
It's not that the tech has even better, all the fundamentals are solid, but all the hype brought higher forces to play
@_date: 2017-09-25 11:55:04
Why so little? O_o

Why are you singing victory already?
Fork is still coming
@_date: 2017-10-07 23:23:35
But haven't changes been introduced in core that basically will validate these S2X transactions?
That's my main concern, in the previous fork we had BIP 91 (I think) that would reject any transaction, effectively incentivizing miners not to do it.
With this fork it seems all it takes is the hash power cause the nodes aren't forcing anything 
@_date: 2017-10-08 12:49:46
Not really... I wish it was that simple.
I hope it goes like bcash, but my concern this time is we don't have any signaling like in the last time.
I really dont think S2X has any majority but I'd like to see that reflected in the nodes out there.
I just don't think it's time to let our arms down,

Not a total waste of time but I never understood how ppl expect bitcoin to survive when it reaches the cap and fees will be the only incentive.
If it's expensive now (less with segwit) imagine when fees is all miners can get.
@_date: 2018-04-28 12:24:26
Can you repeat numbers in the PIN?
I was looking at some videos and from what I understand I can only have something like 253681 but never something like 2025521
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:38:15
Unless they have more short positions, in which case you won't even get 1:1
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:29:22
Better than bitfinex
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:57:12
We will also need guides...
