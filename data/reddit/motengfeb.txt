And if it happens it will come back more high, stay happy.. ;p
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:38:04
Real resistance will be at 11k; 10900 is a cute joke.
@_date: 2018-03-31 07:38:45
It will be ok.
@_date: 2018-03-03 19:39:31
I'm proud of you little BTC, continue like that, we know it's just the beginning.
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:07:04
Was checking a bit the web, newest articles i saw about BTC are neutral +, i invit you to check it to forge your own opinion. Enjoy ;o
@_date: 2018-03-01 21:00:07
Same feeling, indeed don't like to see red but it's part of it, interesting to think about what happen next, and then.. come the green candles ! ;p
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:25:48
Will probably attack 10900 soon, volume is better too.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:22:29
Still in, will try more high.Good luck if you follow too
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:52:20
Yes, i'm waiting that too..
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:49:48
Ok, it seems it will go up earlier today, i'm in. Stay ready to seel when wave is dead in few hours.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:31:23
Sadly yes ;)
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:20:54
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:14:17
Not panic buy, but buy for the fun because want to support it, will see, anyway will hold for now and trade again in few weeks.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:18:51
Boummmm ;o
@_date: 2018-02-05 20:55:10
Be strong guys we can do it. Edit : Aaaaaaaaaaaah. Good luck
@_date: 2018-02-07 07:19:13
Be ready for a down time.
Edit ; Will probably go up a bit first ;)
@_date: 2018-02-11 14:07:25
Retreat ! :D
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:59:10
Hmmm.Nice to see what i see.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:43:57
:o !
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:30:50
On the way to break it, anyway, if it's not today will be soon muahahah.
@_date: 2018-03-12 21:32:20
Time to push it a bit.
@_date: 2018-02-12 07:49:41
I wont jump into it today, volume is lower and lower it's a massacre.
@_date: 2018-03-01 20:54:45
@_date: 2018-03-01 19:36:28
Stay positive, BTC is at his early adoption, it will pass 11k anyway.Today, or later, it doesn't really matter.All is fine with what i'm seing.:)
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:52:14
Bloodbath already happened about it..
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:20:14
Beautiful !! Heading to 9k wall :o
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:56:08
@_date: 2018-03-01 18:55:43
Ok let's be strong for the 11k now ;)
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:50:09
Zombies trying to destroy walls of an human city well defended, how does it usually finish in movies ? (It's an open question, or not :p) GL.
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:59:40
Stay strong, calm down, it's not over yet.
@_date: 2018-03-12 19:37:11
Ridiculous. Time to go up now silly Btc.
@_date: 2018-02-08 20:27:53
Not very exciting, a little wave and now fading..
@_date: 2018-02-12 20:51:34
Volume rising..Let's try to destroy shitty walls
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:21:24
It seems that our old friend want his revenge. :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:48:27
Will sell at the end of this beautiful rise it can still grow dont be too quick and enjoy.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:49:08
Lets destroy some orange wall
@_date: 2018-02-09 16:59:48
Boring. Would prefer to see it going down even if losing money instead of this, it's annoying.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:40:27
After some eggs and bacon sure :D
@_date: 2018-03-12 22:44:06
Reinforcements time brothers !
@_date: 2018-02-06 21:20:47
Totally agree with that :)
@_date: 2018-02-11 06:43:23
After the heroic fight at 8700 the same at 8000 in other way -_-
@_date: 2018-02-10 21:16:15
Wanted to buy today, but i'll wait too.Good luck.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:36:57
You know you dont especially register here before to trade and a lot of people just use new account each week, day or month.
Anyway as i said, people do what they want, it's just to give opinion.Oh it seems it's less rising.Probably lucky...Tss.Good luck all.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:02:43
I don't know, we will see ;p
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:08:18
Congratulations for the ones who didnt sell yet ;) i'm in too. Damn good fight if i can call it like that.
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:28:00
Usually when i say this it's strange but it's when it begins to go down. People are mature enough to do what they want about comments here.I see what i see that's all.
@_date: 2018-02-09 07:19:50
Hi, have a good travel in the EU train.
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:51:51
Don't care about it.It will continue to rise, let them fear the weak.
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:06:51
@_date: 2018-02-08 22:28:19
No one know, but i'm mostly waiting a down than the contrary.Will see.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:44:50
@_date: 2018-02-15 18:45:46
I hope you dont have daltonism.
@_date: 2018-02-12 21:28:15
Volume is still rising..The 1 day chart begin to be interesting too..
@_date: 2018-03-01 17:54:19
@_date: 2018-02-07 18:02:14
Some are thinking of the brutal awakening that will probably follow this rise.
I think they are right, but it can still grow a little today or tomorrow before it.
Dont be too confident, some predators are waiting in the dark to unleash their terrible sells ! Be safe and enjoy, atm it's decently rising ;)
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:00:55
Dont worry...Just hold few days/week and then trade if you want. All will be fine ;p
@_date: 2018-02-09 17:36:22
Yes, nice to see some action finally.
@_date: 2018-02-07 22:39:57
Suspens :D
@_date: 2018-02-09 23:35:12
Hm ! Edit : this sh** wall again..
@_date: 2018-02-13 17:51:29
Isn't it obvious ? :)
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:38:30
Let's break some selling defenses a bit, nice to see you strong like that guys !
@_date: 2018-02-12 23:12:11
Remember the 8700 !  We need more ! ahah
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:35:08
Nice little BTC, i'm sure you can still do better.
@_date: 2018-02-07 17:46:46
Here we go again; have fun.
@_date: 2018-02-26 22:24:51
Let's take a ride will see how long it will last :D
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:30:00
Dont forget what happen after a first rebound, and be safe to sell at the end of this run.
Its wonderful atm, still in with some of you i guess.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:46:28
Thinking same here, was just probably a little train to take, now waiting for the next one.Not optimistic about a rise now.
@_date: 2018-02-27 07:56:29
Volume continues to rise too, hmm, interesting :p
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:18:28
Too late sadly.
@_date: 2018-02-26 19:41:10
Ahahahah horrible.It seems there is a bit red color in it.
@_date: 2018-02-09 19:42:19
Fucking 8700 wall.
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:53:15
Dont know for you guys but i sold just before it stopped to rise.It's up to you now.I'll wait the next wave.
@_date: 2018-02-13 20:56:37
@_date: 2018-02-12 19:45:39
Uninteresting, tought would have been better, see you later.Stay safe..
Edit : luckily saw it :o
@_date: 2018-03-11 18:12:08
Why not :)
@_date: 2018-02-10 20:54:48
Hello all, wasnt on today, just check now, wow, it seems that i'll wait to buy today with all this red, good end of week end to all, was fun to see the good fights of yesterday at 8700 anyway.
@_date: 2018-02-10 00:03:42
Third time will be the good one ? ... If not we are trapped
Edit ; Sad
@_date: 2018-02-06 19:26:16
I think we can go still a bit higher, but not buy too late.
Edit : Stay strong we are breaking orange walls and still rising.
@_date: 2018-02-11 11:19:18
Usa will wake up soon, need your support.
Edit : sad day..
@_date: 2018-02-09 22:54:39
I see that, Thanks.
@_date: 2018-02-15 22:11:04
@_date: 2018-02-06 20:45:44
Be careful now..
