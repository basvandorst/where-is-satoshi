The first two articles are works of fiction. That is clearly stated in the beginning. They are an imagining of a situation under which Bitcoin could "fall".
I thought they were clever and creative.
Did anyone actually read them?

I was blown away to discover there is a fully functional wallet in the app store for Bitcoin. Bonus is that it is seriously the best phone wallet I have ever used. So feature rich, with a beautiful UX.
I wrote a little review for my company.
If your iPhone seriously try this thing out. It does not disappoint.
I still have the blockchain one on my phone...but I've switched to this one because it rules!

Step 1. Buy bitcoin at Thailand exchange. Here is one, there may be others: 
Step 2. Get the receiver in South Africa to register an account with South Africa exchange here: ice3x.com
Step 3. Send the bitcoin to their ice3x.com account wallet.
Step 4. They turn the bitcoin into Rand instantly on the exchange, from their account. 
Step 5. They withdraw the rand to their bank or just leave it with the exchange until they want to withdraw it.
The process should be a lot cheaper and easier then through the banks, once the accounts are set up properly at each end. That might take a day or so.
I work for ice3x.com - South Africa's exchange. I'm more than happy to assist further.
Our fees are low. So, a lot will depend on how easily and cheaply you acquire the bitcoin in Thailand. Do your homework.

I have iPhone 5 also and the QR scanner is working perfectly. Not sure what is happening there.
@_date: 2013-12-17 11:25:45
At the moment it's straight LTC/BTC/FIAT. We're rolling out a bunch of new features in the new year. That is amongst the more interesting ideas I've heard. Most appreciated. Are you based in Africa?
@_date: 2013-12-23 20:18:14

@_date: 2013-12-17 17:32:23
We welcome competition. It is healthy. Although please note that BTC China have stopped no fee trading. There fees have been reinstated. It was a brief period marketing tactic.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:32:43
Thanks. Most appreciated.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:07:00
Please explain. Where are your drawing the comparison from?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:29:15

Thanks for your mail and feedback. Most appreciated. Great idea!
@_date: 2013-12-05 01:14:16
hahaha. I was thinking a lot about how you could confiscate wealth in a world where everyone used brain wallets. Got me on to thought police...and I just ran with it.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:40:13
Tend to agree there.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:17:27
Please elaborate?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:38:19

What would you like to know?
@_date: 2013-11-02 17:25:44
It was a slight and quickly rectified over-sight. Thanks for noticing. Anyway, seems no one else was laughing.
@_date: 2013-12-19 13:39:14

@_date: 2013-12-23 19:08:46
hahaha...I'm slowly learning.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:33:32
Article for Bitcoin Magazine.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:24:44
Noted. With thanks.
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:24:50
Yeah...I agree with you. It was a deliberately provocative title. I say that in the article. Obviously the whole thing is a little tongue in cheek. It's the holiday season after all.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:21:08
That's the title. It's just a title. The article goes a lot deeper. Getting the sense I am wasting my time defending this. Everyone seems to just read titles.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:33:15
We do Bitcoin and Litecoin at the moment. Other alts are possible. But there are no immediate plans as yet.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:31:19
Please advise to which sites you are comparing our fees?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:25:58

@_date: 2013-12-17 18:05:40
I thought it was a fair question too. I am a fan of alt coins. Right now we are pleased to bring Litecoin to South Africa. There was a lot of demand for it and we are glad to deliver.
@_date: 2013-12-17 18:05:57
Will do. Is it just traded on cryptsy?
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:28:53
Thanks for your support. We're working hard to make that a reality.
@_date: 2013-12-23 17:19:38
Just to clarify, I love bitcoin (obviously). It is my life. I didn't even have any Dogecoin at the time of writing this. 
Dogecoin started life as a joke.
The article pays homage to that genesis by using a tongue-in-cheek style for a deeper analysis of how decentralised crypto-currency arrived at this point in history.
I'm guessing most people are just reading the title and not the actual piece. Or just plain missing the point. Or both.
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:41:34
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:04:24
Dude, calm down. I said it was tongue in cheek, not a joke. Don't need a lecture. I'm not a school child. I believe in everything I write and everything in this article. Although irreverent, it is still based on solid arguments. The style I choose to use for any given piece is a personal means of expression.
@_date: 2013-12-23 14:25:30
At least someone gets it. Just a tongue in cheek analysis.
@_date: 2013-12-17 17:28:25
That will change. The market is being made. Trading has started today.
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:21:02
A though piece about the broader political implications of my favourite client: Electrum. Enjoy it!
