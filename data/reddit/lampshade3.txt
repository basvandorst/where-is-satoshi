Ill try out the gold, what do i have to lose? Thank you kind sir for following through and doing this BTW, this is pretty damn awesome!
@_date: 2013-04-11 02:31:59
Yes, as far as i can tell anyways. I sold some a couple days ago, got the same amount of $$ in my bank account and it said I would when i sold them in the first place.
@_date: 2013-04-09 21:10:01
lol yep, just a little!
@_date: 2013-04-11 06:26:06
Have you emailed them? They have turned these things around quite a few times in the past, contact them, they will most likely work with you to resolve the situation.
@_date: 2013-04-03 17:50:13
I believe the other ones are backups. I could be wrong but that is what i understand them to be.
@_date: 2013-04-10 03:37:50
Wow, it is quite a refreshing change to see someone so generous!! Good on you sir/mam, good job on spreading the wealth, and happiness around!!
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:33:04
I have thought about cashing out the rest honestly, but I already paid off all initial investments into it, paid off all my other debts, so rise or fall it is all profit from here on out.
Plus you see all these stories on here about people that wish they would have bought in a few years ago, what if the same kinda thing happens, and I look back and wish i hadn't cashed out all of my coins?

@_date: 2013-04-09 18:15:52
Yea let's hope so! that would be nice!!
@_date: 2013-04-09 07:36:58
I have actually, still looking into how to actually go about giving uncle sam his cut, but i have set aside some to cover it yes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:04:49
I used coinbase to change it into $$, never had a problem with them myself.
Didn't trigger any alarms, wasnt that much $$ to begin with honestly.
@_date: 2013-04-09 06:30:26
I hope it does make it so people can breathe a little easier. Only paid it all off earlier today and it already feels like a big weight has been lifted.
@_date: 2013-03-24 07:14:59
maybe im not doing something right here, but it's almost the exact same price.. i guess i am not understanding what is making it cheaper to buy it with BTC?
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:12:52
I would of loved to do it this way as well, and keep all of my coins, but with no job i had to improvise.
Still have a decent chunk of BTC saved up, so if they do skyrocket from here, i can catch a little of the windfall :)
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:14:46
You are supposed to pay a capital gains tax if you cash them out, but only if you cash them out to your local currency, I think that is how it is supposed to go.
Still researching all the tax stuff, and how it relates to bitcoin myself, so not positive on any of this.
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:01:25
well to be quite honest, i dont know if the amounts are safe as to not garner any attention.
Either way i only cashed out ~$1000 a month. no one is beating down my door over it anyways lol
@_date: 2013-04-09 17:04:39
so i should just keep track of all money that i cashed out, like ive been doing all along, and report it next year? (already did my taxes for 2012 a while ago) 
@_date: 2013-03-21 08:06:56
Updated the site a little, added some more pizazz, and some more pools to the lists.
If you would like you pool to be added to the list, PM me the relevant info and i will add it!

Compared to some i never really racked up a huge amount of CC debt, i have always tried to only buy things if i really needed it, and if i had the cash available. 
That being said, over the last couple of years, times have been a little hard, and i had to use the CC to buy some things, I have always been paying it down slowly, but decided to just pay off the whole thing and start from scratch. 
While the "hole" i was in was never really *that* deep, it was still deep enough that as a guy with no job, i needed to get myself out of it before it could get any deeper.
@_date: 2013-04-09 15:49:34
I use coinbase to cash mine out, never had any problems with them myself.
@_date: 2013-04-09 04:49:21
Thank you! feels pretty good not to have to worry about it with all the school bills piling up

I hope so as well! Still managed to keep a pretty good chunk of BTC in my wallet, so hopefully the price keeps going up and up and i wont even need the job?.. one can only hope!!
@_date: 2013-04-03 03:19:39
There already are competitors, Litecoin, PPCoin, Novacoin, etc etc..
and doesn't competition bring about good things anyways? It is healthy for something to have competition, makes it grow..
@_date: 2013-04-10 00:14:27
lol will do.. i wouldn't take only my experience into account if you are thinking of withdrawing by the way, i only took out the above for a couple of months, didn't have much left to pay down on my CC bills.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:23:47
To be honest i just didnt want to have to worry about it anymore, as i am unemployed, i just cannot know if i can make enough to cover the payments on top of all my other bills.
One less thing to have to worry about, that is why i wanted to to do it!
@_date: 2013-08-20 18:22:50
I believe they are down for some maintenance, should be back after a while.
