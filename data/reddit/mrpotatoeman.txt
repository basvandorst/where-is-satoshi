And how is this better than Coinomi?
@_date: 2018-01-05 02:36:11
Oh ok. Since you are in your teens yourself, i presume your moms is not 50+ years old. Perhaps a generation gap. Just means i will have to dumb it down as much as i can. :3
@_date: 2018-01-10 06:13:53
Ahhh that must be it. Ok, thanks for the explanation mate. And no, Bitfinex does not have 1m option there. 1w seems to be the longest period. 
@_date: 2018-01-04 08:43:57
Care to share what materials you used to educate your parents? I may be 30 but im still just a kid to my mom, she wont take me seriously. I just want to teach her about blockchain and cryptocurrencies, she will need to learn sooner or later.

Is there a comprehensive list somewhere with ALL the forks since the dawn of time? I want to bookmark that shit so in a few years and a hundred bloody forks later i can redeem all my free fork-coins.

Thank you for the excellent explanation. I still am unable to match the OP chart no matter how much i "zoom out". His chart is just all up (and post being made 6h ago i presume the chart is also as old), there are no dips at the end. Even your own example has dips at the end. So does this mean that the OP told us all to calm down and "zoom out" by showing an old (two months) chart as an example? 
I "zoomed out" to 3y chart and this is my tail-end graph.
@_date: 2018-01-10 03:56:58
Zoom out? I dont get it. In Bitfinex i zoom out as far as i can and i still dont see similar chart. Monthly view. Confused as to what is this meant to be.

What is bitcoin dust and what is consolidation of said dust?
@_date: 2019-07-12 04:56:00
US Prez is not a fan of bitcoin? Noo... Really?? 
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:53:20




Fuck "investors" too. It's supposed to be currency, not stocks or realestate. The real users, the regular adopters - they are what matter.
@_date: 2018-01-09 08:53:21
Ah ok. That makes sense. Thank you for the excellent explanation. 
@_date: 2019-07-08 03:55:36
I never thought this response will be actually applicable but here we are - No U.
@_date: 2019-07-12 03:43:21
Authorized? lol Not theirs to authorize. The only entity to authorize these things is self and maybe wife. Nobody else has anything to do with it.
@_date: 2019-07-02 08:22:36
Because i can't take any "lambo mooner" seriously. The more of these idiots flock around bitcoin the worse it appears to normal people.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:57:03
Pretty sure the dude you replied to said so with sarcasm. He originally said that Bitcoin is not going anywhere due to its ecosystme being too large already. Pedobot asked what infrastructure and he sarcastically said that he forgot about those bitcoin ATMs and storefronts etc.
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:23:10
A Lambo appeals more to the preteens that got filthy rich from it. Bentleys are for sophisticated men, not overnight-rich kids.
@_date: 2018-05-02 07:10:09
Who the fuck is this Tosh and why should anyone listen to his Bitcoin opinions?
Google says he is just some standup comedian. In other words, who the fuck cares what he says?
@_date: 2018-05-14 05:15:21
What are all the things he keeps reaching for. I dont get it. Is that supposed to be banks paying him to make Crypto look bad?
@_date: 2018-05-29 07:40:11
Thank you for the notification. Appreciated.
@_date: 2018-05-24 07:35:40
Non. Just non.
@_date: 2018-05-21 08:04:24
Why would it troll Bitcoiners? It should trigger BCashers, not Bitcoiners because they dont like when BCash is called BCash.
@_date: 2018-05-02 06:11:08
He is not wrong though. A bit of a dickhead but definitely not wrong.
@_date: 2018-05-24 04:14:08
Looking forward to this.
@_date: 2019-11-05 05:42:33
You fucked up by announcing both your winnings and your investment. Nobody but you and your significant other needs to know about these things. Don't paint a target on your forehead for upvotes on Reddit.
@_date: 2019-11-05 06:14:54
Lol what the fuck? In my country we mark things as gifts just to avoid being taxed for no fucking reason. Need to lend a friend some money, always mark transaction as gift, so the institutions can't touch it. Sucks to be American, your country milks its people. You even have to pay tax to US if you dont even live in the country, if what i read is true. That is beyond fucked up.
@_date: 2018-10-07 13:13:54
Ive been to a cryptocurrency convention that did not accept cryptocurrency as payment for tickets. Ironic or moronic. I cant decide.
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:57:07
Kinda preaching to the choir here but ok. Thanks for reminding us. I guess.
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:08:36
Wtf is Bitcoin Core?
@_date: 2018-06-19 12:47:57
Who cares? No, thats my question.
@_date: 2018-06-18 08:28:11
Yeah, no. That shit started redirecting me to some other site. Keep your spam to yourself please.

What do retarded people unable to use a payment card, have to do with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:12:29
Fuck that noise. Most mortals dont have that money to invest. Just buy Crypto20 tokens instead. I put 500$ on it late november last year. Its my "oh i forgot i have this" fund for when i want to retire. :)
@_date: 2018-06-18 03:24:05
Some context or explanation would be nice. What am i supposed to be looking at?
@_date: 2018-06-04 04:17:48
I know right. Were we supposed to "Lolllllllll" aswell?
@_date: 2018-06-26 03:25:13
Yeah, i know. That is exactly the problem. Cryptocurrencies will never break out of their reputation if nobody uses them for what they are intended - currency.
@_date: 2018-06-14 07:48:16
Gocha. Thanks for the explanation. I have only ever heard that term coming from BCash cucks.
@_date: 2018-06-25 01:45:50
Isnt this kind of thinking counter-intuitive to growth? I understand not selling your crypto, but to just blindly HODL is to rob it of its biggest stregth - it is supposed to be a currency, not an investment asset. Spend it. Use it. Friend wants to buy a pizza? Offer to buy it for him with your crypto, he gives you the cash, you put that cash into more crypto. 
Everyday real-life use of crypto is what will make them moon, not HODLing.
@_date: 2019-02-12 08:06:06
Are... Are you retarded? Are you seriously trying to say that batteries are worse environmental offenders than combusting gas engines?
One is fucking up the environment in its intended and normal use. The other does so only if used wrong/poorly recycled or stored. I will let you guess which is which.
@_date: 2019-02-12 23:06:37
No u
@_date: 2017-11-23 04:05:26
Jokingly? Why jokingly? These things exist. Physical cryptocurrency tokens are nothing new.
@_date: 2018-03-20 09:35:27


You are talking about a dedicated hodler. Weak hands will FUD sell instead of saying "fuck it".

Linux is better than windows? In what way? It cant run 90% of my games and nobody knows how to use it. It might be better for specific work niches, has better security and stands its own but as a family computer and home entertainment center Windows is king.

Whoa, hold the fuck up.
So when i discovered that Ledger can support only 4-5 apps at a time, i was furious and demanded explanation and reasoning. The devs told me it is due to tiny (16kb if i recall correct) storage space which is intentionally tiny to limit viruses that could be installed. I was told by every asshole out there that i should be happy i can install more than one app and to get a second ledger and stop crying.
So what happened? Why all of a sudden is it possible to install 18 apps? To my knowledge software firmware updates do not expand on actual storage space.
@_date: 2018-02-07 08:00:42

Yeah, it probably is non-seg address. Thanks, i will look into it.
@_date: 2018-02-06 04:55:53
I have a ledger and a bit of Bitcoin on it before Segwit took place. Do i need to move it out, regenerate new Bitcoin wallet on my Ledger and then send my Bitcoin to the new address?

Why would this ever cross anyones mind is beyond me. Honestly. Who the fuck cares what emojis are and are not on Whatsapp. If that bothers you, i think you may need a hobby.

Are you 12?
@_date: 2019-09-22 18:35:11
Exactly. Thats because USD has been stable but Bolivares inflation is spiralling out of control. Fiat also has price fluctuations, not jus crypto you know that right?

This is gentlemen? It's not gentlemen. Its a screenshot of google search trends for keyword "Bitcoin".

Who is this Bogdanov guy anyway. His Wikipedia just says he has a twin and he grew up in France with a gold spoon up his ass. Has no mentions of Crypto. Also never mentions the lawnmower accident that turned them both into an unholy mix of Barbara Streisand and Caitlybruce Jenner.
