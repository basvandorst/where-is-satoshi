So, you will need to sign up for a Coinbase account firstly, go to coinbase.com and go through the process of registering. After your account is made you will need to have your identity verified so that you can trade on GDAX. GDAX is essentially Coinbase's "advanced" trading service, you can buy and sell bitcoin on both Coinbase and GDAX however GDAX is better in almost every way. Once you have a verified account on GDAX you can deposit your bitcoin there using the deposit options, however there is a trade limit so if you do have a *LOT* of Bitcoin it may take a while for you to be able to sell it all. If you have other questions feel free to PM me

I see... using a credit card for this is still incredibly risky though because you are borrowing money to fund an investment... which means you are going to have to pay it back eventually

Oh yeah. You people worked *real* hard making that Bitcoin price go up. Without your blood, sweat, and tears it never would have got there. Props to you, the epitome of a persevering American that pulled himself up by his bootstraps.

$8000 is a lot of money for being paycheck to paycheck, especially the ability to put all of that into an incredibly volatile asset and not have to touch it for months to pay for anything. really don’t know what to tell you. if you truly are like that i would recommend selling now so you can get a better life plan than just entirely relying on bitcoin for everything
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:56:54
Probably just other random altcoins. Bitcoin is stronger than ever though so that’s really kind of overstated, it is by far the most popular crypto and will remain so for a long time. Ethereum is pretty big as well.

It's definitely an ad hominem attack, that was your sole response to what I said there. There's no reason you can't take the time to learn it yourself.
I don't like either - but there's literally no other way to respond to that statement. It's not relevant to the argument to begin with, so it's better to just ignore it. 
But apparently, you just want to perpetuate that, so this argument is now useless. You turned it into a dick measuring contest, congrats.
@_date: 2018-01-06 17:53:50
Make a Coinbase account, then get yourself verified on GDAX using that because Coinbase is a scam fees-wise, then put all your money from coinbase onto your GDAX account and buy bitcoin from there. Put at least like $100-$200 in, otherwise they won’t let you buy. IIRC you need to get at least .01 btc. Put in a limit order rather than buying at market price since otherwise you will need to pay the maker fee.
This is a better deal than most sites because in theory if you do it right you won’t have to pay any fees at all on GDAX.

Reading this made me think of myself, except with much lower stakes... personally I come from a Mormon family and am no longer a believer, and my parents as well have refused to think bitcoin is truly valid, I haven’t been disowned or anything though and we still have a great relationship. However I am not nearly to the degree of wealth that you are as I only had a couple hundred bucks to spend on btc back in 2015 (and foolishly sold it and subsequently bought back since). I really can’t give you unbiased insight here because my situation is very different from yours but I wish you the best. As others have said your parents probably did support you despite this financially and such it seems, so they haven’t been entirely horrible despite not believing in your crypto investment. Remember to collect your BCH and bitcoin gold if that’s still worth anything, congratulations on your gains and I am sorry that your dad’s been like that, really sucks mate.
Happy new year

@_date: 2018-01-22 20:30:18


But once you get past the hump of "the people who made socialism a thing now want to stay in power", then it works out. You just need to manage a movement where after the system gets changed to socialism, the power becomes decentralized and those in power step down. Usually this will take pressure by the people. Democracy didn't work out perfectly in its few iterations either, these things take time.
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:10:59


I typically don't bother responding to ad hominem attacks, but anecdotally most of the socialists I have spoken with are actually quite highly educated. Most are working on or have already received college degrees and have undoubtedly taken these oh-so-important economics and history classes you worship.


No. Like I just said, the PEOPLE need to hold them accountable and rebel if they do not. Which is literally what any government system should be relying on (if yours isn't, you are probably North Korea).

@_date: 2018-01-01 20:14:12
I think because it is driven by supply and demand, the only way investors could artificially inflate the value is if they all decided they were going to sell all their bitcoin in X amount of days, therefore making it so there is a high demand in short term but then low demand once they start selling off, but that’s also assuming bitcoin does not grow further and see increased “real” adoption as a result of these investors.
@_date: 2018-01-07 18:36:03
Best would be an exchange. I highly recommend GDAX, because if you use it right you won’t actually pay any fees (other than the fee to send BTC to gdax over the network).

No, not sarcasm. You seriously need to read up on socialist philosophy if you think that. Even Marxists hate Democrats, they believe they are almost as bad as Republicans, just a slightly more progressive flavor. All the Democrats want are relatively small changes like better rights for minorities/gays and better social programs... communism is leagues away from what the Democrats believe in, I can guarantee you 95% of American Democrats will staunchly oppose any form of communism or socialism.

Naturally, because the use of the prefix implies that such behavior is excessive. 


So... your view here is, we need to be more concerned with America than we do other countries? What if the concerns of Americans include the welfare of other countries as well? After all, many citizens here are immigrants or have parents who were, so they may still feel ties to other countries which is something that ought to be considered.


The issue here is that you're equating something that is inherently, inextricably selfish with something that is not. Capitalism is selfish by nature. You can't change that. If you are a capitalist and you are not selfish, you won't succeed. It's just how the system works. Morality, and politics, on the other hand, should not be selfish. It should be collaborative. People should be implementing policies that benefit mankind as a whole, not the few that are lucky enough to be born rich or in the right place or at the right time (look up the "veil of ignorance" - this is very similar to what I'm talking about). This is nothing like capitalism. If everyone in politics acted 100% for their own interests and only theirs, we would be absolutely fucked. Thank God it isn't the case.

Therefore, average Bitcoin "enthusiasts" who have smaller amounts of bitcoin are more likely to be on a subreddit such as &gt;Blacks vote for the black party, the Democrats. They act in a coordinated fashion which gives them more power than their numbers entitle them to. They completely decided the Democratic presidential primary by falling into line and voting the way that their leaders told them to.
Okay... but there still is some ideological basis for them doing that in the first place. You can't tell me that all black people are just going to vote for whoever first gets to them and tells them what candidate to vote for. There's something attractive about the party's policies or ideas that makes certain people vote a certain way, people are not sheep. And plenty of black people vote Republican too, I understand you're talking about a general trend, but it's not an infallible rule.
I don't think people are currently voting strictly along racial lines. A very large portion of Americans identify as independent, which by default means they are voting for whoever matches their personal beliefs best. And just anecdotally, I voted for the "black party" as you call it even though I am not, so this isn't exactly some all-out racial crisis that it looks like you're making it out to be... I have many white friends that think similar to me as well.
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:48:01


You actually don't. In theory, if Bitcoin truly becomes what we want it to be, "getting off the train" is not necessary. You will want to stay on the train forever. If you can use Bitcoin to buy groceries, buy property, etc. then you will never have to trade it back for fiat ever again. I think this is probably what Satoshi Nakamoto is going to end up doing with his.

Perversion is relative. Everyone has their own perversions. If you think being gay is perverted, that's your opinion, but you'll have a lot of people vehemently disagreeing with you. Personally, I think a hypernationalistic attitude is a perversion of American values.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:49:12
The thing is, if you truly care about bitcoin being successful and not just an unsustainable bubble... investors looking for "easy profit" and not giving a fuck about anything else are the exact opposite of what you want. The greater percentage of those people owning bitcoin relative to the percentage of actual users, the more overinflated the bitcoin price will be. We want "real believers" so that bitcoin will be a stable currency.

Sure, nobody knows it. That's why it could be a bubble. But in theory, there should be some sort of value - according to how easily it can be used to trade things, potential for future use, etc. and that's the value of bitcoin. Is it $9500 right now in actuality? who knows
@_date: 2017-11-26 00:44:00
What’s being said in the quote you have is a logical fallacy... a price increase in USD means that USD is worth less in relation to bitcoin. You’re “maligning” that currency while stating it in terms of that price, because it shows how it is faring relatively poorly in relation to Bitcoin. There’s no other way someone can describe its worth

As we have seen, Bitcoin is definitely able to go up and down greatly within short intervals. My question is, what do you guys think is the bottom limit for the price of BTC? Let's say we had an incredibly awful panic sell, what price do you think it could not dip below without enough people buying it up to get cheap coin to make it balance out?

@_date: 2018-02-08 05:12:24


OOOooh wow. Someone had the great accomplishment of being more than three years older than me. Let me guess, you got your degree from Harvard.


What, and computer engineering would? How would you even know what's in a computer engineering degree, are you telling me you have one of those too?


Sure, but if you are focusing more on thermodynamics than how to make a computer chip, you might be doing something wrong.

2.5% is a fucking joke. I can buy and sell on GDAX for free, worst case scenario I have a taker order and pay 0.25%. This is off by an order of magnitude.

Not as dumb as someone who thinks he's Albert Einstein for getting a computer engineering degree from community college.


Hmmm... let's see...




And several more appeals to authority in a comment that seems to have been deleted by a certain pussy bitch that doesn't want to own up to his words...


Yeah, I'm sure *you* are much more accomplished than a veteran with your insecure masculinity and extensive experience as a keyboard warrior.

Could you give me an example where an open source program is less secure than a closed source one? (presuming both have a moderate amount of users, some of which are competent enough to detect malicious code)

If someone could accurately predict markets to a high degree, they wouldn't need to be trading bitcoin in the first place.
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:11:20
And sold it?
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:09:19
Bad idea. I tried that last time and it went up another $400 before I bought.
There are no such thing as “corrections” - bitcoin price fluctuation is random
@_date: 2017-10-20 23:10:01
I don’t advise this - it may never come. You are equally likely to lose or gain money on the next price movement if you buy now
@_date: 2017-10-21 21:44:05
You can't know where that point is though

This was me on the last spike. I always sell like halfway through the jump, then it stabilizes and I buy again, making me lose money on every single price increase. This is why you just hold

(Btw, I did look up the broken windows fallacy, and although it makes sense I don’t think it would always apply to this scenario)
Let’s say you have someone in a third world country that works at a factory. They walk three miles to get there every day. Although they make very little, they are currently saving to buy some sort of vehicle to cut their transit time. (I’m sure this isn’t the situation of everyone in third world countries, but I wouldn’t say this scenario is preposterous - people *do* have to work to survive)
If you gave that person 0.1 BTC, they’d now have a lot more money, and would likely buy at least a bicycle. That has driven their local economy, as well as helping that person be more productive with their labor. Isn’t that an objectively good thing? (Esp. If you compare it to someone who would buy a fancy watch instead?)
@_date: 2018-04-03 22:04:50
Ehhh. I don’t think we should be the ones to decide that.
If someone wanted to pay off my student loans I wouldn’t mind.
@_date: 2018-04-03 18:35:45
If you theoretically gave the money *directly* to someone who is starving - would that not be morally superior?
You are spending on luxuries if you have a lot of money. It does drive the economy, but that money spent anywhere would do that. If you gave it directly to someone who is destitute, they would be guaranteed to spend all that money, driving the economy, but it would arguably be spent for a better cause as they would now not be starving.
I think a payment system like Bitcoin makes this scenario all the more realistic.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:51:23


This is personally why I dislike the idea of borders in general. People should have access to stuff anywhere.
I'm just saying that I think giving money to people isn't necessarily a bad thing - as you said, it's like an investment, but if you didn't make them repay it it would be all the more better for them, because then *they* would have the option of investing that excess. If they're in a worse situation you are I think it's a relatively moral thing to do.
@_date: 2018-04-03 21:42:48
Do you think people in those countries are going to be getting loans freely though? Poor people being in debt usually doesn't work out very well, regardless of the situation. In this scenario I would imagine the interest rate would make it not a good option, it would take him a very long time to pay back on the bike and even then it might have been offset by the interest he had to pay.
@_date: 2018-04-03 17:49:41
That's a fair argument, I suppose. I do think some forms of charity are more effective than others though. In theory, if you just straight up gave some of your money to someone who has basically nothing, it would almost guarantee they would at least have somewhat of a better life.
