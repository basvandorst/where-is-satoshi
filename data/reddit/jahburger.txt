TO THE MOON

and its accomplished that for sure, but not much else. A regular person cant easily go pay rent or buy groceries in bitcoin.

damnn, well when all the  governments of the world collapse in the near future, you're going to be sitting pretty with all your bitcoins. please have some pity for those of us who are not early adopters of the coin.

hehe Im not trying to troll. Bitcoin is really interesting to me, its an awesome revolutionary idea, but at the same time it also just seems really impractical to use. This sub is full of the same bitcoin "to the moon" or "the governments gonna soon collapse" circle jerk. Lets just be real here, bitcoin after 6 years is still wayyy to complicated and impractical to use for most people in this world. And by that metric, if bitcoins true purpose is to be a currency, its kind of a failure :(

Bitcoin: the currency of choice for conspiracy theorists and drug dealers.

hehe, seems like the "value" of bitcoin has a strong correlation with peoples ability to buy drugs on the internet with it.

I do not own or have ever owned any bitcoin. I agree that thinking in terms of fiat $ is the wrong approach. I dont think bitcoin should be considered an "investment". Bitcoin is a revolutionary idea for sure, But for bitcoin to be widely utilized the vast majority of the population is looking for stability, and the ability to easily spend these coins on actual things you need to live.

It just seems like, when actually using bitcoins to buy real things (rent, food, entertainment, anything really etc), if you want to buy something you have to go thru some third party company that converts the coins into fiat for a fee of course. Remember mt gox, or all the other companies that more or less stole coins from people? Are these options really better than a bank?
