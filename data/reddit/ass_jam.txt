But Judge Peter Heywood said Lloyd's position was made worse by his previous convictions for stabbing a girl in the back with a knife and attacking a woman with a hammer as she sat in the driver's seat of her car.     Seems justified to me

shit who here wouldn't print a bunch of  free money before selling them. the name of the game is greed and were all racing to get those bit coins before the hashrate skyrockets. they are a business and their main priority is profit. 
people are just mad because they could be earning those bitcoins if they had the Asic sooner.  
@_date: 2013-04-22 14:53:31
yes be very worried

bitcoins are all digital hop on the train to paradise. ps invest your bitcoin into litecoins as mt gox admitted in an iama that they were to be trading it soon, once its on there the price should double then you trade back to bitcoins then you have 2 bitcoins :D

you are probably fine, although you can never be too sure. id risk it unless you cant afford to lose it. im also a lazy fuck and would prob just forget about it. although i dont have any substantial worth in my virtual fun money so this may influence my decision
@_date: 2013-04-15 23:25:25
that's concerning, as anytime i email them they usually get back pretty fast. i sent bitcoins to my cavirtex during the great bitcoin correction and it took 6 confirmations as the website said it would. 77 confirmations is way to many id be shitting bricks  
@_date: 2013-04-17 15:32:33
no, just no

 1 BTC Physical Bill  (BITCOINS)

its a paper wallet in the form of a bit coin bill
i think this dude is on to something

ltc is set to rise soon. the prophecy has been spoken.
@_date: 2013-04-13 07:59:31
would you please elaborate ,i don't seem to get it
@_date: 2013-04-13 08:16:17
well it seems we are all confused :D
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:35:08
its the next big crypto, its following in the footsteps of bit coin,  they are currently worth 2.50 each, they were .50 cents a few weeks ago. and they are sure too boom soon enough. btc-e.com for the stats 
@_date: 2013-04-24 22:23:39
its bullshit you are not the owner until someone buys it
, your chance of winning is not 100%, its like every other gem game you lose it after 24 hours if none buys it
fuck this site
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:28:55
why not its cheap, i gave it a go
@_date: 2013-06-17 11:15:27
you got your unit, they don't owe you shit. stop being a little pussy about it.
@_date: 2013-04-15 18:56:33
haha butterflylabs josh reference, i love it
@_date: 2013-05-04 10:46:55
haha dont worry, ive lost alot more at bitzino . just dont go back, i know its tempting to win small amounts daily then stop, unfortunately it never works
@_date: 2013-04-22 21:00:20
and its still in beta i believe, just get in touch with the creator on bitcointalk forum, im sure he'd be happy to look into it. im to lazy for my measly bet
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:15:39
shit i don't even buy songs with fiat . although this is a great idea as many people do pay for music. assuming your talking about an iTunes like program that accepts btc?
@_date: 2013-05-07 14:16:43
Bait and switch 
@_date: 2013-06-18 05:20:06
completely agree, a bunch of retards thinking the company owes them something . Avalon took the leap they deserve whatever they get. If they choose to premine or test or whatever good for them. its a rat race to riches and anyone in their position would do the same.
@_date: 2013-04-11 17:23:55
i saw it all, it was painful to watch, also a good learning experience .
now lets all reflect:)
@_date: 2013-04-22 20:59:15
i tried it to, only very small bets, from two separate addresses, nothing happened like in the try free mode and ihave no idea how to actually check my transaction. no idea if i won or lost but i got got no reaction both times
@_date: 2013-06-04 19:31:57
great idea for a website and sure its nice having them around, but they always make it our responsibility to meet their quota. It's their own responsibility to ensure their survival, not ours.  
@_date: 2013-04-29 01:46:07
i hate when people down-vote comments that speak the cold hard truth. have an up-vote:D
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:55:10
im merely investing in ltc to double my btc haha :D
@_date: 2013-04-11 09:55:42
Maintenance Over however we are now under a DDoS attack.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:59:12
hate on ltc all you want but its still the only alternative crypto with any credibility in my book.
