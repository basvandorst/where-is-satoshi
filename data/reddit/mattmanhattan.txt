I appreciate your enthusiasm about faxes and I will watch that later because of it.
Follow Up Edit: Just watched the whole thing. Wow. Really shines a lot of light on communication in general. I have a much better appreciation for the fax machine now.

Is there any way you can add something that isn't directly effected by the tip?
For example, when the tip is received, the main screen or character changes slightly to reflect that bitcoin has been sent? 
I agree that most will not pay the tip for the useful item in the game either because they don't want to or because they simply don't have bitcoin. So if you could make the 'prize' for the bitcoin tip something a little more unique that may make it a little more attractive.

They don't, but it doesn't matter. When they give these cards out they will be photographed or taken home where people can later send funds once they are back in the comfort of their wifi. 
I wrote this blog post a while ago to explain why bitcoin is so powerful, especially in situations such as these.

At the very end I subtly include a bitcoin QR code. I think this is the way people should ask for bitcoin donations in the future so that you can zap their code while watching it on your computer/TV/etc. 
I hope you enjoyed it!

It's a shame that corporations don't lead the pack, but it is even more of a shame that that is your response. 
You have a direct line to WSJ and write about bitcoin. Your focus may be as a writer and not an leader of change, but when people closest to the matter have an ambivalent feeling about it - no wonder things don't change.
