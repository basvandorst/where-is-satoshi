**The Frankeh TTM* Curve**, 2013, reddit  (*to the moon)  
  
  
Some time in 2014...   
 
Reporter: "Mr(s) Frankeh, how did you come up with this seemingly anti-logical, analytical curve that would soon change how we view economics all around the globe?"  
  
Frankeh: "See, I wanted the Bitcoin to succeed. So I rotated the downward spiral in MS paint and made little steps out of them so the Bitcoin man could use them to reach the moon. Like this.. tip tap. tip tap."  
  
Reporter: "Mind blowing, a true visionary and genius of our time. Back to you, Mandy."
