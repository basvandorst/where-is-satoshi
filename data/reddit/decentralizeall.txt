We can get organized in a decentralized way and come up with a good strategy to get rid of that cancer, if moderators have their hands tied up and cant help, we can do it on our own. This infection is getting out of control, they are literally swarming most of the posts without any positive contribution. Of course, this does not apply to the critical people against bitcoin who respectfully post their arguments, those posters are welcome, even if their opinion is opposite to mine.
