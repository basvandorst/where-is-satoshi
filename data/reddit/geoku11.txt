Nobody but the US claims Iran is the  state sponsor of terror.

There are thousands of Jews living in Iran happily, they are even in the Iraninan parlament.
ISIS, Al Qaida, Boko Haram,... all terror organizations actually have the same ideology and sponsor which is Wahhabi Salafism, a branch of Sunni Islamism, the official ideology of Saudi Arabia. Saudi Arabia, ISIS, Al Qaida, Boko Haram, they all support the exactly same ideology called Wahhabi Salafism.

You could move almost freely before the EU aswell. You just had to show your passport on the border. If you wanted to work in a foreign country you had to fill out some paper work and wait but indeed today its not much different, today you still need a new social securtiy card, change living adress, change phone company etc... so its still alot of work if you want to work somewhere else.
And this whole "working somewhere else" is very bad for alot of regions in Europe. People used to get education in there home country, and then use there craft in there region. Now many regions in Europe have turned into ghost towns as all young people go to work in England and Germany, leaving there home region to rot.

A global recession causes mass unemployment, uncertainty, defaults, people going bancrupt, unable paying for rent, food, anything. Any type of investment falls as people desperately try to scramble any money together before they sit on the streets.
Investing the remainjng money into a extremely speculative and unstable asset is the last thing on peoples mind when they need dont know to pay for frigging food and rent.
After the recession is over and the world resorts to massive money printing, then we can expect deflationary currencys like BTC, Gold and Silver to rise massively.  But during the recession itselfpeople are going to have much bigger problems then buying magic internet money. Shit is going to hit the fan.

Gold standard was removed but Gold remains, stood the test of time and is a very simple thing. Bitcoin is very complicated, people can donmany wrong things with it, easily lose it, lose access to it, difficult to store. "Beyond countries capabilities" well 70% of Bitcoin mining power is in China. Only 3 companies hold over 50% hashing power. So Bitcoin in centralized inside practicly 1 country and 3 companies. Gold never has to deal with any of these types of major issues.

He said its all based on mathmatics. But havent seen his formula.
Okay, it says first ATH was at about 1000, while the upper limit line was at 3000 at that time.
Second ATH was at 20.000, while the upper limit at that time was at 40.000.
If the next ATH also hits 1.5 year after the halving like it has in the past, the upper limit line is at 200.000, that would have the price reaching at a third of half of it if its like in the past, so next ATH between 70k and 100k.

The site was slow and unrelieable, and when I wanted to pull my holdings from the exchange, they only allowed me to withdraw a small amount each day. Other say thats pretty normal. 
In Asia a couple of weeks ago a owner of an exchange "died" and all the holdings of the exchange customers were gone, because only he had access to the keys. And should I remind ypu of the biggest Bitcoin hack in History?
I once had a problem with a Bitcoin ATM, theres a service line you can actually call and have someone to actually talk to. Try to get anybody ever on the phone from an exchange.

Going by what you say you also disagree with "hardest sound money that humanity has ever witnessed". People will just as you switch to another coin and form of money if there is enough incentive. Gold has been the hardest sound money for 10.000 years, hardfork, bugs, 51% attack or a better coin coming up makes it very unlikely 10 year old Bitcoin will be the ""hardest sound money that humanity has ever witnessed". See if its still around in 9990 years from now then the "hardest sound money that humanity has ever witnessed" comment will be true.

I like the whole paper but that sentence just reeks of emotionally invested Bitcoin nerd opinion. 
"hardest sound money that humanity has ever witnessed"
For all its greatness Bitcoin has been around for 10 years compared to Golds 10.000 years. "Sound money" endures over the time of millenias, something beeing there for a split second in terms of history can never be described as "hardest ever", during that several short time frame bugs have already completely threatened the whole network, civil Wars inside the community caused splits were its never absolutely sure which chain wins out. 
A coordinated 51% attack can end the whole "hardest money ever" immediately. 70% of miners are centralized in China hoping the Chinese Government dont suddenly turn on them and do with there equipment whatever they want. The 21 million cap can be changed if theres consensus among the miners and has alrwady been discussed in the past. Everything is subject to change in the future. Sudden 90% crash in value is been considered "normal".  Maybe a better crypto coin comes along.
Bitcoin has many great things but also alot of short commings and vulnerability venues that Gold doesnt have and will never have to deal with. The future of Bitcoin looks good but is far from certain. That one sentence you got there is ust emotionally charged, unscientific, unnecessary and untrue.

It absolutely will, and theres no way it wont happen in a deflationary money system.
In todays money system, the poor countries and poor people earn and collect inflationary fiat currency. Because of that they are never able to increase their wealth, it doesnt matter how hard or long they work, aslong as they get paid in inflationary fiat it will always lose its value. Poor people and poor countrys are like hamsters in a hamster wheel. It doesnt matter how hard they run, they are stuck in there position because all they can get for what they are doing is money that loses its value.
In a deflationary currency, like Gold or Bitcoin, poor countries and poor people can collect a currency that holds or even raises its value over time, giving everyone the opportunity to improve there wealth.

The best thing for Europe is to be decentralized, free and democratic again. Europe wouldnt be "divided", it would be diverse again. Instead of Germany funding Greece, Italy, Spain, Eastern European countrys, instead of Sweden, Germany, Austria wanting to force Southern European Countries to take up all of Arabian and African countries, instead of companies moving to the cheapest place to produce and the sending the goods tax free all over the continent, you would have instead decentralized, free and independent, sovereign countries who decide for themselfs what they want, who compete against eaxh other economicly.
Thats how Europe became prosperious and wealthy, decentralized, free and democratic, everytime they tried a centralized solution that ruled over several nations, be it EUDSSR, Hitler Germany, Napoleon or Roman Empire, it always fell apart. Its just a question of time.

Both have there advantages and disadvantages. You can have luck or be unlucky with Crypto buying and selling easily. Have the wrong QR code your Bitcoin will be gone forever, get screwed ordering something you cannot demand any Bank or anybody to send the Bitcoin back, put the coma at the wrong spot and you will send away far more value then you wanted with no way to stop the transaction. Send it to an exchange to sell the Bitcoin, they can take days to weeks to let you register, they can confiscate your Bitcoin or withhold 
 your money for any time or reason, often they dont even say a reason, customer support os often horrible in Bitcoin exchanges.

MBTC is completely confusing. Not only in speaking form, but as the value keeps rising up MBTC would be a very short lived solution. In a few years people woud say something is worth zero point zero zero zero 1 MBTC. We would be in the same situation we are now. 
Some people will keep saying Bitcoin, some will keep saying Satoshi, and then adding a third denomination mbtc and the mess is complete.
Out of conveniance and over time people would say and write btc when they actually mean mbtc, adding even more areas for misunderstandings.
I have been 3 years in crypto, everytime I hear mbtc, I have to think hard was that  zero point zero zero zero zero one? Or was it zero point zero zero zero one? You want to send me a tip? Thats zero point zero zero zero one mbtc Or was that zero point zero zero one mbtc?
Does crypto really need more confusions and making things more complicated then they already are.
A Satoshi would always be a Satoshi. Clear and simple. In Satoshis we are all millionaires. You dont want to be a millionaire?

In about 2 years from now, the end of the current bull run, bitcoin will be between 100k and 300k. 10 usd would then be 1.1 mbtc to 0.3mbtc and were right back to where we are now with the zeros infront of the coma.

The Syrian economy needs these educated people much much more then us.


Yeah because they were not getting any loans and credits from any European bank. European banks politicly conspired to not give them any loans. In other places in the world it would be a huge scandal and you wouldnt hear the end of it in the fake news media when Institutions disallow Opposition to have any funding.
And no we dont need to all be together to be "stronger". Look at the UDSSR, they were alltogether and failed, look althroughout history, creating fake uber-nationals never worked out even in places were they spoke the same language it wouldnt work out. Even Arab countries couldnt make a proper Union and it only ended in War like always when uber-nationals dont respect borders.
European countries were doing fantastic before they entered the failing EUDSSR and the Euro shitcoin that only benefits Germany. Switzerland or Norway, European countries outside the EUDSSR are doing much better.

The fake news media says that but they cant. These countries who should replace Englands payments and its funds are terribly indebted and close to complete economic collapse (to a large part because the euro which was another stupid idea that cant ever work).
The EUDSSR is NOT a democratic organisation. One does vote for the EUDSSR parliament which has no power at all instead of the EUDSSR Commission which has all the power. You know how the Commission gets together. If politicians are really bad, incompetent and do terribly bad in actual elections, they fly out of a nations politics, and get shipped to Bruessels positions of power, because there they dont have to face elections, and nobody gets to see or hear what they are doing at all. There was just a so called "election" in the EUDSSR. They completely disregarded the results of it and put van der Leyen as the winner of the election who was not even on the ballot. 
Everybody is happy in German that we got rid of her because nobody likes van der Leyen, she is completely incompetent and was never able to succeed in actual elections, just like Juncker, so the EUDSSR Elites just completely ignored the election and put her into power just to show off again how pointless it is to vote for this farce.
But we are witnessing the beginning of the end of this centralized undemocratic project which was about to make Europe an Islamic State. With right wing politicians winning all over Europe  the EUDSSR will soon be a thing of the past, decentralization, freedom and democracy will return, it is completely inevitable.

US was the most important trade partner of Venezuela, things were good in Venezuela until 1998, when they decided to remove American companies from stealing there massive Oil and Gas reserves. 
From that moment on the relation deteriated. Instability, assasination attempts, coup attempts, calls for regime change, even military plans for invading Venezuela to reestablish American companys control over its Oil and Gas industry were made.
Destroying the Venezuelan currency was just one step of the US plan. After that didnt work they added a complete boycott and sanctions, and had their allies copy that move.
After even that didnt work out the US bought a traitor named Juan Guaido and started claiming he is the new president of Venezuela. Surely he would give them back control over Venezuelas Oil and Gas.
Turns out Juan Guaido has no popular support at all.
If the US is not able to make Venezuela its servant again, you will see them even beeing ready to invade the country after making up a new excuse/false flag if necessary.

I would actually find it fair if every country who supported War in the past take in the refugees from said countries. The UK, Spain, Poland would have to take Iraqis because of there attack in 2003. France and UK having to take Syrians and Libyans because of there support for these Rebel Wars and so on. Germany should have to take Afghans and Syrians for supporting pointless Wars and boycotts.
But what the crazy Leftists and Merkel did was completely different, they wanted for all innocent European countries to take in all of Africa and Arabia and encouraged hundred thousands to jump into boats that would sink. They would disallow Syrian Air to come by plane, while at the same time encouraging masses to jump into boats that sink. Leftists and Merkel are mass murders who should all go to jail for what they have done.
If it would not have been for Le Pen, Orban, Salvini, Strache, Czech, Poland, Farrage etc. without this movement we would soon have had the Islamic State in Europe thanks to crazy Merkel and crazy Leftists have been stopped and so will there stupid EUDSSR project and the Euro which is a shitcoin that is soon going to fall.

We have seen Bitcoin has been moving like the stock market while Gold moved seperately from it. Since recession fears make the rounds Bitcoin is going sideways mostly with days swings up and down in correlation the same movement as stocks, while Gold is rising unrelated to Bitcoin/Stocks.
The US economy, job market, wages, markets... is still doing better today then it has ever done before in history.
China is having the worst year of the last 30 years, the EU is unable to generate any growth despite 0% interest rates for years, with UK leaving one of the biggest sponsor of EU project is gone and Germany who is supposed to bankroll the EU now has Deutsche Bank collapsing and is second biggest Commerzbank is in deep trouble, while growth was -0.1 % recently heading first into recession.
The only succesful economic area in the world that is doing great is the United States. China is now going to copy the United States method of using tariffs to straighten out trade inbalances and the EU commision has yesterday recommended to van der Leyen in a 173 page plan to install a EU unemployed insurance and agency and to also copy USA methods of using tariffs to balance out trade deficits.
Dr. Markus Krall economic expert expects a full recession to hit within a year, for the Euro that would mean a massive deflation at first, with people fleeing out of stocks and investments as unemployment and States debts collapse and people desperately needing there money. After a few months of deflation were stocks and Bitcoin falls hard, the EU Central Bank is going to try 'helicopter money' which means printing money like crazy to turn the Euros deflation and EU stagnation around.
Thats when people can put money in Bitcoin/Stocks etc. back again. 
How do you believe Bitcoin price will be impacted in a recession? 
The Bitcoin price is going to collapse for maybe half a year as people desperately need there money, but then as the Banks resort to massive money printing to get the economy going again the price can sky rocket.

With Bitcoin with alot of exchanges and the majority holding there Bitcoin on exchanges it is roughly the same. The Bitcoin exchanges only hold a fraction of the Bitcoin they claim to have.

I agree with the opening posts description about the childish, obnoxious, ridiculous, stupid and naive community and persons that represent Bitcoin and Crypto. What an embarassing group of people to be a part of.
Regarding the price development, if you completely zoom out, see the waves at which bear and bull markets come, it was always clear to alot of people, apart from the stupid Bitcoin spokespersons on youtube and elsewhere, that the rate that Bitcoin was recovering from the early summer was not sustainable. Just look at the graph shooting up suddenly in the early months of the bull market, it completely overshot the momentum and got too quickly too high.
All these people and institutions who wanted to buy in all of 2018 and had the patience to wait it all out for the beginning of a new bull market, which is now, jumped all in within the same few months. A slingshot effect. The price shot up like a motherfucker, as soon as the bottom was clearly behind us, that was not sustainable and now its time for a breather and a return to the mean.
If you open up the long time graph lines you knew the summer pump was not sustainable. 
If you believe in the 4 year cycle theory, we are now comparetively where we were in the fall of 2015. Look at the graphs and the last 4 year cycle. We are now half a year before the halving, a bottom was found a year ago, just as it was in 2014, now its like 2015, 2016 was the halving.
The last year before the halving and even through the halving nothing much was going on with the price. If we compare with the last cycle we should not be surprised about a flatline continue even til months after the halving. Then break ATH in a year from now, so end of 2020 would comparetively be end of 2016 where we also broke ATH. And then about a year later, and one and half years after the halving the final stage of the bull run, so end of 2017 + 4 year cycle is end of 2021.
Open up a BTC price graph that goes back to the beginning, then try to continue the patterns of the price line, continue the line of bends, turns and steep rise. You will find the period we are in now should be a boring drawn out flatline. The pump in the summer, was a suckers rally, now its back to the mean.

The EU members have started War after War and has helped create a massive refugee crisis flooding Europe. It was EU members who went to War against peaceful and stable Iraq in 2003 completely destroying the whole country setting into motion the death of over 1.5 million Iraqis as a direct result of sanctions, bombardment, invasion and a massive refugee crisis.
It was the EU who sanctioned and boycotted Libya, supported the Rebels and its members finally gave aerial support to completely bombard Libya back into the stone age, again setting into motion a huge refugee run to Europe.
It was EU who completely boycotted and sanctioned Syria into economic trouble, it was the EU and its members who supported a radical violent uprising which caused another War, and another refugee crisis flooding the EU. In this EU support for rebel chaos ISIS emerged, causing Terrorist attacks in the heart of Europe killing hundreds of people in the last couple of years.
It was the EU who supported the violent overthrow of a democraticly elected Government in Ukraine, sending another country into War after it refused to join the EU.
Now this "peaceful" EU that has sanctioned its whole neighborhood and supported War in one country after another, causing terrorist attacks and refugee crisis in Europe, considers itself peaceful thats laughable. Now they plan a EU Army so they can have the automatic support and involvement of smaller EU countries for more stupid Wars and conflicts.

Bitcoin is just another asset class that does some things that others assets cant do, so it has plenty of reasons to exists.
After currencys got off Gold and Silver standard they followed the Keynesian inflationary financial ideology, Bitcoin is also a dream comeback for those who believed in the Gold standard and the Austrian school of economics, and those who believe in a deflationary currency.
A deflationary currency can solve many problems of Capitalism. Just 2 examples.
If a currency rises in value by itself due to its deflationary setup (like Gold or Bitcoin), then spending is discouraged. You can noticenthis with hodlers. Who rather save there money because of its expected rise in value, instead of spending it on trivial things.
Why would people spend money on a new phone every year like people do in a inflationary fiat money system, if they could safe there money in a deflationary money system and then be able to buy something much better if they keep saving.
A inflationary system encourages spending, an deflationary system encourages saving.
Almost all products are beeing produced to be short lived, from washing machine, to phones to everything. This is done deliberately because in a inflationary system people have to buy buy buy and consume. Phones with irreplaceable batteries dominate the market because in an inflationary money system will buy a new phone every year.
But in a deflationary system the industries would be forced to build products that last, people would specifically seek products like phones were the batteries can be changed, were a product is made of great longliving materials, quality and longevity is the most important product attribute in a deflationary money system.
So a deflationary currency system could massively change consumer habits, how goods are produced and there longevity.
Another example of Capitalism failing, where a deflationary currency can change the world is child labor and slave labor. Many nations are incredibly poor and indebted, and poor people around the world are working in 16 hour shifts, little children have to work in horrible conditions to produce alot of the goods that we use every day.
These millions of people who work under slave conditions and the many countries who are extremely poor and indebted, are never ever able to get out of there misery. It doesnt matter how much debt they pay back or how much they try to save money to get of there misery. Because of the inflationary money system they are stuck were they are forever. 
Even if they put all the money they saved for half a year to the side, no matter how hard they try to save themselfs out of misery theres no chance. Because of the inflationary money system, everything they saved for half a year loses  almost all of its value with in a short time frame, due to the bad currencys many of the second world and third world countries have.
In a deflationary system the poor countries and the poor slaves and child labor have a gateway to coimb, because then all there work will be rewarded. Every little thing they can save through there work, not only holds its value, it even rises in value.
Millions of people living poverty around the world, think about all the slums around the world. In a deflationary money system there is a way for them to truly save money and get out of there situation. In a inflationary money system they are trapped forever. Hamsters in a Hamster wheel.

You cant say that. When interest rates are high saving money makes alot of sense, mathematicly speaking. But when interest rates are low and theres an inflationary currency system, then going into debt makes alot of sense, mathematicly speaking.
You take a 200k loan to buy a house or the like, over the long term, because of inflation rate and interest rate ypur paying back less money in terms of value, then if you would have waited to save up until you have 200k.
Saving money is losing money, getting into debt is rewarded. Thats the Keynesianic and inflationary central banking fiat money system we live in. Its an upside down system. That should not be possible and was not possible under a sound money system like Gold based or Bitcoin monetary system. But in the current financial system your losing out if you dont go into debt.

It has nothing to do with monetary or fiscal irresponsibility. The Lebanese political system is a clusterfuck in a systematic neverending gridlock that cant get any little thing done.
Lebanon is an Arab country, Christians are an endangered ethnicity in the Arab world, so they invented this nation Lebanon to give the millions of Arab Christians there own country.
After WW2 Lebanon got its independence and a political system was installed that would ensure all religious and ethnic minorities a seat and representation of power. For example the Presiden must be a Maronite Christian, the Prime Minister must be a Sunni Muslim, the Speaker of the Parliament must be a Shia Muslim, the Deputy Prime Minister and the Deputy Speaker of Parliament must be a Eastern Orthodox. This Constitutional clusterfuck was installed to represent fairly the demographic distribution.
Problem was over the years the Christians got less children then the Muslims, so after a few decades the large majority of Christians became the minority inside there own country. Kind of what will happen in Europe in a few decades.
So the shifting demographics was completely out of whack with the Constitution. With everybody voting for someone of his own ethnicity and religion to not be marginalized, the political arena moved into a decades long gridlock who cant agree on any little thing, mot even on whether trash should be picked up from the street. 
The Lebanese people together with the Syrian people have the most modern society and the most modern woman rights and status as a society by far in all of the Arab world. That they are stuck with these politicians snd constitution is a great shame.
Then you have Israel who marched into Lebanon and occupied it all the way inside Beirut not intending to ever leave and committing great massacres and genocide. The Lebanese Army beeing kept intentionally weak by international powers had no chance to push Israel back to inside its own country. So after another massacre happened a militia formed called Hezbollah who fought off Israel from Beirut and pushed Israel all the way back to inside its own country.
While Hezbollah works together with the regular Lebanese Army, you have the situation were the states official defence and power is sanctioned and weak, that a militia provides the only defense and security, also against Islamic extremist ideology like Al Qaida, ISIS and the Muslim Brotherhood. Hezbollah has become a political entity aswell that respects modern woman rights and defends Christians and other religions freedoms, they fought off ISIS and Al Qaida but since they are all Shia themselfs, supported by Syria and fended off Israel with any means the West declared them a terrorist organization, so now you also have sanctions on top of all the problems.
This Hezbollah is supported by Syria. So you not only have Israel and Syria messing with Lebanon, you also have Saudi Arabia and the Arab gulf countries spend there Oil fortune for there foreign influence.
In the civil War and Israels occupation and large bombardements hundreds of thousands of Lebanese, many of them well educated fled the country. In the illegal US Iraq invaion of 2003 more then hundred thousand Iraqi refugees fled to this small country. In the current Syria War over a million refugees went to Lebanon. Imagine your country if it would consist of 30% refugees.
Lebanon is a constitutional clusterfuck, ravaged by Invasions, bombardements, and refugees.
This country cant pick simple garbage up from the street, lack of electricity, corruption, huge influx of refugees and Israel bombarding them regularly, they have other problems then magic internet money.
I dont think theres even any Bitcoin ATM in Beirut, and no Lebanewe bank would transfer money to coinbase or something.

Having tarifs gives a people a tool to balance there import and exports just like any other person, entity or State must be able to balance there income and outcome.

Tariffs and trade wars are what boomed the economy because it encouraged many companies to move and produce in the USA again. Free trade only benefitted globalists and worldwide corporations, it allowed them to produce in slave conditions in third world countries, then ship goods three times around the world to exploite our markets.
When Trump introduced the ideology of regional production and tariffs to balance the countrys import/export trade balance in 2015, 2016, 2017, the word tariffs was almost forgotten and his whole concept of representing the desires of a nation against the globalist corporate conglomerate seemed completely alien and foreign to many. 
Soon later after the success of Trumps tariff and trade balance concept, the whole world, from Europe to South America have started to vote right wing in never seen before numbers trying to copy his success. The need for tarifs and the need to trade balance has been recognized around the world after Trump.

Yes Horses stood the test of time for thousands of years (they still are very expensive and in demand) but some day a better technology came around and horses were less used.

I know this is a hardcore Bitcoin forum, and especially Bitcoin people are often very cult like and see this all like a religion, with Satoshi as their Jesus. But things are pretty different out there in the real world. There is a great use case for Bitcoin, just as there is for Gold, Silver, real estate.

Globalism is the source of all Wars. From NATO, War against Libya, Iraq, Syria, Vietnam, Hitler, its always those who dont respect countrys borders, who think they have the right to rule over others, that nationalism ends, and Globalism starts. Hitler wasnt interested to stay inside his own borders, he wanted to rule over others, to rule the planet, he was a Globalists. If you go through History, from Napoloeon to Roman Empire, Ottomans, Mongols, every War was a Globalists War.
Leftists believe borders are bad, that world trade and free trade is good. That causes goods to be produced in places where child labor is allowed and were destroying the environment is allowed. Locally produced goods have no chance, price of proper worker costs have no chance. 1 giant container ship destroys the planet as much as 500.000 cars. Goods are beeing shipped 3 times around the whole world until it reaches you and Leftists believe thats a great thing.
From the USA, to Europe, to Brazil, South America, Russia, the world is rejecting the false song of Globalism, and is returning to regionality thinking, to nationalism, to DECENTRALIZATION.

There is a wide spread expectationin the community that people will run towards Bitcoin because of massive fiat inflation and the expected recession.
During a recession masses of people lose there jobs, uncertainty and less exposable income will pressure to put money off stock markets, bitcoin,... Think about the "dont invest more then you can lose" advice, during a recession people have less to lose then to put it into simething like Bitcoin or stocks.
Then you have the Western world not really in an inflation. Everybody expects inflation. But the EZB and the Fed have done everything they can in recent years from negative interest rates to alot of money printing to reach there inflation goals. Wih vrazy attempts they tryed to forde there goal of 2% inflation.
They cant meet it regardless of what they do. Debt is rising, and with that the obligations. Its not inflation that is the problem, they di everytging they can to raise inflation, the problem is massive debt/obligation and deflation.
All it needs is a catalyst, a country for example Italy, or a major Bank unable to pay there debt and obligations, or just a recession hitting to cause a global financial and economic crisis.
But the problem the worlds financial market is facing isnt runaway inflation, its the opposite, they cant find any money anymore, they are doing everything they can unsuccesful to raise inflation.
So the coming major crisis will be deflation, not inflation. 
If a recession hits in 2020, many companys, institutions, countrys will default, unable to lay back there debt, unable to generate profits.
But those who have lended these companys, institutions and countrys the money, have obligations themselfs they need to fulfill. So everybody will be in desperate need of money.
So the next phase in the global financial market will be sliding into massive deflation. We heard about the Fed repo and EZB printing printing money unsuccesfully in trying to raise inflation to there target. 
This massive global debt will cause a runaway deflation as everybody scrambles for money that isnt there anymore.
Only after that phase there will be hyperinflation, or a centralized digital currency enforced.
So 2020 recession starting. 2021 Runaway deflation. 2022 Runaway inflation. 2023 New World Order Digital currency enforced.
Bitcoin will need several years more to go to moon.

Free trade is great but only for the large globalist corporations. Since free trade ideology was established they have made a killing moving there companies to poor countrys were they were able to use child labor, destroy the environment, and then ship there goods over again.
Tarifs are the tools of a nation and a people to economicly defend itself, companies have been forced to produce regionally again or pay tariffs or lose access to the markets.
Free trade is the ideology of child labor, environmental destruction.
The tax cuts were for everybody, and the economy was in a terrible stalemate under Obama. They believed manufacturing jobs and booming economy would never come back to the US.

Hardwaree wallets are complicated and needs constant babysitting and updaes which so,etimes fail. If the hardware wallet server has problems and you cant uodate you are screwed and need another complicated process to rescue your Bitcoin. The current community pf Bitcoiners are very technically well versed and computer nerds, and even the majority of those people put there Bitcoins out of there control and at exchanges because its much easier then hardware wallets. The casuals who are supposed to come will do the same because storing Bitcoin is a headache even to the current Bitcoin technical crowd.


People go through borders with massive gold rings, gold watches and gold chains and gold coins all the time. You need a truck to store all your gold what are you a trillionaire?


Yeah and other times also the worst. A currency were a sudden crash of 90% in value has become considered "normal" is a problem when Bitcoin maximalists want to claim Gold is trash and Bitcoin is the only good thing in the world.


Yeah and whether Bitcoins current fork will be the best Cryptocoin 30 years from now is a wild bet, while Gold was as great as now 30 years ago, as it was 1000 years ago. If Bitcoiners feel the need to crap on other assetts, they should not become blind to the shortcomings of there own assett.


Why would miners bite the hand that feeds them? If the US, the Euro Zone, Russia and China one day decides okay guys we want to have our own currency, maybe even cryptocurrency, but centralized and controlled by us, and its time to put an end to the current system then you will see how quickly the poltiicans and the media will frame Bitcoin a pure terrorists, money laundring, human and drug trafficking tool that anybody goes to jail for having. Exchanges closing, miners raided, people put in jail and you will see the party comes to an end IF THEY WANT. Things like that are a downside of Bitcoin and Crypto.


There arent Gold forks or Silver forks. 3 types of Bitcoins are in the top 10 of all Cryptocoins. They belaughed and ridiculed BCash is holding out strong in fourth position after years. What if a stronger fork comes about. Splitting and splitting and confusing and confusing the fan. These are obvious shortfalls of Bitcoin that Gold never has to deal with. 
Bitcoin is great afterall, and we are obviously here in this forum in the centerspot for the hardcore fans of it, but a little bit more of realism anda little bit less of an emotional and almkst religious connection you guys have would be appropiate, Bitcoin isnt the only good thing in the world.

That was the best read, graphs and article I have ever read on the subject. Very well done, was a pleasure to read and think about.
I was wondering if it would be mathematicly possible to make a "probability" calculation. We are about to complete the third halving cycle. We know the time spans, the lows and highs,... is there some mahematical equation or formula that could use the data we have to make a probability calculation looking forward.
Looking at your article, with the slope of the diminishing return angle, and historicly a time of 12 to 18 months between halving and ATH, it looks like that would be somewhere between Q1 2021 and Q1 2022, with a price of between 50k and 100k.
It would be great if we could get another graph like this one:
But instead of the line/prediction of the former cycle, have a line of prediction based on the diminishing returns calculation.
Thanks again for awesome article.

Setting up a hardware wallet takes a lot longer then 2 minutes. You need to study first the in and outs of hardware wallets, the research takes days and weeks. Savely and securely setting up the devices takes hours and you need to be savy with computer. Then as Ledger has shown, putting your trust in hardware wallet manufactures can be very bad aswell as they force firmware updates that can brick your device. As soon as they want to sell you their newest product they start to brick your device and take away key features through updates. Ledger proved Hardware wallets are a bad way to store Bitcoin. Buggy software, bricking your device, failing updates, if their server dont run you cant move your coins, zaking away features as they please... There is no good way to store Bitcoin at this point in time.

Bitcoin is complicated to store securely.
Gold can be easily transport securely, 1 single kg of gold is worth over 50k$ and keep rising. Bitcoin is very complicated to transport, if fees are set to low it doesnt go through, if one single wrong letter in the adress, any hack, and your Bitcoin is lost forever with no way to get it back.
Bitcoin can be confiscated. Bitcoin has already been confiscated by the US government. Highway robbers, corrupt border guards, pirates, and others can merely kill you or make a 5$ wrench attack, then take all of your Bitcoin.
Many Cryptos have as good or better technology then Bitcoin. You never know which Cryptocurrency is going to win out in the future. Your betting on 1 horse out of thousand.
Bitcoin is complicated and dangerous to store securely.
Gold has held its value for 10.000 years, Bitcoin suddenly losing 90% of its value is considered "normal".
Bitcoin miners and its 3 biggest companies are centralized inside China, a Government which at any time is the stroke of a pen away from confiscating the majority of Bitcoin miners and 51% attack the network.
Bitcoin is in a constant state of civil War were no one knows which forks will win out at the end and what new forks in the future will win out.

Socialism quickly becomes extremely authorative as we have seen everytime in history. Socialism as a concept is based on very much strengthening state institutions. Libertarianism, right wing ideology is about strengthening the individual, somestime to the detriment of the collective. While socialism and left wing ideology is about strengthening the collective, to the detriment on the individual. Socialism with its tight grip over society and its institutions, would never allow a currency running amok like bitcoin outside its own control.

Putting your trust into the hardware wallet manufacture that cannot get his software working right and needs constant updating through there buggy server is fun and challenging. 
Crypto nerds are completely detached from reality, they cannot relate to normal people at all. Thats why this whole space is done so complicated, they think its not a problem and that everybody enjoys fiddling around with all this annoying bullshit.

Is that why after more then 10 years of constant online, tv and print media articles hardly anybody outthere in the real world owns it or understands anything about Bitcoin. 
While at the same time everybody understands and owns gold watches, coins, bars, etc.


People have given each other Gold since 10.000 years simply by giving it from one hand to another hand with 0.0seconds transaction time which can and have often been reversed for any reason.
While Bitcoin has a transaction time of sometimes up to 1 hour and is not possible to reverse the transaction unless the recipient who can be anywhere agrees.


So you dont even know that Bitcoin can be confiscated and has been many times. You live in la la land.

And in another section they directly mention BTC. 
Higher trending inflation will mean bond yields become very vulnerable, especially relative to near record (multi-century) lows apparent today. Given the near record level debt burdens around the world, it is likely that central banks will be forced to buy more securities again to ensure yields stays comfortably below nominal GDP (see our article How governments will respond to record debt). In turn, this will likely lock in higher inflation as negative real yields will eventuate, and thus very loose financial conditions and higher wages. Eventually, it is possible that inflation will become more and more embedded in our system and doubts will rise about the sustainability of fiat money. The demand for alternative currencies will therefore likely be significantly higher by the time 2030 rolls around. Will fiat currencies survive the policy dilemma that authorities will experience as they try to balance higher yields with record levels of debt? That’s the multi-trillion dollar (or bitcoin) question for the decade ahead.

At the end of the day Bitcoin is its mining companys are centralized mostly in China is still at the whim of that government, if they ever turn on Bitcoin, if the Euro Zone, USD, etc. support a move against Crypto its lights out for Bitcoin. Almost nobody wants having to do with something if its declared a crime to own, posess, vuy or selling it. Bitcoin miners anywhere can be easily stormed and raided if Government decides to do so. That is just one huge area of attack and liability, that something like Gold does not have a problem with. Gold has existed forever and will always exist, Bitcoin exists only aslong as Governments tolerate it.
Multiple forks divide the community, the apps, the whole space, nobody can give any garantees which fork wins out at the end. It can easily become a mess. Look at how pointless and stupid Bitcoin Cash is, BTC crowe promised it has no chance and will fail immediately. Years later Bitcoin Cash is still there and the fourth biggest Coin, proving any fork and any coin can become a serious challenger to Bitcoin in the future.
Bitcoin is great. But its communities constant crapping on all other forms of assetts, be it gold, silver, real estate, stocks,... just proves how childish and ignorant Bitcoin owners are and how they are blind to the obvious faults, shortcomings and problems Bitcoin and Crypto has.

I was a big Ledger shill. I loved the look, design and all around experience of the Ledger Nano S. Somedays I would even wear the Nano S on a real Silver Necklace Chain like you see rappers do in musicvideos (I'm not kidding). 
Everything was fine and dandy, me and my Ledger Nano S were a great team and everything seemed perfect. I couldnt help shilling it at every opportunity.
Then one day suddenly a new firmware Update came about. It had its own official website listing a huge list of things you have to do manually for it to work. You had to delete every single coin you had, then you had to do alot of other annoying and scary single steps. Then you had to reinstall every single coin, and after doing bunch of other stuff and having to jump threw a burning ring of fire, finally the Update process would just stall at some point.
People online were raging, people not able to update, getting something wrong allong the way, the Ledger Servers breaking down, my Nano S would just hang up at a certain point during the installment process.
My beloved Nano S went from a simple rocksolid reliable fort knox, to a fragile, questionable, unreliable, worrying brick. Weeks I couldnt access my funds and I was all up angry.
Finally I got through the Uodate, when after a couple of months another stupid firmware Update was released, not just as complicated, longwinded and unreliable to install, people were complaining all over the net, but they even took away several features of the device with this new Update.
Coincidently they had just released a new product, at the same time they released a rotten firmware update that took features away from there older product.
I thought long and hard whether to go through the same annoyance, worrying and troubles like during the last firmware update. Given that the new firmware requires Windows 10 only, I probably wouldnt even be able to install it, they bricked my device. So I decided to just never touch the Ledger Nano S anymore, I'm afraid if I switch it on they are going to force install it. So it stays digged away, I wont use it for aslong as I can possible get away with. In a couple of years maybe they will have a finished and reliable firmware version, then I will touch the device again, I'm not interested to go through the whole firmware update headache every couple of months. One day in the far future they might get it right, then I use it again.

Trump created this situation intentionally. He used controversy because the leftist mainstream news loves gossip and sensationalism. They couldnt help themselfs but to talk about him all the time. If Trump would have been nice and stayed technical, the mainstream media and the establishment would have easily ignored him just like they ignore any other candidate that isnt part of there clique.
So he used an ideology of controversy to have the leftist, establishment and there media unable to talk about anything else then him, and they believe he does that because he is dumb and a clown and a child. Thats why they underestimate him so much, which is why they lose against him on every topic.  Trump is fooling them with 4D chess all the time and they never get it.
Someone said something quite fitting about that: 
 Trump opponents never take him seriously, but they always take him literally. 
Trump supporters take him seriously, but not literally.
Add to that, that all the predictions of the leftists didnt come true about WW3 breaking out, chaos, and quite the opposite of what they believed came true. He turned the economy around to become the best it has ever been. GDP growth, unemployment rate, employment rate, wage growth, taxes, veterans are beeing taken care of, stock market records, new fair trade deals, taking control of migration, ended 70 years of Korean War, ended 8 years of Syrian War, Trump is on a winning spree the likes of which the polticial world has hardly ever seen before.
 From South America to Europe, everybody trying to copy him now and his ideology of nationalism, freedom and independence, saying what you think, is winning elections all over the world. And that makes the leftists even more mad. Its incredible. It would be nice if leftists could come down for a second and realise that all there predictions did not come true, but thats not a reason to be mad, ita a reason to be glad, and to not believe the fake news media, and that someone who might play dumb every now and then, isnt necessarily dumb, but actually very smart, who is following a brilliant tactic that is winning all the time.

There doesnt need to be a difference. 
Thats how the price of Gold got surpressed. People used to hold their own Gold aka not your keys not your Gold. Then the system switched to paper Gold, instead of giving out actual real Gold, they would give out documents that garantee that the owner of that document owns such and such amounts of Gold. Its is estimated today that the ratio 1:200 Gold actually exists, the rest is just imaginary paper gold that doesnt exist unless everybody would demand "proof of keys", "proof of gold" at the same time. Price would skyrocket if it would be exposed how little Gold actually exists compared to the Gold they claim to have.
Bitcoin is heading down the same way with the exchanges, which are like Banks. Nasdaq and exhanges they can claim to hold 100% reserves of everyones Bitcoin, but aslong as people dont cash out of withdraw there BTC all at the same time, they can fractionally reserve it ane hold just a tiny percentage of what they claim to have.

The price of Gold was very good for the last 42.000 years. Problem in this era is the same thing that is happened to Gold is happening to Bitcoin. Only 1:200 of Gold is actually real Gold. 199 of 200 Gold valie is actually just a piece of paper claiming that the owner of that document owns Gold.
If everyone who owns Gold would actually own the physical Gold, the price would be extremely high, because there isnt as much Gold around as all these fractional reserving claims. Not your keys not your Gold.
The price of Gold is very suppressed because of this. And the same is going on with Bitcoin.
The majority of people have their Bitcoin on exchanges, exchanges dont need to hold actual Bitcoins, aslong as the customer doesnt pull his stack from the exchanges it is just fake numbers on a screen. No different then fiat and banks fractional reserving. If everybody would pull his Crypto from the exchanges many exchanges would collapse or bancrupt. The Bitcoin price would skyrocket if everybody would hold his own keys.

The biggest reason for wealth inequality is the inflationary fiat money scam printed out of thin air. Research Ron Paul has written books about it, his speeches in congress and also check out his youtube channel.
The poor in the world, whether its individuals, countrys or region are not able to come out of their debt no matter how much they work or how much they safe. The inflationary money system constantly eats away whatever has been earned or safed.
Under deflationary, competing currencys, the poor have the chance to earn and safe their way up and out of the botton.

But Bitcoin must be careful to not go the same route as Gold went the last few decades. People would not physically hold the Gold anymore, they hold paper Gold, a document that claims your Bank holds your Gold.
Not your keys, not your Gold. It is estimated that only 1 in 200 of claimed Gold actually physically exist.
Bitcoin is going down the same path, people dont hold actualy Bitcoin, they let exchanges claim to hold there Bitcoin. Which arr often just numbers on a screen not backed up by anything. No one knows the actual percentage that the Bitcoin exchange really own and store in Bitcoin. Fractional reserving is happening on a wide scale in Crypto.
A Gold bank run would skyrocket the Gold price, and probably has several Banks admitting they cant deliver on all the Gold they claim to have. A Bitcoin Bank exchanges run would probably have several exchanges go bancrupt as they wouldnt be able to pay out all the BTC they claim to hold.

Setting up a hardware wallet is very complicated and scary procedure for non-tech people. Then theres the question where you put it, the keys storage, what if something happens to you, its all a big headache.
Recently my hardware wallet manufacturer (a well known one) decided to force a firmware update on everyone. It was the most stressful situation of the year going through that not knowing whether you screw something up majorly. It took so long to go through it with so much room for error steps. Then the thing hung up during the update process and wouldnt continue.
There are a thousand things to consider. Beeing your own bank is no fun. Its stressful, complicated and just a pain in the ass.
There will surely be Bitcoin Banks in the future that just take care of everything for you, where everything is stored safe and with insurance.
I know one point of Bitcoin and Crypto is to get away from Banks, but they are just so damn conveniant and safe, they should hold the Crypto for us. I'm sure there is a big market out there for this. Beeing your own Bank is a headache.

"Crypto" is a creepy word to use for the general public. Few people know what it means. It has negative insinuations, it sounds illegitimate, complicated, wicked, shady, something you would better ignore.
Use the word "Bitcoin" or "Digital Money". That sounds much more interesting and positive. "Bitcoin" sounds like making money, people think of getting rich. "Digital money" sounds fascinating, futuristic. "Crypto" something strange, boring, complicated, has something to do with hacking or computer nerds?

Your completely missing the point. 
There are 1800 new BTC mined every day. Soon it will be only 900. Relationship between supply and demand makes the price. 
A few years after it will be only 450 new BTC per day. 
9 years from now it will be only 225 BTC per day.
Think about the magnitude that is ahead of us. Going from 1800 new BTC per day to only 225 BTC per day within 9 years, with a much larger part of humanity educated about it, with the technology beeing much further ahead and more widespread.
History, not only Bitcoins history has shown what happens when you diminish the supply while demand increases.

Even a Ledger Nano S hardware wallet is complicated, once you have figured it out, they throw updates at you that take away features and are a pian in the ass to install. Firmware updates are a nightmare.

Which is exactly what they would have wanted. Hitlers NSDAP (national Socialist German workers Party) was the ideology that made him big and what they implemented. Socialism= big government, big system, state takes care of everyone from cradle to grave. Hitler and his party the national socialist were proud socialists. 


Genocidal bullshit is what the leftist globalist were promoting for decades and the exact reason why the world has turned on there bullshit ideology. The nation state remains the true foundation for happiness, harmony and democracy. Worldwide we are witnessing the end of the false song of globalism.


Exactly, which is the reason the left accepts no democracy anymore, Trump, Brexit, Brazil, Italy, Austria, Czech, Poland, Hungary,... the Left hate democracy now in this new era showing there true authoritarian centralized bullshit agenda. Trump ended 70 years of War with Korea, ended the War against Syria. Now the left have started to not only hate democracy, they now even hate peace.


Let me guess to you the Jews and Israel are all Nazi symphatisers aswell as almost all of Jews vote for right wing parties in Israel. The only brainwashed ones are the leftists. Hitler and his National Socialism party (Nazi is the german abbrevation of national-socialists) was a left wing ideology. Jews vote Right wing partys, Jews arent Nazis!

That might be what Bitcoin is to you personally. I support having Bitcoin among my portfolio because it gives power back to the people, I like digital money, hate the Euro, and most importantly support deflationary currencies. 
A nation is the foundation for a society to have representation. Without the nation state and borders, people cannot defend themselfs, there desires, there markets, there way of life, they cant have representation, they cant have diversity, they cant have cultures, they cant have democracy.
If we would already have no nations, and the Globalist system in place, we would have 1 world government, 1 world police, 1 world army. You know how easily and quickly they could end Bitcoin and replace it with a centralized shitcoin on a microchip implanted in your hand. Surveilling everything you do and say "for your own safety". This is the future the globalists are heading for.
Only the nation state is giving regions, its people the democracy, the representation that they want, need and deserve. And if necessary the military defends if there freedom is threatened. Globalism is a assured path to authoritarian tyranny. It would be very easy for the nations of the world to give away there freedom and independence to a world government world police/world army. But it would be extremely difficult to ever get it back. You can kiss your decentralized, deflationary, annonymous Bitcoin, Crypto goodbye forever if Globalism wins. How do the Globalists describe Bitcoin, as a terrorists money, a money laundering scheme, only used for crime, a ponzi scheme people need to stay away from.

Consumerism will always be there. A deflationary system rewards you if you save and hidl your money, spending money is discourage. Therefore the consumer attitude will be to buy products of great quality and longevity. New products will reflect this new desire. Great robust materials instead of cheapest plastic. Repairable and replaceable parts instead of having to buy a whole new one, etc. This goes from big things and to small things. Instead of buying cheap plastic bags every time, you buy a textile bag once and use it everytime. Instead of havkng to buy a phone every year or every second year, phones would have replaceable batterys, replaceable displays, replaceable frames etc. Longevity will be the new buzzword in consumerism.

When a company sends the products it produced over the border, they arrive at the ports, airport, etc. That is the point when the tariff toll has to be payed directly by this foreign company. They then try to pass on the rising costs to the customer, but the tariffs have been already payed by them. The native then might have a better price from a regionally produced product.
All these countrys where slavery and child work is allowed, they will always be able to produce cheaper, thats why we need tolls and tariffs, for a people, its market and its industrys to defend itself against these practises.
Since Clinton and Obama sold out there own people, the US has been running a trade deficit of 60 billion against Mexico. Mexico the jobs, industrys and money, and gave nothing in return but drugs and gangs. Only leftists think that is fair trade. Things had to change with the new USMCA trade deal.


That is what the leftists dont understand about this new zeitgeist and the world revolutionary times. All these new leaders in the world dont need to be in lockstep and to want the exact same things. He world is a very bjg place, with different cultures having different standards, desires, wishes dreams. Some want to live in capitalism, some want to live in communism, some want to live in a religious country. In this new Zeitgeist everybody is tolerated, freedom to every region to follow its own desired. As long as everybody represents his people, region, country genuinely everything is great. 
The era of leftists globalism that wanted to put the same lockstep authoritarian blanket over everybody is ending The world is rediscovering democracy, freedom and indpendence.
Among many companys coming back and reinvesting into the US following Trumps policies are
In September 2016, Ford announced that the automaker’s small-car production would exit the U.S. for Mexico, where production costs are lower. Although the move drew criticism from then-candidate Trump, the presidential hopeful met with executive chairman Bill Ford, Jr. the following month to threaten steep tariffs on Ford imports should he become president.
After Trump’s election, Ford issued a press release announcing that one vehicle slated for production in Mexico, the Lincoln utility vehicle, would continue to be manufactured in Kentucky. **“We are encouraged that President-elect Donald Trump and the new Congress will pursue policies that will improve U.S. competitiveness and make it possible to keep production of this vehicle here in the United States,”** the press release stated.
On Jan. 3, 2017, Ford announced plans to cancel a new $1.6 billion plant planned in San Luis Potosi, Mexico. Opting not to relocate production outside of the country saved approximately 3,500 U.S. jobs, according to a Ford press release. Instead, 700 additional new jobs will be created from a $700 million expansion of a Michigan plant focused on building high-tech electric and autonomous vehicles along with the Lincoln Continental and Mustang.
In June 2017, Ford announced that it would move its U.S. production of the Ford Focus to China in 2019 without causing a loss of U.S. jobs. Ford already makes the Focus in China for Chinese buyers. But by September 2018, Ford had changed its plans to import the small car to the U.S. from China due to the expense of import tariffs that the Trump administration implemented in July.
Dow Chemical
At Trump’s post-election victory rally in Grand Rapids, Mich., on Dec. 9, 2016, the spotlight wasn’t just on the President-elect. Dow Chemical’s Chairman and CEO Andrew Liveris announced the company was bringing jobs to the Great Lake State.
The CEO took the stage to describe the company’s’ more than 100-year history in Midland. “We aren’t stopping there,” Liveris said at the rally. **“Tonight, in honor of the President-elect and his being here to thank you all, we’ve made a decision.”**
Liveris described the new state-of-the-art center that will add several hundred jobs to the 7,000 Dow already provides in the community. “We’re going to use American hard work and American brains,” said Liveris. The center will bring 100 jobs to Midland, plus restore 100 lost to foreign operations.
It’s likely that the Jumbotron you’re watching at the stadium was made by Trans-Lux. The manufacturer of LED digital displays and lighting planned to eventually bring its Chinese production facilities back to the U.S. However, Trump’s promises of tariffs on products manufactured in other countries sped up the move, according to the company’s website.
For the past two decades, the company has manufactured much of its products in Shenzhen in Southeast China. As China’s business economy grew, expenses for labor and shipping increased, triggering the company’s plan for an eventual move back to America.
Trans-Lux announced it was “getting ahead of the curve” by shifting more of its production to the U.S. on Dec. 7, 2016. On Jan. 6, 2017, it announced its intent to move 100 percent of its manufacturing to the U.S.
The company pledged to move the majority, if not all, of its China operations into a leased warehouse in Hazelwood, Mo. The move includes a $650,000 forgivable loan from the city of Hazelwood. Trans-Lux reported the facility will employ 90 people within four years. The company also stated that one of the two operations of the company’s Fair-Play division, housed in a 68,000-square-foot plant in Des Moines, Iowa, was also set to move to Hazelwood.
Although telecommunications company Sprint has its roots firmly planted in American soil, 84.94 percent of its shares belong to the Japanese company SoftBank.
But that didn’t stop President-elect Donald Trump from negotiating returning jobs to American soil with Masayoshi Son, the billionaire chairman of Sprint and SoftBank’s CEO. After a private meeting on Dec. 7,  2016, the mogul pledged to create 50,000 new American jobs and invest $50 billion in the U.S.
On Dec. 28, 2016, Sprint issued a news release announcing its commitment to bring back or create 5,000 American jobs in 2017. In January of 2017, Sprint announced the creation of 100 new jobs at subsidiary Virgin Mobile’s headquarters in Kansas City, Mo., by summer.
**“We are excited to work with President-elect Trump and his administration to do our part to drive economic growth and create jobs in the U.S.,”** Sprint CEO Marcelo Claure said in the company’s press release. “We believe it is critical for business and government to partner together to create more job opportunities in the U.S. and ensure prosperity for all Americans.”
General Motors Company
General Motors Company produces vehicles on six continents, but its history began in America. Shortly after Trump won the election, the company issued a congratulatory press release affirming its commitment to support the U.S. manufacturing industry.
**“GM looks forward to working with President-elect Donald J. Trump and the new Congress on policies that support a strong and competitive U.S. manufacturing base. GM will continue to do its part to transform the future of mobility, in America and around the world.”**
The day following the election, General Motors announced a $900 million investment in an upgrade to facilities in Ohio, Michigan and Indiana for future product programs.
On Jan. 17, 2017, just a few days before the inauguration, GM announced a $1 billion additional investment in U.S. manufacturing operations on top of the $2.9 billion in commitments the company made in 2016. The projects will create or retain 1,500 jobs and develop advanced technology, automobile components and new vehicles.
On Feb. 10, 2016, HVAC manufacturing giant Carrier announced its intent to move 1,400 jobs from its Indianapolis factory to Mexico. The move was set to begin in 2017 and fully transition jobs south of the border by 2019.
Video of the announcement captured by a worker hit social media. Then-presidential candidate Donald Trump seized the event during his campaign as a central example of how Americans lose jobs to foreign countries.
Trump later didn’t remember saying the words, “Carrier will never leave,” during his campaign rhetoric. Watching a nightly news show profiling Carrier a few weeks after the election, Trump realized people who were hearing his words were counting on him to keep his promise.
The president then began negotiations with Carrier by picking up the phone and dialing Greg Hayes, chairman of United Technologies, Carrier’s parent company. Subsequent negotiations resulted in 1,100 jobs remaining in the U.S. Perks for Carrier to stay included $7 million in training grants and conditional tax credits over the next 10 years.
International Business Machines, commonly known as IBM, has roots in the U.S. going back as far as 1888. By 1914, the company lived up to the “international” part of its name, with operations expanding from the U.S to Asia, South America, Europe and Australia.
By 2007 — the last year that the company broke down U.S. vs. non-U.S. employee counts — 69 percent of the company’s workforce was abroad. The company cut as many as 14,000 U.S. jobs in 2016.
**After Trump’s election, IBM announced its intent to hire 25,000 U.S. workers over the next four years. The announcement came just days before Trump met with executives from IBM, Apple and other tech companies in December 2016, which also resulted in the promise of a $1 billion investment in training and development of American workers.**

Not at all. In a inflationary money system the industry designs products that break down as quickly as possible.
Often times electronic products have a built-in "soll bruch stelle", that lets the product break down shortly after warranty time is over.
Mobile phones get designed in a way that you cannot replace the battery, new software updates are getting forced on it that slows down the device, the design also lets the device break when you drop it.
All these things are designed intentionally to break down quickly so you have to buy a new one as soon as they can get away with.
Washing machines used to be built with robust materials and easily last for decades, and if a part would break, you could easily replaced. Modern washing machine break down after 5-10 years max in a way that you have to buy a new one.
Cars in the 70s, 80s, 90s could drive 1 million kilometers, materials were used that could last a lifetime, and in case something still broke down you could easily replace the part yourself. Nowadays if a car has over 200.000km its considered garbage can. They didnt forget how to build cars that can last much longer, but they want you to buy a new car as soon as possible. And if something breaks even earlier, they dont want you to be able to replace, they want you to bring it back to them, so they can replace it and just endlessly charge you money for it.
Companys found out they could easily make more money by short-lived products.
This is to a large part because of the monetary system, that rewards quick spending of the value-decreasing currency, and punishes saving and accumulating money.
In a deflationary system, hodling money, and make wise, well thought out long term product investment is rewarded, throwing money left and right for products that do not last is discouraged in a deflationary money system.
Companys and the industry would have to go back to producing goods with longevity as a priority in order to compete in this new paradigm shift.
If your in a deflationary money system, you dont want to spend your money on a new phone every year or every second year, because the value of the money would go up during that time, you would prefer a long living product. You would prefer a phone where you can change the battery, change the display, change the frame, etc. if needed. You will want a washing machine that is built by great materials, not ouf of cheap plastic, the market will desire products that last as long as possible.

Nazis were National Socialists ideology. Socialism is a Left wing ideology. Hitler and his National Socialist Party had nothing to do with Right Wing politics. Voting for patriots who represent and working for the benefit of your own people/region is true democracy, freedom, self-determination, independence, and has nothing to do with Naziism.
Equalling Putin/Russia with Naziism is especially funny as there are alot of Jews in Russia, Russia supports Israel, and it was Sovjet Russia, who defeated 90% of the Nazi Army, after they have been attacked and had millions of there people killed, they were the main reason Nazis were defeated. The US entered Europe very late into the War in 1945 to pick up the peaces. Without Sovjet Russia the Nazis would not have been defeated. And after the Russians took all these sacrifizes, millions of dead, they pushed all the way back and had at one point half of Europe occupied. To give Germany and Europe back its freedom, Sovjet Russia freely decided to pull back and leave. History has proven Europe need not to fear Russia, they defeated the Nazis and gave us freedom. Just left when they could have stayed. But the media, the military industrial complex and the gullible always want some kind of instability, sanctions, War against Russia. Its not going to happen. The people have woken up.

I dont think you know the difference between inflationary currencys and deflationary currencys.
An inflationary currency encourages consumers to spent money, and discourages consumers to hold/save money.
A deflationary currency encourages holding/saving money (money will be worth mlre later over time), while discouraging spending.
Why is that so? If the same amount of money is worth more later on, people are reluctant to spend it. If that same amount of money is worth less over time, people are encouragend to spend it.
The market by itself reflects this perfectly. Products are beeing produced the cheapest way possible with the built-in need to be replaced quickly. If people are reluctant to spent money (because of a deflationary currency), products are desired that would have a better longevity. 
This behaviour is supported and encouraged by a deflationary currency. This topic is very logicly and simple, I'm surprised anybody would not understand this simple thing.

It is the companys who pay the tariffs when they import over the border. That raises the price of there product on the shelfes. That gives a chance and supports regional production, it gives regional companies an advantage. It gives incentives to the foreign companies, that produces somewhere were they are allowed to hold slaves and child workers, were their are allowed to destroy the environment, to come to the US and produce locally. 
Every country in the world needs tariffs, to protect there region, there market, there people and there interests. The days of having products produced by slaves and child workers, in places were your allowed to destroy the environment, and then ship the goods 3 times around the whole world are coming to an end.
A new revolution is upon us, and that is about taking care of your own flat, your own house, your own neighborhood, your own country. 
And that is what the Trump revolution, Brexit, Le Pen, Brazil, Austria, Italy, Romania, Poland, Czech Republic, Russia, China, Wilders, Finland, all this new era is about. A new Zeitgeist has arrived. People and nations are raising up to get back there freedom, independence, decentralization, self-determination, representation and true democracy.

Democrats were left alone with alot of votes when it didnt matter anymore, thats why she "cought up" in the popular vote when she really didnt. Trump won the popular vote by several millions.

Yes thats how the scam started you numbnut.
Of all the possible means a government has to control and influence its people, the issueing of money is the most powerful one. Even more powerful than law.
By creating new money, these unelected unaccountable unknown circles inside the privately owned FED can decrease the value of the existing money in circulation, thereby lowering the buying power of those holding it. In turn it can use the created money to buy assets on the free market. 
The US constitution actually spends quite some words on trying to prevent US money from ever becoming fiat. Money should belong to the people was the founding fathers' opinion, and not to unelected unaccountable unknown circles inside the privately owned FED. Thomas Jefferson said:
"I believe that banking institutions are more dangerous to our liberty than standing armies".
William Pitt made this statement: "Let the American people go into their debt-funding schemes and banking systems, and from that hour their boasted independence will be a mere phantom." He realized the maxim that Mayer Amscher Rothschild laid down as fundamental: "Let us control the money of nations and we care not who makes laws."

What you see on Bitcoin exchanges are just numbers floating around. It goes completely against the original idea of Bitcoin and is no different at all to the traditional Banking System doing fractional reserving. A traditional Bank only holds a tiny amount of the money it claims it has stored, aslong as not everyone wants to withdraw his money at the same time they are trading with imaginary numbers on a screen. Same thing happens in Bitcoin exchanges.
It is estimated today that only 1 in 200 Gold assett actually really exist, the rest is just numbers on a display, paper Gold, certificates of Gold that claim the owner has his Gold layong around in a Bank somewhere. Not your keys, not your Gold.
With Bitcoin its the exact same problem, aslong as not everyone withdraws his Bitcoin at the same time from the exchanges, they do the exact same thing as Banks and massively suppress the price by only holding a small fraction of the Bitcoin they claim to have. Gold price has also been massively supressed the last decades through the fractional reserve method.
Now if the talk is about "physical Bitcoin", its about actual real existing Bitcoin, just like "physical Gold", only the physical Bitcoin, the physical Gold is real, everythijg else is just numbers on a display.

Very well said and I agree with much if it. The Dollar as the world currency gives the US an unfair advantage in the worlds economic competition.
International corporations dont care about trade imbalances, they want to produce where human labor are like slaves, where they are allowed to destroy the environment, and then ship goods three times around the world if necessary.
The role of politicians is to represent and to defend the interest of there people and there region. They are supposed to be the opposite power of the International corporations power. And in that role they must try to ensure among other things that weatlh is not just moving out of the country, but that there is equal amount of wealth coming back in.
For many years talking about trade balance and import taxes was a taboo. Nobody even dared mention it. First it was Trump who brought back the topic of trade balance and import taxes. Thanks to his success, now almost every country considers and talks openly about balancing there trade, regional production and import taxes.

BTC is good but the hardest form of money it cant be called after just 10 years where regular  90% drop of value is considered normal. The hardest form of money is gold, silver, etc. money that has been around for thousands of years and cant be changed.

You have to understand Bitcoiners are like from a hardcore religion. Thats why people in the real world only roll there eyey when they meet a Bitcoiner. Bitcoiners are like Yehovas Witnesses. The worst thing about Bitcoin is probably the people in it, I have never seen a community like that. Self-absorbed douchebags, naive, ignorant, know it alls, every shitcoin with a good youtube video has great prospect. But they hate on Gold and everything else that is not Bitcoin. Nevermind Gold has held value for over 40.000 years, and nevermind it holds many of thr same properties as Bitcoin. Its likemthe physical version of Bitcoin without having to deal with hacks, forks, updates, keys and all the other crap. So is Silver, real estate, and many other investments and stores of value.
But its this hardicre religious Bitcoin community that people in the real world try to avoid to have any conversation with, because they are hardcore religious, they believe there is only one good thing in the world, and that is Bitcoin. Gold, Silver, stocks, real estate all crap, only Bitcoin, the only good thing that exists in the world dont you know. Allah uh Bitcoin.

I'm an Arab myself. Contrary to the romantic and noble western propaganda idea of what the Arab spring was all about and why it received financial support and military support, that movement was by enlarge organized, pushed and had mainstream support of Islamists groups, the biggest of them beeing the Muslim Brotherhood who had little interest of any democracy or liberty.
That this was a movement of any "democracy and freedom" was the label and sticker the Western politicians and there fake news media put on this Islamists uprising so they could justify War, armamend, meddling, chaos.
From Egypt to Palestine, to Lybia, to Syria, anywhere a true election is held, Islamists group win by a landslide as the large masses are not interested in democracy, but want the Koran to be the rule of law. Only secularist authoritarians like Assad, Ghaddafi, Saddam, are able to keep freedom of religion, the seperation of religion from politics, and other liberties for the population. Try an election in Egypt and radical Islamists win by a landslide, elections in Palestine and radical Islamists win, Libya the same. People need a strong authoritarian secular populist leader, not democracy, a vehicle that always ends in religious extremism there.

SEPA in Europe is from the middle ages. Transfering money from one bank account to another, even if its within the same Bank Institution, I did that just last month, transfering from one account to another within the same Bank takes up to 1 to 3 workdays. 
If you start a transferation on Wednesday, chances are the money will not arrive until 5 days later (after the weekend). Its no different then before the age of emails, sending a letter through the post office.
If you make a SEPA transfer from one EU country to another, the whole process takes even longer, its a complete joke system.

So when China and Europe run high tariffs against the USA for decades thats perfectly fine to you, something you have probably never ever complained about, but if the US raises tariffs against them back that is unacceptable. Companies want to produce in countrys where they pay child workers, slave salaries and are allowed to destroy the environment, and then just ship it all over. No more. Companies have to come back and produce locally if they want access to the market. The era of economic surrender is finally over. Trump has brought back jobs, raised wages, lowering taxes, and the USA is running better then ever before. After the Obama years of War, economic stagnation, no jobs and low wages. Leftists are blinded by CNN propaganda and cannot admit the Trump presidency has been a incredible success on all accounts. His poll numbers are through the roof, and so are all other indicators of success. But keep living in your CNN bubble.

If Hitler would have been right wing he would have been in a right wing party, he would have supported right wing ideology, small government, small system, personal liberty, corporatism, capitalism, individuality.
Instead he made the socialist party really big (NSDAP, was the "nationalist socialist workers party"), with all its leftist ideology tendencys: big government, big system, big institutions, the state has to look after the collective, no individual freedom, big state systems in place that looks at everybody.
The reason Hitlers ideology got so big was directly through his Socialist political party called NSDAP. Socialism is leftist ideology and has nothing to do with right wing politics. Trying to frame Hitler and his National-Socialists as right wing is known pure political propaganda by other socialists because they dont want to admit what there ideology led to.

Good write up but would have liked to read more about the extreme threat of volatility regarding Cryptocurrency.
You might have 2-3% inflation rate in traditional currency, but in case hyperinflation occurs, you think the masses, the elite,,the banks, the corporations will encourage to switch over and invest into Cryptocurrencies, where 80-90% value crashes are a reoccuring theme every 3 to 4 years.
The fraudulent scammy wealth stealing people enslaving war supporting fiat currency system the world runs on is terrible, but replacing all that with a technology that is so extremely volatile, and where there is hard competition, think about forks, think about new coins taking over market cap, etc. the instability of the nature of Crypto is a gigantic problem.
I believe in Crypto and Bitcoin as much as the next guy. But I see its place rather as an addition to the currency world, a money of the internet, a way to transfer wealth across the world quickly and efficiently.
But as a way to do daily shopping, commerce, to collect taxes, to do other things Crypto has the crazy volatility and instabiity, to take over everything else, I cant imagine that happening or beeing desireable.

What happened to Gold is the same thing happen to Bitcoin. 
Everything was fine with price when people held there own Gold and Institutions sold real actual Gold.
Everything is fine with Bitcoin price if people hold there own keys and Institutions hold real Bitcoin keys.
The manipulation and price suppression start because Banks and Institutions dont sell actual real Gold anymore, they sell paper Gold. It is estimated that only 1:200 Gold value actually exist out there, the rest is just paper fantasy Gold not backed up by anything.
The same is happening with Bitcoin, users have there holdings in exchanges which only hold a fraction of the Bitcoin they claim to have, if the masses dont pull out there Bitcoin all at the same time this scam continues and gets worse. Institutions like Ameritrade and Futures entering the space in the same way they destroyed Gold price, by selling paper Bitcoin, not backed up by actual keys.

Disagree with the graph. For example computer games, in the 90s people thought that 30 years later we would have photo realistic graphics for a long time by now.
The Oculus DK1 VR headset came out in 2013. Who thought that 6 years later VR would just be a little bit better.
Or smartphones, the iPhone came out in 2007. Who thought that 20 years later smartphones would basicly just have better resolution, be bigger, and just have a better camera.
If you go by the articles, predictions and expectations from the 80s and 90s, they thought we would have flying cars by now. Robots and machines having taking over human labor.
In technology things always move much slower then everybody thinks.

The production of an electric car and its huge poisenous unrecyclable battery is an environmental disaster. The electric car has a catastrophical ecological footprint. Its just hyped by giant battery lobbys on politicians and media to fund and subsidies there inefficient environmental electric cars disaster. 
Electric cars and there batteries are much worse for the environment then a V10.

Hitler was a Socialist, the only way he came into power was to get the support of the NSDAP which was the Socialist party.
He supported big Government and big national Institutions, both things perfectly in line with Socialist ideology. Under this system, the State would care for you from cradle to the grave, (Hitler Jugend, life pathway for woman) etc. A big system, big State, big Government is the opposite of right wing politics, its pure Socialism.
Theres no other way Hitlers ideas and system he put into place would have found any traction other then within the socialist party.

As a doctor he stays very healthy and works out every single day (bycicling).
Ron Paul among many other things has started a revolution of understanding and educating the masses through his books and his works in politics and media about what a scam the fiat currencys are, the scam of the federal reserve bank, about the inflation "tax" how he calls it. And about the need for currencys to be deflationary, to have competing currencys, out of the hands of corporations like the fed and out of hands of politicians.
Ron Paul was advocating for something like Bitcoin decades ago. Millions of people would not know what is wrong with the financial system (aswell as the military industrial complex, perpetual Wars, War on drugs) etc. if it wasnt for him. His legacy will live on.

Altright are just people who are against the established republican and democrat party, they see them both as the same "swamp" that needs to be drained.
Altright are against all these pointless Wars both these parties started and never wants to end. 
Altright are most of all Trump supports who just love there country, patriots who wants to see there country doing well.
Brazil, Italy, Austria, Czech, Poland, Hungary, Le Pen, Brexit, Wilders,... its a worldwide movement, where people recognise the importance of voting people into charge that truly care and love there nation.
The false song of Globalism, that enslaved the people, that destroyed the planet, that produced perpetual Wars, is finally over. The Zeitgeist is, the new era is everybody recognising you need to care about your own neighborhood. Its about sovereignty, self-determination, representation, support true diversity, independence, its about true democracy and true freedom.

First reason is, it's not authorized in the Constitution, it's an illegal institution. The second reason, it's an immoral institution, because we have delivered to a secretive body the privilege of creating money out of thin air; if you or I did it, we'd be called counterfeiters, so why have we legalized counterfeiting? But the economic reasons are overwhelming: the Federal Reserve is the creature that destroys value.
From the Great Depression, to the stagflation of the seventies, to the current economic crisis caused by the housing bubble, every economic downturn suffered by this country over the past century can be traced to Federal Reserve policy. The Fed has followed a consistent policy of flooding the economy with easy money, leading to a misallocation of resources and an artificial 'boom' followed by a recession or depression when the Fed-created bubble bursts.
What's happening is there's transfer of wealth from the poor and the middle class to the wealthy. This comes about because of the monetary system that we have. When you inflate a currency or destroy a currency, the middle class gets wiped out, so the people who get to use the money first, which is created by the Federal Reserve System, benefit, so the money gravitates to the banks and to Wall Street. That's why you have more billionaires than ever before.
Nothing good can come from the Federal Reserve. It is the biggest taxer of them all. Diluting the value of the dollar by increasing its supply is a vicious, sinister tax on the poor and middle class.
