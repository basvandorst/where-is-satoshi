For the last picture they need the bitcoin guy to have a space suit on.

As a tesla holder bitcoin has been incredibly stable here recently.

Oh sorry I thought you were a second comment from someone else who mentioned taxes on luxury items. I already posted why that 10% will affect the US poorly in my different comments on this thread.  I would read them over.

This would cause companies to raise prices making things cost much more.  If it costs more to buy from US companies then the demand will go to a different company where what they are buying will be cheaper.   This will make the GDP go down massivly.  10% is a huge margin.  Taxing the GDP 10% would be chaotic to companies and would likely put many of them out of buisness again lowering the GDP.  The average profit margin of the s&amp;p is about 10.7%  you would basically be taking all of their profit.  If you make it harder to make a profit after starting a company then less buisnesses would arise and be competitive.  This would make products cost more because of less innovation and competition.

Banks have been given trillions to avoid a financial mess with banks going bankrupt.  I am not defending the banks here.  The faxt that they messed up so bad in the past is not forgivable but having them go bankrupt would have affected everyone that use them for loans.  The universal income would cause the financial problems that I stated in my last comment, not fix them.

"Socialism is the best system" RIP Agentina.   This is why bitcoin is so important.  When a government fails so does its currency.

I am not against UBI.  I am against to much UBI.  The US simple can not sustain 1k per month per person.  Now something much much less would be more realiatic right now.  As autonomy with factories and buisnesses impacta the work force more then UBI is inevitable but the 1k per month is just very very high for what the US can provide right now.  I think politicians have put out a high number because they want people to think that they don't have to work anymore because they want more voters.  We don't live in a utopia yet.  Someday we will but we are not there yet.

He also wants to give every american free 12k per year.   This would cost a little under 4 trillion dollars per year.  The current US revinue is also a bit under 4 trillion per year.  The US can not afford to pay for this no matter how many large companies you heavily tax.   Even if you taxed those companies it would cause all american  products to cost more money effectivly making the US not have as much income from trade with other countries while also making the cost of life in the US cost much more.   Don't vote for a candidate because of just one of his policies.  Do research and learn what else he wants to do first.

The share prices were not mentioned.  The number I mentioned was the avereage profit margin of the companies within the s&amp;p index, not the index price.

I would love to see his math to allow the 1k by taxing mostly luxuries.  The number shouldn't be based on how much people need for a cushion, it should be based on how much we can afford.

Revinue is just a way of saying income without expenses.  If i had said income someone might have thought it was with expenses included.  The government has revinue from taxes.

+1, pretty sure the title is making fun of that though.
