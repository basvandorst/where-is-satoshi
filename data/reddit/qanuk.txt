Merry Christmas, happy new year too, this community got me back into Bitcoin after I left during the $1200 bubble two years ago, now I'm not so clueless about it so shoutout to you guys!

Why not...

I like lite coin the same amount as Bitcoin so I was still gonna do it, just curious about his opposition. I'm gonna put around $200 cad in Bitcoin and maybe $30 in lite coin, I have a good feeling about Bitcoin and also wanna try buying stuff since it's slowly becoming popular in my city

What do you mean a premium price? 
@_date: 2015-12-25 09:01:56
Already there bud!

ELI5 Local bitcoins?

Haven't tried anything yet was just looking for your opinions, I'll probs do coin base since I have an account there already and just buy at an atm using the cash I got saved, $150 cad isn't that much to lose in cash is it?
@_date: 2015-12-25 10:13:57
I was planning a 7:1 ratio or something around there, 200 or so in btc 30 or 40 in ltc

Why do you think I shouldn't buy lite coin?
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:15:35
Pump? Sorry still a noob haha
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:40:51
Oh, I'm still my sure if I'm gonna sell or wait cause I'm not sure where I'd sell being under 18 I think I'd have to go to an atm

Atombit, there's an app on iOS 
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:15:47
Wow what?
@_date: 2016-01-25 01:37:14
Ohhhhh that makes sense, thanks a bunch!!!!
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:45:20
True, I'm gonna put more in but I don't make much so I can't buy much, would you say I should save and buy a bunch at one time or buy $10 or $5 increments every week or so?
@_date: 2016-01-24 18:14:23
I only have an unverified PayPal so I used Atombit
@_date: 2016-01-24 10:57:35
That makes sense, I guess I won't have to worry about the change, I'm gonna go buy some more soon, what would you say is a good increment to buy in? I went with 2 $5 in the beginning and I can buy $10 more right now but I'm not sure if it's enough to buy.
@_date: 2016-01-25 00:04:20
That makes sense, could you ELI5 the cost average though that's a little confusing?
@_date: 2016-01-24 23:20:14
How much would you say is a few dollars worth? I'm gonna buy more soon I get maybe $5 a week to play around with so would you suggest saving for after the pump or just buying incrementally
