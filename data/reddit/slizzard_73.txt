Thank you!

You’re making a lot of assumptions about his motive for buying the watch. Sure it’s possible he could be just using it to brag but he could also actually have a genuine interest in watches.   By the way I don’t know if anyone’s told you but you sound like a real cunt you might want to fix that

Do you know what fees there are to move money back to your bank account once you've sold crypto on GDAX?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:48:54
Why would anyone want it destroyed?  
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:33:22
If you don’t notice see your crypto missing after 90 days you kind of deserve to lose it right?

Expensive watches often mean more to the buyer than what the public views them for.  People don’t usually buy watches as investments so you shouldn’t judge it as one, because it isn’t one.  
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:03:55
You'd rather them waste it on shit that they won't own in a year, or alcohol, or weed, or fast food?  Explain?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:48:30
I didn’t know this part 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:51:18
That watch probably holds it’s value better than a lot of things that teenagers by
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:17:58
Does anyone know what the address is for?
@_date: 2017-12-01 12:48:07
A Rolex is high up on the list.

I'm pretty sure selling on GDAX has no fees whatsoever.  It's buying that has the fee.  Although the buying fee is much smaller on GDAX than on coinbase.  The issue is it takes serveral days to get your money from your bank to your GDAX account so that you can actually buy bitcoin.

Yeah, “research” , if I’m being honest I have no clue what to do, and I doubt many others do either.  I’m just here for the memes.

Watches can mean quite a lot to people who are into them.  If I’d always wanted one and finally had he financial support to buy one I would.  They’re remarkable little machines.
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:26:41
With practice comes skills
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:46:34
Just because you don’t care about watches doesn’t make them a stupid purchase.  Tons of people get immense joy out of the mechanical marvels they are.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:39:40
Quadrigacx is one I'm aware of. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:55:57
A classic.  What I would give to own one.  Not my most sought after watch but I can appreciate the work that goes into the submariner.  And the history behind the design.
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:00:14
You don't seem to understand it either.  Keep spouting your opinions as fact.  Have fun.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:53:29
A TON of people wear watches and Rolex while scoffed at by people who aren’t into watches is actually a very valuable and respected brand among watch collectors.  
@_date: 2017-11-28 03:36:19
Why would anyone keep their coins there?  Why not put them in a hard wallet?
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:07:22
I would buy somany bitcoins if it was $40 each.  And in time I’d be rich
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:50:17
You’re the dumb one if you think Rolex’s are worthless.  There’s a reason it’s the most valuable brand in watches.

@_date: 2017-11-29 15:05:36
That’s over a year in the S&amp;P 500.  Incredible
@_date: 2017-11-28 06:04:06
I hope it drops, means I’m closer to owning a whole coin!
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:03:49
Your limited definition of investment is artificial.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:48:53
Worst case you lose $100.  Best case you gain money.  Not too risky imo.  I've wasted far more money on far less.
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:03:03
Lol if only you knew how lucky you were!  Triple digits is bananas these days
@_date: 2017-11-29 22:27:06
Lol you should be blaming yourself for relying on the most popular exchange
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:15:35
No shit lol.
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:40:36
21!  This is interesting.  I'm pissed I almost did it in July, but I got in at 8200.  So that was nice.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:55:10
None of that detracts from investing in it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:57:21
Rolexes are anything but junk.  Don’t go around spouting shit you know nothing about.
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:49:22
People said this at 1000.  Don't be like them.
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:14:01
The answer is to hodl right?
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:49:36
Are you an expert in watches?  Because unless you are I don’t see any justification for you to be questioning his purchase.  They hold their value really well and are very impressive watches.
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:48:19
There’s nothing dumb about buying a Rolex.  Hey hold their value very well and are marvels of engineering.  Who are you to say investing a valuable Swiss time piece is dumb?
