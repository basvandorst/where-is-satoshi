I would rather pay someone a little money to get everything right 100% than asking strangers and hoping its right

If you’re serious and have that much, Why don’t you hire a accountant to get an accurate answer instead of asking reddit  
@_date: 2018-01-22 19:01:22
�� lets see 20k before you talk about 100k

@_date: 2017-12-18 20:21:22
You’re better off investing that money into bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:32:11
What’s the point of investing then?
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:05:40
For $10? Better raise the tip cuz that’s not even worth getting up for
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:33:20
this is hitting 20k before 1-1-2018 so you're good
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:17:01
Exchanges were clogged up and took forever to do anything. Rather HODL cuz i know it’s going right back up. And less taxable events to me is better for me when doing taxes

?!? OP probably uploaded a real ID of someone else. So someone performing an ILLEGAL act even though they know it’s wrong and illegal makes the company at fault?
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:39:24
im hung like a horse, does that make me special?
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:08:21
If i had 300 btc just laying around and i cashed out, you can assure my ass is not going on reddit to brag or post
@_date: 2017-12-17 15:39:04
go ask the nigerian prince that has 1 gazillion dollars hidden in his basement
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:49:22
Explain to me and the rest of the redditors how it’s not illegal
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:31:55
come out and tell us how you were joking

@_date: 2017-12-19 23:18:22
Go ask google what you should do with it
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:46:02
Why is everyone freaking out? The internet will be just like it was pre 2015....
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:14:53
Go do something productive with your life instead of fucking coming on reddit for some bs you make up. At least make it somewhat believable 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:22:46
You did something illegal and asking us to help you? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:48:01
You forgot to add :24 second
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:05:55
GDAX and coinbase is the same company but GDAX charges less fees. Go to GDAX website and the login info is the same as coinbase. Just transfer coins from coinbase to GDAX for free than to your wallet

@_date: 2017-12-11 20:23:25
Didn’t it hit 19k?
@_date: 2017-12-20 19:07:44
dumber than a box of rocks to release info’s like that on the net, especially reddit. Here comes the “my acct was hacked” or some bs coming soon
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:49:10
Did it affect bitcoin pre 2015?
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:26:15
He is not like a regular 80yr old grandparents. He just doesnt see the risk or investing in it
@_date: 2017-12-01 03:10:33
would you give me access to your bank account?
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:52:17
Trolled himself
@_date: 2017-12-28 01:42:39
so did you get the coin from the generous guy ?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:45:18
feels like they're throwing money at us right now
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:21:04
Cool story bro
@_date: 2017-12-19 04:39:34

@_date: 2017-12-12 18:28:11
Looks like you fucked up and bought bcash
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:23:02
Yes i get the same fee using credit/ debit but if you transfer to your acct, you dont get charged a fee from your bank, or atleast i dont
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:19:24
Looks like they need more info from you, social security  to withdrawl 
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:37:19
You have your bank acct linked to your coinbase correct? Instead of selecting your credit/debit acct to purchase coins, select the bank acct. it’s going to take longer but you dont get charged a fee by the bank (atleast for me) and your price is locked in when you purchase the coins. You can also use GDAX, which is owned by gdax (same login info as coinbase) for lower fees
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:40:19
Go look up china ban on bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:42:16
Go sell what you have and go buy bcash cuz noone here cares 
@_date: 2017-12-12 19:35:29
Maybe investing is not for you if you need people to make decisions for you
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:38:56
Do you think majority of people that have invested in bitcoin or other stocks would still invest if the value didn’t change?
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:32:02

@_date: 2017-12-19 00:24:05
Only 10k? Take out 100k. YOLO go big or go home rookie
@_date: 2017-12-07 03:20:43
you shouldn't have to make a "new" account with gdax as your login info should be the same as coinbase. Try logging in to gdax using your coinbase login info
@_date: 2017-12-11 16:23:48
If this is real, bcash going to take off
@_date: 2017-12-11 20:49:18
Credit /debit card transaction but fees are higher. The price you bought the coin at should be locked in
@_date: 2017-12-19 23:45:28
Looks like you already made up your mind about btc. No need for strangers to convince you to keep HOLDing
@_date: 2017-12-13 16:55:55
Usaa is the best BUT it is a military bank so not everyone can join

All sales are final once you hit “confirmed”. You will most likely get banned and they will get your $$

I’m a HOLDer and Filthy rich? Haha majority of HOLDers don’t even have one full coin and even if it hit 100k, I wouldn’t call that “filthy rich”
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:16:25
Hope it goes below 1k so i can join the club finally
@_date: 2018-04-20 16:25:17
