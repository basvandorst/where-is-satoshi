Doesn't this encourage centralized channels though? Let's say I have a channel with Amazon, and so does everyone who uses Amazon prime. Then if I want to pay anyone else who also has a channel with Amazon, wouldn't all of our funds be routed through Amazon's channel, assuming that's the shortest/cheapest route? Is this "centralization" potentially dangerous? Is there a way for Amazon to abuse this?

Again, how would they even know? Like I said it happens organically already in extreme cases through the rating system, but you really think uber is going to require you to declare your political affiliations when signing up and then block you if they don’t like it? C’mon
@_date: 2019-07-26 13:57:17
Why and how would uber know or care anything about their user’s political beliefs. Obviously this is happening on Facebook, a social app where people share their political beliefs publicly all the time. Uber is not a social app. They may filter out potential drivers with radical beliefs (probably already happening organically via the rating system) but I doubt they would ever not pick up a customer because of political beliefs, because how would they even know.

This is a stupid post. Coinbase announced they would support bch by Jan 1st 2018 shortly after the fork occurred in August. It's not like they just suddenly decided to support it because of all the newbies getting into bitcoin. We knew this was coming for months. Take off your tinfoil hat.

What are the tax implications of dumping bcash?
Since I never explicitly bought it (it was given to me during the fork) does selling it mean that I pay capital gains tax on 100% of the value I sold it for?

Btc futures are traded on CME which is a regulated exchange. Not sure about them trading on gdax or something.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:07:18
No, you just link your bank account to coinbase. When you buy directly through coinbase you pay a higher fee but get bitcoin for the current price. It takes 7 days to receive the bitcoin (because the usd is transferring from your bank) but you still get it for the price when you bought it, not the price when the funds are received.

This is possibly the pump before the dump when futures trading begins in a week or two? I've been wanting to buy more but also wanted to wait to see how the futures market affected the price.

Your "shitty website" is probably all static assets (html, css, images, etc.) which can be cached heavily and stored on a content delivery network (CDN). This means that people who land on your site are likely actually hitting a different server owned by some company like amazon who invests heavily into ensuring their dedicated infrastructure is top-notch and doesn't break under the load of millions of requests per second. Because the content doesn't change often, it's easy for the ISP to guarantee uptime for heavily cached static sites with low traffic.
Things get much much much more difficult when you have to deal with multiple databases, analytics services, and middleware all talking to each other at the same time while receiving thousands of requests per second. When your site's content is no longer static, you need to store the data in a database. If you're getting thousands of requests per second hitting that database you have to then manage all these read and write requests on your data.
Imagine 1000 people trying to read from different pages of a single book while 1000 other people are rewriting words in that book at the same time. Pretty fucking hard, right?

Watched it the other night. Was a decent overview of the history of bitcoin and the people who really got it going early on, and I definitely learned some new stuff. However I don't think they really did the greatest job of explaining bitcoin itself and how the tech works in a way that your average netflix watcher would really understand. Seemed clear to me that the people who made the visuals and diagrams shown while explaining the blockchain didn't really understand the blockchain well enough themselves to accurately depict it.

In the US it's taxed as capital gains. If you buy then sell in a short period of time, your gains will be taxed as short term capital gains, which is a pretty high rate. If you hold it for over a year, the rate you're taxed at is much lower.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:35:30
That's true. I'm not sure I've seen anyone offering shorting of BCH yet though.
@_date: 2017-08-01 15:28:16
While I'm sure some exchanges will eventually offer BCH shorting, if you wanted to do it immediately you could have simply bought more BTC before the fork. This would result in you having more BCH to sell after the fork. Too late for that, though.

That's not how oauth works. Changing your bank pw won't do anything if coinbase still has a valid auth token saved. They don't store (or ever have access to) your bank password anyways. There should be a way to invalidate the auth token from inside your bank's website though if you want to disconnect the two.
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:56:56
But LIFO results in smaller "gains" to pay taxes on in the short-term, since the difference between the price you paid and the current price is likely smaller.
For example, let's say I own 2 BTC. I bought 1 BTC for $1000 and 1 BTC for $9000 for an average price of $5000. Let's say I owe short term cap gains tax (40%) on the $9000 coin and long term (20%) on the $1000 coin.
If I want to cash out 50% of my holdings when the price hits $10k per coin, selling LIFO means I pay 40% of $1000 of gains, or $400 in taxes. Selling FIFO means I pay 20% of $9000 of gains, or $1800 in taxes.
In the first case, I end up with $9600 and the second case I end up with $8200 in the short term. So selling LIFO would be better if you need the extra cash now, whereas selling FIFO would be better if you don't.
That's my understanding of it anyways. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
@_date: 2017-11-26 04:04:21
You don't owe taxes on unrealized gains.

This is the worst argument in the world. The term "upgrade" in this instance is purely subjective. Furthermore, in the tech world any serious developer will know that *you always need backwards compatibility*. This would be like Apple or Microsoft releasing a new version of their OS and then immediately stopping all support for previous versions, because it's an "upgrade". That's a surefire way to piss off the majority of your users and lose a lot of money.
Most people don't immediately jump to the latest version of anything right when it's released. You need time to let it mature, work out the bugs, etc. The fact that 2Xers feel the need to force this half-baked solution down everyone's throats as an "upgrade" only proves how bad it actually is. Otherwise the tech would speak for itself and adoption would follow naturally.

The price should go down as some of the value will be split off into the new B2X coins. I haven't seen futures for B2X yet so it's hard to say what they will be trading at right after the fork.

At $10k every $100 step is only a 1% change in price. I'd change your intervals to 5% ($500).

Larger block size means it's harder for the average user to run a full node and store the full blockchain on their machine, especially as it continues to grow over time. This results in nodes being consolidated on machines owned by users who have dedicated hardware invested in running those nodes (aka miners). In other words, bitcoin becomes less decentralized (which is the whole point of bitcoin), and mining groups gain disproportionate power over the network.
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:52:43
Good explanation except that Richy McRichpants doesn't own the general store (Amazon), he's just renting fake "tellers" (nodes) from them to make it look like there's lots of interest in the new currency. In reality it's just one or a few actors controlling all these fake nodes hosted on Amazon's servers, and they are likely to evaporate all at once, since it's costly to maintain them. Amazon the company has nothing to do with the situation.

While I completely agree with you and I pay my taxes on all income including bitcoin gains, I'd feel a lot better about doing it knowing that it will be put to use serving the American people.

It'd be nice if there was a built-in system enabling the people to direct some portion of their taxes to be used for a specific purpose.

No, that is not a short squeeze, that's just a short. A short squeeze is when there are a lot of open short positions but the market moves in the opposite direction (up) and forces sellers shorting on margin to close their positions automatically. This causes the price to shoot upwards very quickly as more and more short positions are liquidated. In other words, short sellers are "squeezed" out of the market.

10% markup isn’t that bad when you compare it to fees for using foreign atms. Some have markups of 25% for exchanging currency.

I'm not talking about flat fees which pretty much every ATM has, I'm talking about currency exchange rate markups. For example, let's say you're from the US and are in Europe trying to take out Euros at an ATM. If the actual exchange rate is 1 dollar to 0.85 euro, many atms will give you a much worse rate, like 1 dollar to 0.65 euro and the bank that owns the ATM will pocket the difference.
If you're not careful about checking exchange rates when visiting a new country and using the atms, you can get hit with insane markups on the exchange rates.
If you think about bitcoin ATMs as exchanging one currency to another, the higher fees make a bit more sense.

Let's say BTC is worth $2700 and BCH is worth $300. What I'm saying is that it's already priced in that the value of BTC will "drop" by the value of BCH. Thus BTC is actually "worth" $3000 and the $300 drop from BCH already essentially happened. There's no reason the hard fork should further cause the price to drop because it already happened. We'd be at $3000 if the fork was never even proposed.

The US government in general is pretty fucked up right now. Tax laws are the least of our worries at the moment.

As it stands, that's probably not where they're going thanks in part to a certain orange fuck. That said, I'm not willing to break the law by not paying taxes on crypto gains.

The author's main point in that article is a complete fallacy.
Saying that a bet where you can lose 100% or gain 1000% is always a good bet is just wrong. If there's a 99.99999% chance that you will lose and a 0.00001% chance that you win, then it's a bad bet.
The truth is nobody knows the chances of a crash or of making 100x the money you put into BTC. It's all speculation at this point. For me, I'm betting that the price goes up.

Notice that that huge drop is after the "public" has picked it up. Bitcoin is nowhere near being adopted by the mass public yet. Nor has it been adopted by many institutional investors yet. We are still in that first 1/3 of the chart labeled "smart money". Bitcoin has a long way to go.
