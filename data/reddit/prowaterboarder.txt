Where are you getting this number ? Your ass?

That's what I'm saying. The dollar is a currency, the Federal Reserve is a bank

Lol the rate is like 60% of the cash they have available on hand it's called "leverage". Look up what a Debt/Equity ratio is
Why don't you do some research before you start embarrassing yourself saying things like you're enlightening people
But if you're a dipshit I see how 60% and 1000% look the same

Still, currency is not the same thing as a bank

Lol this is truly the crackpot subreddit
Currency != Bank that's a pretty simple idea I think

No, you are. What you said was banks can lend 10x the amount of money they have available which is patently untrue.
What you have shown is the percentage of cash on hand banks are required to hold of their total deposits, not even counting what they are insured for by the FDIC in the case of a serious bank run.

Against deposits, not money they had loaned lol

I don't see how you think currencies are the same thing as banks
@_date: 2018-10-09 03:39:27
Banks aren't even allowed to lend over a certain percentage of their total cash, I don't see how you think they can magically lend 10x what they have in deposits. You should really do some research on how banking works

The federal reserve is not equal to the dollar
