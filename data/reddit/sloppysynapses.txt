I don't understand how it going past $20k would prove that wrong. It seems like you don't understand what a pump and dump is if you tnink the price going higher means it's not a pump and dump.

So why is CME including it in its futures market? 
Do you even know what those are? Do you even know what bitcoin is? ��
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:22:09
Yep, I agree. 
Which is why if you bought anywhere between $10k-$20k you shouldn't be expecting profits for years, especially because you bought at a ridiculous ATH.
Hodlers would do well to have a plan that says "I will sell 50-100%  in exactly 1/2/3/4 years on this date no matter what the price is."
hodling religiously indefinitely isn't an investment strategy, it's a charity contribution

@_date: 2017-12-06 02:46:32
Strong indication to buy now, we just consolidated at an ATH and broke through it. If you're going to buy at any time soon now is a great time imo. wouldn't be surprised if we're at $12.5k in 12 hours
Possibly $13-14k before another correction

it'll probably dip, but the dip might be higher than what it is right now. Put a portion in
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:30:09
is right, these are bots, they are sussing out the price by making 1 cent market orders and seeing how the market responds to the buys/sells
@_date: 2017-12-03 11:15:06
Yeah, I think lump-sum is more for seasoned investors. Newbies should probably be DCA'ing to avoid FOMO (on the way up/down) and weak hands selling off
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:25:52
if you're not ready to experience massive 10-30% dips over the course of 1-7 days, don't buy in. 
If you want to buy in but don't want to freak out...divide your investment amount by 10 or more and buy every day until you've bought in completely. This is called dollar-cost averaging (DCA)
and will minimize the risk of you freaking out and selling during a dip. 
If it goes down, you get a better price than if you'd bought at the beginning. if it goes up, you lose out on some profits but you've minimized the risk of losing if you buy right before a dip
@_date: 2017-12-05 05:47:13

I said there's been a 12% price swing today
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:10:51
It held up significantly better than last time we had this much volume. $10k day was insane
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:25:47
Why would you go with the current price? lol it can change $300 in a matter of 45 minutes so that's useless. Last night it hit $11,880 and this morning it hit $10,600 which is 12%
also 8% is still a lot in one day

Honestly, that's good news to me. When normal people start buying it that's when the top is about to be in.

@_date: 2017-12-07 09:15:34
This 20% increase in one day is crazier than the 100% run-up. I mean this last 20% is like 40% of that 100%
the past 3 days has been 50% of the run-up

If you're going to buy or sell anytime around a wall, buy/sell before the wall is broken because it guarantees you a good price. Breaking walls usually incurs slippage due to high volume right after so get in early on it
if you buy right after a wall is broken you could end up buying $100-200 higher if the order book is thin and the volume piles on really quick- this is why sell/buy walls tend to create momentum like a big ejaculation. people slowly pile on then towards the end when people realize it's going to be broken...BAM they all pile on to get in on it before it breaks
@_date: 2017-12-04 16:43:25
I meant $11,880! Which is €10000
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:53:32
Not really with mine, it continuously dropped from $11,880 to $10,600 over like 2 hours. Which freaks a lot of people out
Saying there's only been a 4.46% price swing since yesterday is misleading and inaccurate
@_date: 2017-12-21 09:07:27
BTC is your best bet but will reap measly returns compared to some of the altcoins that are booming. In my opinion, alt coins are a gamble, but they can reap huge rewards.
My suggestion if you want to get into alts but also ensure that you see decent returns: Invest 50-80% in bitcoin, the rest in alts of your choosing. 
Ethereum is also a pretty good coin that will definitely see consistent returns over time. It tends not to drop as hard/much as other coins, either. Relatively stable
LTC is another good one but they just saw a *huge* pump so they may not see any decent returns for a while
@_date: 2017-12-31 00:06:07
I'm not saying it'll go down for sure, I'm just saying buying all the way down to $2k is either really stupid or very long term smart

just because the trend could reverse doesn't mean it's 50/50
people have been saying it's a bubble since $1000...why listen to them? you either get rekt and lose 20-50% of your money (I assume most wouldn't hold thru significant trend reversals) or you make much more than that
@_date: 2017-12-20 21:19:39
No problem :)
Personally I'd hold onto it for a bit, I think BCH will cap out at $4k+ by the end of today but no matter what you will still get a decent price as long as you don't hold onto it through a huge dump
@_date: 2017-12-17 22:29:32

um the tax savings on selling at $14k vs $20k on Jan vs a week ago is nowhere near the same thing. if they wanted to cash out they would have. there's plenty of reasons to sell, this theory is moronic 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:01:27
Seeing as we consolidated around $10900-11800 for a few days I'd say $10950 will probably act as lower support, if not ~$11500 before that. 
Very bad news could put us back at $9k or possibly as low as $7.8k but that's not going to be a flash crash, it'd be several days-weeks of a correction.
If you buy right now you'll probably make a decent 5-10% profit before it corrects again. 
Seriously, don't hesitate if you're wanting to buy. It's very likely going to trend upwards for at least a day or two. 
Breaking $12k means we're not on the verge of a correction anymore. Buyers want more
Don't blame me if you lose everything but I'm even considering putting in a lil bit more rn because there's a strong upwards indication at the moment

@_date: 2017-12-30 21:38:57
because if the price never goes up again then you're hodling forever. and in that case you lose 100% 
if you never cash out high and never use that bitcoin you've effectively lost 100% of it 
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:09:36
Agreed but if you're new and see the price drop 30% in 2 days you're going to freak out and want to sell. that's why DCA can be good. some people can't hodl until they're way way up 
@_date: 2017-12-16 06:18:54

If you invested in 1 bitcoin an hour ago, you'd be up $300 right now.
Bitcoin is kind of blowing up right now. The longer you wait, the more you miss out on parabolic profits. Thing is, those parabolic profits will most likely end at some point. No one really knows when. As of right now, it's probably good until at least $14-15k

@_date: 2017-12-06 01:05:23
if we pass $11.9k right now it'll probably be a great time to buy. To be sure, wait for $12050 or $12.1k 
futures won't affect the price for another few weeks unless some others news development
we've been consolidating at an ATH for a few days now so it's looking like an ascending triangle, which is a good indicator we're about to break out upwards
it's possible we might have a decent correction too, but if you want to be sure, wait until $12050 or so and you'll be happy when it's easily $12.5-$13k by tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:41:04

his responses indicated he had no understanding of it. And most people who criticize it don't.
Trust me, there are enough legitimate criticisms of bitcoin. But when people call it "imaginary money" or a ponzi scheme or say it's too good to be true based on absolutely nothing, I figure they don't understand what bitcoin is
They're usually technologically illiterate and don't understand how software works

You can transfer your funds to GDAX and set a limit sell order for 0% fees. 
Have you ever used GDAX? I can walk you through it if you want to sell immediately. 
It will charge a 0.25% fee for selling immediately but that's a significantly better fee than Coinbase charges (1.5%)
At the current price that's a $68 difference if you sell 1.5 BCH on GDAX vs Coinbase. If you sell with a limit sell for no fees that's $80+ saved. Up to you.

How is it not a calculation of risk? I fully admit some some people aren't calculating risk but I personally set a plan for myself and calculated the exact amount of risk I'd take before cashing out. 
And blockchain technology is going to be the biggest buzzword of 2018. Bitcoin in it's current form is weak as hell but there's a ton of room to improve. Software developers are currently in love with blockchains.

If they're not because they provide value based on the company you're investing in, think of Bitcoin as something similar, except it's more of a service than anything.

Coinbase is run by the same company as GDAX. If you have a CB account, you just need to sign into GDAX with those same credentials. Everything will be set up if you're verified already. You can deposit your BCH onto there from CB once your account is set up.

If you know what you're doing, buying at an ATH is fine. A lot of people knew once it broke $11.9k that it was probably going to test $12k and then blow through it. 
Buying at an ATH after the ATH has been going up for 3 hours isn't the smartest idea, though.

If you actually want to discuss with me why this is a scam I'm interested. I don't want to though if you don't understand what bitcoin is or what futures are, what CME is. 
You saying "they sit at home and make money" like it's a problem. That's literally how investing in a market works. You can also sit at home and hemorrhage money.

How did you call this perfectly? and the release date?
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:28:33
depends on if you think it's going to go up forever. The more you hold onto now and the longer you wait to cash out the more you'll cash out (if it keeps going up)
if you cashed out 1/30 of a bitcoin every one of these last 30 days you'd have significantly less money than if you cashed out 1 bitcoin today
@_date: 2017-12-18 06:39:05

Everyone on is euphoric and unrealistically optimistic. Most traders I've read up on have already cashed out and are waiting to see if there's a reversal, since we could be heading to $8k or $9k and possibly a bearish market afterwards

OP could have put in $20k when it was $1,000 so he'd be moving around 20 coins now. 
assuming OP has the average amount of coins in the list: 14k * 20 * 11000 is $3.08 billion 
also, 20 coins * 14,000 is 280,000 coins. that's 1.33% of all coins to ever exist. Sounds about right to me tbh considering lost coins, dozens of exchanges and the fact that 20 coins per average user being audited is probably on the low side

You guys are foolish. $11k was ridiculous. Anyone who's been watching the charts knows it'd correct back down to at least $10,000. His buy orders at $9,000 were lucky but selling at $11k was what *tons* of reasonable traders. 
That's....literally why it corrected

It's a zero sum game if the market cap goes back to $0, so no, not really. If the price continues to go up people don't necessarily lose, they just don't gain much
and yes, play carefully, but if I took 0 risk I'd have made $0 so far and that's a lot less than the $$$ I've made. Bubbles aren't for 65 year olds looking to retire, it's for smart, early money and kids who want to get in before it pops. I get that

I can explain whatever you want, I think I finally understand everything about the order book now. If you have any questions let me know.
I wrote this up a while back so tell me if it's useful. I can clean it up and format it a bit too; I'm thinking of posting this soon enough because I wish someone had verbally explained to me everything when I started.
**Limit Orders**
 - A limit buy means someone has told the exchange to buy bitcoin for them when the price drops to $X.
 - A limit sell means someone told an exchange to automatically sell their bitcoin when the price reaches $Y.
 - **Limit orders *do not guarantee* that your entire order will be filled.** Even if you set a limit order for 1 cent above or below the current price, it's possible it never gets filled (if the price never hits that number again)
 - Limit orders generally have less/no fees
 - People who make limit orders are called "makers".
 - Limit orders are displayed on the order book. 
- On GDAX, the order book is displayed on the left hand side, you can view it in increments varying from $0.01 to $10.00 (the +/- at the bottom)
- The greens are limit buys and the reds are limit sells. 
- This is visually displayed with the depth chart in the middle of the UI (in between your orders/fills and the price graph). This is where you see buy/sell walls (tall vertical lines indicating a large amount of bitcoin to be sold/bought).
**Market Orders**
 - A market buy means someone has told the exchange to buy $X amount of bitcoin, even if the price moves while fulfilling that order (this is called slippage).
 - A market sell means someone has told the exchange to sell $Y amount of bitcoin, even if the price moves. 
 - **Market orders are *guaranteed* to fill your entire order.** If you want $1000 of bitcoin, you're getting $1000 of bitcoin. 
 - The people who make market orders are called "takers". 
 - Takers on GDAX are charged 0.25% fees on every transaction (this % goes all the way down to 0.1% if you trade a significant volume over time).
 - **The price moves when someone burns through all of the current limit buys/sells, depending on which way the price is going.**
**Stop Orders**
- These are essentially market orders that are triggered after a certain price is met.
- These are generally used by traders to ensure that they don't miss out on big swings in price.
- A buy *stop* set at, say $1000, for 1 BTC, would mean that someone puts in a market buy for 1 BTC as soon as the price hits 1 cent above $1000.
- A stop *sell* is the same thing, but the opposite direction: when the price dips below a certain point, the exchange would sell the specified amount of bitcoin.
- Stop orders are guaranteed to fill the entire order unless they are stop limit orders. This essentially is a market order with a limit on the price. If enough slippage occurs during the market order, the limit kicks in and the whole order isn't filled. This could've been very useful for some people who made market buys at, say, $9000 when the price dipped this past week. If they wanted to only buy at $9000 and not at $8900 (because maybe they believe bitcoin will crash if it dips below $8900) then they'd set a stop limit buy at $9000 with the limit at $8900.
- **Stop orders are not displayed on the order book.**
- Stop orders can cause a big price spike/dip because they'll chew through the order book very quickly right after large, round numbers. 
**An example of how a market buy would push the price up by burning through limit sells:**
 - Say the current price is $100. 
 - There is 1 bitcoin at a limit sell for $100. 
 - The next offer is 1 at $200. 
 - The next offer is 1 at $400. 
 - If you place a market buy for $600, you get:
   1. the first bitcoin at $100
   2. the second at $200
   3. and 0.75 bitcoins at $400 (you pay $300 for it, $300/$400 is 0.75 bitcoins)
 - you now own 2.75 bitcoins and the current bitcoin price is now $400 with 0.25 bitcoins being offered at $400.
The sell walls (or buy walls, just swap sell with buy and up with down here) just means there's a huge amount of BTC to be sold at a certain price. Usually at round numbers, it can get up to hundreds of bitcoins. Since the price doesn't move until all these orders are filled, sell walls essentially stop the price from moving up until every single one has been completely sold. 
Let me know if that helps. I may have abused the bold/italics in there but hopefully it's pretty readable.
Also if anyone finds any errors please let me know.

Don't check the price for 4-6 weeks. Once you're safely up 20-30%, past the next dip, you can start obsessing. :) 
@_date: 2017-12-06 20:10:32
Coinbase instant buy with credit/debit. 4% transaction fee plus their premium (they mark the price up about another 0.25%)
If you buy at $13300 you'll break even at $13865
Since we have already seen a 13% increase today it might go up more. Could crash 20% np one knows. Something fishy is going on because 13% increase is wild
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:40:33
Very possible; however, if you don't buy now you could be looking back in a few weeks wishing you got in at sub-$11k.
This happens every dip it seems. Overall I'm betting it'll hit $15k in a month, but if it corrects to $8-9k I'm fine losing that

I'm a total noob but it looks to me like it does this at almost every ATH. drops about 4-5% and then recovers. already started recovering within hours
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:16:42
In general, you don't really want to buy at an all time high. Wait until it fits 3-5% below or something and you're more likely to see gains. 
There's a psychological aspect to ATHs that is broken down once it's hit 
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:12:33
4% fee. 2.5% plus their base 1.5% fee

7,200 to 10,800 is 10,000 to 15,000 and the former happened in...3 weeks? with the dip like 4 weeks. so who knows
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:06:33
Wire or transfer money to Gdax. Less fees. Takes longer.
If you think Bitcoin is going to increase more than 4% in the next day, use debit/credit on Coinbase (fees are 4%, very high, but you get it immediately).
Wiring takes a day max (can be same day if you do it by 1 PT) but also costs a flat $10 plus whatever your bank charges (probably $10-20). You'd have to deposit more than $750 to beat the 4% fee from debit/credit if you're paying $30 total to wire. 
Transferring funds from bank takes a week but has no fee.
Only people who seem to have issues with Coinbase are in countries that aren't supported and think Coinbase is trying to steal their money when their account gets frozen. Also the people moving $100k around in a day

It's just dumb to blame them for the lengthy process especially when they're a huge part of why bitcoin will be accessible to millions of new people.

Mining is not profitable. Use coinbase to get started buying some coin; if you invest more than $100, deposit money from your bank account into GDAX because coinbase fees are really high.
Don't day trade unless you're on GDAX and even then don't day trade because you're going to suck at it

Just watch your  $30 go up and down. Investing anything short of a few thousand is pretty much worthless at this point since you're not going to see huge changes in the span or days/weeks. 
Pretend you invested $3000 and it'll be more fun 
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:41:10
it depends. Watch to see if the price falls below $8,000 frequently for a few days.

@_date: 2017-11-23 01:54:52
Deposit to Gdax using your automatically created Gdax/Coinbase joint account. Coinbase fees are fine for newbs, just don't buy more than $100 using your credit/debit on there.
Either wire $1000s or deposit from your bank (takes about a week) 
@_date: 2017-11-06 05:07:34
Can't tell if I should buy more now or not. I bought at $5500, 6500, and then 7500, but am wondering if I should get this dip before it goes up. Looks like it's already heading back up. Went below $7100 for a hot minute and it's already back up to 7250
just sad I didn't wait like...3 hours for the dip. but whatever it's like 4%
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:49:43
divide future price by current price and that's the percentage it moves. 
Multiply your current value by that 
if you have $100 invested at price of $200 and it goes to $400 you do:
($400/$200) * $100 = $200 
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:52:30
How would you do a stop buy if you already have a limit sell at 7960? 
If you only had the funds for 10 btc once you put in a limit sell you don't have any money left to do a stop buy.

all of your thinking is flawed. you don't need to invest $20k to get $40k returns...unless you're wanting them in about 3-6 months, assuming bitcoin stays extremely bullish
Your $200 took years to get to $10000. In a few years your $200 again here could possibly be $10000

@_date: 2017-11-26 19:55:32
it literally happens after every all time high. people get worried it's not worth that much. then it slowly consolidates over a few days
did you expect it to stay at $9599 for 3 hours straight before dropping?
it could be market manipulation and it could also just be people profiting off the newbies buying at round number ATHs and then selling when it drops $100 in the next 30 seconds
hell I could've done it if I had the cajones, it's not hard to know that the price is gonna drop $100-200 after hitting an ATH. thing is if you time it wrong, you lose $100s very quickly. 
it went up to $9470 from $9180 in the time I wrote this comment to now (10 minutes). it's just how the market behaves when it hits all time highs

If you have $500 and you want it to grow by 100% to $1000 and you bought it at $7700 bitcoin will have to go to $15,400.
To reach $50,000 you'd need bitcoin to be $770,000, which, if it kept increasing exponentially consistently (unlikely), would still take on the order of years.

Most of us, or at least a lot, use Coinbase and Gdax. Coinbase  to get your feet wet and get a feel for owning &amp;lt; $100 but past that and the fees get exorbitant. 
Deposit with your bank account and use Gdax once you get familiar with Coinbase so you can avoid Coinbase's high  fees. They're the same company so transferring funds and bitcoin is instant and free.
Or if you are afraid of missing a big spike, wire transfer from your bank. It's a flat $10 + whatever your bank charges so it's a low % fee if you deposit thousands.

someone said if you buy with bitcoin just replace what you bought
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:21:21
lol what a lie? Last one I tried cost $8
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:11:10
Talk to your bank if the transactions don't show up in a few days. mine showed up in 3 days
if you keep re verifying it sends new transactions and invalidated the old ones so that could possibly be why (it was for me, I had to verify like 6 times)
transaction fees for coin base are really high so $5 won't make you any money at all but you can watch it go up and down. they also inflate prices a bit when buying, too I think.
buying is at 1.5% for bank accounts and 4% for credit/debit
selling is like 1.5% I think
Gdax is the same company but is an actual exchange so their fees are only at 0.25% per transaction. you can only wire or deposit money thru a bank account though and that takes a few days 
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:56:20
someone probably made em to get more people to buy in

I'm fairly sure that accounts getting frozen is a non-US thing. If you're not overseas I don't think it really happens. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:36:36
But then you can't invest in it either way..? 
Do you have $40,000 to invest or $40,000 to spend
@_date: 2017-11-26 17:25:19
I'd wait personally. then again 20 minutes  ago I would've told you to wait and it was $200 cheaper
if it breaks $9500 then it's probably going to go to at least $9700-9800 before we really start seeing a ceiling
however, it might hover under $9500 for days again 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:29:20
exact opposite, lol
if everyone thinks everyone else will sell, everyone sells
thing is, asia (south koreans on bithumb) push the price a lot and they don't have the same psychological barrier at $10,000 because they're not using USD. 
it'll still be a barrier, but I've found that generally SK/asia seems to push the price more frequently than the west does
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:56:12
it's gonna break $10k in less than an hour ��
e: 6 hours early. not too bad ��

She only goes down on me smh 
@_date: 2017-11-26 03:51:37
a lot of people are coming off the high of the big boost today but the truth is if you wait a bit the price will probably drop to $8500-8700 over the next few days...
unless it  decides to blow past $9000 randomly. It's hard to tell. From what I've seen, every ATH is followed by a 2-3% price dip at some point in the next few days
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:53:53

ltc had a wonderful 10% value parallel to btc when it went from $94 to $100.6 in about 30 minutes
dropped pretty fast after that though
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:13:09
because GDAX is generally what everyone here uses since we're mainly western/from the US. 
Also, pretty sure bithumb is at a premium

Literally every 2 minutes someone posts about buying bitcoin on this sub. Imagine how many people aren't posting about it. I see a lot of 0.07 buys on here so that's about $500. Imagine it's just 20 people every 2 minutes buying their first $500 of coin. That's 900 coins a day from new users
Coinbase doubled its userbase last month from like 1 million to 2 million. There's a ton of &lt;1 bitcoin investors entering the market. Lots of newbies buying at ATHs. It's not crazy
@_date: 2017-11-08 03:12:35
that's not op
@_date: 2017-11-26 16:54:12
Someone said bithumb/SK are leading the charge, but another said bithumb wash trades. What do you think?
I don't know enough to know if bithumb is wash trading...but from every time I've looked, bithumb rises before GDAX and GDAX follows, even accounting for the premium on bithumb
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:14:31

down 20% since i bought tho lmao fuck me in the ass
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:28:50
Use GDAX. you can transfer coins instantaneously from coinbase to Gdax. Gdax has almost no transaction fees. 
The only issue is depositing money. once you have your coin though, put it on Gdax if you're buying/selling
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:34:43
lmao this shit really brings out the crazies 
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:58:32
eh you could be right but it went up 50% in the last month so you could also be very wrong 
@_date: 2017-11-28 05:12:31
5 hours late but i could feel it! tbf being 5 hours late means i wasnt that right lmao
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:44:30
no, the buy/sell orders for 0.01 and 0.03 don't move the price. Those are bots feeling the market
eDIT: unless you're talking about 0.01/0.03 bitcoin. those can sort of move the price, but they're not exactly the big movers
What usually happens is a big whale will sell off 200 coins in one go or a bunch of people find the next ATH too high for comfort so they sell and it scares people into thinking this is as high as it'll ever be for a while. then it sets off a quick sell that drops the price 100s in minutes. 
once it hits a lower level that people believe is more sustainable, it levels off. then it begins to rise slowly again. this is how it consolidates. it's already currently doing it. went from $9600 to $9180 in about 10 minutes. now it's consolidating around $9400, which is where it'll stick for at least a few hours before moving considerably (in my completely unprofessional opinion)
It did this same exact thing at $8400. It dropped to $7980 a few times but generally hovered around $8150-8250
@_date: 2017-11-19 05:24:35
no sorry, they have a $10 flat fee (coinbase) and my bank has a $20 fee.
It was $30 to wire.
It's $30 for me no matter how much I wire (as far as I know)
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:23:26
Simplest way to think about it:
Multiply your starting amount by the factor it increases by:
$6000 to $50,000 is 50000/6000= 8.333 times increase
$200*8.333 = $1666.67
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:58:45
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:58:28
If you're not worried about it going down short term then you're definitely good for a while. I'm fairly positive there won't be any major corrections/dips until $10,000 but i have no idea what i'm talking about. when the big money from CME comes into play we'll have to watch out but chances are it's just going to consolidate and fortify its value above 10k
@_date: 2017-11-17 21:09:06

Just keep using it, Coinbase/gdax are fine
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:13:12
you bought at an ATH at a premium because that's how Coinbase works. 
Also, you're probably pretty happy now that you bought quickly with Coinbase's instant lock-in price than having waited a few days, ya?
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:33:42
Buy literally right now, everyone is elated. the price will go to $10,200 at least before any sort of correction
disclaimer I'm basically high on the elation of bitcoin hitting $10,000 so my advice is a bit biased
in all seriousness I really think there's some serious upwards momentum and $10,000 will be a HUGE psychological support level
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:01:52
go back to r/btc meanie 
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:32:39
this question just leads to people asking "why don't you put all your money in bitcoin?" and then it's like well Im trying bruh
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:28:32
Because it doesn't just constantly hit new ATHs every second of the day. there's **always** small dips. Once you're 2-5% below an ATH you should feel a lot more comfortable buying in
@_date: 2017-11-16 08:23:50
and this month was the only month alt coins were more profitable 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:56:45
Honestly it's better for you in the end lmao

nope bitcoin is literally not software
@_date: 2017-11-12 22:20:47
Whatever you don't mind losing. I doubt it'll crash huge ever again but you should be prepared to lose at least 80% of whatever you invest.
For a college student, just buy 0.015 bitcoins for about $90. Watch it go up and down and do some trading for fun
@_date: 2017-11-20 08:17:42
lol why conspiracy theory? bitcoin is getting extremely popular again and people are wanting to get in on it
@_date: 2017-11-27 23:43:28
Verify yourself on Coinbase. Buy $10 on there with fees. Figure out how to transfer coin and USD between Coinbase/Gdax (it's very simple). 
Once you've done that, deposit $10000 or whatever you want onto GDAX. Takes 5 business days. 
Once Gdax shows you have funds, Click "Limit" on GDAX. Click advanced. Make sure "post only" is checked. Type in 1 in the bitcoin box. Type in the current price of bitcoin - 0.01 in the USD box. 
Hit "Buy" and you've now set a buy limit for one cent below the current bitcoin price, meaning as soon as it drops 1 cent you'll buy 1 bitcoin with 0% fees. If the price never hits the price you set, you never actually will buy bitcoin. 
Do a market buy for 0.25% fee if you want to ensure you get the bitcoin immediately. The amount you get depends on the market price when your order is filled, so if you make an order while the price is rapidly fluctuating you could get a worse/better deal than the price you clicked Buy at. Thus is called slippage. It won't result in a huge difference, but it adds up over time and could be significantly different if slippage/spread are large. 
Wire money before 1 PT to get your funds onto GDAX in less than 12 hours. Costs a flat $10 plus whatever your bank charges. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:11:56
Gotcha. Keep forgetting after 3k it went down to 2k....so going down to 3600 in this case it'd still be normal.
went down from $4950 to $3200 too 
Doesn't this mean I should sell and then buy later to get more? If I originally bought high, that is. I guess no one really knows when it'll stop dropping? dunno
@_date: 2017-11-29 08:41:06
Verify on Coinbase, took me 1 hour. Live in US
Wire transfer. &amp;lt; 6 hours if done before 1 PT with $10 flat fee from Coinbase and $20 flat fee from my bank 
@_date: 2017-11-12 07:28:37
should've bought 30 mins ago, went up $600 lmao this shit is cray i cant handle it
@_date: 2017-11-17 17:31:29
Technically you don't own any bitcoin on Coinbase. They just promise they'll give you it if you want to withdraw it.
@_date: 2017-11-17 01:27:24
Fuck this is so simple and makes so much more sense
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:27:46
Uh? just replace your bitcoin as you spend it if you believe it's going to keep going up. I don't see how this is a criticism 
@_date: 2017-11-25 04:55:52
then fiat becomes useless too
if we had no electricity people would only trade material goods
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:29:42
This isn't directly to you but just explaining for anyone reading. 
AFAIK when you short, you borrow bitcoin at a price you believe is going to fall. You sell it, wait for it to fall, buy back the same amount of coin and give it back, pocketing the difference between what you sold it for and what you bought it back at.
If the value rises too high after you sell (meaning you're losing money), the deal defaults to buying the bitcoin so you don't lose more than you intended and the coin is returned to the original owner at the higher price. 
So what happens, I think, is after a certain amount of upward movement, a lot of shorts default to buying and it adds *even more* upper movement because there's now more coin being bought. I imagine it has a domino effect until most/all of the shorts are defaulted. 
Not sure if default is the right word but yea
@_date: 2017-11-26 20:15:34
Totally agreed. If fear motivates you to sell, you probably have too much invested and/or are being greedy.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:25:24
Meh just go to a different sub..? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:40:33
Ive been wrong like 8 times lmao
well actually I've been right I just anticipate it too quickly. 
I think it's going to break $10,000 after two more tries, but I've been wrong several times before lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:12:02
Coinbase is almost as easy as buying something off of Amazon. Enter credit card info, verify two $1.XX transactions deposited in your bank account, there ya go 
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:23:01
Don't sell, it'll go back up. 
Don't ever buy at an ATH again though. It's unnecessarily scary
@_date: 2017-11-03 07:56:24
A lot of people seem to think it's going to keep going up for quite a while 
@_date: 2017-11-19 01:06:44
Buying weekly is called Dollar Cost Averaging and is a much safer way to invest a lump sum. 
You lose out on potential profits but hey, you've already lost out on a shit ton anyway. You also protect yourself from huge drops. 
Invest daily if you're that impatient. 
Also if anyone explains anything like DCA to you they're not assuming you're stupid, sometimes it's for the sake of anyone else reading the subreddit. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 03:37:27
it does that all the time. it's a 1.5% movement. It's struggling to pass $8k but once it does we'll probably see a lot of movement up or down after sitting at $8050-8100 for a hot minute. just my guess
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:51:07
that's a great point.
bitcoin is more like Apple and Microsoft in the dot Com bubble 
@_date: 2017-11-06 03:53:41

@_date: 2017-11-23 09:46:33
@_date: 2017-11-23 00:10:11
Yeah, I actually thought about it a bit and I agree with you. I'm here arguing that Coinbase is great because they're introducing people to crypto but also saying that newbs and technologically illiterate people can go fuck themselves. Doesn't make much sense
I think you're right, they should definitely ramp up the customer support especially if they're taking in the vast majority of new users
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:41:41
I guess, but people act like Coinbase is some shady shitty group. It's more that some people on this sub are trying to invest and literally don't know how to do basic math and navigate a simple website
@_date: 2017-11-13 04:26:06
Did you sell it or wait? 
@_date: 2017-11-25 10:25:40
Why are you falling for bcash FUD? That's already happened like 4 times now haha

not trying to spread FUD just worried
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:17:01
it did a while ago, it's about to break $8100 lmao
@_date: 2017-11-13 16:39:44
Yes, if it's a guaranteed price drop you should sell and buy back unless you're extremely committed to supporting bitcoin to the point where you forego profits. 
Only thing is you can't be sure if it's going to go down
@_date: 2017-11-17 08:20:18
starting to feel like you should just always buy the dips. if it's hit $8000 already there's a psychological aspect that lowers the huge sell wall people will want to put up 
@_date: 2017-11-12 04:39:48
If it's happened liked 4-5 times now I think that means you're actually pretty good at predicting prices, just need to utilize it to wait til it drops haha 
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:26:03
Yeah I was going to buy at $5500. Would've already made an 18% increase ��
@_date: 2017-11-13 21:37:32
Because you're contributing to the avalanche of huge drops? I guess if you plan on reinvesting low then you could say it's helping fortify it 
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:52:44
I don't necessarily believe it and his numbers seem off but:
$200-&gt; $7000 -&gt; $245,000
2013 -&gt; 2017 -&gt; 2021 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:18:48
Just as many/more people think it's worth at least or more than $10,000. 
Tbh I'm one of them, once it passes $10,000 I'm starting to truly believe it's going to soar 5% very quickly
@_date: 2017-11-11 22:53:16
that's more than a million now then...?!

No one knows, anyone who says they do is lying (or trying to rationalize their investments). There are trends and patterns but you really never know for sure unless you're a whale moving billions of dollars and controlling the price. 
Jump in and get used to feeling like shit worrying about your money because the faster you detach your emotions from it the better 
It's one thing to watch the price drop and go back up with 0 money invested. It's another to watch your $7500 go to $5500 and back to $8000 in a week 
You can dollar cost average, which is generally safer: invest a small amount on a consistent basis. Or you can go all in on what looks like a dip. You might lose 20% a day after though.. And you're going to want to sell but 99% chance you shouldn't. 
You also might gain 20% in a day...like I said, no one knows. 
Investing small amounts regularly is probably the safest and least emotionally taxing way of getting started. You might miss out on huge gains. but you might also avoid huge losses

Limit buy means you set a buy to go off once the price dips below a certain point. It means you pay 0% fees on buying your coin. You can only do this on GDAX, not on Coinbase. They're owned by the same company, but GDAX is an exchange and Coinbase is just a place where you can buy/sell bitcoins (for marked up/down prices with high fees).
On large purchases, this is a significant amount of fees avoided (for 1 bitcoin, you save 0.25% from a market order on gdax up to 4% from coinbase credit card buy: that's $20 to $320 right now at $8200/btc)
You will need to transfer funds to gdax first.
Personally I would suggest not using a credit card/debit card on large orders because the fee is so high. You'll only break even once bitcoin rises 4% in price, which will take anywhere from a day to a week to a few weeks depending on how rough the week goes.

oh yeah of course :) I bought at the $7,800 ATH and it immediately went down to $7,200 in 30 minutes and then crashed to $5,700 over 10 days after that. it's a thing and it happens.
But look at my $7,800 dumbass decision now
@_date: 2019-06-12 11:47:35
Why do so many boomers who use btc sound like they're trying to sell you snake oil

whatd you buy at 
@_date: 2017-11-08 18:51:09
How'd you know it bounce back up before $7,000? Are you gonna hold now or sell soon again and wait to buy low again?
@_date: 2017-11-29 10:27:41
but this has been a sustained 18 month rally 
@_date: 2017-11-21 06:15:25
But...that's not why it's ever crashed...right? Has it ever actually crashed for that reason? 
It's always crashed because of some exchange fucking up or some country banning it or something. It's never crashed because suddenly everyone collectively realized it's not being used for what it was originally intended for
@_date: 2017-11-22 22:53:18
I believe you and that sounds about right. Personally I already withdrew to see how long it'd take and it was like 3 days but i went into this knowing it could be weeks before I could withdraw 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:21:25
it's about to fucking do it
@_date: 2017-11-16 20:56:38
except you buy low and sell high. not buy high sell higher buy higher sell higher
anyone who cashed out at $7800 then bought back in at $5500 got a 30% increase in value

it's back up to $10580. 
Stop watching the charts for tonight. It's only $750. 
Japan and korea are trading at $11336 and $11949 respectively.
We have followed their prices for weeks. Day traders are trying to squeeze money out of the little guys.
Don't let them scare you
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:57:01
Short term yes, but there have been several corrections already and it's recovered to ATHs  shortly after. 
also just hit $10,900...given, it is now $10,300 but the fact that it hit $10,900 means it will very likely hit that again since we've already broken that level
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:42:19
not worth it, you're about 5 years too late

@_date: 2017-11-28 23:18:44
The Asian markets, Japan/SK- i.e., bitflyer/bithumb move the markets a lot more than we do sometimes
bithumb is at a premium but it's already $10,600 and bitflyer broke $10,000 a while ago
Gdax is just taking forever to follow. once the arbitrage becomes more profitable than inconvenient, Gdax will break $10,000. 
since Asia is just waking up id bet a lot of money it will happen within the next 12 hours

Hodlers don't affect the price. You bought, price went up. Now? Nothing. You're at the mercy of the whims of the market

Well go check it out.. There's still people thinking this is the bottom. but if you listened to btc markets over this sub you'd have at least known there was a strong chance of this happening a long time ago 
of course there won't be moon talk at $8k. it'll be a lot of capitulation from here on out. People saying "can't believe I fell for the hodl memes..."

You just don't understand it. most TA is bullshit, yes, but there's some very simple stuff that even the best use to get better entries and exits. Past that it's generally not particularly useful, yes, but it's not complete 100% bullshit.
And most TA you've seen is probably retards drawing diagonal lines and patterns on the 5 minute charts.
