Free Geek is an amazing organization. I donate most of my old parts to them (my local one) and have found some great finds in their thrift shop.

His point being that an address having more bitcoins then there are in existence is impossible.

I'll have to try that some time.

Trump? Really? You want to be somebody who has bankrupted himself numerous times and spreads horrible rumours in attempts to destroy careers?

Looks delicious! What did you get? I see Naan and Basmati Rice, but I can't tell what the other things are. Butter Chicken (my favourite), perhaps?

Wow. So much ignorance and hate in one paragraph. Please leave the internet. We don't need people like you here.

Somebody gave 0.0001 BTC. Almost worse than nothing.
@_date: 2014-03-11 04:31:51
It should be. He's scum.

It makes no sense. If anything, the pizza should be the bitcoin since people are selling off and otherwise getting rid of their stashes.

Finally a sensible, non-circlejerk comment. I mean.. DAE HATE THINKGEEK??! GUIZ?? GUIZ???!?!
@_date: 2014-05-27 05:43:05
Some of the stuff on there is from Thinkgeek.

Indeed. I missed my buy-in point.

Probably not, since most use a different algorithm than Bitcoin and ASICs (application-specific integrated circuits) are VERY application specific. 
@_date: 2014-02-09 01:21:39
A bit, yes.

Having that sticker could easily be seen as actively soliciting for tips when the policy is to not accept tips.
Putting up a poster for your business is every bit as much solicitation as going door to door asking for people's business.
