Simply put this is to keep people from hoarding money in one spot. The solution will be to move the money into another, better, bank or actually invest more into your business or other things. No economy can have holders, not even bitcoin.

Bitcoin makes up less than $15k in sales per day for overstock. This is less than a quarter of a percent in sales. I don't see how Bitcoin gets much out of this.

It is funny that this auction requires only a government ID while most bitcoin ATMs I have come by require an ID, phone number, hand scan or thumb print, if not more.

It is their call to make. It is in the terms of use and contracts you sign with them when you join. Once again as I started this comment tree, you are free to leave with your money to a bank that will do the transaction.
@_date: 2014-11-14 14:27:18
It is your money as you can withdraw it. They are a private business that can decide not to be involved in Bitcoin. Your job is now to take this money and move it somewhere else.
@_date: 2014-11-21 23:23:30
So only some companies are keeping the bitcoins given while the majority use a company that hands them cash after that company gets bitcoins. 
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:16:52
But what can I use it on? Also if I buy today and it loses 8% value overnight I might never come back to buy more.

Well unfortunately Bitcoin is going to suffer s similar fate unless something is done. One big obstacle to people accepting it is the fact that a few people own the majority of them. While more physical dollars are being printed it is to allow new people to acquire some themselves, once bitcoin mining will be finished about 200 few people will own over 20% of all coins ever made. [Link]( People are not going to be adopting bitcoin if only a very select few own a fifth of them.

Not exactly. He is trying to move money through a middleman. This middleman does not want to be involved with the receiver so the owner of the money(OP) will have to find a middleman that will transfer his money to the receiver.

If you can not handle a free market economy and want some regulations then go fiat. It is not that hard.

The government is not getting anything until the case is over and they win. If they lose the rightful owner gets to keep his money.


The man did it previously and he is known to be a heavy investor in things he likes. He also wants bitcoin to get attention and really believes they will be worth $10,000 each in a few years. He has done television interviews where he says these things on Bloomberg.

I believe you have not read up much about the ongoing case. The selling of these bitcoins are happening as the owner, who is currently awaiting trial, agreed to it as he wanted the funds held in escrow if he gets them back later.
@_date: 2014-11-02 23:52:38
Not until we can get off the fiat standard will Bitcoin be a true independent currency. As long as people trade between fiat and Bitcoins it is a side-creation of regular fiat.
@_date: 2014-11-14 20:53:19
But that is not what happens. You are giving them a suitcase of money and telling them go give Person A $100. You can also come to visit them and withdrawal $100 and then give Person A the money yourself. The situation the OP was is was "Hey transfer $X over to Person A for me." which the bank said no to.
@_date: 2014-11-03 00:01:48
No, at worst if you cash out those two cents you will have nothing as they will be eaten away as fees. :(

The bank will be intervening again but onyl when their market will be starting to collapse. Right now they are having a "controlled" adjustment. :P

If a bank does not transfer money over it is because the receiver is not trusted to be financially legal. If Target owners are found to be involved in some weird international drug trade not only will you not be able to use your card there but they will be shut down.

How would people be able to buy bitcoins when most people are holding?

With major municipalities under the control of mainly one internet provider, along with the fact the three major providers have been holding firm that 10 Mbps is a fair speed for industries in the US I am highly doubtful that bandwidth is increasing everyday like you say. I personally have had 18Mbps only for the last 2 years in my area and will not have faster speeds for at least another 4-5 years. 
There is a reason Comcast is hated and customer service is one problem. The other is shitty speeds at high costs.

Huh... You are technically correct. The best kind of correct.

People do not donate as much as they say they will. Some places had to start closing the bitcoin donations page as they ended up getting $15 on the first month and then nothing for three months straight.

People who upvoted this do not understand the stock market or how things are valued. Literally. 
Fact: Bitcoin sales make up a fraction of a percent of sales per day. A fraction of a percent.

So by this logic if I take a suitcase of money from one guy and a suitcase of cocaine from another, swap them so each man gets the others case, neither was involved in a drug trade?
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:04:43
This was not a heist of dollars. This was an attempt at identity theft which is far more valuable since stealing money from an account can be reversed. Unlike bitcoin transactions. No CHARGEBACKS!

Not worth buying right now, still falling until another Bearwhale appears.
@_date: 2014-11-27 19:25:21
Were they in a cold wallet? Seems thieves have found an exploit recently or have been using a Tor exit node to get passwords and started moving funds in the last few days.
@_date: 2014-11-30 14:20:59
The bitcoin ones sure are false... Costs about 2%-6% to transfer in total depending on how you do it.
@_date: 2014-11-18 21:46:33
Don't pay. Not worth enabling the morons who are stealing money from working folks.
@_date: 2014-10-31 19:14:50
Will we get another BearWhale like last time? It was fun to watch people buy him out.
@_date: 2014-11-18 18:27:34
We can expect him to go for $1,000 a coin again.

The man is rich and said that he has faith that bitcoin will hit $10,000 in a few years. He is a true believer and puts his money where his mouth is. Also he spent that much last time to make sure he won.

What is happening here?!?! I am very impressed!
@_date: 2014-10-04 14:35:43
Sell everything of bitcoin. Buy back in at a new bottom. It should drop to about $285 before people start pushing more buy orders in. Right now too many people are holding causing only miners to be selling what they mine as they have to pay their electricity bill. This is causing a HUGE drop in prices and they WILL drop for another three weeks at least. Things will not get better and like a true investor you have to get out before losing all your net worth and jump back in later when things will be improving saving you a huge amount.

You can only do the Visa cards up to a maximum amount. You can not buy more than a certain amount in one transaction due to the risk of money laundering.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:03:30
Fees such as???
@_date: 2014-10-20 17:02:06
Add to the fact that bitcoin is an ever growing ledger of transactions, introducing more people will cause the blockchain to grow into the terabytes level. Imagine a retailer wanting to join it, without using coinbase or other services which charge fees, and having to download the whole blockchain to join. Not a pretty site.

So 4chan is taking cash while this new company absorbs bitcoins. Boo.
@_date: 2014-10-02 23:19:54
Then why are you in that bank and not a credit union or another bank which does not have that fee. I'm part of a credit union and a bank and neither have this fee. Research before joining a crappy bank like BoA. The top 3 banks in the US care for their members if they have over $10,000 in worth. They want the low level holders to leave through fees. Some people like the op of this chain is one of the guys who is not getting the hint. &gt;.&gt; 
TL;DR: Use a different bank.
@_date: 2014-11-14 21:23:10
I never said that... I said the receiver or business getting the transfer is not trusted.

Stop trying to catch the falling knife. If you can not afford to buy 5 whole coins right now stop and wait to buy another after some more falling has occurred. There will always be bitcoin in a year or two and the price is currently trending downwards. Hold off on any more purchases until some more stabilization occurs.
@_date: 2015-01-14 05:25:37
It is the psychological sense that you can stop the fall at any time by ending the game, in this case selling, but you choose to explore how far you are willing to take yourself mentally. It is like holding a loaded revolver to your foot and slowly pulling the trigger to see just how far you are willing to pull it before you quit. 
The answer is if you are not stable you will pull the trigger all the way. If you know there will be further falling, and there should be for a few more hours, sell to save a few percent of your loss and buy in later.
