"Will be up" Oh so it doesnt exist yet and isnt up 100% yet? Then your words mean nothing.

That's what you always say. That's what people were saying early 2014, that's what people are going to be saying late 2015 if bitcoin is still around. And guess what, its still going to be JUST AS VOLATILE.

This just sounds like you trying to make yourself feel better about possibly losing a ton of money. "I'm not doing it for myself, I'm doing it for the better of the community", give me a break your in it for the money just like everyone else when it comes down to it.

The easiest way I know as a person who doesn't research bitcoin to actually get bitcoin is Coinbase. If I don't put a credit card with it, then it takes something like four days to get my coins. That's the reason why bitcoin will never take off, it doesn't matter about the price, it doesn't matter about something silly like Open Bazaar, the fact is it's 100x easier to get anything I want by just putting my debt card on a site I trust wwaaayyyy more then something like OB. Until I can buy  bitcoin the second I want it, its worthless.

Not really, someone is still losing money. If it's not the end user, then it's Godfreee which means eventually he's going to lose too much to keep going.

No that's stupid, those words all have definitions. It's like if I call you a retard, but what I meant was smart, those words don't mean the same thing. I shouldn't have to explain that to you but....

Why do you guys call each other cults, it just makes you look silly. I can't take either side seriously. On one hand though "buttcoin" doesn't want to be taken seriously and is just bored people fucking with other people, and on the other hand you guys are so threatened by a tiny subreddit that you worry they'll devalue your currency. How can you ever expect bitcoin to be taken seriously when this is what I see when I come here. It's just like little kids bickering.

Is that really the solution you're using here? Because bitcoin will never take off if that's the only way you can do transactions that's ridiculous if you're buying anything but drugs.
