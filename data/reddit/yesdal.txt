"Got in" when 60 bitcoins was worth a 100 grams of hash, or  ~420usd.  A day later there were no bitcoins left, only shitty hash...
Bought more in January this year, thank god

Hi! or God dag :)
How do i steal this sheet? Do I have to apply for rights to change the document or is there an easier way?
@_date: 2017-01-19 09:07:50
Worked great :) Thanks!

I did the math a month ago. BTC is not very profitable at all  to mine BUT nicehash offers some kind of a mining power-selling service where they pay a good amount.
So if you bought say a gtx 1080, it would take 6 months to turn profit, IF you have free electricity. If not free, then expect a longer time. [Check nicehash profitability calculator](
As others have mentioned you should probably just buy bitcoin :)

Looks good dude :) 
BUT is it possible to add my crypto portfolio without inputting my wallet adresses?

So far I was thinking bitfinex, but then i searched for them on this subreddit and boy did people NOT like them at all....
@_date: 2017-11-23 08:54:52
What makes your site better then f.ex Gdax, Bitfinex and Bitstamp?
@_date: 2017-11-23 10:15:35
Your exchange looks good and simple enough to use with some trading experience. 
My issue here is that I want the price to be shown in USD, not in EUR
@_date: 2017-11-15 12:01:53
Yeah thats kinda what i meant.
Would be great to f.ex put in :bought X LTC on date 02.11.2017 for price Y. And then be able to track the gainz based on average exchange price at that moment. 
Imagine how awesome it would be to have an app where you can track your whole crypto-portfolio at once. Maybe this sort of thing exist already?
