K8 Poker is currently our top rated Bitcoin Poker site, so after setting up and account under Tyler Jones, I decided to play one of the many Bitcoin Poker Freerolls available. Long story short I manged to come 4th out of a total of nearly 50 players! This meant I got a payout of 6 chips from the total 50 chips that were paid out. I have to say it was a lot of fun and if you play K8 Poker you may see me playing under the name Tyler Jones, so say hello :)
It has been a while since I played Online Poker, and I was a big fan of Online Poker before the US government seemingly destroyed that world in 2011 (but that is another story). So I am really excited to see Poker sites solely dealing in Bitcoins. I am confident and hopeful that the Online Poker community will grow again and mainly in the Bitcoin and Altcoin arena! I will be watching this space closely!
