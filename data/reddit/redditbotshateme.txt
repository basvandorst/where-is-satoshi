I had to fly to a part of my country that had an embassy that would do it.  I had to use credit cards to make the flight and stayed in a backpackers for two days.  All up it probably cost me 5k to renounce.  Not to mention the US consulate staff were extremely hostile and rude.  Probably one of the worst experiences I ever had.  I've never felt more violated, to think a country I have not set foot in for 20yrs and never was going to again was claiming 'ownership' of me made me feel like I had zero human rights to live a normal life.  Anyway, I could go on but no, it is not easy or cheap.  Also after renouncing you must prove compliance for previous 6yrs with the IRS.  I tried to do this on my own and it was too complicated (if you screw up you could be fined $100,000's of dollars), so I tried to get an expat tax attorney.  The cheapest they could do it was $6,000, so to this day I still haven't done it as I don't have that kind of money.  So who knows what will happen to my life in the future.  All I can do is never set foot in the USA and hope I can continue to live my life with my foreign family.

You're way off base.  Over 8 million US expats are living in hell right now due to FATCA and IRS compliance for citizen based taxation.  Many are accidental Americans that never once set foot in the USA or even knew they were a "US Person".  Most US expats like 99.9999% are poor ass bastards like me, we are not "FAT CATS" and we don't even have funds for hiring expat attorneys to manage this ultra complex compliance (most of the specialists can't even figure it out).  meanwhile these true fat cats you speak of hiding trillions could care less.  They have the money to slip through all the loopholes.  Meanwhile 8 million US expats are thrown under the bus and basically screwed unless they renounce citizenship (which I had to do btw thanks to this).
