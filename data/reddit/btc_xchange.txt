It seems like most countries are taking a "wait-and-see" approach, but as more and more people begin using bitcoin, countries will be forced to accept it as a form of legal tender.

Yes. I've seen the Huobi volume. However, was referring to BTC China trade volume, which fell from 55,000 (average from October to December). We haven't seen anything as significant since.

Only issue with buying/selling of Bitcoin is the number of days it takes for the transaction to be finalized. 
Our company, works to reduce this lengthy duration by providing a concierge service for those buying/selling Bitcoin (UK only for now). Feel free to check out our platform. Would love to get some feedback.

Looks simple enough but I need to get it on my iPhone: Apple needs to remove their restrictions.
Bitmonetq, we wrote you up on our Bitcoin Weekly Update blog post. Would love to know your thoughts on our overall mission:

Thanks for your comment. Will keep this in mind for future reference.

Very true. But we only focus on the most significant events. And within those events, we focus on the events that will help promote the ease and use of Bitcoin. Hence, we left out the GHash.IO story: thankfully though, their market share plunged to below 30%..... still too large though.

Not a Troll. Just trying to spread some Bitcoin love. Not sure why my Karma has gone downhill :(
If you could explain, that would be great!

Bitcoin isn't only being bought by speculators. They are many who buy bitcoins for use in regular day trade/transactions.

Like every novel item, there's a huge fervor in the first moments which will eventually subside. But one must ignore short-term fluctuations and focus on the long-term trend. 
No one expects the $125,000/24 hours rate to continue: that would be ludicrous. But there is high hopes and strong evidence that a continuous increase in Bitcoin related transactions will continue (whether it be on Overstock.com or via other vendors).
Feel free to check out our blog. Many of our blogs show the day to day applicable use of Bitcoin, in our times today:

Not bad for 24hours: $125,000 in BTC transactions, over 780 orders.

I was referring to buying and selling of Bitcoin itself. From bitcoin exchanges. Not Bitcoin vendors.

Thanks for the heads up! Definitely a huge news event.

Is there a problem with us wanting to keep the Bitcoin community informed? "Spam" would have been more like "Visit.... to get your free Bitcoin now"

You're 100% right. Bitcoin was "obviously fake" until the major news agencies started reporting on it in 2011.
