He probably has a buttload of bitcoin and is spreading FUD to get even more on the cheap 
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:37:42
If they added doge as an option, would have picked up at least 30%
@_date: 2017-12-05 01:31:45
Warren Buffett is a big proponent of HODL

How will the bank owned lightning network set anyone free?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:08:19
That's kind of a weird argument if you just built a giant coal fired plant....
@_date: 2017-12-21 08:28:18
I like bitcoin cash and I like your comment. 
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:13:30
Why wouldn't you keep your BCH as a hedge? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:33:10
I figured that the only reason bitcoin cash has low fees and faster transactions is because less people are using it? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:05
Yeah only it's not like you can aggregate those 600 hours and go on a vacation. Good on you for quitting and putting that cash in BTC :"��
@_date: 2017-12-20 15:58:27
I'm still not sure how they somehow managed to classify bitcoin as a security and not a currency...
@_date: 2017-12-04 04:33:27
Is it asking them to buy Gulden instead?
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:56:44
By Entanglement do they mean IOTA?!
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:56:42
What if I have binance and Walton - do those even have wallets? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:26:51
Thanks dudes �� 
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:45:54
Very specific comparison...
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:04:16
You can put in buy or sell orders...
@_date: 2017-09-10 23:26:47
There's goldmoney.com however that's kind of like bitpay, except for gold.
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:13:32
Amen brother 
@_date: 2017-09-22 07:14:44
Bro... +1 for fallout reference 
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:56:47
What about direct P2P exchange using a phone app?
@_date: 2017-09-29 19:19:31
Kraken has separate 2 FA for trade and withdraw ��
@_date: 2017-09-14 10:44:44
This... isn't the government the people? 
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:11:55
That's my approach - just buy a bit each week and when it tanks buy a lot more 
@_date: 2017-09-16 00:21:53
Iota is quantum proof...
@_date: 2017-09-15 20:45:30
Did we just become best friends? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 04:50:13
There exchanges that do this 
@_date: 2017-09-15 10:26:51
Thanks dudes �� 
@_date: 2017-09-16 07:41:34
It's all interrelated 
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:54:50
Not so super Mario
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:34:18
 But the exchange stores your bitcoin in a secure wallet - so how would those coins be impacted? I don't know so looking for an explanation, ELI5. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:21:31
That is an excellent point 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:36:23
Melania? 
@_date: 2017-05-30 05:32:44
No deposit fees - nice!
@_date: 2017-05-31 21:18:11
@_date: 2017-05-25 03:14:21
Well good for him? 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:22:24
Just avoid coinmama- you'll get beaten up every time 
@_date: 2017-05-26 19:21:58
But if you want to do a quick deal cex.io I like better
@_date: 2017-07-04 07:28:43
Guy is totally rational on this 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:52:24
I'm ok with a return to average of about 900 to 1100 per BTC
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:48:59
That's why you would get that hallway robot from robocop 
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:00:18
Doge millions time 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:30:09
As in turn into litecoin or doge? ��
@_date: 2017-07-19 03:08:36
That's probably the case - they are busy signing up new users 
@_date: 2017-07-17 01:56:46
Haha ok easy to say that in hindsight. 
@_date: 2017-07-10 04:27:42
Good point - sending money is a huge pain in the butt - plus some jackass gets paid just to switch the currency for you - like wtf 
@_date: 2017-07-12 20:31:34
Is bip148 a different coin? It would still show up as BTC on the exchange no?
@_date: 2017-07-24 20:28:58
So then just claim the BCC?
@_date: 2017-07-17 02:50:39
10 years ago there was no iPhone - so think about that in terms of exponential change 
@_date: 2017-07-14 08:46:25
I think the issue is that banks would make multiple loans against the same bitcoin. It's exactly how gold lending started - look it up.
@_date: 2017-07-24 19:08:06
It could be the value just evens out across the two currencies 
@_date: 2017-07-20 01:24:20
I don't get the "this is gentlemen" sign. Is this a meme? ��‍♀️
@_date: 2017-05-26 10:36:48
The spread is gigantic 
@_date: 2017-06-25 01:18:56
Back to $100 please!
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:19:33
Hey not all alt coins are shitcoins. 
@_date: 2017-06-15 05:30:57
So it's time to sell BTC and buy DOGE?! �� 
@_date: 2017-06-21 23:55:51
Doge is awesome - if anything you should buy more!
@_date: 2017-06-29 00:51:11
@_date: 2017-06-06 00:18:04
Decent advice - bitcoin is a good add to a portfolio - it is volatile and if you can't handle that volatility...
@_date: 2017-06-18 08:59:51
So you like paying $2+ dollars per transaction? Such expensive!
@_date: 2017-06-28 18:21:02
It has 4 legs to be be exact ��
@_date: 2017-06-22 09:41:25
It's also very low on HolyTransactions. I was buying something with BTC and I got a "mining fee is so low your payment might get rejected". 
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:14:46
Good, it'll go down and then buy more.
@_date: 2017-06-28 05:38:34
Haha ok is this ransomware from 2011?
@_date: 2017-06-22 07:17:23
 It available in NZ at all... ever
@_date: 2017-06-22 19:45:25
Nope the sending fee is very reasonable :)
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:25:53
I use it but am trying to figure out how to transfer to a wallet off the exchange: it's either not straightforward or I'm a dumbass.
@_date: 2017-06-30 06:03:09
The spread is super high on localbitcoins, otherwise it's a cool way of buying them. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 04:59:43
Doge is awesome, show some respects 
@_date: 2017-06-21 07:48:24
"Horrendous bear" - hyperbole much?
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:00:15
You should see what happens with 10M or higher! ��
@_date: 2017-06-22 03:58:50
You can also call em satoshii 
@_date: 2017-06-16 00:22:10
14 dollar ether - daaaaaaaamn
@_date: 2017-06-30 03:32:53
Sell it all!
@_date: 2017-06-28 07:38:48
So what you're saying is $11.0 DOGE!! ��
@_date: 2017-07-20 06:09:11
Maybe a solid crash will shake out bad players 
@_date: 2017-06-23 08:17:25
I got a response from kraken support in like a day - pretty fast imo
@_date: 2017-06-27 09:40:56
Wonder if dan bilzerian is sweating or hodling?
@_date: 2017-06-29 02:23:59
99% �� 1% bitcoin +/- 1% error
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:17:54
He spread at localbitcoins is pretty nuts though 
@_date: 2017-06-22 05:11:39
Super Satoshii!!
@_date: 2017-06-19 07:49:14
Similar to "if you had invested dollars into Apple vs. buying each new iPhone" chart
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:21:08
Unmmm so bitcoin is evil tanks now?
@_date: 2017-06-22 08:09:58
Settle down...
@_date: 2017-06-22 00:15:24
The volume must be insane - good luck dudes
@_date: 2017-06-06 08:56:13
Hope yo find it dude 
@_date: 2017-06-22 18:32:06
The difference between market price and the buy and sell prices. For example, if BTC market price is 2500, the cost for you to buy might be 2700 and to sell 2300. 
@_date: 2017-06-18 05:00:19
Doge is even faster
