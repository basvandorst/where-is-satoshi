Bitcoin’s price reached such a high level for the first time in late November 2013, soon after the arrest of Ross Ulbricht, the founder of the infamous Silk Road, in October 2013 when the BTC price faced a sharp decline to $80. However, such a huge jump in price in less than two months was caused by speculations of Mt.Gox bots and rapid popularization of cryptocurrency in China. The speculative nature of the bubble was too obvious, and it soon burst. The situation we observe now is completely different. During 2016, Bitcoin grew slowly, same as the interest of investors in digital currency. Regulator attitudes towards the existence and use of cryptocurrency are becoming less negative, compared to previous years. While the economic situation in Latin American countries, India and China forces their citizens to search for alternative payment systems, like cryptocurrency.  
It will accelerate after we breach the all time high because that is just how it works. Take the time and track back every all time high that bitcoin has ever hit. If you notice, in every incident that the all time high had eventually been breached to the upside (after selling off for months beforehand) that this is exactly where new money comes in, and we race upwards to the next bubble high. Since it has happened in every incident (plus I watch this same pattern in stocks every day), I expect that this time will follow suit and repeat the same pattern.
