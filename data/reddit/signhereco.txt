I like it; I've thought about that idea too. Unless you have the resources/knowledge to open a boutique computer/electronics store, it would be very difficult to generate any real revenue at this point in time.  I think Crypto ATM's are a better investment right now.  A couple popped up at my local college campus and they spread the word just from being there.  One got kind of infamous because it was tucked into this really cutty spot under a stairwell.  The fees are crazy, but it gets used.  The other is in a popular cafe where I'm sure it acts as a conversation piece for the heavily-caffeinated.

What I mean is that if you are not a gamer, it's reckless to invest in Doge.  DogeCoin is a blatant joke.

The negative-externality of mining bitcoin can be offset by using renewable power for miners.  People are still willing to pay for coal/gas power to run miners though.  Unfortunately, power consumed by mining cryptocurrency will continue to increase over time.

There's still that record though...  Bitcoin is not the answer to a transactable or private crypto - another coin will come to reign in that arena.

The bug surfacing in the wake of net neutrality repeal is definitely odd.  It doesn't look like scrypt (CPU-based) mining will be affected too greatly, which was my initial concern.  I think it's a matter of seeing how drastic of an effect the patches will have on the internet in general.
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:03:28
BTC would move down with the crash.  Hopefully it drops far enough to sting so people actually do some research amidst the chaos. Crash kills off some bad altcoins, possibly consolidates others. Investors get smarter, BTC and altcoins rally and continue to appreciate long-term.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:21:32
You don't get consumer protection with cash either, it's give and take. I don't think you understand cryptocurrency that well if you're suggesting that centralized banks should or could create their own coins. The hypothetical coin you're describing sounds exactly like fiat currency (inflate and create more when needed). Maybe cryptocurrency just isn't for you.

Only buy bitmain products from bitmain. For *so* many reasons.  
I don't know anything about current GPUs.  I built a rig years ago, good experience and much lower risk than an ASIC because you can resell or use the GPUs.  I don't think it's profitable to mine BTC with GPUs anymore.  Are you thinking of mining ETH or selling hashing power?

You're going to want to go to the [bitmain support site]( - you should go ahead and bookmark this site now if you're planning on doing business with them because you'll be opening a lot of tickets to find out why your order is marked invalid/unpaid after you just wired $2500 to Hong Kong, where the f--k your power supply is a month after you receive the S9, or any of countless other issues you're bound to encounter.  Open a ticket asking when the next S9 preorder is (down to hours/minutes/time zone, if they can).  If they don't get back to you, get used to it, and open another ticket.  Be ready to place your order the minute the preorder opens up.  I think they give you 7 days to pay; send your transfer ASAP and get them **all** the proof, then open *another* ticket with all that same proof and send that to them.  The name of the game is accuracy, persistence, and thoroughness.  My last tip is that if you're really serious, order 1 or 2 APW3++ power supplies now, so you're not left staring at a cold miner.  If one PSU is defective, you'll either have to pay double for one on ebay or wait another 2 months for bitmain to ship one, but if they both work, you can sell one for double (probably more if you time it right) on ebay.  Hope this helps and good luck!

The general problem with available choices is that there are too many choices, like you acknowledged already.  At this point, you probably wouldn't be able to get a decent hashrate on a new scrypt/sha256/x11 blockchain.  You could make a new Ethereum token in an hour, but there are already 18,000 different tokens.  It seems to me like ICO's are more about the businesses that *depend* on the related coins now anyway (ie. the Brave browser and BAT).  If you want to do something for crypto, help develop the infrastructure.  Make a tool for consolidating small coins, establish a reputable crypto-related service, sell hardware, whatever. A new coin just won't help anyone, including yourself, right now.

They could absolutely do that. My logic is that they would not ban the production of miners even if mining itself was banned. Also, I don't think China really cares about the environment that much; they *have* however, decided that they do not want the energy they produce to be allocated towards mining, even by their citizens.

It's worth it to be patient and buy from bitmain.  It would make sense to buy any other computer from the most convenient seller, but ASICs are different because they can only do *one* specific task.  Let's say you find a seller that isn't selling a fake/broken/tampered with/used miner - that 90 day warranty from bitmain is going to be expired.  You're going to run the risk of the hardware developing a problem that you can't diagnose or fix. ASICs are a big investment, do it the right way (through the manufacturer) and be patient.  There are too many scams related to everything crypto right now to gamble on a top-of-the-line ASIC that you presumably hope to profit from for years.
Also, do a little research on the L3+, scrypt mining is good stuff.

The US government tries to keep a watchful eye on its citizens and keep things stable to a degree, but I think you're still giving them too much credit. Sure they do some shady shit, but  they also look out for the citizens paying their bills and working for them. There's just so much more to the big picture - Rockefellers, Rothschilds, The Fed (which the US federal government is *not* in control of), The Central Bank, the super-elite in general. And that feeling you get of being monitored could probably be more attributed to corporations like Google, Facebook, an Apple who don't have to answer to any government - to me that's even scarier.

No, because the blockchain is built upon itself and it's decentralized. Nobody would have got onboard if some backdoor doomsday device was written into the code like that.
The sewing machine story is interesting, but it's a different scenario entirely. I'm not suggesting that the price of BTC has never been manipulated, but Bitcoin is much more complicated than that example.

I don't know about a full-on bull run, but July always seems to be a profitable month. I know it's simple, but it's a pattern nonetheless.

I didn't know anyone still believed in HODL. So if you somehow knew BTC would rise 15% tomorrow and then fall  25% the day after that, you'd just hold and lose money?

I'm glad HODLing and investing everything in BTC has worked out well enough for you that you can afford move entirely to a decentralized system. u/ehanoc is right though, you're closed-minded and condescending. It sounds like you don't work for a paycheck anymore, so in your case, yes, HODLing is the "true believer" move right now. You're being hypocritical by calling people fiat-minded while you're forex trading to pay your bills.
I personally agree with you that BTC will not fail and will continue to grow. For the average person right now, especially late adopters, HODL does not make sense in the same way it does for you. You're either saying it does because you're failing to see other perspectives (again) or selfishly trying to convince others to help protect your decision to convert so early.

Sounds good to me. IMO that would bring it down to a realistic value, hopefully push some sharks away for long enough to have another decent run, and bring in fresh blood. The whales and institutions are just toying with Main St. at this price.

You're advertising your business. This isn't supporting BTC in any way. Anyone can make a tshirt, man up and pay for advertising if you think your basic shirts are so great. I just reported all you spam shitposts. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:29:55
Lol. I think the benefits outweigh the risks. They make such good fakes now that the cops will scan them and give them back to you.

Buyer sounds like an idiot. That sucks. 
Edit: He doesn't deserve a return.  Ebay sells thousands of Antminers and hardly any of them are sold as a package with the PSU.  It's his own fault.

That's kind of what BTC futures contracts are. You obviously can't keep unmined bitcoin in a wallet.
@_date: 2018-03-02 01:19:42
Obvious scam.
@_date: 2018-03-02 22:16:47
Yes, until the price of BTC changes.  Then you'll either make money, or have to buy more to make the purchase.  
What drugs are you buying???
@_date: 2018-02-22 23:19:38
This has nothing to do with bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-02-11 18:03:19
I don't like any of your shirts. They're really plain and basic. It looks like you threw it together in 5 minutes on customink or some other online printing service and you're just marking them up and trying to sell them. Your account is brand new, you've contributed nothing to reddit and now you want people to support you. Reddit isn't your personal billboard.

Quit begging and posting wallet addresses

No it's not.

I'm more inclined to spend BCH right now because I want to get rid of it and I believe it's a shitfork. I got a bunch after the hard fork and basically just used it to transfer quickly between exchanges these last few months.
@_date: 2018-02-11 17:11:47
Quit advertising shirts on here.

It's just begging to get keyed.

Did you just buy the dip at 9k and make 20 bucks or something?
@_date: 2018-07-04 03:15:00
Wouldn't Bitcoin have to be centralized for a system like this to be organized and enacted?

It was just honest feedback. You're welcome. There are rules that you're breaking with your posts. I suggest you take the time to read them if you really want to support this site or cryptocurrencies via this site.

Nah, there's no bcash on it

There also the whole realm of forward-thinking visionaries who got in early, gamers who wanted to pay off GPUs by mining, hippies who were moving trips, seeds, and spores, programmers and computer enthusiasts - the list goes on. There's balance in everything.
 No one here cares if you think BTC is morally dirty or choose not to invest. It will be your loss.
