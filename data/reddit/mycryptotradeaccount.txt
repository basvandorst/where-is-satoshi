I get that even if I almost never comment in these subreddits it is generally better to heavily support BTC in this sub and BCH in the other one even if the reality is more complex than that, I honestly expected my post to be heavily downvoted by people like the first guy (other than you) who downvoted me, that's a good surprise

I would have sued, you shouldn't feel bad for the employee.
He/she deserved well more than being fired, the pressure is not a good excuse for doing shady shit and blindly executing what you're told to do doesn't make you less responsible of your actions
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:27:56
That would go against the idea of crypto itself

ALLOW US TO SELL

If he traded it depends on the country, I know that in my country it is fine until you cash out, then you have to pay a  percentage on your gains. I'm not from the US though and many comments I read there in the last months made me think that's not the case for US traders

Working now, sell now before the big dip

No-one but in many places regulations are more flexible

My point is just that there were reasons for what happened and the fork was internal to the Bitcoin community so both deserve to use the Bitcoin name even I don't own any of them.
I personally attack those who use Bcash outside the Bitcoin subreddit and those who use Bitcoin Core name outside the btc subreddit as both were created for valid reasons.
Unfortunately most new users don't know what happened at the time but I think it's right to tell them how the things used to be.
@_date: 2019-07-07 20:41:17
I own 0 BCH and 0 BTC, I am mostly in ETH, your (both) environment is toxic.
There were valid reasons for the fork, you guys should respect BCH and they should respect you, the community has been divided by different ideologies and both are respectable. Don't make this look like a religious schism please
@_date: 2019-07-07 17:39:01
You should read the other side of the story, what you read here is only one side and it fits their narrative.
Both the subs were for BTC, at the time a big part of the community was supporting increasing the block size but most of the core developers were in some way working for a company called Blockstream which had hired them.
Blockstream was working on 2nd layer solutions and increasing the block size would have damaged their business, maybe without any reason the core developers working for them didn't support this change and it never really become a reality.
At the time the mods of the Bitcoin sub started deleting comments and banning users supporting raising the block size, there are still a lot of screens of user banned which complained against it in the btc sub and this is why there is still a lot of hate, most of the banned users moved to btc complaining about the censorship.
Then BCH was born, it was a fork made by some of those who supported raising the block size, some of them decided to stick with BTC regardless.
To undermine BCH the Bitcoin sub started calling Bitcoin Cash Bcash to undermine it by removing the Bitcoin name from it, the BCH community then started calling BTC Bitcoin Core and now there is still a strong division among the communities.

Flexible meaning that if you're under a certain limit you don't have to declare anything.
Over that it's your responsibility to pay but you don't have to do calculations on every trade, you only pay while cashing out... Or you can move to a country with a better taxation without having to renounce to your citizenship -in the last case you can't do that the day before cashing out of course-

He's a troll or an idiot, it's pointless, read his history
@_date: 2019-11-25 10:59:12
Yawn, I do not support BCH either even if it would fit your narrative. The fact that you call it Bcash is an evidence that politeness is not one of your strengths, if you know the history of the word.
I do not support it but I don't use that name in the same way as I didn't mock other kids using nicknames invented by the bullies in my high school years.
Using nicknames to mock those who are not part of your group is also typical of cults, even if you don't support a coin you can criticize it in a constructive and technical way without resorting to childish behaviours.
The blindness of you guys is astonishing, there was no technical reason not to allow the network to scale, if you didn't like raising the block size you could have implemented a different upgrade after reaching consensus keeping the network decentralised but no, you decided that it was better to develop a centralised second layer.
Storage is getting more and more cheaper every year as Satoshi knew so anyone would have been able to host a node even with upgrades, in any case, the poorest people are not going to host nodes for Bitcoin if they can't even afford to use the network itself.
Just to let you know, being unable to improve is not positive, the whole human history proves it.
Being hard and expensive to move is not good for a digital asset, the only problem is that since BTC has first mover advantage and multiple pairs it can drag the whole market with it.
I would love to hear more people in the Bitcoin community interested in finding alternative solutions instead of blindly following what they're told. You can reopen this debate or new ones whenever you want.
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:00:06
Blame? Your group is not sacred and I did not committ a sin by leaving it.
If you are in a group of people and you see a large portion of them behaving in a way that you find unacceptable and childish leaving is the best choice and I absolutely do not regret it.
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:07:36
I'll ignore the conspiracies and the victimisation at the end of your comment.
The presence of hubs itself is a pure form of centralisation, you could argue that it's still fairly decentralised for you and we could discuss about it, at a certain point it would become matter of opinions if the system is "enough" decentralised.
Of course I would lie if I said that the system is absolutely centralised but I don't think that you could argue that any other form of L1 scaling would have been less centralised than this L2 scaling. 
I was and still am a great supporter of L1 scaling and I'm talking in general terms and not only about Bitcoin, L2s can be used and are good for certain use cases but they are a worse solution.
My problem is: BTC has settled for a worse solution when there were better ones, I also discovered that the community was not anymore open to discussion but really hostile.
@_date: 2019-11-25 07:40:47
This sub killed Bitcoin during the block size debate years ago.
Now you're left with a split community where both sides are toxic and a hard to implement centralised solution as the last hope.
The only thing left to be happy about is some random shop accepting BTC through a third party service, of course, you wouldn't use L1 for a normal transaction but apparently that's good.
I'm really sad because I greatly supported BTC years ago and I followed it even more closely before the fork.
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:29:56
The tone at the time became really aggressive really fast, the community split and immediately those who were friends and part of the same community became "the enemy", it looked a lot like a religious schism even if this was supposed to be a tech sub.
There were terrible campaigns to mock the others, I despise the name "Bcash" because it was born exactly for that reason, really, it wasn't a good environment
@_date: 2019-11-25 12:53:27
I see around 4500 on two explorers and your same number on another, anyway, yes, the system is by its very nature more centralised than the base layer, it also adds unnecessary complexity.
@_date: 2019-11-25 11:32:26
People like you are the reason why I left BTC, I remember the Bitcoin.com drama, the hacks, the BTC influencers pushing the name Bcash to mock half of the community, the bans... It was a shitshow on both sides.
I think you can't read, I never mentioned 1gb block sizes, there were multiple possibilities; raising the block size wasn't even the only solution, there were multiple possible alternatives being discussed at the time that didn't include a centralised second layer but you conveniently forget that.
My point was to push this community to discuss about LN and about the alternatives to this system since my impression is that most of the people here are not even exploring possible alternatives.
Other than that, again, you're conveniently trying to interpret my comment as an attack on your group, this is just herd mentality: cults should try to use it to exploit others, I consider myself a reasonable human being and not a sheep, if you want to use these shameful psychological tactics you probably don't deserve to discuss with me. If you want to continue this discussion keep it serious and don't act like a teenage spoiled brat, otherwise you won't have further answers.
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:09:27
At the current state it is not advisable to move your funds with BTC. Use LTC or ETH, they are generally accepted everywhere too
@_date: 2019-06-11 18:00:37
So basically a world where the richest don't pay any tax and the poors which are forced to pay taxes to have a chance to survive won't be able to sustain the system alone.
That's a terrible and egoistic world, a great favour to the 1%

Short BTCUSD

Close short
Rebuy BTC at a lower price

I am wondering if the users are going sell the BTCs they will get

A market only made of holders doesn't make any sense but a market of only traders is exactly the same, both are important but currently most people are just trying to time the market buying and selling. 
Holders are highly beneficial to everyone so demonizing them is at least unfair, it is true that long term investors should only buy when the market is low but it is hard to understand which is the best time to buy otherwise we would all be rich... So everyone would be poor; holders are just making a choice: not to invest much of their time in trading something they think will be more valuable in the future, there is nothing wrong with that and removing coins from the market is actually beneficial to everyone
@_date: 2018-12-28 22:33:24
So more human misery and more money? 
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:57:32
Debatable, if we had more holders instead of improvised Gordon Gekkos this environment would be far better.
@_date: 2018-12-07 19:02:16
No, I mean the cryptocurrencies environment, the market is just a part of that.
Holders don't create selling pressure so the more holders there are the more everyone can benefit, traders on one hand provide liquidity but on the other hand they are not invested for the long term so they buy and sell according to the trend (or about the future movement they expect) creating harsher spikes
