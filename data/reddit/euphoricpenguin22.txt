I did. r/Monero vs r/Bitcoin 1v1

Speaking of Bitcoin, Monero...
*(Inside joke)*

Don't mean to start some crypto flame wars, but Monero is both more secure, more fair with mining, and the team works very hard to keep the feels so low the smallest of microtransactions don't even hurt. Also, there's an unlimited supply. So, who really comes out on top? You tell me.

I guess, but won't the alg changes help? They do those one or twice a year...

How are you even in this subreddit, if you don't know about the basic principles of top 10 altcoins?!?
It uses the CryptoNight PoW alg, which is from CryptoNote. Basically it favors CPU over OP GPUs and, of course, ASICs. There are now regular alg changes to keep fees lower, and to fend off ASICs, so the claims hold true.
The team keeps fees low as said above.
An unlimited supply is *arguably* better, but not nessecarily. Monero will never face the day where the finite supply runs out, and mining halts, meaning everyone will be stuck with Bitcoin, and no place to send it. Once that happens, the price will crash. Monero? Unlimited saves the day.

Also just give some people paper wallets with *something* on.
@_date: 2017-09-17 20:46:04
Nope. I seriously printed out an excessive amount of Bitcoin paper wallets to give to people. If you don't want to donate anything, don't donate. It's as simple as that. Nope. I don't even have a clue where I would waste bitcoins. All I care about is getting them. I want to just mess around with and get my feet wet in some transactions.
