Sort of silly since you can argue brute force and wars probably involved a ton of effort and money;)

Sure, I'm certain that's what he meant but he didn't really qualify so it's funny.

I knew this one was coming as soon as I posted...;) Either that or "are you saying reddit isn't mainstream?"
I meant as a content creator posting content, not as a user on a discussion site. I don't use YouTube. I do use Twitter, but I didn't realize until today that ChangeTip was there, and I've never seen anyone actually use it anywhere other than here on reddit.

It's pretty basic trading. If you buy something at $1.00 and the price moves up to $1.10, you can sell and pocket $0.10. Then the price drops again to $1.00, and you buy again and repeat.
Because the prices are fluctuating so much, there is a lot of this going on. There's no reason to hold on to Bitcoin if you 1) believe it's risky and 2) are confident that you know where the price is about to move. You can just buy (or short) it and then liquidate it as soon as you think the price is optimal, and sit back in "safe" currency and wait to repeat the process.
That's pretty much the difference between day trading and investing, by the way. Investors hold, traders don't.

Fair enough! I guess we'll find out how it goes...

Having built software for at least one Bitcoin exchange and having an idea of how much business they do and what that looks like, I disagree. There are a ton of "day traders" out there that have no idea what they're doing, and a lot of people out there eager to take advantage of that.
EDIT: Just to clarify, I agree that in a lot of cases day trading isn't "justified" - I just disagree that it means that most of the volume on exchanges aren't people doing it. People aren't very rational overall.

Agreed. Soundcloud is the first "mainstream" site I'm on that will have this. Maybe deviantart can be one of the next ones - that would be pretty cool.

This is an intellectually lazy answer. Lack of knowledge doesn't automatically mean something is a scam - lots of people who know nothing about Bitcoin itself think it's a scam, but that doesn't make it so.

If Satoshi is an individual with an academic background, he might have written "we" by habit (or it may have felt awkward to him to not do so). It doesn't require a current association with an institution to explain this.

Gridcoin has an anonymous founder. It's an occasional point of contention where people try to argue that somehow it's not trustworthy (even though it's fully open-source on github like everything else) because nobody knows who the founder is.
