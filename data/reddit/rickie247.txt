He would need to convince his shareholders for that.
@_date: 2019-02-05 17:32:32
It actually works that way. In fact, all that’s needed is adding a conditional to the source code. Problem is that one would need “Buy in” consensus from developers, miners, and most importantly those who accept and hold Bitcoin.
Obtaining the majority vote on decisions/changes is as much of a Democracy as it gets.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:21:53
Agree as well. Unfortunately for those who do not understand basic economic principles, in order to achieve what BTC is meant to achieve, A Peer-To-Peer Electronic Cash, there must be inflation. Otherwise, it’s problematic for merchants to accept the currency due to the cheer speculative impact that its capped supply has on each unit’s price.
Also, code is law, so implementing an inflationary scheme to BTC is possible. One controlled by code determining the amount of inflation. One decided by those involved [devs, traders, users].
@_date: 2019-02-10 12:39:45
Agree. Implementing a system which could automatically assess the S&amp;D could create a very dynamic yet efficient and fair inflation implementation into BTC’s protocol. But such a thing is too far ahead of its time right now. Extremely hard to obtain consensus on such. Time will tell.

Haha ask him what’s his plan with the BTC purchased. If its for long term and is he’s not actively trading, find a way to convince him that he’s better of by keeping it in a cold wallet that he has full control of.
I think that if you explain to him that he can save his private key(s) in multiple formats (e.g., paper and a USB drive) which he can then use to access it at a later time will do.
Also, unless he’s planning to give it to you, create a cold wallet that only he controls.

Also agree and wish that transaction fees are enough to maintain miners happy to secure the network. But this can create a problem of running into a situation where spending $20 at a grocery store suicide as the transaction cost is $15. Imagine that. Similar situation took place when the trading frenzy happened back in Dec. of 2017 - Jan. 2018
On the other hand, chips are becoming smaller and more powerful each day that goes by and thus, the cost of mining could become so low that anyone could have equal chance at maintaining the network in exchange of a big enough (low effort) incentive.

First, those actively tweeting and engaging with content about digital currencies get the message. Seems like you don’t. That’s fine 
Second, seems like you took a personal stance towards a topic that is important to consider and discuss. Remember what bitcoin is: A PEER TO PEER CASH SYSTEM. And thus, it is bound by economic principles.

Doge has almost the same 24hr volume as BTC (in % to circulating supply)
As of today:
Dodge 24hr volume 6.27% of total supply 
Bitcoin 24 hr volume 8.74% of total supply
@_date: 2019-02-05 18:03:27
It’s obvious that obtaining such consensus in favor of inflating the supply is nearly impossible at this stage. But this can’t be said for the future.

Regulatory uncertainty around applying crypto to their business model is a big jargon due to their global reach. Same with other big enterprises.
Regulations are the main reason why top companies haven’t already facilitated the acceptance, usage, and access to digital currencies yet.
Which is unfortunate to say because those that suffer the most are the people. Yes the government protects them from being scammed, but at the cost of access to opportunities which not only yield wealth creation over the longterm, but also limits the ability for companies to greatly benefit their customers with innovative technologies.
@_date: 2019-02-07 21:52:01
Bitcoin in itself is unstoppable due to its decentralized nature. But the usage perspective shouldn’t be so complicated. Holders should be able to freely transact with one another. After all, the technology allows that in a pretty unique manner. Also, most people are coming from a OTC market (e.g., localbitcoins), so it is not their problem who signs up and who doesn’t. And if you manage to make profit from doing so, you shouldn’t need to undergo such complicated, costly and time consuming registration process as is the case when registering for a MSB
@_date: 2019-02-11 09:34:59
This is a result of financially illiterate people getting into the action after watching mainstream media. Failing to get away from its hype. When investing, the last thing you want to do is to become emotionally attached to the investment.

Depends on what you pair them with. But in general, no.
@_date: 2019-02-05 16:36:16
My take:
The thing is that in a future economy it might not matter as we could potentially be detached from the spending of money as we know it; and lean completely on an IoT economy. In that case, preserving BTCs supply at the max of 21m could be a good thing, specially for storing value in a decentralized, verifiable, and digital way. Separate from any type of asset we know today. After all, in an IoT economy machines are calculating in an automated fashion.
Also, in such economy there would be other instruments for transacting on a daily basis — perhaps alternative coins/tokens better suited for the task. We must keep in mind that if crypto gets its way, the future of finance will be comprised of thousands, millions, or even billions of micro-economies run by machines and pegged to specialized services, commodities, and BTC [if the supply remains fixed].
Now, in order to implement an inflation system to Bitcoin’s protocol there would need to be overwhelming consensus among devs and hodlers in favor of such — where the majority would decide on the optimal decision, benefiting the entire industry regardless of the outcome.  
My personal opinion is that controlled inflation is good to incentive spending while reducing volatility, but if Nakamoto had implemented inflation [from the beginning] it could have compromised the bootstrapping and the entire crypto-movement could’ve been delayed years, decades, or even centuries.
What are your thoughts? Are you for or against Bitcoin inflation? And why?

Thing is, they’re putting their face on it backed by their marketing dollars. And for a company holding over a Trillion in clients assets, that’s a decision which carries immense responsibility. Doubt they would do this if they didn’t believe Bitcoin to be the future (or part of it). Remember TD Ameritrade is in an industry where reputation and trust are at the upmost importance for their success!
@_date: 2019-01-30 22:33:46
In my opinion, regulations were inevitable. Unfortunate for many who are anti-gov. However, regulations don’t necessarily mean that people will not have control over their money. E.g., BTC is like gold as no central entity controls it and it’s limited in supply (at least until there is worldwide consensus on increasing the supply which is unlikely).
Now, when you think about digital currencies as a whole, these now make possible, and will continue to, the ability to transact in a pure p2p fashion over the internet. I.e., cash for the digital age. Something we didn’t have and that is a real need for the people; specially considering that we are now interconnected globally.
You and I (and almost everyone in this planet) agree that there is absolutely no need of relying on an intermediary to complete a cash transaction. It creates delays, increases transaction costs, and overcomplicates the entire process. And code is king. The government will have a pretty hard time regulating coins such as BTC. Basically impossible unless the following happens: 
1. Gov’ts purchase the majority of BTC in circulation and the mining power. 
— Flaw is that it requires becoming fully invested in it and once people find out, other coins will emerge to counteract this behavior.
2. Gov’ts make digital currencies illegal. 
— Something that is unlikely because it won’t stop people from buying BTC for example. If anything, can increase people’s interest in it.
I believe governments such as the US have more to gain by creating regulatory frameworks that favor digital currencies without going 100% against their core functionality which is to give people full control of their money digitally.

You do make a valid point. There were too many approaching the blockchain space with the wrong intentions. But, nonetheless, Bitcoin and many other digital currencies which offer valid use cases, have tremendous future. You have plenty of countries working on implementations to replace national currencies, commodities and so forth.
Hope I’m wrong but you shouldn’t assume everyone who is optimistic about tokenizing assets and who preaches BTC to be ignorant. What happened in 2017 and then 2018 was necessary. 
People have now learned their lesson. And overall, the space is evolving thanks to the tremendous man power that is now working on adapting the technology to our daily lives.

Problem is that governments are applying legislature drafted almost a century ago to regulate the space. Projects can’t even airdrop their tokens for free. It’s considered a security offering by the SEC. Thus, requiring registering.
Speaking as the head of a project getting prepared to launch an STO under Reg D and Reg A+, the costs are astronomical and force us to exclude regular investors. In turn, the only ones that will truly benefit (as far as profits go) will be accredited investors and closed friends.
Further, the space now behaves similarly to the IPO market. As we all know, is not that easy to invest in those offerings.
