Tether only has value as long as someone is willing to buy it. No one wants to hold tether because it has zero advantages over USD, it's just used as a temporary currency between fiat and crypto.
The only reason it has stable value is the claim that there is always $1 in fiat waiting for every USDT and you can trade them back whenever you want.
The problem is, there is no proof that the exchanges actually have those fiat reserves they claim to have.

It's not a drive(in the sense you are used to) and it's not supposed to open. It also contains no Bitcoin. It's a key to your wallet that lives in internet. Those words in that paper will let anyone access your money, keep it safe, they are more important than the stick itself, you can always get a new one and use those words to get your coins.

In my experience the correct move is to shut down your computer and go to sleep. Everything goes back to normal soon. Panic trading just leads into losses.

My guess would be that usually when people start panic selling alts, they have to exchange them to btc first. This causes btc to go up, and ends the panic mode(they notice btc going up and hodl their newly acquired btc). Same goes for other way around, when people start hoarding alts, they buy them with btc which causes btc price to go temporarily down while alts go up.
This time was different, the CMC fuckup made it look like everything is crashing and people started turning crypto into fiat.

I bought at around 2k, 5k, 7k, 11k. All were ATH's and everyone was shouting NEVER BUY AT ATH IDIOT! No regrets.

Sure, but the question was about stability, not value. In you example, nickel efficiently stops beings currency and becomes a store of value that is measured in other currencies, just like gold. However, gold has special property that helps it stabilize; It has real world use in jewelry industry. While cryptos might have some similar use in the future(cryptokitties being an proof of concept example) we are probably still far from that.

Did you follow EVERY STEP of this tutorial?
 
Notice the two different firmware updates for Nano.
@_date: 2017-12-24 08:12:41
I'm really happy to hear that, awesome holidays to you too! :)

When did you sell? It can easily take 4 banking days, on some exchanges even few weeks.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:08:24
I have always bought at ATH.. this year around $2000, $5000, $7000, $9000 and
$11000. No regrets so far.
@_date: 2017-12-02 11:06:06
Well, that is actually not a bad advice.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:15:05
I kept a kind of presentation for my sister over facebook when bitcoin was around $200.. she bought 53btc :)

It will stabilize when people stop hodling and start using it. The value means nothing until you know exactly how much milk and bananas you get with it without converting to fiat first.

Theres no bitcoins nor bch in there and never has been. This may be your problem. You are trying to split coins from wrong wallet. Double check the wallet address you used when you transferred your coins. Ledger may give you more than one.
@_date: 2017-12-23 22:06:07
If you feel comfortable sharing your public wallet address, i can check if i can see something strange. Other than that, really hard to say what's wrong without actual access to your private keys(which you should not share with anyone).
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:33:42
Exactly. I'm holding currently too, but am also prepared to use it to buy other things than just more money, when it becomes a realistic option. I have big respect for the early adopters who already buy pizza and beer with it, they are doing a big favor for the currency. Wish i had guts to join them.

Actually you don't separate hard disk, you just need to take an image. For example:

I agree, this still looks like normal fluctuation. I think it briefly went to 38xx though, so bigger drop may still be coming.
@_date: 2017-08-16 06:10:21
The correction is still going on. And I'm happy, cause I want more.
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:49:02
The point is: stop caring about those dips. You will win more in the long run with regular buys than timing, usually even if you time right.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:54:56
My guess would be that the media attention of 10k brings in short term investors looking for 20-30% ROI. That means they will sell at around 12500, which may result in a small correction. Don't panic when it happens.
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:17:33
I sure hope you bought and did not wait for november.
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:44:41
So, the next dip was from 11k to 9k, i was not much off.
@_date: 2017-11-20 01:38:44
Sure. And i bought some at 7100 ATH, and would have profited if i waited for the dip. Then again my previous buy was around 5100 ATH, and it never dropped under that again.
Buy the dips but don't try to beat the market with timing unless your name happens to be Emmett Brown.
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:32:28
Which of the ATH's so far did not result in profit?
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:37:20
No there is not. The dips always come, but they do not crash under all ATH's. The next dip could be from 12K to 9K for example.

THIS. Are all the people here completely out of money and job? While still investing in bitcoin? Everyone seems to think OPs $30.000 would somehow automatically bankrupt him.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:29:34
Why does everyone automatically think people cannot afford the money they loan? The point of the loan is to get the money you save in advance so you dont have to wait. Whatever happens to bitcoin, OP still pays back the loan slowly from his salary, just as the bank intended.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:46:51
Because everyone here is 17 and never seen any money in their bank accounts or taken any loans.
@_date: 2017-09-01 04:34:56
Aren't you people overreacting? It's $30000, not $30000000. If you can get that kind of loan, you probably wont lose your shirt because of it. I just took a loan almost the same size just to buy some stuff to my yard. Still have my shirt on.
