no you could just follow it from one address to the other.
try it out on blockchain.info. Click on an address in the scrolling transactions, follow the money.

just get $20 or whatever minimum amount is when coinbase account gets working.  Play with that for a while.

I bought an android device just for screwing around.  Enjoy getting to try out all the wallets.  Don't find it nearly as refined as ios, kind of annoying.
Still can't buy another ios device with apple's badditude towards bitcoin, and other apps that I have wanted in the past.
No viable options.

very true, you can never trust anything the police say.  
It sounds like they are just trying to trap the OP.  Trying to trick him into giving up some money.

so the argument here is one side saying inflation is an increase of demand for goods with a steady supply of those goods, the other definition is an increase in the supply of money with a steady demand for money?
this is so much easier to wrap your head around on a smaller scale.  Like the supply and demand for bitcoins, or the way the stone money of yap became worth less when metal tools were introduced.  Or even gold when more miners get into it and drive up the supply, bringing down the cost.

It would be an ironic kick in the nuts to the bitcoin community

That argument is done to death.  I don't see millions being invested into altcoins by vc's.  I don't see tons of new altcoin infrastructure around.
Not too much alt coin adoption going on.  How long do we have to wait for the one true altcoin?

this isn't like global warming.  It is more like worrying about what kind of a car you want to buy in 100 years.
We have no idea what cars will be available in 100 years, will we still drive cars?  For the foreseeable future we will be driving cars, but in 100 years?
Or maybe it is more like worrying about how you are going to afford gas for your car in 100 years.  
@_date: 2013-12-24 23:00:30
but why even bother stocking products in the stores?  Why not just have it like the old dvd places where they only had the cases.  So you scan the qr code, add it to the list, it goes in your cart that the guys in the warehouse are filling for you, one invoice from bitpay at the end.
Bit of a slippery slope at that point though, why even bother going to the store in the first place?

All this talk of gyft is disappointing to non americans.  It is weird, we have all the same retailers in canada (well, not all, but most).
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:14:57
what coin is this and where can I buy it?
@_date: 2013-12-25 17:24:36
Alt coins are typically just a distraction that aren't going to lead anywhere.  It is fine to have them but hyping them up when they don't really offer anything new is just setting people up for a fall.
Some alt coins might lead somewhere but for the most part it is just taking advantage of newbs who think that $666 for a bitcoin is too much (missed the boat fallacy) so maybe the next big thing will be X and buy into that.  Lack of liquidity means it doesn't take too many people buying in to drive the price up, giving positive feedback to the newbs who buy more, then the non newbs dump.
In the end altcoins are kind of like inflation for bitcoins.  Creating more units of digital currency.  People shooting themselves in the foot.

is there any way to see today's biggest bdd transactions?
@_date: 2013-12-23 19:08:15
Most people invest in the altcoins because they feel they missed the boat on bitcoins and are hoping to get lucky. Which is a complete misunderstanding of the economics of it.  They are just slowing down the boat for everyone.  But it doesn't matter anyway, people with money will understand that and won't bother with the altcoins.
Bitcoin boats will keep coiming.
Having said that altcoins are still fine they have a useful feature of beta testing, and by all means if the next satoshi makes a breakthrough that makes bitcoins obsolete, so be it.  I don't see it anytime soon.

OMG I have been reading about rai stones for the last few days and at one point I skimmed over a comment from somebody on how money was time as we use it to avoid doing labour.
Blah blah blah it took a lot of labour to make these stones and take it back to their island, so it was worth it for somebody to buy one instead of trying to make one themselves.
I lost the comment on the time and exchange for labour.  Anybody know a link to what I was looking at before?

I can't believe somebody can hold up a qr code at a sports event and make thousands, but somebody puts a bunch of time and effort into informative videos and only gets like $27.

please explain how this worked in 1920s Germany and more recently in Zimbabwe.
I don't think either scenario fits into your three common reasons, but rather under the "print money" reason.

You are assuming that people are rational beings when it comes to deflation, which is a debatable topic.
Stable or somewhat stable economies?  The US?  You are describing the US as stable when all anybody can talk about is the "great recession"?   Stable after fighting two wars and getting no plunder in return?  One would almost say that the US is the one paying reparations, meaning the US lost those wars.
If my household budget looked in any way as red as the US budget, would anyone say my finances were stable?
