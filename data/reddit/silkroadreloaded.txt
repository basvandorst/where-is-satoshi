They are willing and do the writing analysis.  
I have never in my entire existence used any social media, writing or anything online, etc.  Nothing.
Let us all face it I am nothing to them anyway.  They have all they could ever ask for with what they have running right now.  There has been a campaign against any alternative whether I am the character or someone else.  I simply recognized a problem and tried to provide a solution, unlike predecessors you all know I have no interest in weapons or stolen data so my concerns were in the area of safety.
I am wittingly comfortable with the idea that I2P will not be used because it will not be anything I have done which gets them to recognize Tor is not what they thought.

The charges have been dropped regarding the hitmen, especially the considering the whole fiasco was made up in the first place.  That in itself should bring serious doubt.  In fact the govt continuously uses violence as an excuse to go after someone, ironically when a person goes after the govt for exactly the same thing; they are excused.  This is not only unequal but, a complete perversion of any form of law.

There is no logic in bootlicking.  I've revived the name on I2P and I'm being attacked simply because of the name, not a single one of those attacking has made a single mention about site functionality or anything along those lines.
The reality is that the state actors have no logic other than what their boss demands of them.  The govt has given themselves permission to wage cyberwar propaganda against us and this isn't going to let up anytime soon.
SilkRoad was about economic and financial freedom, the core of Bitcoin principles also follow this, anything with the idea or action of actual freedom behind it is a threat to the type of govt that wants to control you as a plantation master controls a slave.
The ultimate realization is that we don't need them in our lives, considering they have the title of "public servant" it's time to enforce that definition as it actually is.

Totally dropped.  They're original intentions were to get him in court no matter what, the only thing that would really stick it seems is the accusations of violence.  The prosecutor's attempts to silence Ross's views on specific things such as potentially convincing the jury about nullification are what confirms the shadyness of the whole thing for many.  
Everyone is thinking that the outcome of this is going to be a "game changer", the sad reality is that the "game changer" has already happened or Ross wouldn't be in the predicament he's in in the first place.

Way to many to back up my claims.
What you should be asking is why they have not spent (or publicly claimed) funding on getting in to I2P but, instead have spent massive amounts of money keeping it buried and out of the media.
Further ask why is the mainstream media so quick to point it out and even how to use it.  They do not do that with I2P, and guess what it is just as easy to install.

That would be the thought because that act of violence has the same end result regardless of the motive right?  So the government decides who's "murder" is better?  If so why?  Are they better than americans even though they are supposed to serve americans?  Was there not something that happened in 1776 because of this exact type of selective "justice"?

Bitcoin community not only have you kept my faith that many are highly aware of what is going but, you prove it.
These attempts at "licensing" should not go unchallenged, *ever* because the last freedom we seem to have when it comes to full choice has been opened thanks to Bitcoin: Economic Freedom.  The establishment knows once they have squeezed that last piece it is over for everyone.
Bitcoin enables free-thinkers such as myself the ability to create anything I would like and believe me.  It is unbelievable how much they put you through to get payment processing online *on your own*, they always try to funnel you into something where someone makes off your work.  If they don't like your work they shut it down, ask ANY paypal business user that has been in that situation.  Examples are endless.

Many of you may not be aware but, there is an active campaign I have personally experienced to stop any mention of anything other than Tor. Specifically when it comes to alternatives on where the audience is fairly new to the technology and easily manipulated.
For example I had not even completed the site, not asked anyone to come to anything but, advised they learn I2P which when I did was like letting blood in a shark tank.
If that were the behavior of business competitors it is not hard to imagine it being different however it fits the MO of agencies with an agenda, which I to believe they are heavily wrapped up into Tor with.  Changing course now (the users catching on and jumping ship) would literally sink millions in forfeiture and fundings they would get from the arrests.  It's about the money but, not how everyone thinks.  Just my two BTCs.
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:18:11
There are, and have been around a lot longer.  In fact many of the ones existing before also have similar very distressing tales of going through the "regulation" hoops.
Looks like they're trying to pull the "who you know in the good ole boy club" nonsense to attempt to take the absolute last vestige of Economic Freedom.
They thought they would have everyone using plantation dollars by now, that is the predominant reasoning Bitcoin is called "disruptive technology" because it "disrupts" their plans.

*Stay away from anything google, microsoft or any of that nonsense.  
*Make something that communicates over the I2P network do your updates, transactions, everything; you will have literally no one able to monitor, ditch Tor it's over.
*Offer the option to use a PGP/GPG key for all security, ensure this is changeable in the future.
*Make it have it's own bootable OS, check out TinyCore linux for something small if you need a suggestion.  Make sure software is upgradeable (read/write fs?) also since I2P is fairly quick to fix issues they find.
You could possibly create an early prototype using Beagle Black it's quick (1ghz) and has plenty of options, cheap to around $60 I think.  Arduino is to slow when you want to engineer a good response during encryption calls.  
Refine the idea(s) make it your own, if you need funding make a prototype and message me I would donate if you are on the right track.

There is a little known enhancement that has been done to Bitcoin to allow it to run on I2P.  Over on in the sidebar is the info needed to get on to the I2P network.  It is easier now than Tor.  There is a pre 0.9 series Bitcoin client which will run natively over I2P.  
It is available here:  
It is an older version however it is the version before the "bitcoin foundation" got "involved", it works absolutely fine.
If you really want to get heavy or you are a SysAdmin, you can create/use Bitcoin Stealth addresses: 
If you need help compiling this version of Bitcoin over I2P let me know.  If there is enough demand I can create Linux and Windows binaries and link the download also in the sidebar.
Any questions?  Do not hesitate to ask, we are all in this together and helping each other is an effective way of fighting back immediately.

This block size debate is simply the result of psychological war game analysis conducted with the intent to find what people have an issue with and then poke it with a stick until it starts bleeding.
This angle was easily exercised (to the ignorant masses who have little to no technical understanding) due to the misperception that downloading the blockchain is a "bad thing" because it "uses so much space".  This is loaded with emotional charges that have nothing to do with functionality, operation or efficiency.

Because the majority of people are children in adult bodies with minds barely developed past a 16 year old so it makes perfect sense to them to always have parents (authority) around.  
The only way this "will work" is if the masses go along with it, and "the masses" are mostly brain dead morons who barely have the brain function to force their lungs to expand/collapse.
These "masses" also wouldn't survive without the govt so it's only natural they continue the sucking (use your imagination).

Considering one of the two devs is already known to have had multiple visits with/from/by the "cia/nsa" it's not hard to realize that there are forces at work which don't (and never will) have the Bitcoin users' interests as priority.
The sad thing is that these tactics being used as Satoshi's message described, are also the same tactics being used against I2P and other technologies which are not within control of these forces.  Disappointingly the masses being indoctrinated into the world of technology are quickly becoming "smarter butlers" of the elites' toys and operations.
This behavior has been identified already and has been shown to be effective in manipulating the masses that are unaware.  For a reminder of what I've been posting for the last year in regards to this (because those of us using/building/creating leading edge tech are a direct threat to TPTB, I have lost count of the death threats):
Ever wonder why gavin didn't tell anyone about those meetings he had with those govt people?  
Do you ever wonder how someone like gavin can all of a sudden have a mission that wasn't delegated or suggested by Satoshi?
Notice how this block size "problem" came out of nowhere?  Notice how they wait for a "reaction" from the masses (unaware, uninformed Bitcoin users just jumping on the bandwagon)?  Then notice how they have a "solution" to this magically created "problem"?
See the problem with a corrupt, ignorant govt is that it keeps trying the same tactics over and over and expecting them to work (they need the masses to be ignorant otherwise these lame strategies get easily identified).  Granted they do work on the sleeping masses but, those of us that are aware should be able to easily outnumber two measely developers who've been compromised (most likely have had their lives threatened).  Let's just dump them out of the picture and move on, they're idiots and we all know this so get them out of the picture before they actually do some damage and let us all laugh about it later before you realize what the purpose of increasing the block size is......
Two developers (aka spies) shouldn't be that difficult to handle unless you're all scared of them for some reason.  This shouldn't even be a debate anymore, kick those ousted spies to the curb and let's move on already.
How about this for a real change with Bitcoin, get rid of the cia/nsa/dea/ss element and anything funny or stupid like this comes along again tell them to go to Hell.

You have a free account on SilkRoadReloaded if you'd like..  This is one of those highly requested items by the customers (not everything they want is drug/questionable related).
Damn good to hear though :)

Why not just openly admit to the public that you're trying to match up bank accounts with blockchain transactions of similar amounts at similar times?
Oh wait did I say that out loud?

The irony here is delusional that the US govt would even consider admitting fault, completely reversing and then correcting.  Look at how many unarmed citizens are killed/beaten by police after all that protesting/voting if you have any doubts.
We all sound like we are complaining about the british and it is the colonies all over again.  People it is time to grow up and face the music, they are all corrupt and need to be dumped in the Boston harbor right next to those rotting boxes of tea at the bottom.

If you want to send Bitcoin anonymously and don't believe in using the silly time wasting and TX fee wasting tumblers.  You can easily use SilkRoad Reloaded as a proxy to send any amount for only the TX fee of 0.0001 from your wallet (there are no fees for withdraws or deposits like other darknet markets).  
You can also convert most altcoins instantly in to Bitcoin and then send it right out to Snowden's fund.

You could say that...
Using i2p is in the simplest way I can put it; like using a private LAN with its own protocols.  I hear these days Vuze is the preferred torrent client with i2p.  For more info check out it will get you all the right info for what you may want to do.

Kim Dotcom found out they can take it even if you have no "constitutional rights" e.g. not an american citizen.  So really it's hard to tell which rules the dictators want to demand the sheeple to follow.
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:05:34
Interesting you bring that to light because now the torrents have a new home on i2p.
Back to subject at hand though, yes that is correct.  Revolution comes to mind very quickly for an unconventional method to which history has shown great success when motivated properly.  The amount of motivation the american populace have is like a buffet of injustices to choose from for redress of grievances.

In my best opinion it is not so much an "attack" you need worry about, as is "tracking" because all Tor operations must operate on the principle of TCP/IP.
Actually there is a bitcoinQT and bitcoind I2P implementation.  Works just fine.  You can get it here =&gt;   EDIT: Found this guide if you want to build it or just get a quick understanding of it =&gt; 
If you are a fan of Electrum I am in the process of completing an Electrum server on I2P also.  Which will allow you to use your Electrum Client on I2P as well.  This is literally about to go live, just tuning and testing a few more things to make sure it is solid.
Sub us over at as these things are announced there usually first.

This type of corruption runs very deep.  Think training day movie.  
In fact it makes you wonder if Evo exit scamming has anything to do with this as well. If you calculate the date of when it went down via exit scamming, Mar 18th, 2015 (the 18th right if I am not mistaken, I am calculating 15 days back from today), that is also the date one of the corrupt agents resigned.
The behavior I have experienced in addition to the many accounts with the same writing styles leads me to believe we are looking at a bigger corrupt operation possibly without realizing it.  Think in this context a modern version of the "iran-contra" affair.
I have received many threats of similar nature that did.  The mods at the subreddit here are very active in promoting specific markets, Evolution was one that they heavily promoted.  Now if you go over there you will barely see a peep about Evolution, considering this happened only about 15 days ago it clearly demonstrates that an organization with resources, motives, etc is behind this heavy marketing or "herding" of drug customers.  Then when you dig further you will notice that ever since Evolution came online there have been major drug dealers all getting busted who are online dealers only, a pattern that repeats itself every 30 days.  Now notice that since Evolution has been down this pattern is not showing itself.
There are many more facets to this situation, do not be surprised how deep this goes, I have already stated things like this were going to happen.  I was not believed but, now I am being completely ignored because the attack campaign failed and now they're trying to make sure no one even has SilkRoad Reloaded on their mind because that will interrupt the real source of income for these corrupt govt agencies.

Things are going very well.  I do not know why Vice did the article although it is possible they did it because I was getting attacked so vehemently and it the attacking caused the subreddit to start trending.
I am very much ancap and everything I do, everything I say is centered completely in that (everything is here for all to see).
Trusting your fellow ancapper isn't bad, regardless of the chosen occupation, unlike all of my predecessors I put the community first and my own financial gains last.  In fact the I2P devs are already aware of my donations again unlike the Tor operators I know we're all in this together and greedy guts behavior is out of line.
@_date: 2015-03-21 14:57:41
You do take criminals' words over anyone's every single day, it's called the 'us govt'.  You and many others like you did nothing and still continue to do nothing when they do "criminal behavior" then claim we're criminals for the same thing.
Give me break.
@_date: 2015-03-30 20:32:26
What do you expect.  This case was rife with problems from the beginning.  The biggest issue being it's a victimless crime.  So it makes sense the real criminals get exposed.  We all know they will probably if at all get a slap on the wrist.  The corruption stinks so bad it's a wonder they can still put on a white shirt that doesn't turn brown in a second.
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:59:14
I experience the same indiscretions regarding evo vs SilkRoadReloaded...  They jump all over because of the name I chose over a year ago, then at the same time evo is modifying feedback, allowing vendors to scam, etc. then this.  Yet they *still* do exactly the same thing in this comparison.
It really gets your mind turning in regards to who is behind these "campaigns" of smearing despite evidence of worse behavior.
@_date: 2015-03-21 09:03:48
What's funnier than anything about this to me is that they claimed I was going to scam and that everyone should use evo instead of SilkRoadReloaded.i2p
Not a single one of them has said a peep now.  I even warned them that something was going to happen because of the feedback getting modified.
I have been laughing for 3 days straight I kid you not.

It went through Anoncoin so at the moment no.  Like I said it wasn't much in the first place maybe about $5.00 USD (at the moment).  Absolutely nothing to brag about but, my intentions are in place and as things progress I can do more (obviously can't give what I don't have).
@_date: 2015-03-21 17:53:34
I wouldn't say it publicly without it being the case, now and continuing in to the future.  I haven't been able to give as much as I would like (yet because I don't have it) but, they are auto-donated to out of the profits at a very hefty percentage.  I am not greedy and as long as I have shelter, food and water I am in utopia.
It is stupid that the Tor operators don't share because without Tor they could/would not exist.  Then at the same time they have the nerve to complain about the Tor people accepting govt funding.
That kind of mentality, behavior and activity should tell many of you critical thinkers what kind of people are running the Tor markets.
Believe it or not I operate with the utmost integrity and do the absolute best I can to serve the community.  I already have a years worth of evidence right here to prove that and continue to do so.

There are way to many incidents like this happening in camp cryptsy for this to be a coincidence.  You will not get justice unless you act in a language they understand; theft.  What do I mean?  Hack them, yes you read that, it is the only way.  Hack them for exactly what they owe, nothing more, nothing less.  
That is the only way they will learn because thieves do not follow any sort of moral compass; there's never points North and is always spinning.
I am beyond fed up with crooks and you all know what I did in response.
PS: I do not use cryptsy and anyone that asks me about them I warn them that they will risk losing ***everything***.

The idiots have accepted the *government's monopoly on violence*, it is ok when they do it unacceptable when you do.
Why do you think they are so intent on prosecution when you defend yourself physically against anything (including agents of the state)?
Because only wolves want you to be defenseless.
The ussa govt is so corrupt, so rotten to the core, it is beyond done.  It needs a reboot in the worst way imaginable.

40,000+ new laws in the so-called "land of the free" is 100% verification and confirmation of this.  Insane how the population has allowed things to go this far when originally coming from an anti-govt mindset.  When you see the population allowing their own to be killed with impunity (the police abuse) then you know there is absolutely *nothing* the government can do wrong and not get away with.
@_date: 2015-02-05 11:12:11
**Of course they will also look back and ask why they did not rise up sooner instead of foolishly allowing this to go on for so long.**
Only in the ussa can you be told what to do with your own body and be punished for not.  That is not free anyone who believes they are in that context is insane.

Did you really have any faith/belief in the so-called "justice system" after you watch so-called "police" kill a person(s) on video and they not only protect but, let the clown walk? (Youtube has *thousands* of these videos if you need a refresher.)
**Seriously, can you honestly expect anything less?**
*Is it not obvious at this point that there is no government operating for the people by the people in the so called land of the free?*
The level of corruption in the ussa is beyond comprehension, what is even worse is why have the population allowed it, and now because they are so dumbed down it is to late to stop it.

I am not anyone and neither are they.  The reality is we all know that ultimately it will come down to violence perpetrated by the govt to enforce whatever they believe at that moment you are committing to be wrong.  In the end all we're doing is intellectualizing violence and theft by an organization we know to be wrong.  The mob/mafia mentality this govt has been racing towards for the last 10+ years is not what it was built for.  In fact if you look at history and use that as a clear guiding stone of noticing repetitive behavior you will see that the govts that did this were considered criminal and eventually overthrown.  The govt in the US is now in the position of being the next to experience what it means to push citizens to far.  Enjoy the ride everyone we're way overdue.
