@_date: 2015-06-20 23:08:58
To elaborate on the mining part. Mining is not a good idea financially unless you have acess to very cheap electricity because it costs more in electricity to mine the coins than you would make selling the coins, at their current value. If you mined them today and sold them at the top of some future bubble you could turn a profit, but it's not a good idea to bank on that. Although some people do.
And if someone did accumulate half the bitcoin and lose them, I suppose the value of the rest of them would double to pick up the slack. But probably not because of who the hands of the coins are in. Maybe the value drops because people lose faith?
But yes, people do lose coins all the time. Computers crash, people leave a few bits on an old wallet, there is even a guy who threw out a computer in 2012ish that had 1000BTC on it. But because each bitcoin is made of one millions satoshis, you can think of there being 21 quadrillion "bitcoin units". We could theoretically lose all but one bitcoin, fork the blockchain, and divide tat bitcoin into 21 million new ones. Each person who owned a fraction of that one bitcoin would still own the same fraction of the new 21 million, preserving their value. 
Sorry for spelling g on mobile
Also it takes a while to get up to speed on bitcoin, it's a bit of a wild west right now, a book called Mastering Bitcoin would be a good start .

I agree that bitcoin is awesome and will grow to be much larger than it is today, I think you're underestimating image.
 There is a reason companies spend so much money on advertising and marketing their products. I think the "blockchain" "worldwide ledger" rebrand will be good for bitcoin. And the fact bircoin is evolving to be more of a backend technology. For people to start using  it day to day, we need to make it simple and easy to use, and keys and hashing and adresses are confusing. Not that most people wouldn't get it if they took the time. But most people won't because why should they, they have other shit to worry about.

@_date: 2014-12-11 19:47:19
Well, no matter what I saw someone will disagree with me. If Bitcoin supersedes fiat currencies as the main currency for global business and commerce, your $15 in Bitcoin could be worth thousands in a few years. Just today Microsoft, the second largest company in the world, started accepting Bitcoin. Barring some complete collapse of Bitcoin, which is unlikely at this point, it will definitely be worth more than it is now. If you keep it, you have a lot to gain, and little to lose, seems like a no brainer.

It looks like people are going to start using XBT as a unit, instead of bits. I think the push to use the word "bit", was just a push to use a fraction of 1BTC as a unit of measurement to simplify things.
It just happened that "XBT" caught on faster that "bit" because "XBT" was used by the ISO.

Lamassu, but I think it's the owners fault, not the machine. I did a $20 test first, and that one had a fee, but not the $650 purchase for some reason.

@_date: 2015-01-17 15:14:45
I bought coins from a lamassu about 10 times this week, because VoS closed and I wanted to buy a few. And I had problems. More than half the transactions did not include a fee, and if it did, it was not based on purchase size. I had a fee on a $20 txn, and no fee on a $20 txn. I had no fee on a $600 txn, and no fee on a $140 txn. It's pretty freaky waiting 6 hours for a confirmation on 2.77BTC, especially when the price is moving so fast.
@_date: 2015-01-26 22:14:21
It's not too late to "cash in" but I would recommend you read the sidebar links, some videos by Andreas Antonopolous (I think that's how you spell it) and some other YouTube videos.

Because it does things better, you say you can send money anywhere quickly for only 2-3 dollars. Why not 2-3 cents? Bitcoin is an effective payment network and has a predictable supply. Yes, currency many people involved in Bitcoin are crooks, but they're getting shaken out, one at a time. Every time Bitcoin bubbles, it gets better, faster, and more reliable. The blockchain protocol, so far, is very reliable. As long as it stays that way, people will build services on the blockchain. Besides, the bank payment network is the culmination of hundreds of years of banking, and this is as good as it's gotten. Bitcoin has been around for 6 years and it's come so far, and has lots of room to grow.

@_date: 2015-01-15 03:07:34
It looks like your out of luck then. Over time, the difficulty of mining bitcoins goes up, and the reward for mining a block halves. [Difficulty and Reward over time]( In that chart, Monetary base is the total number of bitcoins, and Inflation Rate is how many bitcoins get mined per block. When Bitcoin was small, the total mining power on the network was also small. At that time, 2011-2012ish, a graphics card, with its inefficiencies, could mine a reasonable amount of bitcoins. Although probably not enough to profit at the time, I don't think those people weren't thinking about profit, bitcoin was just a cool experiment. Then the price went up to $1200, and people started using special mining computers, ASICs, to mine bitcoins. ASICs are far faster and more energy efficient than your GPU. There are many miners with warehouses of these ASIC miners, pumping out BTC 24/7, and they are turning their computers off because they aren't turning a profit. The GPU mining boat is gone, and with $300, you cant get on the ASIC boat. I would suggest spending the money on an actual Bitcoin. 
Good luck with finding out more about bitcoin

The blockchain works because miners provide the hashing power to secure the network. If they didn't get paid to hash, why would anyone run miners? 
The real technology is the blockchain, the incentive to make that technology work is Bitcoin. They are two parts of the same thing, you can't have one without the other. 
People could double spend bitcoins and 51% attack if there was little or no hashing power. And people wouldn't hash if they didn't get money for it.

That's not how AMAs work. 
Also, many redditors who see this will now have a negative impression of your company. Reddit is a great way to promote yourself, but if you break reddit rules, written and unwritten, you're going to have a bad time.

The article said he proposed the bill in response to similar bill proposed by another senator. The difference being his included spending cuts in other areas. Unfortunately one of those areas is education, still not sure how I feel about him. Not that it matters, I'm Canadian

I remember another post about a different insurance companies summary of Bitcoin, and it was just as factual and balanced. Go insurance companies?

Make sure it can't be unbolted easily, maybe weld the bolt heads so sockets can't fit over them, or use JB weld, or use thread lock as well. Just make sure it can't be removed by a socket set and a breaker bar

My mother guilted me into selling 10btc because she needed money over the last 2 years. I have 0btc now. The pain is driving me nuts. Shes taken everything good in my life. My pride, my passion, my money, my love, everything. Just needed to vent

I have been holding for the last year. For fun I put 1.5BTC on bitfinex to screw around with. Holy fuck why. I haven't lost it yet but it is fucking scary watching it drop to one dollar away from your margin call.

That happened to me, sacred the shit out of me
Did you enable a secondary password? because if you type it incorrectly your trezor generates a fake wallet with 0 BTC. If so, try recovering your trezor, select secondary password, and enter your old password.
 If what happened to me happened to you, your balance should be there

Yes, but visa has been optimized for and integrated with POS systems for how many years now? Bitpay and coinbase are infants compared to visa. But given the same amount of time, far less probably, Bitcoin will be way more efficient than traditional payment systems. Not yet unfortunately though

[A hairless bear]( Bears are terrifying and not cute. They are vicious murdering machines. When they eat something, they don't kill it by biting its neck like a big cat. They hold you down and with their paws and go to town on your midsection, like you're a salmon. Hell, Bears will kill baby bears, just so they can fuck the mama bear sooner. 
If I saw one of these coming for my Bitcoins, I would run.
