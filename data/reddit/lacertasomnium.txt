Hi, could you tell me how old does an electrum wallet have to be to be compromised? Am I fine if it's from 4 months ago? Can I simply move my btc to a new electrum wallet in any case? I was anyway thinking of moving it to my old desktop computer which I no longer use.

Right, thanks.

Thanks, I will read it then. If I may ask in advance here, how long can a low transaction fee take to get confirmed?

Okay, I am doing some research but I do have two final quick questions if i may: if it never confirms can it be unconfirmed so the btc goes back to the sender? in which case is the original bidding fee lost or is it returned as well?
Oh, and of course the computer doing the send or recieve can be turned off when the transaction is unconfirmed? I've only ever turned it off when it is incomplete but already confirmed.

I once owned a bitcoin bought at like 700 dollars that I really shouldn't have spent on drugs. My current bitcoin was bought at like 5k but I can still understand the bad spirits (even though I made some money selling some around 10k I don't know if I should sell all and maybe reinvest if it starts going upwards in the future)

Ok, thought as much but it's always better to ask. Thanks!

Is this only electrum pro, or is this also the normal electrum wallet? I've had the common electrum one since mid-2017, is that also compromised?

Sólo decimos bitcoin. Teoricamente sería bitmoneda
