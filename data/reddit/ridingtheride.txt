you have been watching bitcoin since it was like 15 dollars and have never invested in it, but did so just NOW in this extreme bubble phase? jesus... did you never invest like 20 hours straight with lots of info to "fully" understand the concept and then deciding for yourself if it will work or not? 
Also, why invest now?! Now of all times where the hype was surreal and a big correction - OBVIOUSLY - is right ahead of us?

**now the comfortable truths:**
1. Bitcoin actually HAS inherent value, unlike FIAT money. FIAT money is issued depending on what the central banks think is needed to stabilize our wholey monetary system. It is not limited. And there is no inherent value to be found in cash. It is simply the trust and consensus in our society that we decide that on.
However, Bitcoin is not just limited in supply, it is also expensive to "produce" What are the costs for mining 1 bitcoin? like 2000 dollars? That could be seen as inherent value. 
2. Bitcoin is used by criminals? Jesus christ. There are legit statistics from governments(!) tell us that like 4% of illicit activities are paid in cryptocurrencies. Guess what is the rest: Cash, predominantly.
Nothing is as anonym and intransparent as cash.
Now, from the 4% I would imagine only a small portion is actually Bitcoin and the rest is private shit like Monero and ZCash. Bitcoin is amazing for the authorities. It's transparent.

Still calling it Bitcoin Core XDDD
damn I just don't understand Roger Ver. He clearly has to turn around 180 degrees to ever be taken seriously again.

will never understand why one would want to use this one.  
@_date: 2018-05-05 07:31:44
Thx for this reply. True that. But wouldn‘t you say that this aspect, paired with the fact that it is expensive to introduce newly mined bitcoins and the limited protocol can be seen as inherent value? I mean the limitation is something that also makes people trust the system.

someone needs to tell this puppets if they know they are literally protesting against human evolvement. This tech is simply another big step forward in human kind. So funny how there have been ppl since ever protesting against something that is absolutely common sense. ...
I am kidding guys :-) But that‘s exactly what will happen like 2 years...can‘t wait. 
@_date: 2018-05-20 19:00:16
You are right, of course. Sorry for my „tone“. Yeah, sort of useless until they implement it.

who need Bloomberg terminals? you make way more just HODLing through anything and take small profits here and there during extreme reallys. That's how you lower your risk every single time, yet do not harm the market. 
Paying 20k per year from terminal access....fools. What kidn of info would have been worth 10k so far since we are already half into 2018 already? None.

Then you need to include a tutorial on how to make a new wallet �� 
@_date: 2018-10-08 06:35:06
Then let's change that. Stop upvoting such meaningless content.
Concentrate on the good news and not just post and upvote it, but actually learn it. First thing that comes to mind are such things as reading Julian Hosp's new book "Blockchain 2.0", just as an example. 
Plenty of good things happening in the space, including even the stupid market/price: Now that 6,5k seems to really be the new bottom basis is quite decent as well. If we think about it how it was at roughly 2,5k last year before the mania set in. 
Quite an improvement on all ends. Literally the only frustrating thing is how just soooo many people around us would still show no interest in crypto at all at this point.

when are we finally going to habe regulation? otherwise we wont‘ be able to move forward.
This is like the 100 postponing of introducing some regulation - the price dropped each time a little more than it has risen after the announcement of not introducing regulation. 
@_date: 2019-02-06 21:17:04
sure thing, thx. 
it‘s wrong anyway. hundreds of people reading it will once again feel confirmed in their superficial knowledge. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 17:54:20
hope you bought it with freshly bought bitcoins instead of spending the ones you bought at a higher rate. 
@_date: 2018-11-10 13:03:35
absolutely. At least in Germany, Austria and Switzerland - but probably most European countries - it is very rare to have ice (optional at McDonalds etc) in your drink. And we probably never will. We hate the ice cubes...it‘s diluting the soda so much(!) and takes up an awful lot of space in your cup. And then there‘s the health aspect...it‘s astonishing what shitty water in a lot of countries is used for ice cubes.
WHY would you put ice in your drinks?! Who wouldn‘t rather go ahead and put sodas in the fridge 40min before consumptions.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:21:50
Please be aware of how you use the word "scam". Bitcoin itself has been working as intended for almost 10 years now. 
It - by definition - can not be a scam.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:39:54
Yeah I see. Well, to a certain degree, it depends on the amount then. I mean who would break into your house for 0.1 BTC.
Definitely not a thing here in Austria. Thanks for the answer!

nothing wrong with proper sugar in water. (in moderate doses) 
Unlike in the US many ppl here drink cola etc only on weekends or every two weeks.
Utter nonsense how ppl nowadays would consider carbs and sugar as unhealthy...like 2 of 3 basic energy sources for our body��‍♂️
@_date: 2018-11-13 08:52:59
They would never react like that. Definitely scammy. And in the rare case it was legit, that Coinbase employee should be schooled. 
@_date: 2018-03-28 15:53:48
ah that's just way too far fetched to be funny. but I guess a solid 2 months into the bear market we appreciate some fun. :-)
@_date: 2018-11-23 12:46:30
just focus on your left screen and you will be alright.

Would love to know about your total amount of electricity costs and the specs of your gaming PC.
@_date: 2018-02-06 17:24:00
you do realise a lot of extremely good developers are working on the issue? Bitcoin will eventually not just have the Lighnting Network, but moving away from Proof of Work as well.
@_date: 2018-03-11 10:22:36
why wouldn't you?
@_date: 2018-04-24 15:44:05
this whole site is NOT OK. it‘s owned by Roger Ver even though it says bitcoin.com...yeah...I was in shock when I found that out quite some months ago.
Haven‘t ever used it since. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 06:27:16
Right. Well, BTC is highly limited and very expensive to „produce“. 2 factors alone that show more intrinsic value than our paper that has none on a fundamental level. 100 years ago we decided to trust central banks because we had to in order to make the system somewhat efficient.
