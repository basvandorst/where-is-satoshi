So please help me understand. They gave you 20btc @ $800 or something and now they want them back. Here is the reality. The money was deposited into your account in US DOLLARS. The withdrawal that they initiated was the SAME EXACT AMOUNT. Where is the problem. The only difference is now when they came to get the money out of the account they deposited to you had already moved it... Explain to me why I am wrong?
And even if I am wrong and they deposited 20btc to your wallet. They would first withdraw 20btc before charging you. IT HAPPENED TO ME

Not a troll. Simply stating it happened to me. I personally withdrew the money and was like FUCK YOU. But ended up making right on the whole deal. The truth is the same thing happened to the original poster. The only difference is he feels the money shouldn't be given back.

So where are the 20btc they deposited to your Coinbase Wallet?

ANSWER THIS SIMPLE QUESTION
Where are the original 20btc the were given to you by mistake. If you "did not" withdraw/spend them where did they go?

Your not being honest here.... They mistakingly deposited 20btc worth of money to your checking account. It happened to me as well. The only difference is that you withdrew the money and felt you could keep it.... Let's just be honest here... And if the simply "put" an extra 20 BTC into your account it should still be there in addition to the 20 you tried to sell that didn't go through. "On this date, my order to SELL 20 BTC for some reason failed."

It's the only time I'm posting cause it happened to me as well. The difference was after withdrawing the BTC and getting hit with a ACH for the amount I transfer the coin back to Coinbase to correct it. Like the original poster I thought I could keep the coin but realized it wasn't gonna happen and returned them. That's it.

EXACTLY! You moved the extra coins from Coinbase thinking you could get away with it. When they went to withdraw them from your account there were none there. Then they charged you for what you STOLE. Whats the problem?
