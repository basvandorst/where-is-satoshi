Break US laws and you are a US criminal, it’s pretty standard stuff. He’s a criminal. This isn’t our country, it’s the governments.

Dismissing it as irrelevant is preposterous, but to think that blockchain has no value independent of bitcoin is preposterous. 
Also, bitcoin as a value-transfer system is also preposterous. You should always HODL because bitcoin is being viewed by the international investing community as digital gold and not as some new form of currency

I’m not anti-bitcoin. Defend your statements. Why is it preposterous to see value in blockchain but not bitcoin

Wouldn’t you want the price to be stable? It is a currency I thought?

Why? Wells Fargo, JPMorganChase, Bank of America, why do the big banks have to embrace bitcoin? Why should Visa, PayPal, MasterCard or any other payment processing company embrace bitcoin? All of these companies will be utilizing blockchain tech in the coming years, but probably not bitcoin or any other coin that exists on coinmarketcap

LMAO let’s just use little gold coins with the bitcoin logo as marketing/advertising everywhere. That’s not misleading at all.

Either pumps are good or bad they can’t be both
