when you say big banks I'm sure your talking about the central banks...ie a corporate collective of big banks that own THE big banks, the ones that print currency out of thin air and then run a usury scam on the citizens of the respective country that THE big bank is creating it for. In the case of the usa its the fed and their sister corp the ecb has all of Europe covered....So lets get some things straight, last time I checked all CC including bitcoin value there value on CENTRAL BANK currency. So the long and short of it is this; if anyone is going to print money out thin air and make shitloads of free money for doing nothing it us the central bank.

most people think that a bank is required to report your statements to the government, so they can collect the right amount of tax, when in fact the bank owns the government, and tells the government to collect the tax money so they can give it back to the bank as their profit...banks who happen to collectively own the central bank that creates the money....scamola systems brought to you by...you know who.

why can't crypto currency do the same thing? I disagree, the only reason all that you have stated has happened was because the "civilized" economy is in essence a credit card system of currency creation. The psychological ramifications of THINKING you are rich can not be discounted, "be a winner by feeling like a winner" however if we look at the exponential dynamics all we really see is a society living on credit for the moment and passing the debt on to future generations. In October when the new, new debt ceiling is reached, all they can do is make another one...The numbers do not add up anymore, and YOU will get stuck with the bill. at that point we can not negate the psychological effects of how this new perception of reality will effect "people". If people continue to assume this fraudulently created debt and own up to it, a very bad future is in store for all.
If people simply wake up to the reality of the situation, as this movement suggest's, and then rise up against this EVIL and try to replace it with GOOD, then we can get on with humanity. Failing to do so will imperil all of humanity.
All you need to do is wake up and rise

because it is running side by side and its cash out value is based on debt based money...it is slowly being co-opted in front of your eyes..."don't forget to pay your taxes" Um gee I though that was the entire point...that it was supposed to remain and be debt free...
when everyone had concerns about MtGox being solvent, were they worried about how much bit coin they had, or was that solvent in the usd kinda way? we both know the answer.
Bitcoin could be what we want it to be if the organization truly wanted what it has been sold as, a way around debt based money. It could do that with a campaign to relaunch a new version, but this time do  it in the way I described....Bit coin 2,0 would not be anon, it would be initiated by the people for the people, publically and further more, based on the fact that they have an audience now, they could deal a crushing blow to the Central bankers, if they wanted to. By picking a day when the new currency was to be formed, whipping it up, and then releasing the new version, with the intent of removing debt based currency as the norm....but they won't, they won't because the starters are fat and happy and are now in bed with the devil most likely.

its one of the biggest challenges bit has facing it, the over all immaturity and level of unsophistication that the average holder has. Lets be real, the shit has been out since 2009, that's 4 years folks, even the most "seasoned" CC investor has a max 4 years experience, and most of that experience is with the inner workings of the dynamics...not suddenly sitting on millions. Knowing how it works and knowing how to deal with shitloads of cash that you didn't have just the other day are two different things. They will let you make the money very easy, now you will have to work to keep it.

"I do not see a problem with taxing bitcoin, as long as it's reasonable, keeping in mind it's very easy to bypass. "
ya that's what people back in 1914 said, 1 quadrillion dollars in debt later, that didn't pan out so good.
Bitcoin should be seen as the political device that it could be. If it does not step up and use its power for good, someone else will use the model and do just that. There seems to be 3 types. 1. the investor types who don't care about what it is, just as long as they can make some money off of it, 2. The FU government types who like to use it to get back at the man, like the badger. and then there is the 3rd, more rare type, those, such as my self, who know and understand that the path to liberty and freedom is paved with money that is created debt free and only has an apportioned tax applied at its end use. Bitcoin could be so much more than what it is if it simply grew a pair and fought back against the evil instead of coalescing to it.

"government" is a division of the central bank, put in place and owned by the bank and therefore is a usurped "government" that in my mind is not legit based on the facts of how it was put in place. The entire political sphrere is controlled by the central banks, government is a division of the central bank
This is all about money printed as debt...period, bitcoin could have been something that could have taken it down....now it just wants to join in with the rest of the central bank bullshit, so it seems
Perhaps it has been my skewed view that those who participate in bitcoin were aware of the facts...But the more I am here the more I here people talk about "government" and "taxes" like they were sheep or shills

last time I checked we did not collectively own some potato farmers 205 trillion dollars in "debt/ interest" for a loan that they should not be able to make and also we're not on the hook for 600 trillion in "iou's", ie bonds that we are responsible for covering because 565 people told "us" we owe 100 people all this "money"
Are you going to negate the "conspiracy" aspects? The criminal one?  There is no "conspiracy" other than the fact that the Fed is a private corporate bank that is owned by 12 member banks that is made up of all the big banks and the shareholders and board members and that collectively this bank has been granted the rights to create money with debt attached at its inception to which you the citizen are responsible for paying of this "debt" for the "loan".  You currently own this gang of criminals 205 trillion dollars and are on the hook for 600 trillion in "bonds" ie "iou's". you and everyone else pays this debt to your money masters with 28-50% of your income your entire life. All military and social operations have been paid for with borrowed money since the late 60's, thus driving you further into debt. So you are either playing shilly, or you really just don't understand how you are getting so fucked over its like SLAVERY

again just shows what we are really dealing with....your debt free currency will not be "debt free" as long as you are valuing the cash out rate in debt based currency...your only going to "win" if you can effectively get a majority of merchants to accept bit as a point of sale and online exchange....thus usurping the need to ever want or need to use "their" money....
everyone who knows what this is really about knows the problems this is facing...
Basically your trying to tell the Rothschild based banking cartel that you've worked a work around on their money as debt scam and that because you don't use or "make" any of their money you are not subject to your cut of their slave pay.
The best way for bit to truly succeed is for people to try to create regional areas of commerce where only bit is used, with the intent of it spreading like cancer in an outward fashion.
But again, unless you can turn bit into something that ios accepted everywhere and thus push the central banks out of the way by defacto loss of faith or the stopping of the using of their money...your not going to win
edit; also there are two primary factors related to bits expansion, one is relevant the other self destructive...meaning the main goal and intent should be to get bit accepted like money at "stores" be they online or brick, and then the other aspect , the self destructive one, is the "investment" or market style of playing bit in order to make "money" with it.
People are buying low and selling high, if this continues to be the main focus of the bit community, and not the regular implementation of the bit, you will see the question of solvency appear all the time...
What is solvet, are we asking if Gox is solvent in bitcoin, or usd? of course we know we are concerned with how much usd they have, not bit....so really as long as you are valuing your debt free currency, and or ultimately have to or want to exchange it for debt based money you are just going in circles...
If investment, or buying low selling high remains the focus of those involved in it, it will be doomed, because a that point all you are doing is turning it into another forex currency to be bought, sold and then have the profit taxed....If it turns into a situation where someone can buy low, sell high, and then exchange it for usd, and not have it traceable so the rothschilds can get their cut, the central banks will use the government to shut it down and call it a crime, if yo submit to regulation all you have at that point is your idea co opted and destroy the original intent

We’re In The Midst of A Global Currency Reset
 1. The Fed Reserve will merge or absorb into the UST
 2. There IS a global event that has been unfolding during the past ten-plus years. The Basel III Protocols (which includes the Global Currency Reset) have required the cooperation of many nations — 198, to be exact.
 3. What gets in the way from time to time with regard to this Global Currency Reset (as has just happened in the past few days) is political maneuvering and disagreements that delay things.
 4. Fiat currency is becoming a thing of the past due to ongoing pervasive fraud and devaluation of paper currency – now it will have to be backed by assets (precious metals, oil, etc.) China would like to take over the US’s position as holding the world’s reserve currency in hopes to have their currency backed by gold. However, Clinton mentioned in one of her speeches that Iraq will become the richest nation in the world due to its oil, natural gas and gold reserves. Thereby, numerous nations that hold the Iraqi Dinar are looking to the IQD becoming the global reserve currency.
 Basel III (or the Third Basel Accord) is a global, voluntary regulatory standard on bank capital adequacy, stress testing and market liquidity risk. It was agreed upon by the members of the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision in 2010–11, and was scheduled to be introduced from 2013 until 2015; Basel III was supposed to strengthen bank capital requirements by increasing bank liquidity and bank leverage.
 5. Precious metals (gold and silver) prices are manipulated. Currently the price is dropping. Why? Something big is about to happen. 
 The Global Currency Reset will take those 198 nations currency and revalue it up or down based upon that country’s assets. For example, Canada will go up about 20 cents, along with the massive revaluation of VND and IQD. The USD may go down or not depending upon how much IQD they have in reserve – and because had all the other nations that owe the US money agree to pay back what they owe when the reset happens taking the US out of debt.
 Since the US has trillions worth of IQD they can do several things. Exchange the IQD for gold thus taking the USD back to the gold standard. Hence the current USD will be collected and replace by the new currency. New currency expected to be distributed in the fall.
 6. At the G-8 summit this year the talk among nations was how to collect taxes from tax dodgers. Basically the global banking system is tightening up its agreements between nations and will identify those who have been slipping through the current tax holes. Thus more tax return money for the nations who track down their tax dodgers.
 So instead of a crash – which is inevitable given the current fiscal structure, there will be a Global Currency Reset which is in the works.

It is confusing, to know what bitcoin is, for sometime I have always thought it the central bankers toy for changing systems. Particularly after Berneke and the feds said "let it go" but then again anyone who truly understands what is going on and just how things work, understands that there is no government, government is merely a division of the central banks, he with the money is in charge, government does not make the money, government borrows the money from the fed, as most here know. And then if we follow that line of reason further, we come to find that the fed/ecb conglomerate is made up of the 12 member banks that are owned by the "shareholders"....and ofcourse the "shareholders" are all the major private banks, and most know their names, and then if we take that further, we get to the "owners" of those banks,and most know who they are. So what this really shows you is a couple of things...1. BANKS/CENTRAL BANKS IE. THE GUYS WITH THE RIGHTS TO CREATE MONEY, are in charge. and 2. That instead of using the "government" to crack down on Bitcoin, they, those in charge, will simply use the consumer side of control, the banks owned by the shareholders, to squash bitcoin by making it "unfundable". So in a way this makes me happy that bitcoin may infact be "real", yet on the other hand sad, because this is going to be a serious roadblock. Perhaps Bitoin should start valuing itself in Oz. of gold and silver? Frankly as long as bitcoin values itself in "their" money this will always be a problem. By basing its worth on heavy metal, this will make gold and silver go up and put the banks in a bad situation in several ways.
Something must be done and soon, perhaps they are going to use bitcoin as the road to start a revolution so they can crack down on us, nothing like giving you millions and some freedom, only to take it away to make people "antsy"

One of the interesting aspects of bitcoin is that if it is "real" and not controllable by the usa, soon it will give rise to the ability for individuals in certain sectors of the world to collectively as individuals perform "economic hitman" games against the usa, thus "weaponzing" currency. Simply by using bitocoin it undermines the petro dollar. Iran, China, Russia and any anti western countries/groups can via citizenry {no need for government representation} begin to economically attack the usa by simply collectively using bitcoin. As the usa clamps down and restricts it's citizen bitcoin use, this will pump up popularity in these countries and give them a leg up by syphoning away tax revenues because of the lack of restriction. The usa central bankers will put themselves in a hard spot if they restrict it here, but other countries do not. It could fit nicely into a GCR with the BRIC's

hmm, I'm not feeling the love....in order to help our masters while lining our own pockets, it is crucial that a team spirit of unification be projected in a positive manner.
This is new territory, uncharted, one can not expect the same journey that one may find if traveling down a path that has already been mapped. You're part of group of pioneers who are hacking their way through a new fiscal jungle, with known and unknown natives, some of which you are not sure about their state of friendliness. Every hack, virus, loss of wallet, problem with a site or company etc. helps clear the path for the future, a path that you want clear for all the travelers that will come behind you, because ever new traveler will enrich you because of the path that you blazed.
So therefore, one bitcoiners problem is every bitcoiners problem, and teamwork as well as universal understanding that we are a team must be exhibited.
Think of bitcoin and other solid CC's as Sears wrenches, think of any bitcoiners problem as a broken wrench, and that the bitcoin community are all sears employees, and that no matter where we are, like Sears, you can bring in your broken wrench and get it replaced, even if you bought it in Texas, but are now in Idaho, we are here for you.
So in my humble opinion, any bitcoin related "place" should be open to bitcoin problems and therefore hopefully solutions.

For the past 2=3 years the fed has been making money, loaning it to the treasury, which then is turned into bonds, and then those bonds are sold on the open market, however in this case the NO ONE HAS BEEN BUYING,so the fed buys back its own funny money...
It is a circlejerk, you are slowly being economically isolated THE WORLD DOES NOT BELIVE IN YOUR CRAPPY MONEY...you are going to loose reserve currency status and your dollar is already spinning into hyperinflation, your citizens are strapped and broke, your economy is broke and you are totally fucked....in very short time you are going to see full melt down as they will not be able to contain the lie....

bitcoin is showing itself for what it truly is, NOT an alternate for debt based currency, just another form of it...
"Both assets sit outside the dominant fiat currency system and can't be manipulated by governments."
This is a crock of shit, {who here thinks the pm market is not manipulated?}  that is most likely a central bank fronted scheme that is the start of the all holy "one world currency"
if you are basing the value and tangibility of a currency that is debt free with one that is not, it immediately becomes not debt free, this story in itself is double talk...one moment its says "not manipulatable" and yet the mere fact that they want to play by central bank controlled government rules, and thus file with SEC contradicts that statement, if being forced ,or seeming to be forced, into playing by bankers rules all you are doing is creating another "currency" and any profits made from said currency could be likened to playing the forex market...you may be able to use it for transaction, and I guarantee that it will grow in popularity, yet like anything controled by the bankers, they will be able to change the rules anytime they want to...
This is now revealing itself for what it is, a currency that operates outside debt based money, seemingly, but then when it really comes down to it, its just a ruse to suck people in, create legitimacy and acceptance, and then when it comes time, the exchange will be turned back into and be based on, debt based frn's , thus basically being one big circle jerk.
As unpopular as my opinion may seem, I will guarantee that you will see growing acceptance of bitcoin, as it is being promoted by "them" and that in time you will see it's "face" change frm one thing into another...

said it many times "AN UNSOPHISTICATED INVESTOR BASE" "you" panic because one moment you bought a bunch of coins for cheap, forgot about it, and then a couple years later youre a millionaire. "You" are the victim of dumb luck, perhaps brilliant foresight, but the bottom line because "you" do not have much experience day trading, and certainly not lots of experience being "rich". Therefore instability creates a much bigger wave of panic than may happen in other markets because frankly a large portion of the "investor" base have no experience with large amounts of money to suddenly protect.

Do you like and promote money printed as debt? if not do you wish to see bitcoin become something just like it? As I said before "" implies something that sells it self or is established as "real" but is not , or is a crime. "government" is not government for example. Oh sur they are there and in charge, but that does not mean that it is not cover for the central bank.
@_date: 2013-09-09 07:18:33
I give you the short answer for now, "they" the thems, can do whatever the fuck they want to, because you use and have faith in their currency. I don't like talking about it as an investment tool, I like talk about what it could have been, a challenge to central banking. As if we go anywhere, say the conspiracy forum, of which many are supporters of bitcoin, they are supporters because they see/saw it as something that could circumvent the fed....but now, more and more, just turning into another currency with some digitals advantages ...
edit: you are lumping all taxation in the same pile, unapportioned income tax is not apportioned tax. You pay income tax because a private for profit 12 member bank has the rights to create digits on a screen and then "loan" those digits to the corporation of the united states which then levys taxes against the citizens in order to pay off the interest on a loan with real money that was generated with real labor to give to a small group of criminals their profit for loaning out air. Currently you are 17-70 trillion dollars in debt to this corporation that acts like a visa credit card company, that has no money to loan, but still gets to loan it out and charge for that. Not including the 400+trillion dollars in bogus iou's ie. bonds that you the citizens are n the hook for. Currently the Bric nations are colluding with the fed/ecb in order to drop the usd as the reserve, to revalue the 194 member countries. Your invasion of Syria will be the excuse for your people to understand why you got dumped. This way the fed gets to wipe the debt off the books, and then start the scam all over again with a new set of monetary taxable regions. This is why the "convenience" of bit coin will be so "desired". There will be a new global economy, and the usa will not be in charge of it, or at least not in the way that would benefit the people of this country.

ya the second you try to exchange it for FRBN, however if you do not earn usd, and do not spend usd, you are under no obligation to pay taxes as you have made no "money"
from section 31 u.s.c 5103
"There is, however, no Federal statute mandating that a private business, a person or an organization must accept currency or coins as for payment for goods and/or services. Private businesses are free to develop their own policies on whether or not to accept cash unless there is a State law which says otherwise. For example, a bus line may prohibit payment of fares in pennies or dollar bills. In addition, movie theaters, convenience stores and gas stations may refuse to accept large denomination currency (usually notes above $20) as a matter of policy."
Under these conditions, as merchants or someone offering a service, we, are under no obligation to use or settle debts or virtually any other means of exchange, to have to use their currency. We can use marbles if we want to
the problem is of course they wrote this way before bit coin, so I'm sure you'll see some changes quick....
So technically if you buy bit coin, and stay in bitcoin land , do your excahnges only with bitcoin and never use, hold or secure any FRBN's , technically you do not have to pay taxes as you are technically well below the poverty line as you don't use THEIR money....of course we know the merchant/ service level is not there yet....but trust me, what I have just pointed out is the loophole they are worried about....let alone the plunge in the usage and printing of the usd, if people stop using it, they will make no money off interest, as no one is using it, they won't get to create it, no creation, no interest on the loan
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:40:13
it's dipping now, one thing to keep in mind about the average bitcoin investor, most of them are unsophisticated, they do not have years of experience trading, many are just younger people who liked the idea of sticking it to the man, bought some coins cause they were cheap, sat on them, forgot about it, and then woke up rich one morning. That being said these people are very prone to spooking, when you mix that in with people who know how to smell trouble, you get massive pullouts. With all the new crypto currency's, just because one is  now, that does not mean it can and will hold value.

I wish people would stop referring to "governments" as if they were in charge of anything, they are a division of the central banks, the ones granted the rights to create money, bitcoin is threat to central banking, all of this news is about state sponsored money and taxation, which pertains to central banking, not government. I would hope that people here know this, as you seek to be granted legitimacy all you do is put yourselves in their hands. 
@_date: 2013-11-30 21:31:12
well, if there were a team developed, granted security clearance, and one had paid into the optional security of fraud/theft protection, the team go back and trace the blockchain to see where the money went, freeze it, mitigate to find out if the coins were stolen, if so, they then get replaced, and the thief reported to the locals for grand theft, or theft, depending on the amount.
having a team granted rights to investigate bitcrime is not "centralization"....its simply there to serve you when you need them in that if you grant them authority via a complaint, that they have your permission to investigate and that the "bitcoin world" through top level development will grant them access to the inner working of the chain in order to determine where the coins went.
It would be very specialized, and developed to not act like the "police" just determine if there was fraud and then restore your coins
believe me I hate the "idea" of it all, I just think that the sooner bitcoin covers all of its own bases in house, the less likely you will get a bunch of nancy pants crying to mamma government will be able to give them an excuse to be the "security team"...really, in time, as more thefts and frauds happen, you will get people complaining to government, "I lost all my money, make evil bitcoin do something about it"...I just think bitcoin should act preemptively in order to not give government one little crack to squirm through to justify their hands being in it. 
@_date: 2013-08-25 19:06:37
this is about faith, if bit had any hope, it would form an independent team of bit pioneers to form a "charity" group that is funded by bitcoiners to create assimilation teams....these are teams of bitcoiners that are paid in essence by a small contribution of other bitcoiners to form teams, like Mormon missionarys do, to go out with presentations to business's with picture boards and slide shows to explain money printed as debt , how it works and why bitcoin is the way...your going to have a hard time convincing some people, as they feel a strong need for a huge central government....You would be basically asking them to stop paying taxes by simply and legally not using usd anymore, don't earn any, don't pay tax....if in some imaginary world bit took over and people no longer paid taxes, it would be up to the citizens at that point to restructure government as all services would fail based on having no operational capital based on no tax revenue.
So this is much more complex, and I don't think many in bit are strategizing the long term war game scenarios, just lots of people hoping the price goes up, as if they were buying low and selling high...
if that continues to be the focus, its doomed to be crushed or co opted

ya but wouldn't you rather have a government that served you instead of having to crawl around like a criminal just so you can spend money you rightfully earned?...you will not have a government that allows you to be free because the government is run and controlled by the central banks, bitcoin or a peoples faith based currency has the ability to knock out the central banks, thus allowing you to regain control of your government. A good government does not want or need to steal your money via un apportioned taxation, it wants you to keep what you earn, it does not need to be a vehicle for borrowing....I was under the assumption that many here in bitcoin land had an understand of money printed as debt....but the more I am here I see that is not the case. Thus making it even more possible to pull the wool over peoples eyes and or just get them to look at it as an investment for making money...at that point just another index on the forex...Again if bitcoin just ends up being something that ends up being taxed and regulated like FRBN's, why bother at that point?
The point I am trying to make is that people see bitcoin as something that runs parallel with a existing criminal currency Ponzi scam and must learn to coexist with it and the puppet government it controls which mandate the "regulations" what I am saying is that bitcoin or a similar model has the ability to remove the evil scam and the evil government that is controlled by the money printed as debt scam

as long as they cannot control the creation, the more they invest, the more the price goes up, but they can not control the market so to speak, only be heavily vested in it. However they could cause panick by snapping them up, and then doing a mass dump, which would cause panic selling...again the big picture is to make CC the standard currency, not use it to make lots of theirs, there will be many cycles based on rumor and panic.

co-opting is moving in on something, in this case the central bankers , that would be the shareholders in the FED and ECB, including but not limited to the Rothschilds, Kuhns, Loebs, Wharburgs, Oppenhiemers, Rockerfellers, etc. who own the current Ponzi scam called the usd, and are fraudulently charging "income tax"  in a bond swap credit scam, you know the people you are suggesting paying tax to.

They can do so because nothing is secure. How bout this one, use it all you want,just make sure you register so you can be taxed...IF you get caught being an "unscanable one" you will face a 20 year term and 100,000 fine for using an illegal currency. Tor is not safe, none of the machines hardware you are using is safe, no level of communication you use is safe. Transaction signature algorythms can be developed in order to send out digital agents to scour the web for "illegal" transactions. I don't think the central banker controlled government is going to let any new hardware companies flourish, there will be no SoftMicro or no new "Pear" making clean machines for you to use...So what then we get guys whacking out shit in their garages, and then what, not long before  your busted for using illegal computer devices, or heck being an illegal merchant dealing with the bit....My posts in the other thread have been voted off, but the more you understand where I am coming from, the more you will see I am right. Bitcoin is becoming a threat, or being made to seen that way...It is big enough to tax now, and they will do so...The only way to win is my way, bitcoin has to relaunch with an aggressive campaign that is more of a political movement that is based in a monetary one.

Bitcoin is one of two things, either real and a direct threat to central banking, or it's the central bankers corralling you from one pen to another...either way, if you got in early, your wallet is fat...the question becomes if they can stop it or not, or maybe , do they want to stop it?

my take from another sub
"indeed, something tells me "they" not quark per se' as much as those behind the premine have something up their sleeve, it's either going to tank and get wiped out, or it's going to the moon..., cryptsy reported a "glitch" on a tweet awhile ago...something's up, my spider senses are tingling. Something tells me as soon as it goes back online that it is time to speculate there is pre media hype with the Still thing. something tells me a move is about to be made, an investor pool forming for a swan dive for a massive pump, I think its the westies trying to gain an upper hand before it gets" shanghi'd, if you get my drift."

The long term goal is clear, DESTROY CENTRAL BANKING AND USURY!....money printed as debt must die....I would encourage programmers to create  networks of open source currency that is both competing yet interchangable. Several 
"brands" of bit like currency's should be circulating at the same time. The Centralization, by having only one brand is potentially dangerous.....there should be several and they should be interchangeable. If one goes down or is attacked, another can bolster it up or replace it, and if that goes down another to replace it....
The central banker controled government will do anything to stop bitcoin...the mass murdering theives will stop at nothing....WE MUST take back control by taking back the currency....bitcoin is a great idea, the only way to take the greed out of currency creation is to not have humans be in control of the creation. The must be several alternates and dualities with several "brands" all using the same valuation system

ya but again those transactions you are describing are in $.Bitcoin is not $, the second it gains "legitimacy" or is granted the staus of "money" by lord Rothschild, as Germany has, then it will just be another Rothschild device for debt slavery. And we need to define "tax" are we talking about unapportioned income tax, or are we talking about apportioned tax, such as sales tax.
The more it turns into just another type of "money" the more it become just like everything else and therefore moot.

As I said, starts out one way, turns into something else, in time you may be able to pat yourself on the back knowing that you did your part to usher in all digital one world currency, which has been their number one goal.
The more bitcoin stands back and just sits there as a "forex" exchange currency, and the more it subjects itself to regulation and taxation, the more it shows you what it truly is.
If bitcoin is pure, it would make a stand, risk annihilation and go for the gold and try to free us from money as debt slavery. Not be complicit

see this is thing, people focus on that aspect, that is what is great about it and what COULD make a CC "win"...BUT look at it from the gangsters perspective. I can be created "decentralized and debt free" all that matters is FEARING you into paying tax on it. That all your current usd scam is, an elaborate way to extract profit from you via tax. And that is ALL that will matter with bitcoin, they don't care so much about the inner workings, they just want a cut and will use their enforcement division "government" to get it.
they give away "free" money to those who got in, this draws others in, in a frenzy and then slowly we see "regulations" which will simply boil down to your wallets somehow being registered, monitored and somehow you paying a tax or fee of some sort to "them"
The saving grace in this is that if bit is eventually co-opted, others can start...
edit; also keeping in mind that bitcoin is exchange and valued in "currency"  this is another way for "usd" to be generated....created virtually, then suddenly this creates a need for the currency to be created to back the new "value" of the bitmoney...the idealistic intent of bitcoin is good, but that does not mean bad people can't take it over.

wait are you saying that when "meetings" with "government" officials that have recently happened, that there is no "body" of individuals who went to go and represent bitcoin? Or would I have been free to go to these meetings and represent bitcoin, as I can't control how people use it either, but I have my opinions like everyone else. Somehow I don't think the board would have liked it if I showed up and declared I was going to speak on the behalf of bitcoin, as well its decentralized so no ones in charge so I can represent it just like they can? I don't think so. Knowing how it works is not really what this is about, it's understanding that you have 2 basic groups using the bit for different reasons. One group thinks its a big fu to the central banks, likes to use it for illegal shit, likes to use it to dodge taxes etc. The other see's it as a nifty currency exchange that you can make a buck off of , is convenient and "global" a begs to become "legit" which includes being regulated by the very people that the first group I mention oppose.

I agree, I think the real crux of this gets down to how much one understands central banking, what it is, what money as debt is, how unapportioned taxation is related to that and how much that bothers "you"
I think most here understand money printed as debt, understand the way the FED works, and know that the income tax they are paying is not going to social services, but that most of it goes to pay off the interest for a loan that never should have been made. Most understand that central banking is a Ponzi/credit scam that serves a few.Bitcoin if not coopted has the ability to undermine this crime gang. If coopted it has the ability to "save" the central bankers.

tell them this...they are slaves to the central banks, they do not have a government, they have a division of the central bank that calls itself government. The money is in charge of the country...When the government shut down, it was because the "credit card" was maxed out, so "all powerful government" had to crawl to "Uncle Visa" {that's the federal reserve,..its not federal, nor a reserve} and ask for more credit on the credit card so "we" could limp along another few more months living on borrowed money...So they got a raise on their credit limit and got to borrow more money from people who don't have any...just the right to make it from thin air....Now, after they "loaned" this money to 
"government", that was not done for free...Just like Visa makes money loaning money in interest...so does the Fed...So, currently this nation, on the books owes' this "corporation" 17+ trillion dollars, more like 205 trillion...and then you tell them that when they go get a job, or try to start their own business that all the income tax money that will be taken from them goes to pay off the interest on a loan that was taken out by people that don't have any....you tell them these guys own the tv stations, tell you how to vote and for who, then put their guy in and make sure you talk about anything other than what I just told you...Its a gang, a carny scam, muggsy put some guy in the "boss" chair to play the "boss" while the real boss is raking in the dough on a credit scam...you then tell them bitcoin is a machine with a program that will not deviate, has no greed as it is a machine and that most importantly when a bitcoin is created, there is no debt attached to its creation...and then you tell them that bitcoin will set them free...and then you tell them that after it sets them free, that the Rothschild will somehow figure a way to fuck it all up

Any Abelian group G can be visualized as a lattice. A subgroup H of G is a sublattice, and the cosets of H are all the shifts of that sublattice. The Abelian hidden subgroup problem is normally solved by obtaining superposition over a random coset of the Hidden subgroup, and then taking the Fourier transform so as to sample from the dual lattice. Rather than generalizing to non-Abelian groups, one can instead generalize to the problem of identifying hidden subsets other than lattices. this problem is efficiently solvable on quantum computers for certain subsets defined by polynomials, such as spheres.

all that need happen is the ability to tax it, you are using it as a 
"debt free" currency at this moment in time. When it first started it had zero "regulation", and now what do we see? slowly creeping in, REGULATION, and even have the site itself telling you to PAY YOUR TAXES...If you think for one second that those who control the world by being able to control the creation and velocity of currency are just going to "oh well" this, you have another thing coming. If ten years goes by {without dying by being nuked} and bitcoin becomes the standard currency and it is allowed to operate as "debt free" and or there is no one entity creating debt on the inception of the currency I WILL JUMP OFF A PLATFORM 1000 FT.

therefore ergo it is useless and shows itself to be what it truly is. The Rothschilds initiation of global one world currency. Using the "kids" to get it started off.
As I have said, you can not have a debt free currency running congruent with a debt based currency where as the cash out value of the debt free currency is based on the debt based one.

the more I think about it the more imo it MUST happen, we will be the ones "manipulating" the metal, not them, we will become the biggest holders of gold and silver, not them, by basing the value in metal, it makes it so it goes , bitcoin, converted to gold/metal, then that can be converted to "money" if needed. By putting the value in gold first, it makes it so bit is converted before it hits the banks...or in other words, the banks may be able to stop one from using their bank if they are doing "bitcoin to USD" but will the banks turn away money from metal exchanges? and how are they to control that. The gold and silver world would LOVE us to use metal as a backer, the price of gold would go up and bitcoin will be based on a stable time tested commodity.
IF BITCOIN DEVELOPERS DO NOT SEE THIS AS THE OBVIOUS CHOICE,,,,THEY BETTER because as I am writing this, competitors of other alt coins are working on this right now. The first one to adopt valuation in metal will be the winner. 
Can't go bit to usd, fine, go, bit to gold, then to "money", use the metal as the "buffer" between bit and the banks....fucking brilliant

I'd rather make Bill Still rich one time, and maybe his heirs...then allow a dynasty to pop up that last from 1694 till present that ends up enslaving the world with debt.

the more I understand this the more it differs very dramatically form forex trading. Whats going on is latency...it is a HUGE problem related to "day trading" currencies. I think what many are starting to realize is this..."Hey, I see the trends, I watch these coins, I get a feel for it, I can "feel" when they are going to go up, and I can feel when they are going to go down. HOWEVER there is built in latency, which I think is intentional, partially a byproduct of the system. First, in order to "play" it seems that the "system" will dictate you use bitcoin as the primary coin for purchasing other alt currency...Ok so lets say you see the lite coin jump, you want in, but oh, don't have btce min 2g's....so you buy a smaller amount of bitcoin in order to buyt litecoin, as you know its going to pop...uhoh, takes a WEEK to get your bits, by that time the rise and fall already went by....Now when we look at trading alt currency, same thing but different, you see them go up, you buy in, but when it comes time to sell, you can't dump them quick enough, so you get stuck.
The best thing to do is to put long positions on several coins that your have researched and feel good about, hold...you can dump easy when there is a frenzy, but when things are cold, shit don't move quick enough, those lulls in time kill any grand ideas of buying low, selling high on the fly...the system does not work quick enough. So you have to buy low, hold, wait, the sell in a frenzy...elsewise, I'm quickly seeing this as too slow to make quick moves

tellin ya, bitcoin better get it's act together and respond to this banker intrusion. There are other coins working on basing their value in PM, the only way to work around the bankers is base things on real intrinsic value, that they don't have their hands on....Gold. Fed is going to taper soon, what do you want your bitcoins based on worthless fiat paper? Why, when you could go for gold? bit better get its thing together and soon, others are going to start basing exchange on PM sooner than later, if bit does not adapt it will get left behind....fiat currency is so yesterdays fashion...gold is yesterday, yesterdays fashion....such a better cloth really.

there will be enough coins to jump to and others will increase as others want quick virtual cash like those who got in early on bitcoin...once the model has been demonstrated successful, unless hinderd somehow, litecoin will be next and it's a toss up for the one after that..."they" tptb will allow these CC to take off for awhile so they gain popularity, and everyone is using them, they will use the "free money" and or allow buy low/sell high crowd to make shitloads, as well as acting as a tax shelter account for quite some time to draw people into using it, and then when they have everyone hooked, they will implement taxation, registration and whatever they need to do to get their cut....on ALL CC
bitcoin has reached a level too high for the average guy, now the rich will pile in as they see it as a "mobile swiss bank account"...all the "what about me" crowd who did not get in, but are now aware, of CC will gang up on litecoin as we now see...with a bigger total amount of coins it will take longer to hit triple digits but it will get there, and thus create a new wave of lite wealth...this is very critical to the plan, old money invested in stock is staying to "in house" they need a way to inject prosperity into a new generation in order to move to the next phase

It's pretty clear that bitcoin is shaping up to be a sneaky trick run by the same central bankers you are trying to defeat...One world currency made conveniently hip and underground...all bitcoin has to do is establish itself, once enough are on board, watch the "rules" slowly start to change
Back when they started the Fed one of the only mistakes they made was eventually having a few people be privy to who was involved in starting it....Bitcoin however takes care of that nasty future problem of being hunted down by the restless natives..."Started anonymously" how convenient that there will be no one to point the finger at 100 years from now.

@_date: 2013-12-07 09:07:00
lets look at the bigger picture, there are no countries or governments, they are merely there for you, the sheep, there are farms, farmers and tax cattle. On the macro level the farmers collude together in order to maximize yield. The present global money printed as debt scams are reaching a crash and burn period whereas the debt burden will not be able to be sustained based on "we the sheeple" no longer able to "pay up" thus driving the façade governments further into deficit spending. Governments exist simply as legitimizers of central banks and of course as the sole borrowers of said currency, there to rack up the debt as much as possible. Psychological manipulation of the thought process is an inherent mechanism within the tool chest of the farmers. Basically you have one scam dying, that being fiat, and another being born, the replacement, that being the bit. The transitional stage and period must be drawn out over a prolonged period of time. The events in china are simply a governor placed on the throttle to slow the pace down. They, the central bankers have created the crypto markets to appear to be counter central bank, when nothing could be further form the truth. Anyone who truly understands debt free currency creation knows that it puts the power of money back into the hands of the people. If you think for one second that the central bankers would let bitcoin get to a one million dollar market cap before shutting it down, you would be mistaken. China colludes with the western central banks, they are all bedfellows, Farmers who are unfriendly to each other, yet forced to work together. China has intentionally down shifted the buggy to slow the speed, the speed was "unnatural" and made for an unhealthy pace. Remember, bitcoin, a money device, is created "debt free" yet is valued in and on debt based currency. So when a lad buys 1000 dollars of bitcoin in 2009, and suddenly  the other day its worth 100 mil. That was a form of money creation for the central bank, something they will benefit from. This also will allow for some western catch up, as the 60/40 balance will shift. Bottom line bitcoin is a see saw that is being stepped on by fat guys, it's theirs but they want you to think its your, and they will succed. In the mean time there will be plenty of money to be made, the long term hope for bitcoin is that the people "buy into it" and accept it, then slow insertion will happen  as we see now, the hope is that the people do not figure out that it is theirs and that it succeds, if too many people suddenly perceive it as a device of the bankers, they will loose faith, as that is the reason many people are into bitcoin, they think it is anti central banker, anti money printed as debt. So it can not be welcomed in too fast to maintain appearances and not look fake, thus the China shakedown today, keeping it real looking. The banks want this to succeed, but on their timeframe and in their way and therefore it will most likely do so. Like I said lots of money to be made, as well as to be lost. Be careful and try to look at the big picture. Money is in charge of the world, not "government"...government does not make the money, they borrow it, the people they borrow it from run the world.
You are right it will drop, this will allow for an entire new round of down the road millionaires when it goes back up. This is the free money swiss bank account phase, different farms will have their own take on assimilation

if china is going to mandate that people register their accounts at that point it will not be much different than state sponsored fiat, which was the entire intent behind the bit movement. Contrary to what many would like to think, bitcoin is not popular because it is a nifty way to do banking, it is popular because people perceive it as a way around "the man"...take that away, you won't have much
@_date: 2013-11-26 08:24:48
As mathematically perfect as the model may be  I see some potential major flaws that I have not seen addressed nor do I hear about any predictive planning related to the problem, which is also troublesome. First I would say that there are many types of people who are into bitcoin for different reasons. 1. the investor type, not motivated politically as much as just by profit. 2. the hopeful youth/"conspiracy theorist" who understands money as debt and wants to stick it to the man. 3. some type of combination of the two, and finally there will be all the late coming sheep who just want in on the gravy train.
At any rate , lets assume that bitcoin continues to go up based on several factors, and lets now assume that state sponsored debt based money continues to go down. This  will be a cycle that for some time will drive the price of bitcoin up, as what it is valued in is going down. Then comes the day when bitcoin has driven fiat currency out of existence,...and then what? what is bitcoin now valued on? itself? The developers should be working on what to do about the fact that it is valued in a currency that it is trying to take down, and when that happens what is the contingency for valuation of bitcoin...There will be plenty of advance warning during the later part of this process...if bitcoin and other crypto currency wants to "win" they better have a plan ready to implement to protect the value of the bitcoin well before the value of the currency which it is basing its value on goes k'put...or is there somewhere where this is addressed by the hancho's? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 10:55:09
I think the biggest problem is that bitcoin bases its value on their currency. a debt free currency based on a debt based currency is not going to work in the long run, bit should start basing itself on gold weight and pm'seither that or revalue itself on an arbitray figure of "worth", something that could be exchanged for their currency, but why?
@_date: 2013-11-23 04:29:32
for every brick and mortar type business that relates to money in the real world, one will be needed for the newbitorder. 
One of the great things about the bitcoin evolution is that not only will it create new wealthy people who made money by investing, but it will create a new economy based on all the business ideas that will pop up around it. In your case, you are requesting a "bitcoin insurance policy" simply buy into a capped policy and for a mere 55$ a month or .000004352000002 bitcoin you can sleep well rest assured that your bitcoins will be replaced if lost or stolen. YOu bought into the  up to 50,000 cap....if you had more bit to protect, you would need to up your policy limits...just like "real life" cept now it's bitlife....

No intrinsic value??? how about the planet you live on??? The PM "biz" and everything that surrounds it is an EARTH KILLING adventure. BITCOIN and other CC is an environmental SAVIOR. For every bitcoin that generates the same amount of wealth that 1 oz of gold does, you SAVE THE PLANET. I'm not sure if anyone here or Mr Schiff have seen metal mining operations, but they are not clean and are pretty much landscape rapist's. If you want to stop the destruction of the planet, reduce environmental waste and save wildlife, flora and fauna. Use BITCOIN and other CC. The environmental aspect is an area that has yet to be promoted and in time you will see other environmental groups start to "link" up with bitcoin world. The amount of petro fuels burned to run mining operations for coins pales in comparison to the amount of petro fuels needed to mine metal. In time this fact will start to become more promoted...Save the whales use bitcoin
edit; as bitcoin and other CC takes off, you will see the price of gold and silver plunge, a prediction

oh yes they do, well some, but it's spreading,and now that the cat and the model are out of the bag, it's gonna get ugly, here's why...Lets say bit coin has a great run and hits 1000, ok, so lets say, an arbitrary number of say 1mil people got in and made a shitload, well that's great, but at that point 1000 a coin gets to be too much for the average guy, so then what happens? the "where's mine"? well that's when people will jump to the next best platform, which at this point seems to be litecoin, thus starting the entire process all over again where as those who get in early will make shitloads and then it eventually will top out, and then that where the next group comes in, and again and again, until the central banks fold....this however is where the government will step in...don't look at this ride to last without international interference spearheaded by the central bankers fed/ecb. But for now the game is on, and well if we play our cards right , it may be out of their hands. And then a day will come where things are not valued in central banker currency and then the war can stop because the borrowing scam is dead...like the wicked witch

like I said, use the "bitcoin principle" {using the internet to decentralize corrupt centralization} and apply it to an internet based election process. Where tv propaganda and money are not part of the choosing process, let a candidate campaign anonymously through a "official" website with no money or tv propaganda allowed. This way the field will be narrowed down by choosing someone for their ideas and not how much money they have or what they look like. Hell it's we the people new election process, so we the founder{just like the founders of bitcoin} can take our time and work on the details in a democratic way to perfect a new election process.
You will not have monetary change through political means, you will not have monetary change until the current election process is negated. The media is owned by the corporate owners and shareholders, it will be up to "we the people" to take back what is ours, in the same exact way that bitcoin does.

If it was pure and for the benefit of all, it would not been started anon, nor would it have started subversively.

@_date: 2013-12-03 03:43:35
I think maybe 1% of the population if that is involved in CC, as time goes by that percentage of people will increase dramatically, I mean there are still plenty of people to get onboard the CC train and that every CC has the ability for the people to regain the wealth that was lost via extraction from the central banks, so I think we are a long way off from 100 going to zero...we either have one CC that is "it" and is subdivided between 3-4 billion people, or we have several CC sub divided by that amount if people, either way, as long as the currency is not a privately owned product, printed with debt attached, regardless if it is just one CC or several, we the people will come out better for it.

Also, would it not be helpful to have celebrity's involved in promoting bitcoin? I may be able to help, along with others in this dept. But I think I would need to be convinced by the people that it was "pure" based on what the "people" see it as. I still am confused by the make a buck guys, mixed with the change the system guys

The enemy is not decentralized currency, the enemy is what you are valuing your future in. people who are into bit and other CC simply to make some cash are not in it for the right reason...there will always be winners and losers...the key is for the ideology to win...I don't care if junk coin becomes number one, or any other for that matter, as long as the central banks go down.

no the fed is not government, it is a private corporation made up of private corporations that have a charter/contract to create the currency supply, it has been granted this "right" by government, government that it puts in place.. It's not "conspiracy" bs it is a criminal conspiracy, very factual and easyily researchable and verifiable. Go to utube and watch Hitlers movie the eternal jew, funded by him, he goes on about the central banks and their owners, Say what you want about Hitler, but it is right there in black and white and historical fact. I guess it was just such a "conspiracy theory" that it plunged the world into ww2. Seems kinda extreme if its all just based on a theory. Plenty of facts out there to be had. People who cry "conspiracy" basically have a "school version" ie winners version of history which is false indoctrination as well as bitcoin being now closely associated with opposing central banking and thus bring a new round of fresh shills from elgin afb to come here and say what you will. Just like in the conspiracy forums, average people don't hang out at conspiracy forums, nor do they talk about or defend the fed, they just watch dancing with the stars...so I and others find it funny that people would bother to come to r-bitcoin to bash it. See your either into bitcoin or you don't know about it or care about it. I am not here bashing bitcoin...I am bashing what I know to be the problem, cental banking and the power structure. You only have your head in the rabbit hole from what I hear, again I say that you don't understand how it works, nor am I suggesting that anyone just create money out of thin air...the problem is attaching debt to currency creation...government that is for the people by the people does not enslave its own citizens with debt for using their currency supply....and thus government does not serve you, they serve the master.the creator, and as long as "you have faith in the creator, it shall be your god

yup, if left to its own devices it will easily remove central banking...here again it might be theirs from the get go...here again,again...regardless, the "path" or mathematical model has been demonstrated to be effective, and if bitcoin does not end up taking the central banks down, another currency will, or certainly has a chance to...the day bitcoin will have won is the day it is no longer valued in usd or any other global "state" issued currency, yet has established an arbitrary fixed value and just has a denominational value based on a number. This of course opens up doors for other crypto currency, Zerocoin's idea of unification is grand, and will do well

Is a "board" not a form of central control?...Its creation process may not generate debt from its inception but its control and its propaganda are definitely controlled by sentient beings.
I have been aware of bit from the get go, and one things that I have seen as an observer is a definite shift of the "sales" pitch and or "rumors" of "what t is" I know when I see something start as something, I know what I hear when I listen to the chatter, and I hear how that has changed as the seeking and promotion of legitimacy becomes paramount. In a very condensed period of time this is like standing back and watching flower children of the 60's turn into corporate yuppies in 5 years. I have seen what it was when it was young, and I have seen in a very short period of time where it seems to want to go. I understand exactly how mediums of exchange work, and what you need to understand is you have factions within this theater of operation. Bitcoin will go in the direction the board would like it to go. Not really in the direction of the people who had hope for it being revolutionary.
I think many had high hopes for bitcoin to stand against the federal reserve, money printed as debt and to be able to break the chains. Not suck up to it.

Anarchy conjures up visions of a post apocalyptic mad max scenario for most. but the truth about cohesive anarchy is that it is a state of not needing rules and laws because "EVERYONE" knows what the right thing to do in all situations related to interactions with others at all times. The "right thing" needs no definition and has no debate about what is right...It is just known

the concept of bitcoin is much bigger than bitcoin...the core concept of what bitcoin is, is using the internet to decentralize corrupt centralization. Now the beautiful thing about that concept is that it works for other things besides money. Money, currency supplies, as those of us here who know how it works, are privately owned "cartels" for lack of better term. But what other things can we apply this Bitcoin concept to? Why, how about the election process? instead of relying on a centralized and owned media {1600 outlets owned by 6 who are owned by the banks} we the people can apply the bitcoin concept to the election process and remove the corruption and criminal conspiracy aspect of the election process. Take the tv, money and lies out of the election process, and you will have real leaders who will serve the will of the people, not the "1%"

well, if you move, pay your taxes before you do so, then renounce your citizenship and then cash out some bitcoin in your new country,  what? don't you understand? Look the sub bitcoin can play "shill coy" all day long, press for "legitimacy", remind one to pay taxes, on and on, but everyone knows the reason bit is where it is, is because it is a direct assault to central banking and money printed as debt, as the truth spreads about the central banker scam, people want to be free from it, bitcoins success is a direct billions of dollar testament to that reality as people see it as the bypass to the central baking system. So it is quite clear the usd Ponzi scam is crashing, and bits price reflects that and people who suddenly find themselves flush with bit cash may want to think about gtfod before it crashes. that's all, seems pretty clear.

all that matters is this....state sponsored "money" is a product that is owned by private hands and is created with debt attached to it, crypto is not.
So again the real future problem for Bit and crypto is that it bases its value in and on state sponsored money.
If it is going to be a long lasting thing, it must be easily used and not valued in state based currency

when I think of "centralization" I think of a small group of people running a usury scam, the "centralization" is within the creation of the currency...Bitcoin will always have the non greedy machine making the money. The question I pose, is how can bitcoin protect its users while being as "decentralized" as possible. I am not opposed to agreed on security measures, I am opposed to central creation with debt attached. Just because we are not "centralized" does not mean we can not create laws, rules and measures of recourse without destroying the core of what bitcoin is. Whiny bitches are what bring the government in, it gives them and excuse to get inside under the guiss of "protection" if bitcoin does this preemptively, that will cut gov off at that pass and give them one less reaon to stick their nose in it...imo

Bitcoin in its architecture is a solid platform. Those who understand faith based currency know it works great. Bitcoin is proof of this. The problem with bitcoin is how it was started, who started it, and when, meaning.
Bitcoin was started anonymously by a "unknown" group of persons, and remained as a slow underground "movement". There are problems with this, without going into the details of that, I will say that what should have happened, would be; that bitcoin was announced as a new "ideology" to counter the evil that debt based money is. It should have been ramped up publically as much as possible. At that point there would be a "public" knowledge about the "device" that bitcoin is to become. By doing so the initiation of the launch can preserve its integrity and intent. Meaning, collectively a group of people, in a public way desired to create this alternate currency in a way where everyone who was involved with the "movement", how every many that would be would, understand, that at its inception it was something that was started FOR THE PEOPLE BY THE PEOPLE. 
Now to the when, as it is clear that bitcoin has been sold as a FUCK YOU CENTRAL BANKERS AND YOUR TAX MONEY AS DEBT SCAM!...but kinda done in a slow subversive "insiders" slowly spreading way, this has also made suspect it's intent, and or provides a "smokescreen" and the ability to just "pop up" one day by the central banker controlled media's propogation of it in the news. By doing so, it undermined what a peoples based bitcoin currency COULD have been, an actually big fuck you to the central bankers....
In short wht I am saying is this. A currency that works just like bitcoin, that also has a corresponding paper currency, is to be announced, that its inception will be publically started by the people {a large group} as a declaration of independence from debt based money. There would be a ramping up stage that allows time for people to understand why they need to switch currency systems and to prepare to do so, along with their fellow man. This would also allow for the time to write the program and create the debt free paper version. And most importantly what this does is get a huge amount of people, in a global fashion to be able to, all at once , 3,2,1 BAM! drop the debt based currency, AS THATS WHAT ITS REALLY ABOUT, RIGHT? 
So by a huge number of people all at once at the same time, who are in agreement, drop the debt currency, allowing for a swap out, so no one looses anything, then you will get what you want. The only way you are going to defeat the Rothschilds is by collectively boycotting their currency systems. And as real as bitcoin seems, based on the way, who an how it was started, leaves open too many suspicious avenues, and the markers that it is slowly being regulated, and telling you to pay your taxes, show it for what it most likely is.
IF!bitcoin was "REAL" it would take the plan I have just outlined, and do a RAMPING UP publically, to relaunch a "bitcoin" 2...As by this point their are enough people on board to effectively be a political movement. Bitcoin 1 owners currency would exchangeable for bitcoin 2's....
If bitcoin was real, it would do just that, it would use its power for good, and stop this murderous credit scam and free the world from debt slavery...it has the power by having the public eye....but what is it telling you to do
pay your taxes....FAIL!
I seek programers and a public platform to launch such a plan as I have outlined....If bitcoin is real it will take my plan and relaunch, if it is not real, it will be swallowed by the peoples new currency, as the plan is already in action.
So , what is it mr. bitcoin? are you real? doyou want to free humanity from debt slavery? or are you just pretending....ramp up, realaunch, take back your lives.
The day is 4-1-14...bitcoin will be there, or be square.

capital gains laws would only apply if it was converted into fiat. define increased wealth, if we are not using FRBN how can we define "wealth" if you and I have an agreement to do business together and we pay each other for our exchanges using feathers that we both think look cool, we can do so, the reality is government would not care, as it was pretty much just you and I doing this. However the minute, as we see, that lots of people start doing the same thing, then suddenly it becomes a threat because "they" start loosing revenue. And that is the only reason we are having this discussion.
If I buy bitcoin low and sell high, I have made a profit, emphasis on "sell" as at that point it was converted. If however I have a landlord, a gas station and a grocery store that all use and accept bitcoin and I never use or convert bitcoin to FRBN's. I have never made or used any "money" and therefore am not subject to unapportioned income taxation. If the merchants are not using "money" they are not subject to apportioned sales tax, nor am I, as again, we are not using their money, regardless of if the goods or labor has value and would be taxable with the use of "money"
Again all I see is something that was touted as being de-centralized and that the "creation" of the "currency" not having debt attached to its creation....now turning into something that is itching to be taxed.
If you are suggesting that the currency has always been taxable, why is this post being posted? is the post not about "trying to tax it"? how could they be trying to tax it if it has "always ben taxable".
So not sure who the "core developers" is, but it would benice if he would clarify some things;
Is your intention as a core developer, and someone who has wealth vested in bitcoin, someone who has the best intentions for your fellow man, to create a currency that is not created with debt attached to it, a currency that is designed to undermine debt based slavery and central banks....
or are you just some guys trying to create a nifty alternative to a debit card with a money that has a diferent name, but is still subject to regulations like all other currency, because at that point, please explain what's the real difference between it and a FRBN?
I think most who got into bit at first did so because they felt it was a way to tell the central bankers to fuck off, the more time that goes by, the more it looks like they are in cahoots.
What is this developers position?
legal tender laws are very relevant

ok, first you have to understand central banking and your monetary system, if you do not understand that, you will not understand the "reason" for bitcoin...I'll assume you'r some sheepy type guy...so basically you probably think your federal reserve system is part of the government, it's not, it's a private bank owned by all the bigbanks, they have no money, they just get to create it, they make up some digits on a screen and loan them to "government" you bust you ass and pay 40%/50% of you income you entire life as tax" but really that's just the central bankers profit for "loaning" you air...or you bust your ass they sit back and control the world and enslave you with debt....
So that's kinda where bitcoin comes in, but first you have to be able to think like a gangster...we'll get to that latter. basically bitcoin was ALLEGEDLY invented in order to bypass the "system" however, as anyone who knows anything about the Rothschilds, Kuhns, Loebs, Bauers, Oppenheimers etc. is that they are SMART...and it might have been there from the get go, or maybe they just "moved in" 
So as bitcoin increases in popularity they, the central bankers loose out on their cut...or do they?...so what we see is that either it was theirs from the get go, designed to seem, as it is, all the while just waiting for it to get big enough to slowly insert themselves...or it is "real" but now the big money has moved in and "co=opted"/taken over/inserted themselves in so they can control it, which really just means tax it, and or shake their cut out of the deal....
So now they use the "protect the children" "don't do drugs, drugs are bad" kinda "moral" approach by suggesting that bitcoin transactions be traced or "montored" so "naughty" coins and or coins used for nefarious reasons will be "culled" from the "good" bitcoins that do things like buy puppy dog breath instead of 12 year old hookers in a box...
ofcourse anyone with a "crime iq" understands that these are all signs of either co=opting, or super clever planning from the start....Either way, central bankers aren't going to let anything go without getting their cut.
And well basically as long as your changing in and valuing bitcoin on "central banker" currency, ask your self, who's really in charge...
Ofcourse the dream of "real" bitcoiners is to have it negate central banker currency and become the new debt free/freedom based money
So as bitcoin ,looses fans based on regulation, you will see other competitors move in...ones who will sell it up how it should be...right now half the people on this sub are shills saying stuff like "I just cashed out, don't forget to pay your taxes" :}

yes and if we ask all those who live under these regimes, I call them tax farms, we see that the only ones who really like these systems are those that benefit from them whereas the populations often coalesce to "what everyone else is doing" and say "that's just the way it is" of course if one studies the dynamics of this peer group think what we find is the influence of "media" and or monarchy/state based propaganda and flat out lies being the source of this one dimensional paradigm of the view of the "way things are". My suggestions to do a "bitcoin" to the way we as people choose our leadership and laws is the next progressive step in participative manifest destiny of the individual and societal group. Fairness, honesty and integrity can be brought back to humanity if we as a people can manipulate the environmental tools of technology to produce the outcome we desire. 
Currently the worlds election processes are "Controlled" events that are dictated by your local "media" which are "owned" and have a vested interest in dictating the outcome through several established tactics, such as declaring who you can choose from. I suggest that a global initiative be acted on in order to regionally, as prescribed by the inhabitants of said districts, to decentralize a current centralized election processes that serve the "1%" and to allow the internet, through a "bitcoin" like process decentralize the election systems away from the "1%" and to centralize them back to the 99%....Or in simple terms....create a blockchain like "id" for voting in your district, a personal voter number. At that point a sanctioned website {the founders} shall create a platform where perspective canidates may nominate themselves for candidacy in the respective position that they seek and may then put forth, in great detail, in a open forum, their ideas and in essence vie for the peoples support based on their ideas and solutions to the problems that need be addressed. after a narrowing down of "elections within the elections" by posting text,video, or recorded explanations and the people have made their choices, then and only then may they be "released" to "mainstream media, this will allow for the PEOPLE! to decide who will be in charge. Not the tv. After, for example, in the usa, the choices for the top 2 canidates ,for president have been chosen, the people will use their voter blockchain number to vote, this way the integrity of the tally will be preserved with mathematically encrypted perfection.

bubble, maybe, maybe not this is really new territory. One of the things people who hold right now must understand is that right now is a most important time. The world must be shown that this is not a short lived pump and dump scam, the way that will happen now is MERCHANT ADOPTION. We have seen an adoption of the currency, but unless it shows itself as something other than people "sticking and moving" by make shit loads and then CONVERTING it back to fiat it will drop considerably. A the entire idea is to move away from fiat, yet if people just use it to gain fiat, reality will soon come crashing down. Bitcoin should be leading the charge  {or some exchanges} for quick and convertible interactions with other cyrptocurrency, to further make it so people can spend there coin money for goods and services. Bitcoin can be the vehicle posterboy that ultimately the exchange is done with, however quick conversions and interchangeablity of other CC to bitcoin so as to base them on the value of bitcoin not fiat. IF large amounts of merchants and service start to use bit and others via bit as an exchange on a broad level, the farther thinking future now needs to be contemplated. That being if bit starts to take over the fiat world, it better start thinking about how it is going to value itself. If bit continues to climb in value, and fiat continues to decline, a coin could reach unheard of value, yet at the same time will have somewhat of a Zimbabwe effect in that the currency it is basing itself on is somewhat valueless, and that bitcoin divisions will be somewhat like Vietnam Dong in that 2,000,000 D will buy you a pack of gum. I suppose really hwat this means is that the sooner you get in, the more likely that if you hold, the value will go up...There will be several ups and downs, several wild cards with the media and potential government intrusion via the central banks, but for now I think they are liking it. Before they had to rely of governments to request loans in order to create money, Now they have a virtual "entity" and market creating the demand for new fiat, so for now this works for them...Please keep in mind that as big as a 13 bil. market cap seems that a guy like George Lucas was worth 3.5 bil at one point and that frankly whales can come in and move things around the way they want. It's goin to be up to YOU as the holders of virtual currency to MAKE merchants get onboard by DEMANDING that they accept coin.

"all digital one world currency" "first you give it away" then you see who comes back for more" "things start out one way, then end up another" "sometimes angels are demons, and demons are angels"
There are two camps in bitcoin, 1. the idealistic youth who see's this as the future and a way to kill central banking. They think this based on what they see, and what they hear, and based off how it started and "who's" in control. 2. And then there's the central bankers, who have all the power in the world and are very clever, and then there are those who very much like their money and would like some.
central bankers would very much like to get rid of consumer banking and all those nasty "strength tests" as well as ditch this entire bond swap bs with the treasury...ALL they care about is extracting their cut.
Bitcoin may be controlled by a program, but all that matters from a central bankers point of view is being able to extract the cut from the humans. 
And this is why you see the helicopter ben, wired{shill mag} and all of this media frenzy and subversive propaganda. They are going to "normalize" it ie. co-opt it. First they give it away, as you see now, then as we see slowly move in. Those of you who are into bitcoin for the right reasons are being used by forces within the bitcoin that are not "nice".
As I have said many times in the past, "there will be money to be made" good for you if you did...but I will make a prediction.
1. Bitcoin for some time will continue to grow, it is being propagandized 
2. As it grows you will see slow co-opting by the central banker controlled government, as we see now
3.as they slowly start to get their hooks into it, it will start to become apparent to the "good bitcoiner" that they got into this is as a "fuck the man and the system" only to find that it has become owned by the man and the system.
When this happens we very well may see many people jump ship. The problem or choice they may have to make is that they are too into it to get out, it will come down to a moral decision. Abandon what you thought was good but now you know is evil, or stay in because you're in too deep and it works too well.
The central bankers are clever and may have other CC waiting in the wings. CC are the way to take central bankers and debt based money down...the question is will one of these cryptocurrency's  be allowed to flourish outside of central bankers control.

perhaps you are unfamiliar with up to the second revaluation...so lets say one second you had 100 usd worth of bit, you hold, based on not being subject to inflationary debt based fiat rules it goes up to 150, you can now spend that, but 50 dollars equivalent MORE with bit, or still save/hold 100 and get 50 bucks for "free"...really your just taking back what the central bank took form you and your ancestors over the last 100 years

but soon the cries of anti Semitism will be hurled, oh, but wait, that's right, I'm a Jew, so F.O Zionist's...incase you people don't know, there is a rather large movement in the Jewish community that seeks to both separate and differentiate themselves from that of Zionist's who are pro central banking, ie. pro debt slavery of people. 
And lets stop pussy footing around, this is about taking the power away from The Rothschild Zionist...either that or transitioning from one form of control to another.
these are very unpredictable times, with very unpredictable outcomes. Everyone knows that government is a division of the central bank as long as they must borrow from said bank, not the other way around.
Bitcoin will yield profits for now, but it very well may be theirs. How it is controlled will be the proof in the pudding. Heck, it could be a movement from the BRICS for all we know.
I say bitcoin is washed out as of right now for the average investor, so the logical thing to do is jump to the next CC and make it go through the roof as well, and then so on and so on...Fuck these criminals. we can just steal there power away by simply not using there crappy debt money, last time I checked, I didn't need the cia,fbi,tsa,nsa,dod,atf,irs and the other 3 letter agencys to live my life ...ANYONE who has made bitcoin money should be IMMEDIATLEY preparing to GET THE FUCK OUT OF THE USA before it's too late...the Ponzi scam is unraveling bitcoin is an in your face litmus test of such things. You have no government, it is a division of the central bank, most unhappless bitcoiners know this....NOW!!! is the time to go if you have made lots...Russia, Brazil, Belize, Uruguay, Paraguay, would welcome your money at a much lower tax rate and embrace the increase in local economies that yor bitcoin money brings...taxes are everywhere, but it is almost a moral thing at this point...why support mass murdering Zionist's? when you can choose a lesser evil.

you do not have a government, you have a division of the central banks...is there anyone here who does not think that money is in charge?...money is not created by the government, money is borrowed by the government. The central banks that are in charge by having the "right" to create money, with debt attached as we all know are made up of the member banks which are in turn made up of all the powerhouse banks that we know and hate, Chase being one {aka monster form Jekyll Island aka Rothschild Zionism.} So in this case instead of the central banks using "government" to crack down on bitcoin. The central banks will use their member banks in the consumer world to make bitcoin not fundable.
AND SO....if bitcoin listens to me, right now, and does what I suggest, we will win. What that is, is that starting pretty fucking immediately bitcoin and all alt coins must be valued in GOLD AND SILVER like now! So the same metric divisions that happen with bicoin must happen with the weight of gold and silver. You can give a spot price listing in "money" if you want, but it has to be based on the gold/silver value first....Bitcoin to gold then to "money"...this way when bitcoin is cashed in, it is cashed in for physical metal or paper stocks first, which then are able to be transferd into dollars...What are the banks going to not accept checks from gold exchanges too? The gold and silver markets will love us and embrace us as the value will skyrocket, making them good investments too, as well as remove metal from their hands, as well as put their balls to the wall and make them have to decide if they will no longer deal in metals because bitcoin is connected to it...WE MUST DO THIS NOW....AN IMEDIATE CHANGE OVER TO BASING THE VALUE IN GOLD,SILVER.PLATNIUM,PALLADIUM....we use the metal as the transfer vehichle....bit, to gold, then to cash....what does Chase no longer want gold too?

Government is a device of the central banks, a division made to seem as the ones in charge, but that is just so people , like yourself, will perceive them as the ones calling the shots...The banks control the media, meduia dictates the election process, the election process dictates the "leaders" these people dictate all policy, including fiscal. There are plenty of historical facts that are put together in many well done documentaries that explain how money as debt works and who is in charge...And it ain't the "state" they just legitimize the scam. Money is in charge of this world, governments do not create the money supplies, the borrow money from private banks owned ultimately by 13 families. The Rothschilds Kuhns, Loebs, Bauers, Oppenhiems, Lazzre, Montefiore, Cohen, Goldschmidt, Stern, Wharburgs and a couple of others who collectively, along with the share holders and board members of their respective banking empires including but not limited to JP Morgan, Citi group, NM Rothschild, Moses Sief, RBS as well as energy companies such as Cheveron and or the Rockefeller standard oil division.
The Fed is the one corporation beside the post service, due to its "quasi" status, that has no compitiotion. They are the sole providers of the USD for the USA. They have no competitors and have one client for their product, the USD, that client is YOU!  and currently, for the services rendered thus far you owe them 205 trillion dollars.
You saw it right in front of your eyes just recently; government is broke{after extracting 28-50% of every working persons pay their entire lives} the debt ceiling is hit, ie the credii card is maxed out, thet argue over how big of extention of credit they will ask VISA ie the fed for a LOAN, after the theatrics, the debt ceiling is raised, ie more money put on a credit card that is already maxed out at the "on the books debt" of a paltry 17 trillion {that YOU owe them, the private for profit bank that creates your money by tapping digits on a screen} So the government did not "make the money" they "borrowed" it from the fed...now when the FED extended this credit, was that done for free? hell no...see the 17-205 trillion dollar debt. Whats that China you say? no China and the rest of the world you owe an additional 600 trillion dollars in iou's ie bonds that you are on the hook for, iou's the same bankers made up in your name.
So I don't think you really understand what is going on. Those who look at "government" as the problem, are doing just what they want, get mad and go after the decoy, the guy named Mugsy sitting in the boss chair. He ain't the boss, anyone can stick a placard on the desk. These guys just make sure you choose one of the predetermined guys they show to you on their media, they control the choices, they control the medium to which you hear about it all, they tell you when to vote, who you can choose from, and who won and when. Truly funny that people don't understand that they are being bilked in a credit scam. Even more funny is that the names of the people listed above arte the same guys that Hitler was trying to stop, that's what WW2 was about stopping these bankers. So isn't that funny, this country has turned into a 1984 easy button fuck show and the economy is trashed because the same guys Hitler was trying to stop used you to stop Hitler and now their fucking you over, hahha, it's perfect really. And even more funny, I'm a Jew

If we are given three n-bit numbers a, b, and N, with the promise that b=a s modN, for some s. The task is to find s. As shown by Shor this can be achieved on a quantum computer in poly(n) time. The fastest known classical algorithm requires time superpolynomial in n. By similar techniques to those in quantum computers can solve the discrete logarithm problem on elliptic curves, thereby breaking elliptic curve cryptography. See also Abelian hidden subgroup.
