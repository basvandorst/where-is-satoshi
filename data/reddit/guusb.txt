Stepping off because of turbulence is a good argument. However they stepped off because they thought the SEC would disapprove of the ETF.
If it's other people's money you still have incentive to make as decent a return as possible. Think about commissions and reputation.

No it's not going up and down. Fiat currencies are jumping around. A bitcoin is a bitcoin and doesn't suffer the endless trending to zero.

Indeed, never risk more than you are willing to lose. 
And that's exactly why you should put it in Bitcoin because putting it in €'s or $'s will definitely make you lose all of it after a while. I'm not trying to be funny or something. I am really serious.

Good point. I added a disclaimer about storage and knowing what you're doing. Thanks.

Just keep all your wealth in bitcoin, and you won't be bothered by prices going up and down. A bitcoin is a bitcoin.

I think Bitcoin, because 1. Strong network effects  2. People are already strongly invested in it, they'll try to make this work. 3. Much development going on right now  4. As Tuur Demeester described in his article "How to position yourself for the rally in Bitcoin", software protocols that are the first one to be invented often become the global standard (TCP, IP, FTP, DSL, DHCP etc.) 
I see no advantages in other cryptocurrencies that are circulating right now. 
I did split one bitcoin into 50% Ether, 50% Dao, for fun.

Thank you for your comment! That's what I'm trying to convey.. 
I accept it as money, and I accept it as gold. 
I hope more people follow. It's time to switch! All of us could switch in one single day. It's only a change in thought.

Thanks :) it was my first post. If you have any feedback I'll be happy to hear it.

Normally you also pay transaction fees on exchanges. And in the case of shorting you have to pay interest rates on the borrowed amount, sometimes.

To have some idea about what the bitcoin will do if the euro 'crashes', I think it would make sense to try to think of some scenario that can happen in order to try to predict from there what it will to do bitcoin. So here we go :p
This might be a possible scenario: first, a few (still toxic asset holding) banks in Italy and Greece collapse because not enough bailout money is secured. This will lead to decreased investor confidence and less trust in the economy as a whole. Stocks may fall a bit, which may lead to a lot of fear and panic selling of stocks. So, stocks then plunge. The ECB then wants to boost the economy and will resort to 'unconventional methods'. It however fails to do so because we are in the liquidity trap (0% is 0%) and people aren't borrowing more to invest/consume more. This would cause the economy to shrink a lot and a lot of people will be made redundant because there is nothing to sell to anyone. The purchasing power of people is therefore diminished and real estate will collapse in value too, because people will not be able to get mortgages without jobs. Other people will be unable to pay off their mortgages and are forced to leave their homes. This will cause the value of real estate to shrink even further. Other banks will collapse too because their assets have shrunk too much in value (the collateral on the mortgages is suddenly half the value). This will keep on going for a while and is self-referencing. Bitcoin may be seen as a safe-haven in times of insecurity and be more accessible than gold may be. So, bitcoin * 20, and real estate &amp; stocks /2. You can now buy with the blood on the streets.

If "at one point 1€ was $1,60", then that doesn't mean that the euro is doing well. Only that the dollar, was at some random point in time cheap relative to the euro. Has a lot to do with international financial markets and interest rates.
And the eurozone is not doing well, at all. ECB is still printing new money, failingly trying to "combat deflation". Banks in Italy and Greece represent a major risk for eurozone stability. Sovereign debt is very large and ever increasing. Higher interest rates will, in the future cause Japan-like crises in the future. The Euro as a currency is a completely failed concept, devoid of reason and triggered by irrational bureaucratical attempts at international integration / cohesion. It really is a terrible idea to impose an additional constraint on a lot of countries with strongly differing economies. The constraint of not being able to change the international exchange rate per country, which worked as a fantastic auto-stabilizing mechanism.. :( Also, countries in the EU have now become dependent on eurozone stability, which is only positive for the lecherous countries. It is however not sustainable in the long run to keep on sending money to those countries if the tax regimes (the faulty systems) are not altered.. Man. The euro is such a failure. It's not even funny anymore. 
What is positive about the euro however, is no more intra-eurozone exchange rate risk. But it doesn't really weigh up to all the negative things.

Good luck! :) I hope for you that your premise (i.e. that the mean line has any predictive value whatsoever) is true. Also, I strongly doubt it. I'd say that the network effect wouldn't cause for a linear value appreciation if more people get to know about it. Rather, exponential value increases would be expectable here. Other factors influencing bitcoin value change strongly over time too.

That's the most silly piece of conspiracy theory I've read over the past few years.

Split doesn't matter as long as you got your private keys. They work on both chains. Best to wait a while after the fork before you start transacting to ensure you have good software at your disposal.

I reasoned the following: if bitcoin had to become a global currency, then to allow enough transactions per second the blocksize would have to be extremely large (if everyone on earth wants to do 2 transactions per day, then we would need blocks of 23 gb (now we can do 7 tx/second, we need 14 bln/(86400) = 162k tx/second). Thus the blocksize has to be 162k/7 times larger (approximately 23 GB) which is (as of yet) a bit unwieldly. So now with core they are trying to find a smart and elegant solution that is scalable. Anyone correct me if I'm wrong or add on to it.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:55:29
Ok, (I'm not trying to be a shithole here) so basically what you're saying is that there are factors that influence the value of bitcoin. I understand that. If you take the beginning of bitcoin until now and you project a mean line (with two data points (beginning until now) you get a linear line. But you mean moving average I guess (with what period - how many days/weeks/months do you take as a period?). &lt;-- This choice has great influence on where the current moving average would be. 
My point was however that neither moving averages nor any other 'trend' has any predictive value. It also does not indicate the true value of bitcoin. It has no meaning. A moving average is merely a simplified representation of price history to facilitate chart interpretation. So if the price falls below a line (which is some function of bitcoin price history that someone came up with), it says nothing. So even if it falls below your mean line there is absolutely no implied reason to despair. There is just nothing connecting the two. Technical Analysis has no meaning.

demand also goes up if prices go up ;) sheeple
@_date: 2016-07-03 13:09:37
Yes I also had economics at school :p. I was emphasizing your secondary effect. If prices go up people think it's gonna keep going up. So it is in some way indeed self referencing, however not infinite.
