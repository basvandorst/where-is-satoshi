You must of been the salty bitch that flagged my post about the huge buy order.
@_date: 2019-06-25 05:33:24
My God you are right. Just jumped over to look and it’s bad.

Just get their US based exchange when it releases.

12.3 has been breached!!

No longer a landslide
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:00:30
You over paid. I got in at $11. So please tell me again how you are a baller.
@_date: 2019-06-27 16:54:15
Kinda realized that when it was to late. I blame my kids for it.

Why the fuck was this flagged when it had to do with Bitcoin ? That’s not general trading.
@_date: 2019-06-26 16:54:30
That slap felt like cotton candy
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:38:33
But this isn’t a bad secret you are keeping. It’s a future investment to make your twilight years the best they can be.

I’ve been holding for a long time now. I don’t own a huge amount but bought in back in the triple digit days. My wife doesn’t even know we own bitcoins. However next year is  our 10 year anniversary. And she is gonna get the honeymoon she never got regardless of the price. The rest will stay nestled away for when the kids are off to college.

If I sell one or two we will still be looking really good for the future. The only time I have ever sold one was a private sale to my dad for what I originally paid for it just because of all the times he has helped me out in life, I thought it was a good way to pay him and my mom back.

Now I’m worried to go to sleep. That I’m actually asleep already and this is a dream and by going to sleep I’ll wake up and the price will be like 8k.

Now do we have any concrete ideas or evidence for what is driving this run? I’ve been trying to research but there is no big consistency. It’s like everybody drew a straw and came up with their own ideas.
@_date: 2019-06-23 21:05:03
So do we hit 12k this week? And if we continue this healthy run with healthy consolidation, what do you guys think happens next year with the halvening?
@_date: 2019-06-25 06:27:51
India is proposing to ban BTC so I think before that’s get voted on a lot of people are buying from their as well as China.

This is not a drill people. We are rising. If you can’t bear to watch. Please duck and cover under your school desk. Again this is not a drill. Bitcoin is launching.

For the non believers we will be serving up a nice array of crow.
@_date: 2019-06-05 20:37:00
You are a humorous pessimist. I like the cut of your jib.
@_date: 2019-06-22 03:18:15
What’s the prediction for how many minutes it takes to reach 11k?
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:35:36
Are you a time traveller? Do you use a Tardis or a Delorian?
@_date: 2019-06-21 02:13:25
I’m gonna bid 9800 within the next hour.
@_date: 2019-05-13 17:31:45
And by just printing the money it devalues the dollar. So it’s not just a matter of printing the money.
@_date: 2019-05-30 21:52:24
So basically you want to centralize and control bitcoin. Gotcha.
@_date: 2019-05-14 22:27:46
I sold off half of my LTC just to have some play money. I have been holding Bitcoin since the triple digit days and don’t plan on selling that nest egg anytime soon.
@_date: 2019-05-13 22:11:53
It’s reached over $8100 on CoinBase.
