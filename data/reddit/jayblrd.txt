And if bitcoin cash is such a great technology it should be able to prove itself on its on, although I see online are Bcash supporters trashing bitcoin and shilling campaigns which almost seem coordinated by a few social media accounts. Not very convincing in of itself.

I do respect every other altcoin except Bcash because their supporters constant bashing of bitcoin, while every other altcoin supporter out there just focuses on what their coin can do differently. That is what I respect.

You CoME off as really defensive about Jamie Dimon. 
"The best bank CEO of our lifetime" ...!?!!??
....are you on the JP Morgan payroll or is Dimon your uncle or something?
@_date: 2017-12-02 05:33:17
I knew you were either so far up Jamie Dimon's ass that you were either paid by him, related to him...ahem or him. Nice to meet you Jamie Dimon. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:53:18
Haha, Bcash isn't even on this....why is it the altcoin to get added onto coinbase again?

If something goes up $1,000 in a few hours chances are it can go down in less. People celebrate on fast gains and then freak out when it dips.

The people investing in Bitcoin because of the futures markets have a large amount of capital, and those watching the BBT can buy 50 bucks on coinbase.Both help but without the futures market we wouldn't be pushing close to 20k

Yeah, just like no one has found a use for a dollar cause we have precious metals, beads, shells and wampum to trade and buy goods. 
This article is a joke.
The internet got its start in the 80's, but its potential wasn't fully realized till much later either...same could be said for credit cards, which this article seems to love.

Sorry to hear this, but only transfer the same type of currency to an address or it will be lost.

It isn't random anti-JP Morgan threads. JP Morgan's CEO Jamie Dimon has come out adamantly against Bitcoin many times and even said if you buy bitcoin you are an idiot. Luckily every time he says that the price shoots up.
I think a lot of people on here probably understand investing a lot more than you think. Especially when it comes to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:59:45
Hey, that's when I was gonna buy more...yeah it will probably dip after I do that. Thanks for the heads up, I'll buy after  then,

You saying there is no financial basis other than its price appreciation lets me know you don't understand the tech or the community. I invest in Bitcoin and other Ventures I believe in, which have strong support from a wide variety of investors; in it for even more diversified reasons.

You could mine some ASIC resistant coins like Vertcoin. I think they are a few other alt-Coins you can mine with GPU. One click miner might be worth checking out.

I bought about 15 bucks or so worth of BTC around the time it took off. Just me and a few other whales making some waves, don’t mind us

In this type of market it never hurts to sit on the sidelines until you see an opportunity you feel comfortable with short term. However, if you’re in it long term has been a good strategy in this market if you’re not wanting to swing trade.

I want to add that Money can be made in a bear market, you just have to work for it, instead of pure dumb luck.

The people that make money trading crypto, spend a lot of time and energy staying up to date to know their trades and the market can change at any moment through whales, manipulation, FUD, or FOMO. We are in a bear market now, so it is even more difficult to trade. The people that thought they were brilliant traders last year, really were just reaping the rewards of a crazy bull run. It can be done but try it with fake trades on an app like Blockfolio first or a small amount you can afford to lose. If you do put in money soon, I would wait for a clear signal or direction of the market in the next week or so.

A lot of traditional markets like energy markets, real estate,  health care, and even the S&amp;P 500 have correlations. If Apple stock is doing well most tech stocks will follow its lead  on average. However sometimes you have an altcoin run and see variations in losses or gains. Nothing too crazy but good to watch for investors.

The RSI is showing oversold on a lot of timeframes. However there are some indications we could go higher, so wait for a dip or by now and hold if it does actually dip. Anyone that says they know for sure doesn’t understand how markets work.

Did the same thing December of 2017, best trade I’ve made in my life. Congratulations and happy for both of you!

Now you have bots trading based on algorithms which influences price some,  but a lot of the price jumps recently are due to technical indicators that traders buy based on the charts.
And then there’s always the whales

I’m not 50/50 but I prefer to have some  balance and diversification , because I’m able to not FOMO or React to FUD as much if I’m watching my crypto go up and stocks go down or vice versa

You have to calculate risk vs reward. I’ve been on coinbase for years and never had a problem. Cashapp you are not able to withdraw bitcoin I believe.
If you can’t withdraw your own bitcoin then it really isn’t yours and  If the  50% gains this month or 10% gains today aren’t worth the risk then a bank sounds more suited for your risk tolerance
@_date: 2018-12-07 12:05:46
That’s where the 30% comes in

It could be the  case that you may have too much of your money in crypto. Cash out a little on this bull move.
If I can’t sleep on an investment I know I’m too invested. You can always set it aside to by more crypto later.

If we fall past 3,200 there’s not a lot of historical support for a while and we could see a flash crash with some real cheap BTC

Charts can’t predict future patterns, but can tell us probabilities of price action with some chart indicators being correct 70-80% of the time. Makes a lot more sense to use  data from technical  anyalsis along with fundamental analysis to have some insight into people’s buying and selling behavior.
