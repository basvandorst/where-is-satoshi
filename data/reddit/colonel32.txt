Fortunately - we aren't all in it for the money - some of us are in it for the social change, and the better future for humanity.
Bit deep for this time in the morning - but for sure it will only get deeper the more Lavazza i sluice down.

Some people bought shares in Google or Apple when they were cents or a few dollars.
They are all squillionaires now.
Bitcoin is the Google Share of Digital Currency

Just observations, nothing personal.
There seems to be a hint of protectionism going on with the complainants. I see a lot of complaints across the forums from 'wealthy' established miners who have lots of GH/s sat in racks at home. Ghash allows everybody to mine a bit, whatever the budget.
That is truly within the ethics of Bitcoin. If you really want to be ethical in trying to prevent the Ghash thing, buy some massive amounts of mining kit, and rent all the GH/s available, out to some little guys who haven't got $3K to lay out out. That is the succesful business model for Ghash.
Just saying.

I Edit the site Badbitcoin.org - We absolutely detest the Bitcoin Foundation. Many of it's members have pride of place on our own site. Not where you should be really.
Great Project - You have our support.

Agree totally. I've just moved 50GH/s from Ghash to BTCGuild.

Welcome to Bitcoin
Before you are tempted to invest it, and double your bitcoin in a day, check Reddit and other forums, and check our Badlist at

FYI. This site is now listed at 
It is another scamsite from Wuxi Yilian LLC
There is no UK Company, this is a chinese scamsite.

It is still profitable to mine, even renting GH/s. What everybody forgets to mention, is that you sell the rented GH/s back when you choose, so no capital is lost. Everything those GH/s earn is profit, however small. 
It is for now, one of the few ways to get a return on your Bitcoin, so it can only become even more popular. Perhaps Bitcoin has to adapt to, and accept this trend. Or find another solution, but what is fair to one group, will inevitably leave another group cold.
The other thing is - when all the coins are mined, there still need to be full nodes for the blockchain. Cex will have a lot of hardware that might be good to migrate to this role.

Excuse the typo - Blockchain, not Blockachain
@_date: 2014-09-02 16:19:08
This is an article about the Blockachain from June 2014 in The Telegraph, and it is the most definitive, and informative article on Bitcoin and the Blockchain to date.
Even if you already know about this stuff, this article is the best yet written.

I'll take a look at this site - it's a new one on us.

Historically, whenever a currency becomes negative, people will trade in any other way, swapping their skills and produce in return for needed skills and produce. That can only be good for Cryptocurrency, and really bad for consumerism.
Bring it on.

Demand for gold, outside it's use in trinkets is for electronics applications, and store of value.
Transporting and warehousing the store of value aspect is so much more expensive and impractical that it makes no sense to continue to use it beyond the near future. There are ships full of it at the bottom of the ocean that failed to deliver it.
As for the electronics demand - graphene and other carbons will make it obsolete. Bitcoin is the Gold for the new economy.
The old economic rules need not apply.

We get a lot of reports from people losing their money and Bitcoin into dodgy mining pools, which is probably why Ghash is so popular, it might cost more, but you aren't handing Bitcoin to a scammer.
There's an old saying.
If you spend too much - you can sometimes lose a little money, but if you spend too little, you can often lose everything.
And all this 51% malarchy. It's only really theoretical, and even if Ghash achieve 51%, rewriting the entire Blockchain just isn't possible now.
Is it me?

That didn't take long. Loads of people have lost Btc to coinfog, for many obscure reasons, but you don't have anybody to complain to - it's the nature of anonymity.
Your gambling when you use any site like this, that they have any reason to be trusted.
@_date: 2014-06-23 11:26:57
What we need is the Bitcoin Foundation, or better still a trusted organisation to take on the role of providing trust to specific  wallets for Bitcoin Businesses.
Honest Traders would have no problem with providing proof of ID and perhaps Bank Details to the Trust provider as it would boost their trade above the untrusted wallets.
The personal information would not need to me made public, except in the event of legal requirement.
Anonymity and Trust in one go.
This would soon weed out the cowboys.
But they seem to be too busy playing with their Mac's and iphones to do much that is useful to Bitcoin - Sigh.

Yes - I do have a great deal of money Invested in it. But that is because I invest wisely and with insight. 30 years in business has enabled me to totally fund Badbitcoin.org for the last year, not for profit, but to clear a path for the good actors, and for the societal change that de-centralised finance will bring about.
Social values that are no doubt abhorrent to many of you, and a complete mystery to many others.
I have seen the medium that can finally bring this about, and it is Paycoin.

Neal is also a member of our own Team, and a top investigator, and he did write that, but not on CCN or as a representative for CCN but citing his own experience of similar false accusation. A case which he recently won.
He is absolutely right, there isn't a single fact in that article, but it has a serious effect on the individual investors as well as GAW, so it needs to be addressed seriously.
I am not so independent in my own opinion, and I am 100% in support of XPY as the only real opportunity at present to achieve mass adoption of cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin is a great store of value, but useless as a currency with hours to confirm a transaction. XPY bridges the gap between the idealistic but improbable anarchic model, and the real world
Oh, and it isn't a scam, ponzi or con. We should know.

The shouting gets louder.
This is because Paycoin is set to put all your scamcoin pump &amp; dump 'Playground Empires' out of business for good.
The shouters all have vested interest in the failure of XPY, in order to sustain their own scamcoins which they pump, dump and destroy the credibility of all Crypto in the process.
Shout all you want scammers. From our perspective, Paycoin is the first NON scamcoin to come along in the last year, and has the potential to finally bring Digital Currency to a mass market.
We have listed 535 crypto scams in 2014. We DO know a scam when we see one, and GAW, and XPY are NOT scams, and so we will keep defending it. We want to see mass uptake of digital currency, after years of stagnation, bitcoin just isn't going to do it, but XPY just might.
You don't need to take our word for it - Just sit back and watch this express train leave the station without you.
