Oh I was going to go to the bank to do the wire. I didn't even think about doing it online. I was hoping they would not charge me the $15 if I went in and talk to them. I need a new bank if yours charges 0 lol.

Is that a vendor or exchange. Guess I could just look. brb

Okay so wiring money sounds expensive as well. My bank charges 15.00 for the wire transfer and then GDAX charges 10 dollars on top of that. So 25.00 to get the money in.  Does that sound about right?

I understand your annoyed response as I hate dumb questions too. But even with your link I honestly cannot find where it says a min or max dollar amount for a wire transfer. I can find them for CC, PayPal, and bank account but not for a wire.

That is what I meant. After buying through the exchange I guess GDAX has an option so that I can export them to my wallet. I gather from you that if I wire to GDAX and buy through the exchange it will be cheaper and faster than buying through Coinbase.

Why did you use your credit card AND a wire transfer? I still don't see the option for wire transfer on Coinbase. I will look again.

Did you set up a second account? I am not super comfortable with giving out the username and password to my main account. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 23:24:39
I don't see that option through Coinbase.

I emailed them but they said it could take several days to get back to me. I was just hoping someone knew the answer before then.

No limit to what? A wire transfer? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 23:55:23
Thank you for your response. How are you transferring the money? How much did it cost you to put 40 in? 
@_date: 2017-08-14 01:13:20
I checked it out. I signed up to see what it was about. I guess I would need to do the wire transfer. Then buy how ever many bitcoins at market price through the trading platform. The I can transfer my balance to a wallet?

Okay I will read up on it this evening. In the meantime I guess I should go ahead and setup another bank account just to use with crypto.
