I actually am a CPA.    
IRS Notice 2014-21:    


A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxable gain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is less
than the adjusted basis of the virtual currency. See Publication 544, Sales and Other Dispositions of Assets, for information about the tax treatment of sales and exchanges, such as whether a loss is deductible.

No, it is designed to deter those customers from banking with them.  BoA does not want those people banking with them.  They want them banking else where. 
@_date: 2018-01-08 13:18:27
No, you are confused and wrong.

One of the worst posts I've ever read. And I love bitcoin.

Id love to know what other investments you can get 2.5% risk-free returns. Longer term US Treasuries?

I thought bitcoiners wanted a decentralized currency? Why would you want the CFPB involved with Coinbase?

This subreddit is so sad now.  
@_date: 2019-07-17 00:06:29
Guess what? The bank disclosed their fees and those people still bank there? They are idiots.
@_date: 2017-12-19 17:29:18
That is real cool for Bitcoin.  Way to spin a negative aspect into a positive aspect.  To the Moon!

Coinbase is not FDIC insured. Coinbase is not a bank.  Coinbase uses an FDIC bank to store your USD dollars in custodial accounts.

The bank likely doesn't want to monitor certain high risk customers because of added costs associated for monitoring them for compliance purposes.  For whatever reason the bank identified this customer as higher risk per their policy and risk tolerance.  The bank is free to make this decision.

Doesn't get more anecdotal than that.
@_date: 2018-05-23 22:36:29
We weren’t arguing about stock prices or returns on assets.  I told you your stories about loss of users was anecdotal and you had no facts to support your position.  The rise in crypto prices being greater than PayPal’s share price has nothing to do with our discussion.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:01:38
All their quarterly earnings reports indicate growth in active users.  Increased numbers every quarter.  I'm not sure where you are getting your facts from.  Sounds like more anecdotal BS.  
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:55:52
Paypal's stock price is up almost 60% over the past year.  Keep laughing. 
@_date: 2018-05-24 14:27:56
You brought it up first.    


  
You can cherry pick any time frame to support what your narrative.  If Paypal is on a downward trend, I'd love you to tell me what Crypto and Bitcoin is on.  It's a stupid discussion because both are up over the long-term.   
If you really think stock price and performance over a 7 month period is an indicator of only a company's growth, I can't help you.  
Here is Paypal's active users on a quarterly basis since 2010 in a Tableau report.

Its basically real-time payments and real-time gross settlement system for JPMC clients.  I'm surprised this didn't exist already at JPMC. This saves JPMC and its clients money and also reduces liquidity risks. Its not trying to compete as a currency. Idiots.

Most people (newcomers at the time) that bought Bitcoin up to $20K last year have lost money.  Those people have learned their lesson and will never buy again.

DCA is a sub-optimal strategy in mature, rational markets in the long run.  Price diversification is an illusion. The longer your DCA period, the more likely you are going to be at a market return, but you are going to have less money getting that return.  DCA is not the secret to your success and retirement.  You are spewing bullshit. 
@_date: 2018-11-23 15:58:04
You can’t compare share price to share price.  It’s called market capitalization. 
@_date: 2018-11-20 13:10:41
Faith in what?  Adoption and use of it? Zero.  There has been little growth and adoption of it as a currency over the last few years. The general public prefer the ease and consumer protections of fiat, current payment systems, and credit cards. Could the price go back up?  As a speculative asset, sure.  But it is equally as probable it doesn't.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:18:26
Why would that make your day?
@_date: 2018-03-29 15:30:07
What worked for you? DCA or investing?  I'm pretty confident lump sum investing would have returned more money than DCA in almost all of those investments.  The OP's success is driven by investing, not DCA.

This guy is talking out of his ass.

You are a gambler, not an investor.

How do you know this?  
@_date: 2018-03-30 13:19:47
Cherry pick a time period that fits your narrative.
@_date: 2018-11-26 21:48:50
You won't.  
@_date: 2018-03-31 13:12:30
LOL.  I’ve never seen the purchasing power of the USD ever pop and move like Bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-03-29 13:17:01


You might as well say, "I have no clue what I am doing."
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:49:47
This is why banks will not allow you to buy Bitcoin with your credit card.
@_date: 2018-04-06 12:26:24
You sound like a fucking liar.
