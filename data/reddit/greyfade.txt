It's not in a vault, though. Usually, it's not even in the bank you deposited it.
Banks leverage their holdings several times over into loans (don't you remember 2008?), and ostensibly, the interest paid on savings accounts is from the interest gathered from those loans. (Though I'm starting to suspect it's just interest on bonds.)
At least, that's the whole idea behind the "Savings and Loan" of yesteryear.
Sticking your money in a vault would be putting paper or coin fiat or bullion or bars under your mattress. And that's emphatically not what an interest-bearing savings account is.

When a news organization introduces a guest or when they're quoting someone, they use the official title and a short description (usually provided by the guest or their organization) of the person.
So this means that either Roger Ver calls *himself* "bitcoin Jesus" and asks the news organization to use that as his title, or his organization or associates call him "bitcoin Jesus" and the news organizations are getting it from them.
That says a great deal about him or his organization, and none of it good.
According to [this article]( it seems he adopted the moniker from the Bitcoin Foundation's chairman. The fact that he has not asked people to stop using the moniker suggests that he both approves of and wishes to perpetuate it. This strikes a lot of people, myself included, as slimy.

The whole reason those laws exist is to strictly regulate businesses like Western Union that might involve themselves in money laundering and other fraudulent activity. Without these laws, there would be no way to prosecute whole categories of behaviors that are extremely detrimental to the economy and society as a whole. That's why these things are illegal: To protect *you* from bad actors.

The major question that I never see satisfactorily addressed when this is brought up is, "What is the incentive, in the absence of a government contract, for a private entity to construct and open a new public road for free use?"
We all agree roads are useful, especially as we have them today, and, in particular, the modern highway systems. But their utility sharply diminishes if they don't extend to "unprofitable" areas or if they are tolled or otherwise limited in access. So what incentive, if any, would encourage private companies to construct roads without the incentive of government contracts?

So you don't want to use a bitcoin-to-fiat exchange service that complies with existing US Federal regulations on financial exchange services? Even if it means that it better helps them provide you the ability to accurately report your bitcoin exchanges to the IRS as you are required to by law if you do business in the US with a US-based exchange?

Or, if you examine the trends of actual power consumption per GH for new hardware, it's easy to see that the current consumption levels will *hold* (or slightly drop as the difficulty rises and new, more efficient hardware is released) for the foreseeable future, accounting for all growth rates.
If you want to complain about cryptocurrencies contributing to power consumption, then **be more honest and complain about scrypt currencies,** which are still dominated by video cards and likely average in the neighborhood of 200-500W per *mega*hash.
Regardless, power use is still dominated by datacenters that run predominately x86-based, power-hungry server hardware; and the whole problem of global warming is being exacerbated by the coal and oil lobbies who do everything possible to discredit and discourage the renewables and nuclear power that would go a long way toward alleviating the problem.

GET requests, with their query string, are stored in the web server access logs.
If there's a load-balancer in the mix, it too stores the GET requests in a log.
The users' browsers store the GET request in history.
The password is easily visible to someone looking over your shoulder. Bonus points: It has a helpful "password=" to draw your eyes to it and make it easier to spot.
There is **zero** excuse for sending passwords by a GET request.

The estimates most people use for power consumption of mining hardware are wildly inaccurate, though. The research you cite is for data centers in general (which do a lot of other things, and not mining), and I would question its neutrality (it's funded by the coal power lobby).
The real power usage of the majority of mining hardware is probably a lot closer to an average 20W per GH/s (a lot less than the usually-cited and wrong 650W per GH), which would put current power usage in the neighborhood of less than 1 GW for all Bitcoin mining operations combined. A far cry from the doomsaying.
**tl;dr:** Bitcoin mining isn't a major contribution to the problem.

Indeed, but I imagine there are still a number of miners still using video cards and FPGAs for Bitcoin mining, and that would push the average up quite a bit. My 20W estimate is a pessimistic napkin calculation.

The first few and last few characters in the transaction ID are generally going to be just as unique as the middle of the transaction ID.
This is because the entire transaction ID is so unique that if a new transaction were created every second until the heat death of the universe, it's unlikely that there would ever be one similar enough that the middle was different but the ends weren't.
It's like blacking out all but the first 3 digits of Pi and expecting no one to figure out that 3.14 is Pi.

Apparently it requires using an upgraded wallet that supports SW? That wouldn't show up on an aggregated graph, but *would* show up in an increased number of low-fee transactions that are in the SW format, if I'm understanding the description correctly.
The graph you're looking at is also apparently showing the increase due to a few people using high fees to get prioritized transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-24 20:17:23
Because it requires an updated wallet.
No one who doesn't upgrade their wallet software will see the lower fees, so some proportion of the transactions will not benefit from SegWit.
But *supposedly* (I'm just reading what other people are saying in this post and then google unfamiliar terms) you can get lower transaction fees immediately ***if and only if*** you upgrade your wallet software. The average is going to *hide* that until a *substantial fraction* of transactions are SegWit transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-24 18:53:45


That's what I said.


Please re-read my post. I'm not claiming they're lower. I told you that to get those lower fees ***apparently requires updated wallet software*** and so the lower fees will be attached specifically to transactions that are part of the SegWit section of the block, ***and looking at the average fees hides those numbers.***
