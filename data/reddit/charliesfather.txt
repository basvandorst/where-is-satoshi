This is a good point. Credit card fees here in Canada are between 1.8% to 4% depending on the card. The percentage is slightly higher though when you factor in that they take this percentage on the sales tax portion of the transaction as well. But that is worthy of a whole other conversation!

International transfers is a good point for sure. A bit risky now just because of the swings in price but once it becomes more stable this could be a great use for bitcoin.

I like very much that this is staying a conversation / debate and not getting out of hand. I am actually very interested in bitcoin as it seems a lot of people are.

A worldwide accepted currency without fees would be a good thing. Reminds me of imperial credits or whatever they use in the Star Wars universe. :) 
Basically visa without fees.

You are 100% correct that you are paying for the points when you purchase anything as the retailer is passing the cost along to the consumer. But if you pay cash you are still footing the bill for the people who use credit cards so you might as well join the winning team and use the credit card. I actually believe that points should be against the law on credit cards as it raises the prices on everyday essentials such as food and pampers for people who probably wouldn't even qualify for a card but that is another topic. 
If merchants do provide a discount for using bitcoin I would then have a reason to use it though.
