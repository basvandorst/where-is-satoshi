What if a bad / going rogue country has money now but invests that into crypto in case something happens later on at least the country still has their money that's left in Bitcoin / crypto to help survive.
All it takes is the backing of 2-3 huge countries that think Bitcoin is the best solution as a solid investment knowing someone will always be buying Bitcoin if the price is propped up high.
After the halving there will be 2,625,000 Bitcoin's left. 
There is roughly 8 billion people on earth. With more people getting access to better Internet and more knowledge and may hear about Bitcoin.
This billionaire that just got arrested is going to lose their $77 million dollar mansion.
There are 2,208 billionaires. 
Lets say half of those billionaires will attempt to buy 5,000 Bitcoins over the next few years.
1100*5000 = 5,500,000 Bitcoins bought
Price is going to have to double or triple and that's just looking at billionaires. Not people under a billion dollars in wealth. Hedgefunds. 
You can't do math and get a low number when you think about the world's richest people, countries, companies that manage funds where their total clients funds ends up in the billions and they are ready to buy 5,000 Bitcoins.
It's just a matter of time before Bitcoin breaks $20,000 and we see where the next stop is.

It's interesting to see how bots work. There are at least 4 well programmed bots on Bitmex 
And out of those 4 does a single person control 2 of them. Say a bot that goes only long and a bot that goes only short. 
Wild wild west on Bitmex. Over a trillion USD volume last 365 days. $2,739,726,027 volume a day on average in the last 365 days. 
Pulls in a couple hundred thousands of dollars worth in BTC fees a day. Plus insurance fund.
All Bitcoin goes to exchanges long term through trading fees.

Of course. We go where they move the price. You need money and lots of it on every big exchange to get the price moving.
