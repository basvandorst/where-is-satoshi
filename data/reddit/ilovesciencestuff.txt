I never call anyone I care about stupid. It is a bummer you and your friends do.

He called you stupid, and you are stupid if you continue to call someone who calls you stupid a friend.

Instead of asking, go look him up on YouTube. He has his own channel. Watch and you will see the important work he is doing for Bitcoin awareness. He works his butt off for Bitcoin.

Then I'd be totally be pissed at that altcoin Ver promotes for mooching off their idea.

But if the creator of Bitcoin sued for ripping of the term established in their published whitepaper Bitcoin Cash and other "Bitcoin" projects could be in trouble. Blockchains can remain centralized but the creators of website could still get stifled.

Absolutely agree. Everyone should contact them about this.

Request they remove it here:

Who is that last guy? Is that your uncle or somebody? Tell them to shut up.

Way better than a Lambo. Congrats!

This actually sucks, because I'm sure it is only part of the movie because the characters are criminals. More hollywood bullshit.

You lost my interest at Hosp.

Mr. T has the longest chain.

I wouldn't have went as far as posting on Reddit, but the change is necessary, for sure. Same with all the ethereums. Also same for Bitcoin Gold. These new currencies which "borrow" from existing currencies are unethical.

A friend of mine mentioned doing the same thing on their exchange. They get too many questions about the different versions of Bitcoin. I think they're renaming Bitcoin Gold too. Makes perfect sense. Should I be able to start a new car company and call it Honda Elite or Honda Gold? Of course not. Same with crypto.

When we live in a time where Uncle Gary or Aunt Sue are just barely able to navigate online, cutting down on name confusion is absolutely critical. I wouldn't post about it on Reddit, but I still applaud your decision.

Only available in adult clubs, I presume.

Thanks, I have been out of the loop.

At least look up Synereo's WildSpark project. Maybe then you will not be hesitant.

I really like how hard it is to read the dollar amounts. What a truly inspired and mind-spinning cartoon. May I license it?

She loves you. Treat her right. Have a great one.
