Have you checked Andreas Antonopolous's "Mastering Bitcoin" or   ?
ProfBitcoin is sharing good stuff too!
Keep digging, don't forget to lift your head up now and again, eat, take a bath, sleep a little, love your family, enjoy the adventure!

Looking at the videos, they look very familiar, I think I followed the archives of this course, in early 2016, which had been prepared starting Sept 2014.  I recall being disappointed that I'd be following something that was relatively outdated, and in the end, I was very impressed with how forward thinking the instructors were, that they had correctly predicted many trends which turned out to be true.   If they are updating the course, it sounds interesting to me, but not sure yet if I will take it.  Thanks for the question/reminder, Ill check it out at coursera.

I love free money just like the next guy, but I agree.  I'd run a full node anyways and would recommend that anyone who receives payments do the same, paid by the protocol or not.

Depending on who your peers were... (and maybe who their peers are... and so-on) would this create uncontrollable network concers?  Would your BU peers (or indirect peers) NOT forward your transaction because it looks like a double-spend?

I fell for their marketing in December, 2015.
I followed an ad (don't recall where or what) to earn a free virtual debit card.  I was presented with a vertical list of about 30 social-media tasks to perform spreading the word about e-coin.io; I had to perform 10 of these over a number of days with each one I performed being checked-off along the way.   It included reading articles, watching videos, liking or sharing e-coin.io marketing material.   Nowhere along the journey did I find myself being pressured to shill anything that I felt was dodgy or mis-informative, rather, I found the entire experience to be a well-organized marketing campaign, where I was gently eased into learning lots about e-coin.io and their offerings, with incentives that made me feel confident that others would also take part.
Before I finished the tasks to qualify for a virtual ~~credit~~ card, I decided to create an e-coin.io account and then ordered a physical card (about $18 funded with a bitcoin deposit to an address they gave me).  They ask for a minimum of personal information to be an un-verified member with low-use limits, and offer a path to become a verified member with more reasonable limits.  You can fund your e-coin.io account with a confirmed(1-3) bitcoin transfer (at which time your stored value is dependent on your trust in the centralized e-coin.io), then access your e-coin.io account to transfer value between that bitcoin balance and the currency of your virtual-or-physical card at a known exchange rate that e-coin.io adjusts with the market.  It is my experience that the card is credited and ready to be used within minutes (perhaps immediately); as well, it is my experience that card transactions appear within the e-coin.io history just as quickly.  This cannot be said for my top-notch traditional fiat bank account.
They also allow you to request a bitcoin transfer to an address you provide from your e-coin.io bitcoin balance.  In the first week of March 2016, I experienced a bitcoin confirm within 10 minutes, I don't recall if I paid the fees or if they did.
They have recently changed names and are also offering the reverse functionality of moving funds from your credit card back into bitcoin, imitating an exchange.  I have no experience in this regard, but it sure seems attractive; they're offering all of the tools necessary to use bitcoin today (with others who dont know bitcoin) just as we use a slow trusted fiat-bank account, except they're doing it the way it should be done, online, efficient and immediate.   Further, the fact that I can choose when to transfer between fiat and bitcoin means that having an e-coin account also means I have yet another, very-convenient exchange option for speculating.
I have no idea if I can trust e-coin.io, but I'm doing so with very small balances risked in trusting them.  I do believe that they have a profitable business plan, that they use winning marketing strategies, and that they offer a solution to necessary use-cases for most bitcoin users today; so I do believe that if they can be trusted, they stand a good chance to stick-around longterm.
To sum it up, at this point in time (mid-march 2016),  I do like e-coin.io and plan to continue using my cards and online e-coin.io account.
(edited: not a credit card)

I might as well add my own personal fud to this debate.
Let's assume that the user is also running a 3rd node, one that is crusty-solid and has been listening on the network for years, one that does not support any new features of BTCC nor btcu, one that just works like bitcoin has always been working, because this user does NOT want to play a part in emotional/political/fud that this shit-show has become in the past year. Lets assume (a fair assumption) that this user is simply trying to deal with a reality that they have not chosen, so that they are prepared and capable to take advantage of unforseen opportunities.... or perhaps, this user believes that if everyone is prepared to keep both sides of a fork viable... that their lack of choice to take a side over the years will prove that their old-reliable original node is the safest choice for all to choose until we are, as a community, acting like grown-up reasonable adults all searching for a solution to a common goal, a very beautiful and inspirational goal, which may leave this world better for our kids than our parents left it for us.

While dust-prone, I still like this, it feels like freedom to vote with your dollars, to make a no-fees transaction with an extra output to be reclaimed by the miners one prefers.
Could there exist a multisig address between sets of mining pools who I trust are pro-segwit (in this case at least)?
If you were to fill the miner's output with the same value that would have been fees, then it would be worth their while to mine it given the original fees were appropriate.  Then again maybe you'd have to take into account the extra bytes required to reclaim that dust by the set of miners who will have to regularly sweep and divvy-up all those extra outputs.
It might be interesting if someday users had the power to create transaction that are only valid in a block which is mined with certain version bits.  Bastiat would ask "what is it that we don't see?"
Without future changes, I suppose we could also just pay our favorite politician to reward the miners periodically for behaving the way we ask them too, centralization sucks but being able to vote more frequently feels less sucky.
@_date: 2017-03-31 10:38:43
whether worth the effort or not, I like the possibility and the fact that folks are thinking about how users may gain more influence in how their transactions are mined.

I dont get it... why dont they just fork (block the rest of the swift network) until they can retrieve those funds?   (frustratedly sarcastic: excuse my poor humor this morning).

I'm not against politically charged arguments, or marketing/packaging in a way that will best reach the consumer, but I am against exploitation of children.  I'm not convinced for a second that this is the work of a child, but I do agree she's a good public speaker.  I just find it disingenous; above all, Im against child exploitation of any form, regardless of how noble the argument is. awesome speech though, hats-off to the polished writers behind the scenes.
@_date: 2016-06-27 15:21:25
Please excuse me for having split-hairs on a degree of exploitation that is not relevant and was in no-way meant to pass judgement.   My point is more that the use of a child to pass an adult message, while being effective for reaching sheep might also be questioned when reading between the lines.  Certainly I think her strong argument could fall apart during a question-answer session which is just a matter of time for those with opposing views .  All of it could be mitigated by allowing the child to pursue her passion for public speaking and making it known to her audience that she's representing views also developed by others.  Again, excuse me for sounding negatively judgemental.

You have the freedom to vote with your dollars.  You also have the freedom to share your opinion with others to make your voice louder.  I think that is beautiful and empowering.  Thanks for sharing your opinion.  btw: keep your eyes out on other alternatives, they do exist (localbitcoins, multiple exchanges, offering a competitive discount to be paid in bitcoin).
I'm going to disagree with any advice to unplug/vandalize/sabotage someone elses property because that would be overstepping the implied limits of your freedom, invading someone else's.  I promise my support to you in the future if the tables were turned and someone was suggesting to infringe on your property.

With intent to challenge the belief systems of those around me, I make sure that I sound like "that guy".  On an intro conversation, I pay attention to keep my tone down-to-earth, but I ramp up the abstract rhetoric as I revisit the same subject to keep them questioning what they are sure of.

I like the show.  With all that happens in crypto-currency space, it seems like she puts in lots of effort and makes it digestible.  She makes no bones about her sponsorship and her obsession with competition; I actually believe that her sincere opinion is for classic, regardless of whether or not she's been paid (maybe try sponsoring her?).  The daily decrypt is a worthy daily visit.

I think the question was asked by a rep from south carolina; she seemed to take a 'wait and see' stance, leaving the innovation open to advance for now. EDITED: I only caught that she was responding to 'blockchain technology', the the fed was not studying anything at the moment but is aware that other banks are studying it.  I did not perceive that she was responding to a question regarding any particular existing crypto currencies

I wish I could help but, here's an attempt:
The unpleasantness of the DAO also lead to many lessons learned.  Keep an eye on both Ethereums and don't rule them out.  One might serve your particular case better than the other depending on your requirements.
CounterParty sure seems interesting if having trouble picking which solidity platform is stable/secure/immutable/here-for-the-longterm.
Ah the collision of wet and dry code, I'm not convinced yet that dry is all we may need in the future, as screwy as the legal system is, it is there for a reason, because we're not perfect and our decisions today cannot always be coded so that tomorrow they will represent our intent.  The DAO had a plan with a team of wet coders to interface with the real world; not sure if it worked out but something like it seems necessary to me.
Best of fortunes in your future endeavors.

I respect your opinion, but my thoughts:  The US is very capable and cannot be trusted, as they've already not shown enough constraint in my opinion, they seize whatever domain they want and that is all she wrote.  I'd rather see the capable US worried about dns in the wrong hands so that their incentives are in line with those who appreciate freedom.  Then they'll be back on our side, at least for this issue.  What's the next issue? IDK, but same strategy as far as I'm concerned.
@_date: 2016-09-16 12:42:20

I'm not a big fan of central control, with the US able to seize domains currently, the symptoms I don't like already exist.
I'm looking forward to putting root dns control in the hands of an international body so that when it continues, US interests and incentives will be in line to promote a more decentralized control.   If eggs need to be broken to make an omelette, let's get on with it.

I'm hoping to be able to hodl until its worth a lot more gold than it currently is worth.
Id love someday soon to be able to borrow against my bitcoin in an atomic safe way, like:
Here's a signed transaction for my coin, you can have it in exchange for some of that useless paper and it will be confirmed in the blockchain not before some pre-determined time in the future.  Ill trade it for some of that paper you're holding, and when I pay you back that paper plus some fair interest on time, then the utxo of the timelocked transaction I gave you will already have been spent to another of my addresses; if and only if I don't pay your fiat back on time and with interest will you get my coin.
Maybe Im confused, Im still trying to see how the bitcoin buildout will evolve, but I believe some day that banks will be my bitch and that I will toy with their monopoly money.  ;) wishful thinking.

"There will be lawsuits and blood in that future."
I do not doubt this.
They can take my high value belongings, and the ones I'm renting them from will become their problem.
They can take my tools, but they will not get my ability of fine craftsmanship.
They can take my instruments, but they will not get my ability to create music.
They can take my freedom, as they do, but they will not get the freedom which exists in my mind.
They can take my life, but I already know that the very least of us will lose that in the end.  More importantly, they will not have gotten from me my ability to live and love well; and they shall never have my keys, unless I choose to give them up.
At every step of the way, it will be more expensive to take from me than what can be taken, because our values are not the same; that which they value most is simply a tool to some, with many free alternatives.
Check! it's their move.

As a parent, I'd be interested in who the influence was who introduced him to bitcoin.  If that influence seems ok to you and if you find that he's digging in all by himself, I'd say its a natural reaction to finding something magical; support his learning and using bitcoin with good intent.

I enjoyed listening to some old bitcoinuncensored interviews yesterday, one from a nobel-whatever economist (sounded like it was from late 2015) who slapped around many of my strong bitcoin biases (im still in denial of some of his opinions).
