If I may ask, which bank are you using for the business' bank account, and how difficult was opening the account?
Have you found that particular banks are more willing to maintain an account for an LLC regularly sending and receiving wires/ACHs from Gemini?

Was hoping it would be a bank with a national presence, but I figured this might be the case. Glad you found some bankers who are as open minded and willing to understand your business. Thanks for the intel anyhow, and happy new year!

Hmm. Good insight. Volatility is high for sure with the division in the Bitcoin ecosystem; some miners proceeding with 2X anyways, Bitcoin Gold launching Sunday, and others rushing to Bitcoin Cash today. Not sure what to make of it.
Fundamentally OmiseGo (OMG) is down because the wallet SDK release was delayed from Q4 2017 to Q1 2018. Think they would be in a good spot when that comes through, and they have a good team including Vitalik himself. On the other hand, some weak hands holding the coin who don't understand that Omise (the credit card processing business) is separate from OmiseGO. They're processing payments for 7/11, McDonalds Thailand with credit cards, not crypto right now.

I'm not affiliated with OMG at all, don't get me wrong. Don't even hold any at the moment. 
If anything, as you might have inferred from my username, my favorite altcoin is XMR (Monero) to own (rather than trade) for its anonymous transaction capabilities. It's a relatively stable coin that doesn't make large moves too often, but gradually consolidates and rises on positive developments (like multi-sig, hardware wallet support, and GUI wallet coming out).

Because the value just shot up with capital rushing out of BTC after Segwit2x was cancelled - is that the reason why? Just looking for some alts to hold for a couple months for good return. Looking at OmiseGo (OMG)

That's anyone's guess, haha.
I'm looking to get some BTC to send to Bittrex and trade alts with. Also waiting on verification there, they screwed something up with my middle name and the NetVerify went to manual review. :(

Unrelated question. When using CEX.io, can I avoid the 7% FOK (fill or kill) order fee by using the Trade tab to buy the BTC/USD pair? Does the Trade tab only have a 0.20% fee? Then I can withdraw the BTC to a different wallet right?

**Would not donate to NODEfather's legal fund and do not recommend anybody else to do so.** If you read the court documents, he was charged with "money laundering" for selling Bitcoin to an undercover officer who informed him the USD source of funds were illegal (from a controlled substance federally). He went through with it.
At this point I'm more likely to believe the officer's sworn testimony over an unstable drug user who seems to have a shady past. NODEfather's reviews on LocalBitcoins include accusations of threats and violence. 
The Bitcoin community **should not** be taking up his cause. One should **never go through with a transaction if you are told the funds are the proceeds of a crime.**
[ blocked me on Twitter for posting this article from BitcoinMagazine and sent me a now deleted tweet trying to discredit the reporter as well as myself.

In this [interview video]( Rockcoons makes some **outlandish claims**:
* Claims he was contracted by the US Army and Dubai National Police to teach those organizations about Bitcoin. He also claims to have made (?) &amp; received payments in BTC with the US military. If he was a contractor, why would he be paying his employer?
* Rockcoons argues charges are a conspiracy by the DHS and Secret Service to disrupt his "national security" work with the military. Sounds like a very common refrain used by "tin foil hat" types, or taken out of an action movie story line.
* Says he pays for everything in his daily life with Bitcoin, including rent, food and a personal bodyguard using funds from a Bitpay card or Bitcoin ATMs.
* However, it just so happens he dug a hole in a California forest to store his cold storage Bitcoin, gold, and silver, and that's why he cannot access those assets to pay his lawyer. He says his lawyer is wanting more up front than he can afford without accessing his 10 BTC on exchanges (locked by 2FA on a confiscated phone, which he conveniently neglected to backup).
* Maintains that he spent months camping in the forest while coding his voice-activated Bitcoin wallet and says he burnt through a $50,000 inheritance doing so.
**The entire story is very dubious. Seems to be concocted to persuade well-meaning Bitcoiners to send money to him for his legal fund - which I DO NOT recommend doing.** While I do agree the Feds need to clarify certain things in court such as how a transaction which allegedly happened within California qualifies as "inter-state commerce", Rockcoons is not looking very credible here.
Not saying he is guilty of the charges necessarily, but his plea for a 150-300K legal defense fund paid for by the community is outrageous.
