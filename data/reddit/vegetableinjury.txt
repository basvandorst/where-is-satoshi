Regardless, the greedy will have to look at themselves in the mirror.  Adapt, or die out.

What if I cannot afford a PC or something to run a node on for LN?
I only have a mobile device that I use for everything.  Same goes for my friend.  What are my options?

The other fork will be able to implement lightning, if they really feel like it.  They won't, but they could if they chose to.  However, with Segwit and Lightning, it's impossible to do smart contracts, extension blocks for privacy, 32mb, etc.
So, the other fork can do lightning plus more.

Yep.  Which is also why Bloomberg Intelligence recently reported BTC is going to $900.  It was mean't to be a currency and is heading in the opposite direction.

You are comparing Bitcoin to the real estate crash..?  Oh my.
You fell for the HODL meme.  Has nothing to do with math.  Good luck.

How long did it take you to start a node and open a channel?  How much did it cost to open the channel?

HAHAHA.  For one, it is true.  However, I implore you to look into it deeper and read between the lines.
Let's say the court orders him to sell.  The would require dumping A LOT of Bitcoin.  I wonder what would happen to the price?
People won't be able to point fingers at him for having to sell and possibly affecting the market.  After all, he would just be following an order from the court, ruled by law.
PS - I'm fairly positive he will be able to move those coins to an exchange to sell, which probably means something special.
