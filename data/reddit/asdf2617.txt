BTC dumping 
@_date: 2018-08-03 06:08:59
Aw, how sweet

Oh, come on. You still haven’t said what drives up the price of BTC, but you’re trying to divert that topic by talking about my perception? 
Well it’s simple, so there’s no need to be cryptic. 
If there are more buys at the current rate than sells, BTC goes up.  If there are more sells than buys, BTC goes down.  
So, BTC only really benefits the people who get in  early.  The rest of the people provide fodder, literally paying to inflate other people’s BTC. 
The people who made riches in BTC in real fiat cash (which can pay bills) sold off.  They drove the price down when it was time, because they knew it was a game and it was time to win.

Do you realize that the money to make bitcoin go up in value has to come from somewhere? It is not magical. The people who continue to buy at higher and higher prices drive the price further upwards. 
That is why investors encourage others to buy... it is self-serving.
BTC can go up for a while, but inevitably it will tank again, and the people who bought at the peak will be the most screwed.
It’s fine that it’s a game, to admit that it is a game that is played voluntarily. But I’m sick of the rhetoric behind saying bitcoin is going to give power to the people by decentralizing banks... It’s just a game, with winner and losers, and a lot of confused people in-between.

I’m excited to meet the extraterrestrials who will finally contact humanity to trade for Bitcoin. There are only 21 million coins in the entire universe, but there is gold on other planets.

I think it’s gonna dip more, but who knows 
@_date: 2018-07-27 07:44:58
Venmo then? 
Let’s be real. People buy crypto to flip for a profit. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:59:39
The point of BTC is to buy low and sell high, to make a profit. 
“Idealistic” people aren’t being honest with themselves. It was never more than an elaborate pyramid scheme, fueled by bitterness against modern banks. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 12:29:07
Oh, that was a figure of speech. You clearly can’t read between the lines, this coin is perfect for you. 
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:34:15
Thanks. Personal insults are what people turn to when they have no logical argument.
You’re probably a huge loser in all this trying to make himself feel better lol 
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:07:52
That’d be too obvious. You’ve gotta get people to keep putting money into it, so there keeps being a supply to take. Gotta keep the hope alive, to keep on manipulating the high and lows and turning a slow but steady profit. 
4% profit in a day on 100K is still 4K in a day, just shorting the highs and lows consistently. Not bad for sitting in your pajamas making some clicks, while the HODLers keep losing and go back to work. 
@_date: 2018-07-28 13:20:37
That looks like heroic rhetoric to romanticize a pyramid scheme, but ok 
@_date: 2018-07-27 03:58:40
Only in retaliation. It’s different. 
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:50:23
When the jig is up, the smart people who got in early will pull out quickly, and the people who are idealistic, or even worse bought at the top, will be losers. 
That will be round 2. Good luck.

They called it ‘Woke’
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:45:16
Sold a while ago :) 
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:15:01
Hahah.. you mean those who bought and held when the price was less than it is now were rewarded... but only if they sold for fiat when it was up. What about all the people who bought over 10K and held? They lost big.
@_date: 2018-07-28 05:24:58
I ain’t your bro, man 
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:35:16
Absolutely not 
@_date: 2018-07-26 07:31:28
Yes, much more liberating than an instant PayPal transfer

Defibrillation is shocking the heart to regain a normal rhythm. I’m sorry you don’t know words you try to use... or investment advice.
@_date: 2018-07-27 02:47:27
Yes, just wait for 20K.  The people who got in super early definitely won’t pull out the foundation at some point and send the coin spiraling downwards. That’d be like a pyramid scheme.
