Thanks :)

Yup, and made a pretty good wallet, that's a case on my video.

I think it's just a good wallet for newbs with few advanced options. Politics aside, I am not the bitcoin cash shill, their agenda is awful. But I do like this wallet.

I am not, literally next video that is in the editing process is about eclair mobile wallet :) I am doing my reviews based on the technology and copay is one of those wallets that are easy to use for newbs, but also got other capabilities. It's just a really good wallet.

What's wrong with that one? There is also rawtx wallet, I will make a video about it for the next week.

Thank you, I will look into all of them! Soon I'll create the website with comparisons of all bitcoin than ethereum wallets and I will move to other altcoins. I just want to help people make good choices and bring some tutorial (educational) side to it. Thanks!

Thank you! I am planning to do at least few of mentioned tips in my next video, volume balancing, face lighting (I was adding a ton of whites in post), looking at camera is hard but I am doing my best :D And I got a green screen, but for this video I commited to just do it and not over complicate things :) Thanks for the advice, feedback is always great!

Could you post a link to 1ml with your channel?

It may cause the material would be much more weak :)

No melting point of stainless steel is around 1380 Celsius which is 2 times more than the temperature of burning a jet fuel. But burning it in a jet fuel could make the cryptosteel much weaker and would probably weld the plates together.

That's why you start with Blockchain education from your girlfriend :)
