First of all, in the first movie from TED, the guy who is talking is simplifying the "money" definition. We don't believe in piece of paper. If a stranger will give you a piece of paper with note "This is 1 mln bucks" noone will accept such currency. We all share common believe in reliability of issuer. It can be National Bank of North Korea, but are sharing a "faith", that people who runs such bank won't do hazardous things to us and keep the value of money at stable level.
Such economy is called fiduciary, which comes from Latin word "fides" and means "faith".   
  
Same goes to BTC currency. We believe, that system which runs the issuing of BTC won't do unpredicted things to us and keep the value of money at stable level.   
  
The difference lies only on issuer. BTC is produced w/o central control - that's all. The factor of "faith" is still the same.

The amount of USD, EUR or any other currency is also known.   
  
Difference lies elsewhere.   
  
The value of "real" currency is valued at three rating agency in the World: Fitch, Moody's and Standard &amp; Poor. Their analysts spent around 3-7 minutes on each country to describe their economic situation which defines their currency value and overall rating.   
The BTC is "free for all". Noone knows the current value of currency, and noone is able to tell what trend is coming. While "real" currencies may defend themselves by intervention of central bank, BTC lacks such mechanism, which occurs in very fluent value of currency.   
  
I want to said it clear - while USD or EUR value may be based on their countries economy, the BTC is nothing else as speculation in worst version.

Yeah, just get into more speculation over BTC, because there is no real value behind it. 
Anyway: why don't you exchange shells?

Could someone tell me who they describe as "millennials"? Those born in '90s - '00? Or just 2000?
