Yes it should be called bad law... but, I think they refer to the fact that many non-crimes thought-crimes and alike are often indeed orchestred by gov agencies and sting op

Next question will be "so what if you decide to murder your guest". Some people think that giving us freedom instantly turns everyone to some savage.... well question for them: if we allow bitcoin what if someone pays for assassination with btc, lets demand id for each btc transaction or just ban btc :p ok?
@_date: 2014-05-12 13:48:32
Yeah lets ban bitcoin "for my protection" .... fuck off doing things for someones protection if they do not want to be protected OK?!
This is same with minwage: Everyone who wants minwage can just decline given job if he finds it not payable enough.  But the reverse is sadly not true without going illegal. Minwage simply makes a problem for people who do want such job: then they must work on black/grey market. Your ignorance of this simple fact is sad.

No one says to return to middleages.
Btw 
Tax rate in feudalism was 10% at least in some countries and that was entire taxation. Now you have 50-80%.
There were few laws now you have thousands written each day in EU legislation bodies.
 (vat then income then monopoly state insurance then more tax on fuels, this are numbers for  European Union countries) read adam Smith site institute paper for details
