He seemed to get nervous once he saw the username

Can we build the seasteads now?

says who?
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:40:17
I'm assuming he means first *new* car.

please do this

30 is the new 18. Especially in 2045.

I thought "real" fuel was a funny term given how powering an electric car still requires fuel down the line. 
I do agree with your concerns about privacy issues/software control, but I don't think that concern should be attributed to electric vehicles, but rather the proprietary nature of the industry as it is today. The first personal computers were also walled garden platforms with proprietary hardware and software. As the industry matured, computers became modular and open. The same happened for software, with projects like linux and the many open communication protocols that we use today. I see the same thing happening with electric vehicles. Perhaps in 20 years enthusiasts will be building electric cars the same way we build PCs.

Cryptocurrencies have the potential to eradicate the "tyranny of the majority" paradigm. This "sacrifice made in the name of human progress" mindset is entirely unnecessary and personally I feel it's dangerous. You mention it being used for good and bad, but what is good and bad for society is entirely subjective to an individual. In this case you are alluding to the idea that its good democracy when YOU are the majority and bad democracy when you aren't. In reality it's just a terrible system all around.

What does "real" fuel even mean? Also, some of the higher end tesla models are outperforming most if not all high performance vehicles.

Leadership defeats the purpose of crypto and is the death of this entire project.
@_date: 2017-03-19 19:36:48
Show me a successful horseless carriage in 1886. The entire purpose of Bitcoin/Blockchain tech is to eradicate the need for centralized authority. You are advocating for leadership in a technology that was meant to be leaderless by design.

I remember being furious reading this then, and it makes me just as angry now.

But those are examples of the government being shady, not the people.

I wish I had the ability to regurgitate NYT/WaPo talking points on command.

Right about now would be a good time for a mass exodus to decentralized exchanges.

GNU/Linux days are numbered. Many permissive (MIT/BSD) userland implementations are springing up and will eventually eradicate the cancerous GNU from linux.

This sounds like a tax nightmare currently. How do you people pay your taxes?
@_date: 2016-07-30 01:11:20
CAD and EUR is classifies differently. It isnt subject to capital gains unless you are forex trading.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:55:04
Neat app. Still a shame that something like that is necessary.
@_date: 2016-07-29 16:56:54
Its worse than that because you have to account for capital gains made on bitcoin during every purchase. So if you receive 1 btc at $100/btc, then buy a cup of coffee for $3 at $200/btc, then you will owe capital gains taxes on $1.50 worth (38 cents at 25%) of your coffee. You could try to add that into your purchases, but if bitcoin is fluctuating daily it becomes basically unfeasible.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:56:51
Not opposed in principle, but uncle sam will find a way to get their share, especially as bitcoin becomes more popular.
@_date: 2016-07-29 17:22:36
Not a tax professional but I assume you would pay capital gains on the USD equivalent if you are in the US. The whole idea of using Bitcoin for everyday purchases seems like a nightmare. Bitcoin needs to be classified as a new type of asset with it's own tax rules, because as it currently stands in the US, using it as an everyday currency is unreasonable. 
Essentially you are paying a fee to escape the inflation of the USD.

It's baffling at how well some people can do this...

Is he being ironic?
@_date: 2013-12-23 06:36:32
Thanks for this back and forth. Your constant dodging of providing proof of your claims plus your unwarranted demeanor has been most amusing.
