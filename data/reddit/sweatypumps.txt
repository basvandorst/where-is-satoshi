Don't worry about buying a whole coin dude. Not many people own whole coins.
Download coinbase and you can buy bitcoins from a uk debit card. You enter the amount of £ you have to invest and it works out the amount of bitcoins for you

No worries! Good luck!

I'm pretty sure that you can "sell" the bitcoin back it then puts it into your GBP wallet which you can then withdraw to your bank account. I think you can do it on the coinbase app aswell, but I'd try GDAX it should work out a lot cheaper

I put mine into Bittrex and brought different Alt-coins instead. Technically "free" money, so I took some chances on a few

What are the fees like on GDAX? It uses the same login details as coinbase (same company) but apparently has less fees

What's the best transfer method on localbitcoins?
@_date: 2017-09-08 15:54:44
It looks fantastic, but is it safe?

So I've heard never to use Paypal as withdrawal method. Is it safe to do a bank transfer?
@_date: 2017-09-08 16:11:23
How does that work?

Oh sorry we're you asking about the ATMS? 1 is in BeFries (opposite Waterstones) and the other is in s.v. Newsagents. It's on the sea front, just down from the cinema slightly. 
If you google bitcoin ATMs Brighton their is a website that shows you where they are on a map and other details about the provider and markets etc. 
Currently they are selling bitcoins at £2200+ so expect to pay a premium, but quick cash exchange for bitcoins if needed

I found 2 Bitcoin ATMs here. 1 that let's you withdraw/deposit cash and the other just let's you deposit.
