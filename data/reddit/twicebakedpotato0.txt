That’s because the quality of the service increased so much, your shitcoin isn’t truly worth anything, isn’t backed by anyone, and wastes kilowatts on kilowatts of power updating a fucking ledger.
Also, the dollar has inflated 3 times over since 1980 and hardly any at all since bitcoin has been around.
And if this isnt enough to convince you, public colleges are non profit.

All the staff at a university are inevitably useful, if they weren’t they’d cut them and invest in infrastructure, they’re trying to compete in price with other universities. 
The dollar isn’t backed by anyone? Have you heard of the U.S. fucking government? The point of having it backed is that someone will always accept it for as long as it exists, ensuring that the value of it could never completely crash unless if the entity backing it disappears (and if the U.S. government falls you’ve got bigger problems than getting your bond paid back). 
The U.S. dollar is also backed by the fact that it represents work done, if you see someone carrying $10 you know that someone gave them that for providing a real good or service. Bitcoin, on the other hand, is rewarded to people running a program that updates a god damned ledger, providing no good or service, only wasting power.
The dollar has inflated to 1/3 of its value, you’re right. But that is per dollar, and that doesn’t mean shit when the money supply has increased by 9 times, meaning the real value of the US dollar has actually increased 3x in value. Meanwhile, bitcoin will never increase supply, it is strictly limited to 21 million coins. As the demand for a fad goes up and supply sits still, price skyrockets.
