Eventually you will have large corporations buying out some of these pools and shutting them down. Its just a matter of when and not if.

the real problem here is when china targets the miners. thats the real problem because so much hash rate is concentrated in China. it will take time to compensate for that should china decide to shutdown mining.don't throw out your hardware mining equipment.
@_date: 2017-09-14 17:27:32
most of the hashrate comes out of China. So yes you would have some serious problems until Miners outside of China can compensate for this drop in hashrate. Btw don't throw out all the old Bitcoin Mining equipment. It may have some use.

Reality 101. Yes we need them to succeed. All these players carry power and influence. We need them to influence legislatures and gain political decisions that are more in favor of Bitcoin. In order to gain greater mass adoption we need their money to invest in new Bitcoin related businesses that can help broaden mass user adoption. The list goes on and on , but the point is we will need lots and lots of Capital , friends in high places, and major developmental support.

I'm sure Fidelity would be very receptive to a Centralized Blockchain that gives them control and Capacity to meet their business needs. 
@_date: 2015-09-02 16:32:43
They or whoever owns them in the future will be in the
position to buyout other mining operations and pools.
The Pools will then be slowly closed down. They can and will
have the capability to control a significant amount of hashing power.

keep the Satoshi as the smallest fraction of a bitcoin that can be sent and keep the finite limit of bitcoins. Make the blocksize unlimited. Thus keeping supply intact and demand untapped.

@_date: 2015-09-14 01:05:09
surprise surprise. This was already brought up here about 3 months ago.  Unfortunately with the Coinwallet Stress Test the other Altcoin businesses will use the results as a casestudy when they pitch their own blockchain to Fidelity, Citibank ,etc etc.

@_date: 2015-03-02 19:10:06
if you brought the shares in a Scottrade or Etrade  Roth IRA for example,  you would shield the capital gains from any taxes. If you brought the bitcoins in an exchange like coinbase and sold them you would be liable for capital gains taxes in the same year.

Coinosphere- Can they at least offer a cryptographically-proven way that other banks will know without a doubt that they cannot be hacked or stolen from on this blockchain? Again, no. Using a permissioned chain creates points of human weakness that bitcoin doesn't have. One Rouge admin or hacker impersonating him can do far more damage that can be done now! (Since transactions are irreversible on blockchains.)

Many on this board claim that it will be possible in the future to assign properties to each Satoshi. And in doing so it could actually drive up the price of each Satoshi since the numbers of Satoshi are not infinite. These Satoshi that have programs embedded in them would also demand a higher transaction fee.

its a hard concept to grasp for many. A radical and revolutionary concept to grasp. And there are not enough programmers out there who are knowledgeable about the blockchain. For example took a refresher class in C++ last semester. No one in the entire class of 40 knew what bitcoin was or what the blockchain was. I think we are still in the early stages of this revolution.

Most of the resistance i've gotten is from people in their 20s.  There is a lot of 20 somethings out there who think bitcoin is a very stupid idea. A lot of your early adopters were over the age of 50 which would currently put them at 60 and over.
