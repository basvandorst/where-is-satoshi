I am not that kind of a guy
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:52:45
you can still file a claim. 
there are two lawsuits going on
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:17:11
right man...I learnt my lesson again...hopefully last time
@_date: 2018-01-17 23:15:49
I hope so...
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:33:47
Can somebody tell me how to-
1. Download full btc blockchain
2. Check balance of multiple addresses (say 250) using downloaded blockchain?
@_date: 2018-01-13 03:31:05
good luck brother!! I am kind of long term investor. I don't change positions often
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:05:44
I don't always do day trading but seems current falling prices of btc, I thought I could sell and then buy later more btc with same money. I sold and then I got scared when prices of btc started going upward temporarily. I lost few btc. never again day trading . I'll stay HODLer no matter what
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:38:53
Anybody making serious money day trading crypto?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:56:04
why market always goes up as soon as I sell...WHYYYYYY? It's green now
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:16:54
yes, it sucks man...I won't do day trade ever. I lost in 2014 when I started day trading and I said to myself....never day trading again. I am a long term investor so I should stick to what I do. but this fall of prices is enticing but..it's a no for me now
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:49:19
no man..don't do this. I am already suffering due to loss of my btc
@_date: 2018-01-14 00:04:55
thanks. but how will I then check multiple wallet balance? Is there a commmand or UI option for that?
@_date: 2018-01-07 17:35:43
i see. i think only few make money day trading. it's  tough. when I invested in btc in 2013, i lost 3 btc in few days day trading
@_date: 2018-01-07 00:00:13


like 1k per day profit
@_date: 2018-01-19 03:10:39
I am worried that i'll lose backup key
@_date: 2018-01-19 02:01:46
Guys, How secure is having avast antivirus on your computer when you are having few bitcoins in desktop wallet for daily use?
@_date: 2018-01-17 22:49:35


I am missing 20% part
@_date: 2018-01-13 00:49:52
but day trading means grazing on charts all day...right? I think it's tough
@_date: 2017-12-31 22:09:01


hehehe....you need to go back in time and invest in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:20:40
thanks for help. I'll check history. Today, my 3 confirmations took around 1 hour after transaction was sent to blockchain. but since, my transaction was only for 9 dollars, did GDAX pay fee on my behalf and lost money?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:02:02
thanks for info. How do I see timestamp on block which included my transaction? All I see is Blue button on blockchain.info which currently shows 4 confirmations
Also, is there a way to see time for 3 confirmations for GDAX withdrawal transactions?  I am sure there are 100s of people withdrawing from gdax at any moment, so finding out what is average time for 3 confirmations will help me
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:10:10
good idea. thanks
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:02:22
i don't think they do business accounts
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:09:59
20ish is not huge. But If I'll have one outgoing and one incoming each day, will that be a problem at charles? Which other banks people are using when doing lots of outgoing/incoming wires?
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:49:17
stop giving stupid answers. I want to buy BTC using USD and then sell to get USD. So I need bank account which will also allow me to do wire transfer in/out. get lost if you don't understand question
@_date: 2017-12-03 00:44:48


I just talked to Schwab customer service. she just said "no". we don't support such accounts. may be she don't know enough? Seems like this account is for individuals not business...as per their website
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:50:39
with that much understanding, it's easy going too.
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:49:57
Great. Any minimum account balance it needs?
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:54:18
and do you do lots of incoming and outgoing wires?
@_date: 2018-06-21 09:17:12


@_date: 2018-06-22 07:14:55
right...but how will i sign offline?
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:45:35
erc-20 USDT have low volume and i don't think kraken will give erc-20 usdt. I trade only 3-4 times per month so i want to get usdt off exchange like kraken when not trading. how can I keep it in any hardware wallet or paper wallet or desktop wallet? and can I send it to BTC paper wallet?
@_date: 2018-06-21 17:40:26
but it's online..right? If i download desktop omniwallet, can I just send USDT to bitcoin address?
@_date: 2018-06-21 07:49:22
Is USD kept on exchanges like kraken safe? What if it gets hacked?
@_date: 2018-06-21 20:35:44
but what if someone hacks the wallet server and changes code?
@_date: 2017-07-29 00:20:53
It is suppose to be like kickstarter but for crypto. It will be used for token based fundraising or starting a crowdfunding campaign using crypto
@_date: 2017-07-29 18:30:56
@_date: 2017-07-29 02:03:02
they give some tokens for signup
