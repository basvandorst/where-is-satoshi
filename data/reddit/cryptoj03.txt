Yes, just be prepared and have your money ready to buy. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 02:02:34
thats how you do it
@_date: 2017-12-01 22:24:58
Exactly, smart guy. 
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:53:06
Thanks, I agree. Definite mistake was slipping up and forgetting to dollar cost average and being able to put in increments as the price corrects. Appreciate your words of enlightenment on the reality of things.

Yea, good point. I literally did the opposite of everything I've learned and studied over time to do in this market. A big learning experience and it's good to hear from others  constructive criticism for support and guidance along the way and not just people bashing newcomers who are still getting their feet wet in this space. Thanks ��
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:08:13
I agree
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:15:21
Completely agree, I have a feeling we will see close to 8k next week.
@_date: 2017-11-10 14:36:58
Thank you. Agree, definite mistake was slipping up and not dollar cost averaging and letting cash sit on the side and put more in small increments as it continues to correct over time.

If you got it at 692, theres nothing wrong with taking profits. Surprised you didn't sell around 11k+ earlier today, most were expecting a correction/dip and already selling some at 10k to be safe. If there is a major correction to come like most expect, then you would be better off selling as high as you can while you have the chance of making the most profit, then buying back after a significant dip. Just an opinion though. You could also just HODL and be totally fine longterm.

Thanks, did let my emotion take over even though I told myself I wouldn't as there is always volatility in the market. Appreciate your constructive criticism.

I'm there with you. I decided to take the leap into Crypto finally and I figured this fork would go like most and it would be a good opportunity to get in, earn some free coin, invest in alts, ride all the waves that I've come to see take place around this time etc.
Little did I know that the exact fucking moment I bought, the unthinkable would happen and the fork would be cancelled. Just my fucking luck, and I now know why so many hate these forks, it causes a lot of chaos and division amongst the community. 
I did make a noob mistake of not dollar cost averaging which I knew better to do but it totally slipped my mind when I made the purchase because I was thinking about all my plans for my alt spread, the forked b2x, getting my wallet set up for the fork etc. So I accidentally went all in and transferred it to bittrex so I couldn't just sell off when I heard the news like everybody did. I went ahead and just got out for now at a loss of $600, because at this point that's all I'm willing to take a loss on and I have no idea what is going to happen going forward but excepted a slight correction just not till after the fork. It looks like the correction is happening now so might as well get it out and try to get back in at the bottom maybe and let all the chaos, dust, and fud clear a bit. Oh well, we can just write it off as a capital loss on our taxes. Unfortunately for me this was not a good intro into the space at all, Coinbase was a nightmare dealing with as well. Took me a whole month just to be able to buy and right when I do this happens.. jeeezee.

Around 5k is what I'm aiming for optimistically in a few days. 6-7k more likely 
@_date: 2017-11-10 13:51:50
Lol, yup... :\
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:05:51
I'll hodl for now
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:19:11
In my opinion, there will definitely be a higher drop. What we saw today is nothing compared to what some believe is coming. Even Data Dash believes we will see around 5k soon. I just hope everyone is prepared when it inevitably happens. Although, it could also more than likely just drop around the 6-7k range. We shall see...

JackCoin coming soon confirmed!

Whale traders who want to make money on the way down, usually amounts to nothing more than a bull trap when it shoots back up that fast after such a drastic drop. If you are disciplined you can swim successfully with the whales on those waves, but just be careful putting in money in times like this, because people may go in as the price rises fast like that, but it could easily go way lower and those people could be holding a bag for a bit.
