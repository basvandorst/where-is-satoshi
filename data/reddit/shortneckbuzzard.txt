I'm awake it's at 15k right now and rising. It was at 12k this morning. I'm no expert but probably yes

All jokes aside I expect massive volatility after the CME group opens btc futures within the next few weeks. Meaning the price action will be insane with massive dips and pumps for a long time.

If you're going to do this which I am. I suggest price cost averaging. Meaning buy some today and then some tomorrow then some more a few days later. If you scale in to your purchase like this the cost averages out. To keep it short if it's cheaper tomorrow you wont kick yourself for going all-in today.

Not necessarily "happening". It's just coinbase is the easiest way to obtain 2x without having to use your private key. So user are depositing into coinbase from external wallets and exchanges. It's going to bring attention but could all come crashing down if coinbase gets hacked

I have been told to do this all the time but it makes sense when the price is in a down trend. When the price is in an uptrend it makes sense to buy a lot all at once. Don't stress to much in the end bitcoin is a good long term hold. Also if you don't have much to spend you don't want to do this because the purchase fees start adding up.

I trade bittrex. If the price of an altcoin drops 50% and bitcoin drops 50 percent my losses double in terms of usd. To much diversity is a bad thing.

It’s implied

Diversify into what might is ask. I am not asking for advice just want to know what you would have done. I am personally not big on diversity

Really it’s up to us as a community to upvote or downvote quality content relevant to bitcoins status. This sub is pretty much useless to me as a btc enthusiast.

Confused by this sub. Always preaching hodl and also promoting spending btc on a sprite at a 7-11...
