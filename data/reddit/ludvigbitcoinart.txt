I don't have any articles; but just look at the world today ;P Its a clusterfuck! 
We have some established frameworks (in the form of regulations, law, ethics, culture, religion) in which we build our economies and societies in, but everything that we build is nothing, but chaos. Millions and billions of people working on different things and things just flow and develop. When we were building our cities in the past, do you think we envisioned the creation of the automobile? No, that is why old European city grids are a complete mess. Do you think our modern cities are built appropriately for *all* future technologies and developments? 
This is how the Internet also developed, there was no grand scheme or grand plan or blueprint of how networks and ISPs and companies and governments and countries and cities, it just happened over time through the combined efforts of millions of participants. There was no predestined goal or roadmap of the development of websites or other services or platforms. It developed out of chaos. I work on global Internet routing, and I can't even begin to describe what a clusterfuck the Internet is ;) 
You think Satoshi had some master plan? To an extent, he had an idea; but he too, also had to change many things in Bitcoin and rework future problems. There is no such thing as omniscience, anyone who tries to convince you of this is a flat-out liar.

The broadcast-based transaction vs unicast-based transaction refers to settlement or transfer of value (Bitcoin), not necessarily communication- but this is also true. You are right in that in traditional data networks, we are transferring bits of information, while in Bitcoin, we are transferring states. 
The premise of the article was to show people how transactions are transmitted and settled in L1 (blockchain) and L2 (lightning) by using analogies or concepts that we may find ourselves more familiar with such as broadcast (one-to-all) and unicast (one-to-one).
1. On Blockchains, a transaction is transmitted and settled or value is successfully transferred when the transaction is included in a newly mined block. The block is then *broadcasted* to the *entire* network. This constitutes a broadcast transmission or settlement.
2. Whereas on Lightning, a transaction is transmitted, settled and successfully transmitted in a point-to-point manner within a lightning channel. Two nodes form a channel and are able to directly communicate and transact between one another and exchange/update states. To me, this resembles a unicast transaction. 
Again, the article was only meant to be an analogy.

Those who were around thousands of years ago had an unfair advantage of access to gold. 
Those who control the issuing of money have an unfair advantage than those who don’t. 
It’s very tricky to use *absolute* statements such as “never” and “100%.” Usually, they are proven wrong in due time. 
Over time, Bitcoin will naturally be disseminated to everyone similarly to how entropy works. Hot energy naturally flows into surrounding colder areas and we continue to see this with Bitcoin. As it becomes more and more adopted, we are seeing it become more and more evenly distributed. 
As a Bitcoin maximalist, I don’t see any room or place for competing currencies in the digital era. There won’t be a euro nor will there be a cryptoeuro.

No. 
I’m suggesting that the OP is antagonizing a very large group of people and is indirectly posing the question of witch hunts against these supposed “bad” people. And if this sort of toxic thinking gains traction, lots of innocent people may get hurt. 
His entire question is based and centered around the idea that Bitcoin was used for illegal or unethical activities which qualifies as a logical fallacy. 
For example: 90% of 100$ US bills have traces of cocaine. Based on this, its wrong of me to assume or question that whoever hands me a 100$ bill qualifies as a cocaine dealer, smuggled or junkie. 
Edit: didn’t realize you were not the OP, sorry. It’s late, heh.

Coins can still flow through by fragmenting and sending them in pieces. To *you* as an end user, you will not see this any of this, but it will be done behind the scenes. This is also a regular occurence in TCP/IP. When you are downloading at 10MB/s, do you think that you are getting a 10MB packet? No, it is getting broken up into many, many, many tiny packets.

I won't bore you the obvious benefits of Bitcoin vs traditional financial systems. If you want to learn the REAL value of Bitcoin, I implore you to watch some of Andreas Antonopolous videos on Youtube.  
Instead, I'll wow you with micro transactions on the Lightning Network is going to be huge. Here test it for yourself:
1. Open two web browsers and put them side by side.
2. Navigate to  on the first browser. Yalls is a newspaper that allows you to pay for an article in BTC.
3. Navigate to  on the second browser. HTLC is a web wallet on Lightning Network.
4. Click on an article on yalls.
5. Copy on Continue Reading. 
6. Copy the Lightning Network invoice hash.
7. Paste it on HTLC and click send.
8. Congratulations! You just witnessed a micro transation for ~0.01 USD. 
Pretty cool right? Instantaneous transactions, across borders, person to person, direct, in any amount, virtually 0% transaction fees. Can you think of any traditional financial platform that allows you to send and receive ~0.01 USD? 
This is all done on the Bitcoin Test Network, and will soon be rolled out in mass scale.

There is no such thing as a mining node anymore. The internal miner was removed in version 0.13. 
Full nodes are what ensure network rules and consensus and also create checks and balances against mining pool operators. Mining pools must create blocks compatible to the rules dictated by the entire network, if they don’t, their block will be rejected and a lot of electricity will have gone to waste. 
This also sounds a lot like r/btc FUD. I’ve heard this exact argument many times before from bcash proponents.

I am trying to paint the picture that the balancing process is automatically working in the background. You route back and forth in both directions simultaneously, fragment the 'packets' even further if you want, you can do 1-2mBTC back and forth and maintain a good amount of liquidity. You don't need to necessarily *wait*. 


No need to get defensive. Lightning can be fail completely or it can succeed. I don't think anyone necessarily knows anything at this point. Based on what I do know about networking though, I see lightning as the best way of scaling Bitcoin and blockchain. Lightning to me is a big mesh router. 
Edit: Edit: And your statement on 50/50 in/out traffic is completely unfounded. I'd love to see any link from any member of the community that echoed that statement. I'm inclined to believe you just misunderstood how payment channels work and are now going into complete contortions to prevent having to admit being wrong. Impressive, actually.
Yes, as our lightning routing algorithms improve over time; we will gravitate to 50/50 inbound/outbound traffic to maintain optimal channel liquidity. Efficiency in any system *can* be improved, but claiming that the entire system is broken because we are unaware of initial efficiency is an incorrect assessment. "DC power is ludicrous, you don't have enough copper in the world to provide electricity to everyone!" And in came AC.

You should start by not confusing Bitcoin Core with Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin Core is the name of the client/suite that was the successor/continuation of the original client developed by Satoshi. 
You mean to say you are working on a new client for the Bitcoin protocol. Hostile forks try to confuse people by referring to Bitcoin as Bitcoin Core. 
And lastly, I wish you the best of luck! I’d recommend just contributing directly to the bitcoin core project rather than fragmenting efforts. But in the spirit of OSS, please by all means, good luck! ��

I'm actually writing an article on Medium right now about how Lightning is more or less the TCP/IP layer to Bitcoin in that it enables Unicast-based transactions to where the Blockchain only supports Broadcast-based transactions. 
And why BCash will fail just like Ethernet Hubs before it.
@_date: 2018-01-01 04:22:46
I love LTC, but lets not spread lies about LTC being 'newer generation' and 'more advanced' than BTC. LTC merely changed the hashing algorithm from SHA256 to Scrypt, decreased block time by 4x, and increased the coin supply by 4x. 
LTC literally pulls all of the upstream commits in the Bitcoin repo and copy pastes it into LTC. LTC is an awesome little brother to BTC, but lets not forget that all of the real, heavy lifting is done in Bitcoin. 
The real truth is that BTC developer base and surrounding infrastructure is simply unmatched. BTC is also the most advanced coin right now, the most optimized and decentralized. 
@_date: 2018-01-22 21:20:55
I see what you're doing. You're assuming that there are no simultaneous reverse transactions being routed through e.g: SOURCE -&gt; C -&gt; B -&gt; A-&gt; DEST. The B-A and B-C channels are continually routing transactions back and forth like a swing. 
Keep in mind, our routers are always performing both INBOUND &amp; OUTBOUND traffic. Lightning nodes will be performing bidirectional transactions, there will be transactions flowing both ways just like we have IP traffic flowing both ways. 
Edit:  - Here's one of my smaller router interfaces with in/out traffic. Lightning is going to be a lot better than how our IP networks work though because its going to be an interconnected mesh meaning in/out traffic will be nearly equal across the entire network whereas IP follows a more distributed (upstream/downstream) design. Unfortunately, IP suffers from dependencies of the physical world and those who control real estate and construction rights of fiber/telephonic lines control that geographic region. But Bitcoin/Lightning is a complete mesh, anyone can peer with whoever they want. While IP may have slightly unbalanced in/out traffic, Lightning will be able to achieve a near optimal balance of 50/50 in/out traffic.

Ethereum and its shitokens are nothing, but a lot of buzz words and baseless hype. 
You should read my article about why multi-layered approach is the proper way to build things out, Ethereum has the wrong idea in building smart contracts in the L1 blockchain; the fact that nobody can actually synchronize the entire ethereum blockchain is proof of this; everyone is forced to resort to 'fast-sync.' Smart contracts are more suited for L3. The base layer of any proper cryptocurrency must be as lean, simple, and robust as possible. Complexity should be built on top of the base layer, not on it.

Not exactly, you can fragment transactions just like you fragment packets. 
A has 50 mBTC
B has 10 mBTC 
C has 10 mBTC
Node A can send Node C 30 mBTC through Node B. The transaction would be broken up to 3x 10mBTC parts or 6x 5mBTC parts. This is done in normal networking too, when you are downloading at 10MB/s, you are not downloading a 10MB packet, but instead millions of packets.

The lightning RFC outlines this specification or practice. It’s a standard of lightning, it’s in all implementations. 
Lightning rollout and development is under way. This isn’t a business to have Q1 or Q2 quarter sprints or fixed roadmaps with project managers and your usual bureaucracy — open protocol development follows a completely different model. 
We first establish protocol standards and specifications in the form of RFCs and then we begin building. Development that follows is chaotic with everyone contributing and building. How do you think the Internet was created? Natural/Chaos. How do you think old cities were created and founded? Natural/Chaos. The development of the automobile? Electrical grids? Telephone lines? Telegraph lines? Do you think a single organization sat down and laid out the blueprints, project plans, schedules, and roadmaps for the development of everything? No. It naturally developed overtime. 
Open platforms and infrastructures follow a different type of development, it’s collectively developed and looks like chaos from the outside. To answer your question, there is no answer to your question because your question is not a correct question to ask.

Blockchain is a great piece of technology, it works wonderfully, it helps us establish consensus and network rules. It provides us with the ability to create true digital assets. At this point, innovation on blockchain is pretty limited from my perspective. We can only optimize it further, which we should continue doing. 
I think the real value now is by continuing to build and focus development on these upper layer (non broadcast-based) networks and frameworks. Unicast is the only *real* approach to scaling digital cryptocurrencies and networks alike. 
I wrote this article to help explain blockchain and lightning by using familiar concepts. I feel that there is simply just too much confusion and disinformation floating around our midst.

3. After a confirmation, you can navigate to the Lightning Testnet3 Explorer and try to connect to some of the nodes: 
4. Click on a node in the right hand tab (they need a public address) and copy the URI ie: 03f113414ebdc6c1fb0f33c99cd5a1d09dd79e7fdf2468cf1fe1af6674361695d2
5. Go to channels, click on create channel. Add an amount (100mBTC) and the channel ID.

@_date: 2018-01-19 22:58:21
We still need to see the public address to verify funds, that's unfortunately just a piece of brass in the eyes of buyers. 
I'd recommend posting it on the collectibles board if you are interested in selling.
I was also thinking about it, as far as selling it for BTC, you may actually fetch a higher BTC premium as the price of BTC is down now. You can look into selling it for BTC and hodling liquid BTC until the price goes back up.

I disagree, a very realistic scenario in our lifetime. 
In 30 years, we saw the world *drastically* change with the advent of the Internet. If you put 1987 and 2017 side by side, they would be completely different world. I think Bitcoin will become a global currency (at least a reserve currency) by 2025-2030, if not sooner.

Are you looking to sell it? 
1. Go on Bitcointalk and register an account.
2. Navigate to 
3. Create a new thread indicating that you are looking to sell; photographs of the coin help.
4. The going rate at the moment is about 1.1+ BTC depending on quality. Is yours a 2011 error coin (you can tell, the hologram should read 'casacius' instead of 'casascius')? If yes, you might be able to fetch 1.2+. 
Some notes:
Use an escrow service to conduct the transaction and have the buyer pay the escrow fees. The best escrow service is run by a person called minerjones on that thread. He basically acts as a trusted third party for the safety/security of both parties. How the escrow works: You ship the item to him and the buyer sends the payment to an escrow address handled by him. He's also a great friend of mine and handles all of my escrows. 
Is yours 
Good luck!

That is not true. The blocksize is no different than a broadcast domain in Ethernet. Increasing the blocksize is similar to increasing the broadcast domain of a LAN segment, eventually you make yourself prone to broadcast storms. Even to this day, us network engineers are extremely careful when spanning our L2 networks. 
If BCash proponents were to re-design the internet using their model, it would be equivalent to putting every single host on the same /0 network. No segmenting. And even worse, they would use old legacy ethernet hubs to achieve this.

If the laymen person cannot meaningfully audit or be certain of the total supply, then the hardness of Bitcoin is negatively impacted. 
This was why gold started to fail; when people were no longer able to be certain of the total supply of gold; and the supply slowly started to inflate via various money substitute instruments.
It is wiser to implement confidential transactions in L2 than the base layer. The base layer is simply a consensus/proof layer for Bitcoin.

The article does not contain factual evidence and is an oversimplification, these are only analogies and are meant to help explain and better understand blockchain and lightning by using concepts that we may be more familiar with. The entire premise of the article is to explain the differences between broadcast and unicast data transmissions and how they apply to the scalability/decentralization of Bitcoin. 
Bitcoin's blockchain (L1) would be equivalent to the data-link layer (L2).
Bitcoin's lightning (L2) would be equivalent to the network and transport layer (L3/L4). 
I believe applications and protocols will be created on the lightning layer.

You still haven’t made a compelling argument why we should not increase the number of nodes. Your argument that “it’s not as good as x” is not valid. It’s like telling someone to stop working out because they will never be as strong as Olympian weightlifters.

We didn't understand the ramifications of increasing big blocks too well back then. The thing about innovation is that it does not discriminate against new ideas and it never stops. People are able to change their minds about things based on new evidence. 
Increasing big blocks essentially means that nodes would start dropping like flies due to something similar to that of a broadcast storm. 
The problem is that most people do not necessarily understand how the blockchain works. It works very similarly to how ethernet functions, or basic switching. In basic switching, when we send a packet out with an unknown destination, it is flooded to every interface on the switch. As a result traffic gets amplified by the number of connected devices. This is why we don't span our broadcast domains or L2 networks too big. It becomes a risk of inadvertently causing DoS attacks and utterly destroying nodes. This is why network engineers try to segment broadcast domains via routing as much as possible across large campuses. 
When you are sending a transaction, you are broadcasting to every other node connected to the network. The way I see the block size, in my opinion, is the equivalent of the broadcast domain. If we are to perform ALL transactions on the blockchain, it would be the equivalent of putting the entire internet (4.3 billion IPs) in 1 LAN network; absolutely impossible! The entire system would self implode instantly, everyone would get knocked off. 
Lightning Network on the other hand, I see it as the equivalent of L3 routing. It builds bridges and is able to route directly between two parties, this is how the internet was able to scale. I'd recommend reading up on unicast, multicast, and broadcast traffic. 
As a network engineer, I am quite convinced that BCash will self implode at some point if it manages to stay relevant and around until then. 
I hope this helps and sorry if my thoughts are unclear, I am typing on my phone which I tend to hate! :P Also please excuse me for any typos.
Merry Christmas!

Nodes validate incoming transactions and blocks and enforce network rules. They act as a check and balance against miners. 
It also helps decentralize the Bitcoin network and makes it more difficult for hostile takeovers. Imagine if we are down to 20 nodes, it will be very easy for a hostile takeover of the network and a chance in network rules to increase the coin supply from 21M to 30M for example. On the other hand, if there are 100K nodes, you would have to take over 100K nodes to change rules. 
Back in 2013, we had 100K+ listening nodes running at one point. We are down to 11K today.

Thank you, I am glad that you found it educational. 
We are even conservative in L3 routing. For example, in the global BGP routing tables, we have a limit of /24 prefixes. We don’t allow people to advertise /25+ prefixes to the global routing tables. The current number of IPv4 routes is about 660K routes. 
If we allowed /29 prefixes to be added to the route tables, we would risk lots of edge and border routers would run out of memory and cause widespread network outages on the internet. I’ve seen a border routers go down, it is absolutely not fun! And it’s not just as simple as adding more hardware as BCash proponents suggest... in the networking case, what if it’s an older router in a poor country. Do we just force them off the internet because their router can’t handle the growth of the tables. No. 
When engineers advise against something, they have reason. 
We all want low fees, and it pains all of us; but the matter of fact is we want to keep bitcoin decentralized. If the layer 1 of Bitcoin becomes centralized and is taken over, we all lose the single most important thing.. the proof of the underlying coins. The idea behind Bitcoin is decentralization and censorship resistant.

You tried to send your BTC to a Bitcoin address which was provided to you by the Electrum client, correct? (By the way, before I continue; I just want to ask, you did backup your Electrum seed correct?)
But anyways, if you open the transaction in Coinbase, it should have a 'txid' (Transaction ID), it is a very long cryptographic hash that looks like this: "dc158df77dadb6c378a15651a3a54d0424f968ed84b80a1b2e5816df563c8b9c"

I agree, long scale makes more sense is far better. 
The article is in English, so decided to use short scale for the target audience. 
The best way to understand long scale is as follows: 
If the number ends in -lion, the prefix suggests power of the base unit (million).
(Mil)lion = Million^1 (Mi or 1)
(Bi)lion = Million^2 (Bi or 2)
(Tri)lion = Million^3  (Tri or 3)
(Quadri)lion = Million^4 (Quad or 4) 
If the number ends in -iard, the suffix suggests thousand of each respective base unit. 
Milli(ard) = Thousand Million
Billi(ard) = Thousand Billion
Trilli(ard) = Thousand Trillion
Quadrilli(ard) = Thousand Quadrillion

@_date: 2017-12-19 06:09:43
Of course.
LN will scale Bitcoin's main chain in the same way paper notes were able to scale gold hundreds of years ago. The only difference is that LN satoshis will have a cryptographic 1:1 map to Bitcoin main chain satoshis meaning you can't fabricate LN satoshis in the way that banks were able to run fractional gold reserves.
LN is like the paper-note layer of gold for BTC, only far better as it can't fabricated because it is cryptographically proven. 
The main chain must remain as decentralized as possible, this is by far the most important thing in Bitcoin right now. The main chain is our FINAL proof of what a Bitcoin is; if it becomes centralized, everything is lost.

Bitcoin Nodes help run network rules and consensus, they also act as series of checks and balances against miners and the new blocks that they mine. 
Also, there is no such thing as a mining node. This is a common lie perpetuated by BCash folk. See:
Removal of internal miner
As CPU mining has been useless for a long time, the internal miner has been removed in this release, and replaced with a simpler implementation for the test framework.
The overall result of this is that setgenerate RPC call has been removed, as well as the -gen and -genproclimit command-line options.
For testing, the generate call can still be used to mine a block, and a new RPC call generatetoaddress has been added to mine to a specific address. This works with wallet disabled.

Of course it does, running a node gives you a voice and a vote on network consensus rules. If nobody operated nodes, then the entire system would become more increasingly centralized. We also must think about other vectors of attack. 
Taking down 100K+ nodes is a lot harder than taking down 10K. The matter of fact is Bitcoin is secured both by total hash rate + number of nodes. It is the only chain of its size that has the most number of full nodes, I don't think any other blockchain even remotely comes close.

They like to compare “blockchain technology” to the internet and Bitcoin as some internet giant that is going to get dwarfed by the next big thing. 
They fail to realize that blockchain technology is more like IP and Bitcoin is the Internet. 
Just because you network connect a switches together and set up some IP routing between them, does not mean you recreated the Internet. Just because you took the blockchain recipe and recreated a new coin does not mean you recreated Bitcoin. 
The internet is the internet because of the network effect, it is not IP that is special about the internet but the network.

No, blockchain technology would be IP. 
What makes the Internet the Internet is not IP (even though that's what it is built on), but it's the network effect; it's the countless amount of infrastructure that was put into place over the last few decades, the ISPs, the thousands of services, the millions of websites, the internet giants, hundreds of protocols, etc. 
Anyone can lay out an IP network on their own (and most people do, they run private LAN networks using IP in their homes and offices). Hell, you can extend this IP network to your entire city or state or country; but it will never be the Internet.
Bitcoin is not valuable because of blockchain technology, there are thousands of other clones and forks. Bitcoin is valuable because it has the network effect, it has the trust, it has the infrastructure, it has the companies, it has the services.

Of course it can, the exchange rate is going up yes, but that is due to rapid Bitcoinization. 
When the world is completely Bitcoinized, its value will stabilize at which point people will begin exchanging it for goods and services, e.g. get paid for labor, purchase food, purchase luxuries, pay rent, etc. 
Until then, people can spend and replenish which is what we do. We do a lot of trading (both buying and selling) primarily in the collectibles/art marketplace (link provided below) with Bitcoin, we replenish after each successful purchase.

If the dollar and all other fiat currencies collapse or hyper inflate, then *everyone* will become “millionaires.”
Though at that point, a million dollars would have no value similarly to today how a million Zimbabwe dollars don’t have value. 
Realistically speaking, this world doesn’t have space for both crypto currencies and fiat currencies. One will win. Based on how the internet unfolded, my bet is on crypto.  I am not saying this to spread panic in the world, but rather, so that we understand and mitigate risk. Bitcoin or fiat is going to 0, don’t over invest, but it is probably a good idea to be on both sides. 
This is why it is paramount that we hedge ourselves accordingly for the future, we simply don’t know what the future has in store for us.

Not quite. 
With LN, you can pay anyone on the LN network as long as there is an intermediate route/hop/channel.
If you and I had a channel open together and I had a channel open with Alice; my channel can be used to route your payment to Alice. The LN network becomes a massive mesh network where anyone can pay anyone and route payments to anyone. This is also all done in a trustless manner using cryptographic signatures.

It breaks down everything by series, type, value and verifies their current statuses ie. if the Bitcoin is still intact or if the coin's hologram was peeled. 
I was also able to draw up nice graphs showing trends in creation and rate at which they are destroyed/redeemed. 
Some metrics:
1. 27,995 coins were produced in total (excluding DIY storage bars)
2. 6,085 coins were redeemed at the time of writing this.
3. There are 4 remaining legendary 1000 BTC Casascius coins which are currently some of the most expensive coinage in the world today, and will one day be the most valuable physical coins. 
4. The 3 largest Casascius 'extinction' periods all coincided with the 3 major bubbles (Apr 2013, Nov 2013, and Dec 2017). 
5. The Series/Version 2 500 BTC bar is the only known Casascius Coin to become truly extinct when 1/1 was destroyed in October 2013. 
I'm a *huge* fan of Casascius Coins and think they are absolutely beautiful pieces of art. If you have any questions on the tool or Casascius Coins in general, I'd be more than happy to answer them.

Thank you, the Casascius market is definitely very interesting :)


Oh yeah absolutely, Casascius coins will one day become the most valuable pieces of art/coinage in existence. 


Unfortunately, no. This tool is only able to track the funded coins, and even then, its not 100% accurate; there were a lot of one-off instances and instances where Mike didn't completely follow the address schema ie. the Series 3 1BTC Silver Coins are supposed to start with 1Ag, but some start with 1C I believe.  
Without knowing the addresses of the unfunded coins, there is no way to flag/tag them.

I shared it with my dad and he says thank you and that he is most honored! We’d love to see the final work when it’s completely done and hanged!! ����
@_date: 2018-08-19 09:47:32
Thanks! I think there are 2 explanations:
1. They were gifts, and the recipient decided to cash out or redeem. 
2. They were tests to verify the integrity of the coins.
That's exactly why I wrote the tool, I wanted to see their true scarcity and the frequency/rate in them getting redeemed.

If you are after fiat gains, you are not understanding Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-05-12 20:09:06
They are incorrectly appropriating purchasing power with fiat gains/value. I think what they really care about is purchasing power rather than fiat gains; they are just fixated on the former fiat systems, this will change over time with increased Bitcoin familiarity and ubiquity.

Hey everyone!
I’d like to share the 3rd painting in my dad’s Bitcoin Collection with you. This one is inspired by the continued, ongoing developments of the lightning network.
I just wanted to extend our thanks to everyone for all of the positive feedback on the first two paintings, it is greatly appreciated! I will include links to the first two paintings in case you missed them. Ludvig Manukyan has taken a strong interest in Bitcoin and he has since started painting Bitcoin-inspired themes. Through allegories and symbolism, Ludvig aims to depict and capture the political, economic, and sociocultural changes in the Bitcoin movement. 
1. The Bitcoin Bull: 
2. The Snowball Effect: 
Please be sure to also visit our website where we provide free high resolution digital scans, we encourage everyone to download the hi-res digital scans:  
**Name:** Snowball Effect
**Artist:** Ludvig Manukyan
**Size:** 24” x 36”
**Surface:** Primed Canvas
**Medium:** Acrylic 
**Dated:** May 5, 2018
**Statement from the Artist:** A thunderous, lightning storm violently approaches a field of blooming tulips—when lightning strikes Bitcoin.
We are looking forward to all feedback, and thank you all for your support!
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:09:51
Oh wow! Offended!? Not at all, that is amazing and looks great! I'll share this with him when I get home from work today, I am certain he will be most honored. :)
Very nice gift :D 
@_date: 2018-05-09 04:45:18
Yes it is. 
Its meant to humor the, "Bitcoins are just tulip bubble," narrative that is so often immaturely thwarted around in mainstream media. We are also very confident that the rapidly growing Lightning Network which we feel will completely debunk these tulip bubble narratives once and for all.

Bitcoin was in a huge bear market at the time. And by bear market, I mean there was a lot of FUD and *real* panic. There was a lot of uncertainty on the future of Bitcoin. A lot of infighting within the community. The market order books were tiny back then, little liquidity. There wasn't a lot of good content or resources with very few experts (knowledgable people) to listen or turn to. The bear market of 2013/14 - 2017 was *really* rough. This bear market (while it sucks) is a lot easier compared to what people endured back then. 
Slaying of the bear whale was a great victory for Bitcoin and is part of Bitcoin history now. 
Here is an article:

Why not? Remove ads, add micropayments. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:28:52
Good question. 
You can perform an unlimited amount of transactions from inside your LN channel for as long as you have it open meaning. This applies to everyone; individuals, businesses, exchanges, etc. 
It will offload 99.9% of transactions off the main chain.
Example: Exchanges will have lightning channels in between them. When you and 100K people send BTC from one exchange to another, it will all be done inside a single LN channel rather than populate the main blockchain with 100K transactions.

Pfft! Charmander &gt; * 
@_date: 2018-06-16 21:37:11
I was able to pick Charmander as our starter pokemon :D I'm going to copy paste my tweets here, CBA to retype them. The following are metrics collected from my experience:
I made 84 transactions in 30 minutes, not a single hiccup. I  used pre-existing channels that I had open. 
Tx Amount: 84 transactions 
Tx Size: 100 sats per tx
Tx Fees: 1.01 sats per tx.
Total: 8400 sats transacted, 84.84 sats in fees.
Shortest time delta between tx/input was 9s; this was because I knew the subsequent input from childhood memory, so was able to quickly execute the next input. 
I'm going to look to script the payment process for faster tx/inputs. Its awful scanning the QR code with my phone!
In comparison, this same experience would have taken *at least* 840 minutes or 14 hours due to 10-min block settlements on  and would incur between ~12600-21000 sats in fees.
Ergh... and to further compare it to CC's: assuming 0.35 USD per tx it would have cost 29.40 USD to make these 84 transactions (valued at ~0.01 USD each).

Hi everyone,
I am resharing this, I posted this a few days ago, but it quickly got buried and lost due to the weekend craziness associated with BTC/BCH. 
After receiving a lot of positive feedback in the first painting (The Bitcoin Bull), I am pleased to announce the 2nd installment to my father's Bitcoin Collection. Ludvig Manukyan has taken a strong interest in Bitcoin and he has since started painting Bitcoin-inspired themes. Through allegories and symbolism, Ludvig aims to depict and capture the political, economic, and sociocultural changes in the ongoing social revolution toward cryptocurrencies. Below you will find his second painting which is named, "The Snowball Effect." 
Please be sure to also visit our website where you can find high resolution digital scans, we encourage everyone to download the hi-res digital scans: 
**Name:** The Snowball Effect
**Artist:** Ludvig Manukyan
**Size:** 24” x 36”
**Surface:** Primed Canvas
**Medium:** Acrylic 
**Dated:** November 7, 2017
**Statement from the Artist:** A dramatic scene of a seemingly unstoppable snowball aggressively rolling down a mountainside. The snowball aims to capture the growth and disruptive nature of the Bitcoin network and its underlying technology. 
We are looking forward to all feedback, and thank you all for your support!

Wrong and poor attitude. You realize Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies opens you up to a global market. You can work for them or create things for them.

What about this one? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:54:20
Yes but we're not talking about it being a bubble or not. That is an entirely different topic. You were suggesting that it has no utility and no value; and it just being an outright pyramid scheme. It appears to me that your arguments/frustrations are not well thought out. 
Bitcoin may be in a bubble right now, and yes a lot of new investment is pouring in due to speculation. You should also keep in mind that it is not a mature market yet, and it doesn't have liquidity saturation; which explain the wide upward/downward swings. The market fair value does not justify your claims that it has no utility and no value. 
You are receiving a lot of backlash from this community primarily due to your extreme viewpoints; if you recollect your thoughts and represent them, I'm sure many would love to participate in a healthy discussion with you. 
@_date: 2017-11-13 08:51:48
It depends on how much BTC you currently own and whether you want to make the investment or (~100$). But I can't recommend purchasing a Trezor enough. It is simply one of the best and most secure ways of owning, storing, and spending BTC.

Research and do your due diligence before actually doing anything in this space. I can't stress this enough, not just you; but everyone reading this. 
Don't be reckless. You have the world's information at your fingertips (the internet), and you refused to take 30 minutes out of your day to do a few Google searches and read through these forums for tips/best practices/do's and don'ts. 
You "think" it was called Bitcoin Wallet? You "basically" just "typed" bitcoin wallet into the app search bar. The one that looked the "simplest?" And... you didn't backup. 
So many bad decisions, and I really don't mean to be harsh. I just want you to understand the severity of the situation, though I take it you already do understand from your big mishap. 
Really sorry man for your loss. Please learn and research now. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 20:40:32
No you are absolutely correct, I saw that post too. But what point are you trying to make? 
There are buyers and sellers in all free markets, everyone assesses their own risks. Are you suggesting that each time a stock, or currency, or asset class, or piece of real estate drops in price or someone sells that it has 0 value or it's a pyramid scheme? 
Your point is moot, an anecdotal reference at best, to justify an extremist viewpoint that Bitcoin has 0 value or utility. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:08:23
Central banks. They print too much, we take them,  and we dump them for BTC. 
@_date: 2017-11-22 18:25:35
Because blocks are what create network consensus and build the official ledger. 
In your example, what if (my node) I disagree with you (your node) on a specific transaction? 
Edit: (I believe you deleted your comment)
I'll explain. 
Think of nodes and miners as our digital accountants, they build and record our globally shared accounting ledger (Bitcoin). 
Your transaction can be located/contained in 1 of 2 places when it hits the network. A) mempool B) block.
The mempool can be seen as a rough worksheet or ledger that accountants use to record transactions and do their work before moving it to the master ledger. This is where your transaction first gets recorded. The problem here is that there is no consensus across the network, some nodes may have records of some transactions and others may have others for any number of reasons. These are unconfirmed or unofficial transactions. 
Moving onto blocks, blocks make up the official or master accounting ledger. Miners can be seen lead accountants who have the power to move transactions from the mempool (worksheet) to the block (master). They do this via proof of work, rather than trust. The goal of blocks is to create network consensus, in order for you to participate in our network and ledger; you must agree to the chain of blocks by verifying/confirming the hashes. By verifying and agreeing to our blockchain, you agree to every single transaction that has occurred on the network and thus network consensus is born! 
This is a very simple explanation. But if you want a good resource check out this video:

Those who fear competition or perceive others as a threat are more likely to partake in attacks. 
I like competition in this sphere as it a) ensures a series of checks and balances on one another. b) ensures decentralization in development. c) encourages innovation. 
Attacks, FUD, and propaganda from both sides are bad and harmful as it takes away from our real work in developing, building, and creating. Its very easy to destroy something, but always magnitudes harder to create it.

No you didn't. 
What's your Bitcointalk handle? What were the faucet websites you used? How much were payouts? Do you have any tx records from the faucets? Where was bitcoin-qt software distributed from at that time frame? 
I'm only asking because for one I don't believe you and secondly you sound largely ignorant and clueless. And you're using argument from authority and argument from age fallacies. 
You say you've been in this space since the beginning even before many of the core devs. You say you are a software engineer who happens to work on blockchain technology, whatever that means. Then you say Bitcoin has absolutely no value whatsoever. ��

People who instead of spending their respective fiat currencies directly, they spend BTC, and immediately replenish. 
Same effect, except you stimulate the economy and ecosystem, and drive up acceptance, ultimately the value.

Another way to approach this is to let the blockchain decide the winner. 
1. Have people select a 2 digit hexadecimal number ie. FF, 1A, C0, D3, 47. 
2. Select a random block in the future. 
3. The last two characters of the block hash decides the winner. 
This will only limit to you 256 numbers, instead of 1000 though. Good luck to everyone! 
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:41:19
Does Jaxx allow you to set a customise the fee? If not, does it allow you to export keys so that you can migrate them to another wallet software? 
We use a Trezor /w a Segwit address, and set the fee between 10-50 sat/B. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:40:26
Yes, but neither is Bitcoin; and it won't be completely mined until 2140; and who knows, maybe gold becomes outmined before Bitcoin ;) 
The reality is that people will and are taking better care of their Bitcoin after realizing the value behind it. It is not everyday that people lose Bitcoin, yes it happens and it will happen; but these digital numbers *have* value, and people take more care nowadays than they did back in 2009 through 2011. 
Edit: I have never 'lost' a Satoshi.

I've seen forums and subreddits go down in quality via memes, one subreddit was definitely r/atheism. While in 2009, it was a good, insightful place for philosophical discussion; by 2011, it became a dreadful, dead place with 95% of the posts being memes. 
While memes are fun and lighthearted and should remain, we must take care to not repeat similar mistakes. It is about finding balance in insightful posts, original content and memes/humor. These qualities all equally help determines a quality subreddit.

Hi everyone,
After receiving a lot of positive feedback in the first painting (The Bitcoin Bull), I am pleased to announce the 2nd installment to my father's Bitcoin Collection. Ludvig Manukyan has taken a strong interest in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies and he has since started painting Bitcoin-inspired themes. Through allegories and symbolism, Ludvig aims to depict and capture the political, economic, and sociocultural changes in the ongoing social revolution and paradigm shift toward cryptocurrencies. Below you will find his second painting which is named, "The Snowball Effect." 
Please be sure to also visit our website where you can find high resolution digital scans: 
**Name:** The Snowball Effect
**Artist:** Ludvig Manukyan
**Size:** 24” x 36”
**Surface:** Primed Canvas
**Medium:** Acrylic 
**Dated:** November 7, 2017
**Statement from the Artist:** A dramatic scene of a seemingly unstoppable snowball aggressively rolling down a mountainside. The snowball aims to capture the growth and disruptive nature of the Bitcoin network and its underlying technology. 
We are looking forward to all feedback, and thank you all for your support! 
@_date: 2017-11-17 10:26:37
Each painting has its theme, this one is disruption. It is meant to portray a fast and chaotic scene. I don't think there has ever been a large technological revolution without any social or economic resistance. 
As far as the other values you mentioned, there are other paintings planned in his collection.
@_date: 2017-11-13 09:43:49
It's actually really not, it's a video of a person who's trying to convince himself that the decision he made was the right one over a 15 minute rant video. Its filled with lots of assumptions, one-sided half truths, and baseless FUD. 
A good explanation would be an unbiased explanation of Bitcoin's and Bitcoin Cash's ideas and approach on scaling. It would explain the pros and cons of each camp's approach.

I don't think it's necessarily to hurt or harm anyone or any industry, but to depict that Bitcoin is here and coming. The men are from all industries and business interests, both public and private. They are being engulfed by this snowball and are tumbling down the mountainside with it.
All new inventions and technological breakthroughs tend to disrupt social, cultural and economic patterns and norms. 
@_date: 2017-11-21 07:15:15
How does gold handle the natural loss of gold? It becomes more scarce and more valuable for others. 
As far as bitcoins becoming burnt, it happens and it will always happen; but keep in mind Bitcoin is just a digital number, a construct; if we need to, we can simply add an additional decimal or two or three, or however many we need. 
Bitcoins getting burned over time isn't nearly as much of a problem as governments endlessly printing fiat. How many countries are currently exhibiting hyperinflation right now? How many in the past 100 years? How many countries go through debt crisis every decade? How many countries exhibit economic instability as a result of poor monetary control? How many times do we have to sing the same old song? 
On the last point: In X amount of years, humans will cease to exist, the universe will cease to exist, etc,

The valuation of BTC in fiat refers to its purchasing power. The more hard core hodlers here are only measuring current and future purchasing power of BTC, I don’t think many of them have any plans to sell for actual fiat.

Lightning is very early software and the network is in its infancy. As a result, there aren't many channels open with a capacity of ~600$ worth of Bitcoin (50-100 mBTC). This is why it will require a directly connected channel with us, over time, as the network matures, it will not. 
We also do still support regular Bitcoin (over blockchain) payments through our BTCPay server which I still expect a bulk or all of our current sales to go through. 
Keep in mind that Bitcoin has 9 years of development, user interfaces, and infrastructure. Lightning has a few months at most. It will get there. Bitcoin was just as clunky 9 years ago. The only difference between blockchain and lightning payments is that the former has 9 years of development. Lightning is absolutely critical to network scaling though. I apologize but I also really don't feel like getting into a long drawn out debate judging from your username. It's not worth either of our time :P
@_date: 2018-03-11 11:11:52
In value and purchasing power:
0.1 BTC in 2018 = 1 BTC in 2014
0.1 BTC in 2018 = 10 BTC in 2013
0.1 BTC in 2018 = 28 BTC in 2012
0.1 BTC in 2018 = 850 BTC in 2011
0.1 BTC in 2018 = 200K BTC in 2010
@_date: 2018-03-07 09:22:07
Bitcoin is a neutral, open currency, it doesn't care about our petty politics. 
Bitcoin flows anywhere and everywhere. It doesn't discriminate, money should not discriminate. When money discriminates, it stops being money. The age of political, national money is over; we are returning to a neutral money like Gold. 
This is actually positive for Bitcoin as it opens up more markets to flow into and Russians as it opens up Bitcoin to Russian citizens, businesses and tech industry. Petty politics does not apply in this new world, there is only objective truths: the blockchain.

Original owner is he who carries the private key to 1Ludvig2k3jYhLYqnwZscJMabniviM7KgM. 
When/if the painting gets acquired by a new party, the BTC stored in UTXO:1Ludvig2k3jYhLYqnwZscJMabniviM7KgM is transferred to the new owner's address. 
The final/last UTXO of the chain originating from 1Ludvig2k3jYhLYqnwZscJMabniviM7KgM is the owner. 
Each painting is also physically signed with a generated P2PKH vanity address (original address) in chronological order of release date, ie. 1Ludvig1, 1Ludvig2, 1Ludvig3, 1Ludvig9..

Communists might view or define as the blockchain (or access to it) as a communal or “people’s” system where all people have equal access to *public* information.

Build a Bitcoin business on the side. Start an e-commerce store. Provide Bitcoin consulting or tutoring. 
You would be surprised at the amount of opportunities that are available! The best part of running a Bitcoin business is that it acts as a weird hedge to Bitcoin itself as downswings in price/value becomes just as attractive as upswings. When the price drops, you earn more BTC due to the lower exchange rate ;)

Blockchains have become quite boring to me now as of late; there is nothing special in any new database (blockchain) that gets built. Congratulations, you built a database, now what? Where is the decentralization, where are the checks and balances, where is division of power, where is the neutrality, where is the global network effect? - Nonexistent. There will never be another Bitcoin. 
Instead, I'm more excited about Lightning. Here is quick write up I did on Medium that helps explain where we are headed. I hope this puts it into perspective.
To conclude, blockchains are boring as shit. Layer 2+ solutions is the next chapter and natural evolution of Bitcoin.

The same can be said about any stock or equity or piece of real estate. If everyone sold at the same time, the price will plummet. If everyone went to pull out their money from their bank accounts at the same time, banks will go bust. 


If this is one of their 'big' arguments against Bitcoin not being a 'viable' investment, then I'm not really impressed. Not bad at all for Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:51:28
The software is in earlier stages of development (alpha) meaning bugs and quirks are still being worked on. 
The software is *usable*, but risky in the sense that unforeseen bugs can arise which can result in loss of real funds and money. Therefore, developers and community members encourage everyone to play and test on Bitcoin’s testnet until the software matures more. 
There are guides on the internet in how you can set up lightning on mainnet, but disclaimer: you can lose your real Bitcoin. So tread with caution. 
I provided links to wallets and resources in this thread (sorry I’m on my phone) so everyone can play and test it out on testnet.

0 confirmations are and were never really safe. Tx's must be included in a block for them to 'settle.'
Lightning enables instant irreversible settlement. This is why this is the future.

The one thing I can say from our experience so far is that being your own payment processor is truly one of the most liberating things. Therefore, we will be donating 100% of the first purchase through Lightning to LN development teams and ongoing efforts. 
On that note, I am also very happy happy to share our experiences, set up, resources, and answer all questions related to Lightning to the best of my ability. Education and the sharing of knowledge is always the most important thing.

Okay. I really don't feel like having a drawn out back-and-forth debate that's been rehashed a thousand times, but I'll respond to this. 
The matter of fact is that blockchains suck. They are absolutely terrible communication mediums and highly inefficient databases. Frankly, they are one of the most inefficient systems because they only support broadcast data transmission by design. There is no reason to have a thousand different fragmented blockchains. 
The focus should be geared towards layer 2 solutions with continued optimization in the base layer. The base layer and unit of any blockchain should remain as simple as possible. And we should build upwards, not continue cranking out these flat, shitty systems with no utility one after another. We should look to more efficient data transmissions, specifically unicast-based.
Smart contract platforms.. Ethereum? The blockchain whose dataset is so ballooned due to carelessness to the point that basically nobody can synchronize a full-node anymore? Ethereum is the best example of what happens when you try to do too much in the base layer. Here is one my friends who is trying to synchronize Ethereum for the past 9-10 months, he just reached recently finally the block height that featured the launch of Crypto Kitties. I don't think he's ever going to be able to fully synchronize. The matter of fact is that those 'token' platforms built their smart contract systems in the wrong layer, they built it directly into the blockchain layer (broadcast) when it should have been built in the Lightning or other L2 layers (unicast). 
Dash or Monero? While I absolutely respect Monero. You realize that Bitcoin devs are slowly working to integrate privacy features into Bitcoin's base layer. In the meantime, Lightning itself also offers a plethora of privacy features built in. 
Blockchains are mainly good at one thing, creating digital assets and achieving consensus. Smart contracts, privacy, and applications should be built on the layers above. Here is one of my articles that explains this in an easy-to-read manner. 
So, yes there is only 1 coin that matters. Bitcoin is simply too large and too technically advanced for any other coin to supersede it.  It carries with it the best developers and ethos. It is the only one that has stood the test of time to basically *everything*. Everyone eventually gravitates towards Bitcoin just like everyone gravitates towards the Internet.

There is no 3rd party (in the sense of counterparty risk) and there is zero trust associated with any route or hop in LN. LN is a routing network that enables direct peer-to-peer transactions by every node facilitating and routing transactions to their adjacent neighbors. 
I'm sorry but if you've been told that there is counterparty risk, you have probably been lied to or mislead.

Yes, they don't.


It actually does, I'd like to redirect you to the tragedy of the commons dilemma: 
In shared ecosystems, it is required of all of its participants to be good stewards of shared resources and optimize accordingly, in this case, block size. Another great example in computing is the memory footprint of global BGP routing tables, ie. the number of routes that is shared between all global routers that carry full routing tables. By not being good stewards and not optimizing, we spoil the shared resource for all and harm the ecosystem -- in Bitcoin this means Bitcoin nodes are squeezed out from participating hurting censorship resistance and in the greater Internet, networks disconnecting from the internet due to routers failing from OOM (out of memory) events.
Luckily, the Bitcoin blockchain has built in protections against this, specifically transaction fees. Those who don't optimize (adopt segwit, batch transactions, optimize transaction sizes) are economically penalized through higher fees. Services and users that adopt sooner are rewarded by paying less for transactions.
The selling point of Segwit wasn't exactly optionality, but rather that it gave each service or user their respective required time to upgrade to the new protocol. Networks adhere to the law of inertia, larger networks have more inertia and take longer to adopt/change hence we stick to soft-forks to smoothen out the process.
Segwit will eventually replace the old P2PKH/P2SH schema. But it is absolutely important that we understand the tragedy of the commons dilemma as we continue to build out this new global network. 
@_date: 2018-03-12 18:18:25
Of course, agreed. But Rome was not built in a day. Things have to start somewhere. 
Large-scale social, cultural and economic changes take time to develop. The transition from the feudal to Industrial age took some 200 years to develop around the world. The industrial to digital era is ongoing for the past 50 years. 
Just look at the development of the Internet itself and how long it took to flow in and completely change our daily lives and the world. It went from a largely niche ecosystem to a ubiquitous network of 4 billion people. It went from a largely clunky and frankly shitty experience to the largest market and communication system. 
Your viewpoints are ignorant and premature, I’m sorry. I commend you for being a conservative and safe investor, and not being reckless like some people today. Scams an snake oil is plenty in any great undertaking. 
People can learn a thing or two from you, but to simplistically paint it as just gambling is plain wrong. The bitcoin community, at least, is pretty technology oriented and driven, the other spaces in this ecosystem (altcoins, ICOs, and ethereum) are an absolute madhouse. I don’t think they resemble Bitcoin in any way shape or form.

Does it? What about all the M2 supply; do we "really" know how much "money" is really out there? 
I think it's completely the opposite, we can actually analyze the available coin supply and how much BTC is moving around on a per-day, per-week, per-month, per-year, per-5-year period; we can actually analyze everything in Bitcoin because its publicly available. We can't do the same with proprietary fiat systems.

People need to remember that these are actual protocols and networks being built out and we are witnessing it in real time. Over time, user interfaces will be developed and will blanket over everything that goes on behind the scenes. 
Similarly to the Internet, I can guarantee you that a little over 99% people of the people on the planet do not have a single clue how the Internet works at its core; but everyone uses it, because it has great user interfaces. I work on global Internet (IPv4/IPv6 BGP) routing tables, and I still have no how idea fiber cables work, it's entirely magic to me :p. Humans are just too damn great at dumbing down really complex things to the point we create specializations. Think about it.. how does a radio work or your refrigerator or your CPU or your car, an airplane, banking, trains, modern factories, lithium ion batteries, city-wide sanitation systems, medicine, etc. 
The one that always amuses me is when people proclaim that LN is overcomplicated, as if Bitcoin itself is not complicated. The only difference in 'complexity' in Bitcoin and LN is that Bitcoin has been around for 9 years and we have a slightly-better understanding of it. :)

Here is a write up I did recently on Bitcoin being a 'natural money' that is backed by absolute energy. Economics to me is the transfer of energy. Bitcoin (like gold) reflects stored (or potential energy) that is used to counterbalance all goods and services (utility or kinetic energy).

I wanted to print or write a unique public address on the rear-side of the canvas, and provide the private key on the certificate. But never quite figured out how to prevent the private key from being exposed when the painting was re-sold. I think you solved it, the next buyer would simply move the funds to a new address. 
Now it's just a matter of trying to implement it this time around, or use it for the next painting.

I didn’t watch that because it was too painful the first time around. 
But I take it he tried to compare lightning routing to IP routing. It’s premature to use the centralization of the Internet as a framework to make the claim that lightning would follow in its footsteps and result in Bitcoin in becoming centralized itself. 
The reason for this is that the internet has a dependency on the physical world that is greatly always overlooked, it being layer 1 of the OSI model. The telecommunications industry is more about real estate and land rights than it is about telecommunications. Fiber and copper are run through land and they (companies) who control land rights control the internet. 
The way lightning differs is that it is a logical router rather than a physical one, I can set up a channel with someone from across the world which is far from the case with Internet routing as I would need a direct connection that is dependent on land rights, real estate and geolocation. 
Please note that I’m assuming that this was his argument, I don’t care enough to watch him incoherently ramble on for 2 hours. 
Please excuse me for brevity and typos, typing on my phone.

Zap will store the data in two directories:
Zap (this holds application specific configuration data to Zap): ~/Application Support/ZapDesktop
lnd (this holds blockchain/lightning network related data and configurations): ~/Application Support/lnd 
Lightning wallets are thin clients, they do not synchronize the entire blockchain. I believe they only synchronize block headers. They connect to other full nodes similar to SPV clients.
I just checked the directories on my own Macbook and I see the following:
 
    Application Support melik$ du -sh lnd ZapDesktop/

There is no official launch of LN :p. 
Segwit required an activation (soft fork) on the main blockchain, even Segwit took years of development and debate and infighting. Lightning has everything it needs now. It's already live on mainnet, but the software is still in alpha-grade and therefore not recommended to be used in mainnet. For example, here is the mainnet explorer: 
To really answer your question, everything really follows  Things naturally develop over time in a gradient and not an immediate launch. This is one of the big problems with people and their inability to not comprehend how protocols and technologies work, because they are so accustomed to company product 'launch dates.' Think of how human cities, civilization, electrical grids, trade routes, empires, internet, cars developed; it wasn't a single moment where there *wasn't* and then there *was*, everything follows emergence or chaos. 
Lightning will develop and grow over time just as Bitcoin developed and grew over time. This is also why I hate ICOs, dedicated marketing teams, concept of roadmaps, and pump-dump schemes. 
In short, Lightning is technically here but we do need to wait a bit more longer for the software/protocol to mature a bit more. We can use it now as I have, but it's very risky.

My first attempt failed and didn't go through because one of the routes didn't have enough liquidity to route 680K sats (54.00$), so I had to open a direct channel with Blockstream's store node. However, Please do keep in mind that most of the channels on mainnet have very low liquidity at the current moment because everyone on mainnet is risking *real* money with *alpha-grade* software.

Initially you may be right, but your premise is under the assumption that the network size remains the same which is untrue. Over time as the network grows and grows in size, it creates a feedback loop.
Other vendors see utility in Bitcoin transactions and begin accepting it as well for payment, which means that the vendor I acquired my product from can in turn acquire resources/material/products from their own vendors and it creates a chain reaction. Movement starts somewhere. 
As far as what I am doing right now is quite simple; a. supporting Bitcoin businesses and helping the network. b. putting immediate buy pressure on the market. Win-Win if you ask me.

We are building a global protocol, not a business. If you look at Ver talks, one of his main talking points is “we need to onboard as many people as possible as fast as possible.” For Ver, it makes no difference if Bitcoin fails as a result of poor scaling strategies, as long as he turns a profit; after all there are 1000 other coins.

Nice service :) I like the clean layout. 


Your description of Ethereum (ETH) is misleading. I think that reflects Ethereum Classic (ETC). 
Ethereum (ETH) had the DAO hard fork, countless bugs and security vulnerabilities that led to loss of funds/fraud, AND they are trying to integrate EIP867: 


Ethereum Classic (ETC) is not a clone. It actually carries the censorship resistant/immutable ethos of Ethereum.

It looks like you yourself need to study a bit more too. :-) 
@_date: 2018-02-20 11:26:00
All the 'smart' and 'privacy' features should be built in the correct layers, L2+, where we have more efficient data transmissions. 
Here's Monero for example:
1.4M transactions for a total of 32GB of data. Bitcoin has done 300.5M transactions for a total of 169GB of data. 
I'm not even going to get into the ridiculousness of the state of Etheruem and how their devs are outright lying to their community and perpetuating that 'fast-sync' is safe because nobody can synchronize their chain any longer. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 01:56:26
Yes, I am able to transact with anyone that is connected to the main interconnected network ie. anyone that I have a direct route too. (There are a few smaller private channels set up between other nodes). 
As far as my own transaction, it looks like it didn't get routed through from my first node due to liquidity or channel balance issues. The reason for this is that most of the channels have with very low balances because the software is in alpha-stage and people don't want to risk too much money. My purchase cost me ~680K sats, most channels I noticed are less than ~100K sats.

Insulting someone because they stutter is not criticism, its assholeism. 
Yes, again, I repeat; he came to this realization and simply wanted to share his thoughts. Everyone's on different levels in understanding this new tech. If you don't find value in his video, just go to the next thread. 
Edit: And on that note, he actually poses good questions that *a lot* of people in this space still do not understand or comprehend. It's a slow collective learning process, and I imagine it will take a thousand more scam ICOs to help people understand that Bitcoin is the only one that matters.

Absolutely, you can play on testnet right now. Please stay off mainnet until the software matures a bit more. There is a risk of loss of funds or issues because the codebase is alpha-grade, so please do not stick to testnet. We don't want to exhaust developers' time for tech support. There are lots of GUI applications out right now. See:  
@_date: 2018-02-12 02:24:29
There are 2 bitcoin networks.
Mainnet = The REAL, LIVE Bitcoin Network. This is what Bitcoin is and what we are all trading and using.
Testnet = The TEST, DEV Bitcoin Network. This is where we all break things and test new code, features, bugs, and play around.

Bitcoin is not a monolithic/hive mind society. You’re going to have libertarians, anarchists, cypherpunks, Democrats, Republicans, establishment, conservatives, liberals, socialists, communists, fascists, men, women, racist, sexists, blacks, whites, Asians. Its the *entire* world. 
Foolish of you to have such naive thoughts about the ‘community.’ You should read up on Emergence Theory, it explains how/why Bitcoin works and is growing.

The transaction itself on Lightning took about ~1s. 
Setting up the software, configuring it, setting up the channels, messing up a few times (requiring to close and re-open the channels), took about 10 hours. I tend to be very careful in these things and make sure I know or understand exactly what I'm doing. 
Have you played with Lightning on testnet? I highly advise that you play with it on testnet first. If yes, message me and I can send you information.

Hey everyone, we posted our painting here about a month ago and it was well received by this community. I just wanted to share with you some new developments. We're really excited to announce that our painting can now be found on Cryptogreetings.com. This is a very exciting development as it is just around the time for the holidays! 
Cryptogreetings is a new, upcoming platform that helps make it easy to gift Bitcoin to others, it is designed specifically for people/recipients that may not be all that familiar with how Bitcoin and how it works. It also helps support many popular Crypto artists, we highly recommend that you also take a look at the other collections: 
Happy to answer any questions that may be around :) Thanks guys!
Edit: I'm actually heading out to a concert right now, I'll be back in a few hours. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:38:21
Because it's just not ready yet. :( It is ridden with bugs, I provided links to resources in this thread to test/play with it on testnet. It's the _same_ experience, except no fear of losing anything of value. 
@_date: 2017-09-18 06:28:55
All feedback is well appreciated and will be shared with my dad, and feel free to ask him questions :)

The Bitcoin Bull Final Album: 
*Showcase of a Giclée print example and COA*
Name: The Bitcoin Bull
Series  1 of 2
Artist: Ludvig Manukyan
Size: 24” x 36”
Surface: Primed Canvas
Medium: Acrylic 
Dated: August 23, 2017
Statement from the Artist: To the left we are met with a raging bull preparing for another charge against a large wall. The bull coupled with an upwards-facing, golden Bitcoin symbol that he is seen to be carrying represent the start of a bull market and a rise in the value of Bitcoin. The wall is composed of large rock formations that can be construed as the very blocks that make up Bitcoin. The wall can also be more appropriately interpreted as a market ‘ask’ wall that the bull is hammering down and must overcome. The wall contains hints of green to symbolize the current USD paradigm. The painting also features warmer tones to emphasize on the stresses, frustrations, and uncertainties of the market. 
We are also releasing 21 limited edition copies that are signed and numbered. The copies will feature fine Giclée prints on canvas and will match the original size of 24” x 36”. Each print will be signed by the artist, dated and uniquely numbered. Certificate of authenticity will also be provided with each print. Please note that stretcher bars and frames are not included. If you are interested in reserving or purchasing, please visit our page on Bitcointalk. Those who purchase "The Bitcoin Bull" will have the option of ordering the 2nd of the series, "The Bitcoin Bear" (same number) upon release.
Bitcointalk: 
*Ludvig Manukyan's Bitcoin paintings will always be strictly limited to production runs of 21 copies, in honor of Bitcoin's maximum coin supply. Originals are not for sale. Originals will be stored away and are planned to be donated to museums and art galleries in the future.*
Edit: Per suggestion, we are including a donation address if you would like to donate: **33XVwXWSXiHtSCHePVUygBDccbrKvV8CLz**
Edit  Wow, this got added into to r/all.
Thank you everyone all of the nice feedback!

We refrained from promoting it until we had high quality scans and the prints which we didn't get ahold of until recently. The original post only included poor iPhone camera snaps.

The secret is to replenish BTC with USD upon making a purchase. ;) 
@_date: 2018-02-12 06:00:48
Bitcoin is 'money' in the sense that it works like gold or physical cash. The moment a transaction is made, it is final; the transaction can only be reversed if the recipient of said money agrees. If you walk into a store and buy a candy bar with physical cash, the store-owner has every right to deny your request to return the item. This is actually a VERY important function of money itself. 
The problem with most people is that they have trouble understanding this very concept because of the form of 'electronic' money that they are accustomed to ie. credit card networks, paypal, payment process, banks, etc. Bitcoin is not synonymous with payment processing, it is synonymous with money itself. Bitcoin transactions are the digital equivalent of physically handing gold or cash.
Over time, payment processors like Coinbase/Bitpay will be created to provide protection services for individuals whether it be consumers or producers. But the underlying Bitcoin network does not and should never support such things. 
Bitcoin is money, not a payment processing platform.

@_date: 2017-10-27 20:13:51
I didn't mean anything of it :P.
A better way to look at it, if the USD and all of its counterpart fiat currencies hyperinflate, they will become extremely risky assets to which nobody would feel inclined to sell a cup of coffee, even for 100M USD ;)
@_date: 2018-02-12 08:16:39
Is it really? 
@_date: 2018-02-27 11:43:10
Yep. It’s very difficult to make hard changes to larger systems or networks. Things must be done gradually. 
This is what BCH people do not understand unfortunately. 
@_date: 2018-02-12 03:41:44
1. Because I like to spend and use BTC, I find that to be very valuable in itself. 
2. With LN routing/channels, there is no counterparty risk as a result of great cryptography magic. There is no risk of anyone getting scammed, it is very much a direct transaction from peer to peer. I pasted many great resources that go over these concepts in this thread, search for 'lopp' on this page.  :)
@_date: 2018-03-11 05:07:22

It doesn't work that way, because that would mean 0.026 BTC would be worth a cup of coffee.

Toggle the witness tx flag at the bottom left. Compare witness tx to tx. 
Witness tx / tx = percent of Segwit transactions in a block.  
We’re at 21%, and still have a few percent points to go. I think we might even see 27-30%, maybe a bit ambitious but we’ll see.

He was the first person to contribute, test, and dev Bitcoin after Satoshi.
But more importantly; Finney was the first person to join the network after Satoshi thus creating a \*network\*. 
@_date: 2017-10-20 20:15:16
You should check out Crypto Greetings :). It is similar to gift cards and Hallmark cards. Grab a card, personalize it (write your letter/message on the inside), load it with BTC, and share Bitcoin and Art.
Founded by the same guys behind the 'Friends of Satoshi' group. It is designed to be simple and easy for people unfamiliar to cryptocurrencies and how they work. It also helps support Crypto artists at the same time.
Our paintings/artworks will also soon be featured and available for purchase on this platform too!

 "The Bitcoin Bear" to highlight the struggles of the growth of Bitcoin. 
He also does have many other ideas though, that are more geared towards the technology and philosophy of Bitcoin.

Bitcoin is not a payment platform. 
It is up to consumers, stores, merchants, merchant solutions, payment processors to assess risk management, insurance, and their public relations. 
E.g. brick and mortar is not obligated to honor a refund, but they do so to gain trust and become more favorable within their community. 
In your example, the solution is quite simple; Etsy can hold funds in escrow and wait for confirmation from Shipping company before releasing funds to the merchant. This is already what platforms such as Paypal/Etsy do today. 
Bitcoin is digital money, nothing more. Everything else is built on top. 
@_date: 2018-02-11 13:45:54

The Lightning protocol is a new, overlay network that is being built on top of the Bitcoin protocol. 
It enables instant, 'unicast' payments using a routed protocol vs Bitcoin's flood/broadcast communication method. It is one of the biggest developments within the Bitcoin space currently, and is one of the best proposals for the future of Bitcoin scaling.

RTL is a great project, I’m very familiar with it. It’s a full web interface to interact with your node. 
Yes, lndash is intended to be a public-facing, read-only visualization and monitoring tool. It will only support a limited set of functions, exclusively read-only.
@_date: 2018-12-31 05:22:27
I started this project to better understand the internals of lightning network and generate metrics for my node to share with friends. Please note that it is still a work in progress, and it is currently *not* optimized for mobile browsing.
Code is open sourced and can be found here:  I'm also not a software dev, so code is quite terrible and mediocre at best. It's written in Python and is a simple Flask application. The application interfaces exclusively with lnd's gRPC interface and relies on no third-party database.
Features (so far):
* Peer/Channel Visualization
* Event (routed payments) Visualization
* Looking Glass service for route querying
