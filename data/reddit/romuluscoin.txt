Some thoughts about socializing the losses for just a part of the wallets (BTC and BTC/USD marging stuff).
To the first, my btc coins seem to be untouched from the hacker. None of them is moved away the last days. So everything should be fine. My coins are there.
I have in pricipal no problem socialzing the losses, but to take the losses only from untouched BTC wallets and the margin stuff is just purely unfair in my point of view.
Why is it unfair?
If the hacker had stolen ALL btc on bitfinex, all losses would have been socialized for all wallets (maybe insolvence, all in one pot, ETH, LTC, BTC, USD) i guess. 
The compensation for robbed btc wallets would be much higher (because all wallets amounts are for socializing -&gt; much more value) than if compensation just takes place from the untouched btc wallets. And this definitly is unfair.
If the hacker would have robbed all btc wallets, i propablay get a higher compensation than if the hacker stole a bit less (current state).
So in the end i would have more compensated btc if the hacker would have stolen all btc. 
You see? Theres is something wrong in cutting only btc users.
What would you have done if just 1 ETH or LTC would have been additionally stolen? In that case all LTC and ETH wallets would have compensate in your logic all empty wallets.
Please thing about it. Great job zanetacket anyway for keeping us up to date!

Step 1: 1.0 "haircut" btc is forced to be converted to 604 bfx (1bfx = 1$).
Step 2: btc price rises to 1208 $
Step 3: I want to sell my bfx.
1.0 btc or 0.5 btc?
My problem is, i had 1.0 btc haircut, but if btc price rises, i  will get much less than 1 btc. so a loss again? i just want back what i had before, with bfx coins i will not be able i think.
