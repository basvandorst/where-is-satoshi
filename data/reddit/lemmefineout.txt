It's obviously an adult film.  The male is playing Mr. Big Banks and you know what he wants to do to Ms. Bitcoin...

“But I got an order book of $2675 and I’m waiting for it to fill”.

How will BTC price respond?

I might buy an Apple Watch just for this purpose.

Totally geeked out on Mr. Robot when I heard Bitcoin is a big part of it.
