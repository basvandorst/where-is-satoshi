Sure! So you can use the app (As others already do) to save related news articles and websites and anything else you can think of. Keep track of anything related to bitcoin in the app, even add tags to organize what you save :)

Me and my team go through the apps content to make sure theres no pornographic or explicit content :D
I personally wouldn't recommend saving a private key because it is possible for me and my team to see it. When you make your content private other users cannot see it but the devs can to make sure what you save is in line with out TOS.

Not necessarily but it could be. Figgle is what you make of it, if you want to make it a place where you store your crypto news you can do so :)

I know it doesn’t directly have to do with bitcoin but I just felt a lot of people here would find it pretty useful. I’m sorry if I annoyed anyone with this post I just don’t have much extra money for paid ads :(

I’m sorry if I bothered you :(
It’s just I don’t have much extra money for paid ads and I spent a lot of time on this project. Plus I feel this app could be really beneficial to a lot of people here :)

So it's not directly related but I do have a few users using the app for crypto currency purposes so I thought some people here might find it useful. They use the app to basically keep news, documents, and other stuff in one place. You can also use tags on the app to organize the outside content you save and you have the option of making what you save private.

Super relevant! Your telling me place to store investment article, data, etc isn’t relevant
Plus people use the app for that so it is helpful :D

Yea I kinda get that, still you can use it to save articles on bitcoin or something that may effect bitcoin, you know to read later; keep it all in one place. Maybe even throw in some motivational quotes into Figgle to keep your spirits up! My dads an investor so i kinda know how stressful it could get. :)
Edit: Stock Broker not investor, I dont even think investor is a real job title lol

Thanks for your support friend! Hope you and others on the sub find the app useful :)

Oh I see, transactions need to wait before getting confirmed or nothing happens. Also another quick question, is more people purchasing bitcoin the reason for its increase in value compared to the dollar?
