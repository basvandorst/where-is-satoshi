Or it could be Satoshi making himself a billionaire. Has anybody looked at the age of the coins being sold?

Lets say that the US converted to bitcoin tomorrow, from USD. That would mean that 30K users would be worth a trillion dollars? That's *just* to get bitcoin into circulation in the US. Where does the absorbed wealth come from? It's another form of usury. A deflationary system generates permanent wealth for those with enough money in the system.

It would be nice if there could be more than one block chain, where each block chain would be connected to a domain. That domain would be the keeper of records for the block chain, a central news feed for events that happen to that particular chain. It would keep all the metrics for the chain in plain site so you wouldn't necessarily have to join the chain to find out things like it's transaction power, or how many blocks have been found. The domain could also provide the initial relationship, to fix the 50% problem.
Can anyone explain to me why this is a bad idea, rather than just down voting me?

When that first bubble burst, lots of people got screwed, and many people don't like the absolutely *huge* advantage the early adopters have.

How many blocks have been found? How many people are using bitcoin? How many of those were around for the cpu to gpu mining transition?

You're probably going to get a lot of "this is a feature, not a bug". I think many people are banking on this as the start of transaction fees for fast transactions.

I slightly agree with OP's article, but it's **way less extreme** than the author makes it out to be. Bitcoin really, very much does remove humans from the transaction level, and it makes operating without some form of technology impossible, but, it's only a slight progression beyond how the majority of the world works right now.

1) It's easy.
2) It works for little a while.
3) Lots of other people use it.

Stocks aren't currency and don't pretend to be. I don't think that Bitcoin mass adoption would help the world. I do think that it's a stepping stone towards the way things should be, though.
@_date: 2012-09-23 04:52:01
A few things, mainly the problem with limitation on the number of bitcoins and how they're already distributed.
@_date: 2012-10-04 15:54:34
The existing wealth in bitcoin is far too concentrated. It is a stepping stone as it is paving the way for a better system that may or may not already exist. Mass adoption would hinder the next system from taking hold as fast.

Think about it like land on an alien planet. 30,000 people have already claimed most of the land. Satoshi himself owns a chunk the size of Australia. Do you think 5 billion people are going to want to live there? Why not move to a planet with less claimed territory?
@_date: 2012-09-24 09:11:46
First of all, you're not using the total amount of USD in existence, you're just using the amount in circulation. Paper money is not where the majority of the wealth is stored, and if you want to be able to truely convert to a currency, you have to be able to convert stored wealth as well. Bitcoin doesn't just exist in the US either, use the whole world's wealth as a measure.
You're also comparing the *total* number of bitcoins to the *current* amount of money in circulation. Bitcoin isn't going to finish creating currency till like 2180. How much money is going to be in circulation in 2180 to total number of bitcoins or how many bitcoins there currently are to how much money there is currently in circulation is a better comparison.
The big problem is when you think about who owns bitcoin, collectively, what kind of system bitcoin is, and how the transfer of wealth takes place. I know that, for it's current purposes, bitcoin has enough volume for the immediate future.
@_date: 2012-10-04 10:25:54
No, that's exactly what I'm talking about.
@_date: 2012-10-05 13:18:22
Half of bitcoin is owned by 30K people. Whether the world converts tomorrow or over the next 1000 years, it doesn't make much difference. Satoshi himself is probably sitting on 50k blocks.

This will be solved by dedicated wallet devices. Android and iPhone apps will help too.


If you stuff all your money under your bed, you'd lose that in a robbery too. Bitcoin is a cash replacement, not a bank.

We're almost there. You just have to remember that Bitcoin is still in beta.

You don't get much more money back from them than you spend on them, but if you live in an area with expensive and/or inconsistent electricity, like California or North Eastern US, it might be worth it.

Then how do you know it is at all? Even with only a 10,000 word dictionary, that's still 10,000,000,000,000,000 (10 quadrillion) combinations with 4 words. On top of that, I don't think you can get close to touching a decent set of proper nouns with 10,000 words. All someone would have to do is add a name and you could have the local file and still not find the password with a super computer.

Deflation theory says that when the value of currency starts rising, everyone stops spending and the entire system freezes. Instead, what we'll see is poor people still spending their coin and rich people hording more than ever. The system won't freeze, it'll just generate a huge, ever growing wealth gap.

Except you can only get Raspberry Pi's from one place, and they prefer to sell to education and non-profits. You can't clone a Raspberry Pi, and you can't use the SoC for your own board, because it's proprietary(Broadcom). So if you're building a device with it, there's no way to guarantee a supply. Also, the ARM1176JZF-S core is pretty weak compared to other ARM implementations.
In all likelihood, their prototype is built with a Raspberry Pi, but their production model is going to have something *completely* different in it, such as a SoC from TI, Atmel, or STM. Hell, they'd be better off going with a different *proprietary chip*, from people who are actually interested in selling to the public, such as Tegra or Exynos. The Rasp Pi was probably just a publicity grab.
Just look at the note section from Sparkfun's website: "Note: The supply of Rasbperry Pi is incredibly limited. We do not expect to get very many at a time and even those shipments will be sporadic at best. We are ordering the maximum allowable, but it will still not cover all backorders."
