If you waited 13 days for your coins, wouldn't you be upset?

Guys....this also means anyone who ever had an account on Gox now has their information compromised. Most likely your exchange password here, although salted and hashed (god forbid hopefully), is now available to this crew to hash against. Fyi

Just emailed you regarding purchasing shares

After 13 days; 9 emails (with no response whatsoever), and $6k in Coins i cant move to my wallet. Yeah. I am upset. Stop being Mr. Liberal
"Just be honest about it. You didn't get on that tech support chat to help get your coins" Actually, less than 20 minutes after leaving the chat. I got my coins. So take what you will from it, but it worked.

Finally confirmation! Thanks all
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:30:57
Okay, but I didn't send this....an exchange did. What to do? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:57:03
If I have to send the exact amount of the original patent transaction, how can I set a higher fee? That's all I have in my wallet. Fml
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:13:21
.0005 fee 
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:49:42
Wait for what?  Will they eventually all go through?
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:36:09
In using mycellium. I can't set a custom fee, would priority work? 
@_date: 2017-01-10 15:31:52
Looks like I am effed. I have 3 transactions all now just sitting unconfirmed....
@_date: 2017-01-10 16:07:36
Okay. Is there anything else I can do, or just wait and cross my fingers? I am using Mycellium.....and haven't been able to find a wallet I can export out mycellium into with the HD keys.
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:52:21
I tried rending to myself. I'm not sure what is going on....still nothing
@_date: 2017-01-10 14:42:36
So what do I do? If I can't resend out of my wallet I am screwed?
