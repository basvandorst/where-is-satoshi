Gonna use one of these to make a new watchface for my pebble. Thanks!

I really appreciate all of your recommendations. This is a fairly new interest of mine, and I don't know a whole lot about it.

That actually helps me out a lot. Comcast put a 300gb cap on my data a few months ago and I keep going over.

Thank you so much. I've been needed to put some BTC in cold storage, but I thought it was too much work. You really put together a great tutorial here, it was one of the first results when I searched for "cold storage".

Now that looks pretty cool. They even have XBMC and chrome plugins. I might have to do the trial on that one.

Reported. Thanks for the link.

Is the usage unlimited per month or do you pay by hours? I glanced their website earlier, but I couldn't find a solid answer.

I'm definitely going to have to check them out. Thanks!

Hey cool site! I really like that. 
@_date: 2014-09-06 20:52:00
Thanks a ton! 
Looks pretty good to me, this might be what I end up going with.

Thanks! Have you ordered from either of these sites? Any experience?

Just purchased 3 days for a little over $1 just to try it out. So far so good.

That's great to hear! I don't have a ton, but I've always been paranoid about my wallet getting hacked. Now I might be able to sleep at night!
