You tell me to not make broad assumptions and then you go and make broad assumptions.  You’re a loser for chastising someone on how they got their dog, period. 
Good luck out there.

How about you don’t spend other people’s money?  I’ve rescued both Of my dogs and love them but I’d never tell someone they are wrong for buying a dog. I prefer adopting but there are pros and cons to doing it.

I wish I was still a kid. Wouldn’t have a mortgage to pay. ��

This is like telling someone that eating red meat causes heart attacks and they should be Vegan instead when they didn’t ask you.

How about she does whatever she wants to?  I’m an adopter but this narrative about how it’s awful that people buy from breeders is fucking sickening.  There are GREAT breeders out there.

Of course there are. But you aren’t seeing the point that rescue dogs, which are definitely prone to having behavioral issues, are not for everyone. If someone wants a dog from a breeder it is none of your or anyones business.

Not at all. If someone has children and wants to get a dog for them, there is no telling what kind of behavioral problems rescues dogs can have.  Or they can go to a reputable yellow lab breeder and know what they are getting.  Same with hunting dogs.  
Again, I adopt and love my two dogs i adopted but it’s not for everyone.  One of my rescues has huge behavioral issues, which I’m 100% OK with but he wouldn’t be for everyone.

Because it’s her money?
