The outcome is the same eventually. Markets will use the code and you can choose to: 
A. Mine bitcoin that you already have equipment to or 
B. Get community so mad that they will move on to a completely new coin with these features

No need to cry. The philosophy is not about bitcoin. It's for a better future. Moonkids cut profits or stfu and keep on bullin.

I also understand your worries. Bitcoin has been stuck in the block size debate limbo for a while now. Maybe buying a small portion of other coins will make you less worried about bitcoin, I don't know. I was kinda expecting this sideways worried market coming this time of the year. To me it seems the best time to buy more crypto :P
I really don't think regulation will ever do bad for bitcoin. It will probably end up like war on drugs :D
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:15:09

Yes. Hands down would recommend to everyone.

1 BTC = current US national debt after they have printed the shit out of fiat.
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:41:44
I personally have the ledger. The way you argue just sounds worrying to me tho. 
GettingGains is trying to say he can trust an open source code more than a closed one. You keep on answering that with a counter question. Im no expert so I can not verify either one of these solutions. The problem here is no expert can verify your code. I'm definitely not in attacking mode here. It just sounds to me that you are defending the fact that it is closed source.
@_date: 2017-01-09 08:25:05
Yup. You can run around in these circles forever.

How can anyone be mad at happy Hodlers? I see new merchant hype posts almost every day
@_date: 2017-01-19 12:31:20
But what about the 95% miner vote? Is it always gonna be required?
Well if the miners won't agree with the market. You basically know how the market is going to react -&gt; pressuring the miners.
@_date: 2017-01-10 13:38:25
I think a bitcoin will buy you a nice car in 2020. Or:
A vacation with hookers and blow. 
Shitloads of shitcoins.
Shitloads of fiat.
Shitloads of junkbonds.
@_date: 2017-01-25 07:02:28
Bitcoin development is becoming a slow political mammoth. But I think this is a problem that will be fixed after bitcoin gets real competition.

Funny to see bitcoiners declaring litecoin dead when they know the same bullshit was used on bitcoin. Segwit on litecoin would be a blessing for bitcoin community.
@_date: 2017-01-20 07:31:57
Thanks for the answer. I'm glad the core is taking it slow step by step.
@_date: 2017-08-25 09:49:43
If you want a strong decentralized system it needs to be resistant to things like this. Ofcourse some are gonna try to sabotage it.

@_date: 2017-01-19 13:38:11
Well this is going to work out in the end. If nothing ever happens some other crypto will do it. The market is not a fanboy. The market will choose a working option. In the end miners will need the users. If they can't adapt, users will naturally move on.
@_date: 2017-01-25 19:13:38
Well what else would you buy with that bitcoin money tho? Stocks at all time high? Currency created by endless debt printing? Debt? Precious metals? Bonds that had a 35 year bull run?
