Ah, similar to Monero then. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 10:54:28
in 2 years bitcoin will be the altcoin
@_date: 2018-01-11 11:04:40
This sort of human is a small reason that I don't want to invest in bitcoin. This type of character is prevalent in the bitcoin community, and they have a very elitist attitude. 
@_date: 2018-01-11 07:29:21
I would if i could send my bitcoin at a reasonable price
@_date: 2018-01-11 14:58:40
Yes but you do realise that the ICOs that are around now are nothing compared to what will happen when plasma is released? Businesses will be able to release their own tokens on to the ETH public chain. Take 1 look at the EEA and you will know what kind of companies I am talking about.

So which shitcoin have I tried to justify here? You know as well as I do that bitcoin is on its arse. You are trying to justify in your own mind why someone has an alternative opinion on a speculative asset by ridiculing them as a shitcoin bag holder. If I'd have invested in bitcoin I wouldn't have made half the money I have made on alts. 
I am fairly sure you don't properly research any altcoins and only come in to r/bitcoin subreddit. If you go in to r/cryptocurrency you will notice that it's only shills, and most of the coins they shill are shitcoins. There is coins out there that are going to be big though. Hell, they already are big. Look at Ethereum, it will be the king soon.

Probably because Ethereum is gaining more pairings on exchanges, and people are using Bitcoin much less.

Hahahaha i wonder why most comments are about high fees? Hmmm，it's a God damn mystery!

Because BCH scares the shit out of these people.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:05:04
Verge is terrible
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:04:35
MimbleWimble will be an XMR side chain.

Merchants are adopting Bitcoin Cash because of what is being done to Bcore. Scaling through block size increase is easily sustainable for the forseeable future.
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:45:27
It is full of people spouting off bullshit with no sources?

Its hilarious the paranoia of bitcoin investors.
@_date: 2018-05-22 09:53:28
Took 20 seconds to find a hate post in r/Bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:58:34
No, because it's not a bitcoin hard fork that has the magnitude of BCH.
@_date: 2017-08-02 04:24:21
Proportional. I'd wait for now and see what happens with BCH
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:29:14
Yea they've only had 8 years to plan for block increases. Jesus christ. 
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:45:40
Simple，don't hold bitcoins. It's a fucking joke of a crypto these days and the tech is way behind a lot of other coins. Crypto needs a new deserved champion that isn't run by corruption.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:49:26
Yea i feel bad for them too. So glad i talked my dad out of buying at ATH haha.
@_date: 2018-02-06 10:41:15
$5 is still too high

China only went to sleep a few of hours ago. They will have already known.
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:57:57
He would make a lot of people very rich
@_date: 2017-09-28 11:29:06
I'll do it for free
@_date: 2017-09-22 04:01:37
There's loads these days.

Oh, nice one. Could you possibly send me high res version?

Hmmm, if I didn't know any better, I'd say these posts are paid shills? Or maybe just plebs.
@_date: 2017-09-24 08:05:43
I would have said it, not just thought it!
@_date: 2017-09-18 13:24:20
Lets get some prints done, I'd like to buy one.

He doesn't want you to know that nobody likes him.
