Some thing happened to me.

This is a good sign :)

It was a total scam for me but not for someone who picks up this contract for a fraction of my costs.

It appears as though both the email in question as well as the known Coinbase emails are using amazon for email. 
Is there a way I can validate that this transaction id exists or at least was initiated outside of the coinbase server? Is that transaction specific to coinbase?

Coinbase is legit and I have followed their compliance and pro-active approach towards regulations in the U.S. I have used their customer service in the past and have received a reply in 2 days in the past. A little slow but at least semi-acceptable. 
Someone did get back to me and ask for additional information. I sent it to them and waiting for a response...
It would be nice if they had a ticket system

That's how I learned about BTC originally.

The Bitcoin Google+ community is nice as well
@_date: 2013-12-09 03:46:26
It's the first place I go as well.

wow! thank you for offering - they did eventually get back and re-push the deposit request.

So it is Baidu - that's crazy...

I was looking on the site a few days ago for a legend for the very same things - I'm glad you asked that.

This thread has been allot of help understanding what's going on right now. Thank you for posting.

As a consumer it would be nice if there was a W3C Standards Type  organization that could verify compliance of standards with a website seal or something.

They replied not sure what happened but they ended up resubmitting the transaction to my back. Something has to be done with their customer service. No trouble shooting tickets, no way to review where your ticket is, no live chat, no phone number.... I still have not heard from them on a possible fraud situation. Hey coinbase:  &lt;- check this out.
