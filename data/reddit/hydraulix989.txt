Okay, I will not post this web link again on your sub-Reddit (this is Can I still release my code on GitHub for you to review? I am even open to making it a standalone tool since mine is still the only available recovery tool that scans through the transactions.
Regardless, if future support is added for bgold (will it be? If so, I can also update my tool to support recovering bitcoin gold!), an attacker cannot claim bgold with just the mnemonic because the GreenAddress API call `com.greenaddress.vault.sign_alt_tx` *only* works when two factor is enabled (it takes in a mandatory two factor auth code as a parameter, and without this two factor auth code parameter, it won't sign any altcoin transactions).
Right now, the unfortunate trade-off for many looks like this: finally recovering potential $1000s of previously-inaccessible BCH and not being fully insulated against future forks *if their two-factor is compromised* versus not having their BCH at all because there currently exists no GreenAddress-sanctioned recovery method for allowing users to recover their lost BCH.

Okay, I'm generating the correct keys now, and one of my redeem scripts that I generate is matching the actual one in the spending transaction!
YEESSSSSSSSSSSS!!! :) :) :)

You're quite welcome!

send all your bitcoin first out of the wallet (just to be safe) and enable 2fa
EDIT: no need to disable SEGWIT anymore

I am still working out how to generate the P2SH redeem script without extracting it from a known non-SEGWIT spending transaction (note that other inferior tools like the two garecovery forks also have this same limitation). Any guidance on this would be appreciated? Regardless, I will spend more time this weekend and I will figure it out on my own for sure.

I'm currently researching this problem, also currently only having success recovering from non-SEGWIT addresses. Any ideas ?

Sounds good, thanks for following up with me. Of course, I am more than happy to update my code for you once a GreenAddress API supporting a more secure authentication mechanism is implemented.
If users are concerned about the hosted version being different than the published source code, then they are also more than welcome to self-host it.
FWIW, the bcash fork of the garecovery tool asserts false if there is no SMS or email TFA is enabled in `twofactor.get_config`, but I haven't tested the API-side behavior to verify that it does, in fact, work without the parameter.

It's really not that big of a deal.

This is why I suggest emptying your wallet before using my tool. Regardless, even with your mnemonic, an attacker would need your two-factor SMS or email codes to do anything with your coins.
