1) More code = room for bugs
2) Your idea is easily exploitable by malicious actors. For example, a group of miners can disconnect themselves from the rest of the network, decide that the 'hash rate dropped more than 55%' and make their own chain longer than the rest of the network. Then when they reconnect to the rest of the hashing network they will have the longest chain and win out over the legit chain.
You are not thinking this through.

Bitcoin addresses are hashes of the public key, so QCs will not compromise ALL addresses, just the ones that's had output transactions (and therefore had the actual public key posted to the block chain)
To protect from this, always send your change to a new address and never re-use old addresses. Once you've spent money from an address it's vulnerable to quantum computers.

Earlier this year (before the $200+ spike) the Winklevii had 108k BTC correct? So after the price dropped back to about $100 the Winklevii started buying again, and over the weeks they gradually bought another 92k BTC giving them this 200k BTC.
This is why the price of BTC is dropping now, they Winklevii stopped buying. They should continue buying to keep the price up until their ETF launches.

If you mine bitcoin you should be paying income tax on the profit when you sell (e.g. on MtGox or whatever) Yes you can deduct the cost of electricity and a portion of the cost of your computer etc. Talk to your tax accountant or phone the ATO, they should be able to help you. 
They catch people in 2 ways: When you get money deposited into your bank account (e.g. by MtGox or whoever you sell your bitcoin to) you have to be able to explain where that money came from and why you are receiving it. 
The other way they catch people is by looking at your assets. If you suddenly own a ferrari but your annual income is only 50k they'll come asking questions about that.
If you sell $500 worth of bitcoin for cash anonymously you'll probably get away with it. If you sell $50,000 worth it becomes harder.

VA does not increase expected returns. The high IRR is due 
to hindsight bias.
 
- Invests gradually (inefficient diversification)
- Unpredictable cashflows require investors to hold larger 
proportion of cash/liquid assets.
- Complex (higher management/transaction/tax costs)
Thus VA is an inefficient strategy. Investors who value behavioural finance benefits likely to prefer DCA (stable cashflows).
VA is popular because of cognitive error: investors mistakenly assume that higher IRR means higher profits.

AM didn't increase the hash rate, it just recovered to previous levels after a short outage. As far as I know the target is still about 25% of the global hash rate which is where it is right now so there's no immediate need to increase.

I don't understand, can you explain the scenario to me?
As I see it:
- Legitimate customer signs up for Coinbase, links their bank account, links their phone for 2FA.
- Customer makes a small purchase and waits a month(!) to get verified for Level 2
- Now the customer can make instant purchases using his 2FA and bank account linked 30 days prior
How is this vulnerable to stolen bank accounts? As I see it:
- Identity thief gains control of a bank account
- Signs up for Coinbase and 2FA with a disposable phone
- Makes a small purchase and waits 30 days(!!!) for level 2 verification
And at this stage the owner of the bank account will realise that their identity was stolen, won't they? Does it often take more than 30 days for people to realise that their bank account is pwned? If so you can just make it 90 days to get to Level 3 and bring back the 50BTC limit then? What's the risk, what am I missing here?

Asicminer currently controls about 15% of the total network hash rate. Let's say AM turned evil tomorrow. What AM can do is disconnect itself from the other 85% of the network, 'agree' with itself to reduce the difficulty by 90%, and mine 96 blocks very quickly (with no block reward but who cares about that), generating a much longer chain than the rest of the network. Then when it's ready it can re-connect to the rest of the network but since AM has a longer chain, the AM chain will be deemed 'valid' even though it was made using only 15% of the total network hashrate.
Basically you've added a mechanism which allows a malicious actor controlling only about 10% of the network to artificially boost it's own hash rate by 10 times and conduct a 51% attack easily.
A much simpler, better and less exploitable solution to the (in my opinion non-existent) problem you see is simply recalculating the difficulty more frequently. Let's say every 200 blocks instead of every 2016.

This is correct.
If, however, you have a sum of money available today to invest, the best course of action is just to invest it all as soon as possible.

I don't have time to compile a complete formal mathematical proof for you right now but maybe I can give you the intuition:
First assume that you're investing in a market that you expect to increase in value over time. This is a reasonable assumption because otherwise you'd just keep your cash. Now think about your expected return on investment (ROI) which is proportional to the amount you invest multiplied by the time in the market. From this it's clear that you should invest as early as possible because maximising your exposure to the market will maximise your ROI.
But what about variations in the market you ask? What if the price goes down before going up? Well let's assume that we can't predict the market, which is a reasonable assumption because if we could we'd not bother with VA or DCA or lump-sum-day-one at all, we'd just invest in the optimal time. So since we can't predict the market and we expect an increasing market price over time we know that the probability that the price will go up tomorrow is GREATER than the probability that it will go down tomorrow. So while the price will fluctuate day-to-day, on average we know it will rise meaning, again, we want our money in there ASAP.
Does that make sense?
If it's still not intuitively obvious, think about this: On a very long time scale the stock price will look like it's just steadily increasing with almost no bumps and dips, and in such a case you obviously just want to be invested as much as possible from the very start. The more you 'zoom in' the bigger the bumps and dips become. If you're looking at a VERY short time scale the bumps and dips become massive. Do you believe that at some point VA or DCA becomes mathematically better than just investing ASAP? How would you calculate exactly where this point lies? 
Of course mathematically the answer is still that investing ASAP is optimal in a market where you expect an increasing value over time.
From  :
  Based on this research, an investor should **make the largest up-front investment possible,** even consider borrowing
From  :
Value averaging **does not boost profits,** and will in fact suffer substantial dynamic inefficiency.

Compare these scenarios: 
I take my BTC and send it to an exchange for USD, and then I use the USD to buy something
I take my BTC and I buy something, and the vendor then exchanges the BTC for USD
The BTC in question only stays out of the exchange for a short period (maybe a day on average) which is not that big of a difference and will not really affect the price much. 
Scenario 2 is better not because it 'keeps it in the economy'. It's better because we cut out one middleman: Visa. The buyer wins because he's not paying the BTC exchange fee, and the vendor wins because the BTC exchange fee is lower than what Visa would have charged.

The largest wallet on the blockchain only has about 100k BTC but there's no reason to believe that DPR or anyone would keep all their millions in one single wallet.

The ONLY reason inflation is good for anyone is that it allows a country to inflate away debts simply by printing more money. It amounts to a 'tax on everyone' that cannot be beat by tax evasion. And it's politically easier to do than to increase taxes. 
Saying that it 'encourages investment' is just bullshit. People will invest anyway.

Buy at any one of these links:
Some of them are 1/100s of a share so that's why the price is 0.03 BTC instead of 3 BTC

This is a bad argument. If I put my regular money in a savings account I also make money by 'doing nothing' so what's the difference here? It's 'bad for borrowers'? What? There's lots of lending going on already and no reason to think it won't keep growing.

It's not really that expensive and they insure it 100% so there's zero risk.

Here's how I do that same transaction: Ask the landlord for their bank details, log onto my online banking, transfer $4000.

Gambling is a service. Services should not be excluded just because there's no physical 'goods' exchanged! For example, let's say I sell insurance in BTC. No goods are exchanged but it's still a legitimate transaction!

Example: The insider knows that the company is going to sell for big bucks, so before telling the market he buys a load of shares and profits from it at the expense of other investors. It's unfair. All shareholders of a company should have the same information about the company they own so they can make good decisions for themselves. If this is allowed to happen many investors would flee that stock, because they're playing a rigged game.

I recommend getting direct shares from the forum:
With all the other options you have to trust both the share exchange and Asicminer. With the direct shares you only trust Asicminer. You can use an escrow at a small additional cost if you want.
Basically what you do is you find someone selling AM shares in that forum, post on their thread stating how many shares you want, and send them the bitcoin. You then also tell them what your bitcoin address is - this address will then receive all the dividends from next week on. It takes about a week for the transfer to happen because the Asicminer guy (Friedcat on the forum) must manually do the transfer and he's pretty busy.

They do get processed, they just take longer.

If you bought BTC a year ago you'd be better off than if you ordered a BFL Jalapeno. I'm not sure what's so controversial about that?

Yea well fuck Paypal. Ask Paypal for a refund and if they refuse get your credit card company to do it and write off your Paypal account.

After 2 months they can withdraw your money from PayPal and they don't care about chargebacks anymore. Paypal will tell the buyer to go fuck themselves. Amex might be different.

The 'stuck in customs' story is BULLSHIT. There's no shipping documentation or any other proof that he's actually shipped anything and that it is in fact being held up in customs. I can't even work out which country's customs he's talking about. Why would Chinese customs hold up OUTBOUND packages? It's just smoke and mirrors until I see proof.

The new difficulty calculation uses the time it took to do the last 2016 blocks. It adjusts the difficulty so a block is 10 minutes on average. That's how it uses time.

If I knew that insider trading was OK for a certain company I would never buy stock in that company because, as you admit, 'it's a rigged game' 
What about the opposite situation? The CEO knows the company is bankrupt and the stock will go to zero. So he keeps it quiet and over the next few weeks sells all his shares on the open market. Then he comes out and says 'woops all those shares I just sold you? SUCKER they are worth nothing!'
How can this be OK? A CEO is supposed to maximise shareholder profits, not fuck them over.
