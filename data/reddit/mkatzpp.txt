Everytime a woman buys a bitcoin Paul Walker eats her out?
@_date: 2014-01-02 22:14:29
Almost none. People on here barely own any Bitcoins much less have any influence. 
Think about huge price increases and then the declines. Reddit users are responsible for .0000000001% of that movement.

Just a reminder that you're overcharging based on $825/BTC vs your $990k house. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 04:40:55
$911?  I've been in the $800s all day. Roughly at $825 now. I'll sell you mine for $911 if you're interested. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:18:51
Agreed. Much better pricing model.

I've never had any issues with coinbase either.  I think they're amazing.  Plus with instant BTC funding they take all the risk.  Anyone can buy BTC, xfer BTC out and close their bank account.

1-pick a well hidden location for privacy
2-avoid eye contact if possible
3-try to not make any small talk because that might lead to uncomfortable eye contact
4-go about the exchange as quickly as possible and then GTFO immediately
5-go home and realize coinbase is the best option for avoiding all human contact

Yeah, I mean a lot goes into math, statistics and probability.  The fact is that I've watched him and he alters his bet a lot.  It's just basic blackjack odds.  you bet small until the shoe favors you and then slam.  that's sort of what he does.  
Since the site itself tracks your win/loss count in theory you can slam if you're ever below 50% because in theory the coinflip odds will shift in your favor.  Its not so much about the amount he's won, but more about the % of flips he's won.   
The other thing he has going for him is the speed at which he bets and alters his bet amounts.  I'd be surprised if he doesn't have a bot running making his wagers for him based on his win/loss record and the streak he's running on.  its just not humanly possible to place a bet every 2 seconds and alter amounts as quickly as he does.
Its like anything gambling related -- there are ways to game/break the system.
While I'm not saying that's he cant be cheating, i'm saying that cards, luck, probability and a lot of other variables are VERY streaky when it comes to games of chance.  And i've seen him sit down and after getting up 2000 BTC, spend the next hour losing 5000 back.

The blockchain app is about as good as it can be, fully functional for transferring and receiving.
The coinbase app sucks balls.  it gives you transaction history and balance but nothing else.
Most of the other apps are just price tickers.
Apple has banned Bitcoin stuff so the good apps are long gone.
@_date: 2013-12-18 17:12:18
If you all kill yourself it removes a ton of bitcoins from the economy and the price goes up proportionately.

Appreciate the responses.
@_date: 2013-09-26 13:25:34
Seriously? The bot would tell with what to do without emotion making the best possible mathematical decisions.  It would also adjust bets size and make bets faster than him.  If you watch his betting patterns and the way he adjusts the size its unlikely he's doing it manually.  
And to be clear, I'm not saying the bot is "telling" him what to do, I'm saying its a program/bot actually doing the playing/betting.
Are you not familiar with online gambling/betting/poker/blackjack at all?
@_date: 2013-09-25 14:45:11
He's been playing for at least 3 hours since that's when I first saw him.
The profit counter started at -4200.  I saw him hit a peak low of -3700 and then he went on a tear up to -5900.  
He's now at roughly -4800
also, he bets too quickly and alters his amount too rapidly.  i'm sure it a bot running for him doing tons of calculations based on probabilities and his currents trends.

seriously, you thought buying and selling .1 BTC was worthy of a post?
Who gives a rats ass?  spend less time posting about your ridiculous insignificant buys and spend MORE TIME BUYING!

I think your best bet is to just let bitcoins do their job.  The rate of return on bitcoins has been FAR greater than the rate of return on almost everything else on the planet since its inception.  
And if you're here as an early adopter you already feel it has much higher potential.  Most agree that bitcoins will probably level out at $500 sometime soon, $1000 shortly thereafter and right around $10,000 within a few years.  
Bitcoins themselves are the investment with a potential 15,000% rate of return based on global adoption.  Why risk investing BTC in something else for another 5% rate of return with a higher risk of loss.  
Its like pot odds in poker.  you don't risk $250 to win a $25 pot.

i cant tell if this is real, but i know i started search the web for bitbook when i couldn't access my account about 15 minutes ago.  either someone jumped on this quickly with lies to make people panic or he's right on the mark. 
considering i cant access the website, i'm leaning towards true...

its the strangest thing.  Anytime i try and scan a qr code from paper it doesn't import it, but the same paper will scan using other apps (blockchain, coinjar).  meanwhile if i try to scan the same qr code on my computer with all the computer lines, it does scan and import the address.
so it works for certain scans but not others.  i have no idea what the deal is and of course i cant delete the app and re-install since its no longer available.
@_date: 2013-10-27 21:50:35
where does one find that and what does it look like?

I got this last night when I downloaded the app.  this morning (maybe 7 hours later) I was still getting that error.  Its now about 3 hours later and I'm still getting this error.
Anyway coinbase reps can help us out here?  
I tried deleting the app and reinstalling and that didn't help either.

Bitbook.biz has been solid. BTC on and off in minutes. 
@_date: 2013-10-17 17:15:49
Thanks. This is my first issue with coinbase.  They're usually just as fast as everyone else on a daily basis.  
But honestly if you add up the time my first 50 transfers out took, they dont total the amount of time this one has taken.  I'll hope things turn out and this is just an anomaly.  
Might've saved me money since I was going to bet the under of an nba game and it could go either way right now...
phily at charlotte was under 191.5 -- lets see if coinbase saved me 10 BTC or cost me 10.4.
@_date: 2013-10-17 17:39:58
COINBASE SAVED ME MONEY.  I would have lost my bet.  Took a 4th quarter miracle to lose, but it was a loss none the less.
VIVA LA COINBASE!
@_date: 2013-10-08 17:37:36
i would say the average USER (not total bitcoins divided by the billions on the planet) still owns less than 1.  The reason being that if you watch the exchanges you'll see 80-90% of buys/sells are for less than 1 coin.  if you follow the blockchain amounts being transferred/used i would say 80-90% are for less than 1 coin.
@_date: 2013-09-12 21:07:12

@_date: 2013-12-27 19:02:46
This thread is irrelevant because you probably have 10 fellow employees that would float you until monday.  Having bitcoins didn't save you, having people you work with who know you is what did.
This would make sense if you were at Walmart and you realized you didn't have your wallet and some random dude behind you paid in exchange for bitcoins.
As it stands, you dont need to pay her back today because you can hand her a $20 when you see her next.
Silly post.

while dice have no money and can independently roll above the number 50, 100000000000000 times in a row, the fact is that longterm odds will always even out.  that's why you dont flip a coin once or 10x and use those statistics as the actual odds.  odds are based infinite flops or rolls and over a long haul they will play to the mean.  
if he's running below EV its likely he'll run towards +EV going forward.  Assuming the site is legit and probability isn't skewed on the back end.
Its really short sighted to use gamblers fallacy here since the guy manipulates his betting amounts and places roughly 2000-5000 bets in a sitting.  The truth is that the odds will even out close to 50/50 in the end.
