First thing SeansOutput is that you arent running a business, you are running a charity. In a business you make some good or service in order to rip money out of customers grimy little hands, in a charity you woefully sit on the street corner begging for change. 
Now if you run something like a goodwill you can turn a charity into a business, but since everything is e-this and e-that bitcoin wont go there. 
Ill tell you a secret as a long time entreprenuer that will get you through this ordeal, if it feels bad, dont do it. That horrible suicidial feeling comes from you not listening to yourself, stop chasing after that dream, its becoming a nightmare. 
You may think you are doing the right thing, or maybe this is your passion, but this is not the way to go about doing it. Look at the feedback so far with your project, has there been a tremendous community outpouring? Chances are if you feel depressed this is not the case. Why hasnt the community come forth and donated their twice daily $5 starbucks frappachino money to your project? Might it be that people by and large are greedy selfish trash that only care for their own immediate needs?
But then the same trash tries to make you feel bad when you realize this fact about them. That frustrated feeling is you fighting the truth, people are greedy trash and they are not going to help you or anyone else. 
So you still want to help others right, how do you get this money? Take it from them. That part ill leave up to you, but when you have been trained by these monkies to think that screwing them over is somehow wrong, remember all the people they have wronged spending $500 to get the newest iphone instead of helping those who are facing the end.
