Bitcoins goodness comes in that it was the first cryptocurrency.
Its goals and ideas are good, but it is not perfect. I don't even think its the best one at least technologically.
I hope bitcoin succeeds. I hope altcoins succeed as well.
I don't believe in a world with just one cryptocurrency. We need a market where there are multiple different currencies, each with their own idea how the digital-money should be.
@_date: 2017-03-25 17:35:06
Bitcoin is not perfect, there are many things that some altcoins do better.
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:46:36
If altcoins are tulips, then so is the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-03-25 16:22:42
How is that good?
Having a choice is good. Blindly believing in one true cryptocurrency is religion.

You are a fool. The 5th is there to shield everyone. It's impossible to use that kind of law just for the innocent.
@_date: 2017-03-21 19:37:46
You can't eat your cake and have it too.
Either the evidence is there or there isn't. If the hashes are enough to jail him, then why does it matter that he doesn't unlock his drive. Just charge him with what you have and be done with it. But if the evidence is not enough, then the accused has no business helping with your case.
Keeping him in jail for contempt is a dangerous precedent.

If a single miner can do that, then bitcoin is fucked anyways. The idea is that you measure the consensus by measuring the economic investment of the mining power. If you want to vote whether the chain is valid, go buy a miner.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:50:25
In a way yes, but if you are saying that people just need to download bitcoin cash and use it, you are perpetually in the fog about how much it is used. The only things you know is how much hashpower is there and how much volume is there. One of them tells you about the miners, the other about the users. And you can only tell the volume, because bitcoin cash forked off. Without the fork it is unclear how many users use certain implementation.
In any case, samourai dev disagrees with you, he is saying that no matter how much bitcoin cash is used, that they will never support it.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:38:58
The only way to measure those is by POW. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 17:31:00
Well for now it is bitcoin cash, but it all depends, if it manages to gain higher hash rate than the bitcoin core, then it become THE bitcoin. Longest chain is the bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-08-27 20:24:20
What the fuck does "valid" even mean? If the chain has the most work done on it, then it is by definition bitcoin and it is valid.
@_date: 2017-08-28 09:36:49
Your non-mining node does nothing for one simple reason. It is extremely cheap to run a lot of them. If someone wanted they could run a thousand of them that enforced different ruleset. Miners on the other hand are both expensive to buy and expensive to run. That makes it prohibitively expensive to use them to attack the network.
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:18:35


Just let me get this straight. You just said that bitcoin has central authority. Are we bank now?
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:27:06
What would have to change for some other devs to be the ones in charge then? 
@_date: 2017-08-28 15:35:56
How do you measure that? You can measure how much mining is done by certain software. You can't do it with transactions.
@_date: 2017-08-28 10:34:03
Well obviously if you are dealing with a lot of bitcoin, you want your own node, just to be extra sure. What I mean is that if you are just running a node or a hundred of them just to help the network, then you are just being silly.
And for deciding what is or isn't bitcoin. There is no central authority that decides what rules are valid and which are not. So the only way to know what chain is bitcoin, is to see which one has consensus. And the best way to tell consensus is to see how much money is invested in securing said chain.
@_date: 2017-08-21 15:34:35
If it is not in the code then it is meaningless.
@_date: 2017-11-21 00:46:43
Watching both subs with no stake in either bitcoin or bitcoin cash is pretty fun actually.
Before the fork was like - "Just fork already". Now we are commenting on people brigading against bch wallet. On the other hand is changing what it wants to happen pretty often.
@_date: 2017-11-20 13:08:14
How do you propose you should stop them from doing that?
@_date: 2017-11-20 22:29:50
Lets not pretend is any better. Both subs are pretty cancerous. If nothing else the whole business thought me not to mess with crypto nerds, they can go from normal to full on raving maniacs very quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:03:20
That's the unfortunate truth of bitcoin. That 1700 bitcoins at 0.3$ is 510$, at that point if you are living paycheck to paycheck it is significant amount of money, that you can spend on necessities. People like to go about bitcoin success stories, but those are really rare. Holding for a long time, unless you are already well of is almost impossible. Even if you are true believer. Being potential millionaire in a few years, doesn't put food on your table now.
@_date: 2017-11-20 20:08:30
So did the cryptoanarchists make this technology to make rich people richer then?
@_date: 2017-04-27 09:06:21
Those issues are entirely unrelated. Bitmain is bad, therefore segwit is not a proper chain of causation.
The more I read both and the angrier I get. Neither side is acting rationally. Personally I think the fork should happen as soon as possible and the better coin should win the proper way (by providing better service), instead of this shit flinging we see now.
@_date: 2017-04-13 17:11:07


That is just unfortunate side effect of capitalism. No matter whether it's nodes or miners who make the rules. People with more money can have more of either of those things.
Unless there is some magical programmed way to distinguish people, there's no way to have proper democracy in bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-04-15 17:58:51
What would be the point of not using LN then?
@_date: 2017-09-24 20:36:39
I mean whatever core is doing doesn't have an overwhelming consensus.
@_date: 2017-09-27 16:19:34
Bitcoin can still fail and never recover. If it actually succeeds then it is a pretty good definition of getting lucky.
@_date: 2017-09-26 17:33:02
Yeah, I just find the whole hodl at all costs mindset a little bit damaging to the well being of bitcoin. It was made to be used, speculating and hodling is not using. 
@_date: 2017-09-26 16:53:55
You do realize that unless people actually spend BTC, it will never be worth what it should be worth.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:16:45
Except solution to this is very simple. Increase block size. Scaling is not slow and painful, it is literally children fighting over stupid shit that doesn't really matter while other coins are the ones that are actually innovating. 
@_date: 2017-10-19 16:17:54
I do agree that forks need consensus. But this consensus is stuck for years now. I dread to think what will happen when something more drastic needs to be implemented.
@_date: 2017-10-04 16:39:41
No matter which side you stand on, I am still more worried that it is even required. Banning nodes is not what the bitcoin about. If the node is acting maliciously sure ban it, but that needs to be on a case by case basis, if there's attack coming from the node.
Change of protocol is not an attack.
@_date: 2017-10-19 13:22:42
If bitcoin is just replacement gold, it is entirely pointless.
If you cannot use it for daily purchases then it brings nothing new to the table.
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:19:56
The 2x nodes relay the same information for now.
@_date: 2017-10-19 15:43:02
8mb can be done on a 5 year old pc. It is non issue. You can't expect to run a node on a potato. It's all good to want decentralization, but at some point you have to realize that transacting is actually more expensive than running a node and that is backwards. If you do not transact tens of thousands of dollars, you do not need to run your own node.
As for miner centralization even if running a node cost thousands of dollars, it would still be tiny expense compared to the vast hashing equipment and electricity you need to be able to find a block in a reasonable amount of time.
@_date: 2017-10-14 13:06:38
Sorry but if your currency is not used by criminals, then it is an useless currency.
@_date: 2017-05-03 11:35:19
Shitpost is shitpost. No one knows what will happen. And its disingenous to suggest that the only thing standing between you and your investment trippling is segwit.
@_date: 2017-05-04 05:50:54
I can agree with that, at this moment bitcoin doesn't have that much going for it, besides its name.
@_date: 2017-05-04 19:00:25
It's probably just envious bitcoin segwit supporters buying into it. The same thing is very unlikely to happen to the same degree with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-05-26 08:34:40
What prevents someone from setting up a hundred nodes for cheap?
@_date: 2017-07-04 20:23:32
I don't think coffee a day for everyone in the world is realistic. But unless everyone can afford on-chain transactions, the bitcoin will be a failed experiment. On-chain needs to scale too.
@_date: 2017-07-05 06:10:50
The thing is I am not opposed to off-chain solutions, I am just afraid that when the off-chain solutions are there, on-chain will be neglected in favor of them. That's why I want at least a symbolic gesture of raising the block size even a little bit, so that some people can't continue claiming that the block size increase is the end of the world.
@_date: 2017-05-03 13:51:08
Of course it's a big factor, I just find fault with people pretending that implementing segwit is 100% sure way for the bitcoin price to shoot to the moon.
@_date: 2017-06-15 16:32:46
It's very stupid. They might as well ask to declare all your money, since the password for your bank move with you too.
