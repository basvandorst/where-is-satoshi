Probably by Microsoft Frontpage. Other pages were created by Word 2007 and Adobe PageMill, a program nearing 20 years old.

While the on screen caption isn't great, it doesn't tell you anything as to the contents of the segment.

Taxes that most impact the people who can least afford it are always the best, after all. You'd think at least one country would have implemented this fantastic system already, but alas every one has a grand conspiracy against it.

The IRS is doing what it is intended to do - collect tax revenue. It's not an attempt to split the community, it just so happens that there's a significant population who believe that any form of taxation is evil, unjust, whatever, and oppose it in any form.
The only possible way to resolve that would be to declare bitcoins tax exempt, which would end up with bitcoin becoming a vessel for tax avoidance.

A bank account, photo ID and proof of address are 'compulsary to transact'. How is that much lower verification?
