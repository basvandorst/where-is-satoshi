I’ve been investing in this space since late ‘12 early ‘13.
My current portfolio is 50% global equities, 20% crypto (BTC ,ETH, MKR, SXN), 10% Gold, 10% cash (DAI earning ~6%), and 10% lent as private equity (We invest in ecommerce, fintech, and DeFi).
I’m 43 and retired at 36 because I’ve consistently kept my finger on the tech pulse. If you’re not invested in this space, that’s fine, but to think your “perspective” is somehow more valuable than someone else’s without knowing them is foolhardy. 
Good luck.

Exactly. If we’re to measure it in USD (or any other fiat currency) there’s no limit. 
This blows people’s minds because “a million is soooo much money”. The average family income in the US in 1950 was ~$3,300. The reason today it’s ~$56,000 is because fiat is inflationary. 
What will the dollar be worth, or more to the point *not worth*, in another 70 years? (If it exists).

You didn’t answer my question.
If “nobody owns any” bitcoin, how did you arrive at your “thought out and well reasoned” that we reached mass adoption?
You have a very weak argument backed by an even weaker position of “I bought bitcoin at $11k and sold at $14k”. What’s that, two weeks? You speculated for two weeks and that’s the base for entire argument?
As for “creating money out of the blue”, where do you think the money comes from now?

There’s ~36 million bitcoin wallets. Let’s assume each person only had one, which is unlikely. That means that ~0.46% of the world population has bitcoin.
This is your idea of mass adoption?
Also, I still have a stitch in my side from laughing so hard about how you think money is currently created. THAT was good.

In Sydney Australia, the current annual household disposable income per capita of $48,956 is just 13% above where it was in 2011. 
Thus, for a household in Sydney, the level of median house prices has gone from the equivalent of 12.3 years’ worth of the average per capita household disposable income to now being 17.9 years. 
Yes, it has fallen from the 22 years reached in June 2017 but, even after the fall, it is around a level equivalent to that during the early 2000s price boom. 
Australia is a one trick pony, the average citizen here is going to be hit VERY hard.

You should be sorry for being a dick. 
Okay then. Let’s look at May as an example. Price was ~$8,000. High compared to April when it was ~$5,000 but low when compared to June when it was ~$12,000. But we only know this now as it’s in hindsight. 
I’ll say this slowly so you can comprehend. 
High. And. Low. Is. Easy. In. Hindsight.

Not really. It’s a complicated scenario and consensus has not been drawn on the perfect solution. 


Don’t do this. Wills, after your death, become court documents and are generally public documents, accessible by anyone.

Warren Buffett is an interesting choice? He claims Bitcoin is rat poison. I wouldn’t be following much of what he says as advice. 
He made his first million by running a hedge fund. Then he switched to owning small banks. Then finally he shut down his hedge fund and put all his money into running an insurance company.
Most people, being mostly the same, will not have the ability to analyse 2-3 assets to invest in with absolute certainty. I’m happy you got lucky, but diversification against inexperience is wise. To argue against that is foolish.

That was not your statement. You said ATH. If you can predict highs and lows you’d be a millionaire.
Also, $15k was lower than $19k. Was that the time to buy? By your logic it was.

It wouldn’t matter. A common example would be a 2-of-3 split, which would split the data into three parts, where any two of the three parts are required to restore the data. But almost any m-of-n combination is possible, such as 4-of-6, or 15-of-15.

Are YOU that stupid? That does not make it a store of value. 
If I give you a dollar today you can predict what it will buy you tomorrow. If I give you BTC today you cannot predict what it will buy you tomorrow. In order for it to be a store of value it must be predictable.
We own BTC. It is a speculative investment and a limited-use-case medium-of-exchange. It is not, by definition, a store of value.

Are you smoking crack? We invest in both. Significant amounts. Gold liquidity far exceeds that of BTC.
@_date: 2019-12-15 00:17:17


Not entirely true. For example, I’ve sold goods for BTC, sold a business for BTC, been paid as a consultant in BTC, etc. 




Correct. Banks are not required to transact BTC between parties. It is P2P.

It serves this function. 


It doesn’t serve this function well. 
A store of value is the function of an asset that can be saved, retrieved, and exchanged at a later time, and be _predictably_ useful when retrieved.

Governments were not mentioned above. The statement referred to banks. Please stay on track with your arguments. 
Now, it does not say explicitly it is to “get rid of banks”, however, for the purpose of transactions (which was the intent) the abstract states;
_A purely peer-to-peer version of electronic cash would allow online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without going through a financial institution._
Financial institutions being banks.
