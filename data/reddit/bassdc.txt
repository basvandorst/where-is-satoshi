"designed in 80s and standardized in early 90s"
You direct criticism at PHP4, which has been deprecated for at least 5 years now, then you cite the wonders of Common Lisp which is conveniently immune to the same criticism because it was standardized two decades ago.
Look, okay, I said from the start that I hate to defend PHP but the security issues and your abhorrence of weak typing are a sideshow to the issue of badly programmed PHP websites. There is high demand for rapidly produced websites, and if your power language of choice were up to the task then maybe the internet would be a much better and more secure place. But turning a specific language like PHP into the culprit is like decrying the dominance of SUVs because you drive a BMW sedan, and not only do you drive a sedan but you think car manufacturers should not even be allowed to produce SUVs. It is an ecology, and while an ecology works much better when it is efficient and secure, it still works when there are areas of poor efficiency and security.

I really don't like defending PHP, but you are full of crap.
1. Hastily made? Okay, ten/fifteen years ago it was hastily designed. Fifteen years later this no longer means anything.
2. You make it sound as if there was one dev team, when by 1) there have been hundreds/thousnds of people developing the core php code, and even if they ignore security concerns that hardly makes them unique (viz Internet Explorer, developed by brilliant Microsoft programmers and which has arguably caused more security problems than any other application in the history of computing).
3. How exactly do dynamic typing and forgiving syntax promote error prone code more than other language features of every other language in use today?
4. Well if a deprecated API can be cited as a reason to shun some technology then again I would point to the wasteland of Microsoft Windows APIs as a reason to avoid .net, or the dangers of csh programming to avoid all unix and linux systems.

I would think the IRS (US) would be the most interested. Fortunately for most Bitcoin speculators, the IRS is dramatically underfunded and understaffed, so that mysterious income will likely go unnoticed for the near future.

Which is just another way of saying "It was a hastily built website because no one could afford the development time or programming costs of other, supposedly more 'professional' languages."
Because it is not like Facebook is written in PHP. Oh, wait...

Is this a bitcoin problem or a MtGox problem? OP essentially left a pile of cash in an insecure location, and that was an unwise decision. And of course MtGox can't reverse the transaction, unlike Paypal or some other fee-based escrow service.

I'm sorry but this is simply an argument based on bitterness. Yes, the world would be a better place if we could get rid of or otherwise ignore the things we don't like. And yes, education is generally the best path towards improving things. But the internet economy simply can afford to wait for the next generation of programmers who know how to do things right, and if you took php out of the picture then something else would fill that spot (like Visual Basic). If you want to shun any site that uses PHP then you limit your own options, just don't be so fucking righteous about it.

These are all major infrastructure costs, and the cost of infrastructure is how the current crop of legal banking institutions justify fees for their services. How are you going to "open source" these things?

Please reread my comment. Given that all exchanges will be under constant threat, those that provide long term stability will be the only ones to survive regardless of how often your fickle trader moves his account. As things become more secure, the interruptions should have less impact, but we are talking about an infrastructure that has had zero time to mature.

I love analysis that changes every three or four days.

How so? This is more than about being able to trade at some specific time, it is about the long term stability of a specific exchange. If an exchange is under attack and suspends trading, sure other exchanges can pick up those trades, but that assumes only one exchange is being targeted for attack. When all exchanges are under threat of attack, which they pretty much are, then long term stability provides the advantage.
