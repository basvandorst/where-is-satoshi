Honestly haven't looked at it in the past week or two. Last time I checked there where several issues still needing to be fixed for it to scale. Links to educate myself?

I hope so. It will prevent a massive crash if so. I just don't believe it will be ready anytime soon.

They are old USB miners. People would fill entire USB power strips with them. Back in the good ole days

The audience asks for an estimate, and they bounce around from a year to 18 months. This was 2 months ago.

I don't think Roger would send checks lol. If you want to talk and educate me on the the subject PM me. But because im being downvoted, I can only reply once every 10 mins. Plus I don't wanna get banned, so this Is my last comment reply.

The Lightning network has "been just around the corner" for years. You may be right! But I doubt it.

Only 18 months!

Someone hasn’t read the whitepaper.

Did you actually watch the video?

That's a very good point. If Lightning wallets enable this we shouldn't even have to see the web redirect.

It may be as trivial as creating a new address, but as you see on Andreas's page he posts one single address for donations. You cant do that with LN.
@_date: 2018-10-29 09:59:26
It's not the easiest thing in the world to accept donations with Lightning. Each transaction requires a unique invoice from the receiving party before anything can be sent. Andrea's would have to set up a payment processing server like BTCPAY, with predetermined donation tiers.

I've been using Zigzag to empty out my channels. The more realistic problem is that with Lightning you cant just send money to an address. The address owner must request a specific amount of money and create a non reusable invoice for that amount. Then you have to use the invoice to send the tip.

Posting the public key of cold storage wallet is a horrible idea. Delete this ASAP
