Either one works, just that Bitcoin wouldn't be a good idea right now because of fees and long confirmation.

I literally told them so many times in 2014, I was often replied with "It's a scam!", "Stocks are better", "I can be hacked", "No!".
Now I get to laugh at them

Not specifically Bitcoin, but I am now able to pay off my student loans thanks to crypto. I'm proud to say that I won't be in any debt when I graduate, actually a surplus of money.

Depends on what your degree is. If you chose STEM degrees, you shouldn't have a problem finding a job and paying off your loans. Arts may have a rough time.
