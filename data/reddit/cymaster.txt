I will use it for the future of my company, in which I alone programme some apps for android and doing support for linux os. Also I will support my 2 daughters in getting a good education and finally I will donate 100,000 € for the non-profit organization "doctors without borders" which is really the best. thank you in advance...

Raspberry 2 and 3 are definitely not underpowered to be a full node. My Raspi 2 is always online with bitcoin core 0.13.2, it has 200-300 MB free RAM from 1 GB, it has 70-80 connections to other clients using an external harddrive. It also works for me as a VPN Gateway, Samba Server and DNS Server. All on this Raspi, 24/7 online. First sync I did on a fast Windows PC and copied the databases to this harddrive. The only negative thing running a full node is the huge upload data volume, 20GB upload per day is normal for me.

For 1000 USD you get at least 10 Raspberry Pi, each with 500 GB harddrive. You really dont need 1000 USD for running a full node, I am personally running a Raspberry Pi for that very stable with very low energy costs.

You can copy an already synced up database to a new hard disc, instead of syncing from start. Syncing bitcoin core from start took always some days or weeks, I always have a backup in case of emergency. And believe me or not, even Raspi2 is powerful enough for running bitcoin core.

For desktop Electrum (over Tor) and the best mobile app is Mycelium (Android).
For a hardware wallet is prefer Ledger and as second Trezor.
