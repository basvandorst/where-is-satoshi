I ran an anti virus scan and found 8 threats in the bitcoin folder which I removed.  I use Linux so haven't had any issues up until now.

Unfortunately the article missed out the BTCD team up with  to bring out a debit card using the visa network.  :)

The only beta software I have tested lately is on my android and my Bitcoins are still there.

I found a bunch of viruses in the .bitcoin folder using ClamTK.

I am currently working on a hardware project dubbed "BlackBean" that will have machines accepting BlackCoin starting with a coffee vending machine.  I was inspired by the lightning fast transactions so decided it would be logical to do this with BlackCoin.

The mining hardware will be used to teach students how to put a rig together, solo and pool mine, identify profitable coins etc.. It will be a basic 3 card GPU rig, nothing overly expensive for educational purposes only.
We are planning on teaching people how to create coins so it would be only fitting that we launch our own.  It will mainly be for test purposes but may also help fund future lessons.  
Think of these as modules you have on a college course.

Initially as part of the training program to teach students how coins are created.  It may also help to fund the academy.

It looks like the transaction was sent before the coins were received.

I think a clean install is the best option.  Thanks for the help.  :)

I can't see any evidence on this thread of GAW being a scam.  Just theory, speculation and comparison to companies that have done wrong.  If it turns out it is a scam then then fair enough but there is no proof up until this point.  Its such a shame people preemptively scream scam so easy, it makes it hard for legit companies to operate.  You should all wait until something is proven before yelling "Scam" from the roof tops.  That is just as damaging as the actual scams themselves.

One of my ideas for the mining classes is to group research newly launched coins, vote on the one we want to mine, mine that coin when the rig is built, leave it over night, take the rig apart ready for the next lesson and distribute the coins to the students.  This is just an idea.

BitSwich and Bitcoin Kinetics are a complete SCAM.  I ordered one over a year ago and still have not received it nor have I received a promised refund.  I would avoid them like the plague.﻿

There is an ATM in Coex Mall, Samseong Station exit 6 on the subway.

Yes.  The FBI moved about 30m of the seized Silk Road coins to be auctioned and the transaction fees came out under $100.  I think it was $80 or something like that.

it will need to cover the transaction fee which is currently 0.0001.
So to sent 1 Satoshi you would need to send 0.00010001
