Who sold you that sob story?
Mining rewards will not half until 2020 and will not go down to zero until 2100-something.
You can also increase the fee reward per block by (who would've guessed it) increasing the amount of transactions in a block, instead of the amount of fees per transaction.  
But don't tell "them" that I told you that, it's our little secret!
@_date: 2018-01-29 14:35:35
Well yes, something changed: Demand for blockspace.  
Usually due to decreasing demand for transacting (=decresing adoption?).
Otherwise fees would still be as high as 300 sat/byte.

Serious question: For what?
@_date: 2017-12-17 09:19:08
So the wallet **app** can go look at the blockchain and see if you received something. A device with no internet connectivity cannot communicate with the blockchain.
If you want to be real secure and not risk getting your keys stolen via internet connectivity, use a paper wallet (once) or hardware wallet (multiple times).

Except this has nothing to do with Bitcoin because it only works within Coinbase. You could call it CBT (**C**oin**b**ase **T**oken) for all it's worth.
If you can't show your low fee Bitcoin tx confirmed, then you're talking about something different than this thread was about. See the comment of 1BitcoinOrBust you commented on:

link to tx, please?

Then what do you use the wallet app for?
Basic use cases that require internet connectivity to access the blockchain:
* broadcasting transactions
* checking transaction status/history
* checking blance (UTXO)
Advanced use cases that require internet connectivity to access other public data:
* fee estimations
* exchange rates (e.g. how much USD are your UTXOs worth)
* etc..
Things you can do without internet connectivity (edit: except in copay based wallets):
* create keys / addresses
* sign transactions, but not broadcast them (e.g. via QR code scanning, NFC or other means of close proximity connectivity without internet access)

X and Y have a banking account (Coinbase "wallet") at the same bank (Coinbase) and buy/sell off each other just moving numbers in the banks database.
Sounds more like something we've had for decades already before Bitcoin came along and removed that third party from the equation.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:22:05
I agree with you. I simply couldn't agree with your previous statement which I may allow to rewrite as "look at my usecase, I present it as **evidence** that there are low tx fees possible, except it's not using a blockchain or Bitcoin tx at all".
Case closed, thank you for this civil discussion.

What.. why? Any wallet will need an internet connection.
Sure, key generation can be offline. But then what? The attack vector is having an internet connection and not monitoring the traffic your phone sends to dozens of servers every hour.
Any wallet app could relay your private key (e.g. hidden, by encrypting it with a public key where only the dev has access to the corresponding private key) at any point in time.
If you're paranoid, don't use apps and/or wallets on a device with any kind of connectivity.
You did no research at all. Just spreading FUD because there is a dude you don't like?
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:53:43
Fair enough. Only time will tell if he gets prosecuted or not.
@_date: 2017-11-11 23:44:45
Why can you decide what is right or wrong for other people?
@_date: 2017-11-24 22:40:47
Why should anyone ever pay more than 1sat/byte in tx fees?
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:05:34
Kraken stopped it a while ago because they first need to fix their backend. and advanced order types increased the load on their backend servers.

Are you sure you're not confusing outgoing with incoming connections?
If a node connects with your node, their source port will not be 8333 because that port is already reserved for the listening socket on their end. And this is regardless if their firewall allows incoming connections or not.
If your node connects to a node, their port will be 8333, because that's the port your listening to.
IIRC bitcoind tells you which connections are incoming and which are outgoing.

3... could also be a normal multi-sig address.

FYI: Non-mining nodes do not produce blocks, miners do.  
So if a large majority (80+%) of miners say the blockchain is going THAT way the non-mining nodes may just stop listening. But their blockchain will not advance unless they suddenly activate some serious hashrate and start doing the work that secures and decentralizes the network.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:48:05
But if everyone runs their own node, who uses SPV anymore?
@_date: 2017-10-24 18:22:27
Neither does attacking a person.
One could call you the same names, since you act like you call others. ggwp

Where was that "community" when Blockstream messed us up with their infinite wisdom of high fees, locking up small or spread out assets?

I seem to be a noob at reading then. Can you please show me where and how he was lying? I'm eager to learn the truth, based on facts, not name-calling.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:45:38
Not if you're not using it to mine.
@_date: 2018-02-11 23:51:40
Nodes aren't stopping them, they just plug their ears and scream "CAN'T HEAR YOU - LALALALA".  
Honest miners, producing valid blocks with higher difficulty/effort are the only way to override other blocks and advance the chain.
@_date: 2017-10-25 05:21:43
How does that make someone a hypocrite? Aren't you a hypocrite for calling someone out on the exact thing you're doing?
Have a good day.

If you're calling for civil discussion why not go ahead and stop calling other redditors "being an asshole"and be civil yourself.
Calling name-callers names doesn't solve anything nor does it help anyone, especially not the arguments of either side of the debate.

Well, his answer was quite the educational content by debunking nullc's claims.
Stop attacking people ("who are you? you are nobody") and start an actual argument. For example show us where he's wrong about debunking nullc's claim.
