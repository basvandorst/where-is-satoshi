Yep. Those Rai-money is a super cool example of how "fiat" all currencies are. I've heard the story that even after one of those stones was stolen by the British (?) marines and then drown to the ocean bottom it however still served its purpose just fine.

Yep. Dirty business. When Australian government tried to shut it down Nauru officials loudly protested, arguing that it will cause 100 locals to be unemployed.

I'm always open to absorb the local wisdom. Please, enlighten me.

the purpose of my world's economic articles is to present a short overview of countries' startup ecosystems - not to present my readers with the business plan layout or an ICO white paper.

Theoretically - yes. However, it may raise some issues with the local IRS, which may find it difficult to attribute your tax returns to a particular revenue account. This also may be followed by additional inquiries from their part aimed at your crypto-trading practice. Please, note however, that I'm an international economist and not a tax specialist. For those types of issues you will absolutely need to face your local legal advisors.

I'm trying to provide my readers with a summary of key facts - not conclusions :-)
@_date: 2018-03-13 06:17:10
Precisely :-)

For an intelligent person there's no need to be rude or racist to make his/her point clear to me.

I believe that it's our right and our duty to not shy away from this issue but face up to it and to demonstrate to national governments that their contemporary legal systems must be adapted to the new digital economy (which is far more efficient, productive and socially fair than the existing one) not vice versa.

Thank you for this valuable commentary!

can't disagree. would be ecstatic if you can refer me to the source where I can obtain such type of country-by-country data on crypto-adaption.

Hi CoinCornerMolly! My respect to all of you, guys, who are a real tip of the crypto-spear in EU. Do those people from IOMFSA really open to take local crypto-community's suggestions seriously? If, yes, could you, please, provide me with an example when any of such independently minded proposals was incorporated into the IOM crypto-laws?
