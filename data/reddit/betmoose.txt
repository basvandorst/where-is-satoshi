We have a similar system at BetMoose. Feel free to use our site and read the FAQ for explanation on the calculation. You'll notice our calculation is significantly more fair regarding the weights than bitbet. (Their sky-high multiplier ensures it is almost impossible to make any type of winnings if you're betting late on an event.)

This was one of our first posts in about a month. Trying to help, thanks.

I should have specified "*with brand new equipment". Not sure what calculator you're using, last I checked it's profitable for most to run their miners even with BTC prices as low as $200.

Yes but it's just like a jury in real life - what if they can't come to a consensus, even though the 2 people involved in the contract actually really know what happened? (Example: debatable graphic design work, or debatable outcome based on what was written in how it would be determined, in which something happened afterwards that changed it slightly). If you don't have a central 'judge' to weigh the factors and decide fairly, you just have a mess IMO. 
Also, how are you going to pay all these oracles for their time, especially resolving difficult contracts, and how can that be cheaper or better than a centralized, experienced entity?
btw; for critical mass I mean you need almost 200 or so oracles from different knowledge fields and with experience, that are also available and active to sign into all of this, otherwise it's too risky. I wouldn't trust complete strangers to resolve my contracts for me - though I may trust a single entity with lots of reputation and stake on the line.

Coming from experience with [our site]( (we act as an escrow platform for betting), the issue is the current mentality of 'this random guy on the forum who has been around for the last 6 months' has the same perceived trust as a full-out automated platform with multiple people working full-time on it. You will need to very explicitly compare the options users have for escrow then convince them that using your platform is better. Also, don't expect any traction for awhile, most bitcoiners are very cautious of new bitcoin services, even if built out professionally with a sound business model and good intent. Lastly, start building out reputation of your users so they can link into their bitcointalk profiles, twitter, facebook, real-life identities (and be verified somehow) and then have a very strategic grassroots marketing campaign.

Probably not without a hard fork. And if we're going to hard fork the chain, we got much bigger and better implementations to make, not sure if this one is necessary.

Incorrect - we only take a cut if the player has won something - we always refund 100% if they are unmatched, or matched only against themselves. If a user places 0.5/0.5 (Yes/No), then any another 2 users bets anything on either side, that first player is guaranteed to walk away with a +ve amount if he wins. This is actually something advanced that I don't think our own users fully realize yet - partly because we try our best to simplify things. As an example, have a look at this one:
freedom (who created liquidity in the bet early) cannot lose.

What I meant was it's profitable if you're already mining. Aka if I gave you a free miner right now, it would be wildly profitable for you. The initial cost of them isn't included in the current 'profitability of miners' to sustain the network. Put another way, if you have a miner, you won't be shutting it off until prices dip to less than $200.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:42:44
Not sure why you're getting downvoted.. I think maybe the bitcoin community has given up on this - maybe because they're powerless and their uproar isn't making miners switch away from it? Or maybe because an influx of government agents are trying to take over bitcoin.

We just launched this week; close to ~120 sign ups so far; tracking about 2.5 BTC worth of volume and counting.
Note that we don't act as a 'house' or counter party to the created contracts - our focus is providing a secure, reliable escrow service and a usable exchange platform, in addition to acting as a fail-safe for any disputes.
We also want to grow the prediction community; you can follow our progress on @_date: 2014-06-19 21:29:02

I think 'gambling' has a bad perception - maybe casino style games are 'bad' because you always lose, but if it's skill-based/profit-driven without just pure random luck, then I would call it investing. You should ask him what he thinks a prediction market is :P (betting on the outcome of future events)

**Hang tight - we are almost ready! :)**
At first, it will require a trusted 3rd party (us), however, our eventual goal will be to fully decentralize it. Give us a week or 2, we are doing private alpha right now. I will be sending you a beta invite when it's ready.
Glad there is interest from the community around this!

Did you post a question asking "Is this something I should do?" because you would've gotten a lot of "No"'s to that so don't blame "this place".

We take depression quite seriously that's why advocate skill and smart predictions on our site, not mindless addicting dice throws. Our site technically is an options exchange, so it's not that far off as telling him to invest in stocks. You might be surprised but we've had a positive experience in the past where we converted a depressed casino slots player into a wise oracle on BM, who has been happy with the challenge, felt like he had a purpose and got weened off his addiction to slots.
Remember, we don't act as the house, so it's not like we're trying to outwit the users with an unfavorable situation to them.
Tl;dr: options and other volatile/"gambly" derivatives are perfect for someone who is bored with lack of volatility in their original investment.

Hey bitskeptic - that's like saying 'I'm tired of all the blockchain.info spam, stop posting links to it'. You do realize BetMoose is 100% P2P right? I can promise you there's no coordinated campaign either. It may have something to do with the fact our authors make a small commission from bets, but it could be the fact that our users actually legitimately enjoy the platform.
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:34:17
Or bet on it directly at BetMoose
@_date: 2014-09-12 00:20:55
^ This. I would also say don't go at it alone (I'm assuming OP was). Getting your code reviewed 100 times isn't any good if none of the reviewers have any stake.

@_date: 2014-12-13 22:19:25
Hey dalovndj,
At [BetMoose]( we have what we call the 'distributed resolution system'. The way it works is the author of the contract (a bet or prediction about an uncertain future outcome) is the one who resolves it. The hosts have incentive (they earn a commission) from resolving their bets so 99.6% of our hosts so far have resolved accurately. That said, *all* of our contracts have been paid out correctly, as we also have a dispute resolution system in place if the host doesn't resolve, or resolves incorrectly. We also have a reputation system in place.
The way the dispute system works is all payouts are delayed by [currently] 24 hours, which gives time to any user to report a bet for 'incorrect resolution'. If any reports are received, the payout is paused and our moderators get involved.
This is similar to the PayPal model where payments are distributed and PayPal only gets involved when there's a dispute. 
Would love to hear your thoughts on this.
@_date: 2014-06-21 04:13:38
If you really want to be technical about it, it's 2.4% of that specific contract as that host is level 1 (0.6% commission). Note that it's still a low cut for us, and we only take it if it's resolved, otherwise everyone gets everything back. If you'd like to propose a different solution I'd love to hear it. Or even better, we'll make our site free but you're paying for our servers, CDN, and cold-storage RAID array. 
@_date: 2014-08-15 00:12:41
If they're paying in $$$ then they'll never get 'true' bitcoiners and thus their study will be voided. If anything, they should offer a CHOICE between BTC and USD, that's research in itself!
@_date: 2014-09-07 16:15:24
Technically speaking, no. Practically, yes. It depends on what kind of impact you're talking about. Development would not be hindered but adoption may be.
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:52:18
What if we made our platform free? What would your opinion be then? Would you be interested and actually place some bets yourself?
@_date: 2014-09-18 17:16:59
This is exactly the inspiration that went into creating BetMoose. You might be thinking "yeah well BetMoose holds the coin and takes a fee." Both are true: though we only take a relatively small 2-3% and give almost half of that back to our hosts (creators of contracts), and affiliates. The benefit however is it creates incentive for us to run the domain, the servers, any support/questions, and most importantly, marketing to bring people together and create more action on all events. There's no such thing as 'free' so even if you base it on a blockchain concept you'll be paying some type of miner to process transactions. As for holding coins, we hate doing it but it's necessary to properly resolve contracts. Any other Oracle system has much greater inherent risks and flaws than a company dedicated to securely escrowing contracts. If you're interested in more discussion, head on over to our subreddit and start a topic there, will be happy to chat. @_date: 2014-06-17 17:26:11

Hey Amichateur,
Adam here, just catching up on this thread. AFAIK when the site went down it's when his monthly server wasn't paid for I guess, so if you didn't get it out within a month of his disappearance, then yeah it's lost for good. I remember seeing some links to instructions of how to get coins out on their subreddit:  
As for this identity sillyness - basically, some of our co-founders, myself included, are paranoid lol. Reason being is we DO have access to coins and feel that is a liability, so we are adopting what we call the 'btc-e' model. We realize that some people do not like how btc-e operates, but we like it, and believe it's better to operate in that way. I can totally understand the reluctance to trust an organization you can't tie to a person, so that's your call. FYI though, Alex, one of our co-founders, and who does NOT have access to any coins, will be speaking likely later this month or next at the weekly Toronto Bitcoin Meetup. There is a difference of 'being known' and 'existing'. If you have any other specific questions you want to take off reddit, feel free to email me personally, adam[at]betmoose.com
Hopefully you will join our growing community in the future, you'll find we are 100x what betsofbitco.in was.

"Pushing a site" - I wish.. we make 2% of bets - we're in this for the data and prediction powers, not some measily 0.02 off of 1 BTC of volume. Knowing the future is much more valuable to us.

Again, we only have this one PR account here, and if you check its activity, you'll find it hasn't been repeating anything on this subreddit. I think the OP was referring to the news posts/submitted bets by our users, in which case I have to disagree with 'repetition' because our mods remove duplicates on our site also. Them sharing their predictions here is no different than the 'X said price to be $800 next week' threads if you think about it.

We thought about that. But since all our bets are pooled, the aggregation of funds happens within a single contract, not site-wide. Good point though.

That's right but I never said anything about it being -EV... 
Again - we do not profit from him placing a bet, in fact, nothing happens at all. EV is 0 until there's a market for it. Once a market forms, his EV is ambiguous, even in the long-term.
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:44:39
Maybe this has something to do with the 51% Ghash is approaching... government wants to cash out before the impending dooooomm!
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:38:16
Imagine a world where every prediction is backed up by some kind of financial gain or loss. Do you think we'll have better or worse information about markets at that point? I have nothing personal against the OP but my point stands - anyone can pump and dump with words, which creates volatility, and a lot of alt-coin models are based on this. If you introduce some type of 'credibility' (aka even the slightest amount of cost), you reduce this significantly, and you get a much clearer picture. 
Obviously we do want absolutely everyone to be placing 'bets' on their expectations, not because it makes us 2-2.5% commission, but because we'll be much better at predicting the future. So far, our site predicted the Ghash.io reaching 51% before it reached 51% and I'm much more proud of that then the measly 0.0168 BTC we've made in commissions from that.
Hopefully you share our vision.
@_date: 2014-06-17 22:44:41

@_date: 2014-09-23 01:58:06
You might be interested in our platform. You can create fixed-odds and parimutuel bets, and we have quite a few about the BTC price: 
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:23:32
Yes. People are more reluctant to spend coin when the value of it (currently seen by most as its worth in USD) decreases. Why? Because they're expecting it to recover/bounce back and thus be worth more later.

Nope, just my opinion, hence why I said 'that's my guess'. I'm not sure if mining == bitcoin though; so far, we're okay. Maybe someone is creating something epic to decentralize mining as we speak?
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:31:48
It can and some already think it does. Hence the fear of 'whales' and those with lots of coins.
That said, the distribution of wealth in BTC is much more than with fiat (more rich people hold more wealth in fiat, while in BTC not as much), so it's seen as more equitable.
One (or a number of) parties could buy up BTC but it would raise the price and increase the wealth of the other holders, unlike with fiat, where you can get more fiat without enriching others (in fact, the opposite)

Hey Tim,
Not sure if launched projects count (we launched last week) but betmoose is actively in development with two working full time and even getting paid in bitcoin.

Check us out and PM me if you'd like to do an interview :)
@_date: 2014-06-10 15:13:32
Are you sure you mean to say decentralized and not 'P2P'. Have a look at betmoose.com (just launched), we have a 2-tiered resolution system that helps resolve (and prevent false or rigged resolutions) of real world events that only humans could judge. The blockchain is nice but there's only so much you can do when it comes to connecting it to real life.

Just wanted to point out Mr Bitcorn never took me up on my bet, so he couldn't have been too serious
@_date: 2014-05-31 16:33:13
Okay so can you clarify - are these dedicated spaces (or 'stores' that sell mining equipment) that you want to open? Or are you planning on using existing retail outlets and add a counter or something to them? 
Are you sure you're not allowed to sell bitcoin outright? Why can Wal-Mart sell Facebook credits gift cards? 
If you're still marketing it as a 'something something......place to trade....something something', how does that change anything about fincen rules?

There was a story the other week of someone who claims this happened to them - they were just dumbfounded and took the paper wallets he was carrying, nothing else interesting happened.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:27:21
What do you want to do exactly? Lots of people want smart contracts when what they want can't actually be done with them, unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-09-18 18:49:42
FYI BetMoose does not arbitrate - the users resolve their own bets within the incentivized P2P system. We act as the dedicated escrow and only step in for any resolution disputes. Pretty close to a truly distributed contract system. If something comes out that would allow us to not hold coins (aka not require anyone to trust us), we'll be the first to jump on it. 
The issue we found in practice is exchanges need volume so using alt-coins that are capable of this would not work as there is simply no one using them (not to mention their blockchains are insecure). Just like how for the next 20+ years/forseeable future, land-based casinos with significantly more house edge will still be more popular than the technically superior bitcoin gambling ones. Why? Because you still need to go out to people with money (marketing) who want to bet and say 'hey come to our shiny renovated casino and we'll serve you free drinks'. That measly 1-2%, even 5% off from your $1000 of winnings is negligible when you consider the entertainment experience. Other practical proof of this? Government taxes, especially in some euro countries, taking almost 50% of your income. People still stay and still love it.
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:45:30
ITT: please everyone stop mining so I can make more
@_date: 2014-06-17 23:10:50
No actually, you can have the day price on exchanges be $600 but the coins can sell for $700 or $500/btc no problem
@_date: 2014-06-14 20:56:02
Yeah, you'll probably find a lot of funny ones eventually - anyone can host anything they want (for free) - as you can tell, no one is biting on that one! :)
Also; you get your bet back 100% if no one bets against you; hence why some still bet on *GoT SPOILER ALERT:* 'No'.
@_date: 2014-08-10 18:02:23
1. You're talking about 'confirmed' transactions. Payment processors like bitpay take unconfirmed transactions, no one has to stand around waiting for a block confirmation. For bigger purchases, yes you will need to wait ~1 hour if someone wants 6 confirmations. Compare that to 5+ business days for bank clears, more if it's international. In addition, many websites, including ours ( have innovated to accept 0-conf deposits and built their systems with this in mind to reduce the risk of any double spends.
2. Transaction fees. Mining is still profitable at current rates with NEW tech (the reason why people complain about mining being unprofitable is because since it was profitable earlier, everyone jumped in at the same time, thus increasing difficulty and making a lot of what they bought obsolete. This created a negative ROI for most miners that didn't scale with the difficulty increases).
3. Right now Bitcoin can easily handle 4-5x the current capacity with 0 changes. If we need more, it'll be coded in and scale just fine don't worry. Scales better than communism ;)
4. Most people ARE NOT content, but it so happens that MOST miners care more about short-term profit than long-term bitcoin sustainability. Others just want a 51% attack to happen so the core devs make a fork and fix it once and for all.
Hope that helps!

If you want bitcoin, buy it. There's no such thing as free money - if you buy this yes there is a chance it'll pay off, but a much larger chance it won't and you'll actually lose money.

It's P2P and distributed (you create and resolve your own bets/predictions), so yes, we've seen ones even crazier than that! It's a pretty much free platform (we take 2-3%) so if you ever want a good escrow for your crazy ideas, drop by! :)

Yes I am very familiar with the regulations going on in the US. What I don't get is how you are planning on running this as a franchise, sub-leasing from other [retail] spaces.. or how the 'meet up' model will be integrated with the 'selling mining equipment' model. I feel like you have something here but I'm confused with the marketing of it. I think you're trying the starbucks model right? Sell coffee but be known as the 'meetup place'? If so, that's interesting - but you don't even need to sell anything specific. You can still have a retail space without a purpose of selling things AFAIK; selling mining equipment could just be one of the things behind the cash/bitcoin POS register. 
Just trying to understand.
FYI in Toronto we have the Bitcoin Decentral - it is a 2 floor building downtown where the top floor is a co-working environment for bitcoin startups, and the bottom floor is empty, though they have an ATM down there and hold weekly meetups. I sort of like this model, and believe these 'chapters' is what we need in all major areas. Is this something you are trying to accomplish essentially?

As others have mentioned, instead of looking for investors at this point, you should be looking for a team. The 'investment' is the time from a fellow developer who may believe in this idea. Be prepared to go 50/50 with them on this. Once it's a realized app, then you go seek investment (if needed).

Hey team fairlay; I wouldn't use 'smart contracts' to define what we do - it's really not fair to actual smart contract providers.

What the other guy said - your name, BTC address and email are exposed. This is actually a huge issue if you're using a web wallet that uses email for 2FA. A bot could scan every BTC address you specify and if you have an amount worth stealing, they'll start trying to socially engineer every web-wallet that may have your email on file. 
If you like the site, I'd send them a friendly email demanding that form be https'd.

I think some assumptions here are warranted - if you are a site admin, why else would you just stop everything? Not logging in, not checking the site, not stealing coins, etc. What could have possibly happened in his life besides him falling gravely ill/dying? No one knew the guy personally but it's a logical conclusion. 
As for upvote/downvotes - no idea, (none of those were from this account), but my guess is the calling out the site as a 'scam' without any reason to. Being cautious is one thing, calling new startups a scam based on no logical reason is another.

I think we're on the same page then BBBTTTCC and you're misunderstanding what BetMoose is about. The dangerous gambling usually involves a suspenseful luck-roll or choice, with the player hoping for the best (same way lottery tickets work) based on randomness. 
With BetMoose, our users invest into future outcomes, based on logic, reason, and speculation. Then there's usually multiple days that nothing happens (no immediate, reassuring reward), and only at the outcome is there a payout or loss. Some users may create futures contracts as hedges of their underlying security that they may hold. 
We advocate these types of smart investment practices and don't actually want to be associated with the gambling you speak of. In fact, right on our front page, we write "There's no dice here." for a reason.
That said, we do want to promote a P2P environment, so we allow users to create whatever they wish. It's up to them, and the true dice-rollers will realize we're not the platform for them. 
Cheers mate
@_date: 2014-08-08 21:30:29
Here's a rough draft of random reasons off the top of my head:
1. Something new, as a hobby. Learn about things you may have never known about before (mining, cryptography, economics, law, philosophy?). Stare at blockchain.info to experience value transfer in real time - some people really like it, especially if you like stock markets or other data streaming live. 
2. Buy it as a store of value - although it is currently inflationary, you know for a fact it is mathematically limited to 21M so it's deflationary long-term, sorta like gold except you know exactly what that finite limit is, and that no one is 'hiding' random excess supply since it's all publicly tracked in the blockchain.
3. Buy it as a speculative investment, might take off more than it already has (but has risks, invest what you can afford to lose)
4. Use it to create new, innovative services, tech, products that may otherwise have been impossible with fiat currencies. Shameless plug: check out  - what we do is impossible to do with fiat (instant, anonymous bets with anyone, globally, no limits, conditions or restrictions (and legal!)).
5. Use it as a payment network. Are you going overseas or need to send money to someone there? Can do so instantly and for free (technically 6 cents), any amount. No limits or middle-men clearing things. Plus, you can carry it through an airport on a USB stick.
6. Use it to hide certain financial activities - maybe you're going through a rough divorce. Don't want to lose all your assets/get them seized by a court? Bitcoin!
7. Political Reasons: Maybe you are tired of funding your government's actions and wars with their money, use this money instead.

Place something down on it then I'll believe you (after I bet against you on a $3000 coin)
@_date: 2014-08-08 20:12:01
No as in the author of the bet, (the 'host') controls the resolution. Our mods can't touch resolutions unless someone else reports it (goes through our 'dispute process'). The only thing mods can do upfront is cancel bets. 
The coin control is a different issue altogether, and trust us, we don't WANT to hold people's coins. We're using Bitcoin (and thus holding it because no other tech exists within BTC that allows us to do what we do) because that's what everyone wants to use and feels comfortable using. When there's more of a market in the other protocols (or something built within bitcoin), we'll be the first to adopt it. The 'smart contract' thing can only be used for pre-programmed purposes, and we can't pre-program everything.
Please get in touch via PM if you have other ideas, we'd love to hear it.

Yes, the easiest workaround is to just use blockchain.info. Remember, you can receive payments without any worry, just the sending bit can be (in theory) tracked.
@_date: 2014-09-26 17:10:41
You forgot a pretty major point: you can use it on services that are either superior to fiat (provably fair gambling), or on services that cannot be done with fiat in the first place (betmoose.com - anonymous p2p betting where you're allowed to make a contract about anything and there are no limits or restrictions). When smart contracts become a reality (and other blockchain-based services), it would become superior to many legal establishments like copyright monopolies, and small-claims and enforcing of contracts between parties. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 00:46:36

Someone on our team got halfway through building this. You should do some history research on TorBroker and 1Broker (both are CFD). As I'm also sure you're aware, you need to ideally be located where there are low or no capital gains tax, otherwise you'll need to pass on the cap gains tax to the user (which must be done otherwise you're running a bucket shop (much more illegal)). If you do that though, you may find yourself in a not-so-friendly jurisdiction.

If it's decentralized, it has to be automated with a solution magnitudes cheaper than the other variants (which should be easy since some sportsbooks approach 25% cut), and with limited attack vectors. 
I agree if you can manage to somehow automate sports feeds, based on an automated network consensus, that would be cool, and I would use that. 
But it gets much harder when you're talking about settling contracts between real people on real things that automated systems can't figure out. Maybe one day, when we have AI... that's a whole different story! :P

Hi Reddit,
My name is Adam King and I'm the co-founder and CEO of BetMoose. I'll be around for the next few hours to answer any questions and take on your feedback. We have a very open and forward-thinking team here in Canada so feel free to propose anything - we'll try our best to integrate it into BetMoose. Please also join us at so we can keep everything in one place!
Here's the run-down of what BetMoose is about:

Because they don't think about it that way. They don't care about 'faking' their hash power or moving it around because they're just focused on being the largest and best (could actually be helping their brand too, by being the largest and most socially 'accepted' pool)
That's my guess anyway
@_date: 2014-09-27 19:45:06
What we're thinking is creating a betting/crowdfunding hybrid so tournaments/teams will be able to schedule their games and create the events as bets. Any wagers placed by outside viewers can go towards the market but the team could get 10% of the bet volume on their side. We could pull the scores live and stream the game straight on our bet pages which are already setup for this. That's why we're looking forward to work together with leetcoin as they can focus on the tournaments and we focus on the secondary/outside spectator market. Thoughts?

This. If they operate their CS anything like most of the other bitcoin sites, then it means their hot wallet is low and has to be refilled. Most likely some large whale just pulled out a large amount from them. If this is happening continuously though then it is a bad sign (see: MtGox).
What IS weird is that you say it's happening to multiple coins at once.

It's coming. ;) 
Power of bitcoin. Welcome to the revolution of ideas and contracts.
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:15:01
~35BTC wagered total so far, 250 users, slowly building the moose oracle community! Our dev focus is fixed-odds right now, we're expecting a few market-maker partnerships in the coming month when we go-live with it. When we introduce fixed-odds, it will essentially allow anyone to run a book (on anything, not just sports) using BetMoose with the power and flexibility of bitcoin. Pretty exciting stuff, thanks for asking! :)
@_date: 2014-06-25 05:10:00
AFAIK this doesn't exist, because people could easily create super-smart AI bots to beat you. I thought of this as well earlier; thread here: 
@_date: 2014-06-18 08:16:11
Yeah. That's where we're at now kinda.. a lot of people were already expecting moon or full demise actually if you look back at threads from 2011-2013.
I doubt we'll just 'settle' at $1000 though as we have so many developers working on everything and generally have a growing market (if you look at pretty much any trends) so this stuff isn't slowing down anytime soon.
@_date: 2014-09-29 08:51:53
This part was legit:
@_date: 2014-06-14 21:27:32
Yup - already done on our demo server!
We're planning to deploy a big push of improvements tomorrow.

You're saying it'll set the market price on exchanges, which it won't.$18m is a lot but it's not enough to sway all the exchanges and their order books
@_date: 2014-06-08 16:39:22
Correct. Think of 'double spend' more of as 'reversal'
@_date: 2014-06-23 18:08:30
What's the public key for anyway?
@_date: 2014-06-17 16:55:42
But the question is, what does the market do ahead of time, or right before and after the auction. Serious whales can be dumping right ahead of the auction, OR be buying up THEN dumping to try and get the people at auction paying the highest possible, then not letting them sell since there'll be a delay between the auction and getting those coins to an exchange.

Lol let's just agree to disagree :)
Direct/indirect comes from costs normally in accounting, this whole 'directly profit' thing is all abstract in technical terms anyway 
This is a PR account so I changed your label to 'pretty smart guy - don't argue unless you have lots of time', hopefully that informs anyone else on our team who may cross paths with you later :P
@_date: 2014-06-13 03:47:06
You may be really interested in [our new platform (click)](
You can structure this as 2 separate bets and you'll see what people REALLY think when they put down real coin on it.
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:32:19
There you go - see, you don't understand the platform. We do not take fees for unmatched bets! So no, we do not 'directly' profit from it. We 'indirectly' profit from it because it creates a potential market.

You should put some coin behind this prediction and contribute towards making it a reality :)
@_date: 2014-06-19 06:42:55
Ugh not this s*** again. 
I suggest people start selling coins when they get close to 50 - if they're really 'pro bitcoin' and 'rely on bitcoin' then they'll back off since they'll lose more in the price fall than the extra revenue from more blocks.
..If they're not pro bitcoin, then consider yourself lucky you got your fiat out in time.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:32:42
What happens if bitcoin goes to $0? The difference between using homes as collateral or cars is because someone somewhere will still need to buy land or transportation at some point and as such you have a 'minimum'. Bitcoin doesn't have a 'minimum'. Bitcoin has value because people think it has value, hence the "bitcoin has no intrinsic value" arguments - yes the technology is powerful and the infrastructure but there's really nothing stopping everyone to immediately jumping to another SHA256 coin that fixes something that may be broken with Bitcoin - or Google coming around and saying 'Here's a coin for the world' and running it decentralized - just for branding purposes, but also saying they're going to accept it with Google Wallet and partnering with a few exchanges to turn it back into fiat... 
@_date: 2014-09-18 22:44:29
Who holds the coin for a contract, are you going to multi-sig it between x trusted oracles? Or are you thinking about a different approach?

This may be your last chance to capitalize on this bet someone made earlier this week (I have a feeling it'll resolve early...):
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:40:57
Thanks for the mention! 
Just so you know, we have this over at  the users create AND resolve the bets, and if there's any disputes, our admins have 24hrs to get to it. If they don't, the bet is auto-cancelled and all funds are returned. This prevents what happened to betsofbitco.in, and is a valid concern+risk with the other one-point-of-failure sites (not just prediction markets).
We'll also be publishing this code for public audit once we finish with our core features.
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:06:14
Nope - I just have a theory that people who say 'gambling is bad' will always say 'gambling is bad' regardless, even if they have no reason to, or even if what they are talking about isn't even gambling in the first place ;)
Case in point - you haven't replied about it being free, which means you clearly still have a negative outlook on us. A rational mind would say 'yes then I will be accepting of this service you offer, and I will see it fair and reasonable for you to solicit users to create wagers and predictions in an open market, as it is value-added in the economy'.
@_date: 2014-06-17 17:09:20
I suggested a plan that would affect them in another thread:
@_date: 2014-06-15 18:57:32
Why is this just coming out now? This was released March 25th - where was it this week when everyone was panicking?
@_date: 2014-06-20 01:55:23
Oh, sorry to hear that then :(
If you don't mind me asking, where did you get your 0.08 BTC from?
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:23:45
I never said it was a losing bet - he can easily be right and win it. It was more of a challenge, that he accepted (good for him, and I'm sure we'll be posting an update in August). The bet will be placed in an open market for all to bet on (not me specifically). We take our site fee regardless if he loses or wins (except if no one bets against him, in which case we don't), so it's not him specifically we benefit from, nor his bet - we benefit from having a market; this was his introduction into it. No, I do not see anything unethical about running a prediction market in this way. 
TL;DR: Not necessarily a losing bet, and no, not directly profit from either.
@_date: 2014-07-21 07:24:41
*high five*!
Just wait till we add fixed-odds; they're coming!
Also coming is a market maker; 100 BTC+ of mouth-watering liquidity and competitive sports odds; we've asked for better than the other BTC sportsbooks and they said 'very likely'. 
@_date: 2014-09-17 17:35:19
How about using fiat as the funding method, and bitcoin as the denomination? That's what we're expanding into with BetMoose, lots of legalese and regs to deal with though

What's the concern and maybe I can help you? What BobAlison posted below is the pdf you can read through if you want to get into the technical bits. FYI it's not illegal anywhere to use or relay or broadcast bitcoin, and if you're worried about being found out if you have a lot of coins, just tumble them to another address (send a bunch of coins to an exchange or any web-wallet, then to a new address you generate on your local machine).
@_date: 2014-09-27 03:00:43
Yes, here are some: 
@_date: 2014-09-24 18:48:16
We actually have a market maker that will be coming on board once we launch a dedicated sportsbook interface and API for our sports fans out there. If you sign up we'll send an email when it's ready. Till then, we're letting our users run the markets as we want to remain solvent with no risk of going bust to one or two users who bet correctly (even at bad odds). If you're interested in making markets (we have a competitive (read: almost free) plan that we'll be putting our initial market makers on), please reach out directly!
@_date: 2014-06-16 04:54:39
Maybe... Why not start some kind of peer-to-peer resource where scientist can do crowd-funded research for bitcoin, or get paid in BTC for submitting answers for diseases that the public can ask about - like webMD but more personal?
@_date: 2014-06-18 16:43:06
I'd start by posting this over at bitcointalk.org in the mining section
@_date: 2014-07-01 15:31:52
This would make every store an atm technically.. even if you limit it to $100 back. Would be good though if you're spending bitcoin but know you'll need a little cash later

This is extremely sketchy. What is the company? If it's something unheard of, I would report it to the authorities. Feel free to PM me personally, we can set up something encrypted, and I'll do it for you. 
Are they also paying you 'something quite surprisingly high' for an exec assistant? Be VERY careful.

They would have to deal with it less than whatever they charge (ie, less than 1% of the time). Within our platform, we haven't had any double-spend attacks yet (been only 2 months for us though). Good question!

You should share the advantages of bitcoin with people that could benefit from it. There's quite a few services that use bitcoin to do cool stuff where fiat money wouldn't work.

We've been finding that people, in *aggregate*, CAN predict prices with semi-reliable accuracy. Check out some of the resolved bets filtered by the bitcoin category. Usually the side with most volume wins.
@_date: 2014-09-25 01:20:39
That was meant as two separate sentences sorry: a market maker will add *liquidity*, which we will need when we launch a dedicated sportsbook expansion. When launched, there will be action on all major U.S. sport markets. Exchanges are good as they allow anyone to back or lay outcomes, meaning you will get the fairest odds. Our site takes 2% fee on lays, and 3% on backs (though we share that with the creator of the contracts) - so if you create your own events, you can actually make money off of them with BetMoose if you get your friends to bet against each other (allows you to run your own book). 
@_date: 2014-06-30 14:40:41
That's how you do it actually! If anyone else bets on either side, he will win more than he puts in. We're P2P so we don't have unfavourable 'spread odds' - he'll get his own coin back from the other side.
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:06:57
Right now betmoose uses what's known as 'parimutuel' betting where the odds depend on what everyone else bets (though it's possible to control your own odds also). The total cut is 3% which is shared between the site and the host (author) of the bet. We're working on fixed-odds as a bet type right now so if you sign up we'll send an email when it's done (maybe a week or two!) 
@_date: 2014-06-13 08:37:00

Way to support new bitcoin startups in the community. Did you know we're the first distributed P2P betting exchange? Or that you can make commissions from creating your own bets? Or do you just downvote everything with the word 'bet' in it?
@_date: 2014-06-25 03:13:09
Actually; this is exactly what BetMoose is perfect for. As soon as a 'bet' starts to approach a high sample size, you can almost guarantee its accuracy. You should understand how prediction markets and wisdom of crowds work - there's nothing emotional or bad about it.
@_date: 2014-08-23 17:35:11
Localbitcoins/mycelium. Don't feed centralization.
@_date: 2014-09-04 19:18:38
 is a p2p betting site - you can create your own events (eg: NFL). Because it's p2p, it is significantly more efficient to bet there. Also, you can deposit and withdraw instantly, and we pay your miner fees.

If you're interested in a betting exchange where you can choose your own odds/bet against other people, check out  - we have quite a few NFL bets going on already. 
@_date: 2014-06-13 01:28:08
That's more than I'd be willing to wager! It's a pooled bet anyway, you bet as much as you can/want to, there's no 'house' counter party and you don't pay anything if it goes unmatched.
@_date: 2014-06-20 06:19:50
Give it a day to wait for contact. If no contact received, report back! 
Also - I wouldn't buy bitcoin from gambling companies.. Maybe it works but you'll definitely never get it as cheap as a dedicated exchange or other provider. I know with [BetMoose]( we are planning to offer this functionality in the future as well but we'll just be selling you our own bitcoin we have, or otherwise buying direct from a miner or exchange at what most likely will be unfavourable rates for you.
@_date: 2014-06-19 07:08:34

If you give me your IP I might be able to give you some insight (maybe PM just in case)
@_date: 2014-09-07 20:42:35
Betsofbitco.in was run by a single individual in the early days of bitcoin and he never ran away with funds (coins sitting in their original deposit addresses to this day). Rumor is he died or otherwise forgot about things. BetMoose is run by a team, with real personalities known by those especially in the Toronto bitcoin community. We've also built a robust system that eliminates most of the scenarios seen in the bitcoin space previously. 
@_date: 2014-08-11 23:54:52
3. Such a massive jump won't happen overnight. If Amazon did accept Bitcoin it doesn't mean everyone using amazon will use BTC. And yes as someone else said, Amazon would probably choose to use an off-chain processor like bitpay.
4. Yes, it bothers most of us quite a bit actually. Not so much JUST because of a double-spend, but because it makes bitcoin centralized, and for the party that controls majority of the network, it's easier to stay in control, assuming it's 100% their hardware. This is why Ghash at 51% isn't a HUGE deal because many miners would in fact jump off their ship if an attack or malicious intent ever formed.
@_date: 2014-06-30 22:46:43
It honestly doesn't move THAT much. It just jumped today because of the auction, if you look last month it was pretty quiet. I wouldn't hold it if volatility scares you but the benefits you're going to get using it for gambling should wildly outweigh the potential 10% you may lose (or gain!) while having it. 
@_date: 2014-07-01 16:12:12

I do believe you can probably buy out coindesk for less than $1M. It's frankly not thatttt big compared to many independent news sites. It may seem larger to you as you are a bitcoiner who frequents and sees a lot of news from it. 
A better deal might be to buy cryptocoinnews which is more up and coming. It really depends what the strategy is. Brainwashing and propaganda don't work as well unless you control all the media content (aka North Korea). 
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:40:53
Yeah, let's hope the population at large gets more into cryptos and realizes the benefits of them + starts adopting and actively following stuff like this. We have big hopes (but pessimistic expectations) of the Ethereum project. Our team here unanimously believe that although all of the decentralized applications would be possible, few will unfortunately adopt them as we haven't personally heard the word 'trustless' until we started being involved with bitcoin, and never really saw a need for it either when we were within the existing legal structure the world runs on (though we clearly saw other benefits which is why we're here now :)). What we need is a cultural change from 'I will sue you if you run away with my money' to 'You can't run away with my money'. Most uninformed folks don't understand how this can be possible, and even many bitcoiners don't (see mt gox and other scams). Other stuff like wagering is just not possible in a trustless fashion with bitcoin, hence our hope for Ethereum's success and general uptake.

Are you new or do you know someone in the BTC world? There are lots of affiliate programs and even [BetMoose]( allows you to host bets for free, earning commissions from the bet pot - but it helps if you can share it with others who have/can wager BTC.

Hey SBG,
You can create your own offers and bets. Instant anonymous deposits and payouts are available if you use the parimutuel betting mode. Anonymous deposits within fixed-odds bets is not available until there is more exchange volume. That said, accounts are free and you only need to provide an email address. Let us know if you have any feedback!
@_date: 2014-09-05 08:38:04
You and your friends can actually bet directly againt each other using bitcoin now with our site;  Because it's P2P we have one of the lowest fees around since we don't act as the house, you do! Oh and you can do it instantaneously and anonymously. Welcome to bitcoin! :)

I've sent you ~$1.20 (0.002 BTC). Hope that helps. 
I hope you have in fact learned that drugs and casinos are bad. Do something good in your community and turn yourself into a better person, good luck!

I think BetMoose solves a lot of these problems without introducing any new ones. Coincidentally, we've launched today:
TL;DR: We do a 2-party verification process with 'real people' (hosts) that are then validated by anyone participating in the contract and have a fail-safe (our moderators) in case of any disputes. 
@_date: 2014-06-19 23:21:36
When you propose a new one - you're also welcome to come over to  and propose a new banner for us :P

@_date: 2014-06-25 03:11:07
I respect that - here:
@_date: 2014-08-03 22:43:41
Not all. Some. We are [BetMoose.COM]( Mintpal, a cryptocurrency exchange uses .com, as does cryptsy, as well as many others that were pointed out here. I think .com is more popular with websites that target people not already involved with bitcoin, just a theory.
@_date: 2014-07-12 02:19:48
If you're into parimutuel, try  - we'll be adding fixed-odds soon though!
@_date: 2014-11-05 20:51:37
Sounds exactly like [BetMoose]( except we don't do multisig.. yet!
@_date: 2014-06-13 19:43:46
Check out betmoose.com, we're a user-friendly version of this. It allows anyone to create pooled contacts (we call them bets). You'll get the idea once you visit the site. Note that we hold the coin and act as a trusted fail-safe in case our oracles fail, whereas this trusts a group of anonymous oracles to reach consensus. Pros and cons to each, hope that helps! 
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:17:31
How is that spam..? It's a valid prediction market that we're trying to reveal the true % likely outcome with by using the [Wisdom of the Crowd]( theories. Did you even look at it? It's not some casino gambling dice game where they're guaranteed to lose 50% of the time...
@_date: 2014-06-19 03:25:05
I think this already exists/would exist very quickly if pirate bay actually got taken down. It's just cheaper and easier for them to pay $10/yr per parked domain and keep it centralized while promoting artists, selling shirts, and posting new info (which is what they already have). Why bother doing the extra work to decentralize when it's working fine now? :P
@_date: 2014-06-09 17:48:35
Thanks, and yes this is the first official public posting

This looks sketchy to me.. can you not post it all in CODE, and link your logo after you write 'neural networks to analyze past bitcoin transactions' lol I was expecting some awesome graphs and proof. 
Also your website is a 1 pager with no validity or theory behind it whatsoever. Looks like scam/vaporware to me sorry.
@_date: 2014-09-08 22:08:08
You can also run your own bets on LoL (and any other eSport) using [BetMoose]( We just rolled out this functionality today and we definitely need more eSport gamers! Going to message leetcoin and see if they want to integrate somehow, the more bettors in one place, the merrier! I think Bitcoin and eSports have a bright future together.
@_date: 2014-06-19 20:15:13
Interesting thoughts - do you foresee a lot of big companies taking on bitcoin with web-wallets which most people will use and thus most transactions becoming off-chain completely, thereby not only placing trust in those major companies but also losing out on paying the whatever small transaction fee you would pay to a miner actually supporting the underlying network?
*cough* ..run-on sentence :P

Don't forget - bitcoin has value if me and you think it has value. There's nothing a 3rd party can do to influence that. That's what made bitcoin take off to where it is now, don't go backwards into your cage.

This could work but I would edit the marketing plan.. 
First of all, focus on doing this as a crypto-cafe approach, free and open to all, not anything specific like 'mining equipment' as you have on your demo site. Just a place anyone can do anything crypto related. Your profits will probably be made from advertising or promos. (You can still sell mining equipment but it shouldn't be THE model).
Second, I didn't read everything but this should start off with existing retail or cafe/meeting locations. In fact, anyone with 'space' should be part of this, then you put their 'space' on the map for others to find. They get foot traffic into their spaces so it benefits them.
I don't have a space but if you're looking for more directors/bus dev managers, I'm in Toronto - msg me.
@_date: 2014-09-05 16:28:38
Should note that it doesn't apply to all sites, eg: BetMoose manages our addresses in such a way that we would never be affected by this. 
@_date: 2014-06-25 04:12:03
True - guess it was by your tone and quick scan of your post history that I came to that:


Gambling is low hanging fruit, I'd much rather see more things with positive impact in the Bitcoin eco system and more creativity
Which made me add a label to you which primed me to use that connotation. Our team has worked hard on BetMoose and we really believe this to be an innovative, unique, non-gambly or misery-inducing thing that we are planning to grow and test in the bitcoin space to later bring over into the fiat world.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:19:06
No but this is a great idea for our sub, - it's already a predictions site, maybe each prediction from media, VIPs, etc could be a bet and we can track how well it does since everything is hosted transparently on our site.. PM me maybe you could be a mod.

Seems like free open wifi hotspots would be much easier and quicker to enable. Otherwise you're essentially aiming to take on a massive infrastructure project for what? I have encrypted messaging already, good enough for me! Also, AFAIK the spectrum is limited and governments control what can be aired and where. 
@_date: 2014-08-08 17:42:19
What do you call options trading then? You either get a big payout, or you lose your initial stake. 'Gambling' is such a blanket word, there are really so many different variables and factors to consider. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 22:03:36
Off-chain transactions.
@_date: 2014-02-23 20:23:27
Why not post "It isn't necessary to wait for confirmations for a purchase." instead of what you said? Or does it make you feel better that you know something about confirmations the OP doesn't? Unless you like being branded an 'elitist' and pushing people away from this community, you should change your attitude, it applies to all of us unfortunately.
@_date: 2014-09-18 19:49:30
What's the point of these 'predictions'? Put some coin behind it! I'll give you 0.01 that it will NOT go below $400 within the next 24 hours. Also, some people don't think it'll go below $400 in September at all:

Them not giving you a contact protects them and their users from potential attacks; anyone including hackers trying to socially-engineer their accounts or service providers, governments enacting new laws saying that what Kraken does is now against some law somewhere and all of the users' millions of dollars is now their governments, and from spam in case of a simple maintenance issue.
In any case, please post more detailed proof and records, what you just said doesn't really raise any red flags for me.

No you're not the only one. In fact, the current prediction is 50/50, and others have put down coin behind their thoughts: 
@_date: 2016-01-23 03:53:35
There have been options for awhile now, eg: 
We've resolved hundreds of bets that were created by individuals who challenged (and won or lost) against others. The platforms are there; I think you might be referring to a reddit bot, which would be cool indeed, but very niche. We've considered it before but it's hard to commit to the development of such bot as there's a poor return on investment here. It's easy enough to hotlink to BetMoose and deposit anonymously as is. 
If anyone wants to partner with us to develop such bot, we would be interested.
@_date: 2014-12-04 03:55:04
You sound like one of our affiliates lol! If you're not, you should be! You just described our platform and commission structure, with the ability to create empty bets about anything. Just a note: from our past experience, most people don't like to be the first to bet.
@_date: 2014-08-14 16:14:12
They should have put money on it. Otherwise it's just words anyone can write for MAYBE-fame. Maybe I should make 100 websites all predicting random things, one of those will be right and I'll get a little bit of fame right? For the serious prophets out there, there's [BetMoose](
@_date: 2014-06-10 17:11:13
The plan is to mitigate that risk so that if the resolution system fails (aka the site goes down), any deposited coins are automatically sent back - this prevents what happened to betsofbitco.in. We've thought quite heavily about this and at the end of the day, maybe a technological solution is possible but it won't work until there is critical mass (similar to other decentralization systems). And when you're resolving 'real world' events you're still going to need a human to resolve them which complicates things if half the people think one thing and the other half think another, both for their own good reason. Hence why you need to bring them together and hammer out the real outcome, only possible in a centralized way.
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:34:14

An appeal process makes sense (we've had a standard 24hr appeal period since we've launched). 
Not sure about the constant delays, maybe admin(s) on vacation/focusing on other tasks?

@_date: 2016-11-15 04:07:57
Some of the other posters in this thread do not realize that this was a Parimutuel-type bet (not fixed odds), so your 1.425 are not ODDS but rather the WEIGHT of the bet relative to other bets in the proposition. 
This is not a risk-free profit as it may seem. Your payout on Patriots would have been &lt;0.05 if they won. The payout is more because you won and most people in that proposition bet on Patriots.
@_date: 2015-07-09 17:16:41
You can make this bet yourself! They're free and easy to make, try it out :)
@_date: 2015-04-23 08:23:59
@_date: 2015-09-21 02:29:11
That's correct. Those options are all 'exchanges', ie; you bet against others and the pots get larger with more bettors. BetMoose now also offers fixed-odds betting, but you would still need someone else to match your lay/offer at your chosen odds for the bet to happen. Perfect excuse to get your friend(s) into Bitcoin!
@_date: 2016-10-18 05:37:31
1. Buy bitcoin on circle (or acquire elsewhere)
2. Set up your own wallet (blockchain.info, electrum, etc, as others suggested). This wallet contains your addresses which you can use to receive bitcoins. Think of a wallet as your personal bank, and you can open as many accounts as you want within. Each "account" (address) looks like this: 1MooseXJNFugR6r26aGk2AM8v7Crrk3iVE (ours says Moose at the front because we're cool like that).
3. Send coins (make a transfer) from circle to one of your "addresses" you created from within the wallet in  (your "bitcoin address"). You can use this address when you sign-up, or in your settings under "Withdrawal Address".
4. Send coins from your wallet to your BetMoose deposit address shown under your account once you log in (similar for other sites as well). Direct link (requires login: 
Note that you can sign up with us without having a Bitcoin address; but you will need one at some point to withdraw.
As others have mentioned, it is highly recommended to have your own wallet, even though you could deposit straight to BetMoose from Circle (and withdraw back to Circle from BM as well). It's highly unlikely your account will be "flagged" from using us because our deposit addresses are unique to each user and are privatized. That said, you shouldn't get into that habit as other sites (especially dice sites) will have publicly-known addresses.
