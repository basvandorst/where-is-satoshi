Obviously they don’t care about customers crypto kitties are more important than segwit.  Segwit will save customers on fees and transactions are way faster.

Sure buddy, they don't make anything when you withdraw bitcoin. You must work for coinbase. POS company I feel bad for all those that lost money with their convenient server issues and colluding with BCASH.  Cryptokitties seems more important than segwit implementation right?

Abra wallet needs to add segwit, thought about sending about 200$ in bitcoin to exchange but the fee would of been 40$ of course I’m not gonna pay 25% fee so I’ll wait.

Coinbase makes way more money on fees why would they implement segwit.  I tell everyone stay away from that exchange.  Plus aren't they in bed with bcash.

Don't know about gemini, local bitcoins uses segwit addresses so transfers out are pretty quick and cheap.

Of course it is, you think after they tried to steal everyone’s bcash they’re not going to allow their own guys to make their buys and sells first before letting everyone else in.  Laws suits were filed then they had no choice to add it. ��

Have you not seen what they've been doing especially the last couple of days?  Just look around at all the posts and threads regarding coinbase.

It’s a conspiracy with these huge jumps if they stall a day or 2 by spamming the network and the price goes up another 2k they get better exchange �� Na I’m sure it’s FOMO and servers can’t handle the traffic

Check the mempool and unconfirmed transactions, might still take longer than normal but segwit helps.
