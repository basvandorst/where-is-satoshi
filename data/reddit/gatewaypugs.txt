I read it and it seams scary
@_date: 2017-08-12 10:16:30
Man who sells you that much? Coinbase wont even confirm my bank transfer account
@_date: 2017-08-01 14:22:39
It is safe, but if you want your BCC you should just follow a guide.
Btw you should never keep coins in an exchange. The whole point of decentralization and bitcoin is to keep controll of the money yourself.
@_date: 2017-08-07 05:32:44
Bad idea. The cryptomarket is highly dependent on eachother
@_date: 2017-08-14 00:28:57
Yes Very expensive
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:01:46
I know people wouldnt go for BCH but Maybe another altcoin with more promesing technology
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:58:06
If you change adress each time, is it impossible for people to see How much you have recieved or cam they tie them all together.
Lets say I have a public key generator in the breadstore and sell bread without telling IRS. Can they check my whole history from one public adress or can they only check it if I don't change it or if I give them my main public key?
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:07:41
Planning on buying a full bitcoin more when the price hits 2800 again ;). Just have to figure out bank transfers.
@_date: 2017-08-11 00:12:09
I didn't mean much to it, man. Just trying to write down what I think. 
@_date: 2017-08-10 19:37:23
You think it will fall down to 3000 soon or should i drop all my savings in today? I feel like it should correct after the 1k jump
@_date: 2017-08-10 01:33:53
That's a very good point!
@_date: 2017-08-24 12:36:13
I think breadwallet said they would be fast. 
@_date: 2017-08-09 23:19:07
Why does he have to generate a new public adress for everyone?
@_date: 2017-10-16 10:30:44
Because hedge funds is 10% Max. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 00:27:20
I thought that was to recover the wallet? Isnt the private key a hash? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:29:55
By the way, your english is really good. I wish I could write like that. 
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:23:58
No idea, fam. Both /btc and /bitcoin are throwing it around at eachother. Hopefully someone here will answer it
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:13:47
To be exactly honest, man. I was hoping he would post a special family only link, so I didnt have to sign up on that stupid subscription webpage that gives you one free luck.
Just had to try my luck! No need to say sorry. Im not offended :)
Edit: Shitt i just read it again and understood what to you ment. Sorry on my side. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:13:37
I think he is referencing that BCC guy that says that the new changed in bitcoin core isnt what the creator of bitcoin had in his vision. 
But im not sure. Check out that interview on frontpage
@_date: 2017-07-24 21:31:32
I tried to download electrum wallet, and it was extreamly easy. The portable version didnt work on my 4k 13" screen, but the one you can install worked perfectly. Im currently on win10.
Im not really sure how I find my private keys yet but I think it's pretty simple. 
I believe Electrumwallet is a good choise. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:56:57
You will not get your BCC, but you should be fine. 
I'm not sure if you bought with the marketprice now or the one in 7 days, so that might matter a little. Many people think BTC is going down before 31.august because of the uncertainty.
If I were you I would probably contact coinbase to try to cancel the transaction.
@_date: 2017-07-25 19:37:14
Make a wallet and HODL. Buy the dips, hodl the rest. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:06:06
I actually watched it, and it was okey. It felt a bit like they cheated sometimes because they called people within the bitcoin community and asked them to use cash for them, and then trade the item for bitcoins.
But all in all, nice documentary. This was like a couple years ago, so you really get to see how much it has grown and it would be exciting to see someone try it again with all the new aviabillity. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 22:37:49
Can you earn much from theese? I'm thinking you could have some high transactionfees, but that doesnt really pay for 1600$ + rent a spot in a mall + maintaince(getting cash in it and replacing parts?)
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:45:50
I was actually going to buy one myself, but the price+shipping was a bit too high for me. Hoping to get one later. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:09:14
Congratz on your kickstarter. 
Might watch it when I find my creditcard
@_date: 2017-07-24 23:51:44
You should probably ask your bank what to do. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:05:38
How long you think it will fall? I saved 500$
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:55:23
You really think so? 
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:56:09
Will you please direct me to a place I can read more about this? I kind of understand that it might become a "Split" in the change if not all the miners agree to use the same chain/ use the new technology, but wouldnt, for example coinbase, follow the main chain with all their blocks? I find it hard understanding why it is dangerous to hold coin there when they are in controll of that much money.
Sorry if my english is off. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:14:49
I don't think I like that. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:28:16
Ive only looked at Ledger, but Ive heard that Trezor is opensource.
Ledger has tons of review videos on YouTube to help you learn it. Also, they say they store some of their information offline so it can't be hacked.
The opensource problem is a two way street for me, because I don't want everyone to know how their security works. 
@_date: 2017-07-22 00:50:47
Can you please explain theese mining webpages to me? 
If it's profitable to mine bitcoin on their cloud service, why wouldnt they just do it themselves? 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:06:02
Stole your fancy bitcoin graph webpage. Thanks
@_date: 2017-07-27 00:44:37
Man, Im not sure if you intended to say that I'm uninformed, but as an answer to that: It is completly right, but I feel like it is really hard to gain information around this subject. The two subs are just namecalling eachother and saying the opposite of what the others are saying. 
Today I even got a pm from a guy being banned here that helped me understand a bit more.
I'm also  looking forward to get over all the drama. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 23:28:11
I'm holding, but shitt that was scary. Back up at 1800 now. Might sell at 2900
@_date: 2017-07-29 13:29:40
Bitcoin is now worth 10x what it was in the movie. I'm sure alot more people know about it and more people accept it. 
But yes, also drugs I guess. 
@_date: 2017-07-26 12:10:55
Does Anyone know What is so much better with BCC? 
@_date: 2017-07-26 15:41:19
Read about it in r/btc and they have a much more positive opinion towards it there. I think I might just hodl and see what happens. 
They also say that they are fully decentrialized, but Im not sure if I trust that. Everyone here says the opposite
@_date: 2017-07-26 18:20:32
Amazon ect are just resellers. Also, the way I see it, the more hands the ledger tuches, the higher chanse that it has been tampered with. 
Ive read through their webpage and everything seams very safe and secure. I would also think that a company that works with secure bitcoin wallets would have a secure server.
Good luck, man!
