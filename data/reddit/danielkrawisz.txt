Maybe I should clarify that. I don't think it's necessarily true that Bitcoin will succeed. However, I have seen a lot of arguments purporting to show that Bitcoin will fail, and I haven't seen any that I think are founded on a very strong understanding of Bitcoin.

You shouldn't contrast "using" with "holding". Holding is a perfectly good way to use bitcoin. Holders are users. 
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:54:17
Well then it's a pretty nonsensical discussion if the question itself eliminates responses that would actually be optimal.

There are probably hundreds of new terms to come out of the Bitcoin movement just to talk about all the new possibilities that Bitcoin opens up. Have you ever heard of a blockchain before you got interested in Bitcoin? What about a bitlicense? What about a satoshi?

Hoarding is good for bitcoin. It is necessary for Bitcoin's growth.  
@_date: 2014-07-17 13:59:26
If you want bitcoins so much, you should give a discount when you accept payment in them. That will help convince people not to hoard so much around you. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 11:24:06
Day-trading would tend to reduce volatility, since the traders would be trying to buy low and sell high, thus acting sort of like a dampener on the price. 
Furthermore, while it's possible for Bitcoin to be volatile for reasons that have nothing to do with its growth, it is also true that if bitcoin were NOT volatile, it could not grow. Therefore it is silly to complain about volatility. 
Bitcoins' use as an investment is a necessary prerequisite to its adoption as a currency. The more investment demand there is in Bitcoin, the more liquidity it has, which is what makes it useful as a currency.

Well sorry, I guess I don't see why people would have a strong emotional reaction to it without thinking about how the image fits in with the theme of the article. He represents a hoarders because that's something that Jews have been hated for in the past. The people in this group may not hate Jews, but they have a similar irrational aversion to hoarding, and I am using this image to help show them that they need to confront something antisocial in themselves, something that may be quite like the kind of hatred that inspired this image.

I think it is quite factual that most individuals would prefer a currency that becomes more valuable the longer they hold on to it. The controversial claim is whether such a currency would be better for society as a whole. However, we don't need to argue that point because we only need to make arguments about what individual people will choose as they switch over from fiat to Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-01-26 20:31:53
You meant to say "faster than exponential". On a log chart, the price chart of BTC is well above the trend line, which makes it faster than exponential.

What's really best is for people to do whatever they want the most with their bitcoins without listening to what other people tell them. If they want to maximize their future bitcoin wealth, then they should save. If they end up needing to trade them for something immediately, then they should do that. 
@_date: 2014-06-23 17:11:39
I discuss innovation in this article. Basically, innovation in altcoins is good. The part I don't like is treating altcoins like investments. They should not have value, they should ONLY be experiments.  
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:31:21
Bitcoins have value because people want to hold them. That is the only reason. It may be that people were convinced that holding bitcoins was a good idea because of some store that gave them an endorsement by accepting them, but it is the holding that provides the value.

I would say that holding bitcoins and not spending them is one of the best things you can do for Bitcoin's future, so that shouldn't be off the table. 
 
@_date: 2014-01-08 22:56:25
Agreed. Bitcoin can absorb all business exactly how it is. Bitcoin proponents can just sit and wait and all goods will come to them without bowing to anybody's demands. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 23:00:49
When you're arguing that something is likely to happen in the future it's not like you can give a lot of data supporting it since it's explicitly about something that hasn't happened yet. This is really all based on what is theoretically possible with a speculative attack using Bitcoin, and on the incentives that such a possibility makes available. Refuting the point would be to show that that there are different incentives or reasons that things might work out differently. 
@_date: 2014-07-09 20:24:03
I don't think most teenagers would be able to understand speculative attacks and predict something about their future utility. That's fairly advanced stuff I'd say.

@_date: 2014-08-29 01:46:43
The difference is that Bitcoin has the biggest network. That makes the Bitcoin network a lot more useful than its competitors. There is an opportunity when one holds altcoins as a result, and so people will try to hold their altcoins for as little time as possible. This will bring the prices of the altcoins down as much as possible.

You haven't shown a correlation yet though. Coincidence does not mean correlation. In order to show a correlation you would have to show that an observation cannot be easily explained by chance. I don't think that has been shown here.

Sure, all value is subjective and in that case Perlman considered his ethical integrity, which would have been compromised by accepting the money, to be more important than the money. If someone today thought he was wealthy if he had $1,000,000 but poor if he had 1300 bitcoins (even though they trade roughly one for the other), then bitcoins wouldn't be of much use to him. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:12:50
That's a good point. I agree, I think that the next bitcoin hype cycle may disappoint people because of that. There were a couple after the 2011 mania that were very small comparatively, and they didn't even bring Bitcoin up past its previous high of around $27. 
@_date: 2014-07-08 03:31:49

Try not to let this get to you. I've been in bitcoin for years and I've seen this sort of thing many times. It's still hard for me. There is benefit to be derived in markets from exploiting confusion and fear, so you have to play with a poker face and tell yourself that much of what you see is deception and irrationality. It's no different than dealing with internet trolls. And there is no unified field of consciousness and your mind is the physical interaction of many neurons. You can play pretend about having other bodies, but don't fool yourself. Same with bitcoin. Don't let the confusion affect your analysis.

Appcoins are not coupons. The whole problem with them is that they have a free-floating price and are not redeemable for any set amount. This means that they behave like a currency, not a coupon. Because of the network effect for currencies, they should be expected to lose value over time.
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:42:41
First off, an investor IS a user. If you are holding bitcoins and not spending, you are a user. And a more important user than one who spends his bitcoins, in my opinion. 
Second, as I pointed out above, investment inherently makes Bitcoin more useful as a currency because investment means more liquidity. Therefore it doesn't matter why people invest in Bitcoin in the first place. The more, the better. 
@_date: 2014-07-10 05:01:24
That article just says it's still difficult to buy bitcoins in 2014. It does not say that it is more difficult now than in 2013, so it doesn't contradict Pierre's assertion at all. Furthermore, localbitcoins.com now has a much bigger network too, so it's easier to buy from there as well. It really doesn't seem like it should be a controversial thing to say that bitcoins are easier to buy now than a year ago. 
@_date: 2014-08-30 20:28:38
Well I argued in my article that the connection between merchant adoption and downward prices does not make conceptual sense, so I think that it's coincidence, not evidence. You could come up with a better theory as to how merchant adoption could lead to downward prices and I would consider that to be evidence, or show statistically that there is a connection between downward prices and merchant adoption that is very unlikely to have happened by chance. But as it is, I don't see how such a connection would work economically and I don't see that anyone has demonstrated statistically that there IS such a connection, so I say there's no evidence. 
@_date: 2014-07-12 01:21:04
Well, as I pointed out above, you can't really show evidence about things that will happen in the future. You just have to wait and see. If you don't think that bitcoins have a value proposition, then I can see how the article wouldn't seem very relevant to you. You should probably be reading other things to try to understand Bitcoin's value proposition rather than trying to deal with this article. 
@_date: 2014-06-08 15:05:32
You're taking the analogy too far. I was trying to make the point that holding cash is useful even if you never spend it, like an insurance policy. That is the way that the two things are similar. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:06:45
The value of money is being prepared for an uncertain future. It's useful for that purpose as long as you hold it, even if you never end up actually selling it. It's like an insurance policy that you never collect on.

@_date: 2014-04-10 07:56:03
Ok, so I think I understand then. A coin in a side chain is not a bitcoin--it's more like a bank node that can be reedeemed for Bitcoin. It is possible for a side-chain to operate on a fractional-reserve basis, but this will be immediately visible to everyone. If a side-chain is 51% attacked, then this does not produce a double spend, but it can produce side chain coins that are unbacked by Bitcoin. This will produce a "bank run" as everyone on the side chain tries to redeem their side chain bank notes for Bitcoin.

We know where the image came from and it's not a mistake. The whole point of the image is the way that savers have been hated and been called hoarders and people say they're responsible for economic problems and so on. In reality, they should be lauded for being savers and what they are doing is really good for society. There is a parallel here with racism, so I'm using the image to help people to draw this connection. I'm using the image in a way that reverses its original meaning, as a representation of something laudable which should be imitated.

Money is useful just for holding it because it grants you options. When you have a lot of cash, you are prepared for unseen eventualities. For example, your car could break down suddenly. It's a lot less of a hassle if you have the cash right there to fix it than if you didn't. On the other hand, you could go a long time without anything happening that requires funds, so you just keep holding the dough. Does that mean it was useless? Certainly not; it's no more useless than an insurance policy that you never have to cash in.

Also, two currencies should never be expected to be in equilibrium with one another in a free market. If currency A has any slight advantage over currency B that causes people to buy A and sell B, this causes A to be more liquid, and thus better as a currency. Thus, the advantage of A over B has been accentuated. 
@_date: 2014-05-11 22:20:20
Bitcoin's greatest chance of success is by ignoring regulation rather than lobbying against it. The more anarchist Bitcoin is, the more valuable it is to investors. This means that its growth in price should be expected to be more rapid and as a result turns into a bigger, better network that is harder to kill. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 04:20:55
That post does not seem to respond to the points I made in my article. Just because an app is valuable does not mean an appcoin is valuable.

If it has a free floating exchange rate, then it is not backed by anything.

"shouldn't even bother innovating on Satoshi's idea" 
I dealt with innovation in another article on altcoins. The problem is the expectation that an altcoin will have value, not the innovation per se. 
 
"is juvenile at best"
Would a more mature person have ignored his own understanding of economics and told people to buy something that does not appear to add value? 
"there is often no logic behind his statements even though he presents them as the pinnacle of deep thought and vast experience."
I simply provide reasoning which anyone can judge for themselves. That is the only presentation. My experience is irrelevant because I try to provide something that other people can understand without having to trust me on anything. As for deep thought, I don't consider that article to be especially deep, so you may be projecting.

Once again, you're arguing about a claim I didn't make. We're talking about the case in which there are competing currencies, not one in which there is a single currency. Currency A can consistently grow in relation to currency B, and therefore be deflationary and increase the purchasing power of everyone holding it, as long as currency B continues to exist. This is the context in which the arguments about speculative attacks are relevant.

Thanks for writing this. Ethereum is also a scam for the same reason all altcoins are scams. The network effect makes them uncompetative with Bitcoin. Liquidity matters more than technological features, and that can't be designed in. It is a kind of spontaneous order. I remember this same hype with Protoshares and Mastercoin. All these kinds of ideas are doomed from the start.

Just to give an example, say with transaction A I move some coins from Bitcoin to a side chain. And then with transaction B I move them back. Then a 51% attack is performed on the side channel so as to erase transaction B from the side channel block chain. Then I would have the same coins in the bitcoin block chain AND in the side chain.

No, that's also not a problem. The more that people want to buy because of the future value they see, the more liquid Bitcoin becomes and the more trade it can absorb. There are periodic hype cycles as lots of people try to buy at once. I don't know what can be done about that, but they're only temporary.

There is no evidence whatsoever that Satoshi has anything to do with Mochizuki. There is no known connection between Mochizuki and cryptoanarchy and no evidence that he is familiar with cypherpunk writings. They appear to have completely different interests and all similarities between them are superficial. For example, Mochizuki and Satoshi both left their great work to others, but Satoshi did that after more than two years of engaging very closely with the community and did his best to explain everything about Bitcoin. Mochizuki appears to have no interest in socializing or explaining anything he's done and left his work for the world immediately after completing it. 
 Mochizuki is a red herring.

In any economy, there is only a limited amount of investment that the economy is capable of supporting. In an economy with a lot of really great opportunities, investment should be focused on the most profitable investments. An investment that has a low return, but is nevertheless profitable, is still a bad investment because the opportunity costs are so great. 
Inflation causes people to invest too much because it makes too many investments look reasonable, so people invest in too many things. This is the cause of the business cycle. A deflationary economy means that people will tend to focus on the really good investments and not invest too much.

The ones who hold BTC are the true altruists. They are the ones who provide liquidity to the network and take the risk that Bitcoin will fail. Also, I discussed how entrepreneurship is possible among Bitcoin holders here: 
@_date: 2014-07-12 11:02:42
I think you were a little unfair with your last post. My statement that "you can't really show evidence about things that will happen in the future" was made in response to your previous criticism that "Your "speculative attack" theory is based on the fact that you think most people are stupid enough to fall for your sleight of hand." We have arguments about why Bitcoin should be expected to continue to grow, but that can't be proven without waiting to see what happens. Right now they are just arguments.  
Now there's also the matter about you changing the subject with your last post. I think you were making arguments about issues that are not relevant to the article and when I explained the discrepancy, you just switched to talking about something else rather than acknowledging what I told you. You said things like, "The world can not have more purchasing power tomorrow than it does today by simply holding currency (something that is completely devoid production, and production is what actually creates purchasing power)." But that really doesn't apply to the situation we're discussing here. If one currency is growing at the expense of another, then the shrinking currency is inflationary and the growing one is deflationary. People can become wealthier by switching to the growing currency when it is small, and they will continue to become wealthier as it grows. This does not require any greater purchasing power in the economy as a whole because one group (early adopters) is becoming wealthier at the expense of another (late adopters). As long as the currency continues to grow, then there is an incentive to use it for speculative attacks, which in turn promotes further growth. None of this requires a theory as to how bitcoins would behave after this process completed. If you're interested in learning about bitcoins, it's important for me to know that you understand my answer when I explain something, so does that answer make sense to you? 
As to your examples of unsubstantiated claims, 




That's an opinion, so it doesn't require justification. If you're interested in why people might think Bitcoin is the best money, then read some of the other articles on the SNI blog. One example is this one.  




Bitcoin has been growing exponentially since it first began trading. This can be observed in every measure I know of, but for example here's a logorithmic chart of the number of MyWallet users, a service at blockchain.info. Not everyone gets into Bitcoin for the same reasons, but at least some of them are doing it because they decide it's the best money, and I see no reason to suggest that this opinion does not follow the same exponential trend. 




You can observe the waves of new users in the price chart. You can also see it in the chart I linked to already. 
I think these are things that most Bitcoiners would already know about, and would be observed by anyone who had looked at a price chart, so I think those a pretty nit-picky criticisms. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 21:00:05

There are some ways you have to change your language habits when you are talking conceptually about economics, or any other intellectual subject. You may not think of it as "holding" bitcoins when you have them for a month and then spend them, but from an economic standpoint, it's important that you did that, and we need to talk about people doing that sort of thing, and as it happens holding bitcoins is precisely what you were doing, so that's how to describe it.

Well you're changing the terms of the issue. People will individually choose a currency that makes them wealthier; whether this is ultimately beneficial for the whole society is the controversial claim. That's exactly what I said above. However, whether a currency with a fixed supply is beneficial to society as a whole is not an issue that is relevant here. The whole point is the fact that Bitcoin's use as a vehicle for speculative attacks will cause it to grow relative to other currencies. Whether the end result is going to be a good thing or a bad thing is a different debate.

Tsontar told that story to make a point, not because he actually thought you wanted to do that or in any way to say something relevant to your life, personally. The point of the story is an example of why bitcoin is better if it has a higher market cap.

The whole purpose of mining and the Bitcoin concensus network is to avoid the double-spending problem. A global concensus is the only way to ensure that there is no double-spending. Thus, if you can move bitcoins to a side chain and eventually back into the bitcoin block chain, there is a requirement that the side chain and Bitcoin must continually form a concensus with one another. How can this be achieved?

1. Off chain transactions are not a fine solution at all because they take control away from the user and require him to go through third parties just to make transactions. They just make Bitcoin into another banking system and they leave Bitcoin with no real competitive edge over the earlier system. 
2. Don't worry about miners. Worry about yourself! Mining is a business and there is no reason that their business should benefit by an artificial shortage of bandwidth. The real block size should be determined by the real network bandwidth, not some arbitrary number. I don't think there is any good evidence btw that a larger block size actually disincentives transaction fees because we don't know how increasing the block size will affect the popularity of Bitcoin.

If the purpose of holding cash is to be liquid, then a higher price means a greater market cap, which means more liquidity. Thus, the currency is improved by a higher price. If you agree with the premise about the purpose of holding cash, then the conclusion follows. If you have an alternate theory about why people hold cash, then we'd have to discuss it and see if there is any data that might be more consistent with one theory than another. 
Data can only only falsify a theory, not prove it, so it's unfair to say that I haven't proved that a higher price leads to more utility. I showed that data is consistent with that theory.

Many of the statements quoted aren't trollish at all and are perfectly reasonable. Bitcoin's network bandwith is inherently limited, so there is going to be a price to use it. It is not necessarily the case that Bitcoin will be low-cost to use. 
However, I think there is a serious problem with the idea that Bitcoin as a low-cost payment network shouldn't be a goal that we would like to achieve.

My definition of the "network" in this context has always been the network of human beings who own bitcoins, not the network of computers running full nodes. Back when I wrote most of my articles, I didn't see the need to clarify that point, but the debate has changed so that this is necessary now. I don't think the number of computers running full nodes is that important. I guess this should go into my list of things to write articles about. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 11:27:11
I don't think that's necessarily true either. Bitcoin could be a big network and still be relatively cheap to send payments, although it may be the case that most people will not be able to run full nodes. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 07:52:50
I think there are some people who think that the Bitcoin block chain should be exclusive and only the "elite" should afford to post transactions to it. I don't agree with this view, although the economics of the real situation may mean that the price of a Bitcoin transaction does, in fact, go up. 
@_date: 2015-07-08 07:46:58
If the price of X goes up, that does not mean that it was a good investment when its price was low. For example, the price of a lottery ticket can go up a lot, but even if someone I knew were to win the lottery, I would still tell him he was foolish for buying the lottery ticket in the first place. 
I think that the reasons that the prices of altcoins go up and down have to do with many people involved in them not understanding their value proposition very well. Whenever one buys them, therefore, one risks losing out as a result of other people learning to behave better. I think that being a successful altcoin investor would be a lot more dependent on understanding other peoples' future mistakes and figuring out what kinds of buzz words are going to dazzle them next rather than understanding the underlying economics or technology of the system. 
Of course, that is good for you if you can manage to do that sort of thing, but I think that many people do not invest in altcoins with this kind of attitude and are therefore dealing with risks that they are not properly taking into account.

Any good can be cash, including gold. Cash is just the most liquid good. The cash we have now can have its value inflated away because our cash is dollars, but if gold or bitcoins were cash, then we would not have that problem. 
My point here is that gold can be valuable even if it is not cash, due to its special properties, whereas Bitcoin has no special properties if it doesn't have a network effect behind it. Thus, our strategy as Bitcoin investors should be to make Bitcoin become cash. 
@_date: 2015-11-13 07:43:37
* Bitcoin cannot be easily obtained today, but it could be easily obtained in 2009. You could mine thousands of them on your laptop at virtually no cost. Gold was never like that. The only reason that Bitcoin cannot be easily obtained today is that it has achieved a network of people demanding it. 
* Price stability is not a property of gold nor of Bitcoin. Prices are results of human interactions, not a property of the thing being traded. More generally, you say "What you regard as externalities (network hashing rate, network effect), are a defence mechanism that the dominant crypto-currency uses to kill its siblings in the womb." I don't really see what you're getting at here. The hashing rate and network effect clearly are not intrinsic properties of Bitcoin. They are products of the interactions of many people. I don't know if that makes them externalities in the economic sense or what that has to do with what I have been arguing. As to being "a defence mechanism that the dominant crypto-currency uses to kill its siblings in the womb" well yeah, I agree that is what will most likely happen. Bitcoin is still very different from gold as an investment proposition, though I think it is much more like gold than stocks or bonds. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 05:53:21
Although gold is used as a store of value much more than for industrial purposes, it is not cash because people do not use it to be liquid. However, gold can still be used as a store of value despite not being used as cash because it has intrinsic properties which make it useful as a store of value. (it does not have intrinsic value, just to be clear...) When gold was first mined by humans, it would have been observed to be something that could not be easily obtained or forged. This means that rich people could use it to show off how wealthy they are. Since it was durable, it could also be used as a store of value. This was all possible from the moment gold was dug out of the ground before it was used as money. 
On the other hand, the fact that Bitcoin has a network effect and a high hashing rate is not an intrinsic property of Bitcoin. Any other cryptocurrency might have attained that status under different circumstances. Both of these properties are a result of Bitcoin's network effect, not its intrinsic properties. You could not use Bitcoin as a store of value or to show off your wealth the moment Bitcoin got started. Thus, it had no value initially. 
This is why Bitcoin is not like gold. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:24:32
As to the first statement, the word Bitcoin is ambiguous. I was referring to Bitcoin the network, not units of Bitcoin the currency. I will have to be more careful about what I say in the future!

Sorry again, but when I read your comment above I actually thought you were trying to get into an argument with me that I wasn't too interested in, but now you seem like you're trying to be nice so I probably just misread you. My point about Bitcoin being easily copied into new altcoins is an issue about the nature of Bitcoin's value, and why it's so tied up in the network effect. There's virtually no limit to the number of possible protocols, but there is a limit to peoples' time and investment resources and hence to the number of networks that will actually be able to blossom into something big. Therefore you shouldn't see Bitcoin's technological features as being it source of value. Anything that can be easily reproduced cannot be valuable. It's Bitcoin's network that makes it valuable. Granted that it could not have a network at all without its technological features, but if it had those technological features and no network then it would still be valueless. 
@_date: 2015-11-12 03:45:03
These are not properties inherent to Bitcoin itself. In a different history, Litecoin might have beat Bitcoin for the most hashing power and business (somehow). In that case, Litecoin would be the unique one, not Bitcoin. 
On the other hand, the properties that make gold valuable are not historical (except to the extent that Earth has avoided being struck by gold-rich asteroids in its past, thus changing the relative supply vs other elements today). The relevant properties of gold are chemical, and the fact that it is physically a lot rarer in the earth's crust than most other metals. Thus, Bitcoin is special for historical reasons. The dollar is special for historical reasons too.

Let me tell you a story. Suppose I invented a new hammer that had the potential to hammer in nails much better than any hammer that had ever existed before. However, this hammer had the magical property that it worked better the more carpenters started to use it. When only one carpenter is using the hammer, it doesn't work very well. When many carpenters are using it, then it works much better. Furthermore, as the hammers get better, it is always the oldest ones that do the best. After I invented the hammer, lots of people started arguing about whether the hammer was for good people or for bad people. While this argument was going on, some carpenters started using my new hammer in the hopes that eventually there would be enough of them to put them at an advantage. They ignored the argument about whether the hammer was for good people or bad people. More carpenters began to join them, believing that insofar as there was some chance of success, they ought to get in early in order to get what would be the best hammers. Eventually there were enough carpenters using the new hammer that they started to do better than the other carpenters. They could afford to lower their prices until everyone had to use the new hammer. At no point was the argument about whether good people or bad people use the hammer relevant to anything. 
Branding is important to distinguish Bitcoin from its potential competitors. That is, from the currencies that already exist and the infinite number of altcoins that might be started. It's not important to give people good feelings about Bitcoin.

Thanks! I had to get a real job this year. I do have some ideas though.

Sorry if that wasn't clear, but what I meant is that you can always create new copies of Bitcoin. Like Litecoin, etc.

One thing I didn't anticipate was that the defectors would be so dumb that they would try to convert their bitcoins into dollars--hopefully they'll learn next time. :)

Hmmmm what you said sounds right but I don't remember if I wrote an article on that. :)

Gold is special because of its physical properties. There can only ever be a few precious metals. Bitcoin is not special among similar goods. An infinite number of altcoins can be created. This is why Bitcoin is not like gold. Bitcoin must establish itself as a brand in order to be special, as with currencies like the USD and other paper currencies. Gold does not need to do this. I tried to explain this in my talk... so sorry again if that wasn't clear! :)

Well we also have a dragon and Scrooge McDuck. These are all things we're holding up as examples. So the image of the jew isn't making fun of anything, it's another example of something that is good and should be emulated.

Bitcoinist.net refused to publish this comic strip and fired me for writing it! Haha no just kidding. We still have a cordial relationship but I didn't have enough time to write regularly for them any more.

Nobody assumes that Bitcoin is going to take over the world. People argue that it might on the basis of their understanding of the economics of currencies.

Thanks, I'll see if I can clarify that paragraph.

No, I can read the code myself.

It's possible that some altcoin could beat bitcoin by being fantastically superior, but I sure haven't seen one that understands the issues.

Why don't you just use Open Transactions? It's a lot cheaper to use and it does the same thing.

Income would be something that is different from the security itself, like if you hold stocks your stocks can go up or down but they will still earn dividends, which is paid out in dollars.

Ok I believe you. I'll update my article to retract my statement. 
@_date: 2013-06-24 21:58:49
I would not say that the electricity is wasted. You should expect some kind of handicapping whenever a group of self-interested entities want to cooperate. This is not waste because it serves a purpose. There might be some other way to produce a consensus without spending electricity, but something else would get spent instead. 
One should also not say that PPCoin is more efficient than Bitcoin, because as I show in the article, their different consensus mechanisms produce different incentives, and thus are useful for different purposes. 
@_date: 2016-07-14 02:07:59
Yeah I'm really surprised how many tech people in bitcoin don't seem to think that economics is important or have a very clear theory of money. 
@_date: 2013-08-22 19:27:11
That doesn't make any sense. Why would you want to speculate on something whose only possible value is if other people also decide to speculate?

I've read the Mastercoin whitepaper. The biggest problem with it is this concept of "escrow-backed user currencies", which are digital tokens managed by an "escrow fund" so as to maintain a value similar to some other commodity.
There is no way this can possibly work because it all depends on MasterCoins having an independent value. This enables the escrow fund to swap Mastercoins for user currencies so as to change the value of the user currency. However, there is no reason to expect MasterCoins ever to have any kind of stable value at all, since there is no logical reason to ever use them as a currency. 
I would say that every alternative cryptocurrency is a scam. MasterCoin is simply more elaborate than most.

Demand changes the price of the good, then the price of the good changes the price of the costs. The costs change to bring the profitability in line with the rest of the economy, not the other way around.

Is this video supposed to be for children? It's so patronizing.
@_date: 2013-12-21 01:58:05
That was an interesting read, but it doesn't address the real problem with Mastercoin, which is the fact that it can't actively do anything to enforce the features it supposedly supports. For example, there is no reason a data stream or an escrow-backed user fund should be have as advertised. 
@_date: 2013-11-13 21:26:00
It's not ok to demand everyone to identify themselves! 
@_date: 2013-08-22 20:49:04
If it's used for something else, it's not an altcoin. You can use a block chain for something other than a medium of exchange, and in that case it would actually add value. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 14:51:02
You're totally thinking about this the wrong way. What you should expect in equilibrium is that the profitability of mining bitcoins is similar to the profitability of the overall economy. 
The value of bitcoins is entirely determined by demand. You know, how much do people want to buy them? This is the cause of the price, and miners react to that price. They don't do anything to directly affect that price themselves. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:41:01
What language is that?
@_date: 2013-06-24 22:50:01
Yes, 10 minutes is supposed to be the average time. Since miners search randomly for good nonces, just by luck it can take much longer than 10 minutes or much shorter. 
The challenge is simply to find a nonce such that, when appended to a new block and the whole thing is hashed, produces a hash with a certain number of leading zeros. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 19:20:31
That's hilariously bizarre. I saw a little bit of his antics back then, and at the time I thought, "Well obviously nothing will come of this." 
I need to change my habits of thought so assume any terrible bad idea will grow out of proportion instead of dying peacefully.

Proof-of-work is not a voting scheme, it's a consensus mechanism. Voting on its own is not a consensus mechanism because there is no reason that the minority in any election should necessarily go along with the majority. It is only a consensus mechanism if the minority does not have an incentive to split off and form a new group with every election. 
You really shouldn't think of proof-of-work as being like a democracy at all--it's simply a means of making it very unlikely to produce a fork. It's not about what's fair, it's about what works to maintain the integrity of the system. You can mess around with the system, but I doubt there is a solution that is substantially better from that standpoint. 
In the article I discuss ppcoin and conclude that proof-of-work is probably better for big mature networks and proof-of-stake for small networks.

Namecoin is its own animal and it deserves a separate treatment. 
@_date: 2013-08-23 17:20:29
That doesn't make any sense. If people start using a certain amount of energy to mine bitcoins, what of it? That won't affect demand. 
Plus, power usage is just one variable here. The real limit on miners is the total cost of mining. There is a cost of the machines themselves and of power. Maybe one day we'll have machines that use almost no power, and then the main cost will be producing the machines. Or maybe the other way around. There really is no logical connection between power use and the price of bitcoins.
