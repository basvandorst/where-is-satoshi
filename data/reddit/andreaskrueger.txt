Plus some middleman is covering for the 6 confirmations risk.
They should look into lightning network instead, no?

Better be quick then :-)
From my dream I also remember my surprise how fast it had gone up to that price.
@_date: 2018-06-14 16:28:49
Yes, and this way I can measure how many days my dreams can look into the future ;-)

It has dropped ~40% many times. And it has dropped 87% after the 2013 willibot / Chinese bubble - but that drop took 14 months.
@_date: 2017-11-03 13:51:24
nice, thanks. much needed.

keep some debt, for tax reasons?

Central bank interest rate is 0.25%, no? Yearly.
That (0.25%) has been bitcoin's average speed PER DAY for the past 2 years!
Earlier this year it switched into an even faster channel, since then 0.6% price increase PER DAY. Recently even faster.
Hmmm - perhaps it has NOT been unreasonable to take out a loan JUST FOR ONE WEEK, and pay the loan back after having made 1.006^7 = 4.28 percent plus ? Just saying ...

Willy Bot, clever. So Satoshi's block halving scheme every 4 years seemed too slow an exponential growth, and early investors wanted wealth quicker. To increase demand dramatically at the largest exchange - I get that strategy.
Nobody thought about the consequences? It took &gt; 2 whole sad bear years to recover from those greedy, artificially enhanced 2013 pumps.
Who had the idea for Willy Bot? And how could it then run that long? Eventually it caused the bankruptcy - right?

same here. down.
@_date: 2016-10-29 23:02:46
Wow, still down. This is long. Any news anywhere?
@_date: 2019-05-11 05:46:47
Congrats.
