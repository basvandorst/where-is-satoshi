Rebounding? Really? We are still under 11k. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 14:19:57
Dollar cost average. Buy what you can when you can, many really smart people think this is only the very beginning of mainstream adoption. When bitcoin is potentially 100k you won’t care if you bought at $11,700 or $12,100.  I freaked out when I was new and bought at 1500 and then it dropped to 1300 - now I could care less I’m just glad I got in at the level I did. 
Disclaimer: many smart people also think bitcoin is a sham/bubble/scam/etc so do your own due diligent research.

Dips are on the way sir. It’s incredibly unintelligent to believe there will be no dips of small and large scale in the future. The long term trend is looking great though! Hold through the hard times!
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:55:33
When I got in early this year I looked at the chart and realized, holy shit its volatile. Theres gonna be big dips and big climbs. So I bought in. Saw my first massive gains then promptly following saw my first massive dip where I actually had less than I started with dollar wise. No big deal. I bought a trezor during that time and kept buying bitcoin along with some alts. There is no straight line to moon. Its gonna go up, its gonna go down, but if you just stick your shit in a wallet you own and understand that you don't lose money until you sell, you'll be fine. You'd think anyone investing in something would study its past charts pretty seriously before jumping in. Which is why the dips didn't freak me out. I expected them.

Well, earlier you were saying 4T is over valued and it’s going to be tough to get more money in. Now you are saying 99% of people aren’t in it yet. I just was saying as the world, not just your country begin to learn and invest in this we are going to see exponential growth. Remember the internet? Btc seems like the internet in 1993. People starting to get it, some calling it a joke, others saying it will change the world. They complained it was so slow and would never have application. If you look at the growth of the internet it’s exponential. Btc could very well be headed for the same type of growth.

True - but as a poor student myself, none of us broke ass students should be investing $100 we can't lose. Whenever I buy, I mentally assume I just bought something and that money is gone. I see a lot of people in here saying "omg my transaction is stuck and I need that for rent!!1111" -- wtf dude. Don't put rent money in the blockchain. Will I eat very cheaply for a week to drop $100 in? Sure. Will I put my car payment in thats due in two weeks, hoping it doubles before I need to pay? Fuck no. Common sense people, your financial state doesn't matter.

Coinbase is only insured for any USD you hold there. No insurance company will Touch insuring bitcoin due to volatility. It’s in their TOS. 
Edit: also he asked for an ELI5 so insurance is more in an ELI15

Good luck getting that payout. “Coin base hacked and 25 billion in crypto stolen” - until then enjoy keeping your money in someone else’s wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 13:02:11
All chill here sir. Just saying people who can't afford to lose their $100 shouldn't be buying crypto. Just like people who can't afford to lose $100 shouldn't spend $100 at the slot machines. It becomes a gambling problem at that point if someone is actually risking that money.
@_date: 2017-12-11 12:50:39
I didn't understand it for a while either. My friend got in a little after me around $2700. It promptly dropped to $2400 or around there the next day. He panic sold after I told him not to, saying he "just wasnt comfortable with that kind of volatility." -- fair enough, stick to your shitty savings account. Fast forward through the barren early months of summer and we are breaking 4k. Friend again buys in. Then panic sells and tells me I'm a fool for holding. Whatever dude. Friend again buys in at 10k and "day trades" his 5k down to 3k, even though btc as a whole is rising up to 15k. Tells me bitcoin is a scam and he's going to keep "day trading" to make back his 2k then get out. 
There were a few other times he got in and out losing money but I don't remember where the price was at. He has literally lost money while had he just held during the same time period he would have made money. It made no sense to me. Then it clicked. He's addicted to gambling. He can't sit by and watch people like us make money - he has to be in on it. I also realized he drives two hours away almost every week to gamble. Unfortunately because its an addiction he can't just buy and hold. He HAS to pleasure his brain by doing something, aka day trading. This is why I think many people have such weak hands. Not the noobs who buy in once and get out at a loss - but the majority of weak hands in here fold then rebuy in when they see "oh shit btc is up 4k!" 
This really is the only explanation that makes sense to me as to why someone would *repeatedly* buy high and sell low. Ya'll need Jesus. Just kidding, you need to get help for your gambling addiction. This market will wreck you.

Who gives a shit if the old people think you’re stupid for investing. So many type writer companies who were on top of the world failed when they refused to switch to the “gimmick” of manufacturing PCs. You’ll be laughing 5 years from now more than likely. 
One of the most important rules I ever learned in life is to not do what other people are doing. The crowd is generally wrong long term. Learn to not care if people disagree with you - self worth comes from within not from old crusty people who don’t understand change is inevitable. Just because one thing made them rich 30 years ago doesn’t mean it will continue to be a worthwhile asset 30 years from today.

Why are you keeping rent money in bitcoin? Never put anything into the block chain you can’t afford to lose. Rent is probably not something you want to lose!
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:44:14
Ok well golds market cap is almost 8trillion. Regular businesses don’t accept gold. It’s purely for value storing. I don’t think 4 trillion for btc is over valued - if you believe in the tech anyway. Imagine once/if it’s a store of value like gold AND sees mass adoption in regular businesses. 
Can’t ignore the gold market cap though. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 12:40:05
No where near that happening in the next year though. Sure it can’t keep going at this rate a decade from now, but we barely have a bigger market cap than certain companies at this point. I’m not gonna argue with the Econ “experts” in here though you guys just argue to argue I’ve learned. Good luck with your investments!
@_date: 2017-12-06 13:26:54
Nope. I’m not expecting 1mil btc next year. Just a continuation of growth. Perhaps slightly faster than this year. That’s how this stuff works, exponentially. You should go do some research into other groundbreaking tech from the past and look at adoption rates.

Gold has been used for thousands of years, not hundreds. My whole point was if btc only becomes a store of value and never gets used daily at business a 4T market AP is nothing since golds is 8T or so. You need to try and see the big picture. People from countries all over the world are flocking to btc as their shitty national currencies crash or get hyper inflated. They also know that unlike gold they can send this anywhere in the world. 
4T market cap is nothing when you consider gold has an 8T market cap alone. Go Research market caps of other things you’ll be blown away at how small btc is in reality and how early we are in this game.

Scrubs will never learn. My friend got in around 2500 and decided to attempt to day trade. Lost all his money and said fuck it. Saw me make mad profits by hodling and got back in at 6800. Dip to under 6k and he panic sold then started “day trading” because he said holding was dumb. He has now essentially lost half of his 4k investment again attempting to trade. Now that price is rising he’s all about the HODL life. Next dip I’m sure he will panic sell again. Like you’ve (he’s) been in since it was 2500 how do you not understand this? 
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:43:58

Play stupid games win stupid prizes... day trading crypto without bots or whale status is asking for this. It sucks you learned with a 20% loss of profits but you may want to consider not day trading in the future. TA is great and dandy but cannot predict whale pump and dumps. Also, this happens every time a major dip occurs on GDAX and coinbase - so I wouldn’t expect anything less of them at this point. I hope you can recoup your losses!

I think this is more tied to the futures selling that was announced by Wall Street that’s driving this growth - which is expected with such big news. As more and more industries and sectors adopt bitcoin as wall street is doing we will continue to see this massive growth. It’s natural and it’s expected this early in the game. Sure we will see dips big and small but overall the trend is massive growth. Just HODL and have patience - a year ago I was worried about buying at 600 and it dropping to 500 lol.

Set up auto buy every two weeks or just buy manually and don’t pay attention to price. As time passes you won’t care if you bought at 7000 or 7800. I worried about buying at 2100 when I missed buying at 2000 and today I could care less. Just add to your stack when you can!

Dude people told me I was an idiot when I bought at the ATH of like 2900 and then it “crashed” (lol) back down to 1800 in June. I just bought more at the dip. I don’t regret a single “ATH” purchase as those have made me loads of profits. Good luck!

No storage is safe if another company owns the private keys. With your bitcoin in block chain, technically you don’t own your bitcoin. It’s kind of like keeping money in a bank. If a bank run happens you’re probably not getting your money. If blockchain gets hacked you’re probably not getting your coin back. If you are going to keep investing I’d strongly recommend a hardware wallet but if you’re going to hold off buying for a while I’d look at a software based wallet for your phone or laptop (thought I’d recommend a phone wallet as it’s less prone to malware attacks).

Been in this game for a long time. I started off fearful and after the first major dip I experienced I was really sad - nearly 40% of my investment gone. But I didn’t sell because I believe this is the future. Now I laugh about it because my original investment is up like 4,000%. I’m glad I held. My advice is to buy when you can regardless of price. I’ve bought in the dips when I can but I’ve bought at the very top of peaks as well. I don’t have time to watch charts all day so I buy and forget - and those peaks I bought at are long gone now. You’ll experience temporary losses but if you don’t sell and have patience before you know it you’ll be so far above your buying price you won’t worry about dips and corrections.
