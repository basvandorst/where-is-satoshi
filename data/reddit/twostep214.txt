Are you able to install a wallet program like Multibit? Best to be the only one with control over your coins

Yup. They got my opinion. But when the problem is the CEO, nothing will change.

They won't even let you try to explain yourself before they terminate your account. Too cheap to tumble are you? Read circles terms of service...it's all right there.

I bought Moldovan cigarettes from there. They were quite delicious

But youre too stupid to know the difference between bitcoin and an alt. Lolol. I hope coblee leaves coinbase and fucks you over while at it.

Good luck with your altcoin, but it appears "classic" has already failed.
