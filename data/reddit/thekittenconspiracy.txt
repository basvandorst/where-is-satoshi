It's not a store of value either. It's not stable nor particularly easy to liquidate.

Did you just condemn people for being bad due to their greed by advocating for their murder? This has to be satire.

Why would you use ETH? It's not designed to be a fiat replacement. I feel people have forgotten what each crypto coin is actually for.

It's not even a store of value. Store of values are marked by stability hence why you can store your value in them and reliably retrieve that amount at a later date. Bitcoin isn't even particularly easy to liquidate either compared to alternatives.

So you think it is okay to murder people? What if I told you both greed AND murder are bad? If you're going to look at the world like that we might as all be murdered for shitting and pissing in clean water every day while people in some third world countries are dying from dehydration or a lack of clean drinking water. It's ridiculous. Push people to reinvest in poorer communities through charity rather than wishing for their death.

Yeah but will it survive in the meantime? You already have major vendors pulling out due to instability. Let's not also forget transactions fees are a mess and are also hurting usage as an actual currency. Who knows what will happen with it. We will have to wait and see I guess.

I feel you are going to regret buying right before Sunday. Good luck!

Who is actually using it as a currency? Its explosiveness has caused it to lose all purpose of actually being a currency and it has just become an investment. You buy a pizza with your BTC and you can easily "lose" tons of money. People are just buying and holding these days.

A lot of people think its going to replace fiat (and therefore banking) at a mainstream level though.
