I made like 4 insignificant tx's just to cgeck how the network was doing. Triple checked every single one of them. None got any confirmations.
Also, mempool is full.
I think it's the network.
@_date: 2018-11-19 15:16:40
Over two hours ago, still zero confirmations. What is going on with the network?

There's a lot of people who only want to make a quick buck, and bought near 2k, and are making a small profit by selling at 2200. 200 bucks might not be a lot for many people but for others it is enough. Shortsellers are part of any market and we should welcome them, and take them into account when making our decisions (you, me, and every hodler). They will always exist and if you, or I, do not think of them when purchasing or selling part of our investment, then we are doing it very, very wrong.

Ancient Mayans have been predicting the end of all at 2012. We've been warned.

Basing an entire conclusion on just one occurence is a fallacy in itself. We need more data. Btc is too young for this kind of asumption.
@_date: 2017-05-26 21:49:46
You are right. Let's call them "people who want a quick buck and nothing more".

He is also very, very rich.

These posts are really interesting. It's a shame they don't get much attention. If you keep doing them, I'll keep looking for them. Please continue!
@_date: 2017-05-27 00:13:45
Nice to meet you too. You seem like a really nice person.

I am not saying that this cannot apply to bitcoin. I'm just saying that this chart si sometimes true for standard commodities. Bitcoin has a wide collection of unique properties that are only shared with other cryptocurrencies. So this might not apply, and if it does, it will most likely be a coincidence, albeit an itneresting one.
Time will tell.

I think it's a bit irresponsible to make claims such a this one. I mean, obviosuly you cannot know for sure, and I am sure you understand that there is a lot of people who is just waiting for some kind of confirmation to spend their hard earn money. Obviously you are not to blame for the decisions that others make by their own will, but you can never underestimate human stupidity/wishing for the best in spite of common sense, so I think its wise to not make this kind of post. Just my 2 cents.
I always cringe a bit when I see this kind of post, and just KNOW that someone is investing more than he should because this was the push he/she needed. And then the post was wrong, and his economy is shattered.
Better to let facts speak for themselves.

Well, if they truly are powerful group of traders, who made money, you can bet your ass they will be able to buy large quantities back in, because they made money once, and they will want to make it again, so I don't think we can really "shake them off".

Please someone explain this to me, as I am not tech savvy enough to figure it out for myself:
If Bitmain forks itself, and UASF is succesful... then the network will lose a HUGE amount of hashing power?
I know that this void will be quickly filled by those who have the means to afford new machines to mine, but still, that would be big. Why would Bitmain bet ALL OR NOTHING? It isn't rational, economically speaking.
Maybe those 12 hours they are gonna wait to release their pre mined blocks are a countermeasure in case UASF is succesful enough, so they can backtrack and accept the new standard? And if so, would they be able to use their mining hardware to take part on that upgraded chain? I am not sure I understand but can they mine with the hardware they currently possess on the chain that will go live on UASF?

I'd hate to lose chinese money in ANY market tbh.

Then you must have invested a small proportion of your wealth. Otherwise, I wouldn0t understand this "team bitcoin" mentality when you have much to lose.
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:04:06
I know, I thought you shared his opinion though.
@_date: 2017-06-14 22:19:13
I strongly believe that messages such as this that target emotions rather than critical thinking, are detrimental to the whole thing. Markets have been teaching for decades that whenever people get emotionally involved with their ivnestments, things end up very, very, VERY badly for everyone.
I have no duty towards Bitcoin, this is not a cult, and we are not followers of it. Everyone here wants to make money. People looking after their own interest bring general profit for everyone else involved. Then, the challenge is fair distribution.

WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON
GO HOME BITCOIN, U R DRUNK

There are always adventurers, for sure. Greedy people are the vast majorities though.

Please explain, i am honestly interested. What else could people be here for?
@_date: 2017-06-14 23:16:38
I am confident that a big number of people that understands what bitcoin means as a tech... is only interested in the money it could make by speculating with it.
Human nature.
