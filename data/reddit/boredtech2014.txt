The kid at the Walmart ad agency was trying to be conspicuous.  He figured his boss wouldn't notice when he said "I'm gonna just do a simple back to school ad." He didn't but the internet did notice.

Buffet had 90 Billion in cash last year not a total of everything but dang that would be a nice haircut.
@_date: 2018-05-31 23:22:42
Honestly doesn't even look like the same guy.
@_date: 2018-08-04 03:48:05
Er.. the whole point is the kid never invested in anything. He just kept the money in another spaceship. Eventually he bought that telescope for 6000. tsk tsk,

On your first point. Really USD or Fiat in General doesn't lose value. Really. ok ;)
On your second point. It doesn't matter how much one BTC is worth it It's divisible into smaller amounts up 8 decimal places and more can be added. 
On your 3rd point Wall Street? Haven't you heard NYSE is going to create a Crypto Exchange. It doesn't matter whats intended for bitcoin acceptance is already there. 
I think you wonder what I mean by that, but basically some hedge fund could already make a 100 million dollar trade on CBOE or a person can send money a few bucks to his family. These two extremes will never change and  will only get better, faster and easier.

Isn't a company an artificial person created by law either way they stand to lose if Fiat loses too much value. I mean He and his artificial person that he has 20 percent stake in are already taking a big chance on having too much Cash.

When BTC goes down your screwed. when BTC goes up some ALTS can go up massively and many times more than BTC.

I just did a test login to figure out what you mean.
"To login to your account in the future, just visit your personal login url:
Please save or bookmark this URL now."
Info on the website says 
"Register with one click! Then use a bookmarked URL to login. You can always add a username and password to your account later on. "
I would check your browser history or maybe you bookmarked the auto login url so you could then access your funds.

ya apparently only for a deposit, but I can't make any payments with Bitcoin unless their support doesn't know what they are talking about.
@_date: 2016-03-16 02:12:19
I actually had tried both of those talked to support and neither said they actually accepted bitcoin for payments.

Shit what about Mike @ TripleByte!
@_date: 2018-06-25 21:20:26
Wow looking at that chart I would say it could go back to 3600, but in reality it doesn't always work that way. BTC is of limited resource and more and more people are using it and want it.
@_date: 2017-08-01 07:32:23
Stick it in your mouth.. use it to pull out gold. better yet stick it in other people's mouths use it to pull out gold.
@_date: 2018-06-29 18:53:21
Honestly before I got into Bitcoin my account used to look like that all the time. Thanks Bitcoin.

Dr Evil says Bitcoin will be worth 1 Billion Dollars.
@_date: 2018-06-17 11:04:14
That's factually inaccurate you can mine with GPU. maybe you won't make a lot of  money like a few cents a month, but can mine.
@_date: 2018-06-30 14:59:34
Ya, but Bitcoin should be up 20x.. 3x is just small fry. Bitcoin is Ded!
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:08:39
You beast.. you just created a great Idea. Stop the Spam
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:26:06
yep, but still it doesn't catch the tongue so just a thought
@_date: 2017-11-20 02:31:10
Here is my 2 Satoshis, but I think the denominator should be after the words BTC or bitcoin. So something like Bitcoinm, Bitcoins, BTCm. oh just think of a new word for bits of bitcoins. 
or we could just pay homage to the creator Satoshi himself.

Duh after they shorted the shit out of it, bought it cheap asf. 
of course they gonna pump it now.
@_date: 2018-07-17 06:10:25
Why Pepe, but No BTC. you need to correct that.
@_date: 2018-07-24 14:29:51
what's the point of holding forever. You got to sell a lil here and there.
@_date: 2018-07-05 01:26:49
Oh shit your rich you lucky dog either that or somebody is trying get your login credentials to clean you out of any crypto currency you have. I doubt it tho because everybody that sends a random verification for 65 BTC is on the up an up.
@_date: 2018-02-09 21:21:25
Bitcoin was slow as molasses just 1 month ago, but with Lightning and possibly folks stopped spamming the network because it caused all of crypto to go down. It's a lot quicker now.
@_date: 2018-04-07 18:00:29
Just HoDl! it will be worth it when ... 
@_date: 2018-04-20 08:36:39
I believe there already sites that do peer to peer bitcoin lending and coins that will do this. Take a look at most of the exchanges that do margin trading. Margin traders borrow money from other users to make those trades. This is also the future of smart contracts.
@_date: 2018-04-20 11:45:42
The fault here is the BTC never gets increased. Only the amount people owe. 
To simplify say it costs one BTC to borrow and buy the house plus future houses. 
Each of them except the first guy owe 1 BTC(plus interest). this cycle repeats. That same BTC keeps getting passed between them with interest.
@_date: 2018-04-20 10:41:14
lol. Unlike banks which can lend the same amount of cash ten times over. It's not the same on peer to peer lending in crypto. The money supply doesn't increase.
@_date: 2015-10-02 04:11:07
Hmm.. along with Bitcoin and Litecoin, Doge has been steady since. July 2014. and these coins on the list as well Bitshares, Blackcoin, Bytecoin, Counterparty, Dash, Maid, Monero, Namecoin, Peercoin
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:16:09
WTF.. that's all I can say
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:03:59
Cheap BTC!!
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:25:19
Close your Eyes. Take a lil trip to 3 years in your future. Feel re-refreshed when you are rolling around in your 20k BTC bags.
