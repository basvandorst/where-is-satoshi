It looks like in 2019 it's easier to buy btc with your credit card, than to make an order on amazon. If you are from US you can check out [buycoinnow.com]( \- they are established in London, but there is no problem with US operations; they have couple payment methods, i've been using their website for like 3-4 years now, very easy and safe

Thank you, sir. It's a splendid explanation.

The best way to anonymously buy btc is by using btc ATM, but even though there are plenty of them in the EU it depends on your location tbh. From what I know some ATMs requires ID verification now, but most of them don't. Currently i'm using Coindeal exchange and imo it's better to find a decent, safe exchange rather than going through dozens of uncertain, unregulated platforms, which are always dangerous. Sad times for anonymity even in crypto...

there are plenty of exchanges available in the US, like Kraken, Gemini, even Binance US, although I personally favor CoinDeal, happy to finally see them in US (even though i'm from UK).

It's Satoshi Nakamoto, a famous dragonslayer

i think it was an exaggeration which means it's not dying, never was dying, btc is doing fine and it's not dead - in opposition to what many media are trying to provoke.

First, but hope not last :3

If you have an ATM which is close to you, it would the easiest way I think (and fastest - you don't need to wait for completing verification process) but not the cheapest, ATMs got usually higher fees than online exchangers. If you don't have an ATM close at hand, try [buycoinnow.com]( It's fast, they accept VISA or Skrill and couple others payment methods - remember that they've got bitcoin release sessions (every 3 hrs)

Or if you don't want to trade and register on an exchange you should try [buycoinnow.com]( \- they've got pretty fast transactions but you have to remember about bitcoin release sessions from them (it happens every 3hrs)
