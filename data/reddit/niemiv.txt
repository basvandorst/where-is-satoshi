Or buttcoin ;)

My very first attempt to tip went a little bit wrong, so I try again.
270 bits for you! I hope it goes right this time!
@_date: 2014-11-07 10:04:52
I'd love to see subreddit "I tipped this Youtuber". It would bring more watchers for good content also.
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:31:37
ChangeTip versus tipping in Facebook, Twitter and internet and micropayments.
People are interested, I think :)
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:47:29
Thanks man, but you should use not  And now you are tipping me, not BitByTip :)
@_date: 2014-11-15 10:12:46
Yep, you are right! I was too tired yesterday when i first read it and didn't get it :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:50:10
Thank you! My first tip :) 
@_date: 2014-11-07 12:05:32
You are right about that! But many bitcoiners from reddit tipping to same theme or entity would rise awareness also. 
Think that some socialmedia expert whit lots of followers gets suddenly tens or hundreds of tips in bitcoin, that would make people think, what is going on.
@_date: 2014-11-12 09:44:16
Thank you!
@_date: 2014-11-18 06:08:31
Thanks man!

My biggest and only was $0,10 candy, but it was sweet tho.
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:33:44
It's tipping. You find it under the chart.
@_date: 2014-11-16 17:10:14
This is Gentlemen!
Thank you for a good site and all the effort to give us that info!
2000 bits private

Thank you Gentlemen!
@_date: 2014-11-14 11:09:00
I think this is one.
@_date: 2014-11-19 11:25:54
Mmm... donuts!
@_date: 2014-11-13 06:38:46
And if you look at countries, Finland is quite high in ranging. There are only 5,4 million people and 11 ATM's

There is also risk, that corn in Professor Bitcorns butt, will eventually hurt him a bit :)
@_date: 2014-11-14 22:10:33
Sorry to hear that. 
My first attempt to tip didn't work. I hope you find some bits elsewhere because my balance in ChangeTip is now zero :) But good luck man!
@_date: 2014-11-11 11:56:49
Totally agree :)
@_date: 2014-11-10 11:41:35
Sound Cloud is nice. I suggested also Deviant Art. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:57:37
That's why I really think that this tipping thing will spread bitcoin to people who use social media. It will form as new like- or thumbs up button. 
@_date: 2014-11-17 13:42:11
Nope, you should answer to post that BitByTip send, and then use amount before ChangeTip :)
@_date: 2014-11-11 09:30:18
Thank you!
But maybe we need those whiney people also to balance things ;)
@_date: 2014-11-16 14:51:55
I don't know for sure, but I think it's because ATM operators haven't give that information to website.
@_date: 2014-11-07 09:54:34
I agree. I have followed this sub for a year now and today I decided to sign in because of the changed tune in here. 
So hello world :)
@_date: 2014-11-19 08:01:27
I have only 600 bits, but I'll join you. 
@_date: 2014-11-11 17:20:46
Good comment, but I doubt that not so many advertiser is willing to pay you for that. And if you post a comment that criticize advertising companies or your content is NSWF or something like that, it might be that the only way you get support is from tippers who thing you deserve it.
So let me give you 2000 bits private
@_date: 2014-11-11 07:24:59
Thank you for those kind words!
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:37:51
I'am one of those newbies, but i didn't came here to get tips. I was following this sub about a year before i finally signed in. It was because of tips, but not to get them, it was the attitude that changed here because of that tipping thing. 
I like it, when people are friendly and answers to each other rather than be rude. And Changetip was the game changer IMO.
I have to admit that I was very pleased to get my first tip, but I have already give it to better home :) And to giving tip to someone who is spreading the word was as pleasant as getting one. Even tho my first attempt to tip went a little wrong, but lesson learned.

I believe in democracy, but people are too stupid to vote.

I'm from Finland, and i think there might be some misunderstand of the whole thing. I'm quite sure that VAT exempt includes only services abroad, not inside the country. 
Have to wait tomorrow to get more news.
@_date: 2014-11-11 06:47:33
Thank you! I'll spread the love!
@_date: 2014-11-18 06:27:59
I didn't make any statements here, I just shared that chart. If you want to look it that way, you can but it's not my statement.
I wanted to see, has tipping tuesday rise peoples interest in ChangeTip or tipping in internet and SoMe in general. What the charts show to me, is that people have had some kind of interest to tipping in those platforms and resent tipping hype in here has done something, because people are now searching it from google. 
Of course I understand, that all of those search terms are minimum compared to most popular search terms and some of them even don't exist. But people are looking for them still, because there is some interest in tipping via Twitter, Facebook or Youtube. 
@_date: 2014-11-10 20:44:34
This is so great idea and people are excited!
It's all i got, but it sure goes to good home :)
One candy for you! @_date: 2014-11-12 10:43:41
That was awesome! I started to follow you on Twitter yesterday and it was nothing but fun :) 
My favorite posts was to UN "What's your take on Bitcoin?  It can bank the unbanked.  Here's $5 to think about it" and to SnoopyDogg "i've never paid for one of your songs but i've heard them all. Here's $10, thank you"
I think that every Bitcoin company should give one of them employee (marketing person) a few hundreds to tip like that. What a great way to advertise bitcoin and the also The company itself.
If i had more in my tipping jar I'd like to do same, but I think it's better to give a little bit more outside this sub. So please have these to spread the word, it's not much, but all I got at the moment :)
