New coins are coming out with a lot of potential, there are always second chances. I think Substratum will do pretty well and now is dirt cheap

I went from 135k down to 78k. But I only started with 10k ��

Same base technology, however, remember you can build DAPPS, and that's when things get really interesting.

You don’t hold BTC, you are in a BTC sub. What concerns you so much?

Please follow Steve Job's vision, and add a bigger ram to the phone, and neglect every other component such as processor, GPU, battery, software, security. Then we can brag about having moar RAM.

I’m steering away as many people as I can from Coinbase. Instead I’m recommending Gemeni, today I converted one soul. Coinbase needs to know market manipulation is not cool. FUCK YOU COINBASE!

Sorry I triggered you :(

I’m concerned Ver, Coinbase and their criminal group are going to give crypto a bad name

To be honest, if you had asked me 2 months ago, I was not even expecting Bitcoin to hit 15k before the end of the year. I was estimating 10k. So 16-19k is well beyond anything I could have asked for, you guys need to understand, no one wins every single day of their lives.

Thanks for educating me. How does one go about recovering such funds?

I have about 95% Bitcoin, and I plan on not selling even 1% of that anytime soon. However, if fees are your concern, Iota has 0 fee.

I saved them the hazle and closed it myself. I can’t wait for crypto mass adoption and not have to use banks anymore
