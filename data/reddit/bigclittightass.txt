Not sure if you are trying to refute my point or not but the video confirms my statement of as new users come into a currency price will fluctuate. Maybe I should additionally add that this is for early adopters. Once we reach a reasonable level of adoption I don’t think bad holding will be what it is today.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:47:40
I mean I think btc for the time being is a royal piece of shit. Don’t get me wrong I’m holding some still and not even trading it because I believe in it long term. But in the case the devs and LN don’t get this shit fixed we have far far better options than bch... seriously check out riablocks if the only thing you care about is transaction costs and tps.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:29:14
... what led you to that conclusion 
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:31:39
What are you waiting for 
@_date: 2017-12-21 23:44:04
A remarkable amount of this issue is because our beloved coinbase has been fucking us and the entire network. I have been using Segwit for 4 months now but it doesn’t really matter all we need is the top few big players to use it but they insist on the difficulty of switching over to it which in my opinion is a huge fucking joke.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:50:20
Ha no worries I find it funny at this point.
@_date: 2017-12-23 20:52:04
Wut 
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:10:27
I thought the ...lol would help people see the sarcasm in my statement 
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:25:29
You think the transaction fee and backlog right now is an ok thing?
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:11:58
You are also waiting a shit long time to see one conf. Come on I am a huge backer but we have a large scaling issue right now. I believe it will get fixed but no noobs in space shouldn’t be sending it since they will be confused as shit why it’s taking days to show up and they had to pay a huge tax fee if it is showing up in minutes.

@_date: 2017-12-23 04:11:04
I likely hold more bitcoin than most just based on a pure percent game..... with that being said you have all got to come to grips that bitcoin is in a dire situation right now and it will become obsolete if it is not fixed. Idk the timeline but I imagine if things don’t get fixed in the next year we are going to see eth or some other coin take the lead spot and watch bitcoin fade into the background.
@_date: 2017-12-23 17:44:17
Im well aware of the options I have :) I just want to have honest conversations about the state of the system and the current situation that we are in. Right now any new people to bitcoin who buy a few hundred then see they shouldn’t store it on the exchange are going to be super turned off when they find out the fee they have to pay a rather significant fee to move it.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:18:21
Not going to divulge how much I have now but you can include the 4 btc I lost in 2012 because of a corrupt usb drive to the list of 4 more people who can’t be in the club. Sorry y’all :(
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:55:27
I mean it’s pretty much just all of reddit it’s 99% bullshit and 1% meaningful conversation. Try a different forum if you are looking for insightful conversation. Reddit is for sweet sweet memes and confirmation bias.
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:48:17
So pretty much everything except bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:33:37
I really hope not. He gets hate but I have never had a reason to not like him. If this is true that would suck for litecoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:25:04
This second you would have 16k but sure keep your cash if you love old Uncle Sam and trust him to make sure it has any purchasing power in 50 years.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:05:14
I think everyone understood it’s not going to be a good currency until it finds some stabilization. No coin currently has solved the problem of volatility as new users come on board. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:02:08
Got to keep things broad so the government can keep fucking us and site any number of vague laws that sanction their bullshit 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:34:51
Lol you going all in on eth then? 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:33:50
Unfortunately we have a lot of sofa economists on this form. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:27:28
It’s up 10k in the last 2 months chill yo 
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:31:59
Unfortunately you have to hype this shit out of it and all the mainstream cares about is the gains. You think anyone would care about bitcoin if it was 10$ still? How about trying to get businesses to adopt it. Unfortunately you need the price circle jerk before you get big players to buy in because they need to know it has a large user base.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:17:09
You can like bitcoin and also realize it needs improvements to be a good currency. Right now litecoin is the only large coin that I would use for transactions since it scales to around 57tps instead of bitcoins 7tps and the fees have stayed in the cents range even during large movement.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:14:16
Nope we have stupid fees any reasonable fee right now is a gamble. I sent a small tx fee that I didn’t care about timeline a while ago and it took 24 hours to show up. If I wanted it faster it would have cost me 30$ usd.
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:18:12
How’s bcash doing 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:08:47
Too bad we just didn’t solve our scaling issue by increasing the block size... lol
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:22:43
Except litecoin has been advancing and not fighting for the last 4 years. I fully expect litecoin to overtake bitcoin in transactions per day in the next few months if not a month. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 05:50:41
Yes because any coin not bitcoin is poop. I’m all for bitcoin but if the community isn’t starting to feel a little threatened by several up and coming coins you will be in for a big surprise in 2018 unless scaling is fixed.
@_date: 2017-12-23 16:47:34
Eth may be a bad example. Possibly I underestimate how valued bitcoin is for this property. To me it’s awesome but not something that I would see as keeping interest and invest continuing at the current rate. I’m willing to be wrong about that thought 
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:24:09
Cars are in a bubble!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:21:01
You don’t. If you want to hold coins on Coinbase do it but you are completely at their mercy as to what fork you get or don’t. By time you get them they will likely be worth nothing anyway. For instance you missed out on bitcoin gold peaking around .08 btc and bcash peaking at .5 btc. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:57:06
It’s much cheaper to open a LN on litecoin 
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:03:17
Enter litecoin
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:31:57
It going to become a currency or it’s going to fail imo. 
@_date: 2017-12-23 03:42:24
Jesus fuck Fox News is a joke. I would laugh but it pisses me off because a lot of people believe this.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:11:10
You also need to consider a lot of electricity use comes from areas like China where if that electricity wasn’t used it’s just going to go to waste.
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:32:38
Yep stay away from bittrex 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:31:13
I’ll leave it up to others to gamble on picking the market high and lows. Also I don’t feel like paying shit out to the government in capital gains so I’m holding and likely never cashing out until I move to a place with sane tax laws.
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:27:10
You aren’t but people who know nothing almost always have the loudest voices. These people got rich on old money and I’m sure bitcoin scares the shit out of them.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:27:32
Because this isn’t the only place people talk about bitcoin. It’s pretty much a place to circle jerk. It’s fine and is what it is but I don’t know why people expect any intelligent discussion to happen on reddit. Try bitcoin talk for a little more intelligent conversation or even making your own subreddit to talk just about scaling 
@_date: 2017-12-10 15:20:20
You are 18 get a fucking job
@_date: 2017-12-23 15:29:36
People here likely have a visceral reaction to the word leader however I agree someone or group needs to step up. I have a few ideas I would like to try out starting in 2018 to see if we can bring the community closer to healthy discourse and movement instead of a 2 party system that we seem to be stuck in. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:11:14
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:57:01
As far as I know they already sold them a long time ago at auction to a private bidder 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:09:35
Yeah I’m a huge fan of poloniex unfortunately I couldn’t dump my BTG at the time on it which was the only reason I tried bittrex 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:04:05
That is the thing they won’t even let me send bitcoin on the exchange and I never converted to USD at any time. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:07:50
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:26:39
Sure maybe this is but everyone has been shouting bubble since it went over 10$ and yet here we are.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:25:39
All of it.
@_date: 2017-11-18 02:07:23
It’s about the only thing that makes a public company do anything. If it starts to be seen as a pattern in the industry I imagine it will be added even if no one is using it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:05:28
Not in panic mode but yes i normally do my verification first I just have never had any issue on any other exchange so I didn’t even think about it.
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:04:29
Glad you didn’t put any coins on the site! 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:02:52
Yep yep thanks for the name calling. I am familiar with AML and KYC and have went through the process on several other exchanges. All of them firstly ensured this info before you could do any trading which is a plus and secondly were all able to verify my info with just my name and address just limiting my amount. Bittrex has all my info a picture of me and my license and still won’t let me withdraw on top of taking over a week to respond.
@_date: 2017-11-29 02:30:18
Lol. Sorry you missed the boat I’m up huge this year and I already cashed out my initial investment. You are a piece of shit the world will move forward without you.
