And you actually believe these consensus algorithms work within the absolute tolerances of space time.  
Nobody is going to write a wallet that exploits special relativity and if they did then all consensus algorithms over global networks are vulnerable.  
You don't understand the fundamentals of anything you speak of.  This is clear to anyone who does.

even zero conf transactions are broadcasted to the network before the miners bake them onto the blockchain.  The double spend attempt will create a second, newer transaction that the miners will (or should) ignore.  Merchants can easily verify that they are the first transaction on the network.  If a second transaction gets verified after that, the network  should ignore it.  
I may not understand the problem you're trying to illustrate here.  Could you elaborate?
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:00:33
The consensus networks is so many layers higher than special relativity physics.   You don't understand physics like you believe you do either.   
I only read the first paragraph of your post again btw.  I'm not sure why you keep replying with essays.  You're a bullshit artist and i'm not looking at your creation
@_date: 2018-08-21 18:58:00
Coming to?  Bro you invoked special relativity to describe your easily codeable wallet that would attack a multi-million dollar network.  We were at false claims a few posts ago
@_date: 2018-08-19 22:53:02
I don't think you understand the systems on the technical level you think you do.  What do fundamental laws of physics have to do with the consensus algorithms?  The cost of having two transactions created and verified with the same cryptographic timestamp and then baked to the chain in the ~10 min randoim intervals, is too great.  The logistics of the attack you're describing are so complicated that it wouldn't ever be witnessed on a small scale.  Luck is a huge factor of it as well and the more you break the attack down to make it actually feasible, you're just leaning on the 51% vulnerability that all PoW networks have.  
The blockchain isn't the only part of the consensus algorithm.  It's the permanent and immutable record.  The miners would just ignore the newer double spend based on those cryptographic timestamps.  
You didn't really elaborate on why the miners wouldn't ignore the double spend attempt.

Clearly I speak English.   You are a dishonest person.  
@_date: 2018-08-20 18:27:30
You invoked special relativity?  These networks are no where near that level.  Your wallet needs to warm space time so it's not a bug.  
I stopped reading there.  You're a bullshit artist.  I suspected it but I gave you the benefit of the doubt until you invoked special relativity as the cornerstone for your argument.

The brand is part of the open source ecosystem.  He's not confused.  Eyes wide open on This same argument happened when Debian Linux showed up and had the branding of Linux as well.

I know that he's a proponent and that he also has said he has strong reasons to believe CW is SN.  This is really stupid imo since the  first function of the Bitcoin blockchain was proving identity.  We aren't supposed to have to trust that someone is who they say they are.  The system is meant to be trustless.  
I know that Ver is a bit of a salesman with a lot of spin techniques.  I still don't see that as a good reason why someone with 58BTC would want to attack the network.    Attack meaning an actual attack on the network.  Not marketing.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:50:21
I agree that some people are "fucked up like that".   It's not really a good reason though.  It basically amounts to "Because I said so"

It really doesn't matter how they feel about it.  They have no authority to change it.  Free and Open Source projects are good like that.   If they decide to find a loophole and close off the bitcoin source entirely so that they can protect it, the project would be forked 8 ways to sunday faster than you could say fork it.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 17:23:59
Woah.  I touched a nerve.  We were just having a conversation.  Nothing dishonest.  I'm posting through mobile so... Keep waiting. Actually, I think we are past the point of salvaging this now.   I won't bother. 
I felt it was a good discussion until the last couple posts of yours.  I fully intended to mine satoshi's posts and I still will, for my own benefit.  Maybe you should to since I'm not going to do it for you. 
You're also making claims that you're not backing up by the way.  Pot meet kettle.   Have a great day.

If you go and look at the same wallet on the other chain, it has never had any of those coins.

Most work seems like a good metric.  It doesn't make sense to conflate it with longest chain though.   Most difficult chain vs longest chain is an entirely different measure.   
You can dump your code on me all you want to faux expertise on the subject.  You didn't realize that I can read code as fluently as english though.  Despite your puffed up "explanation", your original "simplified" example still is entirely misguided.  You act as though creating a longer chain through fake timestamps is something that is easy to do.  It is, only if the proof of work isn't counted for at all.  
@_date: 2018-04-03 06:19:13
Miner's only get the tx fees if they create the block they're in.  That's a lottery.  
I see a lot of demonizing of miners here.  That's very strange.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 21:12:43
My point was that the 58 BTC were acquired after the hardfork.  You can see so in the blockchain explorer if you look.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 19:20:38
I see this claim a lot, that it was the spam txs that pushed up the tx fees.  I'm pretty much in agreement with you on this.  It doesn't seem like it's a viable attack.   People seem to think it was the cause of the high tx fees though. 
 &gt; Yeah, it was the spam transactions pushing up the transaction fees
That's him making a pun about spam of course, but the opinion is one that i see parroted often.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:06:29
I don't understand how you made the leap to longest chain meaning the most blocks, to meaning the most difficult.  
I see your explanation, but it completely disregards that proof of work is a thing.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:42:38
Was lurking during it.  Mostly researching the LN because it's pretty cool technology.  Didn't really care about the drama.  
These days, the drama seems to be back in full swing.  Can the witch hunt just not go on?  I don't understand how them existing is evidence.  
I'm with the people that say this is good for bitcoin.  The network needs to be attacked now more than ever, before it's mainstream technology.  Lets analyze the attack instead of where it's coming from.  How can it be managed effectively without hurting the network?  This should be the goal.  Overly dramatic finger pointing gets nobody anywhere.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:11:38


This is clearly rhetorical so I don't need to answer it.  We both know the answer already.  
My point is that explanation is just pure speculation without any evidence backing it up.   Speculation without evidence is a very slippery slope.  Sometimes that's a good thing.  This time is just a witch hunt.  
The question was ( from )


Even considering hard forks, that 58BTC is still worth a LOT more than any other coins.   Anyone with that amount of BTC, it's not in their best interest to make BTC look bad .  It's shooting their self in the foot.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 02:32:04
Spam attacks that increase the fees to $50 are legitimate transactions.  There are ways to prevent legitimate transactions from spiking the entire network's tx fees.  Make sure that blocks don't fill up.  The network must meet the demand.  This way, the attack fails and we don't have to trust that people are being altruistic.  
I agree.  The system cannot rely on trusting miners.  It must remove any kind of trust from the equation.
@_date: 2018-04-14 23:09:22
Because it's an expensive attack.  No matter how much liquidity he has.  
Ultimately, nothing is stopping him.  This is still pure speculation though. 
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:22:29
You'd have a tough time arguing fraud given that Satoshi gave it the MIT license.  He did this for a reason.  It was so if anyone thought they could do bitcoin better, they could.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:52:49
Yes.  It doesn't matter how they feel about other projects.  That's exactly what Free and Open Source software is.  Every chain with the satoshi genesis block that is using code forked from the bitcoin codebase, IS technically the real bitcoin.  
This trend isn't going to end.  It's like in the 90s when Linux was coming up and Debian first came out, calling itself Debian Linux.  There was outrage but people kept building their own Linux distros because the licence allows it.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 20:45:10
Don't feign the victim.   
Your original "simplified" explanation that completely ignored proof of work being a thing, is still an entirely misguided explanation.  
Hardest chain is an entirely different metric from longest chain.  Conflating the two is illogical.

That's a tax write off ;)  Plus it's a racecar.  Trust me, i know palindromes when i see one.

I don't think we're having the same discussion.  
@_date: 2018-04-14 22:49:23
It's pretty much exactly speculation.  You're arguing that because something could be possible, then it is certainly what happened.  Am I wrong in my interpretation?
@_date: 2018-04-14 20:12:46
I'm curious about your claim that Satoshi never envisioned this kind of attack.  You can search all his writings at  and a lot of it is about preventing tx fees from being gamed.  
Even with people trying to game the system, they're still working the system and making it more secure.  The goal then is to prevent anyone from driving up tx fees.  Something that he knew could happen in the event of full blocks.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 18:37:51
I get the joke.  I am curious though.  Would the tx fees not have skyrocketed if spam txs weren't filling the blocks?   If the BTC network can be attacked in this manner, how does one build it defensively against this kind of attack then?  
@_date: 2018-04-08 18:59:27
It's identity politics.  It's easiest to put someone in a box that you've already got all figured out, instead of trying to figure out each individual person.  It's not limited to just this sub.  It's how highschool and campuses indoctrinate people to behave.  
@_date: 2018-04-15 16:42:26
You've built a straw man.   However the network prevents blocks filling up its a good solution.   I never suggested anything other than the goal. 
If new blocks don't clear the mempool, the network isn't keeping up.  That's why tx fees spike.  This is by design.  
@_date: 2018-04-08 19:00:53
Bitcoin uses the MIT licence.  It's basically wide open in this regard. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 21:13:52
Now who is going ad hominem?  Very nice strawman you're building too.  So for the purpose of pushing discussion forward, i'm going to ignore that the first two paragraphs happened.  Lucky for you.  


You're misunderstanding this.  The longest chain in this context means the longest chain that a single network has produced.  He is still defining the longest chain as meaning the one with most blocks.  


This is the sentence leading into that statement.  As you can see, the context is about the network consensus algorithms.  Nodes will follow the longest chain because in the context of that network's rules, the longest will be the one with the most proof of work.  Not hard forks.  
None of this addresses that in your original "simplified" explanation, you ignore that proof of work is a thing at all.  Network difficulty and number of blocks are different things.  A fraud chain would be obviously fraudulent, because proof of work is hard no matter what the network difficulty is.

Linus only trademarked it so that it couldn't be used to shut down open source projects using Linux.  Had he started trying to do that and telling people that only his distro of Linux is Linux,  it would've been someone else's kernal that Stallman, among others, would've kept building an OS with.  
Branding is a much larger topic than trademark law.  Trademark law is only a single facet of it.  
Satoshi never trademarked bitcoin at all.  Controlling the branding has never been conducive to FOSS.  
@_date: 2018-04-02 17:08:00
Bitcoin is a free and open source project.  The law can only protect it's license.  That gives people permission to do this.

Don't do concern trolling.  Nothing is being taken personal.  Your ad hominem attack about "science settings" fell flat when I called you out on it.  Then I suggested we should move on.  I guess you disagree on that.  
Your questions make sense in the context of network consensus.  They don't make sense for hard forks.   Being that they're rhetorical and answer themselves, I don't see a point in humoring you.  
You're having a conversation with a strawman.  That might be why it's not working out well for you.
