So true.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:32:49
Have no idea. Not sure what is worse, losing out on my investment, or having to hear it from all the people who predicted the bitcoin bubble. I hated their cockiness but holy shit they may have been right.  This is a depressing day.
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:47:59
I invested an amount I can afford to lose, so it's not the end of the world. If this is a full on crash, it's going to be sad hearing from the naysayers plus losing out on a movement. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:59:57
You're dumb if you plan on buying now when the selloff is so fast. Have to wait until (if!?) the price stabilizes.
@_date: 2018-01-03 03:38:13
Thanks bruh
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:56:05
People were saying that about the dips to 14k.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:16:01
I do feel like I missed the boat. 
And with a flood of new cryptos I don't see how one crypto currency will rise like that again. Simply too many options.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:11:55
I wouldn’t. Something stinks in the crypto community. I would wait a bit and see at least how low it will go.
@_date: 2017-12-18 17:35:02
The horror!
Starting a FemaNaziCoin crypto asap.

Bitcoin cash has been a disaster for everyone but a select few insider traders. 
It's created real mistrust with investors, both casual and professional alike.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:46:04
Have you tried repairing your macbook? I would definitely exhaust all avenues there first. Even if not fixable, I'm guessing there are still ways to access data from the hard drive.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:18:20
17k apparently.
@_date: 2017-12-30 14:14:54
It will be interesting once Ripple is added to Coinbase.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:40:59
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:10:41
Lol and it’s down 5 k + from the high a few days ago. Keep sticking your head in the ground.
@_date: 2017-12-23 21:28:55
It is a worrisome phenomenon. You would think they have more autonomy. Are the same whales buying and selling the same cryptos?
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:00:07
I’m terrified. Never thought it would drop this much.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:27:25
Probably. Been a fun ride.
@_date: 2017-12-19 16:40:45
Because life is unfair, cruel, terrible and there is no hope.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:56:00
Bitcorn is old news brah. It’s all about bitcorn cabbage now. See, bitcorn forked ya know?
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:47:17
Dear god make the pain stop.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:57:08
Dropping big time. Scary stuff.
@_date: 2017-12-19 19:13:16
Yeah, basically you feel like you missed the boat so to speak for real gains. I feel ya'.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:12:46
I believe Coinbase is a huge reason this this dip because of the fact you can’t fucking trade.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:28:42
A crypto currency which you can use to buy directly from amazon would be game changing.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:38:03
There are numerous youtube how to videos. Best to start there.
@_date: 2018-03-29 01:02:11
You mean bullshit 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:54:32
I've seen my money go poof from all the hype. It's not worth a damn shit. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:30:36
LOL @ blockchain tech. The most overrated thing about crypto technology is the decentralized database (block chain). It's only the most inefficient database ever created!
The only use of the blockchain is to subvert local government interference. There aren't many products outside of currency where that even matters. And now people are seeing the use of that product is limited. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:10:07
LOL The James Altucher Beanie baby that's going to be worth millions
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:53:36
But, but it's going to be worth like a billion dollars! I saw some bitcoin ads and they told me so!
@_date: 2018-02-05 15:02:26
At least you can plant a tulip to make some pretty flowers. Pretty soon my all my investments into this shit crypto economy will be worthless while all the criminal pump and dumpers laugh at us!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:56:29
They are one in the same.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:48:50
I feel like a fool for buying into all the bogus hype.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:32:50
It is now simply vapor. I wish it was still a bubble!
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:57:43
It's a huge bubble that pump and dumpers who coordinated the value bump in order to rip off everyday people who aren't in their elite circle.
@_date: 2018-02-07 21:40:43
They've been running this exact same test for months. They just decided to throw a tesla in there for fun.
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:23:16
I don't see the correlation. 
The Tesla in space thing was an obvious publicity stunt more than any show of great technology.
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:59:14
LOL Losing over half of my investment mere days after the pump and dumpers got their money sure as hell makes me feel like a prophet all right!
