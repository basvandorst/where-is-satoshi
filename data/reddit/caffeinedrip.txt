Pumpin' for a dumpin'!

How is babby formed?
@_date: 2019-10-30 19:59:18
Is this the new thought-terminating cliche?
@_date: 2019-10-28 21:11:13


Hmmmm.... naw
@_date: 2019-12-07 02:45:22
Nothing like the preaching of the newly converted.
@_date: 2019-12-21 16:40:08
You're welcome.
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:20:39
Can you buy patchouli oil with Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-12-31 01:19:50
Gonna have to make it as easy to use as current methods to make it mainstream.
@_date: 2019-12-15 22:00:51
This is some Ron Paul level of cringe.
@_date: 2019-12-30 21:35:08
Digital cash that no one spends.
@_date: 2019-12-02 01:48:27
Uggh. Just stop.
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:07:42
Try reading the title.
@_date: 2019-12-04 14:19:29
Why is it a good article? Can you summarize in your own words?
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:28:08
I can personally attest to that fact.
@_date: 2019-12-21 15:26:08
In the U.S, the paying company would report it at the end of the year on a 1099. The IRS would then match what was reported with the recipient's filing.
@_date: 2019-09-02 20:46:28
The world what?
@_date: 2019-09-11 02:57:02
But what does Ja Rule think?
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:04:28
Demand will be created because there will be too much of other fiat currencies, like the US dollar. So doesn't that make their future value in dollars irrelevant, then?
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:24:13
I'm aware, I just dont understand why the future value is denominated in a currency that will supposedly be worthless. That's not really a selling point.
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:18:42
I guess I should ask why will it be worth 1 million in the foreseeable future?
@_date: 2019-09-02 14:14:35
How will one's life change with one bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-23 00:31:16
Pumpers gonna pump.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:09:52
So why would I care if it's worth a million or 10 million?
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:14:15
I see, so when flaws are pointed out in your theories you resort to insults.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:12:30
But 10 million dollars worth of goods and services will be next to zero in your scenario.
@_date: 2019-09-02 15:31:08
Would a better comparison be digital gold, then?
