Very different. 
1) People may not be able to afford expensive things by using just one pay check. Hence they MUST save in order to buy it sometime in the future.
2) while there is inflation on fiat currency, there are also interests earned from savings to offset inflation. Which one is more is another question and varies from country to country.

If bitcoin really died and the B2X took over, exchanges would just change the "base crypto" that alts trade against to B2X.
As for the exchanges that allow futures trading/shorting/leveraging - it really depends on how they want to set the rules

Ye, there might be some, but not likely. Market efficiency is strongly supported by algo traders to wipe any arbitrage opportunities like this. If there is a wide spread, it is likely to be illiquid.

No, if btc is crashing, it will cost more btc to buy the same amount of Alt compared to before.
TBH, it depends on how efficient the market is. There may be some lag but I doubt many will be selling alts for btc when they all know it's gonna be worthless soon.

If you do the math, this very comment of mine is a 21 million times rarer than a bitcoin.
Times that by 200, it's 4.2billion times rarer than gold. Come on guys. Figure out what this comment is worth.

I am also curious as to what OP means by decentralised exchange methods

Day trading. No free lunch though.

Except bitcoins are going up way quicker than inflation. It's more like you are paying 20-100% more by just spending it one month early.
