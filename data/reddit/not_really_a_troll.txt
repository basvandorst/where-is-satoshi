On the offchance they *might* send it back? You don't launder money by giving it away.

But memes are funny, no? Mine at 10k was hilarious (by my own admission) but got removed after 30 seconds and 15 upcoins.
Fair enough, we don't want a thousand posts just posting the price but a meme is a different take on it.

Where can I get some of this money that is produced on the internet?
@_date: 2014-06-30 16:54:43
I can rustle up 6 or 7 right now but the rest are held in Government storage. I'll probably require an advance fee to secure their release in a timely fashion.

Because it's a pain in the butt to withdraw fiat from exchanges?

So you only tx'ed that amount to that wallet last night?
There's malware that I know of in the form of a miner that instantly and invisibly changes the receiving address for your tx to that of the malware controller.

Because it uses 5 independently mined algo's that each contribute 20% of the nethashrate and have their own difficulty. This means that to take control of the entire network, an attacker would need to 51% at least 3 of the algo's, at the same time, to gain 60% of the network consensus.
Even then, a full takeover is unlikely and the Dev's state that actually, 81% of the entire nethashrate is required to effect an attack.
Come over to if you need more info.

My PM was from this user too. Needless to say, I didn't respond.
I'm sure I looked at their post history though and it was quite involved in some niche subs and stretched quite far back, like 2 years. User now seems to be deleted as does the PM they sent me.

Myriad supporter checking in. Nobody said Myriad is asic resistant. In fact, MYR welcomes asics for 2 of its 5 algo's, those being SHA-256D &amp; Scrypt.
MYR is however 51% attack resistant.

I haven't, no. And I couldn't find a reference on Google unless you mean Daniel Krawisz?
In any case, I believe that it won't be Bitcoin that usurps fiat, it'll be something *like* Bitcoin. The replacement of fiat with digital currency is a long, long way off, probably outside of our lifetimes. Do you think it'll be Bitcoin, once it's all mined out and there's nothing securing the bloated blockchain anymore? I think not.

Does anyone here know if/when Overstock will accept BTC payments in the UK?
I had a look yesterday but it doesn't seem to be an option at checkout for me. I get redirected to their UK partner and only see CC/Paypal listed.

I didn't get owned by it but after yesterday's story, I decided to experiment with it a bit.
Within an hour I'd generated 2 "random" keys that resolved to active wallets with small amounts of BTC in them. I didn't sweep them.
I also tried some 'common' phrases to generate keys and again, in a short space of time had discovered a wallet or two that held funds.

Are you serious?
The entity known as 'Satoshi' reportedly holds a million BTC's.
That's 1/12th of the current available supply. If ever there was a potential whale, he is it.
Whilst I'm sure he's a very nice chap, we don't know for sure what his intentions are.
Tl;dr: He's very important
@_date: 2014-06-29 16:55:40
I'm not saying any of that. What I am saying is that by the time crypto is a serious contender to fiat, it will be too late for Bitcoin. Bitcoin is/was the seed and I applaud it but something else will do it better before it garners mass adoption. And by mass adoption, I mean outside of the likes of you and I here on Reddit.

That's like saying your Great Great Gran shouldn't have spent a farthing on a ball of yarn 150 years ago, because that would have been worth 200 pounds today.
