It amazes me how easy it is for greed to override basic common sense.
OP, think about how you would go about writing your own scam to steal someone else's Bitcoin. Really think about it.
Luring someone in with a "free gift" that they can only access by sending you money first would probably be your first idea, wouldn't it? Now, what would be a nice amount that wouldn't be missed too much, that nobody would call the cops about? 0.1BTC seems like just the right amount, doesn't it? That will add up nicely if 10 people fall for the same scam.
Also, why in the world would you need to SEND MONEY to receive a free gift? This is Nigerian email from *misspelled rich English name* tell-me-your-bank-account level basic scams and I see people fall for it constantly!
If it's too good to be true, IT IS.

Whenever we're smug about a sudden price increase, it crashes out of nowhere and leaves us all disappointed.
Whenever we're looking at each other going "this is okay right?" nervously chuckling, that's when things get better. The calm before the storm. These two things happen over and over again.
TL;DR Trust that icky feeling, it means good times are coming

I think you were smart. I haven't bought a new piece of clothing, new shoes or a haircut for a good year or so and have instead invested in BTC. It sucks but hopefully it'll pay off.

And if it doesn't, leave it for another year :)
And if that doesn't work, rinse and repeat. No rush!
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:31:50
Oh wow, you look like a more handsome Keanu Reeves. Congratulations! And oh congrats on the win I guess. Bitcoin's bound to really increase in value after the May 2020 halving next year.
I would recommend a hardware wallet to transfer your BTC out of any exchange asap. They're often a target for hackers. Not trying to scare you but it's best to be careful. Good luck :)
@_date: 2019-11-27 20:40:45

@_date: 2019-11-19 22:36:47
Nope. No need to report. And if you ever do stop HODLing and take out your money in fiat, remember it's just the profit that needs taxing. So if you put in $100 and take out $1000, you only pay tax on the $900.
@_date: 2019-11-16 02:35:05
Eh think I'm just gonna stack a few sats now I reckon
@_date: 2019-11-10 18:41:28
Think of it this way: more disincentivized miners means less BTC being mined. Less BTC being mined will mean less BTC supplied to exchanges. Making it slower and more difficult to buy BTC. People will notice.
This slowness will generate fear of missing out resulting in lots of panic buying BTC. Articles will increase this demand further.
Less supply &gt; more demand &gt; value increases
@_date: 2019-11-05 02:44:09
I don't want to tell you what to do, but I've seen exchanges get hacked (or "hacked") way too often. Especially after a price jump. One of these will put you in complete control of your BTC. Offline and unhackable:

Could just be that the vibes from the sub feel "male" despite nobody gendering themselves on posts. I am a woman but nobody knew until now right?

Don't cash out. If BTC crashes below 7500, why not hold and wait for the price to go back up again? It will next year. Maybe even wait til 2021. Try to be strong and don't jump ship as soon as things look shaky, that's how you lose!
Good luck stranger :)

Only you can make the decision to invest or not. The price is moving up and down all the time, but with all of the high price predictions for 2020-2021 the current price seems pretty cheap in my opinion. Compared to the $50k / $100k predictions, $7000 is nothing. I personally hope to invest more as soon as I have more disposable income.
You've got to be strong enough to hold, even when it gets tough... but don't invest more than you're willing to lose. Best of luck to you!
Regarding the tax, you only need to tax the gains you've made. So if you invest $1000 and get $3000 back, you pay tax on $2000 only. I think it counts as capital gains tax.

@_date: 2019-12-09 20:22:52
2016 halving - yearly low doubled.
2017 halving after 1 year - yearly low doubled again.
In theory:
If 2019 lows are $3300 as another user said, then
2020 halving - yearly low $6600?
2021 halving after 1 year - yearly low $13,200?
Please don't bite my head off about history not being fact, BTC being unpredictable not following patterns, etc. I know. Just speculating!
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:24:59

Who gives a shit about Christmas, we're in it to HODL until 2021 at least lel
@_date: 2019-12-09 20:33:30
I think the main reasons the market is stagnant atm is because:
- people more likely to sell their BTC to cover Christmas expenses
- miners have started HODLing BTC in anticipation of the halving next year, as everyone and their dog is expecting a huge price jump
- (tinfoil hat theory) whales manipulating the markets trying to get weak hands to stop HODLing and sell, making the price go down so they can buy the dip.
Normal people don't know about BTC yet. Wait for the halving to get mainstream media reporting, it'll be like December 2017 when everyone wanted an exchange account to buy Bitcoin but couldn't because there was too much demand. Exchanges and tech are much better equipped this time.
It's bound to go up. Don't be fooled into selling and HODL.
@_date: 2019-12-11 02:50:02
It's kind of like when World of Warcraft Classic came out in August. The auction house was a mess. Prices of items were volatile for about a month before they started stabilising.
Regarding BTC, I reckon this is just the beginning. No stabilising for another 10 years.
@_date: 2019-12-28 17:58:02
Buy buy buy.
@_date: 2019-12-23 13:30:20
It's because the price is so volatile. One day it will settle like the dollar, then we won't need to compare it to the dollar.
@_date: 2019-12-05 17:17:29
There's not a lot of movement, I think everyone is HODLing (including miners) in anticipation for the halving when price is expected to rise
