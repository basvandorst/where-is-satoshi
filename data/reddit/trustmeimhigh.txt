This is so amazing
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:50:26
You are absolutely trolling at this point, you did a fine job, really. I'm legitimately so perturbed that you're saying these ridiculous things.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:57:46
Oh thank God you brought it right back to cringey.
@_date: 2017-08-02 13:28:42
You're absolutely ridiculous and immature. And it's not a bank you idiot so clearly you're trolling, lying, are an idiot, or all three.  
@_date: 2017-08-02 07:10:45
??? What the fuck is wrong with you asshole? God forbid we advise you take control of YOUR money. No one said coinbase was going to steal anything today; it's just not smart to keep YOUR money with a faceless website
@_date: 2017-08-01 08:15:50
Look up mt.gox. we're not saying the sky is falling, we're giving you good advice.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:06:33
Well I know who will never get my business. Thanks for letting us know
@_date: 2017-04-30 22:02:11
No it's not. If bitcoin fails, altcoins will be a niche market, and cryptocurrencies will take years to rebuild public trust. Look at the struggles of gaining adoption for bitcoin following the big crashes. "Fool me once..." line of reasoning will keep a lot of people from just simply moving on to another coin should bitcoin fail.

@_date: 2017-09-25 14:56:54
I know exactly what you meant.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:46:50
I never said the utility would be obsolete. Nor am I saying that cryptocurrency will die. I'm talking about adoption and public trust waning in the face of disaster.
@_date: 2017-05-07 15:22:04
I stopped reading half way through. Whether you're comparing me to Nazis or bystanders, you're still equating THE HOLOCAUST with BITCOIN. Fuck outta here you asshole
@_date: 2016-10-29 02:53:29
But you sure care to express that you are well connected and influential. Retard.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:02:22
you're acting like a baby throwing a tantrum. You have options. No one is forcing you to do anything.
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:30:46
Calm down, he's just being honest about the situation. there are other cryptocurrencies to use as points out. It's not like we all got together and said "You know what would be great? If we pushed out all the poor!" We got to this point because that's just what happened. The market cap is huge, block size is small, and this is the consequence. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 18:07:28
No. you're not "just saying attitudes like yours would allow the worst things happening". You're equating digital currency with one of the worst things in human history.
@_date: 2017-05-15 21:03:54
Sounds like you're just selfish and don't care about the less fortunate, so yeah you have a nice day too :)
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:53:12
What? How? See my above reply
@_date: 2017-05-06 14:38:09
your anger is completely irrational. Go to an altcoin until the block size increases. No one will miss you.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:46:47
why does it matter if it's accelerated? It's inevitable. As in, the next 20 years. If it's slowed down by 5 years, that doesn't somehow mitigate the impact of it.
@_date: 2017-05-10 15:50:15


No, it's not. Lower wages mean employees cant afford healthcare, causing lost productivity. Lower wages also mean lower pride taken in doing a good job, which leads to waste. 
Governments totally screwed up making a minimum wage, sure/s
The higher wages an employee makes, the better they're able to raise their children. Better children means less crime and more education. Educated people make scientific, artistic, and financial discoveries. The nation is stronger from it.
Look how well low wages are working out in 2nd world countries... Yeah, they're sure on their way to the top /s
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:53:59
That is genuinely hilarious thank you 
@_date: 2017-05-06 16:41:22
I pay higher fees just like everyone else. It sucks. No one wants this situation, it's just a symptom of the issue of politics
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:20:20
I'm a sociopath because I care about the less fortunate? Huh, go figure.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:52:20
I would have no way of knowing without a poll or something. If I could toss out a number just based on anecdotal stuff...maybe 60%
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:34:13
And I thought I was morose...
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:51:10
You're right. To the moon! 
Man I hope I don't kick myself in the future for scoffing at this lol
@_date: 2017-05-04 08:49:04
it's not centralized, so the only way to really effect is is by consolidating mining power and abusing the network. The US government or China could theoretically create/seize a bunch of asics and screw over the system if it wanted.
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:10:16
Are you trying to scare me or something? I really don't care what other fully autonomous people choose to do. I make my decisions knowing the risks and I sleep well at night. If every single Bitcoin user abandoned Bitcoin tomorrow, I wouldn't have lost any more than I was prepared to lose.
@_date: 2017-05-04 09:08:38
it always settles at a higher point than before the previous 'bubble'.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:25:57
Idiot waiter? That's pretty brutal.
Also, automation is coming no matter what. Even if we eliminated minimum wage, there will come a day in our lifetime where automation will take over and when there's no work or income for the poor it will get nasty. UBI will be necessary.
@_date: 2017-05-01 00:04:48
That's a ridiculously broad statement. Yeah, I'm sure hundreds of Chinese miners are all over this sub daily /s
@_date: 2017-05-01 01:49:19
The point I apparently failed to make is that it's delusional to think every big wallet browses this sub
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:08:17
you should NEVER use an exhange to hold coins. The only time coins should be in your account on an exchange is if you JUST bought or are JUST about to sell.
control your private keys at all costs.
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:52:45
No... Its not like a debit card. Your debit card balance doesn't have the potential to increase in buying power. If you're thinking credit card miles are better, you're thinking way too short term 
Edit: totally spaced on the parent comment. I'm stupid
@_date: 2017-05-30 03:13:20
He/She means that it's due for a correction soon.  Whether that's meaningful in the long run is yet to be seen.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:38:26
Umm the timeline? Don't claim your statement is true because it contains a shred of truth
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:47:11
Do your research.
Purse offers a 5% discount where the company itself buys the item.
The people who get screwed over with these stolen cards are greedy. You can get a 15% discount if you allow another user to buy your stuff as opposed to having purse but it directly.
There's no risk if you choose the 5% discount.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:50:34
You're welcome to disagree, but if you think that even 85% of Bitcoin users would just switch to an altcoin without skipping a beat, I implore you to reanalyze what the landscape of bitcoin looks like. For every hard core enthusiast, there's an intangible number of casual users just riding the wave. If these casual users lose it all from a tragic bitcoin failure, they're not just going to shrug and dump another hundred/thousand/whatever dollars into litecoin or whatever.
@_date: 2017-05-17 09:02:22
lol, definitely not advocating for murder, if that's the implication I gave off. Just a morbid curiosity.
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:30:36
Why are you saying that like it's a bad thing?
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:48:46
why are you assuming my position on the matter then? I've not voiced my support for one or the other.
@_date: 2017-05-12 07:25:32
Your health should never be tied to other people's charity. That's ludicrous. Look at how well charity is taking care of unfortunate people's healthcare right now. You think some magical force will inspire charity when we resort to cutting the minimum wage or something?
It's not working and people are dying because of it. Money doesn't fucking matter in the long run. Letting your fellow human beings die because they dont have the right amount of worthless fiat is awful. 
Edit: removed an extra "how"
@_date: 2016-10-28 21:38:34


Completely unrelated humblebrag, way to deflect.
@_date: 2017-05-07 12:58:09
Now you're equating me with Nazis because I won't be nice to you? Very mature. I'm sure the Jewish community loves the idea of you reducing something so horrible to something so small, mundane, and insignificant as you and I disagreeing. You're a disgusting human for drawing that parallel.
@_date: 2017-05-23 10:20:59
you think each coin will be worth ~$187.5M???
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:26:50
It's the truth man. He wants a crypto with low fees. That is not Bitcoin at the moment. Attitude doesn't matter when we're talking about what should be a simple rational decision and his whining like a baby isn't helping him or the community. I'm not going to sugar coat things to be seen as 'nice'. He has options and should exercise his right to choose a better crypto solution according to his needs.
@_date: 2017-05-05 03:29:24
Oh shit I'm so sorry I got the parent of this comment thread confused. I didn't realise we were talking about the shift card. I'm stupid, sorry!
@_date: 2017-05-02 00:12:16
You give off a libertarian vibe. Nothing negative or positive meant by that. Just an observation.
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:54:46
Don't act like he's nitpicking, your first post was full of bullshit.
@_date: 2017-05-01 20:59:20
And I'm sure that if btc fails and a suitable replacement is found EVENTUALLY it will be as strong or stronger but we're talking years of set back.
@_date: 2017-05-07 03:47:39
Then it sounds like you should hedge your investment. I'm not trying to be a dick, I'm just looking at this rationally and emotionally detached. I love Bitcoin, I do. But I'm aware of what could happen and I'm prepared for it. You should be too.
@_date: 2017-05-07 02:48:26
Why are you congratulating me? This guy has an issue with one cryptocurrency, his options are to stay or use another. I don't care what people choose to do, nor am I 'hoping' for an exodus of Bitcoin users. 
@_date: 2017-05-10 16:28:58
Lol you got hung up on one tiny point instead of addressing the big picture 
And the fact that you completely gloss over people that are less than an ideal risk for insurance companies is disturbing. Your health should not be tied to your monetary value.
@_date: 2017-05-23 11:09:22
So is 187.5m if the dollar tanks.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:17:38
I'm not doing shit to you man. I have less than an eighth of a Bitcoin. You're forcing yourself out. 
@_date: 2017-05-07 01:06:51
If you're so fanatical about one iteration of technology to the point of taking a loss on cheaper use-cases, you're not being very effective. Alt coins are a novelty to me personally, but if low fees are important to a user, they will be forced to use an alt coin. There's a time and a place for everything, even alt coins. Notice that I'm not recommending that they hold alt coins, I'm just saying if you need low fees, use an alt coin.
I would never let my enthusiasm for Bitcoin cloud my fiscal decision making.
@_date: 2017-05-11 00:01:34
Well for starters, you should be human and compassionate enough that no force would be required, does the government use force to make you pay for roads? 
Not to mention the fact that we could adopt a value added tax to all goods to pay for it, we don't need income tax to take care of yours and everyone else's family. If some freak accident happened and you or someone you care about were hit by a truck, you're basically telling me that if you or they don't have $arbitrary-amount, they should be refused treatment. As it stands right now you already bare a tax burden for the unemployed when states pay hospitals for the uninsured/nonpaying at the end of every year.
But sure, fuck the poor and those who haven't had the opportunities or intelligence that you only lucked into being born with. 
@_date: 2017-05-05 02:51:22
Some are waiting for it to displace traditional fiat enough to live entirely on bitcoin. By then, (they hope) that their bitcoin holdings will have tremendous buying power and what was once a 500 dollar buy, then has the buying power equivalent of tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars.
@_date: 2017-05-06 15:51:57
I really wish I had another account name when I comment on serious matters. I mean, I have an alt, but this one has so much time on it :/
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:33:46
Its a store of wealth, not a traditional currency. When the lightning network is broadly adopted, it will be a currency
@_date: 2017-05-08 18:46:26
It's all there in black and white for everyone to see. You're a horrible person. Educate yourself.
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:00:24
And it's up thousands of times what it was worth in 2010. You're just spouting nonsense that isn't relevant here.
@_date: 2017-07-31 19:53:19
You came off like a real piece of shit here
@_date: 2019-05-17 19:39:46
You dont have to tell me, I'm not involved in development of the Blockchain
@_date: 2019-05-17 22:21:31
I have no case, what the fuck are you talking about? This isn't an argument. Look it up, it's not like I'm pulling this out of my ass.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:19:54
You're an idiot for keeping it there in the first place.
