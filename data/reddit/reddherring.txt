Just updated, thanks for the heads-up!
I'm sure everybody on already knows where to go but just the same, here's the [Link](

Has anybody actually attempted to transfer money between Mt.Gox and Dwolla since these new TOS went into effect?
I just want to be sure before closing my account.

To what end?
@_date: 2012-04-12 01:47:17
I was seeing if there was interest first.  If I did it, it would be completely transparent and legit.
@_date: 2012-04-12 01:51:51
Thanks for this.  My idea may not be completely original but I still believe there's room in the market for additional players.  Perhaps we could even setup partnerships with existing major charities.

bitcoin is **exactly what it claims to those who understand how it works**

Perhaps they scrape Facebook, Twitter, Linkdin, etc for your name and location.
They already know that I don't belong to any social networks so they didn't ask.
Yet another reason (in my long list) to avoid social networks like the plague.

Personally I would convert most of my BTC payments the same day as the market can prove quite volatile and perhaps storing a percentage of your bitcoins as part of a diversified investment portfolio.

When I'm not on reddit I'm playing Satoshi Dice.

I discovered Bitcoin about a year ago on Slashdot.  I was intrigued and at least wanted to acquire a few should it take off.  I mined for a couple of weeks in various pools (using an nVidia card) and only pulled down a few coins.  Since then I realized it made more sense to just buy them. I just wish Dwolla could make transfers faster because when I want to capitalize on a dip in the market it's too late.  I now keep a small stash of cash and BTC on MtGox so that I can work with the trends better.

I believe this is the way to go.  The money would be spent helping the needy regardless.

Just tried to transfer money to mtgox from dwolla and [this]( is all I was asked for.  No social networking for me apparently.

That's certainly true to a degree, unfortunately most of the stories that get media coverage related to Bitcoin are negative which doesn't bode well for mainstream adoption.

Just logged in and was not prompted to accept any new terms.

The technology is still sound. Bitcoin will recover. I just fear it will take several years at this point. Lots of people lost lots of money and I don't think confidence is very high at the moment.

I had to go through all that crap last week *again*, but my money did transfer.  I assume that was prior to the new TOS however.
@_date: 2011-09-12 01:38:52
I think this is a fantastic idea, I now have the option of storing bitcoins in a safe as opposed to my virtual wallet.  Options are always good, I will most likely pick-up a few of these.

Once I was on vacation and my credit card was flagged and I was out in the world with absolutely no way to pay for anything.  I escalated my call all the way up the chain and nobody would activate my card even though I could provide my SSN, phone  address, mothers maiden name, etc.  They would only activate it with specific transaction details down to the penny.  This was a while ago and I didn't have internet on my phone so I had to wait until I could get to a computer and log on to my bank account before I could get things straightened out.  Luckily my wife had enough cash on her to take care of us for awhile but it could have turned into a bad situation.  Mass bitcoin adoption can't come soon enough.
