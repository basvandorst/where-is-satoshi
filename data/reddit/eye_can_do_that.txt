In reality you are just not looking at the whole picture, because bitcoin doesn't change anything about what this story is about at all.
1) You don't need to trust anyone with your money now, keep it at home under your bed.  Worried about your house burning down or a break in, you have the same issue with your digital wallet.  You can keep it in your home, but if it burns down you lost it.  You can keep it in multiple places but now you are more likly to have a break in (you have to keep more places secure).  If bitcoin was to become a thing everyone had, then there would be institutions that you trust to hold your digital wallets, just like we use banks.
2) People will still want to borrow money, and people will still want to loan money out for an interest.  Institutions would pop up to help people do this with bit coins, just like we use banks.  If that place, let's call it JPM want's to decieve people buying loans from them they still can.
3) Bitcoin isn't backed by any commodity.  You can argue that the USD isn't either.  That is a seperate argument, but even if you are right then this is a draw, bitcoin can't claim a win.
4) The advantage of devaluation of USD due to increased printed currency is something bitcoin can call a win.  But if the US public really wanted this they could vote for candidates that opposed this which would prevent the US from doing it.  But there are some advantages to printing more money, with the USD and a smart government then the USD would call this a win, but that is not the case right now.

And it is misleading too.  Just stop using it.
