Bitcoin is a decentralized solution to central powers. 
[The Fed saying today before Congress that Bitcoin is a store of value like gold]( should be sending the price through the roof. It legitimizes it for the average folk that still seeks permission from the authorities. Decentralized limited-supply sound money will replace the old centralized printed-to-infinity governments fiat. Get free from central powers, be your own bank. Bitcoin is better than gold since it's scarcer, borderless, programmable, censorship-resistant and permissionless.

They can't manipulate Bitcoin as easy as they do with gold/silver. With Bitcoin you can prove the amount there really is but with gold/silver they issue unlimited gold/silver 'paper contracts' (100oz paper to 1oz metal or even maybe 1000oz:1oz or more, no way to really know). When they want to bring the price down, they simply flood the market with tons of sells of paper contracts (that would be imposible with real gold/silver), causing a selling cascade and margin calls. That's why the price of silver is dirt right now ($15 per oz) and gold is also very undervalued. This is how they keep the metal prices down.

My 'aha' moment was when bitcoin led me to realize what 'decentralization' was... that empowering feeling that I could own stock on something of limited supply, that had a 99.9% of probability to be useful for something in the future and that could never be killed by any central power. The 'upside' potential was just huge vs the risk of losing a few thousand bucks.
With time, the 'clicks'  just kept happening, one of the greatest was to be aware that Bitcoin was, among many great things, a world-wide distributed IMMUTABLE ledger, the possible uses for that are practically infinite and it gives Bitcoin an 'intrinsic' value, that many still argue it doesn't have.

No, the lowest/bottom of the next 'bubble'/cycle is always higher than the highs of the previous cycle, so it will "crash" to over 20,000.
So in the current cycle/bubble' it will go to something like 90,000 or 100,000 and will "crash" to 30,000 or 40,000 and Bitcoin will be declared 'dead' again. And the nocoiners will say: "I told you! it was a bubble...phew! good thing I didn't buy any!"

Edit: Great answer by Blockonomics there:
- One of the reason they are getting less payments is because they are using BitPay that generates [QR code not supported]( by major bitcoin wallets
- Second all BTC merchants [have low volume]( currently in the bear market
- Wanted to understand what maintaining costs they are talking about. They can easily switch to other bitcoin payment gateways and have zero cost.
On behalf of Blockonomics, we can help them integrate within a day and not have any overheads. Here is [an example](

Countries are looking for ways to bypass USA SWIFT's (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) enormous centralized power to transfer money around the world.

Bitcoin is the perfect solution for that and at least some countries will start using it to bypass that centralized control.

Then you haven't been paying attention to the impressive and consistent development and growth of the Bitcoin ecosystem. As stated before, there are many reasons for the price to go up, and very few for it to go down.

That's the point. Convert your forever-devaluating 'faith-in-government'  centralized infinite-supply fake money into real decentralized limited-supply sound money (Bitcoin). And that applies to all fiat (even the "mighty" US dollar), they are all sinking ships, they are just sinking at a different speed, and that gives the illusion that some of them are not sinking.
Edit: Typo.
@_date: 2019-06-12 10:21:49
Has not happened yet, not by a long shot. The "Gold Rush" will happen when at least 1% of the total population will start chasing after the last few million Bitcoins left. That is the time when it will sink in the collective consciousness not only the real Bitcoin value/usefulness but also its limited supply and scarcity.
As long as one Bitcoin is worth only less than 1 million US dollars, it is a cheap Bitcoin and you should keep stacking sats.

Their "blockchain" will be extremely vulnerable. At 10 million per node it will never compete with the real decentralized Bitcoin Blockchain. 
They could've easily embraced Bitcoin and LN to develop a really free, secure and fast payment network, but their greed for profits, power and control will lead them to certain failure. They will get hacked to death if their coin even survives a few months after launch.
How can't they see that the project is unsustainable? Even if some companies are dumb enough to cough up 10M to own a node, the continuing costs of maintaining the network will make them quit their node.
What would be their incentives/rewards if they are not planning to fleece their users with high fees or tricky conversion rates between fiat and their coin?
We understand the possible benefits for Facebook, but why would any other company subsidize continuously that expensive project?

I think this is the most probable outcome. China has no many other options (if any) to get a slice of the Bitcoin cake. The "monopoly" they are talking about it only applies to China, it's not suggesting a worldwide thing, so, given the circumstances, I'd welcome that 'monopoly' there, rather than nothing at all or an outright Bitcoin ban.

If you are on the US, start with safe, insured, fully licenced and regulated exchanges like Gemini or Coinbase. Once you have learned how to use your own wallet and feel comfortable you can keep the coins by yourself. But for newbies, well-established exchanges are a better option, contrary to the suggestions here that you should keep your own keys, when you don't even know what those 'keys' are. 
The suggestion above is an unpopular opinion here, but your coins are much safer on Gemini or Coinbase. Make sure you learn how to use 2FA (two-factor authentication) for ALL your online accounts (even email). Use Google Authenticator or Authy for 2FA, not text/SMS or email 2FA.

A Ponzi or Pyramid is centralized by nature, with one (or a few) individuals at its center (top) in control, till it collapses when no more new money is coming in.
Bitcoin is decentralized, it's not a useless scheme but a useful new technology, and although some individuals that bought early (like in any other technology that succeeds) have a large number of coins, that doesn't make it 'centralized'. The decentralization lies on the tens of thousands of nodes distributed all around the globe, securing the most powerful computational network in the world and giving Blockchain (Global Ledger)/Bitcoin its main attribute: Immutability. It can't be copied, hacked, altered, duplicated, erased, blocked, etc.
It's very difficult to see the value of Blockchain/Bitcoin for newbies, all you can do is to try to explain and point to useful info. You can take a horse to the lake, but not force it to drink water. But don't sweat it, many people will continue to call Bitcoin a Ponzi/Pyramid/Bubble for many years to come, and that's normal and expected for a new technology that is growing so fast and most don't have a clue what it is. Just ignore those people (you won't convince them anyway) and keep stacking sats and Hodling!

@_date: 2018-11-24 11:39:38
Yes, is blatantly obvious and rampant, somebody is paying fud-trolls en-masse, [this]( was front page when I came in here an hour ago, and [fake-news articles]( like that one are flooding this sub, the Mods need to step up their game.
All this activity tells me, this is a great time to keep buying and Hodling. This happened on the previous bottoms of the previous 'crashes' in an attempt to bring the price as low as possible before the whales start swallowing those cheap coins that were panic-sold by weak hands.
Tagging the trolls and bots helps to save time.
Please tag, downvote, and report all those trolls.

Calm down, see it like this: If you want to build a better, stronger house, you need to demolish the old and crumbling one first. Just patching it here and there will only delay its inevitable collapse. So it's better to do a controlled demolition while warning to all people inside to get out. If they refuse to listen to the warnings it's not your fault, you can't force them out against their free will.

This is not true.
Also, Coinbase is one of the safest options for newbies. They store the coins in cold storage, and they have a very secure 'vault' service.
Even very teach savvy people keep losing their coins by storing them themselves.
@_date: 2019-09-08 05:50:21






Disagree, that is not a valid argument for a price decrease since those 3 million bitcoin left to mine (not 4 million) will be mined extremely and ever slowly, over many, many years. If demand keeps its pace, the price will only continue to increase, until it reaches the top of the adoption 'S' curve.

Yes, americanpegasus was almost always right, but her high level of confidence and enthusiasm didn't sit well with the hivemind, she was consistently mocked and downvoted despite being a great contributor to the Bitcoin ecosystem in several areas. She was banned multiple times and had to create new accounts, I wonder what's her current username.
It happened to me also, my accounts were banned sitewide several times for posting about Bitcoin occasionally on other subreddits when there was a related and relevant topic, so I don't do it anymore and so far this new account is lasting more than previous ones. There are many old bitcoiners among us with relatively new usernames due to that consistent banning on very active Bitcoin posters. Reddit has proven it doesn't like Bitcoin, and that's their loss.
Edit: Her name is Katie Charm. I hope she still hangs out around here. We miss you!

No big deal, hopefully they can prevent this in the future, but they stopped further loss and they will cover the losses for their customers in full. Also, the 'hack' just affected their hot wallet, which contains in total around 2% of their bitcoin holdings, and just a part of that wallet was affected; so in the end the percentage of lost bitcoins can come up just around 0.1% or something like that. Buy these FUD/panic dips.

Stop this stupid FUD posts. Bitcoin adoption hasn't stopped, at all. You are ignoring all the growth statistics and metrics available.
Are you still forecasting $1,500 by end of year as you have stated on previous posts? I think you prediction will fail miserably, even as you and an army of fudsters keep trying with posts like these.
@_date: 2019-05-27 16:56:14
Haven't you seen all the previous "bubbles"/cycles? Bitcoin growth is exponential, and we are barely starting. Next "bubble" will go to 60, 80 or 100k, and then, as always, "collapse" around 30k: The bottom of every "collapse" is always higher than the ATH of the previous "bubble". So next cycle will en up above the previous ATH, that is: **above 20k.**
@_date: 2019-05-25 11:03:57

I don't. We will have many secont layer applications (like Segwit working right now) and sidechains. Read up on Lightning Network, it is also working great right now, even though not mature yet, and many more in the pipeline, thousands of the smartest people in the world are working on it. The main chain is for security, expensive, immutable, digital gold.
Just like the internet on the 90's, it was slow, difficult to use and was "only for criminals and pedophiles". Then, second layer apps started to make it faster and more useful... and it hasn't stopped.
@_date: 2019-05-30 23:32:09
Yes, there is only one real Bitcoin. The only one with a worldwide decentralized network, the only one with a true Immutable Ledger. All other coins (maybe except Litecoin) are centralized trash.

Whales loaded and picked up all the cheap coins dropped by shaken weak hands. Now they push the next bull market. Don't fight the whales, follow their movements and you will know what to do.

As I posted, your comments didn't age well, [they were proven wrong](
@_date: 2019-05-30 00:11:30
A lot of people repeat that falsehood ("people will sell bitcoin in hard times") because from one point of view seems logical, but that is far from what really happens. Bitcoin has proven to be the best safe haven by far in hard economic times, and it has always done well when there's any economic stress, actually, [Bitcoin was born in one](
If you personally fall in hard times, you may sell, but in a general crisis, where the fiat is falling in value, you would not sell your Bitcoins if it's not an emergency, on the contrary, you would be buying more, you would be converting your rapidly depreciating fiat to Bitcoin, just as it has been done in every country in that situation since Cyprus, most recently: Iran, Argentina, Venezuela, etc..

Hopefully, this will bring Chinese bitcoiners back, now with the confidence that owning it is completely legal.
Aside from the memes ("China 'unbans' bitcoin again!"), this is good news.

Where's Andreas and Saifedean?
But they have Voorhees and Jihan Wu?
Well... at least Roger and Craig aren't there.

Bullshit, nothing in that fud-article makes sense. That's not how exponential growth works. He is predicting a lower low than previous cycles and that hasn't happened before. Yes, an 80%+ retracement, but to a higher level than the previous cycles, and then primed for the next exponential round. This is just cheap fud.

Wow, great Bitcoin advertisement, Pompliano destroyed that uneducated troll so many times, my favorite one was when the troll repeated the lie about "I can't pay my taxes with bitcoin", but this time Pompliano told him: "...Actually, you can..." and proceded to explain...BOOM!, that uninformed troll got burned!

@_date: 2019-05-21 00:00:07


No, do your research. There is only one Bitcoin (BTC). "Bitcoin" Cash (Bcash/BCH) is a centralized scam created by a known fraudster: Roger Ver, by forking Bitcoin. Then another known fraudster (Craig Wright, the scammer who ridiculously claims he is Satoshi Nakamoto without a shred of proof) forked Bcash and created another false bitcoin (BSV). I'm just waiting for Calvin Alaire, another fraudster of the same kind, to fork Craig's scam bitcoin.

Roger's cam coin bcash shouldn't ve valued 4x over a legit coin like Litecoin. But many newbies are getting scammed and they think bcash is the  "real bitcoin". That's why we need to keep exposing Roger's and Craig's scams.

Yes, the 'fud-flood' has been obvious. That's a sign that we see always at the bottoms, next phase will be back to the 'pump-fomo-moon' one. Now is exactly the best time to buy/hodl not to sell.
