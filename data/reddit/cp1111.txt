As I understand it they're not officially colored.  They're just tracked.  So for example let's say you and I start a company.  I create a transaction of 100 Satoshis and send 50 to my address and 50 to yours.  I write down some sort of contract that says each of the 100 satoshis in transaction c4e13fd8d5d4a6a0b represents 1% of our company.  This is recorded in the blockchain and proves that we each have 50% stake in this company.  Now you want to sell half your stake to Joe.  Joe buys 25 of those Satoshis from you for $50 million (our company is very cool).  Now the blockchain records that I have 50%, you have 25%, and Joe has 25% stake (only because of the 100 original satoshis in this transaction I have 50, you have 25, and Joe has 25).  We don't need an accountant or stock broker or lawyer to do this.

The worst part is the people you sold to will probably mine for 45 days and then charge back on you.

How can you explain this to a 5 year old?  Computers guess a number.  If they get it correct you win nerd money.  If they are wrong they guess again.  The faster the computer the faster you can guess.  Over time the guessing gets harder as more people try guessing.  Like it started guess 1-10, then guess 1-20, then guess 1-100, guess 1-1000, etc.

It's from a botnet. Someone uses a virus to infect a bunch of computers and they all hash away on a block that only contains 1 transaction (the transaction to send 25 BTC to the hackers).  If the hacker wanted to include other people's transactions he would have to constantly send new blocks to solve to the miners, which would take up bandwidth and could lead to detection.  Or each compromised computer would need to run bitcoind, leading to detection.

localbitcoins.com -- you can transfer in person or by depositing cash in a bank account.  Make sure you use their escrow features.

Whatever you do don't use a brain wallet.  Brain wallets are the least secure and get stolen instantly, even if they were generated with an offline computer (by downloading some script).  You need cold storage.

The credit card requirement is for age verification in some countries.  So it will be tough to find ones that are allowed to accept BTC only.

The first week is worth 1/6 of the bitcoins you'll ever make from the device.

9.6 million in sales.  I wonder what percent of blockchain transactions this is (actual vendor transactions).

You would have to try for billions of years to find one.

It's better to install armory on a USB key as an offline install.  Here are instructions:

Only use a brain wallet if it's been computer generated.  Humans are terrible at it.  You're better off just printing out a computer generated private key.
@_date: 2013-07-29 17:31:37
Brainwallets are the worst way to secure your bitcoins.  Hackers are constantly watching weak brainwallet addresses and will instantly scoop your funds.  Almost all brainwallet keys are weak.  Stick with bitcoin-qt, armory, or electrum only.

You could probably submit it yourself, but the coinbase in the block would send the generated coins to the pool anyway.

Turn on whichever computer he used to access his bitcoins and try to find and open: bitcoin-qt, multibit, armory, or electrum.  If you find one and it shows a balance, try to guess his password.  If you get access, post back and ask how to sell them.

Even if you have multiple transactions into the same address they are still identifiable by their transaction ID.
Address:  1blahblahblah
Unspent outputs:
    ab3c3d6280  0.69
    d6a5cd2222  0.69
    abd4ffad280  0.69
    ab3c341280  0.69
You can spend any of those 0.69 or all of them.

Just because the % is lower doesn't mean it's slowing down.  If the absolute increase is higher than previous then it's still speeding up.

You have to reboot anyway for a dual boot setup.  The way armory works is that you run the online armory in your regular windows day to day use.  The USB key has your offline client which doesn't need to sync the blockchain.  The benefit is that you can see your balance in the online version that is always running.  And you have access to the internet to copy and paste addresses.
If you reboot to use electrum it's much more difficult to know your balances at all times and it's a pain to write down / look up addresses to send to or to receive from.

When I filed a dispute I got an email from BFL saying it was refunded.  Then they shipped me the product (months ahead of where I was in the queue).  All the while it showed as still being disputed in my CC account.  When the product arrived I refused the delivery and a little while later my CC resolved the dispute in my favor.  Others have reported BFL shipping to them after disputing the charges.  I can only assume that your CC company will vote in BFL's favor if you accept the package while your dispute is still open.  The refund email from BFL meant nothing in my case.  You're only in the clear when your CC company resolves the dispute.

What operating system?  Is it the latest version of bitcoin-qt?  It should get the timezone data from your OS.
@_date: 2013-09-30 23:39:46
Unfortunately, no.  They're shipping March 1 right now.  So $150 @ $30/BTC means he could have bought 5 BTC.  Then the upgrade ordered later at $100, would have brought 1 BTC.  Let's give him a very conservative 50% increase / month and only $0.1/kWh.  Max earnings are  1.88 BTC.
But can't fault him for ordering it, no one's psychic.
