I too work in I.T. and have since 1997. I have never had a virus, trojan or infected PC one time in nearly 2 decades of daily usage. I have BitcoinCore running on a WindowsXP machine with free version of Avast on it and I'm not worried about losing my coins. My wallet is encrypted and my password is safe. Don't be a pussy!

Thanks for the information. I'm no fanboy of the service and I have seen some weaknesses but they seem to be honestly trying to build a good platform even with the scammers which are pretty much a problem in all aspects of bitcoin and not just lending. I think microloans could be an excellent way to spread bitcoin around the globe and make cryptocurrencies and investment capital available to anyone anywhere.
@_date: 2016-08-31 12:10:28
I disagree. Loanbase is a legit site, however it is one of the few.

Microsofts inept integration has nothing to do with bitcoin. Based on their past experience with adopting open source tech they're most likely looking at bitcoin only for the patents. Their half ass attempt at accepting bitcoin just proves they were never serious about the tech and only used it as a "me too" Pr move. Did anyone consider Microsoft tanked the integration and crapped up the bitcoin user experience on purpose?
@_date: 2016-08-31 15:53:52
I didn't pull my opinion out of my ass. My experience obviously has been different then yours but its good to know that not everyone has been happy. Care to share more of your experience with these scam sites? How were you burned by them personally?

I am not certain that it is bad. My issue is with notification. Food, water and air are vital to life and anything that may compromise any of those needs to be dealt with accordingly. Labeling GMO foods gives the consumer a choice. Is that so difficult a request?

No, if food companies want to feed us GMO they need to prove it will not harm us. If GMO is harmless there should be no fear of labeling GMO foods.

Source? How do you know that most people fear God? What if most people think God is a fricking joke, a figment of a delusional imagination? Does that mean his wrath does not exist? God and his wrath exists in the minds of simpletons who require him to validate their existence. Now, back to GMO labeling. Can you imagine a valid reason not to label GMO foods?

I think it has gained more global acceptance in the 2 years I have been following it. What I think you and I to a certain extent have seen is that Bitcoin is growing much slower than we expect it to. We both recognize that Bitcoin is going to be huge and we're sitting around wondering why everyone isn't on board already. The fact is that change is slow and its going to take some time more before Bitcoin actually explodes globally. I'm excited with the lack of resistance we seem to be getting from major players like governments and big finance companies. I expected trouble with US law and companies like Visa and Mastercard or BankAmerica and WesternUnion. Either they are blind to what's about to happen or they have ways to work with it. Banks seem to be excited about the blockchain technology so hopefully they will find a way to work with Bitcoin as opposed to working against it with lobbying and crappy laws to restrict Bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2015-06-20 19:42:15
Agreed. However, the lack of scientific evidence to prove your theory that GMO is harmless is plenty enough reason when you consider the possible impacts GMO can have on your health and the environment.

@_date: 2014-07-08 15:39:49


So if they accept US dollars does this reflect poorly on all Americans? How about the EU? If they took donations in euro would all European nations then become supporters of terrorism or is this only true for Bitcoins?
I think its stupid to say "terrorists accept Bitcoin so Bitcoin is bad" when the reality is they trade in other foreign currencies and no one holds that against them.

Virwox holds funds on initial deposits from credit cards to make sure the cards are not stolen. if you just deposit Bitcoin alone there is no hold at all.

Oops, misunderstood that I suppose. I've never had that issue but your explanation makes sense.
@_date: 2014-09-17 14:19:48
The fees are outrageous but as mentioned its one of the few ways to convert BTC to cash without using a service like LocalBitcoins.com for person to person transfers. In Virwox you cannot convert Bitcoin direct to cash. You have to first convert to Second Life dollars and then convert that to cash or BTC and there are fees on each conversion. In total it will cost more like 7% in total to convert BTC to SLL to USD

You are a big fan of blockchain.info I see. Keep defending them, your money is safe. It appears to me to be one of two things. Either they are being attacked by a competitor to sully their name or someone on the inside figured out a way to enrich themselves. FWIW I think Blockchain.info has a rogue employee who is doing all the stealing. Disclaimer: I lost 8 BTC there because I logged in using Tor.

This is the part that makes no sense. What exactly are we allowed to do with the coins we purchase from them? They are acting more and more like Paypal which prefers you keep  your funds in their network. Cashing out is frowned upon as it upsets their balance of available funds.

According to the article, "Kennedy stands accused of raping five women over the course of eight years and faces a total of 14 charges, 11 of rape, two of assault by penetration and one of causing a woman to engage in sexual activity without consent".
He has more charges than the total number victims so apparently he raped at least one of them more than one time. It could be a case of regret but with five victims that seems less likely.

There are many options and especially so if you like to travel.Take a trip to a casino city and then claim the money as winnings. You don't have to prove where you won it. You'll get hit for taxes hard but the money is clean. 
A better decision would be not to waste it on flashy cars and crap lke that. 1.5 million seems like a lot but it goes fast when you llve that lifestyle. I would leave a good chunk of it in bitcoins because they will increase in value over your lifespan. I would wash a big chunk of it trading altcoins and then claim the rinsed bitcoins as gains and pay tax on that.
I would also stop painting a target on myself with dumb ass posts like this one. You dont have to say so much about where the coins came from and doing so makes me question your opsec and ability to do what you claim to have done.

I have my clients make cash deposits to my business bank account and very rarely are they asked for ID. The primary reason people ask for ID is if the bank account was opened in a different state then where you are making the deposit. What you name the company also seems to help. Banks seem to expect cash deposits for companies like car brokers and moving services and ask fewer questions.

Bitcoins is going to force all payment processors to review their cost of remittance. Why would a business pay the fees for credit card processing when bitcoin is nearly free and unreversable? Bitcoin is also going to upset the so called "high risk markets" like porn and gambling where they can charge as much as 15% in transaction fees. High risk merchant services is big money and bitcoin pretty much destroys that for them.

They are pseudonymous at best and with all the fiat activities taking place on that site there just has to be a trail back to real people. These are not bots or some phantom menace. These are real people in real places and they do in fact answer to someone somewhere. They are also beholden to their users in a certain extent that they must tread lightly in regards to client sentiment in this matter. They may save themselves from a few dirty coins and end up losing a large portion of their user base who can no longer trust Btce to accept and exchange coins freely.

If reselling coins is against the TOS what are we supposed to be buying them for? Are we allowed to "resell" in exchange for goods and services but not fiat? Are we supposed to hodl forever?

Why wouldn't the Feds want a public record like the blockchain?

Having worked in the porn industry one of the most difficult things that many sites have issue with is in securing a quality payment processor that does not screw them on the rates. I think that many major porn providers fear the repercussions of adding bitcoin they may face from their payment processors. I think that until the day bitcoin reaches mass adoption you will find porn companies and even many other merchants hesitant to alienate their merchant services providers and the inherent risk in trying a new technology with such limited adoption. As an example most people still need to use  services like Coinbase etc to purchase bitcoin which they can then use to pay for porn. Why take the unnecessary step of buying bitcoin to use for porn when you can just pay for porn?

I quit using my coinbase account once they required me to verify my identity. It's been idle for some time now but I am seriously considering to just shut it down as I see no point whatsoever in telling them where my coins come from or where they go. What if I sell my coins to some guy who then trades them on LBC? Will I be penalized for where the coins go after I have spent them? If I take payment for services from some guy who's coins are tainted do I pay the penalty for that as well? For all its power and promise there are some serious issues with the blockchain that good old fiat cash has never had to deal with. As long as your deposits are under 10K the bank does not care where cash has been before you got it. Hell at one point wasn't most of the cash in America "tainted" with cocaine and other drugs? The Blockchain never forgets!

Banks don't believe in ethical hackers. You're all crooks as far as they are concerned. Using bitcoins only sounds great but I suspect that a strong percentage of your potential client base will not want to have to go through the trouble of making an account on Coinbase or some other exchange just so they can pay you in bitcoins. I think having both options available would be a better choice for any business at this point. Bitcoin has a bad reputation for many people still and only accepting that as payment is a mistake in my opinion. The only thing most people know about bitcoin is related the many scams, hacks and thefts that have result in millions of lost dollars. While I recognize that bitcoin is superior it is still not widely accepted. You can try accepting both bitcoin and finding another payment processer and offer a discount for payment in bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-07-17 13:29:12


Any proof of that because to many it would appear as if this is exactly what they are doing. Banks are not required to track my usage of funds after I withdraw them and yet evidence shows the companies like Coinbase are doing this exact thing.

BTCE is not actually a bank though and not regulated so their self reporting would then force themselves to fall in line with all other regulation. What qualifies for suspicious coins?

@_date: 2016-07-16 12:38:14
I had an account on Coinbase for over a year. I used it as an affiliate program and drove traffic there for the $75 signup they offered. Eventually I bought some coin using my attached bank account. I transferred the coins to my Trezor, then to Blockchain.info and then to an exchange where I traded it for some altcoins. About 2 weeks later my account was closed with no explanation or reasoning. Coinbase is anti-bitcoin and should be shunned from the industry. Banks are not required to do that much tracking and neither is Coinbase. These nosy bastards are bad for bitcoin.
