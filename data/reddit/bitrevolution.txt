I mean, move your coins form the exchange to an address you control (nano ledger for example). At this point the exchange has no access to your coins. Than backup up your seed in case your nano ledger (or whatever wallet) is lost or destroyed.

Right. And they are the sbb, it's like the government. Anyway average Joe (mr. Bernasconi here) still does not know the sbb sells bitcoin at the machines... next bull run will be crazy

It is the first time that I see it advertised on the vending machine. Normally you have to navigate 2/3 submenus to find It.
@_date: 2018-09-28 15:13:37
No, they advertise different options to buy credit and to send money abroad

In the meantime they coul have accumulated a fortune

In my stupid random mining system there is no hashpower. And only one chain (maybe) 
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:54:10
Doublespend wouldn't be trivial. If a block is invalid other nodes do not accept it. Bit you could easly spam invalid blocks
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:43:38
Hi guys, could a random mining system work? I mean if the miner of the next block is choosen randomly intead of PoW what are the possibile drawback?
@_date: 2018-10-28 11:08:48
Agreed. 
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:52:10
Found the drawback... One hacker could set up millios of nodes and congestion the network mining not valid blocks

Mempool was a bit busy 
Now it should be confirmed
@_date: 2018-10-28 10:50:24
Yes, but you need to work and spend resources. It is very different 
@_date: 2019-10-24 12:07:30
No if the employee does not have the private key
@_date: 2019-06-29 12:35:01
Yes, you are. Just backup your seed and store it properly (offline of course). 
Not sure about xrp. Don't know what level of control Ripple corp have over xrp coins
@_date: 2019-06-29 16:13:03
A seed is a list of 12 or 24 words (depends on the wallet). Write down on a piece of paper and store it in 2 different secure locations

I want to give away some satoshis to some people. I use samurai wallet for small amounts and small purchases but I think that it is a bit too technical for not litterate people and it does not show amount in fiat. Can you suggest a good option for Android and iPhone? I know bread wallet but I do not like that you are exposed to other coins. Something bitcoin only would be better. Thank you

If they could they would invest their own money or borrow some. Why share with you their magic powers?
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:19:23
Just downloaded. It's perfect... just send receive and see your amount. Thank you very much

Please man, all stocks worldwide are overvalued in terms of earnings. Nothing has the upside potential of bitcoin
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:20:11
Thank you. I tried. But still too many not needed stuff like marketplace and buy with cc
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:20:32
I do not get your point
@_date: 2018-07-20 15:22:56
Yes, I love it. I wonder if someone know who and when first posted it
@_date: 2018-07-20 17:13:24
Thank You and thank @_date: 2018-07-26 12:21:35
Price stability in terms of fiat will be never achieved. Price will grow exponentially. 
There will be a certain price stability in terms of goods and services but deflationary anyway.
Disincentives to spend will persist and we will finally exit from this destructive 'consuming is good' paradigma
@_date: 2018-04-27 09:01:32
Same on duckduckgo... reported. Thank you for the suggestion

What was the most important chain reorg on the bitcoin ledger ever made?
@_date: 2019-05-10 17:52:06
So basically altcoins are a defense system of the bitcoin network ��
