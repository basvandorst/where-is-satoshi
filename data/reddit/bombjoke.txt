Btw, what's the short ending to the story of Gavin being convinced by Craig? I missed that. Got busy right after Gavin made the trip to visit him. The popular opinion is that Craig pulled an elaborate trick on Gavin? Did Gavin eventually withdraw his conviction, or he remains uncertain? That was a crazy week.

Hi Paul, 
The first strong and fantastic implications that spring to my mind are the effects on the worlds of marketing, especially advertising, and news/media presentation including their choice of coverage.  These things would (hopefully) be turned on their heads but you have not mentioned them in your bullet points.  Have you thought-experimented what might happen here?
After all, what we believe en masse is in part a function of what these channels feed us.  If the short term would we not expect garbage results out (to the extent that we have garbage in)?

dont start the piece with how it works, where it came from, or how to get some.  start the piece by illustrating all the things we are and will do with it.  dont fail to mention that there is no "them" behind it.

enjoyed all 5 hours of it.  excellent conversation with chrisj.  here's my favorite point ([at 3:39](
"I expect we're going to have hundreds of thousands or millions of coins and currencies because if a 5-yr-old can go online and use a gui to make a coin, youre going to have a joeycoin, a jimmycoin, and mariacoin in your primary school.  and these will not have monetary value.  But here's the thing- we have suddenly disconnected monetary value from the source of the currency.  Monetary value now is an emergent attribute of a currency that reaches a level of transactional volume that is accepted by a broad community.  That's what gives it monetary currency, not who printed it...
"And we're going to be surprised by what currencies achieve value in this new this ecosystem.  Most of them will not.  But what we've seen today is that certain parties are absolutely uncomfortable with the idea that monetary value can emerge as a phenomenon of a complex system based on simple rules rather than be derived from above by fiat.  That new world absolutely terrifies them.  And I feel very comfortable in that new world, and I think a lot of the world outside the US feels even more comfortable with that because they have even less trust of the centralized institutions that print their money because they've seen the history of that."
chrisj, if youre out there, youll enjoy [this eve ensler talk]( not about vaginas, but about our farcical search for the illusion of security (or is that the same thing?).

I used one, in basic I think, that ran on my Tandy model 100. Discovered dozens of fax machines, and a few more interesting things, in 368.

Greed is just an artifact of insisting on the pursuit of security because one has innocently enough been taught that security exists and is deserved when neither are true.  You can get hit by a bus tomorrow.
That typography is super irritating btw.

Agree that wanting new interesting things or experiences is not the same as just wanting more money (or more of what you already have enough of) which is what I see as clutching for security.

Client side can already be accomplished by mounting a real-time encrypted folder inside your dbox folder, right? 
But if you provide server-side encryption then you're providing a key feature you can advertise and use to differentiate. What I would like to see is symmetric key encryption so that my key file is required in the client side in order to decrypt.

it does count, but it doesnt help me.  1- it requires signup and all, so doesnt really save time.  2- more importantly, i cant use gyft.  gyft is not available where i live. not in the play store.  i did manage to load it on my android by having it plugged into laptop while accessing play store via browser on proxy, but it crashes when i try to access the shopping cart.  any thoughts on that?

How does it work? Spits out a private key in qr and you're advised to move it to your own wallet so they aren't liable?

Any of these dbox alternatives mentioned seamlessly store encrypted on the server side similar to how lavabit worked?

Jason, buy a few hundred ltc (not more) and do it all over again.  Seriously.  They're at $10. (Don't even glance at any other coin.)  let them give you a big ride for a year then see where things stand and roll them back into btc if you want.

Couple weeks ago there's a post here where someone laid baited web wallets with passwords off varying strength and then timed how long until they were pilfered. 
Many of those passwords that looked decent were guessed and robbed in seconds. Awesome lab example.

I thought the main reason for voting was that bitcoin would get a big push in use and publicity. If they don't want to, fine. Why so hostile?  Just move on to the next widely used commodity and start suggesting to them. Any suggestions?
