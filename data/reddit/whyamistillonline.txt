Yeah, but it was like this like 20 days ago too. Dropped from 20k to 13k around the 22nd, rose to 16k around Boxing Day and then dropped to 13k again before getting to what it is now. It’s not like it hit an ATH. It’s at a number it was at before. No indication that it won’t repeat the recent trend. I guess I was just expecting a new ATH with the attention this post got.

The title implied, to me, that public interest in Bitcoin picked up again. I viewed it as going down these past few weeks because the price went down durastically and probably turned some people off.
@_date: 2018-01-07 02:30:12
Why is this post getting so much attention right now? The price hasn’t really changed. Am I missing something?
@_date: 2018-01-07 04:38:41
Still, it’s strange. It was at 16k around Boxing Day as well and dipped to 13-14 until now. Just strange that people are so sure of its turnaround when it literally dipped from 20k to 13 a month ago. It’s not like it reached a new high. I get optimism, but this much? Seemed like it would be a sign of more value. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 03:27:13
Bitcoin’s been fluctuating around this price for a few weeks now, though. I check the market prices too often to know.

The crazy part is when you wake up, still groggy, and you see that the price went up 2k overknight. Nothing has completely woken me up faster than that.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:39:09
Yes. I think the fees for buying Bitcoin are fine. It’s the sending fees that will kill you. I sent $32 worth of Bitcoin a couple weeks ago and $17 of it was taken as a fee :/ Stay away from buying Bitcoin to send.

How would you react if you woke up 200 years in the future, everyone you knew is dead, you have no relevant job experience, and Bitcoin has no value?

Oh yeah, he’s having a heart attack right now probably. He finished streaming a little while ago and you know some people in the chat lit him up about it. Someone should have the highlight uploaded soon. 
Did you see [this video]( It was his follow up a day or two after he first bought. It’s pretty funny.

If you’re talking about Binance, you can change it to ETH. Go to the exchange page, and on the right hand side where you see all the different currencies paired with BTC (___/BTC, ___/BTC, etc.), there should be an option right above to switch to ETH. BTC is highlighted in yellow with ETH right beside it.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:51:23


What do you mean by that? Do you think the price is gonna drop big time?
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:32:27
How could it have been back then? The 10k thing is huge and has brought a level of exposure that isn’t even close to 2013. There’s no comparison to its old state, or any other crypto. This is new territory. It’s unpredictable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:02
Good luck! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 15:14:31
Coinmama. I’ve heard bad things about their prices being higher than market, but it’s an option worth looking into.
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:00:00
I remember reading that the two people who created Bitcoin Cash are ex-criminals or something like that. Also one was pretending to be Satoshi (the alias the people who created Bitcoin use, or something like that). It’s also obviously trying to piggyback off of Bitcoin’s success with the name. Going off this information, I don’t see it surviving. If I were you, I’d trade it for BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:20
No problem. Let me know if you need anything else.

Do yourself a favour and put at least half of that in XRP if you get your money back.
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:33:15
I feel your pain man. Something I keep telling myself though is that what Bitcoin is projected to be worth in the long run will make that 2k seem like nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:57:33
2017 was huge for BTC. Crazy to think that 2018 could be even bigger. STRAP IN.
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:49:39
I read that BTC using the Lightning Network will mean that Vertcoin won’t be necessary. Not sure how true that is. Just something for you to maybe look into.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:05:50
2018 has the potential to be HUGE. Jump in as soon as you can.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:36:54
Earlier today I read that it would happen shortly after, if at all. Definitely look into some of those recent "futures" threads on here.
@_date: 2017-12-13 17:14:05
The difference now though is Bitcoin has a much bigger brand and has seen exposure that it didn’t have before. When it broke 10k, that was all over the news. Social media ran with it, and you know how much of an influence social media can have. It’s poised to reach 20k soon, and after breaking 10k a few weeks ago, people are gonna be like, “What? Already?!” and more people will be drawn in. Who knows where it goes from there, but it’s a different animal right now. The Bitcoin brand is huge.
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:39:24
It’s at an all time high right now. Where are you seeing this correction? 
Edit: Nevermind, it’s dropping. God bless.
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:13:06
But things that we spend money on have their own value. The bitcoin is an asset that still applies to your net worth, no? I’m genuinely curious. I’ve been told that, but I’d like to know if it might be wrong.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:45:28
I never bought a huge amount at one time from them, so it wasn’t much. But adding it up over time, maybe. Depends on how desperate you are to get things going...
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:01:49
Looks a hell of a lot like it. Shit is about to get crazy. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:31:40
That’s not how it works. If I spend 10 bucks on a trading card, and for whatever reason the card goes down to only being 5 bucks, you lost money, at least temporarily. OP did lose money. Maybe temporarily, maybe not.

Why are COSS and TenX good investments? Never heard of them. Also, what do you think of IOTA and XRP in regards to your prediction?
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:20:37
Go with Coinbase (verification should be fast) and buy using a Debit/Credit card to get your coins instantly. Buy ETH, not BTC. Then deposit it into GDAX (owned by a Coinbase) for free and then send to Binance. You can send it straight from Coinbase but you’ll be charged a fee. Sending from GDAX results in zero fees for some reason. But yeah exchange ETH for XRP at Binance after. No verification at Binance necessary unless you want to withdraw more than 2 BTC’s worth of coins in a 24 hour period. Let me know if you need any other help.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:19:53
Yeah, I’m thinking buy now and if it dips a lot, great, buy more! No matter how much extra money you think you’re dropping now, it’s going to be nothing compared to what BTC is projected to be worth.
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:40:35
Something tells me we can go higher.
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:54:24
Could either get there must faster or much slower.

Buy now and if it dips buy more.

Thanks for the info about IOTA. 
If Ripple is a bad investment, why do I see it getting so much attention? It ranks in the top 5 or so on every coin market site I’ve been on.
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:39:42
You can get a paper wallet (YouTube has some great videos on the thing), but I wouldn't recommend that long term. A hardware wallet (Trezor/Ledger) will run you around $100 USD/CAD, which isn't much in comparison to how much money you'll be putting into Bitcoin/Crypto long term. It pays for itself.
@_date: 2017-12-06 00:00:27
With the the whole futures thing coming soon and the dip that some people are predicting, is it a good idea to slowly buy bitcoin and see what happens, or not take a chance and just go all out?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:14:42
I’ve seen people explain why what you just said isn’t as bad as it sounds. There’s a process to both. Look into it on the Ripple subreddit.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:55:11
I’ve seen people over at discuss this and it’s not what you think. I’d recommend heading over there to see if you get the full picture. I’m not saying you don’t, I’m just saying it’s a possibility.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:06:41
You’re the first person I’ve seen say that. What’s your reasoning?
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:01:04
A paper wallet can last forever, but there's no way to recover the stored contents if you ever lose any copy you have. A paper wallet is literally just a piece of paper with a QR code and maybe a wallet code (sequence of letters and numbers). There's also a digital wallet that can exist in an application on your desktop. Either of those has its pros and cons. You are far better off getting a hardware wallet though if you are going to be investing a lot of money. Trust me. There's so much security/recovery effectiveness involved.

@_date: 2017-12-06 04:16:38
Not sure what your financial situation is, but I’d say buy now and if it dips a lot, buy more. Obviously your dropping big money now, but when you look at what Bitcoin is projected to be worth, any extra money you’re paying now will be drops in the bucket.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:09:34
Yeah, you do get them instantly. Yeah, I think it’s 3%. Nothing crazy.

Nah, this came from a 3 hour long stream that was completely dedicated to getting into Bitcoin. The stream was actually a pretty funny and entertaining look into someone getting into Bitcoin and other crypto. The stream chat and donation messages were guiding him through it. Here’s the link to it:  it starts at 1:20.
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:20:36
Because it’s a growing coin, and it’s still in the beginning stages. Two “non-bank, household name” partnerships are going to be announced soon, addition to Coinbase is heavily expected in the beginning of 2018, and is a bank coin that processes 1500 transactions a second while Bitcoin is 6 and Ethereum is 15 iirc. Look into it! Head over to and check out some articles. [Here’s one I read the other day]( It’s a good start.

I don’t live in Cali, but I doubt that’ll affect you at all.
@_date: 2017-12-02 02:03:12
Then stick to a paper wallet. If you decide to invest more, think about a hardware wallet.

Buy a Trezor or Ledger Nano, and it's as simple as plugging the thing into your computer via USB, downloading the software, setting up your pin and 24 word recovery sequence, then transferring your Bitcoin to the wallet using the website. There are tutorials on YouTube, I'm sure. I bought a Trezor and transferred Bitcoin from Coinbase, Just like you'll be doing, so I have the experience you're looking for. It's an easy process! Watch some YouTube videos, and if you end up buying and have any further questions, I should be able to help you. Good luck!
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:01:47


That’s a really good idea. Something I didn’t think about. I’m with you on that one. 
@_date: 2017-12-05 13:25:37
That’s not true. There’s nothing wrong with telling your friend how much you have. Obviously it depends on your relationship with someone, but we have no reason to not give OP the benefit of the doubt here.

A big issue I’ve heard about Coinbase is people wiring in money from their bank, it not showing up for longer than expected, and then not being able to get a response from their support team.

I read that the 55 billion they own are in escrow, and they can only realease a maximum of a billion a month. Also, I read that it’s in their best interest to keep the price high for liquidity’s sake.

Have you tried Quadriga? It’s the leading exchange in Canada.
@_date: 2017-11-30 02:03:26
I don't think that's the best example.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:27:35
Yes, but I'm asking *why* people are buying so much right now. There's usually a reason for every hike or drop.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:43:07
Why is the price shooting up so fast recently? Obviously people are buying, but there's gotta be more to it. Is it going to drop?

You go to Quadriga, click/hover over your Bitcoin total (should be a gold coin with 0.0000 XBT next to it, followed by an orange arrow) and a drop-down menu should show up, saying "Fund Account". Click that, and you should be brought to a new page that shows a QR Code (looks like [this]( Copy that. 
Go into CoinBase, go into your Bitcoin wallet, and there should be a paper airplane in the top right corner. On the new screen, you should be able to enter the amount of bitcoin/cash you want to send. Click SEND. There should be a To: section now, and to the right of it, paste the QR code. It should be a long sequence of numbers and letters. That's fine. Once you do that, click Send in the top right corner, and that should be it. The transfer should take ~10 minutes, and you can even see it pending on the Quadriga website on the page where you got the QR code in the beginning. Just refresh the page if it's not showing up. It should show "Confirmations" with a number below it. That number will slowly go up, with the final one being 4. 
Hope that solves everything!!! Feel free to contact me if you have any other questions and I'll do my best to help! :)
Edit: I should mention that the CoinBase part of this is through the app!

I guess it it's difficult for you to understand that they were clearly just asking how to transfer funds to Quad from CB. Really no need to be a dick. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:36:10
If you are buying $1000 of any Crypto currency, throw that shit into a hardware wallet (Trezor or Ledger recommended) asap. Don't risk something like this.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:17:58
It's always a good time. It's only going to grow in the near future, so you're going to make money back. It seems as though it's really starting to make it into the mainstream now, seeing as it hitting 10k made the news around the world in some capacity. Now is a good time to jump on!
