What would have to happen for Bitcoin to count as a true currency?  I'm not sure how cash isn't just "a fabricated asset that is primarily speculated upon and often used for barter."
Honest question here.

I think what I wrote was pretty even handed.  News magazines should be judged by what they put on the cover.  It reflects the supposed values MSM vehicles claim puts them in a superior position over bloggers and "hypersensitive and unstable" "people on the Internet."  In this case, the Bitcoin cover story suggests Newsweek isn't capable.  Instead of burying the story somewhere as a respectable attempt, Newsweek editors chose to showcase it.  What they showcased was their incompetence.
I hoped that was calm enough for you.  I tried to type it extra slow.
I am personally not going to kill Newsweek.  But if it dies, so be it, and thanks for all the fish.

If it was just musings on a personal blog, I'd have to agree.  But this was an attempt to use sensationalism and a flimsy story to re-float a dead MSM vehicle.  Instead of meaningful insight born of mature and responsible professional journalism backed by editorial integrity (adda yadda yadda), we got more proof that journalism is dead. 
We need to kill Newsweek.

Not just "one article I didn't like" but the front page story.
Am I subject to a moral, or legal obligation to support Newsweek?  No. 
It was always crap.  Now it's crap again.  
Newsweek is reaping what it sows.
