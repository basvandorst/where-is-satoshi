switching to micro-BTC seems like too big of a split right now.
I think we should do a 1,000-for-1 split.  And just call it a "bitcoin".  Anyone who owns a whole bitcoin today would own 1 kBTC tomorrow.
@_date: 2014-08-31 11:58:34
The split I'm proposing doesn't need 100% adoption to work.  Just a large majority of users.
Its functionally the same thing as switching to "bits".  I'm just talking about changing the name for that unit to "Bitcoin" in common parlance.  It would be fine if a small minority cringed to the existing denomination of "Bitcoin".  Its just a discrepancy of language at that point.
I think its important for the base unit of Bitcoin to be the common linguistic denominator we use to count.  We typically talk about US Dollars in terms of dollars.  Why talk about Bitcoins in terms of fractions of Bitcoins?

Forget the "bit".  The unit needs to be a Bitcoin.
1000-for-1 split.  One bitcoin today equals one kilobitcoin tomorrow.
Nobody wants to own fractions of things.  As long as there's a bigger "primary" unit, the psychological resistance will hold.

@_date: 2014-02-25 08:44:00
Actually, yes it is too hard for most novice Bitcoin users.  That's the problem.
I'm not defending their behavior, but its much easier to buy coins on Coinbase and just keep them there.
Until someone offers an easy-to-use service where Bitcoins are stored by default in cold storage, people will continue storing coins in Web wallets.
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:00:14
That's not what I'm advocating.  I'm merely saying that paying with Bitcoin is a far more complex process than using a credit card.
Bitcoin at this stage is more like a backbone transaction network — something like ACH.  Someone needs to make it consumer friendly — just like Visa has done ontop of the legacy banking infrastructure.
QR codes are awful.  They're incomprehensible to everyone except highly technical people.
@_date: 2014-04-15 01:29:59
First of all, I'd have to have a funded Bitcoin wallet on my phone.  If you use an iPhone, you're out of luck.  And even on Android, funding that wallet is a huge pain.
With a Visa card, I can fill out an application online.  As soon as the card arrives I can make purchases on credit.  No bank transfers required until the end of the month.
Once I get my wallet funded, it's still a pain to use a QR code.  I have to:
1. Unlock the phone
2. Find the app &amp; open it  
3.  Probably enter a password   
4.  Tap a "pay" button  
5. Align the camera to the QR code  
6.  confirm the details   
7.  wait about 30 seconds, even with 0-confirmation transactions
Typing in 16 digits sounds easier.  And having my CC information saved on a site like Amazon makes it even easier.
Look, I'm a huge Bitcoin fan too.  But the community has a big blindness when it comes to Bitcoin's shortcomings.  The only way to fix them is to acknowledge them and work on solutions. 
@_date: 2014-04-14 23:26:56
Yep.  I used it to make an in-person transaction back when it was still available for iPhone.
Still not as good as handing the cashier my Visa, and (sometimes optionally) signing a receipt.

Absurdly low transaction volume here. Only 43.5 BTC 
@_date: 2015-05-13 00:55:07
Hmm, so an attacker could effectively raise transaction fees by spamming txns?
Assume a malicious entity had $250,000.00 USD and wanted to disrupt the blockchain. At current rates, that's 1035 BTC. Assuming a transaction fee of 0.0001BTC, that would be 10,350,000 spam transactions.
Would that mess anything up? Thanks for your patience here btw, just trying to learn more about this.
@_date: 2014-11-03 06:17:08
Transaction volume isn't the same as trade volume.  I'm a bull as well, but the signal to watch out for is when fiat to btc volume picks up.
@_date: 2015-05-13 01:07:09
Hmm, this seems like an alarming possibility. Looking at the number of txns per day graph: 
10,000,000 transactions would be almost 100X the highest volume day recorded on this graph. Split that across, maybe 3 days. Assume the attacker has a financial motive to see Bitcoin fail and has lots of resources. $2.5MM to shut down the network for a month, $5MM for two months. Wouldn't that completely destroy confidence in BTC?

I'm tired of all the straw man attacks on Coinbase in this sub. Yes, it is a hosted Bitcoin service. No, you don't own the private keys (unless you use multisig). We get it. You're beating a dead horse. We don't need a new Coinbase flame post every single day.
This specific gripe is a feature, not a bug, and has been part of Coinbase since nearly the beginning. If you don't like the features Coinbase has built on top of Bitcoin, don't use Coinbase. That's the wonderful thing about Bitcoin.
But honestly, you should be thankful that Coinbase has opened up Bitcoin to a much broader audience. Coinbase is probably the easiest onramp to Bitcoin. If you want this thing to go mainstream we're going to need players like Coinbase.
They've also been meaningfully engaging with regulators and legislators, fighting in Bitcoin's self interest. 
@_date: 2015-05-12 17:04:06
Sure, I get that. But what if billions of checksum hashes are published to the blockchain? Or perhaps some malicious entity tries to write as much spam data into the chain as possible?

@_date: 2015-01-20 06:45:20
This is a really important critique. It bothers me that most people here are immediately jumping into full-on defensive mode.
Bitcoin is difficult to use, period. 2015 needs to be the year we embrace ease-of-use. If not, we start the slow decline into irrelevance.
That's going to mean compromising on a few things. We need to embrace hosted wallets. They offer features that decentralized solutions can't. They've been the ones that have pushed Bitcoin to be easier to use — but the community still hates on them. In 2015 we need to see even more ease-of-use features like sending Bitcoin to any phone number via SMS. You can't do that with the native protocol—you need services built on top.
@_date: 2015-01-11 22:53:14
Absolutely they're spending too much. They don't make money. $0.00 a month and 0% transaction fees. They charge for support.
I bet they go out of business late this year, or early 2016. 
I'm bullish on Bitcoin, but that doesn't mean that every business built on Bitcoin is a good one.

@_date: 2015-01-29 03:51:01
This is not the most important design consideration for Bitcoin.
Realistically: the most important UX hurdle is a universal addressing/identity system. Onename doesn't look like it will get close to 100% adoption, so its not useful. We probably need to figure out how to use phone numbers as addresses — either in a decentralized way or through one of the centralized mobile wallets.
@_date: 2015-05-12 01:35:45
The biggest reason it's not taking off with the mainstream in any market is simple: Bitcoin is still too difficult to use.

Entirely depends upon the average LTV of the customers who come in. Some customers will only buy $100 worth of Bitcoin once. Others may buy, sell, buy, sell, etc and rack up tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands in transaction volume. A whale might do $1MM+ in transactions over the customer lifespan. Coinbase takes 1% of all of those fiat-btc exchanges.
So it's possible that the average LTV of new customers who buy more than $100 in BTC is worth close to $75. 
Also, referral programs like this provide incentives for third parties to run ads for Coinbase signups on FB / Twitter / Google / etc.  Those ads potentially expose the Coinbase brand to millions. The vast majority of those exposures don't convert to a signup, but over time they may. Either way, Coinbase doesn't need to run those ads — other people will line up to do that work for them.
Finally, sometimes these programs make sense to drive momentum, even if they don't pay off over the lifetime of a customer. Coinbase could run this program for a few months, generate a lot of new signups, then scale back referrals and depend more on organic growth that was kicked off by paid growth. PayPal did this back in the day:

They do all of those things because they are legally required to under AML / KYC laws in the US. If they don't, the founders could go to prison. Ask Charlie Shrem if you think Coinbase has any choice in whether or not to report suspicious transactions.
If you don't want the general public using Bitcoin, fine. I suppose that's a legitimate opinion to hold. If you do, and I think most of the community does, then any company providing the services that Coinbase does will be forced to abide by AML / KYC.

Some of it is dogmatism. Lots of members of the community hate Coinbase b/c they see it as centralization atop a decentralized infrastructure.
But Coinbase and their ilk have genuinely pushed things forward. They've made Bitcoin way easier to use.
The honest answer to your question is more insistence on ease of use. Even at the expense of decentralization.
We need to be able to send Bitcoin over SMS using Coinbase, Circle, Xapo, etc. We need to be able to on-board a new Bitcoin user in just a few taps. We need to nail the basics.
I think we've gotten way ahead of ourselves—focusing too much on daydream possibilities for the blockchain. There's plenty of simple, obvious ease-of-use problems that need to be tackled first.
@_date: 2015-02-08 10:49:33
Yes, I would call that extremely convoluted. Love that you'd go through that process to spread BTC, but you shouldn't have to.

@_date: 2015-02-07 22:40:32
Undoubtably, the dollar bill.
This isn't a fair test, in many ways. But it does highlight a lot of problems in the Bitcoin ecosystem.
1: QR codes suck. Like it or not they've become a branding element for Bitcoin. That's bad.
2: It's hard to redeem &amp; spend Bitcoin. Let's say I want to take that BTC. First I need a (mobile) wallet, which I need to download. Then if I want to send it to a friend, none of the major wallets support SMS sending — I need to know their BTC address or email. With the dollar I just take it and hand it to a friend.
3: .045 sounds like a crappy amount. We need to move the decimal point for BTC. I don't think displaying prices in uBTC is sufficient. (In fact, I think uBTC moves the decimal point *too* far)

mBTC doesn't get around the psychological barrier — Most people don't want to own a 'milli' of anything, they want whole numbers.  And no other money system uses decimal prefixes.
I'm a big fan of calling 0.01BTC a 'bit'.  100 bits to a Bitcoin.
'bitcent' would be my second choice.

Beautiful machine.  But cash to BTC seems like a novelty at best.  Most people I know don't carry a ton of extra cash around — they carry it only to spend at merchants that don't take credit cards.

@_date: 2013-12-04 04:16:41
I think we should do a proper 1000-for-1 split and just call them 'Bitcoins' instead of 'milli Bitcoins'.
