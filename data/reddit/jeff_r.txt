In the same boat...I figure I'm slightly losing even with a 286gh miner running at 320w.  
That's not taking into consideration hardware depreciation, combating the heat it produces with AC, the lan bandwidth, or the cost of the space it occupies in my work area.

Yeah, but if they used bitcoin directly there would be no way for them to premine, or control the exchange rate / utilize another scam against their own residents. 
Also, the blockchain would provide a perfect ledger of all transactions....no one needs that because the leaders have always been so good at making sure all the money is accounted for at all times.  /s
I have a bad feeling that adding a layer of obfuscation of a fabricated alt-coin is only for the personal gain of a few individuals.
Bitcoin would provide them with an amazing opportunity to add integrity to their budgets/bookkeeping, transact without interference with the entire world, be their own bank etc. I would love to see it come to fruition.

Also, it is very misleading...try making micropayments using debit. You are giving away more like 20% of your revenue if you are a coffee shop for example. 
$1.50 cup of coffee, $0.30 fee per transaction.
Debit is great if the customers are buying some thing ~$20 or more. Even then it is still 1.5%.
Not to mention the entry requirements. 
Has anyone here ever tried to get a POS device or filled out a payment gateway application?
At one time ~10 years ago they wanted a $50k bond.
Even now, payment processor gateways for small business can be very difficult to obtain without a lot of red tape, sometimes account set up fee's....

Because accepting the possibility of a small loss for the time being is better than getting stuck as a bag holder when they inevitably shutter their doors?
The reason their price is so high is because there is excess demand for bitcoin there. People can't get their money out in good time so they buy bitcoin and transfer it out. Even that can take a day or more according to recent posts.

They aren't interested in manipulating the price or disrupting it per se....they are simply wolves laying in wait, slipping past everyone's defences, building our confidence and trust in them and creating plausible online profiles so no one suspects who they are. 
Then when they need to...they have assets on the inside of our community they can use to further their eventual agenda. 
 
Right now I believe that agenda isn't the destruction of bitcoin, it is simply surveillance and identification of individuals involved in illegal activities. 
Eventually we may see more active agents provocateurs type behaviours....people you think are friends online asking you to do something sketchy possible illegal...next thing you know you are in jail for being an unlicensed money transmitter or whatever.

@_date: 2014-01-05 22:33:17
I'd love to help you...my first recommendation....scrap the alt and use litecoin or bitcoin. 
Invest in a reserve currency of a substantial amount of litecoin/bitcoin because the growth is going to make everyone involved rich in the next few years. 
Use the blockchain like everyone else to conduct transactions inside reserves, and in trading outside the reserve. Avoid USD/CAD as much as possible to become debt free and totally banking self sufficient. 
Everything is already in place to make it happen, you gain nothing from premining and using your own alt. I "get" the idea of having your own sovereign currency, but it isn't "more useful" in this context...it just feeds isolationism and allows toe holds for people that would do you economic harm. 
I'm actually excited for what IS possible for our first nations people if they decide to go the correct route...how that happens is up to you.  
@_date: 2014-07-06 13:44:10
Based on this graph, we can see that it is increasingly difficult to hold them past 18-24 months.
I  believe it is due to the fact that at the 18-24 month period, the bitcoin holder has gone through 2-3 peaks and has made a substantial amount of a nest egg. The weight of that risk becomes to great and they choose to sell off some of that wealth via Risto's SSS or some other percentage. They wish to take some profit so they can relax and enjoy their new wealth. 
I believe this is also the mechanism that will eventually counter the argument that bitcoin wealth is "too concentrated".

If non-early adopters want coins they can get them on or off exchange for a fair price.

They tried hard here in Canada to shut down CAVirtex access to the bank system. They found a private banking partner that so far couldn't be bullied into denying them service. 
If that happens, the companies will find a way around it...the legacy banking system has too many holes in it to seal itself off completely from bitcoin. There is always a small private bank that needs the business and will be interested in a few million dollars of cashflow.

Not really, we have this beautiful thing here in Canada called small claims court. You can literally sue someone for up to $50k for about $150 in court costs to have the judge hear your case. 
Lawyers are basically frowned upon....sort of like bringing a gun to a knife fight. Although you can certainly pay for your lawyer to help you prep for the finer points of the law.
I think in this case they would subpoena them to court....Robo-idiots wouldn't show up and the judgement would go for the plaintiff immediately. Even if they did show the judge would crucify them based on what I read.
They could also get costs to appear, their shipping back, rent agreement costs.
They would likely get everything back they paid. 
The flipside of this is that they still may never pay them...but you could turn it into a judgement and eventually an arrest warrant on Josh. If he stepped foot in Canada they would arrest him at the border until it was paid. It depends if he cares to ever go to Canada again.

I know right....and the "article" misses the other half(s) of the cycle. 
1. Coinbase sells the bitcoins to someone else (and they frequently run out of stock so that isn't even in question).
2. The original purchaser often puts cash money into their account and buys back on exchange to replace the small amount of bitcoin they just spent.
No matter how they try to spin it...using bitcoin to purchase products doesn't remove capital form the bitcoin side of the equation, it actually brings new capital into the cycle.  (Maybe not 100% of the purchase but some percentage of the purchase price is introduced as new cash into the system.)

According to my spreadsheet calculations it costs ~$485 in electricity to produce one bitcoin...co-generation can offset some of that loss but you simply are better off buying a bitcoin every month at this price and paying for gas to heat your home.
If you have a house that only has electric heat...maybe you can try to directly offset some of the monthly cost. 
The other question is...what is the efficiency of a bitcoin miner vs a conventional space heater in terms turning joules into heat? 
It shouldn't be too far off but it is still of interest.

MT Gox is not advertising that it takes two days to get your coins transferred out...that information is on bitcointalk from people complaining about the time delay. 
You CANNOT GET CASH out of Mt Gox into your bank acct in less than "weeks" in most cases. If you have a Japan bank acct it wasn't bad for the past 6 months but now we are hearing it is very slow for everyone, up to a month to get your funds even with a hundred emails to their tech support complaining. 
Go to bitcointalk and read a bit about MT Gox service and you will see why everyone is getting their cash and coins out asap. If you did it yesterday it was ~$920....today it is ~$1k because people are starting to panic to get out.

They try to do this to us here in Canada also but usually you can force them to accept it. 
I guess the difference is that the law is written to enforce the use of currency, not the use of certain denominations. 
I think if you said something like "we no longer trust the US dollar, so USD no longer accepted" and only started accepting gold and silver or bitcoin (just as an example) you would be on contravenance of the law. 
Whereas I guess the shop holders have some right not to accept large denomination bills...which I don't fully accept as a valid reason to refuse legal tender as payment but hey that's what the cool thing about reddit is....we don't all have to agree.

Internet 50/month, cell phones about the same 
Food is average $200 per week.

Totally wrong and a stupid hypothesis...this was about manipulation and accumulation and nothing more. It was designed to drive the price down and that is all.

Wow, I was right on the money with that prediction...this is doomed right from the beginning. The perception of fairness is lost right from the first coin.
100m coins premined.
50m for a reserve fund
50m for "grants", haha. 
And then released to the public to be mined, traded etc. 
All they need to do now is to control the fiat to coin rate and they have total control over the economy of their people. 
I guess it has benefits similar to a sovereign nation type currency...they can inflate it or deflate it at will etc. but this has so many possibilities/probabilities for corruption. 
The best thing they could do is use either bitcoin or a legit alt like litecoin, purchase a reserve currency of them at a good rate and act as their own bank. Ride the increasing value over the next couple of years and that will satisfy their economic needs at the same time as giving them sovereign control over their money and internal economy. As the crypto they use gains in popularity they also would increase their trading power in the new global crypto economy. 
By creating their own alt they are isolating themselves from the growth in the growing crypto economy. Who else is going to use this except themselves?

I obviously do not mean to apply faith to the fact that economy exists.
We have an economy for the basic reasons that have existed throughout time, supply and demand. 
The operation of the economy has little to do with whether or not there is a USD, nor what it is worth. You are confusing the medium of exchange vs the economy itself. (We could switch to bitcoin for all transactions tomorrow and your Starbucks card and credit cards would still work perfectly.) 
However, faith (and gov't decree) must be applied in order to believe that any fiat currency is worth something. 
The only thing that makes a piece of paper worth 1 USD is that you and I agree on that concept, and that both of us have faith that it wont be worthless tomorrow.  (regardless of gov't decree, see Zimbabwe) 
Once that faith is eroded, you have a piece of paper again. 
I would argue that faith in the USD is at an all time low right now...if it wasn't supported by a big stick it would be worthless. 
Unfortunately you can't use brute force to convince people to have faith in something. They may facetiously agree with you in order to stop the violence, but they don't have true faith. I believe this is the "stockholm syndrome" stage we are at with the current USD.

I speculate on the price of the US dollar all the time. Every time I buy or sell gold and silver it is different. 
Every time I order something from the US or sell something to a US customer the price in my home currency is different. 
You do it as well, you just haven't considered it well enough. When you buy a gallon(?) of gas sometimes you pay more or less for that economic unit. Lately the amount of gas you get for $1 usd has been dropping and dropping. The gas station and yourself agree that a usd is worth 1/4 of a gallon, and they have faith they can deposit it in the bank and that tomorrow they can pay their supplier to replenish that saleable economic unit. 
We all agree on the value of the dollar every time we use it. 
We have faith we can get an economic unit of something for it when we need to.  Food, gas, clothing, shelter. 
Every day it is worth less and less. It has lost around 99% of it's buying power in the past 100 years...

Less than 1 "milli" per day...more like a few Satoshi's.  
0.00000707 BTC per day at 335mh or in about 3 years you would have 7 "milli".
1 milli  is what 47 cents? 
So you would make about $1.50 per year. 
Electricity costs....about $5 per year at 5w...and you need a host to run it. 
Even a Raspi is adding some electricity cost. 
So, basically you put $5 bills in, and get $1 bills out.

The cap of $3k is how much capital loss deduction you can use to offset "regular income". ie. from a day job or whatever your income situation is. That doesn't mean it can't offset other gains by 100%, ie stock market gains or other capital gains. 
So, you lost $50k on bitcoin this year but gained $50k in the stock market? Enjoy not paying capital gains taxes.
Also, if you don't sell you don't incur gains or losses...so you can defer those gains year to year by holding.

Adding a power supply alone doubles the cost of the mining equipment...then add duty and shipping. 
And yes you have to account for depreciation...otherwise that money you invested in hardware just disappears. It is a part of the cost of every coin mined. 
You pay $4k for a miner that mines for 6 months before losing profitability, you can then sell it for maybe a few hundred to recoup your hardware cost. If the miner mines 10 btc in that time, you just spent $400 for each coin in terms of hardware alone. Now add your $145 electricity cost, $200 for a power supply, $400 for duty and shipping....mining starts to look stupid now doesn't it? 
$145 estimate is naive.

Perhaps you can consider the costs associated with:
Case 1: Running a personal miner in an existing basement.
Buy overpriced miner, $1500 per TH...wait 6 months watching the diff rise before it arrives
buy a power supply
plug it in to existing 110v power (that you possibly don't even pay for) and a lan cable.
Sell your coins on the market  
possibly break even given no electricity or cooling costs....but profit is very doubtful at $420 anyway.
Case 2: Renting an industrial facility
sign a one year lease...$3-5 per sq ft
liability insurance (no one will let you do this in their building without it)
Buy bulk miners at manufacturing cost...maybe $150 per TH, wait 6 months watching the diff rise before they arrive. (the only thing you can do cheaper than home use)
Buy bulk power supplies...(did you know a 2000w power supply for a 3TH unit is up to $2k?)
Due to enormous power supply requirements...you now have to pay for a massive transformer and it's installation
Hire electricians wiring the industrial unit for power and networking (to code because no landlord or hydro 
company will give you a clean inspection to turn it on otherwise) Oh and btw are all those units you are plugging in labelled with CSA/UL/CE approvals? No? Now you have to pay for an inspection and approval. Little details like highpot tests, grounding tests, emf interference... Give us ten units to test/destroy and wait a month and we will give you CSA/UL approval for them...until then, leave the power off.
server racking for the units, labour to screw racking together install units and plug them in
electricity to power the units and cool the units (electricity per kw is cheaper but due to cooling overhead it is doubled)
babysit it 24/7...so 3x employee's (even if you count as one it is still a cost)
Try to make a deal to sell your btc off market for a premium to someone who doesn't want to have their demand push the price up....
impossible to make a profit at $420.

I agree you could rent an apartment but a car is a basic necessity here due to the vast distances between everything and the lack of a useful mass transit system (unless you live in a downtown area). 
A basic apartment in my town is a good $1500 per month, for something that 4 people could live in. An average mortgage is $2k-2500 per month for a working class house. 
Minimum wage here is $10.25 per hour and there is a lot of debate right now about raising it to $14 per hour because there is literally no way a person can survive on that income in terms of food and housing. 
$130 per month to survive is mind blowing to me...if you had that little money here in Canada you would be homeless and basically barely able to eat on a daily basis. We give people $1000+ per month social assistance if they are unable to work or find a job. That isn't enough to live alone, you would have to share a room in a house with others in order to live/eat.

I don't know your business...but holding bitcoin should never be permitted threaten your cash flow too badly...if it does, then I would recommend selling as soon as you receive the coins to minimize your exposure and only holding an amount that doesn't present a threat.

I have a spreadsheet that is about the best approx. anyone can make at the production cost of a bitcoin....it is saying that the cost using the best commercially available hardware is about $485. 
So, unless the OP is KNC or ASICMiner and can produce his own chips...it is not profitable for anyone reading this. 
The reason the difficulty is where it is...you are correct it is a feedback loop...but we have overshot quite a lot due to earlier greed. To produce and deliver mining hardware takes about 3-6 months. 
People who have already ordered and paid for their equipment have no choice to turn it on when it arrives in order to try (in vain) to recover their upfront costs. Hence why we have such a huge overshoot. 
As far as large scale mining farms...they have a significant advantage...they are mining at a loss right now hoping for two things. 
1. The other companies/individuals stop mining or introducing new hardware.
2. The price goes through the roof again.

You were close with this one, I see you angling towards a % GDP reference. (Sum value of the country's assets is completely off base.) However, it isn't mathematically locked in value to debt % of GDP...it also floats based on the faith of the rest of the entire world. And we are seeing a startling lack of faith these days. Every regime that has questioned the faith in the US dollar by selling oil for gold etc. has been toppled in past years and their leader assassinated. When so called faith needs to have such a strong stick behind it...

"not talking about the initial investment for buying those machines"....
There is your problem right there....how about you recalculate that cost per coin including the cost of buying the hardware. 
(Since it is being depleted every difficulty increase as well.)
Even if you could get them right now...you would need 9 Antminer S4's at $1250 each. ($11250)
Add taxes and delivery in your country and they are closer to $1500 each. ($18000).
(I'm guessing though that your particular hardware was around 1.5-2.0x that price since recently available hardware was like $4000 for 3TH. You would need 6 of these....$24000.)
If we very optimistically estimate that they will mine for you for a year then you have a very simplified hardware depreciation of $1500 per month.

Well, you are kind of arguing a catch22 regarding the cost of goods sold. 
Saying they won't lower prices is jaded but reasonable...but many costs raise the price before we even see it. All the costs associated with bringing a good to market and selling it contribute to the final cost of the product. 
You wouldn't argue that other costs do not add to the COGS. 
shop lifting
employee theft
POS fee's
website costs
If their costs lower do they lower the price at the till? I believe they do in the case of competing with other firms selling the same goods. When it comes to online shopping the lowest "price to my door" almost always wins even if it is $1. I believe it is only if a company has a monopoly that perhaps we do not see the price get lowered in relation to lowered costs.

No, he wasn't prosecuted for the crime I'm talking about.
He was prosecuted for selling shares in a company that wasn't registered to the SEC. And paid a pittance of a fine compared to the couple million he made screwing the shareholders behind their backs.
I believe the SEC may still be investigating the self dealing or however you want to term it that occurred when he instituted a forced buyback, (I'll admit at 3-4x share value at the time) and then turned around the very next day and sold the company to a third party...for probably 10-12x valuation. 
He in essence saw an opportunity to cut the shareholders out of potential profits in the sale of the company which was impending at the time.
He has never been prosecuted or charged in accordance with that activity....that share buyback and resulting sale is the reason everyone here that was involved or knows what happened hates that asshole.

I would think that the miners would be universally against it...
Here is my thinking. 
If the 1mb blocks are all full, and transactions are backlogged...bitcoin network users will have to pay more in terms of transaction fees in order to get their transactions through promptly. 
Higher transaction fee's = more profit for miners. 
@_date: 2015-08-15 22:36:05
I agree, altruistically the expansion of bitcoin is in everyone's interests...as long as they care about bitcoin.
I would theorize that there are a lot of miners that are only interested in one thing...profit. We can only count on their greed not their altruism.
Edit: I still mine...although at this point it IS out of altruism. I can see however that the mining landscape has changed in the past year to large centralized mines that don't give a shit other than in regard to profit.

True, larger blocks do mean more transactions in each block...hopefully with more transactions fee's attached. 
I think that with larger blocks, if transactions are being cleared within the first available block every time...why would the users pay fee's at all?
Each block mined would be still 25xbt, with some drivel of additional fee's like we see now (or possibly less)...yet the data usage of the miner has gone up in cost for sure by up to 8x.

From my experience with the last three peaks...for the next run up take whatever number you've calculated/predicted and double it, then do it again until you've hit a number that makes you say to yourself "No fucking way..that's absolutely impossible."...now you are getting close to what the next ATH will be.

I don't see where he mentioned "authorities" in that statement. 
Anonymity is also important on a peer to peer level. 
If I buy a coffee from you...you shouldn't be able to easily see that I have a balance of xxx bitcoins sitting in that address. That's just dangerously stupid. 
Address reuse at least gives you obfuscation with of a diverse number of addresses along that chain that can't be easily traced back to yourself as your balance. 
 
I already believe that the "authorities" have methods of tracing the movement of all bitcoins...using nation state level spy tools...linking IP addresses and bitcoin addresses they can already tie our transactions and balances with a high degree of accuracy. 
I behave under the assumption that I have a fair level of anonymity from the average joe or business on the street...while not trusting for one second that I have any anonymity from any nation state / spy agency.

Yes, theoretically if you ran it a whole year you get a 1:1297 chance to hit gold that year. 
Unfortunately by the end of the year that 1:1297 will be something a magnitude worse in terms of odds. Right now we have relative difficulty stagnation, but if we ever have another UDS/XBT price peak the difficulty will go through the roof again. 
Oh and that number 1:1297 is an absolute. You may get lucky and find a block in the first hour/day/week. 
Technically it would be quite likely to find it in the first 700 years...51% and all that...or if you were unlucky it could take all 1297 years to hit a block. 
I hit a block in 4 months of mining at 285gh/sec  back in 2013 on Gigavps pool.

Tap to pay in Canada is pretty fast but people don't seem to understand that it comes with a lack of security and as you mentioned, the liability is now shifted to the merchant. 
The merchant sets a limit as to the amount of transaction they are willing to accept the liability for in the case of a charge back. Too many charge backs? The merchant more directly raises their prices or lowers their max liability setting. 
Most stores I've gone to are $50 or $100 maximum for the tap to pay.

They are blocked from telling us about the warrants but what about the lack of warrants? ie. They could put up a sign that says "Today there were no DOJ warrants presented or enforced." or "XXX days warrant free!".
@_date: 2015-04-20 09:07:11
No...well you are partially right. 
Heat is one immediate form of energy output, hashing is another form - electrical impulses in a cable, and light is yet another...however if you analyse the equation on a long enough time basis, all these forms eventually convert to heat. (But not all of them are converted to heat inside the house.)
A space heater on the other hand converts most of it's output to heat, and perhaps a little to the visible/infrared part of the spectrum. (which then almost immediately degrades to heat when it hits a surface) There is no electrical energy output in terms of communications.
They are not all forms of "heat" at the moment the miner is done with them though.

Well in all fairness the password in this case would likely be that each transaction is cryptographically signed by the bank branch with an address they hold the private key to for said purpose.

They can probably post an absence of warrants but it may still be seen by a judge as breaking a bench order "in spirit"...no telling what they could do. 
I would prefer to see a system where access to user account info (even just viewing) would change a checksum or time calculation that would be reported as non-matching to the user. 
The act of even logging in to even view user data would alter a google auth type counter that could not be reset server side. If the user logs in and see's the values no longer match they know their account has been accessed.

You are buying "stock" in a company that gives you no ownership and no voting rights for that class of "stock", and no guaranty of repayment or dividends....tell me why this has value again?
Sounds like a free loan for the company and a slight possibility that my investment may be worth more one day.

Is that a double negative? Seriously though...on one hand a node costs say $10 a month to run....on the other there is no person financial benefit to doing so. 
We can't count on altruism to run a network...we have to be able to count on people's greed...then success is guaranteed.
@_date: 2015-03-29 15:48:42
Look I'm a huge supporter of bitcoin...and I'm currently mining at home as well...I have been involved for two years, closer to three.
But the fact is that running a node is simply an "at cost" situation...we have to be able to count on people's greed to make the network run, not altruism. 
If they had more strictly combined these two activities right from the beginning, we would have 150,000 nodes right now but as it is we only have 6200 people who are interested in running a node with little or no financial benefit to themselves.
I GET that we need nodes...but 6200 is enough to easily support the network, actually we only need a couple to run a network as it is right now so 6200 is overkill.

What would happen if you woke up tomorrow and your bank account was cut in half or the decimal moved over one place....you call the bank and they say no sorry you re wrong..the value is exactly what it is supposed to be, no mistakes on their part, sorry. You have no proof, no serial numbers, nothing...you just have to trust the bank that their records are accurate since you have no proof or serial numbers on your money and their books are not open for you to audit without a judges order. 
Or your govt decides to pull a bail-in and take 3/4 of the money in your bank account or retirement savings...as we have seen happen twice in the past few years already. 
These two examples require your trust in an institution to secure your savings/capital...you have to trust them not to fuck it all up.
With bitcoin, every coin is accounted for in a perfect open ledger and as long as you hold the private keys you don't have to trust anyone else to know that your savings are secure. Trustless.

I know you don't want to hear about it but we are talking about fungibility and privacy in this regard. 
You can buy an alt like XMR, that uses ring signatures to obfuscate the source and destination of the funds....essentially all the coins are untraceable and private. 
Then move your funds back to XBT if you desire...although you may get a mix of other coins from other various "undesireable" sources in the process. 
We don't consider the USD to have this problem even though something like 90 percent of USD bills have traces of cocaine on them.
  
So why do we apply a fungibility test to bitcoin and not USD bills?

You don't have "tap to pay"? We've had that in Canada for small purchases for at least a year or two. 
For purchases you just tap your card on top of the terminal and (based on what value the vendor is willing to accept as a possible chargeback, usually $20-50) the payment is made in around 1 second.

The html for the bitaddress generator has been checked by several people on bitcointalk for malicious code, and you can also take a look at the html before running it if you like, it is open to any text editor. 
Then you boot an offline pc with a usb linux boot stick...load up the html webpage (still offline) and generate/print the paperwallet. 
Or use Armory and you can generate paper wallets natively but you still should be concerned about using the pc online. Armory on a clean permanently offline pc is a good solution for paper wallets.

It depends on the number of transactions in the block. 
If there are a lot of no-fee transactions in the block the block will be closer to 25btc. 
If there are a lot of people being generous with their fee's it could potentially be 59btc for the block. 
I think Slush's pool had a 37btc block a month ago. 
In the future we will see miner's only processing blocks quickly if they have sufficient rewards on top of the block reward. 
Something like 10-15btc per block based on the processing required, or it simply won't get processed for hours/days/weeks until someone gets around to it.

I'm surprised this doesn't alarm people in general more than it does. 
It is basically the bank interfering in your legal economic relations with another entity.
Here in Canada that would be actionable in court. 
When you have one party telling you that they are tying your use of their products or services to you NOT using another companies goods or services, that interfere's with your rights and the market system. 
What is next? Will they deny your pay per view movie payment because the movie content is "against their principles"? I think we would all find that behaviour unfair and outrageous. 
So why are we allowing them to push us around when it comes to bitcoin? We are performing legal commerce. 
I'm surprised in such a litigious place as the USA that no one has sued for this. I would seriously think about suing if this happened to me here in Canada.

It's the same shitty system that disallows us to evaluate teachers based on their performance and to dismiss them based on poor performance. 
Malcolm Gladwell wrote an interesting article on this very topic. 
It is a fascinating read at why the teachers and their excessively protective union are basically ruining education in the US (and likely just as badly in the rest of the developed world).  
We would do well to take his suggestion of firing the bottom 10% of all teachers every year and allowing their positions to be filled by new teachers competing for those jobs with real interviews and placements rather than the current tenure system that rewards the old regime of teachers.

Exactly, this is simple algorithmic trading....someone used to manipulating the stock market is applying what they know to the bitcoin world.  
You can recognize the trends...they stop micro trading and the value goes up X amount, then the algo's get back to work dragging it down again with hundreds of lowball and low depth trades. 
They are gently bumping down the price with micro trades and buying in larger blocks when it is lowest.

I don't understand all the uproar about us here in Canada.... 
Taxation only applies when you cash out and make money...the taxation occurs when it goes back into your bank account. If you lose money on bad trades, you get a tax deduction for investment losses. 
Every modern country is doing or going to do the same thing...Canada was just one of the first to make an official statement. 
Does anyone really think that their government will let them "invest" a $1000, then a year later cash out $10,000 and not pay taxes on the difference? 
So, either don't cash out...or figure out a way to do so that is difficult/impossible to calculate the tax benefit.

Most of these small life savings type "investors" are really just "weak hands" that shit their pants when stuff happens like it did today. 
They panic sell and lose a bunch of money...drop out and never return to Bitcoin. (Hopefully)
There will be other bubbles, and they will be enormous and they will spectacularly collapse as well. But in the general scheme of things if you are smart and well informed it is not a big deal. Buy and sell contrarian to these investors and you will do fine. 
One thing that helps me greatly is to "zoom out" once in a while and look at the 6 month or 1 year chart. It puts these little bumps into perspective....then you realize the so called "volatility" is nothing but a bit of noise on the way up.  The big bubbles are the only thing to react to.

Actually I did something I think is just as clever....I put a shit load of money in prior to April. I made 10x my money and didn't know what to do about it. 
Now I follow rpietila's SSS and cash out 10% every time it doubles...as of a week ago I have none of my original investment still in bitcoin. I'm playing with made money only. 
So, to recap...I have a shit load of coins left, and no risk whether or not it goes to $10k or $0.01...but I do still firmly believe that it will go another &gt;50X next year. 
Do I need to "put everything I have into bitcoin"? No, I don't invest that way. I have my golden ratio and that's all I need. If it goes another 50x I will be so fucking rich to be honest it won't matter if it is another $10m or $100m...I'm not that greedy.

Well, since I made that statement I received my KNC Saturn and it has been hashing for 5.5 days. So far it is producing 0.64 bitcoin per day at this difficulty.  ($120 or so per day at the current rate.)
I need to run another 30 days or so at this rate, which isn't going to happen. 
I believe we will have one or two more big jumps in diff before Hashfast (delayed recently) and any others have a product out to market. I am seeing many of the orders getting cancelled over at KNC forums, so it is obvious that miners are not willing to operate at a loss. I believe that the orders for new devices are going to fall to zero if they haven't already, and many existing orders will be cancelled. I may still see break even yet after perhaps 50 days. It really depends on difficulty at this point. 
In any case I'm making bitcoins with the device, to me that is easier than getting money into the exchange and buying coins....all in all I'm happy with KNC and how it is going with mining.

Sales taxes are generally applied in the local jurisdiction where the goods and services "were delivered". (This is an example of how we do it in Canada.)
For example, if you do a local pickup of something (or receive services) the taxes are paid in that area. 
For internet sales if the goods/services are delivered by a "common carrier" like UPS/FEDEX etc. they are applied at the delivery location. 
If the delivery location is out of your country you don't have to collect taxes as the local customs office will collect those taxes in that area when it is delivered.

You missed a big opportunity to discuss the "intrinsic value" of gold actually. It has very few practical uses compared to say Silver. 
Gold is used very little in industry...silver is used in literally hundreds/thousands of manufacturing processes and medical processes. So...why does gold have such a higher intrinsic value? Only historical use as a monetary system and it's relative rarity gives gold any intrinsic value whatsoever. 
Gold literally isn't that useful....too soft for most uses, the only useful property it has is that it doesn't oxidise.
Bitcoins are a public ledger of contracts/transactions that spans the globe....highly useful and of extreme integrity. It has a high intrinsic value to everyone in the world if it is globally adopted.

Why does he/she have to make sure that people who live in countries where it is illegal don't buy it? 
Especially when they come to his/her country and buy it.   
Here's a simple example, in my country some recreational drugs are illegal.

The biggest advantage as I see it is the lack of management fee's on BTC-TC. You gain 5% right away. 
With the micro shares, the shares are the same just divided by 100, and the dividends are the same divided by 100 minus a 5% fee. 
With PT shares you get it all the same but no 5% management fee's....it's up to you if you feel you are getting value for that 5%. (Certainly the amount of work someone puts into running a fund is worth something.)
BTC-TC also allows you to do a share transfer out of the passthrough back to ASICMiner if you want direct shares or if there was some issue with the fund. This is a nice added security in case the unthinkable happens.
burnside seems to be a standup guy who is trying to protect the shareholders. 
Disclosure: I own a few shares, that's all...don't know anyone or have any inside info to do with the fund.

I think the Clyaton Act is ideal for this type of action. 
Note: "sales on the condition that (A) the buyer or lessee not deal with the competitors of the seller or lessor ("exclusive dealings") or (B) the buyer also purchase another different product ("tying") but only when these acts substantially lessen competition "
A condition of their sales of financial services is that you not use a competing financial service. "See (A)"

It is a self balancing mechanism buying vs (mining @ difficulty).
If it becomes unprofitable to mine, lot's of people shut off their rigs and the new money goes from buying new equipment and into buying coins on the exchanges.
The demand pushes the price up, and with everyone turning off their mining rigs the difficulty drops/plateau's to a level where mining is break even / profitable again.
This because the price of a bitcoin has doubled and the difficulty has dropped/stopped increasing due to a lack of mining. 
We are at a cross roads right now in that theoretically there are no technological next steps to be made. ASIC's are the best we have given the current tech.

It depends how you buy and or if you sell your btc. 
localbitcoins.com has no fee's to buy, you work out a deal with someone and that's the cost, you can sell them the same way or use an exchange and pay as little as 0.2%. (If you need/want to get them back into fiat.)
Paypal is 3% on either end, Western Union is 15%. 
Paypal can be 0% to send funds as a "gift", but you can only do that so many times and for low amounts before they lock you out.
Plus, both have a lot of web/forms to fill out, perhaps time wasted standing in line...and you are giving someone else control of your money and the right to transmit said money without scrutiny.
Your Paypal account can be locked or money taken at any time, Money transmitters can refuse to service you or confiscate your funds. These aren't additional fee's but they are an abdication of your rights, which to most has some value.

Well, I think in the days of GPU mining there was a bit more geekery to be had. 
You were always tweaking drivers and airflow and trying to build your rig up. And the reward was less consistent and more luck based / solo mining. 
It WAS a hobby then. Now it is really boring....people are trying to do the same mods to their ASIC stuff but in reality there is little you can do unless you have a problem with bad cores and a low rate.  (Read the KNC forums for that stuff.) 
Changing fans, bigger heat sinks and airflow in the case with the big miners is just masturbation to pass the time and try to make yourself feel better...these devices are super boring.

"So, I've switched to a bitcoin sales model only, using BitPay and Coinbase and I'm continuing the free shipping."
So I guess that worked out really well for them. /s
In all honesty you you probably take a small hit initially in your sales due to the fact that Paypal is well recognized but if people want your product enough they will figure out that Bitpay works perfectly and is no additional hassle. 
I was an online manufacturer/retailer for the past 5 years exclusively with Paypal (recently sold my business) and had a great experience with them...but I would never use them again now that there are Bitcoin options available.

I don't think they can do much more with the 28nm ASIC....other than sell them for a fraction of today's price and add many more of them per mining device. 
So, when the upcoming glut hits, the price will drop and the power will go up dramatically. 
Next gen may be what 10x more powerful than today's for the same cost?
So, 2-5TH per device for $3-6k comparing to KNC?
That means for 5TH they would have to have 40 of their chips inside somehow....and it would be pulling around 8.5kw to do that.

Use localbitcoins for both ends of the transaction and pay no fee's whatsoever...if you can't find someone who will sell you btc at current value that's not my problem. Work out a deal with someone and make a relationship face to face. Also there are Satoshi square events popping up in many major cities on a weekly basis, this is a great way to get btc at current value.

I was watching it at Bitminter for a bit today and it was giving 1% stale hashs then losing 600gh for a bit. 
I didn't see that proportionally it was the same at BTCGuild but it appears so based on the charts.
It was back inline this morning with the total @ 18-19 Th.
My best guess is the connection from ASICMiner to the pools were spotty.
Edit: I noticed some trends at both BTCGuild and Biminter.

Minepeon works great with the ASIC's....maybe try again?
I'm running my little usb erupter on it and it is solid.
Minepeon just plugs into your lan at home and you access it via a built in webserver. Find out the local IP of your miner then use a browser to get to it and enter...login:minepeon pass:peon 
Once there you can enter the pool you are using, or multiple pools with automatic switchover etc. 
You don't need a hub just plug the Jalapeno right into the Pi usb port.

Hmmm, sorry for not giving the best advice then. 
I had read others using minepeon with success and since I'm using an ASIC I thought it would be easy. 
Were you using the beta 0.2.0? or the June release?
I just loaded up beta 0.2.2 and it has some really nice new features including cgminer 3.3.1. If you haven't tried it, give it a shot.

MT Gox is likely never going to implement Litecoin. They have been teasing us since what April? It was supposed to be done with their new trading engine. Now IIRC they have backtracked on their statement regarding Litecoin.

The time frame is the next decade, the USD will continue to drop in value as it has over the last ~60 years. 
(The USD has lost ~95% of it's purchasing power since the end of the second world war.)
Consequently the BTC to USD ratio will go up and up and up...even with no other influences. 
Pressures to add to that...the out of control debt level @ ~$17T, the recent suspension of the debt ceiling, Bernanke printing $85B per month "quantitative easing". The stock market is way overvalued for no apparent reason, job losses, housing market. 
More and more people globally are becoming uncomfortable with holding the USD in any way.

Well, since paperwallets are not live there is no place to send change address transactions to...when you spend from a paperwallet you have to use them all at once. Hence why it is called sweeping.
You are literally "sweeping" all the coins from the paperwallet to the live wallet at once. 
Yes, for a live wallet you can use blockchain app or Mycelium app...there are many apps out there to do this by scanning the QR codes on your paperwallet with your device camera or manually typing the public/private keys in. 
Read more and get comfortable before doing anything though...I'm worried since you are asking basic questions about complex topics...one mistake could mean the loss of your coins. 
These coins are far safer in your paperwallet right now than pretty much anywhere else. 
Possession of the paperwallet is the key to your ownership right now, a live wallet in terms of an app or an exchange account has a higher possibility for your coins to be stolen.

I just don't like the 1/100 share concept with ASICM, I prefer the full shares with ASICMINER-PT. I've made a killing on them this week.

It's funny and counter-intuitive but when I had what I felt was a "small" smount of coins (in terms of dollar value) I was not spending. 
Not that it grew faster than I ever thought it would...I spent more than I normally would have and bought a trip for two to Cancun for a week this winter to celebrate...entirely paid for by bitcoin profits. 
It's as if now that I'm more "relaxed" about it I don't mind spending some if I had to describe the psychology.

When I went to take out money to deposit into CAVirtex I got the third degree from the teller for taking out a couple thousand at a time. 
Me: "I'd like to withdraw $3000."
Her: "Ok, let's take a look here...hmm yes we can do that....what exactly is this for?" &lt;Hands on keyboard waiting to type in my response.&gt;
Me: "Ummm, private business."
Her: "What like buying a car or something?"
Me: "I don't care to discuss this."
Her: "....ok then I'll be right back." &lt;goes and gets a manager to release the funds, comes back with money&gt;
You know it wasn't the delay or checking if I had the funds in my account....it was the goddamned questions that bugged me the most. 
Afterwards I was thinking to myself lots of snappy comebacks. 
"How about it's none of your fucking business? Give me my money bitch."
But I knew it wasn't her, so there is no point in bitching her out...it was the bank and their fucking computer program they were running looking for some kind of cover-their-ass bullshit in case the government came asking questions about my withdrawals.

The problem is that there is no longer any true "journalism" any more in the world. 
Coindesk is as guilty of this as CNN, FOX and the rest of them. 
No independent verification of anything, they read the postings just like you and I and then they rewrite them, summarize them and throw a thin veil of credibility over it because they look like a legit website. 
My estimation is that Coindesk is run by some average joe(s) in a basement just like you or I and simply doesn't have the time do do proper journalism research. 
It is basically the National Enquirer of bitcoin "news".
@_date: 2013-04-10 23:20:09
This is someone applying what they know about algorithmic trading to the Bitcoin world. 
What they need to do is put throttles in place so that a single IP can only put in so many orders in a certain time period...and set a throttle based on how big the orders are. 
Perhaps only one fractional order per 5 minutes...anything larger than 1.0 BTC is open season. 
I'm sitting watching it happening live....you can see shitloads of bit penny trades for undervalued amounts going through driving the price down. I don't know why these aren't weighted properly...they shouldn't have such a strong affect on the price.

It looks like a total cock up in any case. 
I designed my fair share of boards, maybe 35 different ones over the past 5 years in Eagle and Ultiboard. (I used to own a niche manufacturer of parts for race cars.)
It looks like several layers were not sent to the pcb fab house. 
I can get boards in my hand from China in less than 5 days...I've made my share of mistakes in the past. Usually you send them a zip containing the readme.txt which gives a layer stackup and other info about the production...and the 5+ layer files in gerber format that you need done.
It looks like they have some stuff on the wrong layer (chip pads on top silkscreen layer)...it looks like they missed several layers entirely, many of the minimum 5-7 layers on a double sided board are not there.  No vias at all which is basically impossible in any complex design. Everyone minimizes their use of vias but none(?). 
Basically I see a tray of unidentifiable chips...they could be anything from Digikey at all in that package size....who says they are even hashing chips? And about $50 worth of faulty boards.

Posted in another thread: (by me)
I'm surprised this doesn't alarm people in general more than it does.
It is basically the bank interfering in your legal economic relations with another entity.
Here in Canada that would be actionable in court. 
When you have one party telling you that they are tying your use of their products or services to you NOT using another companies goods or services, that interfere's with your rights and the market system.
What is next? Will they deny your pay per view movie payment because the movie content is "against their principles"? I think we would all find that behaviour unfair and outrageous.
So why are we allowing them to push us around when it comes to bitcoin? We are performing legal commerce.
I'm surprised in such a litigious place as the USA that no one has sued for this. 
I would seriously think about suing if this happened to me here in Canada.

Certainly any coin or jemellery shop can, even here in North America...I buy often and sell it rarely/occasionally. If you knew how fast their wallet comes out to buy gold for spot (or spot plus a bit if it is a govt issued coin) you would see it is still a powerful currency. 
I don't think I've ever dealt with someone who doesn't know what the spot of gold or silver is or doesn't know how to search for it in 10 seconds to make a deal. 
Go to places like Barcelona, Istanbul, Rome, Venice, Monaco....these are all people who know the value of gold and silver. It is only in myopic North American cities you find people who are skeptical of gold or silver being used as currency. 
Who would favor bits of paper that are essentially IOU's instead of gold or silver? It's ridiculous.
@_date: 2013-04-11 10:57:09
Why is the displayed current price the "last bid" value? This seems to be the problem.
Shouldn't it be an average of the price paid for the last 100 BTC traded or a weighted average? Olympic average, FIFO average...anything else than what they are doing now.
The price would then move a lot more in sync with what the value really represents.
Maybe the admin for Bitcoinity and other websites that display the current price can look into some different formula.
@_date: 2013-08-14 11:30:11
I'm the same. 
I hate hearing people talk about roi or break even dates....it's all spec right now. 
Their mining rigs sell in usd, not btc so at todays price for btc you only need to recover 36 coins to make your money back. Everything after that is profit. At 150m difficulty (3x todays number) that only takes 37 days.

The pads for the chips don't even look to be on a copper layer. 
It looks like they produced them on the silkscreen layer instead of the top copper layer.
If we look at the dark copper layer for what looks like some power or ground distribution traces they are covered with green copper mask....this is normal looking to me. 
The chips however have no exposed copper where their pads would go.
This is why the chips couldn't be mounted....they can't solder to silkscreen.

Day trading although we don't approve of it in general can also stabilize prices. 
(Not just day traders but savvy traders as well.)
When prices jump up fast day traders sell which lowers the price, when it drops they take opportunities to buy thereby raising the price. 
They can act as a buffer as we see today.

0.6% of $145 x 0.004 = $0.00348 per transaction in this example. 
I guess if they make 1000 trades it costs them about $3.50 in fee's at MtGox....MtGox isn't getting rich from this. 
Actually if it lags the server out for an hour it blocks them from doing much bigger trades where they would make much much more in fee's.

I love my preceious metals...but neither paper or gold will work when both the rebels and the military are searching everyone they come across. 
I remember watching a video about a guy who's family had some gold in Iraq before the war and they had to bury it in the garden and hope that no one stumbled across it before they could get back to retrieve it. 
They couldn't take it because border guards would take everything of value you had with you in order to facilitate you getting across to safety. 
He still hasn't been able to get back to get his families gold.

The tradeoff is liquidity...and time. It is great to own direct shares if you are holding long term. But it can take a day to sell your directs in Bitcointalk, and then a week to get them transferred to the new owner.

Inflation calculation is another scam in itself...they constantly claim &lt;2% and yet how much have the everyday things you spend money on gone up? 
Fuel, food, utilities? None of these are even included on the govt calculation of official inflation...wtf. In what world is this reasonable? 
Just holding cash is a loss year to year of about 5%+ I would guesstimate when you consider the real cost of living change and inflation. And everything calculated in USD undergoes the same loss...that includes retirement savings plans.  
Holding some other asset like real estate/property, Bitcoin or physical gold/silver are much more protected from inflation losses alone...these are exactly the best places for savings.  Don't have all your egg's in one basket but at this point I would have very little savings/investments that are held in USD.

Fyi, there are several countries that do just fine without taxation. 
Even if we take Canada as an example it is fucking ridiculous that we pay taxes with the amount of natural resources we sell each year to foreign governments and corporations. 
We have something like 3 trillion barrels of oil, nearly all the existing fresh water, tree's, diamonds....and only 35 million people. The world "value" of an average Canadian is something like $30 million....and they still want a big piece of my income every year.
 
Go fuck yourself government, if you can't turn a profit big enough to support us with what we have you don't have any right to run the country.
 
There are literally shit hole sandbox countries in the middle east with only oil income to support a larger population and they do it without taxation.

You wouldn't believe the lengths they went to in order to justify their actions. Manually processed transaction without my card, hand signed typed letter explaining the charge...

Miners keep the network moving....like it or not someone has to pay the electric bill or our fuck-the-man-anarchy-machine doesn't keep running. 
It is ok right now because the block size is 25 bitcoin, in 2015 it will be halved and the equipment necessary to mine a block will be astronomically more powerful and higher in price. 
We get about 0.5 btc right now avg for mining a block on top of the 25btc reward. 
Life is ok right now with low fee's and mining equipment that is $5-10k and basically doesn't even break even....that won't last forever. 
I don't have a good solution, but lowering the fee's doesn't help the situation.
Mark my words, you will start to see miners rejecting/avoiding blocks with no fee's or super low fee's if they aren't already. 
Then when the payments don't get moved around the network what happens?

For personal acct's you are fine to do what you want with bitcoin....you may get wires revfuse to the exchanges but they will not close down personal accts because you are dealing with bitcoin on a personal level.  
For business accounts they are not willing to accept the risk.

They have already stated they have about 1 Peta hash of hardware to roll out as the other miners release their hardware....I think they can keep up with the 2-3 other mining hardware companies that up until now haven't been able to produce anything other than bad websites. 
Avalon is the only one on the verge of delivering batch 3 hardware and then chips. Once the chips go out we will see if the reference design scales up well for all the Klondike investors. 
KNC seems to be staying on top of things but we haven't seen a working prototype and Sept is coming fast. 
BFL is catching up on Jalapeno's but they are not even a fly spec on Friedcat's windshield at this point...a few TH and that's all. 
I think that ASICMiner will hold out as the dominant force in mining hardware for some time. They have the advantage of time and a direct access to chip manufacturing in China that no one else has.

I would guess that if bitcoin gets to $100k there will be a lot more haters in the world. 
Think about how everyone who heard about them and didn't buy them in 2009 feels right now....regret, painful regret that they aren't a millionaire already. And that is probably just a few thousand people.
Imagine that multiplied by the "perceived loss" and enormous envy that the general public will feel because they laughed at it now and missed the boat.
And don't get me wrong....there is still time to get on the boat. 
We are still at a very very low rate of exposure.

I think you are right....people had no idea this guy was 18. 
They just saw a service and used it.
I still stand by the fact that with him being 18, even if he was a genius Bill Gates type he doesn't have the knowledge, ethics, education...even the basic legal requirements figured out to know that he is liable for those losses. He obviously lacked the forethought to protect his clients and seek advice in terms of security, insurance, and how to run a business. 
This type of immaturity especially in terms of formal business education is how failures end up with the operator throwing his hands in the air and stating "my bad, I lost all your money".  
Now he is afraid to report this to the police? I'm not surprised, he is either directly involved on the misappropriation of the funds, or at the bare minimum he is liable for the loss of hundreds of other peoples money....the police and the court are not going to be happy with him. "Breech of Trust" comes to mind in cases like this.
The police could conduct a trace of the IP addresses to at least clear him or confirm his involvement.

Not at that hashrate for that cost...no. 
You have to realize there are 3TH units coming around that time that sell for $12k. And they sold 1200 in the first batch. 
We (miners) have an opportunity to make some money from now until Cointerra/Hashfast and then KNC deliver in the spring but it will drop dramatically between now and then. Also, do not discount ASICMiner who has said they are coming with a very efficient device, probably in May next year. We are going to see huge difficulty increases that are unpredictable to us right now. 
Interstingly KNC has said this will likely be the last "consumer level" products they will produce due to the power requirements being too high now for a household supply. 
I believe the days for hobby level mining at home are going to dwindle out by next summer just like USB miners are worthless to run right now. 
@_date: 2013-11-06 02:08:54
Funny I sent my son his first bitcoin tonight using Blockchain between Electrum and two Android devices....as fast as I hit the button it was in his wallet. 
(Ok, I admit the confirmations will take a bit of time.)
The point is that we can probably go to 1 confirmation transactions among people you trust...they have no way to recall the payment and as long as the miners are doing their thing and you paid the tiny fee of 0.0005 it will go through in a short period of time.

What I meant by that statement was that we are running out of technological leaps. 
With nothing on the horizon beyond ASIC's, we are going to be at a deadlock in terms of difficulty and hashrate in no time. 
I would say by January or so it will be unprofitable to mine with anything we have now....and the difficulty will plateau out for a while until either people start to shut down their hardware or some new hardware is discovered. 
All the 130nm and even the 65nm ASIC's are basically money losers right now....only 28nm has some hope of break even at this point. There is little below 28nm available to our industry....and adding more and more 28nm stuff will be unprofitable soon.
Who is going to buy new hardware when nothing is profitable? No one....or almost no one.  The difficulty will stall for the indefinite future after that point until something new comes along.

TAT.asiminer-PT is also on BCTC....do you think those are somehow different than the shares on Havelock?
Do you mean that they are more valuable than any other 1/100 PT? 
I have no idea if that is the case because I don't own too many of the fractional shares.

For them to do this represents an illegal tying arrangement. 
You can't tell people that in order to do business with them they have to refrain from doing business with a third party. 
"sales on the condition that (A) the buyer or lessee not deal with the competitors of the seller or lessor ("exclusive dealings") or (B) the buyer also purchase another different product ("tying") but only when these acts substantially lessen competition (Act Section 3, codified at 15 U.S.C. § 14);"

I am very bullish on bitcoin for the long term, but I really don't think we are going to see it completely replace any major world currency completely. (With the exception of perhaps some small troubled nations.)
What I do see occurring is the complete destruction of money transmitters and payment processors...like Paypal, Western Union etc. 
With bitcoin having low/no fee's and high security these money transmitters/payment processors will go the way of the travel industry and the real estate industry...the power will go back into the hands of the people needing these services and out of the hands of the middlemen.
If bitcoin ONLY destroyed these areas of the financial services economy one coin will be worth an astronomical amount compared to today.

Something like Mycelium or the Blackchain app will do fine for this purpose.

The proper way to do this is to get a police report and then he can go to his insurance company (yah right) to make a claim and try to recover the loss for his clients.

Do they think we will run scared to our google machines to look up their insightful thoughts on the matter like we've never heard it before?

Yes, it was only the first mint 2011 coins...they are worth much more. 
I have no idea if someone will be willing to pay that much when bitcoin gets that high...I would say by that point you/they won't care any more. 
I would tell them to only sell those coins when they absolutely have a good reason....college money or something equally important.

Why is the displayed current price the "last bid" value? This seems to be the problem.
Shouldn't it be an average of the price paid for the last 100 BTC traded or a weighted average? Olympic average, FIFO average...anything else than what they are doing now.
The price would then move a lot more in sync with what the value really represents.
Maybe the admin for Bitcoinity and other websites that display the current price can look into some different formula.

I "operate my finances" in a diverse manner....and I don't have my life savings in Bitcoin, nor much of any debt at all. Debt = slavery
You are vastly underestimating the market. It is self balancing and correcting, and those functions work just fine without babysitting. 
When a whale sell's off 20k bitcoins like we just witnessed today there are many many opportunists just waiting with their fiat to buy in when the price drops using tradebots etc. (Myself among them.) 
Volatility for merchants is easily managed using simple hedging strategies and companies like Bitpay (if they don't wish to hold BTC long term)....it is a non-issue.

You can if you want to! 
Hopefully the US will change it's stance on bitcoin and more options will come available to you guys.

I bet many of these get fucked up with people/small assembly companies trying to DIY mining rigs and copies of Avalon hardware base don the released designs. 
I also think that many people who bought them will be reselling them once they figure out it is not easy to get them built into a working rig...

Why would we want to mine Litecoins?....That just supports their transactions and widens their network. 
The only people mining Litecoins right now are guys/gals with GPU farms left over from when they mined bitcoin.

If HSBC says they don't support bitcoin and want to close your account because you even mentioned the word....you can remind them that they are the world's biggest money launderers...not you. 
Their $1.9b fine, (and just the fine mind you) for money laundering....it almost twice the size of the bitcoin economy.

I got mine from Sparkfun ages ago...but you pay a premium for redistribution. 
I have to believe they are in good supply by now...
It looks like Newark, ADAFruit, and others have them for about $40.

I pay large for that service...Amex Platimum costs me $500 per year, second card for wife is $250. 
Even if the card is free, you are paying with high interest rates, and we are fully aware as consumers that the merchant is paying up to 3% for accepting the cards as well. 
If we pay via bitcoin, give us a discount of 3%...or split it with us.

Can't that job be done remotely from anywhere you have an internet connection for a vpn?

That's fine...just relax and don't make any rash decisions regarding selling. 
Most bad trades are made on panic, and before I've had my morning coffee.
There is no way to lose money in this long term, time eventually fixes all wounds gained during the learning process. 
My earlier advice regarding stepping back and looking at the big picture still applies. Go to the 1 day once in a while and smile when you see that up-slope. 
@_date: 2013-11-03 13:19:54
There is nothing to learn...no additional fun or enjoyment to be had with these devices at all. 
You plug them in, point them to a pool and never look at them again. 
Unless you consider "fun" to be pissing $100 into the wind and having $40 splash back in your face.

I enjoyed reading sgtspike's comments and now I have to agree with you...it is more positive language than I recalled after watching it the first time.

I don't like the 1/100 micro shares. 
I know it doesn't matter, but to me it seems small unless you own a few thousand micro shares. 
Edited: I guess they do have the same liquidity as BTC-TC
Also, TAT is a good guy from what I've read.

I know, I was just being obtuse....I upvoted you anyway to balance out whoever downvoted your comment. 
A month is fairly short notice for people to travel that far. 
Maybe the intention wasn't for a 'Canada' meeting there(?)...although I'm sure they would be glad you made the trek. 
For local enthusiasts a month is plenty of notice.

That's awesome, it gives the concept of "pending coffee" a global reach.

IPO was what 0.1, you sold at 0.13(?)....we are at 4.5. 
So, you lost out on 30x returns, ouch. 
I'm not even going to poke fun at that, I'm so sorry dude. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 01:44:02
It's amazingly offensive but unfortunately totally true. 
Most teachers are offended to read this and can't possibly understand why it's true because they are living inside their own delusion of grandeur.
@_date: 2013-04-20 12:50:43
I completely agree...don't wait for some "perception of success" because that is a moving target...the "success" we are looking for has already occurred! 
@_date: 2013-09-16 23:37:01
You say that like it is a GOOD thing!?! 
Imagine the transaction was reversed....you accepted $80k, sent the goods on their way, the international customer receives their item and then fucks you in the ass with a reversal. 
$80k isn't enough to lodge an international lawsuit and get anything back, so now what?
Charge backs are the devil when it comes to the online economy, if you think that the wire being reverse able is a positive feature you are deluded.

You are a bitcoin business...banks have never played well with businesses dealing bitcoins. 
For personal use everyone here is just fine.

No one knows but if they got a takedown notice they probably wouldn't be allowed to wind down. It would be that the website is taken over by the SEC or FBI. 
I suspect what everyone else has also....Ethan's lawyer read him the riot act and told him he will go to federal prison if he doesn't wind this up.

We don't really want "protection"...if you are looking for protection you would be best to go find another investment vehicle.

Haha, you don't know me but I'm not a neckbeard at all....and yes I know personally or have met at least 100 teachers in my life. 
When ever I meet someone weird or just a little off it is always my first guess that they are a teacher....almost every time I'm correct when the question rolls around to "So, what do you do for a living?". 
Are you honestly going to say to me that the teachers lounge isn't the weirdest group of individuals you have ever come across in one place? 
@_date: 2013-07-20 13:21:42
I think this is the best advice. 
Take your time and buy in on the dips. Buy a few at a time when the price drops. 
Don't be manipulated into buying more than you are comfortable with. 
Don't day trade no matter how tempting it is...you have no advantage right now, as a newbie you will lose some of your funds. Hold long term and don't worry about losing a bit in the short term. (Look at the 6 month chart more than the 15 minute charts.)
If you want to invest in a mining stock read read read the prospectus and make sure you are comfortable with the statements.

You are surprised by bears on parade? 
This is what they do. Combine them with the forces of regular joe assholes that missed the boat and now want to watch it burn. Add to that pile the number of bank regulators that want to see it stopped and this is what you get.

This is why I'm absolutely sure the diff increase is going to fall on its face really soon. 
New miners have a very low tolerance for mining at a loss. 
By saying that I mean that it is a rare person that throws $100 to the wind just for the "fun" of plugging something into a RasPi and watching it do literally nothing for the next month and earning them a diminishing return. 
There is no fun in this type of mining....it is plug and play and it doesn't beep or have a little marching band go around when you make a Satoshi...no fun really at all. It is cold calculated economics....you buy a $100 device, rarely look at it for its lifespan and it gives you $40 back. 
Multiply that by 250 and you have all these newer larger ASIC based devices that sit in the basement and also make half of what you paid for them....the economy of scale isn't any better at $5k than it is at $100.

There is an open source design...but you'll need to write your own firmware for the micro.
@_date: 2013-06-24 00:29:41
There are no other miners in this class...and don't talk about K1 unless you an have on in your hand by next week. 
@_date: 2013-05-20 23:23:42
You could hit a home run with one of the others....I noticed that the other ones aren't doing very much. 
I would stick with ASICMiner, and keep your ear to the ground in case of any newcomers that are interesting. 
Most of the other funds look like something you could start yourself with no hardware and a bit of capital....no particular advantage like with ASICMiner designing, mining and selling their own hardware.
