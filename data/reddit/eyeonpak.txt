guys chill.... let me try to explain. Charging interest is  a sin according to Qur'an. Islamic banking is practically the same thing they just changed name of "interest" to "profit". Interest is forbidden bcz Jews in old days (according to Qur'an) use to charge unfair interest rates on loans, practically enslaving the borrowers. My point was that most muslims don't trust banks &amp; don't like Jews, which means they r the best market for BitCoin, it is interest free, no banks, No repressive Gov't can seize their account. Its a win win just wait till the Arab world gets into this ppl will forget China.
