Good for the guy, he’s at half of his mark and thanks for sharing it with us! Motivational!
@_date: 2018-09-25 23:01:31
Agree with you
Why? To motivate others to hold or maybe just to share something that you cannot explain to parents/wife :)

No. I am not arguing, I am noting that street criminals will help with user adoption of crypto since it’s so much more efficient of a tool for the bail money - difficult to cease, hard to trace.

Poor Craig. Gets schooled daily nowadays haha if only there was a way for him not to pretend to be one of the smartest people in the history of humanity :)
@_date: 2018-08-18 13:40:06
Interesting angle: banks accts are easy for the government to freeze so you will not be able to post your own bail. Crypto if held outside of an exchange is very difficult to freeze/cease.  So basically what the government is saying that all street criminals should get a ledger with 5-10BTC to post own bail with :)))

Fake quote. You want to hate him - find something real to hate him for. Like the all the charitable contributions he and his family has been doing for the last 200 years

Great attitude.
A. Contribute to the economy, get wealthy/rich
B. Hate rich people.
You choose B.  Classy!

But feel free to ignore facts and spew what your bias is telling you.
@_date: 2019-01-14 02:59:32
Israel’s borders are opened. You can book a flight and enter and leave the country. :))
Anyways, we have different opinions on the subject. I showed you your bias and you have your genocidal opinion about borders of Israel not being their anymore = a country without borders is not a country.  And the region where it’s located is full of friendly neighbors.  I would not wish that on backward countries like Iran... why are you wishing it on Israel? What about the civilians? Why do you hate white baby boomers? You have issues.
Also Israel is the most multicultural country in the middle east. So your hate is baseless. Look in the mirror, be kinder. Peace!

Quarry bitcoin hahahaha what an idiot.  Cost of security companies transporting money, vaults, banks... he does not count that.
Also - please do not insult Israel because of one idiot economic advisor... governments around the world are full of these narrow-minded people riding high on their horses fighting against the digital revolution because it will dethrone them.  So this attitude is government-specific, not Israel-specific  
@_date: 2019-01-14 17:35:47

@_date: 2019-01-13 23:31:17
In comparison to which government? That’s a nonsense statement.  Israel is clumsy, but it is a democracy with the rule of law governing the country and courts.  Just that alone puts it in top 20%. If you add the location - middle east - it walks alone... so back to your statement - Natanyahu government is shitty, but it will not be there forever including this idiot “the” economic advisor.  All dinosaurs are always cleaned up by evolution.
