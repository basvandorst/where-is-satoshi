Yeah it looks good. I expect US news media to continue with their FUD reports but luckily those media outlets are irrelevant in the global market. They have some heavy bias. I cannot tell the number of times I have read. "The bubble has popped!" and then it rebounds.

Why would you link to this website? Isn't this website owned by that guy who is a vocal supporter of insider trading, the same guy that made all of his money by selling explosives on the internet and then going to prison? Then dumped his American citizenship but wants to move back? Going by the DSM 5 he could be classified with ASPD (sociopath, psychopath).

Wow, I'm sorry I even read your comment. "I think this tech sucks and will ultimately be worthless". *goes and invests in said, crap technology* Maybe go read Ghandi's definition of happiness, yeesh.

You're no different than the people wanting crypto to succeed. You want it to fail so you can fool better about not investing in it. Those who are speculating hope it succeeds so that they feel better about investing. Comments of it will go up or down are completely irrelevant without an explanation. It will likely go up simply because the transaction fees will be reduced to zero in the coming months for bitcoin. Typically where bitcoin leads, the other alt coins  follow in value. The technology will evolve. You might want to look into alternative forms of self therapy than posting unsubstantiated banter.

I guess the question is will younger people be less susceptible to sensationalism. Or will the Gell Mann amnesia effect always work against us?

I don't understand the bcash obsession. If bcash were to go more mainstream rather than act as faux bitcoin. Wouldn't the bcash ledger ultimately end up being thousands upon thousands of terabytes in size over a short period of time? Wouldn't that damage mining operations and make the system vulnerable to attacks if there are only 1 or 2 hubs handling all bch transactions? Wouldn't this also make it easier to tamper with the code?

No one knows what is going to happen. All the bubble people always come out when their is fall. And then they go silent when there is a rise. No one knows the future. Every time someone says "China" everyone loses their shit and bubble people come out. Then it bounces and then it falls and then bounces back and then falls. You'd think at some point people would remember what was happening a month or two months or three months ago. But that is not how people are.

You were doing good with this post until you went with the big 0 comment at the end. Extraordinarily ignorant.

Not a smart thing to do. Crypto currency has not even come close to being adopted into the mainstream. If bitcoin fails, crypto will never shake the tulip mania comparison. It will be like the past 9 few years didn't even happen.

It is unwise to use the past as means of predicting the future. Yes the re is a popular old meme that says otherwise but for every example to prove a narrative there is one to counter it. Point is, the here and the now define tomorrow.

No one got into this to have centralized currency. If you like BCH you might as well just use regular government money because this whole experiment is worthless if you put banks in charge of crypto currency. We get it. You're hoping to get rich with bch. You're missing the point and you would be better off speculating elsewhere. All of the flaws that bitcoin has also exist in bch and are far worse. BCH is not leading with better tech, it is just an attempt to control the leading crypto.
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:33:17
Only old people watch tv. Younger people hopefully know by now that news outlets are just a form of control and manipulation. They are pushing the bch narrative as hard as they can.

The thing about people saying this, is they never have to worry about being wrong because "it hasn't burst yet". And when it crashes... They pat themselves on the back and say "see I told ya so". Such talk is meaningless. None of us know what tomorrow will bring.
@_date: 2017-12-02 13:21:22
Hard to say. Could shoot up as well. People will be getting access to their BCH. Will they sell and buy more bitcoin? It seems like a safe bet that BCH will take a tumble in Jan.

You would be surprised how many people think in the US. "I am smarter than the rest of the population and I'm going to be rich". Hell dude, even I know that isn't true. But for some reason my rational self takes a backseat and even I fall for this bullshit. I gotta fucken stop... rational me knows I'll never be rich. but irrational me is more entertaining to listen to. Just like John Nash's imaginary room mate. "you're a genius!" Our country is fucked. God money...

You don't want to mess with the IRS when it comes to this stuff. They know they aren't allowed to go after the big tax dodgers so they go after small people with crypto. I understand your interpretation of cc rewards but unless you have the capitol to buy a few senators and hire an accounting firm to declare you are in the right. Then don't fudge with this stuff. BTC is viewed as a security.

Hard to even justify playing a game now when there is a real visible opportunity cost involved and not merely theoretical.

My GPU pays out like $2.50 a day at the moment. (it is all relative... if alts were higher in value. more like  $7-10) In a way you could say this is a way to subsidize the cost of a GPU.

When the Chinese new year ends, bitcoin will rise. In Asian culture, there is superstitious belief that gambling during the New Year holiday is bad luck. And bitcoin is kind of like gambling. Also it is not uncommon to give gifts for the holiday hence selling off bitcoin. (and if any of you say blah blah China ban.... just shutup. bans do not stop anything in China. just makes them less convenient for some.)

This is just crypto weather. Relax man. Crypto swings like nothing else.
