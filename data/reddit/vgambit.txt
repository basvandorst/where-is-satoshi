@_date: 2014-01-31 21:15:54
Really? Can you elaborate on why?
My understanding is, you download the page for a client-side BIP38 encryption service, copy it to a USB drive, and use it on an offline PC with a bitcoin private key that was also generated offline and a secure passphrase. Then, copy the encrypted key back onto the USB drive, send it to whomever is printing the paper wallet, then store the drive somewhere secure as a backup. 
(btw, I plan on making a guide myself once I finally do everything, just to have an end-to-end solution for others that want to follow my path)

I'm looking for a native iOS wallet, and I'd go with this one if I was able to tell the wallet what denomination I want to enter, and type it in directly. Don't decide that bits are best for me. Give me options, and let me choose my own default. Whether that's USD, EUR, GBP, JPY, bits, millibits, microbits...
@_date: 2014-07-25 22:05:34
I was gonna say something to this effect. Using bit-card ensures that your private key never sees the internet, as it is generated offline in the machine that prints your card.
Also, I recently placed a second order with them, and will receive 3 identical copies of my bit-card. They won't be fireproof at all, but I think it's pretty damn unlikely that three different places will burn down simultaneously.

It would need a sit-down because the idea of a diamond engagement ring is so ingrained in our minds. It's not easy to change someone's mind about an idea they've held for their entire life.

@_date: 2014-06-02 16:33:04
They sure as hell require something. I think if you don't have 2fa set up, you have to input your password again to double check.
@_date: 2014-10-12 07:20:04
Order a set of identical [bit-cards]( It uses BIP 38 encryption to generate a private key based on a passphrase generated from a password you create. You create a passphrase locally, then send it to bit-card.de. They print a set of cards containing your encrypted private key (covered by a holographic, tamper-evident seal) and a link to view your bitcoin address. 
Distribute the cards to various different addresses/loved ones, then send the bitcoins you want to store to the address from the card. Whenever you want to retrieve your coins, use your original password to decrypt the private key and sweep the coins into a new wallet, then discard the cards. 
I have personally (successfully) done this twice.
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:29:58
You don't need to go to all this trouble. You already have an answer.
I just hope people don't follow the last dude who tried something like this, and "sweeten the pot" with extra bitcoins for you to just sweep into a secure wallet immediately.
This is a pointless exercise, even if we assume that you're telling the truth. If you want to figure out how long it takes to crack a password of length X, you take the amount of possible combinations Y and divide it by the amount of attempts per second Y, dividing as needed to boil that astronomical amount of seconds down to something like another user said: 3+ quadrillion years.
There is nothing to figure out here. The computing power it would take to crack this in a reasonable amount of time would be better spent on mining altcoins than cracking this password.
@_date: 2014-01-31 16:29:10
This is good progress, but I'll count it as seeing my bitcoins when I can plug in an address and have it calculate the balance, convert it to USD vs an exchange of my choosing, then work that into my account balances.

This is far from a "new scam." Avoiding a means of someone sticking on a fraudulent QR code is common sense.

Unlike with fiat, if you decide to take control of your bitcoins into your own hands, you can actually keep them reasonably safe, but that's a pain in the ass.

I believe encryption is a key part of "storage."
If my paper wallet is stolen and encrypted, I have all the time in the world to use a backup to move the money to a new secure wallet, since the amount of time it would take to brute-force the password is ridiculous. 
If my paper wallet is stolen and unencrypted, the thief has until the moment it is stolen to the moment I find out to simply yank my money. Basically, I'll have nothing looking out for me in the worst-case scenario.

You're arguing limitations that will eventually no longer be an issue. People that use bitcoin today are already using it. Because they find value in it, other people will also keep using it.
Bitcoin is a network. What happens to your "I can't spend it in most places" argument when it is no longer the case? This is why we have evangelists, and why people frequently spend bitcoin more in support of the network than to actually buy something they need.
We gotta grow the network for it to get to where we want it to be.

If a bank ran away with my money, or otherwise became insolvent, the government would guarantee that im get back 100% of the money I had in it up to $100,000.

@_date: 2014-01-07 07:19:30
It's kind of like that analogy, except I'm spending bitcoin, and won't know the exchange rate until I get to the register, at which point I can exchange the money instantly, then send it instantly.
Except in this case, the institution that was supposed to send the cashier my money instantly screwed up somehow, so my cash didn't go through until hours after I left the store with no liquor.
Had I known the exchange rate ahead of time, I wouldn't have waited until the last second to do the exchange. Nevermind the fact that the exchange, the last two times I did the same thing, took a total of 1 minute to fully process.

My problem isn't with bitcoin as much as it is with the state of affairs when it comes to actually spending it. The companies that I invariably have to use as facilitators for my transactions are dropping the ball right now, and it is costing me money. I had no reason to believe that Coinbase wouldn't send my money to Bitpay immediately. As it is, in the time that it took for the transaction to be confirmed, I could've driven to Atlanta and handed Bitpay the cash myself. 
I don't think I'm asking for much. I'm asking for prompt support; that is, if you email me, and I respond within 5 minutes, it shouldn't be taking you a full day to get back to me. I'm also asking for companies to simply get it right the first time. Receiving only the amount that I sent while the invoice was active, as opposed to that amount plus the amount that I emailed Gyft about, tells me that somewhere along the line, my very clear words were outright ignored, and a script was followed instead.
@_date: 2014-04-18 16:48:47
Don't try to "convert" bitcoin skeptics. If they aren't interested, tell them to steer clear. If they are, then try to answer their questions as best as you can. If you can't, then you should do the research yourself, because their concerns are probably valid. 
Echoing Bitcoin is still in beta right now, and is not yet ready for primetime. The vast majority of the infrastructure that enables bitcoin to deliver its full value proposition simply hasn't been built yet. For example, it will turn the remittance market on its head one day, but first, each country needs to have one (or more) institutions where people can exchange bitcoin for their local fiat. 
Even in the US, it's a pain in the ass to get a bitcoin. You can earn it if you can find someone willing to pay you, which is very difficult, in general. You can buy it from Coinbase if you provide all of your information and wait a week+. And then you can use that bitcoin to buy all of the same stuff you can already buy just fine with a credit/debit card. It's a tough sell at the moment. 
Tell people that it's more like TCP/IP than the Internet. If they don't know what TCP/IP is, then tell them that they probably use it dozens of times per day, and leave it up to them to research it.

Again, hindsight 20/20. The purpose of doing the transaction in bitcoin is twofold; boost the crypto economy by buying and using it, while getting a discount in the process. I also disagree with Paypal philosophically, as they have a nasty habit of screwing over the little guy (see: [Skullgirls]( [donation drives]( ebay buyer scams, crypto buyer scams).

This comment will probably get buried, but pathology labs use this for microtome sectioning.
You go to the doctor. They cut off a chunk of whatever, and send it to the lab for testing. The lab gets it. They stick it in a machine. That machine cuts it up into tiny slices, and places each slice onto a slide.
That slide was printed ahead of time. It has your name, case number, and so on... As well as a QR code containing other important info. Another worker scans that code later on in the diagnosing process so a digital record is kept of it, without the errors introduced when people have to write it down on paper or type it manually. And it has a pretty significant effect on turnaround time and throughput, as well, which is important in these situations.
Basically, don't write off technologies so quickly, and don't presume to be totally aware of every single application of them. QR codes are *huge* in the medical industry.

The loop is supposed to be: initiate Gyft transaction to view the cost in BTC, buy BTC from Coinbase, send the BTC from Coinbase to Gyft via Bitpay, receive gift card code. 
Otherwise, I have to guess what the cost of the gift card will be, and subject myself to even more of Bitcoin's market rate volatility than I already am when I keep that loop as short as I can.
Hindsight 20/20. Assuming this issue is made right, in the future, I'll spend and replenish rather than trying to do it all at the same time. That way, it won't matter (much) how long it takes Coinbase to get me my crypto. What sucks about that route is that I'll be without coin while I wait for it to arrive.

We're all early adopters here. You have a lot of valid concerns with bitcoin as it is. 
The reason why you should buy bitcoins is because you're willing to bet money that most, if not all of the concerns will be addressed by as yet unknown technological innovations. 
Do I believe that in the future, people will be distributing copies of their BIP38-encrypted cold wallets amongst their friends and family instead of using a bank? No. I believe that one day, there will be banks much like the ones we have now, except they'll be open 24/7/365, and we won't be afraid to store money there because it will be insured. The difference is, those banks won't be loaning out $100 for every $10 they actually have, and we as consumers will have the ability to independently verify that anytime. And that's only one of many possibilities.
The reason why you should buy bitcoins is not because of what it can do for you today, but because of how hopeful you are of what it can do for you tomorrow. The greater the potential you yourself can envision for this technology, the greater its value, and the dumber you are for not spending every cent (that you are willing to flush down the toilet) on buying as much as you can.
Edit: In case I wasn't clear, I'm not trying to convince you to get into this. Just wait. You might not believe this looking at the volatility in the crypto-exchange market, but every day, bitcoin becomes more valuable than it was the day before.

Until we're at a point where a person does not need to know the ins and outs in order to use it without fear of taking a huge loss from a couple misclicks, I think we have a moral obligation to discourage at least the use of, if not the interest in, bitcoin amongst laymen.

I don't think bitcoins are a bad idea.

What is stopping me from doing the following if I'm a bad actor?
1. Create a new, fake Facebook account*
1. Grab a credit card with a high available balance
1. Use that credit card to buy $20 worth of bitcoin over and over until I hit the card's limit
1. Report the card as stolen/file a chargeback
1. Pocket hundreds/thousands of dollars of bitcoin that you will never see again
1. Keep all of the money I had spent on them via credit, leaving Tinkercoin holding the short end of the stick
Edit*: I haven't looked closely at the site yet. I'm assuming that there is some validation between the name of the Facebook account and the name on the credit card. But if I'm John Smith, and my Facebook account is John Smith, I can simply create another Facebook account called John Smith and use that one, so where is the validation?
I mean... This site seems susceptible to that exact attack, if I'm not mistaken. It's certainly not anonymous, but I don't even need to go to the trouble of stealing someone else's credit card to take as many free bitcoins as I could otherwise charge to my own.
I suppose my question is, how many times is the above situation gonna happen before you guys shut down? Because I think you greatly underestimate the propensity people have to run scams on others, especially when the practical equivalent of free money is on the table. There is a reason why you keep hearing about all of these other people/companies who ran similar services referring to *every single one* of these services in the **past** tense.

This is incorrect. Your Google account was, in fact, linked to Coinbase.
Coinbase uses Authy for 2FA. Authy is linked to your phone via your phone number. If you have Google Voice, you are probably using that number for Authy. 
This worked against you in this case because Coinbase has a failsafe for a non-functioning/lost Authy app; 2FA via SMS. That fact is not immediately apparent when setting up your account; you don't see the option to request a 2FA code via SMS unless you click a link that, under normal circumstances, you would never have a reason to click (Code not working?).
I'll say this much; I am now extremely afraid of getting my Coinbase account compromised. If an intruder gains access, it isn't just your hot bitcoins you lose. It's the full contents of whatever bank account you have linked to it. I'm gonna switch to low-balance accounts on Coinbase ASAP.

One thing to keep in mind, even with all of your concerns about how customers will react to, for example, having to return a fridge that doesn't fit only to find that the 1 BTC that they paid earlier, converted to USD, then back to BTC right now, is now worth .8 BTC...
Is that *we* are your customers in those cases. And if we're telling you "it's okay! Just give it a shot. We understand the risks and will bear them in exchange for the ability to be a part of this thing," you (and your boss) should listen.
If Lowes announced that they would start accepting bitcoin at all of their locations, a lot of people on this subreddit would start shopping there instead of with their competitors, even if not necessarily with bitcoin.

At the very least, sit her down and have a discussion about financial responsibility, and how buying a ring or going into debt for one demonstrates a huge lack of it.

That is just an amazing bit of engineering. I'm probably gonna read the BIP38 draft before I read the Bitcoin white paper.

How does one "push" a transaction?

Once we're out of beta, people can make mistakes with bitcoin without losing money. We will have bitcoin banks the same way we have fiat banks. 
They'll probably take the form of payments over X painful-to-lose amount generally using multisig transactions.

What is wrong with you?
In the best case scenario, if you bet, and bet, and bet... you'll simply lose 1% of your money. The website says as much.

This dude created his account to post this, and after 15 hours, has not posted any proof that he actually has the money.
Obvious troll.

The thing is, a lot of the benefits bitcoin has right now are arguable and fairly useless in most people's minds.
I am 100% certain that nobody can do anything with my money unless I give it to them. I can only say that about my bitcoins; I cannot say that about my checking account or various credit cards.
I am 100% certain that any money I receive is genuine. I can only say that about bitcoin. I can only say that about fiat if I happen to be skilled enough at spotting fake bills. 
If I am paid, I know nobody can take the money back while keeping the service or goods rendered. Again, that is built into bitcoin from day one, but is not at all true for credit cards.
If I hold a controversial political belief, or do something that some company disagrees with, nobody can restrict access to my money. True with bitcoin. Amazon payments? Visa? MasterCard? Paypal? All of those guys stopped processing donations to wikileaks the second the federal government arched an eyebrow.
None of what I just said means a damn thing to most people. They don't realize how badly they want that freedom, how much they take it for granted until it's gone. Bitcoin allows me to make sure I still actually have that freedom. That is why I say wait until it has more obvious benefits for the average folks. There's little need to jump in on bitcoin unless you can already come up with a good reason why. For example, between fees and chargebacks, low-margin merchants benefit tremendously from the security and low fees of bitcoin.

Then don't get mad when you have to choose between ponying up a 3-month salary ring and ending the relationship. :p

The end result I'm shooting for is a physical wallet (from bit-card) that contains both a public key and a (BIP38-encrypted) private key, but I was also looking for a more end-to-end guide. Some of the stuff in the sidebar is outdated, and I don't wanna [accidentally lose a ton of money]( because I missed some crucial aspect of what I was doing.

Paid by who? And why? Who benefits from trying to change 160k minds in this sub? If you're trying to reach a bunch of bitcoin users, why ever come here? We have 160k subscribers with 1k online right now.
Bitcointalk has 500k members with 3k online. 
I'm not even saying that paid shills aren't a thing. I'm saying that if they were, they wouldn't be here, because it makes no sense whatsoever. We don't even need to be convinced of xyz in bitcoin. People that would benefit from convincing us can just do shit, and there's nothing we can do about it except control who we vote on (with our measly 160k votes) and who we spend money with (again, between 160k people).

Largely so people can send and receive money (somewhat) directly. 
You find out you can buy and sell things on eBay. During the process of buying, you find that you have to use this thing called Paypal to pay. To use it, you go to the website, create an account, then type in your credit card info like you would with any store, and finish your purchase. Super-straightforward.
If you want to sell stuff, you still use Paypal. Obviously, you can't receive payments through your debit card, so you link your checking account to your Paypal account. Yes, it takes a couple of days to get the verification deposits to finish the link, but once you're done, you're done. It's all easy. You don't need to have any part of the technology explained to you because it's all abstracted behind plain English explanations of what it is you wanna do. Buy, sell, send, receive money.
I don't even like Paypal. I hate their practice of randomly freezing crowdfunding project accounts. But because it's already so widespread and has a super-low barrier to entry, especially for people making purchases, it's pretty much the best tool for the job right now. Bitcoin cannot yet compete.

Aside from the touch of ad hominem, this is a great response. However, I feel like the people I'm talking about, the ones that we're currently trying the hardest to get into this technology, are the ones that are near us, not the unbanked.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:51:22
You essentially dismissed my entire post as "short-sighted drivel."
Also, I'm not sure you realize this, but unless you're saying the average person is unbanked, your statement doesn't disagree with mine.
@_date: 2015-03-27 21:16:08
Use BIP38 encryption and store the passphrase offsite. Then even if it's found, and the people who find it know exactly what it is, it doesn't matter, unless they also know where you keep your passphrase.
@_date: 2015-03-12 21:52:54
Again, I feel like this isn't really a problem for the vast majority people.
@_date: 2015-02-04 17:19:37
This is kind of hilarious. I welcome the incoming downvotes, as this isn't feeding into the usual "everything is great with bitcoin!" mentality of this sub, but if you ask the average person about bitcoin, *if* they're aware of it, they think that it died with Mt.Gox.

The net gain right now is 35%. If only there was a way to quickly run through this loop. I think any of the steps outside of taking bitcoins out of an American exchange and moving them to a Chinese exchange would immediately kill most, if not all of the profits out of the sheer amount of time it would take vs. the size of the window of opportunity. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:48:54
I imagine even a slow bot would be pretty lucrative over time, especially if the script was of a "set it and forget it" sort. 
However, the more I look into it, the more I realize that this is, ultimately, [probably not going to work out for me]( as an individual as I had initially thought it might. Buying bitcoins takes too long, withdrawing yuan takes too long, and buying dollars with yuan, using Money Gram/ Western Union takes too long or costs too much. There is a significant discrepancy between the value of btc to China and to the US right now, but the value will normalize on its own (with the help of the exchanges, like you said) before any one person can really take full advantage of it.
