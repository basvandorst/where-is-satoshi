Well Im not sure what you mean by "live release".  Its alive right now from what I see.  In the media it was called a beta release so when could we expect them to report its out of beta?  I also believe the official code has a btc limit built in.  People are free to remove it themselves but when would that officially be removed?

Ah the challenge of downloading a 32 meg file on the old dial up.  Thankfully someone thought of splitting stuff up and recombining at a more convenient time.

Certainly will.  And I noticed you added to your first post with more detail.  Thanks.

Maybe official was a bad choice of words but there is this 
thats obviously linked to everywhere.  From that github I read "amount_msat is deliberately limited for this version of the specification; larger amounts are not necessary, nor wise, during the bootstrap phase of the network.".  To me "out of beta" would mean that limit being removed.  Theres still adoption to deal with after that with wallets and payment methods but the lighting network would be "out of beta".  Or am I horribly confused here?

One day I hope to be as tired and jaded as you are.

First thing I heard of this is when the API started reporting my account was frozen.  To be fair though.  It only took a couple of hours after uploading my DNA before I was able to use my account again.  So that's now Tom, Dick and Harry that have a copy of a drivers licence and a bad selfie from me.  Im suuuure they will take good care of it.  Its fine thoug.  Im from the EU so apparently the GDPR will protect me.

I hadnt considered the quality of the current readers.  That would explain why I couldnt find anything much of interest when I googled it.

People just write F**K OFF on the walls round here.  I should move.
