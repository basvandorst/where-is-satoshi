I'm not sure how they are anymore but when I bought some I used coin base a few years ago. Before you first transaction they required only banking information. It them took about a week to verify your banking information by them making 2 less than $1 transactions with your account and you had to say how much they were. A little bit of a pain but then you don't have to send more ID.

And they will charge the fees needed to stay without artificially limiting the number of transactions. A market exists due to natural factors like the extra costs of including more transaction. By forcing a 'fee market' its simply creating an inelastic supply on an industry that could produce more. There is already a fee market and it decides what the fees are now.

Bitcoin cash has a larger block size which allows more and cheaper transactions, therefore it has more utility. One of the main factors in the value of currency is its utility and this threatens bitcoin core.

Well what the sign is complaining about is how the Fed continually prints money (and does other things) to keep inflation at around 1 to 2% a year, essentially devaluing money. Bitcoin has a 'hard' limit of 21 million bitcoin so once they are all mined there won't be consistent inflation and this is one of the reasons some people like bitcoin. Personally this isn't a good thing about bitcoin to me as inflation has a purpose of encouraging people to take their money and invest it in something that has returns so they don't lose value to inflation. The problem is inflation isn't a problem for the poor as they often don't have money to save and therefore don't lose value to inflation, or to the rich, as they have people who help them invest an the inflation actually does encourage them to keep more of their money out creating infrastructure. The problem is the middle class who do have some money to save but often have little to no guidance in how to invest it properly and much of their money may just be sitting in the bank getting devalued.

Interesting, only problem I have is that, at least if I understand your design right, the qr code is on the screen of the customers phone trying to order and there is no real way to scan it. Maybe if someone made some other bitcoin wallet app that could handle transactions in a secondary app. Eg I have this wallet on my phone which works like any other wallet, but it also allows apps like the one you propose to request payment and have you verify within the drink or whatever else app. The drink app would them just send its address to the wallet app that would handle the payment.

These are some good ideas. If the big bar payment systems could get registered with one app and incorporate it into their systems for easy use, disclosure then that app just has a bunch of bar choices and you go to the one you're at it could work really well. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 15:52:19
Well I think the easiest main problem is identifying who payed and how much easily. The Block chain just represents with numbers so the app gives a way to connect the adrress with the drink order for easy verification by the restaurant.

Well you can't build your own ASIC miner, ASIC stands for application specific integrated circuit.  An example of an ASIC is a GPU or CPU where the integrated circuit has the intended operation to be just that.  An ASIC miner has a chip in it designed specifically to mine, it is not a re-purposed GPU or CPU, it has been designed to mine Bitcoins as efficiently as possible and do nothing else.  You could potentially build a  computer with that would be much better than other computers for mining, having tonnes of GPUs, but it would not be an ASIC miner and would not be as efficient as one.

You could but then you would have to have these installed all over the bars, a far more elegant solution is to use what we already have. We could have an app that bars sign up for that handles it for them. This app takes care of the orders, and as was suggested, it may have a small wallet associated with your account or you can allow the app to make purchases with a wallet app you already have installed(this would require a password and the wallet app would handle the transaction and private key as before). I just don't see how asking bars to install tablets or whatever all over makes them want to adopt bitcoin.

A short summary of how the average person is going to learn about bitcoin. 
1. Go to porn website. 
2. Run into pay wall that suggests bitcoin, intrigued but too horney 
3. Masturbate 
4. In the post fap "wtf am I watching" remembers bitcoin pay wall but is too tired now to research bitcoin. 
5. Fall asleep, wake up the next morning with no memory of a bitcoin paywall
6. Tries to Masturbate again, hits bitcoin pay wall, this time he is angry because nobody messes with his porn
7. Protests bitcoin because no one messes with his porn. 
... Well shit, that story didn't go where I thought it was gonna go when a started writing it. In reality it will probably be a huge advertisement for bitcoin and wives everywhere will be wondering why their technologically inept husband's are so interested in this crypto currency

First off it depends on how you set up your bitcoin app, you could have it let you make payments unprotected if you really believe your phone won't get stolen or that you could sweep them back to a safe account fast enough. You could even have a similar setting where transactions under a certain amount don't have to be authorized. Second you have the same step with the current payment system, you tap your card and have to either sign or type your pin. With a nfc bitcoin system you tap your phone and enter a password, pin, or possibly a fingerprint though some of the phone scanners security have been questioned. Either way it's the same number of steps with the same security of the transaction, now with bitcoin instead of credit card and the benefits or disadvantages of the basic security associated with each.

The whole gox thing was written on the walls. I am relatively new to bitcoin when I joined in December and with my little research before getting started it was pretty clear to me to stay away from gox. I continually heard that it took forever to get fiat out if you were selling and the price was so much higher than all the other exchanges something had to be wrong. Secondly you don't have to trust an exchange. With what little I have, the second it came through the exchange I took it out and stored it myself, it wasn't hard.

If someone takes the time to send them a check, I bet that person really wants the porn and is gonna pay for it (if someone actually pays in check which I kinda doubt). Credit cards and bitcoin purchases online are much more likely to be either rash decisions or someone who wants to pay once and cancel immediately. If you're one of the people who is gonna cancel immediately you'd prefer to use bitcoin which like others said they can't keep changing for unless you cancel. So in the end all that would happen is some credit card purchases get moved to bitcoin then they either make the same they would have or more likely lose money on those cause the person doesn't have to remember to cancel

Still I think not is the way to go. I know with my phone it recognizes nfc without me having to pull up an app. I could imagine a system that when you tap your phone, it recognizes it as a bitcoin payment and auto opens your default bitcoin app. It then sends the payment amount and address to the phone to be auto filled. The only thing you'd have to do is click OK or possibly enter your password and your done

There are a lot of instant gueenteed bitcoin to dollar merchant tools. While this gets around the point of keeping the bitcoin this is one way to do it. Also currently bitcoin isn't so widely used that only a small portion of the purchases will be in bitcoin and you can likely take that hit

Your argument is the same one that people use when they don't, that the current president isn't their president because they didn't vote. In a normal election, only those that vote count which is mathematically identical to having non voting hash power distributed evenly. Having non voting hash power vote core is like having everyone who doesn't vote in an election vote for the person who currently holds the seat which is a highly unfair way to decide their vote. 
@_date: 2016-03-16 17:14:24
Because it's likely that many mining operations will be un profitable when the halving occurs and switch off. Because it takes time for the difficulty to change (likely a few weeks) then time between blocks could easily grow causing blocks and mempools to fill. No one really knows how much hash power will be affected by this so the size of the impact is all speculation. 
@_date: 2014-01-03 09:13:50
Quick, let's hire an app guy
@_date: 2016-03-17 21:16:54
If they really want classic it is in their favor to vote core as they will not only be voting with their hash power but a proportional amount of the undecided, this should push both sides to vote in slush's pool, and possibly even attract more hash power to his pool for the same reason. If this was implemented across the network (not that it's feasible) then it would be identical to counting only people who actively vote which is what happens in a normal election 
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:50:15
No its definitely not un reasonable for a data center and I wasn't saying that, that was kinda the point.  Plenty people have home internet that easily streams 2 netflix shows which is why i made the comparison.  Currently 90-180 would be unreasonable for a household but perfectly reasonable for a datacenter, though in the future I could see 90-180 Mbps being reasonable for a household as well.
@_date: 2016-03-13 17:20:05
So approximately the bandwidth of 2 Netflix shows running at the same time, but you have to do it constantly. Though to be fair that assumes you take the full 10 minutes to transfer a block. In order to get the blocks transferred faster you would probably need 10-20 times the bandwidth. 
@_date: 2016-03-17 07:34:31
I'm not sure of completely agree. If it is 50% of the miners that turn to be unprofitable (which when this first was discussed many people thought was a high estimate) than doubling the block size, with blocks taking twice as long to create, should leave us with twice the room we currently have in the blocks. And assuming fees remain relatively constant, make the spam attack twice as expensive as before. Unless your making another argument I didn't quite catch. 
@_date: 2016-03-13 19:51:06
Very true, but just addressing it as the network currently stands.
@_date: 2016-03-14 17:15:53
But you can have both thinblocks and weak blocks, they don't interfere with one another and get both benefits.

Yea I mean I understand but when you have pre established names like Google just trying to get their name on a different platform why have a squatter who adds nothing take the name and sell it to them when the company who developed the platform or registering service could make the money to make it cheaper for average users or to put more into developing their platform. With some sort of combo model like I proposed, the name wouldn't be broadcast so if you came up with a new name that's clever no one would fight you for it and you would get it for free, but established businesses could pay the creator instead of the squatter and new names that become popular quickly through other means and then lots of people nearly simultaneously try to create them could cost money as well. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 20:51:04
True, it's definitely not perfect, it's just what was on the top of my head.  There might not be a better way to implement it but I was curious if there is some way to figure out which names are popular so it doesn't need to be preset ahead of time.
@_date: 2016-03-04 17:21:32
But it doesn't replace anything they've been doing. Things like segwit aren't just thrown out, they can still be adopted, and many probably will but they're not ready to be deployed yet. 
@_date: 2016-03-29 17:53:12
It seems like in that case you have to define the price for every name, or set of names. But if something becomes popular all of a sudden it will be first cone first serve or the creator could forget to add some smaller, but still large, business names to the expensive list. Wouldn't it be nice to let the popularity of a name auto determine the price? Maybe something like when a name is asked for, the first person who asked has dibs but the price is determined by the number of people who ask for it in the next 24hrs. The first doesn't want to pay that price, it's offered to the second and so on

Supposedly 80% of the developers do not work for blockstream. If this is true then why would you be worried about losing them. Either the majority works for blockstream and are heavily influenced by them which is a problem we shouldn't sweep under the rug and keep chugging along like nothings wrong, or many developers aren't influenced by block stream and that's not a valid argument against the fork

The thing in, it isn't even the same. One of the main reasons governments began to control money was so that money could be consistent over a large area in order to ease trade and avoid lots of changing of currencies. Sure it is a move back to a "private" currency (I wouldn't even call it private since no one controls it ) but it is a move towards a wider reaching currency that eases transaction costs. This article is naive on even the things it should know about, let alone how poorly it understands the "technological trappings " that also help advance it way past private currencies of the past.
