How will you be able to close positions without order book? You can't just close for example $10M longs at $600 because noone buys that. Who will cover this without doing fractional reserves. Positions should stay open, for calculations of affected funds you should find some other way.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:30:10
Regarding the accounting, what does this mean in the following case: I have 1btc and have opened 1btc short position, will you cancel the position at last price today or wtf? You shouldn't in this case as it is not really margin.
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:12:28
No? This guys probably pulled tens of millions of profit and have stakes in several BTC companies.
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:16:59
BFX probably has several $100M of customer assets, so stolen amount should be somewhere in 10-30% of all assets. In case of any deal and any continuation with withdrawals or with trading we demand all funds back whatever fair way they will figure out. Otherwise it is bankruptcy, where overall assets (BTC, USD, other crypto, profits...) are much higher than the stolen one.

Can you please post requirements for the verification?
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:52:29
From the address I deposited months ago the coins were sent to a different address around 10 hours ago. Does this mean this coins were stolen?

Don't rush, you won't see nothing nice in your account.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:03:27
You need to cancel all orders, there is no point for users to 24/7 monitor when you will give 15min for closing orders.

It should be straight forward that one is full USD, because the buyer of the short is actually holding BTC on the other side.
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:11:38
Someone having BTC and being margin short same amount after settlement means he is full in BTC or USD?
@_date: 2015-12-22 16:30:06
It's an old joke in different context.

Anyone can estimates what percentage of transactions are those of miners and pools distributing many small amounts (also for shitcoins with direct exchange to BTC)? Can that percantage be double digits? Any idea?
@_date: 2015-12-06 00:38:44
It does matter because of estimating the BTC real use transactions not transactions because of BTC economy on its own.

Nice, but what percentage of people did actually know what BTC is? Looks like 100%, but really, what was the % as you obviosly included just people that know about it.

I ended reading after "In early 2013, it was triggered by people in Cyprus buying bitcoins to move money out of the country as banks started tacking on a wealth tax". Sorry, but this bubble never happened because these people were buying BTC.

Yea, build infrastructure so that if BTC fails we will take over other currency and we are safe again.

I have this kind of feeling for every investor in BTC companies and if you are denying that they want crypto companie not BTC company you are blind. But yea, at the moment, we could say crypto = BTC. But investors have from te begining in their minth that if BTC fails, companie just moves to the next best possible winning currency.
Probably all of invested companies have answer to the question "What if BTC fails" that is not "We close down".

Not to dispute main idea, but I am sure the average fee is likely around 0.25% and not near 0.5% as you stated. There are many whales and other users and auto systems with lowest fee, maybe even special even lower agreements.

When investors step in, not minute before.
Group of traders drives us up and down whenewer they want, considering down is easier, needs less cash and is more profitable.
Looks like majority would just like to profit out of Bitcoin without puting much cash on risk, thats why news have no effect, cause no serious money is coming in (maybe there is some otc hoarding, but real demand would also be visible on exhanges).
@_date: 2015-03-02 10:32:45
His two reasons for being bearish are:
- first one is arrogant (if he can't almost decade ago noone can);
- the second one is kind of stupid, he never heard probably that media can be simply manipulated to fit anything and surely they won't report mostly positive when price is going down (ask Cramer).

Probably not. He earns so much on that $25 coffee that it doesn't matter if he loses 20% on volatility.
At first it doesn't look logical, but it is true that from business standpoint it is safer for him to accept that minimum if he is not using 3rd party processor.
