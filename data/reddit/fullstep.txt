Are air drops happening often? Last one I heard of was for Stellar.
@_date: 2018-01-04 18:03:05
I guess i've considered the term "air drop" to reference a type of distribution which requires you actively claim the coins by proving ownership of a BTC address through the signing of a message. Whereas the term "fork" means the coin simply uses the BTC block history for its distribution and doesn't require any active claim process.
Are these coins forks or air drops?

I have a Gemini account. When I go to the BTC deposit page, it displays a non-segwit address. I don't see any option to change that to a segwit address. I'm assuming that you can only withdraw to a segwit address, but I haven't tried.

It can't be tracked any better than cash transactions. The tax authorities don't know what you spend cash on, and they don't know what you spend bitcoin on. But it is very unlikely you can buy anything of a large value without it drawing attention, and questions about where the money came from. And if the government catches wind that you're suddenly living in luxury, and your latest tax returns don't show income to justify it, then they may audit you. And if they find out you didn't report income to avoid paying taxes, they may charge you with a federal crime and throw you in prison. So just pay your taxes.

I didn't read the story, but it is almost impossible to mistype an address and have it pass the checksum verification such that you'd still be able to send the funds to it. This is a built in safety mechanism so that mistyped addresses can't be sent to. So if that is what OP is claiming, it is almost certainly fake.

Scaling in layers is the only realistic solution if bitcoin is going to be a global currency. BCH has no long term scaling solution. It's a fraud. It may seem fast and cheap now, but that's only because no one is using it. If their blocks were to fill up then they will have the same high fees and long confirmation times. Then what? Increase the block size again? How many block size increase can they do before no one can run a node and everyone must rely on a third party to tell them the state of the network? Is that the spirit of bitcoin and satoshi's white paper, relying on a third party?
Can BCH implement lighting? No. Because they shunned segwit, and segwit contains the transaction malleability fix that was necessary for lightning to exist. So again, BCH has no long term scaling solution. People are buying in to it because they are hoping that it is a second opportunity to get in on the ground floor of bitcoin. But they have been duped. And the people who duped them will eventually run away with everything. I feel sorry for BCHers. They are either blinded by their own greed, or they are in on the scam.

This study applies future block sizes against current connectivity speeds. We all know that internet connectivity speed will increase along with block size.

I really want to be positive about this conference, but I am struggling.
BIP101 seems to have the most community support, yet without Gavin (or at least Mike) presenting on it, I can't believe that this conference fairly represents the big block argument for scaling. Looking over the [presentation topics]( it looks to me more like a conference designed to promote the idea of small blocks and off-chain solutions to scaling (lightning network).
What can you tell me to restore my faith that this conference is not specifically designed for a small block "rough consensus" outcome?
@_date: 2015-12-05 14:52:12
The centralization effects of bigger blocks are highly debatable. With regard to node count, it is based on the assumption that the block size itself (not the size limit) will increase faster than storage and bandwidth, which can be mitigated by sensible scheduled limit increase.
Even, hypothetically, if somehow the block size did increase such that a portion of the nodes would be shut down, it is still debatable what portion of nodes would have to be shut down to cause a negative effect. For example, reducing 6000 nodes to 1000 nodes is probably problematic. But  6000 to 5500, not so much.
AND, we also don't know how the community may react due to a node centralization effect. They could step up and increase the number of nodes should some sort of concern about the full node count occur. I am not running a full node now, but I would if the network needed it. I am sure there are many more like me.
In other words, it's all speculative. And frankly, IMO, the node centralization issue is does not have enough credibility to hold back block size scaling.
I know there is also the concern about miner centralization. I am less informed on that issue, but what little I know seems to me like arguments that attempt to make mountains out of mole hills.
I am all for the lightning network and other solutions to scaling that may come in the future. But we need something now, and unfortunately the LN is not ready. And I don't think it is wise to hold back growth on the assumption that it will be ready soon and will work as expected.

I deleted my comment before I knew you responded because I didn't wanna get drawn in to a blocksize debate while I was on the elliptical at the gym typing on my cell phone. But since you responded and now that i'm home:
Yours is a fair response, and you deserve full credit for all the improvements you've help merge into bitcoin core. I am not trying to take any of that away.. but I feel it is deceptive... repeat: it is *deceptive*... to try to frame general improvements to bitcoin core as if their purpose was to help facilitate a larger block size as it relates to the blocksize debate, which does not include increasing block size specifically for segwit. Again, *it is deceptive* to frame it as such, when it is virtually guaranteed they would have been implemented as general improvements had there been no blocksize debate. I can't see any other way to interpret it. I can see it. I think that is what Gavin sees. And I am guessing the majority of the pro blocksize increase community sees it as well. You are not being truthful. Gavin is absolutely correct in his post above, despite however you try to dance around it with technicalities.
If I may pose a metaphor for this blocksize debate, it would be like this: You, Luke-jr, and the others who stand in opposition to a block size increase are like parents who want to keep their child in a plastic bubble to prevent him from ever being sick. You can justify it, because what good parent would ever want to let their kid get sick, right? But we all know that in reality, such an upbringing hinders the child's growth and development in an unhealthy way. It is essential that he be allowed out of the bubble, even if it means getting sick from time to time, because experiencing and overcoming sickness is what makes him stronger and healthier in the long run.
We cannot try to keep bitcoin in a plastic bubble, because we do not with sufficient certainty know all the problems bitcoin may face in the long run. We can only theorize what they may be. So, we have to let bitcoin out with the expectation that if it should experience problems along the way, that they can be resolved by the community, and bitcoin will come out of the experience stronger and more resistant to future problems.
Throwing out all these hypothetical, highly debatable situations of what *might* happen if we increase the blocksize has gone well beyond a healthy analysis, and well into an unhealthy analysis paralysis, as Gavin so aptly put it.

Yes I am aware that there is a presentation topic on BIP 101 block propagation, but that is a narrow sliver of the topic of big blocks in general, and hardly a full representation of it.
Whether or not Gavin and Mike were invited and declined is irrelevant. Without at least one of them attending, it becomes highly questionable whether the conference can produce it's stated objective, as there is a glaring hole the presentation topics. How can you say we will reach a consensus on scaling without a fair representation of one of the most popular solutions? You can't. Do you think you can just dismiss BIP101 because Gavin couldn't show up to the conference? Sorry, it doesn't work that way. Without him (or to a lesser degree, Mike), the conference is slanted and the outcome questionable.

I guess I would argue that waiting for a confirmation shouldn't really be a problem for 99.9 percent of transactions. For that small 0.01 percent, you can likely operate on zero confirmations because those transactions should be a pretty small amount where the amount of effort to double spend them is not worth it.
What is the context of your transaction? Was it a POS retail situation or something?
@_date: 2014-05-22 15:21:07

This is the ebb and flow that bitcoin has been going through since it has started. Ups and followed by downs. Right now we are in the downward trend following the price increase in early December.
This is a predictable trend. The last price increase was spurred by media coverage which brought about a lot of new adopters and speculators. But after some time, the story becomes stale and the media coverage decreases. As such, so does the price and the public's interest. Historically, after about 4 or 5 months of little media coverage, a random positive news event will catapult bitcoin back into the media again with a fresh new story to report and it will bring bitcoin to new highs.
I expect bitcoin to rebound within 3 or 4 months. During that time, we could get as low as $500 per coin.

I expect that the next difficulty change won't be exactly 2016 blocks after the halving. I'd be curious to know exactly how long it would be. Even if it happens at the same time as the halving, I suspect miners who know their profitability will go into the red, will begin to drop off the grid days or weeks before the halving occurs. I don't think it's going to be as sudden as you're suggesting. But in any case, it will be interesting to watch.

I don't agree. I confirmed the transaction existed in the bitcoin network. It was sent out and propogated to all the nodes. At that point, the transaction was sent properly. It's just a waiting game to get it verified.
That said, in this case it appears that blockchain.info's database may have been lagging behind the bitcoin network. Because when his transaction finally did confirm, it jumped up to 4 confirmations almost instantly. So my assumption is that it was confirmed at around the time OP made this thread, but wasn't showing as confirmed on blockchain because of their internal lag.

A better solution would be to simply not reuse addresses. You should be generating a new one for each incoming transaction. If you are using a service or application that doesn't allow you to make new addresses then you are doing something wrong.

If the hash rate plummets, so with the difficulty level. At which time miners will turn back on their ASICs because, while they are only getting half as many bitcoins per block, they can solve more blocks. Then the hash rate will rise again, and the asics will be turned off again. This difficulty-bouncing effect will repeat for a while until the hash rate settles. What happens when it settles? I don't know. But I suspect there will still be plenty of hashing power. The dynamic difficulty level will see that mining always remains profitable.

It is still an issue that should be addressed in bitcoin core. From a pure marketing standpoint it is a huge problem that I think is severely underestimated.
How many curious non-tech savvy people google "download bitcoin" and click the first link that comes up without knowing that alternatives exist? Then they get frustrated and quit due to the ridiculous download situation. Another adopter lost. Likely relaying their negative experience to their friends.
How many curious non-tech savvy people that manage to find the [bitcoin wallets page]( even understand the pros and cons of the various options? How many of them, out of confusion choose not to go any further? How many of them, out of confusion, choose to download bitcoin core with the assumption that it must be the defacto wallet, and therefore the best (which it is, if not for this download issue)? Another adopter lost. Likely relaying their negative experience to their friends.
IMO, it should be a high priority for the developers, if not the highest priority. Merchant adoption is nice and all, but general mainstream adoption is far more valuable, and there is just too high of an entry barrier for the common person. The core developers can not remain ignorant or turn a blind eye to this.

Do you think the federal investigators are just going to let them keep their bitcoins without any fuss? Of course the BFL guys have them. They either have the private keys stashed somewhere or they know someone who does. And they will be pressured to give them up. And if they refuse they will get longer and harsher sentences and will still be on the hook for paying back their customers anyways, probably through wage garnishment after they serve their jail time.

You're wrong. If people hold their bitcoins in a bank, the bank can "loan" out those bitcoins in the exact same way it does with cash.

Downloading and running bitcoin qt from behind a home firewall, which is pretty standard for a home network these days, is not a full node because it is not accepting and relaying transaction data. It has no ports exposed to the internet to connect to. It amounts to nothing more than a simple wallet.


How exactly is this happening? The QT wallet just communicates to it's peers, which is usually no more than 8 nodes on the bitcoin network with the default configuration. If you're going to suggest that attackers can port scan a computer to discover it is running bitcoin qt, they can not do that when it is running behind a home firewall. Further, I would expect "mainstream" users would not have their wallet running all the time anyways. They would likely only run it whenever then need to send or receive bitcoins.


I dont disagree, but practically speaking, how exactly does the layman even know that electrum exists? And if they do happen to find the [bitcoin wallets page]( what is the likelihood they will understand what they are reading and make the appropriate decision?

The current block size (1MB) is only capable of of holding about 7 transactions a second. If we want more transactions we need to increase the block size. Yes increasing it from 1MB to 2MB is easy,but that gets us from 7 to 14 transactions a second. A far cry from visa numbers at 40000. How big can we make the block size before it becomes unreasonable? So, when we are talking about competing with visa for number of transactions a second, I see the block size as the major limiting factor, not bandwidth.

1. Merchants who accept bitcoin in exchange for goods and services is what gives bitcoin value. Every day more and more merchants are accepting bitcoin. Right now, bitcoin is more like a paypal competitor than a real currency. It is used to easily, cheaply, and securely transfer wealth between two parties. This is a necessary step on the path to becoming something more akin to a real currency. Bitcoin may not be backed by any government (although that is a possibility in the future) but through exchanges it can still have value. Just like the euro does not have any value in the US, except through an exchange. Really, it comes down to the overall community, their trust and faith in bitcoin, and their willingness to trade wealth for bitcoin, that gives it value.
2. It's not impossible to mine. Obviously every 10 minutes someone mines a block. But I suspect you are referring to the issue with ASIC miners and how hard it is to obtain the latest ASIC hardware prior to it becoming obsolete, while those who are able to obtain it can control a large percentage of the mining power. Yes this is daunting for many enthusiasts who would like to mine. However there are a few things to consider: 1) Difficulty in mining doesn't make bitcoin any less secure or the protocol any less reliable. Bitcoin is still bitcoin regardless of the mining situation. Gold is very difficult to mine too, but did that make the US dollar less valuable when it was still backed by gold? 2) the mining situation is a temporary issue that will resolve itself within a couple years. ASIC mining hardware will cease to become obsolete so quickly when it catches up with the current limits of microchip manufacturing technology. Current ASIC hardware is about 30 nanometers. It can't get much below 20 nanometers before it will simply hit a wall and will not be able to be improved upon. When that happens, ASIC hardware will be as widely available and as cheap as current GPU hardware. And the days of a few ASIC miners controlling a large percentage the mining power will be a thing of the past.
3. Yes. I've 16k invested myself. I purchased 2 more coins last night when it went below $500. IMO, it's a great time to buy. I think it can and will hit $5000 before the end of the year, and that is a conservative estimate. Could be as much as 10k.

In essence, that is exactly right. The US gov makes payments to the fed to pay down the portion of the debt that the fed holds. The fed then takes a small percentage of that payment for its own internal operating expenses and the rest essentially gets given right back to the US treasury.
It doesn't make much sense from a high level, but I am guessing there are probably some finer details within the process that help to make sense of it. The fed does more than print money. They also control interest rates. So perhaps it works this way to help facilitate the total of the fed roles and responsibilities. I don't have a definitive answer for you but I am confident that what I stated in my previous paragraph is correct, from a high level viewpoint.

Just relax and wait. You're crying wolf over nothing and I think that is why people are reacting negatively to you. For me, I almost always get my first confirmation within 10 minutes. But yes, sometimes it can take longer. People have stated that they have waited up to an hour before. It is rare but it can happen. I think confirmations will becomes more consistent when the mining craze calms down in a few years and most of the income from blocks comes from transaction fees instead of mining rewards.

Money does not get destroyed when debts are paid. What you say would only be true if it was. Money is recirculated and reused.
This is how it works: when interest is paid to the fed on debt we owe, that interest gets deposited into the national treasury and then recirculated. That same money can then be used as interest payments again. And again. Or it can be given to a government employee as wage compensation, minus income tax, which can be used to pay interest.
Point is, money that is used to pay interest on the national debt is not destroyed. It is recirculated, retaxed, and reused. Theoretically, $1 could pay off the entire national debt if it was retaxed and recirculated enough times.

I think the point of a paper wallet it to store bitcoins mid-to-long term. Sweeping the bitcoins from a paper wallet into your bitcoin client is pretty quick and easy. So as far as convenience is concerned, it's just a matter of getting your paper wallet from wherever you stored it and importing the private key. It's not what I would consider terribly inconvenient to do so if and when you decide you want to spend them.

You don't seem to understand how fractional reserve banking works. Banks don't loan out more money than they have with fractional reserve banking. All it means is that they have to keep in reserve (in their vault) a percentage of their total holdings. They can loan out the rest. So with bitcoin, just as with cash, there is no reason they can not do this.
If a bank has 1000 bitcoins on hand, and fractional reserve banking laws say it must hold 10%, then they can loan out 900 bitcoins. That's all fractional reserve banking is.
Edit: Where fractional reserve banking becomes hairy, and where it is criticized, is when the process is reproduced with the same moey from bank to bank to bank. So bank A holds 1000 bitcoins/cash and lends Ted 900. Ted then deposits that money into bank B. Bank B then lends out 810 bitcoins to Bob. Bob deposits the money into bank C. Bank C then lends 730 bitcons to Sue. Etc etc. So you can see that *no new money* is created with this process. However with only 1000 total bitcoins/cash originally deposited, over 2540 were lent out and paying interest back to the banks. This is all because banks only need to keep a fraction of reserves on hand. Again I want to stress, this is *not* literally creating new money, which is why it is still possible with bitcoins. This is just lending out the same bitcoin/dollar over and over again, so that multiple banks can collect interest on the same bitcoin/dollor at the same time.

it seems like blockchain explorers have a solution of sorts. You can query any wallet or transaction in real time with them. Theoretically, if the devs could build type of decentralized blockchain explorer into the bitcoin network, then there would be no need to download the entire blockchain. You would query the bitcoin network for transaction data and balance info rather than keeping the database locally.
You'd just have to offer some incentive for people to run their nodes to serve the bitcoin network's decentralized blockchain explorer. Some way to earn bitcoins for performing this function.

Actually, if they are converting to fiat, it will just put that many more coins on the market for sale and keep the price down.

Yes and No.
In the short term, it is somewhat true. For every dollar created by the federal reserve and "loaned" to the US government or member banks, there is a percentage of debt attached. So for example if the fed creates $100 and loans it to the US government, it expects to get paid $105 when the loan matures. In order to pay back this loan, the US government will have to take out a second loan to pay the first. Thus, a perpetual debt situation seems to be occurring.
**HOWEVER** what most people tend to miss in this situation, including our friend in this video, is that when the loan is paid back to the federal reserve, the interest paid on the loan is recirculated back into the economy, thus keeping the money supply even and balanced with the outstanding loans. All interest paid to the fed is deposited into the US treasury, and recirculated from there. In essence, when the US government pays the federal reserve interest, it is paying itself.
**FURTHER**, when that interest is recirculated back into the economy, it can be re-taxed by the US government as income and used **again** to pay down debt, and this process can repeat indefinitely. A single dollar bill can pay down 100 times it's value in debt if it is recirculated and re-taxed enough times.
So, like I said, yes and no.

Well, it's debatable, to be fair. By your representation above, the states CAN create their own money as long as it is gold or silver. But we both know that is not true.
Here is the real text, which specifically says states can not coin money, and then adds a qualifier that states they can not use money that is not gold or silver:


This, to me basically says that, yes only the fed can create money, but in order for the states to use it, it must be gold or silver. So the Fed can make money not based in gold or silver, yes. But only for international purposes. It can not be used within the union. Union money must be gold or silver.

Many altcoin features that are meant to "improve" upon bitcoin are short-sighted or just marketing gimmicks to foster excitement for their new coin.
A common example of a marketing gimmick would be to increase transaction confirmation times and then say their coin is "faster". Mathematically speaking, it is less secure as a result, and it is therefore a wash. Some would argue that faster confirmation times are a net loss given that security weighs heavier.
Another example: Take  the issue of bitcoin and the centralization of hashing power. This is perhaps the biggest criticism of bitcoin, and many altcoins have been created to specifically combat this issue, with hashing algorithms designed to be ASIC resistant. However, I qualify this as short-sighted. ASIC mining, in the long run, will even out such that it will be as easy for the average individual to get a competitive ASIC miner. The mining landscape will then experience decentralization and stop at a place much like it was when everyone was mining with GPUs. Why? Because improvements on ASIC miners are based on creating smaller, more power-efficient chips. Which is in turn based on the ability to reduce the nano-size. Physics dictate that there is a nano-wall that modern manufacturing processes will not be able to easily get beyond. This will cause ASIC improvements to halt. No longer will new generations of ASIC miners render previous generations obsolete. When this happens, the best ASIC chips will continue to be manufactured and sold, and their general availability to individuals will improve immensely, thus resulting in the decentralization of hashing power.

That is, they can be truly independent of *third-parties* and experience the truest form of monetary freedom.
Since that "utopia" doesn't exist today, several third-party companies that have been built in the past few years to mitigate many of the very problems that core's roadmap seeks to fix.

Two things:
1) If bitcoin needs to scale in parallel with bandwidth limitations, then that's not a bad thing. Regardless of how fast bandwidth increases, it *will* continue increasing, and thus bitcoin can safely scale along with it.
2) We are on the verge of a huge jump in residential bandwidth with gigabit infrastructure being rolled out all over the US (don't know about the world). Even if residential bandwidth hasn't been increasing as fast as we'd like, it's about to take a huge leap in the next few years. Until then, the current average broadband connection is capable of handling 2-3 times today's transaction rate and block size.

But shill accounts don't account for the general wide acceptance of a 2mb increase by important players in the bitcoin ecosystem... enough of an acceptance to fork the chain. That's not just bank propaganda, that's real community reaction. So regardless of how it happened, it's still a preference of the greater community.
One reason I don't agree that this is a propaganda campaign is because a 2mb increase in the block size limit is arguably *good* for bitcoin. So why would they use that to try to fracture the community? In succeeding they just implement a bitcoin improvement that the community wants. It doesn't make sense. Nope, i'm afraid that the community is split due to our own arguing and inability to compromise.

Regardless of how coinbase reports the transactions, you only owe taxes if you make money on the sale of bitcoin. Transferring bitcoin out of coinbase to another wallet is not taxable. The more coinbase reports non-taxable events incorrectly to the IRS, the more the IRS won't bother investigating any coinbase transfers, because they have very limited resources and are only interested in investigating people who honestly owe them money. Investigating people who don't owe them anything is a waste of their time, which would be 99.99% of what coinbase reports, if what this guy says is true.

My point is that they are trying to create an environment with the lowest possible barrier to entry for users who want true freedom, without reliance on third party services. In doing so, they are at odds with big companies whose existence relies on a higher barrier of entry that makes their services valuable.
A simple example are web wallet companies like coinbase and blockchain.info. If core can make it so every user can easily download a client and run their own wallet with minimal setup time and no third party reliance, it threatens those companies. The roadmap looks like it is working in that direction.

Credit card processors charge around 3% per transaction (it varies but i'm generalizing here).

Regular checks are kinda free but the bank is making money off your balance so in essence you're still paying for that service.

I don't think 'bailout' is a fair term to use. A bailout means to fund a failing (or failed) organization to prevent it from going bankrupt. That's not what is happening with DAO. They were not going bankrupt. They've had their coins stolen. Returning the stolen property is generally agreed upon in a civilized society as the right thing to do.
You can blame their shitty contract design, sure. But that doesn't mean it's okay to exploit a design flaw to execute the contract in a way that was not intended. Just like if you found a way to install windows 10 without a valid key, it doesn't mean it's okay to do it. It's still theft.

The media outlets used to make most of their money from subscriber fees. In this model, well researched, informative, and accurate information is what garnered subscribers and made money.

So in order to stay alive, they changed to an ad-based model and started giving away their content. Advertising revenue is dependent on clicks.

So you generate the random number from the SHA25 hash of the 3 components produced by the bitcoin network. That all makes sense. But you only use the last 9 hex digits to produce the random number. That's a max hex value of 0x0FFFFFFFFF. Or in decimal the maximum random number is 68,719,476,735. If each satoshi represents an entry then you can't have a jackpot larger than 687.19476735 bitcoins. I realize that's a high amount, but in theory it could happen. And if it ever did, every entry above 68,719,476,735 satoshi is screwed, because it's impossible for them to win.
So I guess my question is, why not use a larger random number? Most ideally one that is larger than all the satoshis that will ever be created?

Not that I am in support of it, but calculating the cost is not really a straight forward exercise. The money that is given out does not just disappear. It is expected to be spent, which will then create various types of tax revenue (sales, income, etc) that go back to the government. Then of course, that money continues to circulate creating more tax revenue each time it changes hands. And then there are the benefits of a boosted economy, which can generate more tax revenue. So at the end of the day, that $1000 dividend could all come right back to the government after circulating long enough.
This is all in theory, of course.

You're assuming they are printing the money that they give out as a dividend each and every time. I'm not so sure that is a safe argument. They could in theory reallocate the money away from other areas in order to raise the funds. And if my previous theory holds true, and the money eventually flows back to the government, then it becomes a self sustaining system after X number of dividends, with the money collected in tax revenue being sufficient to fund ongoing dividends.
Again, it's endlessly complicated with no right or wrong answer. But back to my original point, this is not a straight forward calculation.

I am trying hard to remain neutral on this issue. So as best as I can tell, the primary objection is that larger blocks will have a node centralization effect due to the increased bandwidth requirements of running said node. However, when pressed for details on why they think this, they have not been able to adequately defend it. But the best defense is something along the lines of: the block size is already too big because residential users can not run full nodes at home anymore and it is resulting in a centralization effect that we can already see, and thus increasing the size would exacerbate that problem. Which I would agree with if you can adequately show that the average home broadband user can not run a full node with today's block size. Because if they CAN, then it shows that 1) they arent being honest with the community, and 2) we can indeed scale up the block size with the safe assumption that bandwidth capacities will continue to get faster and cheaper in the future. Then the only question becomes, what is the proper rate to increase the block size.
It's gotten to the point that I purchased a small computer to set up a home node on my residential broadband connection to see if it can be done or not. The result of my experiment will finally push me to one side or the other in this debate.

Exactly. Let the free market operate. If comcast starts throttling netflix against their customer's wishes then that will create demand for a competitor to provide unthrottled access, and comcast will lose customers. Meanwhile my parents, who never watch netflix, have to pay for full unthrottled access to it because the government told comcast it can't provide cheaper plans that throttle video streaming sites.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:03:37
Naturally. Difficult issues are anything but black and white. The only fair way to deal with them is to let the debate play out and give time for the community to reach a consensus. And if consensus is never reached, the change is not merged. Yes, some people will be upset at that, but it's impossible for everyone to get what they want. This is the most pragmatic approach.
@_date: 2015-08-19 21:48:34


Yes I am aware of this argument. This is another one that has not been adequately defended, and can easily be criticized.
Blocks are discovered, on average, every 10 minutes. And it takes on average around 10 seconds for the block to propagate. This means that it is a *rare* occurrence that two miners discover a block within a close enough time that they compete to propagate it. I asked Greg Maxwell how often a block is orphaned due to this propagation competition and he said about 2% of the time. Assuming he is correct, this means 1 of every 50 blocks discovered by a given miner is orphaned because of this competition. I then asked if anyone did the math to find out if, given larger blocks brings more transaction fees, do the extra fees gained from the other 49 blocks offset the loss of the 50th block enough to give miners incentive to produce bigger blocks. And I also said if it does not, what about after next year's halving when the loss is reduced by 50%? He did not respond.
I understand that if a miner produces big blocks while others are producing small blocks that the orphan rate may increase above 2% and make the potential loss greater that what i described above. But how much greater? Whenever I ask around no one has actually done the math. So what this tells me is this is all speculation.
The core devs, as open-minded at I try to remain to be, have not given me anything to sink my teeth in to. No concrete numbers to back up their claims. At least not that i've seen.

Define "bitcoin development".
There is bitcoin core, which had over 100 contributors from all over the world that participated in the last major release. It is a fluid group of contributors that allows anyone to participate. I wouldn't call it a "team" since it is not a static group of people. People can come and go as they wish, and they can work on any part of the code they wish.
Then there are many groups independently working on ancillary improvements. There are at least 3 Lightning Network teams that I have heard of. Schnorr signatures are being researched independently. Confidential transactions are another independent effort that just recently made a breakthrough. I'm sure there are many more examples that I am unaware of. All of these are efforts that occur outside of the core project, but are vital to bitcoin's future success.
Then there are tons of other teams who have implemented wallets for various devices and platforms, who've developed libraries in different languages, and I think even a couple alternate full node implementations as well.
All of these groups represent "bitcoin development" in my opinion. As such, there are too many to count.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:50:14
I believe there are a handful of maintainers for the project who can do this, but usually it is done by Wladimir van der Laan. He is the "Lead Maintainer".
I'm curious why you think this is relevant. If you're going to suggest that he can act maliciously against the community by merging whatever he likes, or that this somehow represents a centralized development process, you'd be wrong. His actions are in the open and anything he does that the community does not agree to can be rolled back one way or another.
@_date: 2017-11-03 16:00:48
Somewhat agree. But we must also remember that bitcoin is designed to be decentralized, to connect users directly to each other without needing a middleman, and companies in general are a threat to that. In order for a company to be profitable in the bitcoin space, they must perform a service that in some way creates centralization. I agree that companies help make bitcoin "useful" but they should always be regarded as a potential threat and thus their opinions on the future of bitcoin should be taken with a very large dose of salt.
For any bitcoin company that exists today, there are people trying to create decentralized software to replace them. That is good for the users, but obviously the companies don't want that and will resist. That is why I say what I say about companies.

Guess you didn't read the far down in the article. This was explained. The offending address was imported into blockchain.info. The issue is that fitwear claims he never imported it.

No. If any of the maintainers (who have merge rights) decided to merge code without undergoing the proper process, it can be rolled back and that maintainer's rights can be revoked. Worst case, if all maintainers decided to work together against the community, then the project can be forked, the changes rolled back, and the community can continue moving ahead with the fork.
@_date: 2017-11-14 22:50:18
Changes are merged in to core based on feedback from both the technical and user communities. The degree of feedback required for the change is relative to it's impact. For example, a small bug fix only needs to be peer reviewed and tested by a small handful of contributors to be accepted. But something like a hard fork requires feedback from the entire community, and requires broad consensus, and that takes time and is not always a simple and straight forward process.
Generally speaking, if there is a controversial change that the community can not agree on it will not likely get merged. Whereas changes with broad community support get merged.
@_date: 2017-11-03 15:47:12


Core's interests lie with the users, which is why decentralization is their primary concern.
A companys primary concern is profits, which don't necessarily align with what is best for the users. Companies should not be coming together in an attempt to assert influence over the direction of bitcoin. Such an attempt should be actively resisted.
Also, "core" is a fluid group of around 100 active contributors from all over the world. The process for changing the software requires feedback from all participants. The bigger the change, the more consensus is required among them. It should not be referred to as if it is a small group if individuals making changes based on their own philosophies. This is what I try to drill into the head of those over at r/BTC but they can't seem to grasp it since it conflicts with their conspiracy theory that blockstream controls bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:12:21
I understand what you are saying but you are drastically misrepresenting reality to make your argument. There are many companies that already exist that have both the financial and technical ability to offer services in an area where there is currently only comcast. No one said it had to be a startup. But they don't compete in those areas because their research shows insufficient demand for a second option. If that changes because comcast starts pissing off their customers en mass, they would move in and compete, and you would start to see more options.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:03:07


I am literally aghast at the lack of foresight and imagination some people have regarding this issue. I am undoubtedly sure that there are many competitors with the financial backing and technical ability to move in to any area where only comcast exists. But they don't because their market research shows insufficient demand for more than 1 provider in that area. But if comcast suddenly starts upsetting their customers en mass, that market research starts to show a potential profit and the competitors will start to move in. Now the customers are better off because they have more options to chose from. This is how free market principals work, and it can't happen as long as big brother stifles this process through unnecessary regulation.
@_date: 2017-11-21 22:06:01
If there is no competition it is because the people aren't asking for it. If comcast suddenly started upsetting all their customers, for example charging the same price for less access, then demand for competition would suddenly change and you would see competitors move in.

You're getting downvoted but I agree with you. There is a lot in this report that is simply not explained well, or not explained at all. It's seems weird that a 400 page report would be lacking in details, but it is, and it makes me suspicious that they are reporting things that they can't show to be true one way or another.
Keeping this on the topic of bitcoin, one example is where they mention that the russians register domain names and purchase other online services that they used to disseminate the stolen emails. The report states that they paid in bitcoin and that they used a (paraphrasing) special kind of bitcoin transaction meant to conceal the source. I assume they are referring to a bitcoin mixer? If this is true, how did they track it to the russians? They simply don't explain this. Can these mixing transactions be beaten that easily?

People think the price is inflated due to bitfinex stopping all fiat withdraws. Customers of bitfinex are buying up bitcoins and transferring them elsewhere to protect themselves. This is increasing demand for bitcoin and driving up the price on bitfinex. This in turn drives up the price on other exchanges due to arbitrage.
If they are right, when bitfinex fixes fiat withdraws, we may see a mass selloff of bitcoin which will bring the price back down.

In Jihans latest blog post he indicates that it was his intention to have all of the miners call his server, and he would then remotely shut down miners at the request of the customer (if, for example, they were to get stolen). Similar to the iphones remote wipe features, which is executed by apple at the customers request.
If true, this would explain the hard coded domain name and the absence of any UI configuration.
But even so, in a decentralized and trustless environment such as bitcoin's, it's completely unethical to implement such a feature. I think Jihan is smart enough to know that. And given the fact that this incomplete "feature" somehow made it's way from a test branch in to the production code base, it makes me highly suspicious of Jihan's true intentions.
I am with you. The most likely explanation for this is that he was going to use it to wield control over the bitcoin ecosystem.

I'm not sure I really understand this statement. I think you misunderstand what trustless means as it relates to bitcoin. Trustless is the ability to exchange value between two parties without requiring a trusted third party to facilitate and guarantee funds. It is the digital equivalent of me handing you cash in person, except with bitcoin it can be done from across the world. And this is not "opinion". It is verifiably proven to be fact every day, every hour, and every minute.
With bitcoin there are no banks required to approve the transaction. No governing body can seize the funds or stop transactions. No party can reverse transactions. It's potentially the perfect monetary solution for the emerging global economy. If you can't see the value of having an electronic, stateless, and trustless currency in an ever-increasing connected world, then my friend you have some serious blinders on.

The core develpers at the HK meeting agreed to *propose* 2x hard fork, and made it clear that it would only be merged if it had broad community support. This language is right there in the agreement and you can verify it for yourself. 
Once segwit was announced, a large portion of the community rallied behind that since it was both a block size increase (2.4MB) as well as a soft fork ([and many other optimizations]( It was clearly a superior option. As such, broad community support for 2x was not achieved. The HK agreement then became defunct as a result. Core moved on to implement segwit, which did have broad community support. The miners then blocked segwit and told lies that core backed out of the HK agreement, which was not true.
The miners are not being honest, and for that reason I don't trust them. Pushing for a hard fork block size increase so soon after segwit makes no sense.

Exactly. We are on the same page here.


I see what you are saying. Unfortunately the agreement has many holes in it. It never stipulated a cutoff date for when broad support needs to be achieved by. After all, we can't wait forever. I think it was evident that there would never be broad support for a 2x hard fork as an add-on to segwit's implementation. It was important to let segwit play out for a period of time before considering further scaling options. A sufficient amount of the community agreed with this.


They wanted a block size increase, yes. I don't believe it was necessary that it be a hard fork, although all assumptions at the time were that only a hard fork would make it possible. What they got was segwit, a 2.5MB soft fork block size increase, with a malleability fix. By any reasonable measurement, it was superior to a 2MB hard fork.

I feel like you're shifting your position in order to defend your previous post. It seemed evident to me you were talking about the value of bitcoin on a per-individual basis, and such was the context of my first reply. But in this response you are now referring to hypothetical attacks and ledger rollbacks that affect the entire network and all of its users. Yes these possibilities exist, but they are extremely remote, and get more so every day as the network continues to grow and become more robust. In the mean time, individuals can still transact on the bitcoin network with a very high degree of confidence and safety. This is proven every day.


As an individual, no participant in any transaction can reverse it without requiring vast amounts of infrastructure and computing power, so much so that it is next to impossible to acquire and unreasonable to consider as a valid concern.
If the community as a whole decides to roll back the ledger, that is a different issue with a different argument, and it all depends on the nature of the issue as to whether is a positive or negative result for the individuals affected. 


Miners don't approve transactions, the network as a whole approves them. Thousands of nodes all work together to verify transactions. This is not a third party. It is a decentralized network. And if a miner chooses not to confirm your transaction, another miner will. So again, even single miners can't exert control over the individual. And if no miners approve your transaction, you simply didn't include a high enough fee. If that happens, it isn't because a third party exerted control over your funds. It's because the network made a decision about transaction priority completely regardless of the individuals or amount involved in the transaction. Whereas a bank can choose to exert control based on these factors.


I am not talking about a government seizing assets. No one can stop that, which is obvious. You're again missing the point of bitcoin here. I am talking about a government freezing your bank account, stopping your credit cards, and making it impossible to use money. With bitcoin, that doesn't exist. If you control your keys, the government can't stop you from using them. Even if they try to seize your computers, a reasonable amount of protection can stop them from getting your keys.


Stateless means bitcoin is not limited by the borders of any given state. i.e. it is borderless. In this context, "state" is a synonym for a country. No i wasn't trying to sound sophisticated. It was a perfectly appropriate word when talking about the value bitcoin has in a global economy.

No it can't. It can only loan what it has in reserve, save for the fraction they are required to hold. What happens is, someone takes a loan from bank A to pay Joe. Joe deposits it in to bank B. Bank B then loans out portion of that deposit. Now you have two loans based on the same money. This process can continue  for a total of about 9 or 10 times before diminishing returns kicks in.
At no point is any bank creating money. it's simple a matter of loans being deposited in other banks and reloaned.
This process is absolutely possible with Bitcoin.

@_date: 2015-09-05 22:00:20
I'll give it one last shot to illustrate my point. First let me make a clarification:
When I refer to "creating money" I am literally referring to inflating the money supply... l that is, literally creating fiat where there was none prior, whether digitally in a computer or printing it off a press.
When some people talk about how fractional reserve banking "creates money" they are *not* being literal. They are being figurative because the result is similar to creating new money, but it is not literally creating new money. At least not in the United States. In the US, only the federal reserve can create new money, and even then it requires congressional approval.
Let me illustrate how banks are not *literally* creating new money with fractional reserve lending:
1. Bob deposits $10 in Bank A
2. Bank A lends out $9 to Joe.
3. Joe then pays Steve the $9 that he was loaned to pay for home improvements.
4. Steve deposits that $9 in Bank B.
5. Bank B then loans out $7.90 to Jack.
This process above allows for a single $10 deposit to be *lent* to more than one individual. But it is important to understand that lending *is not* creating. At no point in the process above did any bank literally create new money. No one duplicated that original $10 deposit. It was simply passed from one entity to the next leaving in it's path nothing but IOUs between previous owners. Again, IOUs (or loan agreements) are not creating new money.
So, on the issue of whether bitcoin prevents this process, the answer is no, because no new bitcoins are being created. Let me illustrate how the above scenario would work with bitcoin:
1. Bob deposits 10 bitcoins in Bank A.
     - Bank A now holds the private keys to all 10 bitcoins
2. Bank A lends out 9 bitcoins to Joe.
     - Bank A now holds the private keys to 1 bitcoin
     - Joe holds the private keys to 9 bitcoins
3. Joe then pays Steve the 9 that he was loaned to pay for home improvements.
     - Steve now holds the private keys to 9 bitcoins
4. Steve deposits those 9 bitcoins in Bank B.
     - Bank B now holds the private keys to 9 bitcoins
5. Bank B then loans out 7.90 bitcoins to Jack.
     - Bank B holds the private keys to 1.1 bitcoins
     - Jack holds the private keys to 7.9 bitcoins
     - Bank A still holds the private keys to 1 bitcoin
Again, the above illustrates how it is possible to loan the same 10 bitcoin deposit to more than one person, and at no point were any new bitcoins created, and at no point was the bitcoin protocol violated The only thing that was created were loan agreements, and again, loan agreements are not the same as literally creating new money.
Hope this helps you to understand. The idea that banks can create new money (in the literal sense) is where you are misinformed. Figuratively, yes. Bit not literally. And on this topic, it is only literal that matters.

Most people still don't understand what this is supposed to be used for, and that's 21's fault, I guess. They don't make it clear on their website. But when I saw a screen shot of the API, I got it. Light bulbs went off in my head and I ordered one that day. I'm excited for it to arrive.
For those who still don't get it: it is a hardware/software combo made to interface with a new digital marketplace. Think ebay when it first started. Yes you could have created your own website and sold stuff that way. But ebay brings buyers and sellers together and provides useful tools to make the process of buying and selling easy and safe. This is what 21 is doing. They have built a bitcoin marketplace for digital goods, and for now, the only way to participate in it is via their device.
I don't believe they are in the business of scamming people. The bitcoin miner is likely necessary to give 21 enough hash power to guarantee micro-transactions are confirmed somewhat timely. So allowing people to participate without their miner would be like leeching from the system, in a sense.

Let's just assume what you say is correct... You're saying that 85% of USA residents CAN handle big blocks. That's 250 million people. And that's JUST THE USA. I'd say this is a better argument in favor of big blocks, not against.
Besides that, I am willing to bet by tweaking the maxconnectons parameter, more of those rural residents could run a node than you think. Another thing small blockers seem to conveniently ignore is that you can effectively control your node's bandwidth utilization by changing the maxconnections parameter.
@_date: 2015-11-28 15:48:18


Not for people with an average broadband connection. Even if your below-average connection chokes a little bit, you can use the bitcoin.conf maxconnections setting to reduce bandwidth usage. So in reality, bandwidth is not really an issue.
The core devs have pivoted away from the bandwidth usage argument to a new and more shiny argument: block propagation.

If the concern of big blocks is the bandwidth requirement, then this solves nothing since a key block plus several micro blocks is the same size as one big block containing the same transactions. I would guess it's even more. So again, unless I misunderstand, I don't see what it solves.

It's been repeatedly implied that core will not officially release code supporting BIP148 for political reasons. They don't want their support of BIP148 to be interpreted as a centralized controlling influence on the future of bitcoin. They want the users to step up and take action without the direction of core. They want a true decentralized change. In order for BIP148 to be successful, it must be a grass roots campaign among the users.
I encourage everyone who is running a full node and supports segwit to set your node to signal support for BIP148. You can find instructions and further information here: 
@_date: 2017-10-19 20:14:48
If you don't have port 8333 opened to your node, you are not running a full node. You are only running a wallet node, sometimes referred to as a leeching node.
A full node requires that port 8333 is open and available for connections. Then your node will join the bitcoin network and help propogate transactions and blocks, ignoring those which do not conform to consensus rules, which in turn helps to enforce those rules.
You can also use your full node as your wallet as well, which is really the point of using bitcoin. Without running your own full node, you must rely on a third party to supply you information about the state of the network, which means you are not trustless and therefor not truly free.
That's why it is so important that the bar for running a full node be kept as low as reasonably possible.
@_date: 2015-11-08 00:09:59


The question wasn't about attack vectors in bigger blocks, so your point is moot.


You must be way below the world average. If you adjust the maxconnections param you'll probably be fine with bigger blocks. I have no problem running a full node on my home comcast connection and have plenty of bandwidth to spare. 
@_date: 2015-11-07 22:32:39


Mike stated earlier that changing the block size limit does not change the block size. Hence the bandwidth requirement would be the same as core. I'm sure that's what he meant for his answer to infer. He has a way of saying things... without saying things. He's also not wrong, since the asker did not quantify his question with a specific size.

Don't nodes apply their rules to the economic activity of their neighboring nodes by choosing what to accept and reject? If a node that generates economic activity is connected to all nodes that enforce a different set of rules, those nodes will deny that activity, thus enforcing their network rules without directly generating economic activity themselves. Am I wrong here?


Hmmm... miners broadcast blocks to other miners initially to help reduce their orphan rate, yes. But that only matters for the first few seconds when a block is found. The blocks still need to propagate across the network to all nodes. And those nodes then choose whether to accept or reject the blocks, thus enforcing the network rules that the nodes have adopted. This process would suggest that the set of rules that is being enforced by the largest percentage of nodes will result in the longest chain.
I think we are both advocating for segwit, so I don't want to come off as argumentative. But it was my impression that the entire point of BIP148 was to leverage the power and influence that nodes have by choosing what gets propagated around the network and what doesn't. This process has little to do with whether those nodes generate economic activity themselves.

Did the transaction eventually confirm after the 3 hour window? Got a transaction id?

Am I not achieving monetary sovereignty this way?

I keep reading this in various threads but I don't understand it. I'm wondering if this is part of some sort of anti-BIP148 disinformation campaign or something.
Aren't nodes in general responsible or propagating network activity such as transactions and blocks? If most of the nodes are enforcing BIP148, even if they don't generate economic activity, don't they still enforce network rules by **not** propagating transactions and blocks that don't conform? I'm pretty sure I've read different comments from core developers specifically stating that a node percentage is important for BIP148, such as 51% of nodes.

I haven't downloaded and ran it in over a month, but from what I remember it had a long way to go. I mean, a LONG way to go. Despite the developers supposedly being "active", they have yet to release anything remotely close to a usable product. It was confusing to install and run, and very buggy once you got it running. It was very slow, and it crashed constantly and needed to be restarted. You couldn't see more than 30-something stores, and of those stores, browsing their products was clunky and often caused crashes. The search function, which is a critical feature IMO, didn't work. If you wanted to list an item for sale, or purchase something, the process to do that was less than intuitive, to put it nicely.
I think the idea of a decentralized marketplace is great but I have my doubts about the design decisions being made. I get the impression the developers are scattered and there is no clear direction or leadership.

Again, not to come off as argumentative, but I don't believe what you are saying is correct.

It takes time to reliably measure consensus via signaling. Once consensus is reached, the change is "locked in" but not active until some future date. This window is to allow everyone to update their software to be compatible with the change.

The point of bitcoin is that it is a decentralized trustless electronic currency with pseudo-anonymous properties.

But none of that can stop governments of the world from creating rules and regulations around it's use. The US did it with gold in the 30s when it outlawed the ownership of it.

I'm not sure what kind of connection "most users in the world" have, but in well developed countries with good broadband infrastructure, running a node is no problem, unless you're like Luke-Jr and still use DSL technology from 10 years ago, and somehow try to claim that as evidence of blocks being too big.
Anyways, we don't need people in the congo running full nodes in order to be decentralized. The countries that are well connect today have average speeds that are beyond sufficient for a full node and will provide more than enough decentralization.
@_date: 2017-05-19 18:53:04
If it's truly decentralized, then it doesn't matter what the core devs prefer, or what they "deem" it. With enough support it'll get implemented, regardless. So i'm not exactly sure what your point is except to complain that your preferred solution doesn't seem to have the necessary support behind it to get implemented.
Besides, SW is virtually agreeable to everyone. The scaling debate isn't about SW, it's about hard forking to bigger block sizes. There's no justifiable reason to withhold support for SW, except for those who want to use use it as a negotiating tool for bigger blocks... even though the requirement for bigger blocks is seemingly arbitrary, and therefor foolish, until we learn how SW works in production.

Aren't nodes responsible for enforcing the network rules? If so then that would suggest the node count is important, since non-conforming transactions and blocks will fail to propagate across the network.

4.0? The 0.1 release should be a somewhat proof of concept, and i wouldn't necessarily give you that much yet.
I just think you guys are trying to do too many things at once and it's creating confusion. You only need to start with 3 things:
1. Listing products for sale (easily and intuitively) - You only need to collect a price, title, and short description. Just a single item. No inventory management. No images. Links to images hosted on a third-party site can be entered into the description.
2. Searching products - Search against product title and description.
3. Buying products - The buyer clicks a button when he decides to buy. This de-lists the item for sale. The software tells the buyer how the seller can be contacted. This can be a simple textarea field that the seller fills out for his "store", and he can enter anything from email to phone number to bitmessage. Then they can work out payment and delivery privately
^^ Implemented in that order.
All the other stuff (arbitrators, bitmessage, bitcoin, inventory, images, rating system, etc) can come *after* you actually prove the concept of buying and selling, in it's simplest form, in a decentralize marketplace.

Cause it's not true. It's a common misconception I often see here on and it bugs me to no end. I try my best to explain why it isn't true but I just get downvoted in spite of being right. Nonetheless, i'll try explaining it again:
Yes, there *IS* enough money (USD) to pay off the entire national debt. The reason it is possible is quite simple: Money used to pay off a portion of the national debt (a bond, for example) is recirculated back in to the economy where it can be re-taxed and used to further pay off debt, ad infinitum. Theoretically the entire national debt can be paid by a single dollar bill if taxed and recirculated enough times.

Signalling, which is used to lock in a change, happens on a different bit. But the change itself, the segwit code, should be compatible on both core and segwit2x.

Right now, anyone who tries to do business by accepting gold will be shut down and prosecuted. There is no reason why they can't do the same with bitcoin.
You guys need to stop living in the clouds about bitcoin. I am as much of a fan as the next person. But the governments of the world are all most certainly capable of outlawing bitcoin, and thus severely hindering it's value and it's growth, if they choose.

These are fair points. Governments can literally decide Bitcoin is illegal or they can regulate it in some manner that devalues it. Bitcoin could also collapse under it's own growth as certain shortcomings in the protocol become more relevent.

Who's talking about bartering? Currency is a replacement for bartering. It is not a form of bartering itself.
If enough people are using bitcoin as an actual currency, that's when the governments start to take notice and will eventually be forced to make a decision.
Last I knew, at least in the USA, the federal government is explicitly given the power to create and regulate the currency by the constitution. When a competing currency comes into play, it is within the domain of the federal government to regulate it in any way it sees fit. That includes banning it outright. They've already done it with gold. Gold is no longer a currency in the USA as of the 1970s. It is actually illegal to accept gold as payment for goods and services.

I think bitcoin will always exist for black market purposes. As for legitimate purchases, the future is unclear. The real risk starts when governments recognize that they are loosing a significant amount of tax revenue due to unregulated bitcoin transactions. If that happens, it's a virtual guarantee the government will make some sort of (likely unfavorable) decision regarding bitcoins that will have an impact on it's future.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:59:41
Again, it is not illegal until the government explicitly states that bitcoin is illegal, or a court case determines it as such. Neither of which has happened.
All we have is an out of context comment by someone representing the central bank, who is not a policy maker.

Sure. The [wiki on scaling]( says the following:


This suggests changing the way bitcoin works today. Changing it from a decentralized currency, and adding a bit of centralization to it (backbone nodes).
This is a scary idea. It means that backbone nodes will control the the bitcoin network, which moves control away from the average joe. And as such, a degree of freedom and security is lost.
I am not saying there isn't a scaling solution. But I am saying that a solution will result is fundamentally changing what makes bitcon so powerful and free.
Plainly speaking, the wiki admits, it can not scale without adding a degree of centralization. The more it needs to scale, the more centralization it requires.
Granted, this will not happen any time soon. But I do believe it will lead to bitcon eventually being taken over by a different currency that can salve the scaling problem and maintain decentralization.
I'm not a developer for bitcon but i've read developer responses on this issue on this subreddit, and on bitcontalk, where they admit their difference in opinion and say things like "we will just have to wait and see what happens". I am not going to try to google and find the threads I read, but they are out there. 
Here is a white paper describing the scalability problems bitcoin has, and proposes an alternative way to built a cryptocurrency that may solve the problems. As of yet, no one has tried to implement his solution.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:26:24
It's ok for the occasional block to reach that limit. As long as subsequent blocks are under the limit, transactions will be processed timely. The problem occurs when the majority of blocks are over the limit.
According to the last 7 blocks listed on blockchain.info, the current average size is 261KB. So bitcoin could tolerate 4 times the current transaction rate before this starts becoming a problem. It's hard to predict when that might happen. Depends on the adoption rate of bitcoin. Could be 6 months. Could be 6 years.
@_date: 2013-12-23 16:59:52
Let's just be clear that the Fed does not collect taxes. Taxes will, if anything, be the primary reason governments step in and do something about bitcoin. If enough people are conducting bitcon transactions to facilitate the exchange of good and services (rather than speculating on it's future price like commodity trading, which is what is happening now) it will force the governments hand to regulate it in order to prevent tax revenue loss.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:39:44
Regardless, no such declaration by the government has been made. No court case has determined bitcoin to be of the category that the law restricts. So until that happens, bitcoin is considered a good, just like a loaf of bread. And as such, is under no restriction.
Could it be determined in the future that bitcoin is a foreign currency? Sure, but until that happens, articles like this serve little purpose but to stir up controversy, and mislead people.
@_date: 2013-12-19 17:28:32
This is nonsense, as is the title of this post. The Icelandic government made no such declaration that trading in bitcoin is illegal. They made a law placing restrictions on the exchange of foreign currency. The Icelandic government has to first declare that bitcoin is a foreign currency before the law applies to it, and that hasn't happened, nor is there any indication that it will happen.
All the article states is that the central bank *thinks* bitcoin could be considered a foreign currency. But the central bank doesn't make policy. It is likely run by old and out of touch people with little to no idea what bitcoin actually is, so I wouldn't give much weight to their opinion on the matter.

I don't really understand your question. Are you asking how merchants can accept bitcoins?
If yes, then all they have to do is display their wallet address to the buyer and wait for payment to come in before completing the transaction.
You don't need a payment provider like paypal. That is the whole point of bitcoin. It circumvents that sort of centralized exchange of money that we currently need for fiat.

Bitcoin is not the internet. I'm not sure what you are trying to infer with your post. If you are suggesting that governments can't have an impact on bitcoin, think again.
I agree that they can't shut bitcoin down. But through enacting laws, they can severely inhibit it's growth and value.  Hypothetically, if they wanted to ban bitcoin, all they would have to do is declare bitcoin transactions as illegal and start prosecuting merchants who accept it. Everyone else will fall in line real quick. But bitcoin will still exist for the black market.

Bitcoin is fluctuating because of all the speculating on it's future price. The same way stocks fluctuate on any given trading day.

The only tax laws that apply to bitcoin are when you convert it to USD or when you convert it to a taxable asset.
But bitcoin transactions themselves are not taxed. And income from a bitcoin-only business (that does not convert it to USD) is easy to conceal from the IRS. These make sales tax and income tax a problem for bitcoin. Eventually the government will have to step in and do something to prevent tax loss.

A paper wallet is the easiest way to *give* someone a BTC. But not the best option if you expect them to actually use it. Importing a paper wallet into a usable electronic format isn't exactly a straight forward process for a non-technical person.
Honestly, my advice is simply train the recipient on the technical aspects of BTC. I think that is a requirement if you expect them to actually understand and appreciate the gift. If this person lacks the technical wherewithal to comprehend the technical nature of BTC, you probably shouldn't give them any.

From the translated article:


That means that it is not legal as a means of currency for goods and services. Which, shouldn't be news to anyone. It is this way for all countries.
So why aren't the governments shutting it down then? Because it is not worth their effort to do so. The majority of bitcoin holders are speculators and traders. They don't actually use it as a currency. As long as the majority are speculating, there is no law breaking. Once enough people use it as an actual currency to exchange for goods and services, that is when the governments of the world will be forced to step in and take an official stance, in order to preserve their tax revenue. The stance that they will take will not likely be favorable, as it will probably impose regulations, if not outright ban it.

I think the solution you're aiming for would have to be custom built. As far as I know, coinbase does not work like that. It does not keep multiple phone numbers tied to multiple wallet addresses, and does not notify via sms a specific phone number based on the wallet that got paid, all within a single account.
And even if it did, who manages the account? It would have to be someone they all agree to trust with their money.
I don't know. Seems difficult to pull off.

You're suggesting that bitcoin can not be shut down totally due to black market transactions. I agree with that and I even stated that in my post you replied to.
With regard to legitimat transactions, all the government has to do is pass a law. That simple act alone is enough to get 99% of the merchants to stop accepting bitcoin. The remaining 1% can be easily identified and prosecuted if they are still openly accepting bitcoins. Everyone else will be forced to operate in the black market.

I mean, technically, any increase in wealth is taxable. So if someone gives me 10 BTC and I buy a car with it, yes I have to pay tax on that car. But what about something like sales tax? What is the law that says we must pay sales tax on BTC transactions?


... which is exactly why I stated the government would be forced to step in an regulate it. Through regulation they could improve reporting. I don't agree with comparing paypal to bitcoin. Too many fundamental differences in their purpose and scope.

For this to be true, the "common people" who are using bitcoin must outweigh those who are not. You need a majority to have an influence on the government. And that is not the case today in any country, nor will it be the case when and if a government is forced to make a ruling on bitcoin. 
I'm sorry but I am having a hard time understanding your logic.
Most governments will not rule on bitcoin until they recognize a significant tax revenue being lost. When that happens, bitcoin users will still be a minority. Thus, if the government should choose to ban bitcoin as a currency for goods and services, that minority will have little power to stop it. And the majority of people who don't use bitcoin and probably dont even know what it is, won't care about it's banning (or regulation).

Paypal is not bitcoin. Paypal is a payment provider to facilitate transactions in USD. But USD is the currency paypal uses and USD transactions are taxed. Even if paypal doesn't change the tax itself, the sellers and buyers are still required by law to pay taxes on USD transactions. Whether it is income tax from a sale, or state sales tax.
Bitcoin is totally different. It is a currency itself. And as a currency, there are no tax laws that apply to it. The government would be forced to either tax it, or ban it as a currency like they did with gold in the 70s.

No offense but that sounds like a copout. I am not financial expert but I understand the basic tax laws pretty well. Try me.
For example, I know I have to pay capital gains tax on income from bitcoin investing. But that is only when I convert it to USD, which I covered in my original post. 
But in a scenario where we are not converting to USD, and where large numbers of people are holding a BTC balance and trading goods and services for BTC (business and customers alike) how is something like a sales tax currently implemented? And, theoretically, if a business operated with BTC only (meaning it sold products for BTC and used BTC to finance it's operating expenses) how does the current income law tax cover that?

Generate a different wallet address for each transaction (assuming it is trivial to do). Should solve that problem. Or rotate though a series of addresses such that payments aren't hitting the same address so often that you have trouble identifying the sender.
I don't know. It seems like using a third party service to do something that is inherently built in to bitcoin sort of defeats the purpose of it. You are probably paying fees to those services that you don't have to.

I think the answer is different depending on what type of corporation we are talking about, and how they conduct business.
But I think you're going to find that the general answer is something like this: Rolling out bitcoin on a large scale costs millions of dollars in equipment and training. It is not worth it right now. There are not enough people demanding to pay with bitcoin. It will only be worth it to corporations when the amount of revenue they are loosing by not accepting bitcoins exceeds the amount of money it would cost to implement it.

Not trying to be a dick, but this is economics 101. When supply outweighs demand, price goes down. Your sell order of 90k bitcoins would have dumped a huge supply of bitcoins on to the market, thus driving  the price down in order to find buyers for them.

Maybe this is a dumb question since I am fairly new to bitcoin, but why are you using a third party service to facilitate bitcoin transactions?

The protocol has limitations. It can tolerate about 4 times the current transaction rate before transactions become bottlenecked and the whole system becomes unreliable.
Now, can the devs change the node software to address this issue? Sure, that is the easy part. What is considerably harder, if not impossible, is getting every node on the bitcoin network to update at the exact same time. THAT is the basis of my concern. I don't see how that would be feasible.

You are correct. Especially with the following statement:


All of bitcoins current value is speculative. It is not based in real transactions for goods and services.
Here is the irony of that situation. The more the trend turns towards real transactions for goods and services, the more the governments of the world will be forced to take a position on bitcoin. Why? Tax revenue. Right now, the governments are not really losing any significant revenue, because speculators still pay taxes once they convert back to fiat and claim any income from that investment.
But people who conduct goods and services transactions are circumventing certain tax liabilities. The more people that do that, the more we will bring about government regulation of bitcoin to prevent tax revenue loss.

You are downplaying the difficulty of a 51% attack. With the amount of nodes on the network, and the amount added every day, it is next to impossible to achieve control over 51% of them.

The fact that they are admittedly at odds with regard to the best way to fix it. Also, changing the node software to be more scalable would be very difficult.

Here is some official documentation on scalability, which mentions the current limitation on the transaction rate.
The tone of this document, however, should be taken with a grain of salt. It is written in a tone that suggests there is no scalability problem, and that any issue can be overcome. What it doesn't state is that developers are in disagreement over what is the best solution. And what it also doesn't state is that essentially any solution will likely introduce a new problem that may be worse that the one it fixes. Or the solution will require a degree of centralization, which removes an equal degree of freedom.
I think the transaction rate can be increased slowly by increasing the block size incrementally over time. And that's probably what they'll do. But eventually a limit will be reached, so such a fix can only be temporary.
However, I am not a bitcoin developer (although I am a software developer). So take everything I am saying with a grain of salt and do your own research. These are things that I have extrapolated by "reading between the lines".

Actually, it kind of is a "hands in the air" sort of situation. The devs have already stated that they want the community to find a solution. A move that oddly disconnects themselves from being responsible for fixing the issue.
I think we all know that bitcoin can only tolerate so many transactions a second, and that the transaction rate is nowhere close to being able to support any sort of wide global adoption. So why not fix the problem now, while we are still in the early stages of adoption? Why do the devs remain strangely silent and unmotivated by this issue?

If the government could assert that, by using bitcoins instead of official currency, the merchants are circumventing their tax burdon, then you bet your ass the government will step in and do something about it. The government does not mess around with their tax revenue, especially when they need it to fund government operations.
I'm not saying they WILL ban bitcoin in this scenario. depending on the state of bitcoin at that time, they may choose to regulate it. And there are many options to do that without having to impose changes to the protocol or software. For example, the government could require all merchants to register their wallet address with the government so they can audit the merchants transactions and tax them based on what they find in the blockchain.

If there is one thing that will bring about the downfall of bitcoin, it is this blocksize limitation issue.
Whenever the bitcoin developers are asked about it, they have differing opinions and generally state that they expect the "community" to find a solution. But they do not have a solution themselves, and they tend to take the stance that "we should just wait and see what happens".
This concerns me. It is as if they are intentionally remaining un-opinionated about it due to not really have any viable solutions and not wanting to cause a scare.
There is a wiki that states this is not a problem. But when reading that wiki, I was not comforted one bit.
The issue is, each block size has a limit of 1MB. That is enough for the entire bitcoin network to process about 7 transactions a second. Right now, the network is processing 2 or 3 transaction a second. That means that bitcoin can grow in usage about 2.5 times it's current transaction rate before transactions become bottlenecked and are not processed timely, if at all. The more bitcoin grows beyond the 7 transactions/second limitation, the more the bottlenecking occurs and the worse the situation gets.
This will result in higher transaction fees, because the transactions with higher fees will get processed, and the transactions with little or no fees will be left behind, unprocessed for an undetermined amount of time.
The dev team can not easily raise the block size limit. Such a change would require an update to the node software and would have to be updated on all bitcoin nodes at the exact same time, which is impossible. Even if they could increase the blocksize limit, such a fix would only be temporary until the new limit is reached, and then the problem occurs again.
I would like to think there will be a solution to this, but I am scared that there won't be one without compromising what makes bitcoin so powerful. That is, a decentralized currency system with low fees.

If you're going to display the BTC price for each item on the website (if I am understanding correctly), then how will you contend with the constant fluctuation in value?
@_date: 2013-12-20 15:35:53
First, only display a BTC price after the customer has started the checkout process and has picked bitcoin as their payment method. At that point, how you display the currency symbol is relatively inconsequential, since the buyer already knows he is paying with bitcoin. Keep it simple and just display the total cart items and shipping as "0.014 BTC".

In order to take bitcoin payment, you only need to show the customer your bitcoin wallet. No payment provider required, not even bitpay or coinbase as someone else suggested.
Now, a potential issue could happen where you may receive a payment and not know which customer sent it. This could be remedied by asking for the customers wallet address so you can match the sending address to the customer. Alternatively you could generate a new bitcoin wallet for each customer. That way you could match the wallet address that received the payment to the customer.
It really depends on the volume of orders you receive as to whether that will be a problem.

How do you know he didn't? Perhaps the 33M bitcoins taken by the feds was just a portion of what he had.

Does your iPhone come with a data plan? If so you can use any one of the many online wallet services.

Marginally better but still not ideal.
Bitcoin makes a lot of things easier, but one thing it requires is an internet connection. Without it, i'm not really sure one can accept bitcoins reliably. I really think, at a minimum, a smart phone is necessary. merchants need to be able to check a their wallet address on blockchain.info to confirm that they received payment.
Another thing I just thought of is that SMSs can be faked. So can automated phone calls, although probably a bit harder.

Not normal. Contact coinbase support or post on @_date: 2013-12-24 20:59:28
This had crossed my mind too. Lots of bitcoin gifts being sold for fiat could actually cause a dip in price.

In order to take money from a bitcoin wallet you need both the wallet address and the private key. If you don't have those, you can't take the funds. Not you, not me, not the FBI.

Tough love comment: I wouldn't buy. Don't particularly care for the design. I never heard of the term "math money" either.
Also, maybe it's just me, but I don't like buying shirts where the picture is of a blank shirt with the logo digitally overlaid. I like to see a photo of the real shirt.

They don't have to impose a regulation into the bitcoin protocol. All they have to do is make a declaration regarding bitcoins transactions in general. Specifically towards merchants who accept bitcoin.
Theoretically, if a government wanted to ban bitcoin, all they would have to do is start arresting and shutting down merchants who accept it. Once they do that, everyone else will fall in line and bitcoin will be reduced to the black market.

Why not just create a paper wallet and put it in a fireproof safe? 
@_date: 2013-12-20 16:23:38
OK fair enough. As long as you are not worried about confusing shoppers who don't know what bitcoin is and who don't know why that strange other price is listed or what it means.
@_date: 2013-12-04 19:17:20
Probably a little to soon for such a dramatic move, considering you can't spend bitcoin at your local grocery store or movie theater. What is your plan when bitcoin isn't an option? You have a load of cash stuff in your mattress?

3 hours? I started last night as well. It's been about 15 hours and I am still downloading/synchronizing.
