I was using the poster's language that I replied to, to convey my point fellow Canadian. Obviously nothing was "decided" in a meeting by the people, but the market made it possible for the loonie to strengthen. And here is the answer by Canada's central bank, and that was "decided", 2011 article:  
  
  
  
&amp;gt; "The announcement in the U.S. that interest rates won't go up any time soon is public policy makers saying to consumers, there is no reward in saving your money, so don't think about saving for your retirement or a rainy day, you might as well spend it now in the hope that this consumer spending will stimulate the economy and lead to job creation."
Canada will have no choice but to follow suit in cutting rates, said Hlinka.  
  
&amp;gt;"To raise interest rates would drive up the Canadian dollar, making our exports that much less competitive. Now it seems almost inevitable that the next move for our benchmark interest rates will be down."
But that could push the country into a deep and prolonged recession with record levels of private debt, according to Hlinka.
Cutting interest rates could further overheat the housing market and encourage people to spend beyond their limits, creating a bubble that will soon burst, predicts Hlinka.
He points to Vancouver, a city whose housing market has cooled considerably this summer, as a harbinger of things to come for Toronto and other Canadian cities.  
  
Make of that what you will.  
  
Edit: a few words

Don't be so rude guys. He seems like he's pulling our knee here, I mean all one has to do is spend 5 minutes on this sub and they'll have the answer. Still, what if he's a total newb?
MtGox suspended bitcoin withdrawals recently, blaming a problem on the Bitcoin protocol, which exists but isn't a big problem since a workaround is easy implement (as has been done in less than 24 hours in other exchanges). It's already almost impossible to withdraw fiat from Gox so people lost trust in the exchange. Add to the fact that Gox moved offices to a virtual address...

You should consider changing the way you place an order. If you're gonna introduce btc/ltc for example, it'll be a pain to copy paste prices or amounts, if we could just click on them, boom it shows up in the appropriate field.Also, the drop down menu thing is really annoying, to choose between cryptos and USD or cad. Tabs like btc-e has are so much easier to work with.When you introduce trading between cryptos, please make it like all the other exchanges out there, ie btc/ltc price is 0.02535 as opposed to how Cavirtex is doing it, btc/ltc price is 40 ltc (same thing really but I gotta divide if I wanna compare price to other exchanges)Other than that I really like you guys, keep up the good work.

I've yet to purchase anything with bitcoins, but I'd imagine that for the sake of simplicity, merchants would include the tax in the btc price. Who in their head can calculate what the 8% tax of 0.374950584 BTC is? I could be wrong though
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:57:35

if you can't stomach something like this, sell and never buy bitcoin again, especially if you need the money for a "transaction" - never invest money you need within a few days.
Otherwise, brace for impact. but don't worry, it'll rise in value again in the coming weeks and months.

I know the whole issue has been about withdrawals, but can people still deposit BTC on mtgox? If so, that's the icing on the cake!I feel bad for whoever has money and coins stuck there. I'm really glad I didn't get verified with them due to their incompetence after 1+ month of waiting otherwise now my money would be in the pockets of the magical tux. All being said, mtgox needs to stop existing.
@_date: 2014-03-05 02:09:04
I live in Canada. That's what I was thinking about. I usually calculate the hst in my head so I know how much I need to pay, sometimes I gotta make sure I have enough. With BTC I guess you can ask the merchant what it would work out to with tax. Have you bought anything with btc here. How does it work?

What the fuck does that even mean. I took them a lot of words to say nothing!
And it seems like they will re-brand otherwise they'd just come out and say it at this point.
Edit: a couple of words at the end of the last sentence
@_date: 2014-03-04 17:46:39
So they're saying Bitcoin isn't a currency, but if you make purchases with it, you'll get taxed 8%, which I'm sure will be factored in the BTC price of the goods you're buying.
At the same time capital gains tax at 20% seems good and bad. I write this from a Canadian's perspective: here we pay tax on 50% of our capital gains at whatever tax bracket we fall in that year, so if you make big bucks, you'd be paying more than 20% on all your gains.
This is good news I think, what did we expect, for BTC to be an exception? I just don't agree with securities companies not being able to handle Bitcoin...that's limiting

Yup that would be the only way to do this. And PayPal is setting up a new wallet that supports cryptocurrency.I still wouldn't choose to buy or sell through them. Their fees would be too high but they already have the user base, so people that thought twice a about buying btc before might not do so anymore.

Say that Bitcoin is the new way of doing transactions, much like paper money was when first introduced. At this point it can be looked at as a companion to FIAT money.
It's borderless currency, no need to convert to local currency if traveling or if buying online from another country. The conversion is already factored in the price of the product in BTC. So no fees.

Same here, people don't even know that you can buy parts of a bitcoin, they think you gotta buy a whole.If we use micro as denomination, people will feel better about buying 125 uBTC than 0.000125 BTC.My worry is, how will they feel about the transaction fees? Even when the fees will be lowered to 0.0001 BTC, that makes it 100 uBTC, which will "seem" rather expensive. People won't judge its value compared to the dollar or their local currency, but compared to BTC itself, namely uBTC

Hopefully you can answer me this: From what I understand, with electrum all I'll need is a master key and no matter what happens to my hard drive, I can always install electrum on a new hard drive and use that master key to find my addresses and my transactions, correct?
If so, does this master key feature depend on electrum existing as a service? what happens if electrum disappears tomorrow and I lose my cold storage, but I still have my key? I've been hesitant to use them because of this specifically and I haven't been able to get any answers from anyone.
Also, if I were to use Electrum, besides saving my master key somewhere, what else can I do? Would backing up my wallet be the same as with bitcoinQT? Meaning I gotta do it every 100 transactions?
Thanks :)

I'm invested because I believe in BTC as a payment tool. The more places I can pay in BTC, the more I will use BTC to buy stuff.
Bitcoin prices will soar to heights we didn't think possible and it will be accepted everywhere, though regulated. It'll keep being traded on exchanges and more businesses will have to adopt it, if not BTC, at least some other crypto-currency. Amazon coins? fail, possible iCoins? fail. PayPal-coin? bigger fail. Why? because they'll becentralized. There's a reason bitcoin rose in popularity.

I'm still totally lost. So if I'm running bitcoinqt, and want to back up my stuff, I thought all I had to do was create as many receiving addresses as I'll need, then do a backup. I won't need to backup again unless I create a new receiving address.Or so I thought. So now every 100 transactions I gotta backup my wallet? It'll be the same addresses, so what is the difference?

If America had their way, you really could see the FBI on a canuck's door. Good thing Canada is standing its ground so far.I'm referring to the cross border policing plan. Here's a few quotes:&gt; The so-called Next Generation policing project — whose pilots have yet to be finalized — would involve U.S. and Canadian officers working on each other’s turf to enforce the host country’s laws&gt;Traditionally, co-operative initiatives in cross-border law enforcement and border management have been based on the notion that the laws of the host country apply to illegal acts on its territory and that host-country courts would have jurisdiction, says the RCMP memo.“However, the U.S. has recently expressed concerns with the continued application of the ’host country law model’ and has requested that its officers be exempted from the laws or the jurisdiction of the ordinary courts in Canada in the context of the Next Gen and Preclearance initiatives.”Link for anyone interested:

Thanks for explaining, now it makes sense.
One more thing if you have the patience to elaborate on: again, if electrum stops existing as a service tomrrow, can I use this seed somewhere else to get the same addresses?
What if on top of electrum ceasing to exist as a service, there are no other deterministic wallet services out there, will I still be able to get my addresses?

Great news. They got Satoshi's name wrong though:
"Bitcoin has been called the world's "first decentralized digital currency" and was created in 2009 by a programmer using the alias, Satoshi Nakomoto."
Hopefully now we see an exchange come out of there.
Edit: Coinbase is not a full fledged exchange.

How about you keep that customer's btc in a special wallet without converting it to USD for however long your return period policy is? That way if the customer wants to return his item, you can then pay back the BTC owed.A better way would be to have a wallet just for returns. project the number of returns, and keep a certain amount of btc there that would possibly cover those returns, work some finance math. Make sure to get the BTCs for that "Returns wallet" as cheaply as possible. Keep using bitpay to process transactions and if someone wants to return that fridge, just take BTC from the "returns wallet" and give it back to them.I think initially, seeing as how you guys would be early merchant adopters of BTC, you'd be more than justified to also, on top of my suggestion, charge a certain % return fee until btc stops being so volatile, or until you guys figure out how to hedge using other coins like LTC.
@_date: 2014-03-19 04:20:52
Oh this is great. If they do expand to the US, Coinbase will have to add LTC to their books! To the moon!! lol
Edit: How does their wallet encryption work?
@_date: 2014-05-14 19:16:02
If banks won't work with them, then they need to be doing something about it, I understand that. There's no reason for them to ask for barrier to entry though. They suck, I can't wait for Vault of Satoshi to become more popular so I can start using them instead.

Update from Andy Booth: “Basically I got gox.com like any other LLL – didn’t directly target Mt Gox. My brother met domain broker Joe Politzer in Singapore who got excited about gox.com and then I said he could try to sell it if he wanted. He called Karpeles and Gox to find out if they wanted it and immediately they expressed pretty strong interest. I’ve asked Mark if it’s ok to publish details (no response as yet).” 
@_date: 2014-02-20 22:40:06
Tell that to the iSheeps
@_date: 2014-02-25 15:22:34
Right now you don't know which way the price is going. When mark makes a statement, you'll be at better odds of knowing, and if it's bad news people will try to take advantage of it by spreading fud again, and whales will try to push the price down. When it looks like price will go down, sell, then buy cheaper, maybe at $50 cheaper. However much the price will drop after the statement, unless there's more NEW non-gox bad news, expect it to go up over the next few days. If you can afford to wait a few more days.
Edit. If price doesn't budge, you wait a little as that'll mean gox news is already factored in and people will be able to move past this.
Edit 2: Nvm dude, that statement was just released and it's as vague as it can be. I liked the blank page better as a statement. The price will only go up from here

@_date: 2014-02-25 15:06:50
Wait a little longer, until mark releases his statement at least. I'm not so sure the gox story is fully priced in yet. My feeling is whales will try to push the price down once more as they did last night.
@_date: 2014-03-08 15:39:32
Why not tell the people about what's goin on? If issues were present since April 2013, why wasn't anything done about this? When mtgox just disappeared and everyone was trying to figure out why from the cryptic mtgox messages, what did the foundation do? Nothing that mattered
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:32:38
BTC will have to go through the motions but at least now everyone can work on repairing the damage done by MtGox.

The people of Canada decided that the loonie should be strong after the crash of 2008, compared to its neighbor, the us dollar. Canadian bank chose to devalue it, regardless of what the people/free market wanted. Good or not, that's beside my point, but don't think that currency value is not manipulated by governments.

So when we need more than 4 MB blocks, what do we do?
@_date: 2017-01-21 19:53:51
Wouldn't it be better to hard fork it to say 4mb, then using segregated witness to expand capability to 16 MB? From my understanding, Satoshi nakamoto didn't set the value of 1 MB with the intention of it being 80% of the maximum capacity of the "bridge".

Canada isn't. The government hasn't stepped in to regulate it. That's how banks move in and feel comfortable in the space. Until then, they'll be out and won't let anyone else in, cause if they can't play in it, neither can you with your money held in their accounts
@_date: 2013-12-06 04:32:01
You did the right thing, and never regret it. You should know that the world is much harsher and you will be disappointed, and maybe even mad at it when what you just sent around doesn't come back around. Be prepared for it, IF it ever happens to you.Good luck kid, stay positive. I would've returned the money too although I really need it, there's always someone who needs it more :-)

Ok, so minimize your losses by buying when it drops next and hold until $1500 price, then sell 1/3rd. See How the price Goes, next $200 increase sell again a certain amount. And so on and so forth. Bitcoin will hit $2000 in 6 months max
