I would like to submit my idea as a possible solution. The website that would benefit Bitcoin in general in my opinion would be very much like one of the popular social sites that most everyone uses today so that even someone knew to Bitcoin would feel at home on a social based site. The benefits of this site would be tremendous; an official site dedicated to bitcoins and Bitcoin news much like or bitcointalk. The ability for new users to come in and immerse themselves with Bitcoin related media that is held back from mainstream. To like or dislike posts/ideas, share things with others in their friends, and interact with everyone similar to real life. Just like in the real world everyone will argue over what to do etc., etc., and ultimately groups are formed. It happens in almost every social situation. The Core devs and authorized people are allowed to post to everyone so that everyone will be able to see and comment on the important updates no matter what group they are in. In the background analytics can be gathered from each user, like any social site does now and the subjects/items that everyone is concerned with can be posted on a public page. Voting can be on any and all matters to Bitcoin at that point. Analytics can track and map the votes of each user and group and submit all the information to the top devs and the voting numbers to the public listing all voters.
Anti-fraud Votes measures: With the addition of other commonly used spam filters such as social account verification and sms verification/ re-verification; Using multiple choice votes (like Yes No Maybe)Analytics can be used to compare all votes for each subject of each user(s) and groups, Comparing the results can determine if large numbers of fraud votes is occurring.
If the idea was useful to anyone please donate 1FZsypTGJhdE8kRzqfgTpvm6n1Djb28syL
