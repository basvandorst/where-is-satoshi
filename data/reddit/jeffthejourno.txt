You make a good point.  So the question is, how can Bitcoin solve that problem?  Expedia could hold the Bitcoins in escrow or something I suppose until you check in to the hotel.

What buys has google been making in the hospitality industry?

Their clientele also isn't known for being tech savvy either.  
The first natural use case for bitcoin will be all internet.  Only when everyone has bitcoins for making online purchases will it really start to penetrate the brick-and-mortar big box retailers.

As the value of Bitcoin increases, the comparative value of other currencies decrease, no?  They don't have to be totally replaced, just devalued, to make much of the population, those who don't own bitcoin, poorer.  At least that's how I understand it.
At the very least Bitcoin will mint a lot of new millionaires and billionaires who were in 1st world, high-tech areas (and thus were in a position to hear about bitcoin early).
Not to mention, if the value of Bitcoin increases 100x, Satoshi would become the richest person on Earth.

Actually Priceline is number one but it's still really big news for Bitcoin. It seems that adopting Bitcoin is increasingly being seen as a move the industry runner-up can make to revitalize their brand and get some media attention.  Not a bad thing at all.

You made some good points.  I'm not sure if I totally agree though.  When Microsoft's stock went up 65,000 percent it was because there was a huge increase in investment.  That many more people bought the stock.  And the people that were investing in Microsoft did so at the expense of putting their money into other investments/products/banks.  And some people withdrew money from other stocks to put into Microsoft's.  I think that it is possible to say that all other stocks were devalued *very very slightly* and together, they paid for Microsoft's rise in stock value.
The same is true more obviously with currencies.  When the value of gold goes up it means that the value of the other types of currencies has gone down.  When the value of the dollar goes down it means that gold and other currencies' values have gone up.
When Bitcoin's value goes up, it will mean that the value of other currencies has gone down.  People will demand Bitcoins instead of dollars and the value of the dollar will be decreased.  People will have a harder time using their dollars because buyers will be less inclined to take them.  They'll want Bitcoins.  Those people left with only dollars and no Bitcoins will find that the value of their savings has decreased.
I could very well be wrong though.  That's just my read on the situation.

Keep in mind though that Andreesen is as integrated with Silicon Valley as it gets and regardless of what you think of Snowden's motives, one of the effects has been the world eyeing American tech companies with suspicion and turning to local alternatives.
Personally, I think what Snowden did was heroic, but I suspect that Andreesen is weighing the damage that it did to American tech companies and basing his opinions on that.

Has anyone contacted Kickstarter and Indiegogo about accepting Bitcoins?  They seem like really natural partners and the combination would make it easy to avoid mishaps like this.

I agree with you about everything you said except I do think those who come late to bitcoin -- probably based on how far away from the high-tech world they are -- will end up poorer.

The success of a Bitcoin ETF will be a great window into the difference between how many people want to buy bitcoin *and feel technologically capable to do so* and how many want to buy bitcoin *but have no idea how and are scared to try*.  I'm guessing that's still true of a great many people.

True, that makes sense.
To be honest I'm not thinking of it from the perspective of me or you or anyone on here.  I'm thinking of how a normal person, how my parents for instance, will use bitcoin.  I would imagine they'd keep their coins in a coinbase account and would use 2FA but I'm not sure if they'd go further than that.  Maybe there should be a notice when you sign up for 2FA that you should also make your phone email or the phone itself password protected.
Actually the fact that your primary email is accessed so easily from your phone seems like a big security risk in general (not just for bitcoin).

I agree that's it a great goal, I just don't think it will happen for a while.
