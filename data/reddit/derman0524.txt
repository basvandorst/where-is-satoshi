I’m literally taking a shit trying not to move. My legs are numb, send halp
@_date: 2019-07-22 00:12:37
It’s probably the most legitimate one

It’s interesting how people with little money would even invest in bitcoin when they have no knowledge of it. You’d have better luck going to the casino since you already know your odds of winning and losing
@_date: 2019-11-23 22:25:06
I’d rather invest in a non volatile market like an index fund where investments and trends can be safely estimated. Bitcoin isn’t based on anything and is artificially inflated and deflated. Getting some money on bitcoin is purely luck with no investment skill. Getting money in an index fund that tracks the S&amp;P500 will almost guarantee you money at retirement but bitcoiners find that too boring

At least these coins have an actual worth

Why not just go to the casino and dump it all at the roulette table? You probably have a higher chance of succeeding

Is this why we see the huge spikes? Seems like a good way to make money of the sideways trading over the last few months
@_date: 2019-10-26 14:17:53
I sold 3 days ago lol. Amazing
@_date: 2019-10-21 16:17:15
So why is he still pushing to claim it’s him?
@_date: 2019-08-26 13:20:15
When seeing these huge short orders coming in, is it a good indicator to sell? What other technical indicators would pair nicely with this?
@_date: 2019-10-26 15:30:14
They can also freeze and close your bank accounts for using the banks credit cards to purchase bitcoin lol
@_date: 2019-10-21 10:34:07
How do we know he’s not Satoshi? I don’t know much about the subject either
@_date: 2019-06-25 18:29:26
It depends what you’re trying to do. Are you manually inputting the new price of BTC every time?
@_date: 2019-06-20 10:39:34
Why’s that?
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:28:21
Ya I use numbers as well. On numbers it’s limited as to what altcoins are available,
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:28:02
Okay I’ll give you -2 BTC. Pay up nibba
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:00:57
Happy birthday! Let me send you 2 BTC as a present
@_date: 2019-10-26 18:00:12
Ya but how many people earn BTC as a salary? A very small portion. 99% of people buy with their CC or direct deposit from their accounts. Good on you that you found a good system but others should be wary and not blindly do it

So if the price of bitcoin changes to $12K tomorrow, you’ll go in and change the price in your spreadsheet?
@_date: 2019-06-25 17:46:00
Why don’t you automate your spreadsheets so don’t have to do anything?
@_date: 2019-06-25 10:59:17
@_date: 2019-06-25 19:01:35
Look up online how to put in stocks in excel. The same function can be used for most major coins. 
So when you create the function, every time you open up the spreadsheet, the bitcoin price will automatically update for you so you don’t have to manually put it in. 
Off the top of my head you have to click a cell, type bitcoin, go to Data at the top of the page then click stocks and see if Excel will add it in. 
But if not, just a simple google search will help you out and next thing you know, you’ll have a completely automated crypto spreadsheet :)

I’m 90% sure they grabbed a random person off the street to do this presentation
@_date: 2019-06-20 09:53:22
Can someone explain to me how someone can be so sure that BTC will hit $1,000,000 by next year??
@_date: 2019-06-20 10:27:21
He insisted it’s mathematically impossible for it not to hit $1M. I don’t really understand it enough but I’m hear to learn. I made a little money off the Crypto last year but then the only good Canadian exchange went belly up early this year so I’m struggling to find a new good one
@_date: 2019-12-17 00:44:31
You’d have more luck gambling at the casino than reading btc lol

If the whole world collapses....nobody does?
