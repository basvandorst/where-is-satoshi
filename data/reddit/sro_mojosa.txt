What I'm not clear on is how you generate a payment code to be pasted / scanned in the first place for the purpose of creating a payment channel. Can anyone comment on this?

That's cool. My question was hypothetical. Good luck!

I agree with the solution to centralized exchanges being shutdown or subject to arbitrary powers is to use is to a decentralized exchange like [Bitsquare.io](
@_date: 2016-03-23 20:25:35
To be honest, I think that this will change the moment [OpenBazaar]( (or something like it) allows merchants to set up shop and specify payment in additional cryptocurrencies besides Bitcoin.

Miners have a financial incentive to accept translations because they're paid not only by the blockchain block reward but also through transaction fees. Once block rewards are no longer part of the equation miners will have an incentive to accept as many transactions as they can.
Right now fiat "gate keepers" are compelled to care about coin origin due to over-regulation in the market place. So, bitcoins gained by means that can be inferred to be illicit will be difficult to trade with on an over-regulated exchange.
Four things will quash this threat to free trade sooner or later:
* Increased development of privacy features on the block chain, such as [reusable payment codes]( in-wallet mixing, and privacy enhancing technologies such as Tor.
* P2P exchanges that are either in person (*e.g.,* [Mycelium local trader]( or entirely online that have no KYC and further obfuscate coin ownership.
* Competition from privacy focused cryptocurrencies such as [Monero]( that will push bitcoin to either evolve or move over for transactions that require privacy.
* By *loooong* standing Western legal tradition once money exits "illicit" territory (however this is defined) and enters general circulation it's as "good" as any other coin/dollar/whatever you own. So, eventually, even the taint analysis folks have to give up.

I agree with you, at least at present. I really like NuBits. I suspect we will see more asset-pegged coins in the near future.
Longer term though I strongly suspect most asset-pegged coins will end up migrating to Bitcoin side-chains specific to that purpose.

I'm curious, has there *ever* been a case where something was developed on Litecoin first and then the feature was implemented on the Bitcoin blockchain?

I tried BitShares back before the big upgrade and found the app extremely unstable. BitShares has a "walled garden" feel, perhaps because it seems [ShapeShift.io]( hasn't supported them post-upgrade. So, there is no easy on/off ramp anymore.

The OP's link is an implicit argument for censorship resistant commerce. It is, in effect, a use case for Bitcoin or other cryptocurrency.

This isn't unregulated finance.
It was the misnamed [Bank Secrecy Act of 1970]( that established many of the policies people on this thread are (rightly) pissed about.
The infamous $10,000 established in 1970 has, as I understand it, never been amended to account for ~~inflation~~ the continuous loss of spending power of the US dollar over time.
Pro Tip: You'd have to spend about $61,900 worth of 2016 dollars to exercise the same level of spending power.

Don't forget the mobile wallet [Mycelium]( has built in trading capabilities. Also &lt; is worth an honorable mention because it allows you to store *many* alt-coins in one HD wallet, including [NuBits]( which are pegged to the US dollar.

Interesting! I wonder if LibreOffice is going to add support for this any time soon.

It certainly could be. I'm just skeptical that the wider world has learned to trust Bitcoin / cryptocurrency enough for it to be an actual market.


I was covering both use cases: Bitcoin to Bitcoin and Bitcoin to USD transactions. You're right, buying something in USD from USD that was formerly BTC isn't a BTC transaction.


I certainly wouldn't.


Yeah, I read about that too.

Am I correct in understanding RBF is essentially, "Oh, nuts, I don't seem to have put enough of a transaction fee onto this spend... I'll append a larger transaction fee." Or...
Can you completely replace one spend with another to a different address just by adding a large free? Basically, "Oh, snap, I paid the wrong address... create a completely new spend with a larger fee to  the correct address.

* [Monero]( because of it's heavy use of one-time ring signatures. The there is a Wikipedia [article with more information]( It's mathematically provably anonymous.
* A competitor alt-coin, [Dash]( makes heavy use of coin mixing when transactions are sent.

How is this so? Perhaps it's time for another cup of coffee but I don't entirely follow.

That's *funny*.
@_date: 2017-05-12 20:17:34


That was never in doubt. What I mean is, there have been documented cases &amp;mdash; in the US at least &amp;mdash; where  cases have been *severely* hampered *this decade* by judges who had personally never used email and therefore could not understand how social media works... which is a problem if you're presiding over a cyber-stalking case for example. Email is fairly simple and social media is, by its nature, a much more complex system.
I don't think "lack of regulation" is the problem. There are already regulations that cover fraud. Bitcoin isn't so special it needs new laws on this front. The only place where I see it needing special treatment is if two people BOTH have a reasonable claim of ownership to the same private key. That's uncharted territory in my mind, because both "printouts " of the private key are legitimate.


Australians complain about that a lot. What's the deal?

There is a difference between protocol-level anonymity and the relative anonymity of your environment. You're right, if you're running [closed source untrusted code]( you could have exposure via a different vector, but that's not the protocol's problem.
[Linux]( users much less affected, [OpenBSD]( users likely not affected at all.

No kidding. The core problem here is that the judiciary in most countries amount to a gerontocracy. It's possible they've never used email, have no idea what twitter is, and all of this crypto currency business makes no sense to them such that it may as well be a lawsuit over bar tokens.

This sort of shenanigans will just accelerate the development of peer to peer concurrency exchanges like &lt;

If RIFFLE has any significant utility at all in increasing anonymity &amp;mdash; especially in the area of timing analysis &amp;mdash; I suspect that the methodology used by RIFFLE will simply be absorbed by a future version of Tor and/or [i2p](

In other news, EU Commission pretends that technology has not rendered it impotent and fundamentally obsolete.
Between Bitcoin mixers and HD wallets that make it difficult to re-use addresses, they're just not going to win this fight. Not to mention alt-coins that specialize in transaction privacy and anonymity like [Monero](

I get that one a lot too. That isn't a good analogy. In stocks, people buy "lots" of 100 units typically. The problem is, I think, people have the notion that BTC is not divisible below 1 BTC.

You misunderstand. Libertarian philosophy is about law and what should be lawful conduct. Libertarians take a dim view of coercion. This is because all law comes with an implied threat of violence or death if you resist compliance vigorously enough.
This is distinguished from what conduct is *moral*, *wise*, or *in good taste*. Conduct that transgresses morality, accepted wisdom, or social norms aught not, in the libertarian view, be penalized *by force of law.* Society is free to deal with these problems in different ways. This is why libertarians often confuse the hell out of traditional conservatives because they might, for example, be for legalization of voluntary prostitution but argue vigorously against it on moral or religious grounds.
Let us take your straw man attacks on the basis of race and what you call "gender." I assume you mean sex here, the two terms are often confused in modern English and so I'll go with that. If you meant something else, please let me know. The simple grammar rule is: "No matter how much I love my wife we will never have *genderal* intercourse."
In (some) Libertarian circles freedom of voluntary association is paramount. Therefore, a hypothetical baker could refuse service to anyone for any reason: color, religion, which warm orifice they prefer to park their private parts, anything. Now, what holds back "blind bigotry" from ruining free commerce are two major factors:
1. If a baker refuses enough people on the basis of too many arbitrary or immutable characteristics they will be harmed financially. There is an opportunity cost relationship between the baker's association preferences and his financial goals. If he's too exclusive, he could drive himself out of business this way.
2. The rest of society has a say. If our hypothetical baker puts up a sign that says, "if you voted for [some future controversial political figure] we don't want your business." The hypothetical baker can do that. But, the rest of society could decide that such a policy is a bridge too far and boycott the baker in question. Friends and associates could attempt to persuade him to amend his ways, etc. No law required.
You might think, "well, okay, but what about the discriminatory laws passed in the American South?" There is one thing that all law codes have in common, be it the Torah of Moses, the Code of Hammurabi, or the USC: you don't legislate against what isn't happening. Think about that for a while.
The problem here is that, while banks *should indeed* have the right to freely associate with clients as they wish regulators get in the way. The crypto-currency economy will continue to boom (with frequent bust cycles, no doubt) and grow to the point where the regulations are either powerless or irrelevant. 
Case and point, albeit by analogy: Once upon a time Netflix was controversial and the Blockbusters' of the world tried to stop it. Hell, Blockbuster proper was given a chance to *buy in* it declined. Netflix stands and Blockbuster no longer exists. That's exactly what I think crypto will do to traditional banking in the next 5-10 years. Some banks will still exist, but most bank functions will, to continue the analogy, go the way of Redbox and become kiosk driven even more than they already are with ATMs.
