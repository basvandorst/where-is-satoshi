You guys really showed who's boss with your wallet. Make sure you pay that $250,000 bounty fee.

Every legitimate exchange requires KYC verification, what so different about Shapeshift. Binances new US exchange that will be live soon will also require KYC, does that mean we should stay away from that exchange as well. At least Shapeshift is an honest, US based company and not some sketchy unknown Ponzi. Shapeshift is legitimate and with their new exchange you only trade with a hardware wallet so none of your funds are held by the exchange itself for extra security. If a exchange wants business in the US, they have to provide KYC, there's nothing wrong with that

The application or apps that I'm speaking of is not ledger apps but Google chrome applications that can be integrated with the wallet. You can also integrate many different 3rd party wallets like myetherwallet, bitgo, copay etc.. As for monero integration, bitfi can have that, who really uses monero anyway, that's a useless feature if u ask me unless your trying to wash money or any other illegal activities, that's all monero is good for. The transaction fees on monero are ridiculous too

First off, when the wallet launched they sold out the first batch, they had the wrong  backup on their website. It was suppose to be btknox.org but instead it said btnox.org which belongs to a random person. U can learn more here  So that "unhackable wallet" didn't exist. Fist red flag and that's a big one. Everyone's funds and private keys were exposed. Not only that but how many phishing sites will be made. 
The ledger blue can be used with app integrations, currently their are 9 apps available for it. Bitfi doesn t have app integration. It's a wallet only, that's it. Frankly everyone is buying the bitfi only because John McAfee name is tied to it, the problem is that guy does so much drugs he is making big mistakes like putting the wrong backup website btnox.org and didn't realize it until the video was issued. But hey if that's what you prefer then that's your opinion, to each there own.

It depends what the user is looking for. Bitfi is a wallet and that's it. The ledger blue is a wallet plus so much more. It also runs on its own OS.

Hello Bitfi,
I understand that when the your Bitfi  put the wrong private key retrieval website (btnox.org) and should have been (btknox.org), none of the users funds or private keys were stolen. I also understand the device doesn't store the private keys on the device as most hardware wallets don't. However the owner of btnox.org website either being nice enough as he inform you guys of the issue or wasn't tech savvy enough to do any harm. If this wasn't the case and the owner had other intentions he most certainly could have created btnox.org to become a phishing site and then retrieved any of the users private keys. So it sounds like you guys got really lucky as this would have ended your company instantly. 
When you say the bitfi device is the only device that does not store private keys well that's just not true. If not all, most of the  hardware wallets available online today do not store private keys as users are required to write them down when the device is first activated or I  guess they could memorize them like what u claim bitfi wallet holders do which is really difficult considering most of these keys are usually 12-15 random words and/or numbers.
Now when you say the Bitfi is a "powerful computing device", what exactly van it do besides send and recieve bitcoin, monero, and maybe ethereum transactions? Isn't it essentially just a undetachable  SD card with a user interface?

Why do you say that? They are being used by hundreds of people everyday, mainly though wallet app integration. Either way that's easy money.

It's risk free because you practice with pretend money. Why don't you research before you coment
