...time to file civil suit...

This is just this last week.  It falls 40% *in one week.*
Got it yet?

It's taxable at Every Single point of sale at the value the cryptocurrency would have relative to fiat currency.
You guys are very bad at this...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:30:02
You're missing the Yet.
@_date: 2017-12-27 04:18:36
And you can keep failing to comprehend the difference between net and gross and why the difference between them is not taxable.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:34:32
Wall Street wants to suck value out of anything and everything where there is a dollar to be made, and they just did it with bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:54:25
You seem to have a fundamental misunderstanding of money here...
@_date: 2017-12-22 18:20:34
No matter how long you hold on, once it's worthless, it's worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:25
Both accounts are correct.  The idiots are those who think it's a joke comparison.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:01:27
It's completely inexcusable because this is how you get regulations including regulation that outright bans the use of cryptocurrency altogether.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:36:49
Hey, you'll look back and say "I did not lose my money to BitCoin."
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:40:18
It always comes back around in the end.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:41:19
If you buy a home, don't forget to consider the property tax!!
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:45:17
No matter what the market is, there's always a good deal to be had if you have the money to pounce on it.  It's just harder to find the good deals in a bull market.  It's like Bitcoin right now, it's a bad market to get into, right now, but a couple months/years ago, it was the place to be.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:03:43
It's not the rules so much as the taxes... ;)
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:53:43
And this is what will KILL Bitcoin and all the other alt digi-currencies.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:56:12
If people treated Bitcoin like is was a fiat currency, then it might actually have some sort of meaning right now.  Bitcoin is now a stock in a gambling match.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:25:33
This is called appropriate legislation closing a loophole.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:07:36
Too much volatility in this market...
@_date: 2017-12-26 11:09:48
Your reply has got to be a joke, please tell my your reply is a joke, OH MY GOD YOU'RE NOT KIDDING????
INVESTMENT [PRINCIPLE] IS NOT THE SAME AS PROFIT [INTEREST]!!!!!!
The INVESTMENT in A, B, C, AND D is $10,000 and $10,000 respectively, THIS DOES NOT CHANGE UNLESS THEY ADD MORE PRINCIPLE, NO MATTER WHERE THE PRICE [PRINCIPLE +INTEREST] GOES.  A, B, C, D, All $10,000 Investment!
In A, the profit is 0.  
In B, the Profit for Investor A is $990,000, and Investor B has an investment of $10,000 and a profit of 0.  
In C, Investor A has now realized a profit of $1,990,000 on his investment of $10,000, while Investor B has realized a profit of $10,000.  
In D, Investor A has realized a profit of 1,790,000 while still retaining 100% of his investment; he has lost 10% of his profits and lost 0% of his investment.  Investor B has realized a profit of $8,000, while retaining 100% of his investment; he has lost 20% of his profits.
At NO POINT in your example have either investor lost their investment.  They have both lost profits, but not their investment.  Furthermore, A has lost more profits valuewise, but as a percentage of his overall gains, he has lost less than Investor B.
We'll use smaller numbers with realistic increases.  We further only need to consider ONE investor.
Investor A puts down a principle of $100.  His Investment goes up 10%; he now has his $100 Investment and $10 in Profits.  Different columns of the ledger!
The price incurs a negative interest, going down $1.  Investor A now has $109, having lost %10 of his PROFITS while still retaining 100% of his PRINCIPLE.
The asset hits another rough patch and goes to $90.  At this point the Investor has lost $10% of his principle and has Zero Profit.  If there was a bump up from $100 and it is now below $90, then he has lost 100% of his profits, no matter how much they were, while also losing 10% of his Investment.  
If his investment started at $100 and then immediately declined to $90, he never had any profit to start with, so there is a loss of 0% profit and 10% investment.  
The only point at which the percent of investment lost matches the percent of profit lost is if the investor puts in an amount, it goes up [no matter how much], and then goes down to $0.  At this point, investor A has lost 100% of his investment AND 100% of his profits.
Now let's consider this scenario:






You bought your 1 bitcoin at $100 and it went up to $1000.  They bought 1 bitcoin at $1000 and then the price went down to $500.  At this point, You have lost $500, or 50% of your profit, while retaining 100% of your investment.  They have lost %50 of their investment and realized 0% in profits because it never went up.  If it had gone up, though, persay $1001, then they have lost 100% of their profits while you lost $501, or 49.9% of your profits.
BIIIIIIIIIIG Difference between a loss of Investment and a Loss of Profit.  HUUUUUUUUUUUUUGE Difference.
The only Voodoo here is your messed up ledger.  Come back after you learn some god damn accounting principles!
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:14:55
The reason we have the fed and all the rules that coinbase users hate is precisely because there are those who will be unscrupulous...
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:21:13
You really don't get long term trends, do you?
Bitcoin ran up over ten thousand points in the last two months.
People were buying bitcoin purely out of speculation.  Now they're cashing in on their investment.
Are you going to get caught holding the bag?
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:22:56
It may hit 10K by new years... :P
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:53:17
Fiat money, as much as you might view it with distaste, is for the better part stable.  It does not rise Or fall in value by more than a couple percent each day or each month.
Bitcoin has risen in value by thousands of a percent each month for the last year.  What more, Bitcoin is backed by Nothing.  Nothing at all. This is not a stable currency, and it is actually far worse than any paper fiat currency that might exist.  When this bubble bursts, expect sanctions of digital currency by the FCC that makes is all but illegal to use.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:44
The US can make them illegal, though, including doing business with them.
@_date: 2017-12-22 13:55:53
Yes, as stable as a Fiat South American Currency, Aha...
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:30:56
You need to simply shut up because you're continuing to show your failure of comprehension.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:10:02
Bingo.  Followed by a crash, or worse, a horde of people going to BBB and every government security entity in the country trying to get their money back, leading to legislation that shuts all coins down altogether.
@_date: 2017-12-27 03:27:54
You really are an idiot.  Seriously, quit trying to explain that for which you repeatedly demonstrate a complete lack of understanding.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:32:13
There's no guarantee the price will ever recover.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:34:17
As soon as people figure out that they can't cash out, in large numbers, that's when it crashes BIG time.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:26:12
Any time you buy or sell ONE cryptocurrency, you are making a transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:35:00
You lost 10% of your profits.
They lost 10% of their investment.
BIIIIIG Difference.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:27:44
Yes.  But No.
If they fail their short, then it can bite them, but if the short succeeds, then they just took a couple billion from the little people who made Bitcoin big.
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:33:53
YES!  You got it!!  Any time you exchange one currency for another, you still pay taxes.  There are people who play the currency markets, where they trade Yen for Won and Won for Pounds and Pounds for Euro just like people are trading Dollars for Bitcoins.
@_date: 2017-12-19 13:08:15
Yes, by ending Bitcoin.  That's how this will eventually play out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:19:18
My point is that it's the slope that matters, not the current value. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:50:06
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:47:08
It's called a business loan, they're made all the time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 12:06:36
It's this simple: try to get your money back out.
If you can, things will stay great.
When you can't, that's when the markets start crashing because people can't get their money back out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:35:09
I dare say this is what might get the FCC involved in such a manner that it all gets shut down.  This and the fact that BitCoin Breaks International Currency Transfer laws.  You can't just take more than $10,000 out of the country, and yet, with BitCoin, that's exactly what you can do.
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:55:07
Right.  But if you declare it, there's other rules that follow.
Bitcoin circumvents all of this.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:02:08
That's what you think...behavior suggests otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:56:02
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:36:14
That's a special level of delusion...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:29:02
And that's the beginning of the crash...
If you can't get your money back out, it's a sham.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:09:54


Except people are treating it exactly like a stock.  You can say it's one thing, but you have to call it by how it is actually behaving.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:32:34
But what did you buy at, and how much?  You got a good chunk, that's how it works...
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:24:56
It's a serious question.
If the bank cannot pay out the cash, then the asset becomes worth what it pays out for.
There's a point where no matter what the bitcoin is "worth," there's no cash to back it up.  Nobody wants it at that point because it's worthless.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:30:18
You made the right move. ;)
@_date: 2017-12-22 11:00:50
You're only looking at the B Value.
You need to look at the A Value.
Considering equation Y=AX+B
If it loses 3.5k in the next week, it might hit 10k by new years.
@_date: 2017-12-22 12:17:55
You mean as Capital Gains.
@_date: 2017-12-07 15:33:38
And yet the people buying it, the people BUYING it, are treating it like a stock.
So now it is a stock.
You don't get to decide what something is.  The Market does.  And right now, this market is treating Bitcoin like a Stock.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:29:32
Very bad idea.  If you sell currency 1 and it's exchanged value is $2 per coin, and you buy currency 2 and it's exchanged value is $1 per coin, then you owe taxes on BOTH sales if you make any money from the change of value for either currency while you hold it.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:32:36
A little late but yes.
@_date: 2017-12-22 07:31:46
The new tax bill includes taxation of cryptocurrency.  So the banks found a way to get into bitcoin fast, run it up, and now they're selling off before Trump signs the tax bill.  The Banks you hate just made Billions in fiat currency by treating your cryptocurrency as an investment vehicle like stock and not currency.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:03:49
Nobody cares about bitcoin except the making money from nothing.
@_date: 2017-12-19 11:40:25
Ask Weinstein how that went...
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:05:01
That's like any stock...
@_date: 2018-08-09 14:50:23
The Euro.
Get the fuck out.
@_date: 2018-08-09 13:18:01
Yes, the average person doesn't give a shit about bitcoin or the principle behind bitcoin.
The miners are in it just for the money.
Most people are in it for the speculation.
You're better off with tulip bulbs
@_date: 2018-08-09 12:54:06
Bitcoin may be done...A currency must have a stable value.  This is not a currency.  You're better off buying and selling tulip bulbs.
@_date: 2017-09-22 18:31:06
They want a bubble to pop, so they can then buy it up themselves on the cheap after it being proven to be a valid investment commodity.
@_date: 2017-09-07 18:07:23
Deflation, your income becomes physically less and less, but your debts remain the same.
Inflation, your income increases but it becomes worth less and less, but then so to does your debt become worth less, especially if you don't add to it.
@_date: 2017-10-14 03:20:37
Oh, but it did really happen.  What kind of revisionist history are you prescribing to???
@_date: 2017-10-13 10:26:10
Yes, and in the 1600s tulips were a wild new currency in  Holland...same issue, same end result.  Only here, you have something that doesn't exist, and is only worth something because people say it is worth something.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:13:43
You have a fundamental misunderstanding of money.
Currency is only worth what people think it is worth.
If they only think it is valuable for buying and selling, it's worth nothing as a currency.
Something does not have to be understood to work.
If it requires an explanation to get how it works in order to then work, it's fake from the start.
@_date: 2018-12-17 16:14:29
The issue is that the people who want to see Bitcoin used as a daily currency fail to comprehend how junk investment vehicles work.
