I'm interested to see what this thing can do, but I kinda consider the amount of RAM still a bottleneck for any serious use
If anyone has any benchmarks or something, please share :3

We gaan voor uw zoon, mijzelf en alle andere 36 duizend VWO scholieren bidden dat ze bij CITO over hun hart strijken en met een beetje een aardige [N-term]( over de balk komen ;) In ieder geval bedankt!

Yes, it is a nationwide exam, for the 6th and final year of VWO (highschool before going to university, for more detail see [here]( It's comparible to the final British GSCE A-level tests. The nationwide board is called CITO (*central instiution for exam development*). Your final grade for each subject is 50% all marks you got at school for that subject, and 50% the mark you got at this final test, which is nationwide, and taken at the exact same time and date. Half an hour later the exam, as well as the answers are published online by CITO.
It is pretty interesting to see though, that an actual government organisation puts a text about bitcoin in such an important test.

That would be CITO. De instelling wordt steeds minder populair onder jongeren wegens het gebrek aan nietjes in de examens en het van-de-pot-gerukt-lastige Nederlands examen van afgelopen donderdag.

Just took that exam. Was a pretty nice surprise, all the texts were the boring usual socioeconomical crap, and then suddenly a nice piece about bitcoin. Cheered me up quite a bit, these are the dutch pre-university exams after all. Whole exam was an easy A* (~9 voor de Nederlanders).
