Not even close. Cambodian GDP per capita is over $1,200. It isn't a lifetime of money for anyone on Earth

You need to have money in the first place to benefit from tax write-offs.

Hey everyone, I know nothing about bitcoin, but I do know that is a horrible article. It is actually fraud. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 04:35:25
What made you see it as an investment in the first place? You are essentially buying nothing. 
@_date: 2018-04-01 04:57:08
Why?

It is a lifetime supply of toilet paper at a huge discount.

Do you realize that ZERO is the destination? Just a question of when.

Hopefully it is like me and my baseball card collection. If you are young and didn't put too much in then it is a nice lesson for when the next "bitcoin" comes around.

And if you held onto that computer today, it would be a nice obsolete antique.

I recommend you take out whatever is left and spend it on hookers and your drug of choice. 
@_date: 2018-04-07 05:30:22
Forget the hookers and drugs recommendation. Here is my new tip. Download the movie Boiler Room. Wait till you see the character Harry Reynard. YOU ARE HARRY. Ask yourself where you got the brilliant idea to "invest" in bitcoin.

No they certainly aren't.

This Sub is pure entertainment for me.  I used to collect baseball cards as a kid thinking I'd get rich. Lots of money spent, zero profit. That is exactly what is happening here. Some people make money in promoting it, facilitating transactions, or pretending to be an expert, but most people will just lose whatever they put in.
