Solid article from 1 month ago ... 
@_date: 2018-01-30 21:54:35
There is a ton of confusion with **Market Cap vs. Inflow** and it just goes to show half of you all do not know what you are talking about. . . The argument of Tether being at 2.2 Billion and BTC being at $170 Billion couldn't be more wrong. **That doesn't mean there is $170 Billion invested in BTC it is more like there is $12 Billion in BTC and if Tether has a 1:1 ratio that means $2.2 Billion could take the market into a plunge** some of you all really need to understand investments .... Read this article it will help you out

Buy a ton of BTC now and pump up the price then when futures are released sell all your bitcoin and short at the same time. It’s a win/win because you know it’s going down. You make tons of money. It’s called a naked short. It is what happening now and people are just being foolish with the BTC price.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:42:52
Lol what do you mean risky? It’s literally the opposite of risk. BTC market is so easy to manipulate now if you have a large bank role. You sell on one market and short once released on CME on the other. You get gains going up and double the gains going down. It’s guaranteed profit with literally no risk. Read up on it, there are a lot of articles posted about the big short fear and futures being released.

Damnnn I am following this closely ... could see a possible dip? I don't think they will "ban" because they came out to correct themselves the other day saying that BUT they can impose some serious regulations which could spiral a long Bear run .... 50/50 chance this is good/bad news. Guess we will find out in states when we wake up. Nothing more we can do.

1. This is exactly what I been saying. How is Bitcoin Cash $400+? Where does the market cap come from? If it split from Bitcoin wouldn't the Market cap of bitcoin fall proportionally to the split of the new coins price? 
2. You can't just make a coin and not have any investments and say it is $400+and let people withdraw...that money has to come from somewhere...something adding up, where does this money come from??
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:02:25
Yeah idk if I'm explaining myself well....what I am trying to say is the original value of bcash comes from splitting off of bitcoin. So during the initial split the market cap of bitcoin should have went down to allocate the price of bcash. Yet, bitcoin didn't go down and bcash is over $300 right now meaning the original market cap pool is greater then before the split (not include individuals who bought into bcash after the split).
@_date: 2017-08-03 22:44:33
Still it doesn't make sense because bitcoin market cap never went down yet you can sell bitcoin cash for 400+ right now....that money has to come from somewhere...it is almost as if everyone decided to sell Bitcoin right now at the current price there is not enough money to go around because the market cap is not accurate. Everyone can say one bitcoin = 1 million dollars but there has to be money to back the bitcoin
@_date: 2018-06-15 15:24:59
Yeah but if that initial 1 billion USDT that was used for $57 billion worth of volume has no value to begin with ... that would be detrimental to the entire cryptocurrency ecosystem.

I know 5W PR was the team Bitfinex &amp; Tether hired ... they made tons of false accounts on Reddit &amp; Twitter. It is pretty well known they had a huge fallen out [ .... There are tons of shelf accounts that are 5 years old with no post and then all the sudden start comment and shilling altcoins. Tron might have been the most obvious one.
@_date: 2018-06-13 16:42:07
Um yeah Bitfinex paid a PR team to make false accounts and so did most alt coins
@_date: 2018-06-13 23:21:28
Yes I agree, movement of this size is to scare people or it is going to really hurt if they actually sell around 30m worth! I'm am keeping a close eye.
@_date: 2018-06-05 21:53:23
Of course no discussion here ... ppl just want to ignore the red flags and pretend like everything's okay. Great post OP
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:57:55
Idk I am torn...I’m not sure if I am thinking of everything way too much. Everything seems so good to be true. I haven’t slept in like 2 days. Up all night thinking if I made a dumb move or not.
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:37:55
I agree, I am sitting on the sidelines for now and waiting. Rather let the waters cool before I get back in. If it does pop, or when it does, it will be a bloodbath. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 01:30:53
So basically like a 1,200% increase in a single year isn’t going to the moon? This could be the “moon” you are referring too and soon will short. It’s easy for a big hedge firm to unload BTC they been collecting for the past year and short at the same time. The SEC wouldn’t even blink an eye for a firm to take a huge short position. They can justify it by saying “oh it was a speculative market, easy play for us!” 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:40:09
I agree with this ... read up on some rumors regarding BCH pump and when BTC goes on CME the shorts will kill the price and then will stay at the same price more or less with less volatility and no gains to be made.
@_date: 2017-11-27 19:04:27
Yeah I totally agree with you. My investment has turned into something too big to let ride for me. Think leaving some I am comfortable with losing and banking the other is probably the right course of action....I am reading every article and literally getting obsessive at this point. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 22:07:49
I agree, anyone who says they know what is going to happen is kidding themselves. Bitcoin is so unpredictable and I just feel like things are too good to be true right now. People are acting like BTC won and only care about what the price is right now but not actually the bigger picture of the entire cryptocurrency community. I been in the community for awhile now and never been so nervous to protect my money. New people coming in only care about immediate gains and not what is actually happening. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 16:26:39
lol you are right . . . point taken; you knew what I meant though
@_date: 2018-02-18 19:18:37
It was an exchange consolidation ... doing your research before posting pointless illumanti type discussions. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 14:07:11
Oh it happened in the past, so it is going to happen now! Stop trying to use any excuse to hodl. In the end the ones who hodl are the ones who have been in the space for awhile, care about the technology and the social impact of bitcoin .... BTC will keep falling, if all you care about is gains, pull out now cause it will continue to get even worst. 
@_date: 2018-02-05 16:05:45
Couldn't agree more!
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:19:28
and there was no fundamental change from $200 to $1000 to $5000 to $19,000 ... don't kid yourself with that nonsense
@_date: 2018-02-07 04:31:25
I was agreeing with you that no fundamentals have changed in years; yet there was a huge price increase in 2017. I agree everything is psychological at this point. People refresh cryptomarketcap every second, looking at the price. Few care about the technology and to be honest it is hard to care more about the technology when you are accumulating a crazy amount of gains. This explains why there is no fundamental change in bitcoin yet the prices are going down. All psychological. Perfect dead cat bounce today. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 23:05:06
It means they can short the sh*t out of BTC futures
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:19:42
Say what you want about Jordan Belfort but he hit the nail on the head with one major point. **The regulations that were proposed yesterday by the SEC are NOT GOOD for the entire cryptocurrency market**. 
I listened yesterday to the entire meeting and was like oh crap, they are coming after the cryptocurrency market, this is not good .... then I come onto reddit and there are tons of post *Crypto-Dads to the Rescue!* ... Um no, that just shows a lack of understanding. 
Yes, you need regulations to expand acceptance however, the regulations that were proposed by the SEC will destroyed the cryptocurrency ecosystem. Blockchain technology in real organizations like Visa will survive. BTC and other cryptocurrencies will die with harsh regulations by the SEC. We cannot allow this. BTC did not set out to work with and be controlled by the government, and that is exactly what is going to happen. 
I been in this space for awhile now and I really do not understand the disconnect right now. It is almost as people are looking for any excuse to not sell at this point, not even understanding basic fundamentals...And yes, I know what I am talking about I am a license attorney in corporate business.

I was suppose to convert a decent amount of LTC to BTC this week but IDK if I can now .... BTC is just looking so good. I say $1600 could show by EOW and $2000 could show by EOM. 
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:04:57
I mean anymore context besides it's a scam coin? I am legitimately asking and not trying to pick a fight. It seems like LTC has Segwit, cheap transactions, pretty much a clone of BTC with some improvements...How would it be a scam? Seriously, looking for insight here and not just scam, pump and dump comments?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:34:53
 .... why do you hate Litecoin? Wouldn't this being a very plausible answer?
@_date: 2017-05-22 02:32:07
Why would it hurt litecoin?
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:22:35
Honestly, there is this irrational fear of Litecoin. Why split up Bitcoin, why destroy a good thing. Let Litecoin be the scaling solution and leave poor Bitcoin alone!
@_date: 2017-07-26 11:33:08
I don't understand? Why wouldn't ethereums price just come crashing down?
@_date: 2017-05-01 18:16:54
that escalated quickly :) 
@_date: 2017-07-27 22:01:16
Yeah but that means you are risking all your BTC holdings for free BCC which future price is most likely manipulated and will be worth nothing in the coming months .... any split will cause a drop in BTC and you can just buy cheap BTC during a big dip. Or if you truly believe in BCC buy it after everyone dumps it because it seems like everyone has the same plan. . . **Someone correct me if I am wrong and why this thinking is wrong**
@_date: 2017-07-26 14:29:37
ETH boom was because of ICO's now there will be limited ICO and not have USA investors? Would this negatively effect ETH?
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:52:47
Damn hostile crowd here - I know 100 BTC doesn't equal 100K and I know the split isn't 50/50. I was simple explaining where the market cap of BCC is coming from and you don't magically just get free BCC in your account and your BTC is worth the same as before...if you did, everyone would just load up on BTC now then and hope for the best for both chains.
@_date: 2017-07-26 01:28:30
This is even worst, they are basically putting all exchanges on notice. Once one exchange gets a letter from the SEC they will pull ETH off the exchanges and it will be hell ... if there was no Hack I bet you outcomes would have been different!
@_date: 2017-07-27 12:01:20
1. Well the market will split so if you have 100 BTC worth say 100K, when the market splits you will now have 100 BTC and 100 BCC but your BTC are now worth 50K and your BCC is worth 50K. 
2. So basically if everyone dumps BCC (which everyone is talking about) you will have to try to dump your BCC to buy more BTC or take the risk and hold both BTC and BCC. The potential for a lost is high. 
3. Think the best option is to convert in fiat on an exchange/coinbase or hold in LTC, then wait for exchanges/coinbase to reopen trading with BTC and then buy BTC cheap at half the price! 
4. You can even hold and wait longer and see which is the surging chain and not take such a big risk buying in again but then of course BTC will have risen in value by then.
5. If it was truly free BCC and free money wouldn't everyone and their mother buy BTC now and wait for the split LOL that's not how it works, the value has to come from somewhere and that value is coming from half your BTC.
