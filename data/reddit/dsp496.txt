Here are about 48 items to consider. Each can lend a different value. But most work out on the low side to estimate 7 or 8 figures.

Ok I uploaded to different service. was not clear they were going to do that.
There is not a whole lot of code to this idea. Im just going to throw this out there and then parse the block chain for each pixel value. Each block will be a frame in an animation. See what happens.
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:15:10
This is shit advice. If this is your first day in bitcoin you definitely need to buy atleast one Bitcoin, or no lambo for you! Do the the math.

Just got the site up. :)
@_date: 2018-01-22 10:04:54
That was allot of work. Now you can see what I was thinking. Click a pixel to see the addresses. It will sync with the block chain using block trail.

Thats what the turkey said the day before thanksgiving! :)

I did. I think they might be blocking it. Mabey the mods dont think it is such a hot idea.

Here is an example transaction I just did. It cost more than I thought coinbase has a 0.00001000 minimum. So I sent 0.000012555.

Im going to build a viewer in javascript. Idea is its not really tied to a website. Each address is like a 1 byte memory location.
@_date: 2018-01-20 17:24:46
Ok I will see what I can do On github. I guess it is confusing but it can be mediated by software pretty easy. My thought was you could do one value if you just want a monochrome image. For the block parser my though was it keys off the last transaction to the pixel/address as that would allow me to convert it into a video as each the block height is really a frame. So animation would be possible.

Im with you on Decentralisation. I would like to see us compete and break bcash. On Paypal For you and me that is true. But paypal is only available in 19 countries. Andreas said this is about the other 6 billion. The resistance to any block increase makes it unuseable precisely where it is needed most. This would be like saying that facebook should have a $100 sign up fee. Higher prices equal lower demand. The block reward suplements the miners in the meantime. You really think a 4mb block would break bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-12-24 17:34:46
Ok so here is a question that is out of my league to fully understand, but what if you used parallel chains in some type of federated setup, and allow transactions to be replayed, to each other or forked. The weaker chain has less hash power but confirms smaller transactions.

I have seen that video. Roger needs anger managment. I guess Im with you I feel like Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin the dev's are key. I am a libertarian so bitcoin to me is a big FU to all the coruption. Solves the double spend problem. (and if you think about it thats all the banks are double tripple spend problems)
But why why why cant we compete. I rember a post where satoshi was getting into a debate about the level of security in a blockchain and he shut it down by saying its not about perfection. Its "Good Enough". I kinda am asking why cant a 4MB block be good enough decentralization.

Bitcoin futures are a oxymoron as it is always available. Why exctaly do you need bitcoin tomarrow at x price but not today. It is deliverable in 10 minutes. The question is only of price. The issuance and supply is known.
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:15:13
Im not saying it will not be Worthless. Just worth less than bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:04:49
I think I want to cast my vote on BCH and sell it. But the issue I have is their is some merit to the argument.
The price run up tells you their is some belief there. Even if it is not massive volumn allot of us have not acted. As a group we could drive that price to zero.
Transaction Fees seem high. Solutions seem weak.
Personal Story: The other day my son was pestering me for some bitcoin as the mania has everyones attention, so I logged into coinbase to buy a few bits and found what was basicly dust before turned in to about a pay day of $ (had not been in for a long time) so I gave him $50. To spend on steam games. The price was all over hell so he started speculating about waiting to spend. Good lesson I thought. lol :)
But here is the rub he got burned for a $10 Fee on a $15 game and steam disabled the day after. He is 10 and annoyed as am I. What do I tell him wait 2 years and this lightning thing will all work out and we can use this. Or This is a store of wealth. It kinda became usless to him at the time he got it. I kinda feel as though this was not what I signed up for.
You all told me I can spend bitcoin for minimal fees and teleport money around the world at an instant. The big market was going to be remittances.
I get keeping the blocksize small has merit too but how is it that it can't keep pace with moore's law? Seems to me we are due for atleast some kind of increase if only to take the bite out of bcash.
I also see other guys Like Erik Voorhees, and Bruce Fenton Posting similar sentiment on twitter.
Richard Heart makes a hell of an argument about what a piece of shit bcash is.
But the reality is you can buy 1TB for $99. These days.
Im no shill either I have been following bitcoin since the little squirl from Night at the Roxbury was pumping it and got screwed by mybitcoin. lol dwolla --&gt; mtgox etc.

TL;DR The big short is the Dollar and Bitcoin is the fuckin put option. 
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:50:26
The dollar bubble, the gold bubble, the bond bubble should pop too..... at some point. I think money or anything like money functions different, as it is desired for reasons other than would be objectivly reasonable. Its like telling people not to play the lotto because of the odds. The reality of the situation dosent apply. and if you were right it would not be where it is now. No one using any normal method can explain why bitcoin is worth more than one cent.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:27:14
The price is information that allot of people disagree with you and have put their money where there mouth is. Short term who knows. Long term it is a black hole. in my view pop means zero, correction sure but still in the scope of things it dont matter. If your day trading bit coin you would need your head examined anyway.
@_date: 2019-05-20 22:32:37
Holding USD is gambling too at this point in time.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:35:30
Monies are the only bubbles that dont pop. The demand is all of the worlds desires. The supply will never be able to meet it. A key point is this is not IBM stock, that you would have to convert. (Your already in the more liquid asset.) I cant think of a sinlge reason why I would prefer dollars on a apples to apples basis. Time is the only factor, each day more time passes and more trust gained.
@_date: 2017-06-10 19:04:40
Then explain over the long haul why people would desire to hold Dollars over Bitcoin. Once your really start to make some money you will see. Its a shitty variable measuring stick. I think you have not figured out that you have it backwards. In reality Bitcoin recently devalued the dollars you hold the stock market and bonds by 65%. There is no reason that this will not continue. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:15:46
Maybe gold's value has been manipulated and supressed by $70T from a fractional reserve bank ponzi in that case BTC could go up 500X while gold goes up at the same time. 
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:31:29
There is Artificial demand for dollars VIA the tax racket. Ill remind you contracts use to have a Gold Clause. As Bitcoin dominates the savings of the world and skyrockets the fact that someone will accept Dollars will be amazing. Even if bitcoin users were nothing more than a group colluding to loan each other Dollars at zero interest when needed it still works out. 
@_date: 2017-06-22 12:06:23
Actually thats exctaly how it works. The difference is bitcoin is considerably better in a few ways. Over time if it survives it certainly will over take gold. Understanding the differance between value and price is how you get rich!
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:16:59
I get it Gresham's law is a supply side theory. Now if a small but productive group demand Bitcoin, or a Large unproductive group lol.......
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:52:38
I my defence, we dont know how much gold there really is and we dont know how many keys people actualy have. I think the ratio is higher.
@_date: 2017-06-11 04:03:33
I think first mover advantage will still win out. They also have zero winklevii, and no AA.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:41:55
What if people reject the fiat and demand real money. I have read some stories that this is happening venezuela.
@_date: 2017-06-10 18:54:01
Its just a list I have come up with as to why I hold it. I really only need one good reason.
@_date: 2017-06-22 11:54:47
Lets Compare how gold acts like a decentralized ledger. Hmmm. Easy to calculate the balance by counting or weighing. Check out the limited supply, its also easy to divide and authenicate. Transactions well for that you can mail it or bring it with you. If only there was a way to do the same thing digitally.
