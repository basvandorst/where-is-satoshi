Whatever they do crypto is here to stay. And they aren't killing off bitcoin. The developers and spokespersons for bitcoin are very very established.
@_date: 2017-12-10 06:27:15
This helps. No one wants to mess with capital gain taxes anyway lol
@_date: 2017-12-11 07:13:45
this is quite literally what i suspected people to be doing as the hodl. thank you for the post just confirms my assumption
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:51:30
Lol so you're saying your as positive of the wall street hand not affecting the bitcoin price negatively as the sun going out? Think about that. Like. Take your hand off the keyboard. Walk around the block. And think. 
I'm hodling bitcoin and rooting for it as well. But I'm stupid enough to think me rooting for it stupidly is gonna somehow make the price go up. Jeez man, you're the kind of guy that cries and goes on month long benders when his sports team loses lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 20:25:17
IF IFFFFF IFFFFFFFFF lol
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:49:06

@_date: 2017-12-10 06:27:53
Lol 
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:29:10
hodling is not torture when price dips....
thats when true hodlers go, "daaaayyyyyummmmmm huge sale babyyyy!"
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:22:19
Oh I don't day trade. Ever. I hodl. I bought 20k when it was 3.7k to around 6.5k. Didn't have a clue what I was doing but week by week things became clearer.
You can clearly see I still have a ways to go but I'm pretty happy with my investment. And I feel safe with my trezor in my bank safebox.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:52:21
I'm assuming day traders keep the money in the exchanges though. So how does that work? They never would xfer to a bank everyday would They?  This is all so fascinating
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:27:24
Ohhhhhhh !!! That makes so much sense
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:48:20
i do now lol. so shouldn't the major push be with BTFD in the title instead of these hodl memes?
@_date: 2017-12-14 05:49:46
in america we'd call him a doosh
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:28:04
So how do you keep track of your taxes
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:59:46
Yea that's the general consensus I'm getting from the level headed crowd in here
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:48:48
yea about 5 seconds after i posted 10 dm's told me im an idiot for not knowing lol thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-10 20:02:14
Human behavior has a few area where it's almost 75% predictable. This is the area in which we can manipulate others with. Propaganda, advertising, general crowd behavior. It's not 100% but it's definitely been studied enough to make an impact and have proof it works. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 14:01:05
if nothing is predictable not even somewhat why buy in or hold? if theres truly 0 indication of rise or fall its seems silly to do anything
@_date: 2017-12-22 15:17:35
It's an acronym for hold on for dear life
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:51:27
cant you also hold but buy and sell as you predict to increase holdings?
i mean if one is taking a risk on long term, makes sense they could also take a risk on guessing the dips.  its just an educated gamblers way; to take risk that is.
so lets say hypothetical enthusiast bought 10 btc at 3k. and lets say 10 years from now that 10btc is now worth 100k each. Great! it worked! he has now increased his capital from 30k usd to 1 million usd.
but if he guesses and bets on dips and rebounds as well...
then hypothetically he buys 10 btc at 3k
sells at 7k
buys back at 5k
sells at 18k
buys back at 15k.
etc. now he has 13 btc in 10 years and has made an increase of 300,000 usd from simply holding.
now both of these scenarios are obviously over simplified and assuming everything goes right, but my initial surprise was at the absolute vitriol behind the posts condemning people selling.
"get out."
"good riddance"
... i just didnt understand why they would automatically suspect it was fear selling and not calculated gambling. Plus if you want to grow a community and have all types of people from nervous nancys to hardcore hodlers, you dont typically act as disgustingly as a lot of the posts i saw.  It helps to have both. so if these posters were truly serious about increasing BTC as a worldwide everyman's product, it baffled me why they would act in a counter intuitive way.
there are some comments here in the thread, where cool headed hodlers have explained to me that timing the market is difficult.  And I agree.   Some other points made were really good too, however I dont think its too far fetched to believe a lot of people buy and sell during (somewhat) predictable dips.
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:26:14
So I'm not better at literally anything bitcoin trade related. I am however extremely curious and keen and human behavior. Psych  major in college 10 years on the job yada yada... So that's why It surprised me and I asked the question. I think it was taken by some people as "haha I'm smarter than you." But I don't know enough to day trade and never was even thinking of coming across as condescending on a trading point. 
Condescending as a human interactions point? Yes. But never on trading. Anyone that sees my thread history on btc can see I'm an utter noon that got lucky and came in at the right time.
@_date: 2018-05-08 23:42:21
i mean even if gates is anti bitcoin, i cant hate the man.. sorry the guy who single handedly wiped out malaria from 95% of Africa in a single lifetime? not to mention the work he's doing with clean water
yea you can hate me for all i care, you a good dude mr gates.
@_date: 2019-11-16 06:07:20
Lol I used to think this way. Then I started watching bustabit. Those mfers go through 2 bitcoins swings ina day or two its nuts
@_date: 2018-06-25 00:39:13
Yea. I get op is upset because crypto prices are down but the notion that bill gates is not a freaking amazing human being doing amazing philanthropic things in the world is one of the most assanine things ive ever read
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:00:25
Welp I do have money. And I am asking. A guy with money is supposed to know everything about everything?  Is there some rule on this sub that says middle class and below only? If you don't want to help just downvote and click on. 
Same thing happened to me when I asked how to buy. Some guy goes on some tirade about how I'd lose money if I didnt properly research. Welp. I just made enough for a car because other kind redditors helped. And I'm looking for help again. Because with every angry guy or girl like you there's 10 people who want to grow the bitcoin community and the cornerstone of that is information. 
I don't go on Google or other sites. If I did I wouldnt sub to Reddit and r/bitcoin. But I prefer this community to other sites
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:42:03
Yea :) I'll buy back after the 15th but with not knowing as much I figured to take the small win for now
@_date: 2017-11-02 07:39:20
I bought 20,000 at 3700 to 4200. Then another 15000 at 4600. Just dumped it all at 6900ish all of these numbers are ish. I don't happen to have an accountant. Does it make a difference since it's over 10k? Or still a simple add on ? Can someone with experience pm me. Thanks
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:18:28
Why thank you I'll check it out.
@_date: 2017-11-02 08:07:24
When you buy on gdax I found you can set limits and terms on when you want to buy. Generally what you do is set a price it's currently at then partition out the rest of your buy at lower amounts.
For instance I bought 5k at 3700 then had to wait for the following week because of the 5k limit on gdax. (I didn't want to pay extra fees by rushing a higher amount, something I learned on reddit) then when the rest of my money was transferred to gdax I was able to set prices I was willing to buy at 2k intervals totalling up to the following 15k.  Hope that explains things. Even though you've been nothing but rude and condescending, I actually can answer your question so I will. Since that is what I hope people will do for me as well. 
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:50:37
Good point
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:50:30
It's a days til my initial 5k hits so I have no choice. I hope it goes sub 2.5 that'd be so amazing
@_date: 2017-09-15 09:06:39
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:56:55
well thats very stand up of you. but you really dont have any part of you that hopes it stays low so you can buy? i definitely agree theres a line you have to draw in the sand but any time you play any market when you win someone is losing and to not want to win is... well why invest then?
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:55:16
nooooooo no bounce.. stay down til tuesday... good bitcoin.. lol im kidding here of course. im in for the long haul 
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:41:23
O_O oh i thought you had to have a go between. someone said coinbase had ridiculous fees and you need to buy on gdax xfer to someother site then remove
@_date: 2017-09-15 07:51:03
I don't think it'll ever hit sub 2. But I just got in the game what the hell do I know lol

No. It's only going to rise more and more so... just keep it if in 10 days it's not where you want it to be.  If you spent money you need to survive, take out what you need, eat the loss but know you'll probably make it back as the rest of the amount continues to climb. Also never invest with money you need for life. Or even backup money. Investing with bc is often done with play money unless you are extremely confident or ballsy
@_date: 2018-07-24 23:43:59
you sound smarter than the op.
