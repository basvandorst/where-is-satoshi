Is that your sentiment? 
I feel like this is some really good perspective here. 
Crypto as a whole will easily get to the gold level in the next 10 years easy. 
This is like getting the opportunity to invest in instant pancake mix or bottled water. 
Most said it was a crazy idea but in the end, most who played won.

Will check this out. Have been blocked recently and can't buy crypto unless I go to the crypto ATM and that has shit rates. 
I have another direction to take but it's going to take a week for the card to show up.

Leveraged trading begins at 1. If you 100x leverage you essentially have a 100 dollar contract for 1 dollar. 
The amount listed would be the lot size, so he may have done 1.19 mil devided by xleverage = actual amount he staked. 
Most positions this size are running on 50-100x leverage. 
Say the user has 20 btc total. He then puts 10 up for 100k x 10x leverage. He then has a million dollar position and can breathe +- 100k
When btc is on the move by 200 usd plus or minus, hit bitmex and watch a couple hundred million in spots get liquidated. Either way this isn't that big. 
As btc continues to grow we will see much larger positions getting liquidated!

After a quick goggle It seems I'm talking out of my ass 
2.2 The face value of a BTC contract is USD100 and the prices in the order book is aggregated to USD0.01. The face values of LTC and other tokens contracts are USD10 and the prices in the order book are aggregated to USD0.001.
Straight from Okex. 
And max leverage with them is 20x so the user could have risked a minimum of 6 million. 
Poor bugger.. probably a private fund, not a single user.

Could ya please maybe look at the details.. it's a contract for 1.19 million not 119 million. 
This shit is being spread all over the internet.. 
(119 000 000= 119 million) 
(1 190 000= 1.19 million) 
 
Not hard kiddos. 
1 contract = 1 usd 
1190000 contracts at 1 dollar ======???

Why do Canadians make it seem like it's difficult to purchase bitcoin (btc)
Every province has several banks that are not the big 4. Open an account with them -20 minutes, email transfer funds from your regular account to this new one and voila, head to one of the 3 large Canadian btc sites and purchase in moments. 
Heck I'm with royal bank and can purchase with credit card and debit card with no issue, what is everybody talking about. You must be payed shills trying to create fud. 
My friend that uses cibc confirmed that he cannot buy btc from quadriga and my btc. Perhaps try switching to rbc or if you have loblaws they have their own banking system and I highly doubt they would block anybody from anything (banking is not their priority) so the more the better for them.
