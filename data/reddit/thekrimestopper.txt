We're in a bear market. What do you expect? Gotta trade sideways for awhile before we see an uprise. Hopefully the market is settling but like always, it's anyone's guess.

I've watched this sub for a couple months and it's just as toxic as others. The mods love memes as much as the users of the sub.

I appreciate the insight. Few and far between. Having any analytical look at the market, you need to account for a 80% downturn. I bought in August and I'll still lose 75% of my investment with a crash. 
Being positive, I hope 10k is the floor for any major correction in the future but you have to plan for the worst. That's why you don't invest more than you can lose.

TLDR: if you don't like memes your not a serious BTC investor. Thanks for the insight.

If your asking random people on the internet on how to spend 4k?
@_date: 2017-12-08 21:43:39
In one week there's been a 5k increase. How is that a dip?

Make a gdax account. It'll be linked to your coinbase. You can sell and buy as much as you want.

Agreed. Memes are fun but it's getting out of hand, every few days there's so many shit posts on the front page. I like the sub for news and opinions.

Market can't sustain this crazy increase. If anything, seriously, be happy it's going down slowly for a few days instead of a panic selloff to sub 10k.

If you have an old smartphone, load your 2fa on that one and use it for your log ins. If you lose your regular phone, you don't have to worry about your 2fa being compromised.
Even if someone compromised your exchange and email password and took control of your phone, they still can't log in with the 2fa on your disconnected phone.

So sick of this 'war' mentality. It's quite nice not paying attention to this sub. More people should try it. Gives you a better piece of mind.

Best indicators we can look at right now is the price not sliding. After a huge dump we had last weekend, last thing you want is for the price to slide and adjust to another bottom. (5k) 
I'm happy as hell the market has stabilized today and hopefully it'll stay at this level (6.4k to 6.8k) for the next week and hopefully start inching up again. 
Futures are coming (hopefully) within the next month. 
Lets hope that'll spur some buying. 
I'm not an economist but I just hope that with the futures coming online that people don't short it right away and sell their holdings for another fucking cash grab. (Hypothetical situation, not creating FUD.)
Hopefully with the futures we can see a consistent uptick in value and less roller coasters. It would be nice to see 10k by the end of the year but if it hits 8k, I'll be happy and everyone who bought and held will make some money. 
Have a beer and take a break. It's nice not having to peer at my phone every hour and resetting my alarms for dips.

It's generally a bad idea to try to time the market. If you want to buy in, buy in. 
is betting on a correction which does happen sometimes when hitting all time highs.
Personally, the market has been very bullish lately and I doubt we'll see a correction. Everything has been smooth the past week. Hitting 10k is a psychological barrier. I'm willing to bet it's going to stay where it's at for a few days or push higher. If your up around 11pm - 2 am eastern, you'll see Japan/Taiwan/China waking up to the news and if there is going to be any pull, down or up, that's when it'll happen. 
No one knows what's going to happen. Best advice is, if your want in, get in now, don't wait. Good luck.

Don't invest more than your willing to lose. No one knows for sure what's going to happen long term. Long term, invest in stocks, index funds ect. 
This is pure speculation, you can make a lot of money or lose it all. Good luck.

No matter what people say, since there has never been something like this in economics, no one knows what's going to happen. 
It can range from bitcoin being worth nothing tomorrow to revolutionizing the way we use money. 
It's speculation, not investing. 
There is a lot of people who have a positive outlook about the future of bitcoin in the sub but in the end, no one knows what's going to happen.  
If your going to put money in it, just understand you can lose it or make a lot of money.

Already showing resistance. Don't worry.

"Bitcoin Cash market is heavily concentrated in South Korea, with three major South Korean trading platforms accounting for around 53 percent of Bitcoin Cash trading.
The rest of the trading volumes are composed of Bitcoin Cash-to-USD trades, not Bitcoin-to-Bitcoin Cash trades. Thus, it is too early to claim that bitcoin users frustrated with high fees are moving to Bitcoin Cash."
I bought more last night when it hit a mid range support level. Should have figured it was going to drop to $6,200 this morning but I can't read the future.

It's first in first out so if you bought BTC and exchanged for another coin a month later, you have to pay capital gains. I ended up buying at$3400 and selling at $5600 and buying back in at $5700. I had to pay the gains on $2200 from the buy back. Talk to your tax accountant. Last thing I need is to be audited and have to pay back taxes.
