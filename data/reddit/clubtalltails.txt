I'm curious though. If BTC is a decentralized peer-to-peer owned "currency" and we exchange our BTC for USD, what would the taxes we're supposed to pay? I didn't think there was a tax for exchanging currencies, just a nominal fee for the transaction.

Ignore all the neigh Sayers. This is amazing. Hopefully he learns the most important lesson from this. Enjoy being a kid for as long as possible. Because "There's never enough time to do all the nothing you want."

It's a skirt if they're wearing something underneath. Until we know for sure, its a kilt.

That's the plan. Nothing lasts forever. Number 4 of the Ferengi rules of acquisition states: Sex and profits never last long enough. 
I have a set number, that when it reaches it, I will cash out. It won't be enough to fix everything, but I'm hoping it's enough to make the needed changes to get the state to award me custody of my daughter.

So yeah, a bridge to nowhere.

I'm legitimately crying right now...
If it keeps going like this...
I have no where near a full Bitcoin, but I have quite a bit of satoshi, and 55,000 on the way from a couple faucets...but if it keeps going? This will save my life...

I got into Bitcoin and other cryptos back in 2015. It was a case of "instinct and opportunity" for me at the time. I only have about .003 but that went from a dollar to 50 almost overnight. I never thought it'd boom like it has this quickly, only thinking maybe a few bucks.

Those Bitcoin Cash people? Send them my way. I have a bridge I want to sell them.
