There isn't enough market cap in bitcoin to be considered a MAJOR position (as you put it) in terms of the whole government's balance sheet

news has very little correlation to the price

True but it is still range bound.

Number of economists in the world making predictions and how many time frames we are looking at. If one economist made one prediction in eight years, there would be a 12.5% chance of being right (1/8=12.5%), assuming a crash happens every 8 years.  For him to get 2 predictions right it would be a 1.5% chance(12.5%\*12.5%=1.5%).  So if we have lets say 5,000 economists guessing in the same way 75 of them would be right strictly by chance (5000x1.5%).  The other 4,925 were either right or wrong because they knew or didn't know what they were talking about.  It sounds like to me that luck is a very small part of being correct.

You could also explore the ocean floor or nearby celestial bodies if you really made that a life goal.

Do you really think he was trying to fool anyone?

The ones who consistently make correct predictions probably have some knowledge about what causes a crash, wouldn't you think? There is a chance that some would do it by luck if you have enough of them, but if you consider how many variables there are such as predicting a time frame and a reason for a crash, and doing it many times means that you would have a less than 1% chance of it happening by chance.  You can calculate the probabilities for me if you want or I will do it if you have some data for me.

Recession or crash is what I meant. They tend to happen every 7-9 years.  It's the boom and bust cycle.

Yeah, they are always predicting recessions so eventually someone is right.  If one can predict 2 or 3 recessions (without making wrong predictions) then you can listen to them.  We are overdue for a crash though, they tend to happen every 7 years or something like that.

It's a lot smaller too so that should be expected.  Is it still cheaper on a per dollar basis?
@_date: 2018-08-17 02:51:54
Buy more and it's more exciting.  But if it gets too exciting you will make bad decisions.
@_date: 2018-08-17 02:48:09
It's fixin to run up big time.
@_date: 2018-08-17 02:50:18
Probably good to sell about half when the price goes way up and seems to be topping out so you can do that again later.

just buy a little at a time over several months, or try to buy when the price is at a bottom and everyone is saying its going to zero etc. we have a little further down to go most likely. 10% up or down is just another day for crypto
@_date: 2019-10-23 14:48:36
It just does that from the trading. There doesn't need to be a news story behind it.

The newest version of a revolutionary technology often has its flaws that make people think it is a bad invention.  But they don't realize those flaws can be fixed.

@_date: 2019-02-09 20:33:36
I guess the key would be in determining if the flaws are fixable or an inherent part of the technology itself.  I think most problems in general can be overcome.

I don't know. Maybe some of them are realizing they can't stop it so they need to start buying.

The price is low now. It's not the time to be selling.
@_date: 2018-11-15 21:11:17
Now is the time to buy if anything but we may be going down a little more first.

He is analyzing on a small time frame, in which case there would be lots of noise not useful for trading.  Long term analysis is a lot more meaningful.  Short term traders don't need to know if the price will go up or down next. They just need to have an idea of when a break in either direction will occur and place a buy order that only fills when a certain price is hit as the price is going up.

I'm not sure what kind of "progress growth" you are talking about but I'm going to assume stock prices.  If you adjust stock prices for inflation, the progress growth you are talking about is probably about the same as it was when the dollar was backed by gold.  Inflation is really a way for the fed to take purchasing power away from anyone holding USD.  The stock prices may have gone up, but they aren't actually worth as much more as you think because they are measured in dollars that are decreasing in purchasing power.

When wages stay flat for a long time the little guy is definitely hurt and pushed into poverty.  The rich know better than to hoard lots of cash and buy appreciating assets.

Couldn't they have just blocked access to certain sites that they don't like instead of the whole internet?

After you have enough money saved up to cover 6 months of living expenses, pay off any non-house debt you have, then when you have no debt, invest any extra money you have (beyond 6 months of savings).  you can invest first but remember that is risky and paying off debt is guaranteed savings

Crypto will benefit government as much as it benefits everyone else.  All the rich people who own congress like fast cheap transactions so they won't ban it.  It will probably save the country when fiat becomes worthless due to hyperinflation so it really is in their best interest to not ban crypto.
@_date: 2018-12-01 05:43:37
hoping the price goes down a bit more so i can buy more!
