Lol good point. I guess I was saying that as it is all just a fun mental exercise the number itself is more important in relation to what you can afford. 
Stack your SATs too! You can also look at in the Satoshi value rather than dollars. If you can get 8-9 BTC now while the price is cheap you can add about 0.5 BTC to your stash annually via interest with crypto .com , Celsius, blockfi 
I've got some great referrals for free Bitcoin, message me if interested, the bot mod removed my reply earlier.
Stack your SATS ☺️

Depends on the future price. If 1 BTC is going to 10 Million then the answer is 1. If BTC is going to 2 Million then maybe 1-2? 
All depends on what you need in retirement.
I personally would like to have 5+
Just HODL a percentage of your wealth and possibly be rewarded.
No financial advice, but a fun mental exercise.
Happy New year everyone.

The only thing predictable is that it is unpredictable short term. Long term looking at it's life it's very predictable; it goes up.

In my experience credit cards consider buying crypto a cash advance and charge astronomical rates of interest (20+% I found out the hard way, but immediately paid the balance off when I realized my mistake)
