thank you for the tip. I checked his website and didnt see any properties from Caesarea. my experience is that tel aviv agents dont want properties from Caesarea. they concentrate on greater tel aviv area.

I checked the link but couldnt find any property in Israel. to be frank I dont think it makes sense to advertise there. thanks

its not the wealth it is bitcoin......meh
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:32:39
why should I lose 50%???
lets ask Andreas Antonopoulos or Toni Gallippi if I will lose 50% I am sure Toni could make the deal happen without a big loss. and a small loss? yes I am willing to accept it because thats my btc payment to make history.

lol Israel is the most secure place if You mention ISIS and terror. believe me I know it and enjoy it. take a look what is happening in european countries like france, belgium, UK and germany.
but lets stay on topic but we can open another thread to discuss it
@_date: 2014-11-29 15:01:57
yes it has :) even a filter against gas and bio weapons 
@_date: 2014-10-29 06:56:45
I understand your point but as I love the bitcoin idea I would like to sell it in bitcoin and we make btc history. why not :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 20:58:00
thank You for pointing this out. I see You know the area :)
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:47:50
lol thanks for the question. pity you are not a buyer so I would invite you. or are you by chance in Israel?
if You understand hebrew please let me know, because I was interviewed in Israel tv because I offer my proprty for btc :)
sure you could still say how do anyone know that it is me. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 17:47:59
thanks for the question. if You would be the buyer it would easy :)
if You have a buyer You are the middle man You will be sure to get the fee.
any property contract will be done by a notary and this will be payday for You and me. 
lets take a real estate agent, how is he assured to get his fee? with  a contract and after the contract between buyer and seller.
but if You or anyone else has a better idea please let me know. I dont want to cheat anyone I just want to sell my property for btc and make history :)
IMO seller , buyer and middleman will make btc history in case we succeed to sell the property for btc 
@_date: 2014-11-01 14:37:52
IMO most will agree with You but I am still looking for a customer :)
@_date: 2014-10-31 09:34:33
it is not worth the time and effort to explain it to outsiders living abroad. they just dont know how it is in Israel.
@_date: 2014-10-29 08:07:06
IMO bitcoin will be here when we are all gone. the question is the price?
no one can predict it........
@_date: 2014-10-30 06:18:56
WRONG....if I introduce You to the deal I would tape the conversation or keep the mail conversation etc :)
and proof it later to me the seller and that should be enough to get the finders fee. I like it fair play.

not all because I have to pay the mortgage back with fiat. but I will think about it again because you are right.
@_date: 2014-10-29 06:15:14
agree but bitpremier is much better IMO. but thanks for trying to help
@_date: 2015-05-23 17:10:01
hi, any customers for a property in Israel?
@_date: 2014-10-29 18:26:09
it would be nice if You stop this discussion here and open a new thread f it is so important for you. lets meet in your new thread  
@_date: 2015-01-30 08:45:22
I didnt sell yet but they sold a few as I know and the owner and team are very helpful. good luck
@_date: 2015-01-30 07:16:16
