Backstory: did a fireside chat with Jason Calacanis in NYC, event was [here]( It was to promote his book [Without Their Permission]( I got to go to it and participate in the Q&amp;A and then meet him at the book signing.
Ohanian is one of my favorite entrepreneurs for
1. recognizing that the crowd can value content [better than any panel of curators]( and making this site
2. making it open source and realizing there weren't going to be reddit clones popping up everywhere to ruin him
3. being one of the only tech entrepreneurs to consistently speak out on things like internet privacy, SOPA, etc
4. recognizing that entrepreneurship and philanthropy aren't mutually exclusive
So today he gave an interview about all that stuff, which I guess will be [here]( at some point. I got to ask a question at the Q&amp;A, and then I bought his book and got to meet him. He asked what subreddits I was into, so I said He said he's "cautiously optimistic" about it, especially since the SR bust barely made a dent in the overall ecosystem. He pointed out that Coinbase traffic didn't take much of a hit after the bust, the price wasn't really impacted, etc. It wasn't until after I left that I saw how he signed my book, which was awesome.
It was really unexpected how far into "tech startup nerd overload" territory the whole thing went. Honestly, I think the way he sees some things is way way ahead of its time, and the world hasn't realized it yet. He's a cool dude and it really made my day.
