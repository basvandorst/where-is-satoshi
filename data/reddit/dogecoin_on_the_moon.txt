No I'm talking about cost of x procedure in Japan vs cost of x procedure in the USA not who is paying for it and how.
Or maybe I should coax it out, Can you tell me the cost of a bed for the night in a US hospital vs a japanese hospital and if one is more expensive than the other where is the value being lost.

Since 200,000 was in day one I would like to see how that tapers off and what it is currently.
Sorry to be bearish but I think this is another "seeking PR" release from the CEO

US healthcare got so expensive BECAUSE of the private nature of it if you ask me.
I mean if I'm a doctor and I have life saving skills you will pay whatever I ask for them if you really need it right? 
The most efficiant healthcare systems in the world are all "socialist" Hong Kong/Singapore/Japan.

Look I know what you are saying and for the most part I agree but I'll also say it doesn't take the govnerment to run a cartel. 
To some certain extent the US healthcare system is preying on the hopes and prayers of the sick and must only be second to weddings in the rip off opportunitys it offers. 
If you look around the world govnerment healthcare offers better value for money with the slight trade off being that it tends to inovate less

As an Irish Shibe trying to promote bitcoin to my family this christmas it's great to see an article in one of the most well ready daily papers to prove it's not just me talking about this new currency
