Not true. If you receive a SW transaction, and you've not upgraded yet, then you cannot spend the coins until you upgrade. Explain that to end-users... That's why SW would need at least a 6-12 month activation period.

It's the liquidity of exchanges that prevents big moves, not the market cap.
Let's say I own all bitcoins, and I bought the last piece for $1M. So the market cap would be circa $12T, and there would be no more sellers.
As I now own all bitcoins in existence, no one would want to possess it anymore, so there are no more buyers. Market cap is still $12T, but markets have dried out. There's no liquidity at all.
Then suddenly someone come and says "you know what? I'll buy your entire stash for $12M". I'm bored of my game so I give in and sell all 12M coins for $12M. Despite the previously huge market cap, bitcoin price goes straight to $1 (and market cap to $12M).
This is oversimplifying of course (as there was no mining in this model etc.) but the point is that if there's crowds waiting to buy and sell (ie. deep order books) it's way harder to move the price. If it's a game between few market participants only, you'll be able to create massive booms and busts.
Try visualizing what happens to the order book when a market order happens. That's what moves the price. The order book doesn't care about the absolute $ value of orders.

Bitcoin is just starting to take off in Hungary. We have drinkups twice a week, with new people constantly showing up. We just launched the country's first ATM with great success, with all major media outlets covering the story and 90% positive.
We also have many Bitcoin startups, with one of them -- Bits Of Proof -- already through its exit (sold to Cointerra).
My personal experience is that we are on the verge of mainstream adoption, with non-techie laymen taking interest, installing wallets, buying coins, spending them, etc.
There is a very active community with great minds who want to see this work and who are concentrating on making things happen, even if it doesn't bring personal profit short term. In fact, most of the people I know spend more money on getting the word out than making anything out of it.
This is a good sign and I'm optimistic on our country's future adoption and ecosystem growth.

I think the least important aspect of Bitcoin is the price of its natural currency.
We never endorse buying bitcoins for speculative purposes.
In the past few years, the Hungarian press was always about big booms and busts. Our first ATM (launched 3 weeks ago) was the first story in the history of Bitcoin where the Hungarian press focused on that stuff that matters. "Drug money", "pyramid scheme" and "highly volatile speculative instrument" seems to be a thing of the past now. I really welcome this shift of focus from the press.
If someone would ask me why they should buy bitcoins I would say "Buy a little, not more than you could afford to lose - and buy it simply to own a piece of history."
Of course if you need it to settle debt - then buy more, and transfer it. That's what it is for.
The most important questions to ask are: "how many transactions are we handling? how many people buy stuff for bitcoins? how many people will buy stuff for bitcoin tomorrow?"

1) I haven't devoted enough time to POS / DPOS / etc. to be able to meaningfully answer this question. Generally I support experimenting with new aspiring methods for securing the network.
2) If someone brings something new to the table - why not? Let people build truly revolutionary amendments to the Bitcoin protocol and let them speak about that. That's for the greater good. In contrast, if a conference organizer cannot find enough quality speakers and they fill their tracks with altcoin pitches that do not bring any significant improvement - that's another story. You wouldn't attend that conference anyway.
3) Cannot speak about that - never been to Middel East unfortunately. Would love to get there some time.
@_date: 2014-09-22 20:11:34
As Ron and Meni pointed out, we're not so much involved in the technical aspect of the Bitcoin protocol. The Bitcoin Foundation does more work related to this field.
I also have my personal view on this. I think Bitcoin itself  (and at this stage) is, by design, more of an RTGS than any other thing. It's most widely use case is:
1) a final store of value - Bitcoin has intrinsic value, and is not a substitute or IOU for anything, and as such is a perfect reserve currency;
2) and a payment network related to (1).
This is how we use it right now. Its properties are of a very well designed RTGS (
Imagine TARGET2 or FedWire on steroids, with no central control and a clean, fully transparent free-market reserve currency. It is suitable for gross settlement of funds, between merchants, banks, business partners. It is less suitable in its current state for massive amounts of super fast real-time micro payments (and by micro I mean your beer or restaurant or grocery bill).
I love paying for my daily lunch with bitcoin at Anker Klub in Budapest, but in its current state Bitcoin is absolutely unsuitable for everyone to do that. The only reason I can do this is that the Bitcoin network processes a very low amount of transactions per second.
We could make this work in a more real-time fashion; raising the block size (with certain things taken into account), implementing inverse lookup bloom tables or whatever else may help.
I am usually in favor of diverse currencies and payment systems. Money has many properties and you cannot have a one size fits all global supercurrency. You need to focus on problems you want to solve, and solving global problems are different from local ones. A global and a local money would be usually mutually exclusive, but complementary in their design. I really like Bernard Lietaer's view on this (
To sum it up, I think Bitcoin in its current form (and probably the next 5 years) is more suited for a global real-time settlement network. A super secured chain of truth that practically no one can challenge. That's great for settling millions of dollars, quasi-realtime. There's no other tool to do this now.
But to pay for my beer (or HFT trading of commodities), I see off chain transactions, side chains, Open Transactions and related ideas to be more suited. Then at the end of the day (or even every 10 minutes) - Open Transactions servers (or Ripple / Stellar gateways, or anything else that'll come up) can do a gross settlement between themselves using the Bitcoin blockchain.
You always have to focus on the problem that needs to be solved. Netting lots of small value restaurant bills with trusted customers need entirely different money and payment properties than settling millions of dollars with global trade partners who potentially don't trust eachother.
Great things will come out of dev teams starting to get really focused on pain points. We need to think and focus: What are we trying to solve? How do we best achieve that?

1) Free market forces :) and that could mean anything. If you're into trading I suggest you to start with the following 3 books: (read them many times)
- [Reminiscences of a Stock Operator](
- [A Random Walk Down Wall Street](
- [Trading in the Zone](
Also anything by Andre Kostolany. You will get great insight on how the markets work.
You'll always have small fish and big players. Big players will use their power to profit, will try to manipulate as much as possible. If you're small, try to stay out of the big player's frequency. Usually big players manipulate markets shorter term. Try a mid to long term strategy. Don't get overwhelmed by short term price swings. This is a huge topic and these are very general recommendations, but still worth to ponder on. Develop a profitable strategy, then stick to it. Then change it.
My own pension strategy: buy bitcoins from 10% of my monthly personal income and do not care about its price. End of strategy. (I am saying this after 3 years of profitable FX daytrading and algo trading).
2) I don't think Bitcoin will end wars. Bitcoin is neutral, and can be used for any good or bad purpose. It depends on us -- how we fit Bitcoin into our lives. Ending wars is more closely related to human discipline and evolution. Until we can't reach equilibrium in our mental and emotional lives, we won't be able to reach an equilibrium of forces in the outside world. Until there's no equilibrium, there will be wars. Tying Bitcoin to world peace is a fluffy and cute concept, but realistically it won't help us humans defeat our inner greed, anger, envy or lazyness. A blessing of unicorns popping out of the Sun may as well bring world peace. :)

95% of miner's revenue comes from coinbase transactions.
Bitcoin's price is directly tied to its utility. The more utility, the more people use it. The more people use it, the higher the price.
Thus your revenues as miner is directly tied to utility and userbase.
Would a miner optimize for 5% of his revenue (by limiting blocksize and utility) or would he optimize for 95% of his revenue by keeping Bitcoin's utility by letting more users in (and thus increasing Bitcoin's price).
Simple high school maths and economics.
@_date: 2014-09-22 21:13:12
Without being an expert in game theory, I see that Bitcoin has a very good balance of powers. I trust our core developers and I also trust the miners' choice on protocol votes. It worked great so far. Devs and miners already showed many times that they are able to react quickly to disasters and come up with a consensus that's for the benefit of everyone.
As Meni pointed out, at the end of the day it is the people giving value to Bitcoin who vote, not the miners.
This is a very delicate balance of powers and expectations, and the real genius of this creature called Bitcoin is being able to orchestrate all this by itself, through computer code and fanatical believers, without really existing as a tangible "organization".

When will LN be usable in reality, for everyday purchases? What do you think, what's your estimate?
72 hours (and transactions possibly timing out and getting discarded from the mempool is also very common) IS how Bitcoin works nowadays.
Try to run an ATM, an exchange, or any service based on Bitcoin, and you'll see what the new reality is.
Here's something to read: 
We run an ATM and an exchange and experience the exact same issues.
And no, higher fees don't solve this, because tomorrow someone will come and outprice you. And then again.
What blows my mind is why we can't do a little stress relief before getting to LN?
By the time we get to LN, other chains will eat Bitcoin's userbase. And those people will probably never come back.
Back to my original questions:
- when do you think LN will be ready, so my Mom could buy dinner with it at the restaurant? (this includes development, lots of testing, setting up hubs, upgrading payment service providers and POS apps, upgrading wallets, exchanges, libraries, and everything, then teaching new users, and hoping they're still there...)
- what do you think the fee will be then? (=X)
- do you really believe, that showing my Mom how she can open a channel (=lock her money) for a high fee (=X) will cut it? And saying that she can unlock her funds for another X will make her say "woohoo!"?
In 2 years we'll have instant and free wire transfers across the EU. Non-bank banks such as N26 already offers free accounts with a free bankcard and free everything... Which is real utility. Do you think the value proposition of Bitcoin, even with LN, will be superior than this?

SWIFT is only a messaging network, although a very old one and a pain in the ass to deal with. IMF and SDRs do not appear at all at this level. Central bank clearing may come in, but not always. Iinternational transfers are mostly done through correspondent accounts. It is mostly local and regional transfers that go through central bank clearing - that's usually faster snd cheaper.
Ripple does the same when it ripples a transfer through various order books and gateways. The idea is the same. Difference is that the way described here takes anywhere from 1 day to 10, and costs a lot. Ripple does the exact same thing in 5 seconds and fees are free market based.

Then that means they're either:
- fixing the code in their own codebase, then re-deploy that (no need for a manual server rebuild)
- upgrade their server image which is again, a few minutes worst case.
Which means we're still back at production servers shouldn't be installed manually. You did that back in 2003 maybe but not now.

Add extreme thinblocks to the mix (why validate transactions twice if they're probably already in the mempool?)
... then you've got a real scaling solution which keeps Bitcoin decentralized, simple and having more throughput than ever (together with raising maxblocksize of course).

This could be delivered in many ways. In fact, it could be delivered faster with a simple blocksize increase, as there would be no need for a new tx format.

@_date: 2016-01-18 00:07:17
Those nodes wouldn't be a huge problem, because miners wouldn't produce blocks on the weaker chain.
We'd have a problem when 50% of miners would mine an alternative chain, and no one would want to give up their own chain.
That's why Classic aims for 75% majority AFAIK.
@_date: 2017-03-20 08:20:41
You're describing exactly the problem I am bringing up. It's only worth running a LN node if you have lots of spare capital = LN node centralization.

@_date: 2017-03-09 10:30:51
This is of course full speculation of course - no one knows in advance which coin's price will plummet.
I am betting for the one on the minority chain.
Everyday users will be going with the cheaper/faster one, and users play a big part in Bitcoin's price increase, as they have to buy it before transferring it.
@_date: 2017-03-09 13:00:00
Yes, but the point is, economies of scale will kick in and hubs will have the incentive to become bigger and bigger, with users also incentivized to join the bigger hubs... Which means we'll probably have a mesh of a few big hubs only (don't know the exact number, but certainly less than the amount of full nodes we'd have at the same point in time).
The question is, what will be the incentive to keep hubs small?
@_date: 2017-03-13 16:19:51

Exactly. Somehow interestingly everyone running or taking part in a real Bitcoin business with real users and real daily transactions feel that Core's roadmap is fatally flawed.
Major Core commiters should be answering support phone calls at Bitcoin companies for two weeks.

Maybe they'll simply discard the experience by pulling out the "paid shills by Ver brainsucked by reptilians" card just to support their twisted worldview.
@_date: 2017-03-09 10:46:21

Then there's something I don't understand. If raising the blocksize limit will make it harder (more expensive) to run a full node at home, and Lightning Network comes to the rescue – how will it rescue us if it still requires a full node to be run + some extra cash?
No matter what the blocksize is, if running a LN node *always* costs more than running a simple full node, how will it help in keeping Bitcoin decentralised?

Relevance to what?
@_date: 2017-03-14 09:17:08
1) The market will decide in due time after reaching &gt;75% consensus. If I was a miner I'd start proposing rules now, given emergent consensus' growing support. And I'd have it activate after a certain amount of time (3-6 months) after a specified block height, so everyone can upgrade. This is what I would do, not what they'll do. (I'm not a miner)
2) why do you think a chain split is a failure? It did absolutely good to Ethereum, it ended a burgeoning civil war. I think it would do good to Bitcoin as well. Everyone would get what they want, with their own vision of the coin. And don't tell me it's a big economy, it isn't. It's nothing. And if Bitcoin can't survive a split, the experiment failed. Ethereum survived and does better now than before the DAO fiasco started. Now it's Bitcoin's turn to show how it can renew itself.
Don't forget, cryptocurrencies are a social experiment. They could still fail for a multitude of reasons.
If we don't let cryptocurrencies do mistakes or fail, and then learn from it, we've just wasted our time circle jerking on internet forums and burning a billion's worth of VC money on meaningless startups.

@_date: 2017-03-05 23:02:03
How will LN help decentralisation? Hubs will be even more centralized than current/node miners due to high capital requirements.
You need $200 now to run a full node for the next 2 years. Let's multiply that by 10, let's make it $2000 (nonsense and astronomically high).
You need millions/tens/hunderds of millions to run a LN hub. That's several orders of magnitude greater than the nonsense $2000 to run a node.
Anyone care to explain how LN will help keep Bitcoin decentralised by having these heavily centralised entities?

But then again - who wants a bank account that LOCKS your money, and "topping it up" or "withdrawing it" costs you a shitload of money?
I'd vote for LN (and hope someone comes up with a working routing mechanism) - but only with inexpensive locking/settlement (ie. we still need more onchain capacity for this to work)

Fraction of the current price.
Btw industrial demand isn't the same as intrinsic value.
Demand is demand and that's the only thing that is reflected in metals' or cryptocurrencies' price.
Doesn't matter where the demand comes from, it won't become intrinsic value by being a special type of demand.
Here's a prediction for the next 15 years: we'll have a computing breakthrough and leave silicon behind. Industrial demand for gold will disappear, but old school investors will still buy it because of tradition. BTC:GOLD price will slowly increase due to more and more people choosing BTC as a safe hedging asset vs. gold.

Trust me I've read a lot about it, and I understand how it works.
The model that the Core gods envisioned is the following: $50 to lock or settle (=mining fee), but you'll only be doing this once or twice a year, so you probably don't care much.
What if I need more money than I previously locked, and don't have anything to sell on LN? What if I want to settle once a month?
These are very valid questions.

Bitcoin Core just released 0.12 with libsecp256k1 and a 7x speedup in signature validation (we gained 3 more years in computing power just by doing this). There is plenty of room for optimizations and growth.
We won't reach 600 tps overnight (that's 100x of the current heavily congested network, including currently stuck transactions). I'd say another 5-10 year to reach that – IF (and only if) the growth is not artificially capped.
There is clear need for a peer-to-peer electronic cash system, and if Bitcoin can't deliver, then others will (this is the beauty of voluntary free market forces, right?)
The question isn't really about price-performance, it's about traction. If another team (or altcoin) can deliver results faster, sooner or later people will start to flee Bitcoin (it has already begun, unfortunately).

Bitcoin's resilience is protected and secured by massive mining capacity. Writing blog posts doesn't secure the network.
If you want a protocol upgrade invest your hashpower into it. That's how Bitcoin was designed to be secure, decentralized and resistent to sybil attacks.
And if you say "but but.... miners attacked us... more than 51% acts in bad faith (according to me)" - then the whole premise of proof of work backed securing of hashlists failed, and you're free to not use it anymore. I wouldn't use anything myself  that I don't consider secure.
Having said that - I support BIP148 as well. 
It helps in making the divorce quick and painless compared to how ugly it would get in 5 years.
I hope everyone will be happy with their version of the protocol.
Most people don't even know about cryptocurrencies. They won't care about their names.

Streaming HD movies online seemed a lunatic idea back in '99. And now netflixing became a verb.
Then, second - this is still about node count. Bigger blocks = fewer nodes. There was a research on that (BitFury I think). That was a great paper.
But that's again about node count. No one ever researched how many nodes do we really need. Everyone talks about low node count as a bad thing, but at this point, without research, it's more of a religious / pseudoscientific thing.
That's what I'm interested in. How many nodes are enough? With what bandwidth? What geaographic distribution?
How does it affect latency, throughput, censorship?
No one researched this so far.

Can you share any peer reviewed academic paper exploring this?
I've seen this statement come up many times, but so far everyone failed to show how bigger blocksizes will really hurt decentralization.
The most repeated mantra was that it affects node count - but did anyone do a research on the topic? How many nodes are good, how many nodes are bad? Any tests? Any scientific evidence?
Most people can't even say something like "we need at least X amount of nodes".
TL;DR - please share any academic research that backs your claim.
Thank you.

Operator of Hungary's first BTM here.
I signed up Anker Klub (a restaurant / cafe in Budapest where my BTM is located) to accept Bitcoin.
They give a 10% discount on Bitcoin purchases and keep all the coins.
They got tremendous amounts of PR because of accepting BTC and hosting the BTM. They also get lots of foot traffic for this.
They are in negative due to last year's price crash, but the amount of publicity they get far more outweighs that. They see it as a marketing cost.
They are not your typical good-PR-zero-BTC-purchase merchant as they did hundreds of transactions since last Fall.
They'll only consider selling the coins if Bitcoin's price skyrockets, until then they'll just hold it. Even with hundreds of transactions the volume is so negligible vs. fiat transactions that they don't have cashflow problems with keeping the coins for now.
Hope this helps.

Great stuff coming up with numbers at last. 
All my previous posts here asking for numbers (even if purely theoretical) failed miserably. 
I am glad people started to come up with topologies finally.
Here are a few questions that are still not clear to me:
- how many on-chain transactions?
- what is the blocksize?
- what is the mining fee distribution?
- most importany: how much does it cost to run a node? In your example you assume 100k nodes with $70k locked. That is a lot of money. Today a vocal minority complains about running a node for $200. How will we have 100k nodes with $70k/node locked down?
- how much money will a node make?
- how much bandwidth will a node consume?
- as a user I am motivated to handpick  bigger, better connected nodes that will cost me less. Experience shows that people today still keep their Bitcoins on exchanges and don't fear them getting stolen - and they'll probably not act differently with a big LN node that has a higher chance of failure (and a higher chance to be unable to get the fraud preventing transaction to get confirmed in time)
- is right, a power law distribution is way more realistic - especially if economies of scale kicks in, and big players outbid small player with their huge stash of BTC (by giving better terms to their users - less hops, lower fees). 
As I see it, there's a natural pressure towards bigger, more efficient and centralized nodes.
And I still don't understand if running a node with 2 (or even 20!) MB blocks today is such a huge financial problem (at least in this sub), then how on earth will we get 100k nodes with $70k locked down each?
tl;dr everything re:centralization pressure applies to LN as well, with several orders of magnitude in the wrong direction.
Thank you for sharing your thoughts on the above.

About Roger Ver / Bitmain: the difference between you and I is...
You guys don't seem to understand that there are people who don't need central guidance. You simply can't comprehend that those who want big blocks are not led by any figure. That's only your projection bias working at full effect.
I was here, posting and commenting, and wanting bigger blocks and a sane scaling roadmap before even Gavin was crucified. Then came Mike Hearn. I was still promoting bigger blocks as a first step.
Then "clients promoting contentious network splits" were banned here. I still wanted bigger blocks and lower fees. My goalpost didn't change.
Now you people are obsessed with Roger Ver and Jihan and Bitmain...
And started actively promoting clients engaging in the most contentious network split ever (UASF). And now it's allowed - this is a complete joke.
I am still here, I want bigger blocks, and I don't care who your actual scapegoats are.
Tomorrow you'll find someone else instead of Roger Ver or Bitmain, but I will still be here, and will want bigger blocks, and decentralisation of Bitcoin development through multiple implementations and teams.
Your goalposts constantly move, you always think there's someone we follow - but believe me, that's not how our mind works. That's how your mind works. And that's you projection bias.
When blaming Roger Ver and Bitmain will be a thing of the past (beside Hearn and Andresen) we'll still be here.
And we'll still want the same thing: decentralized development and a sane scaling roadmaps starting with bigger blocks and lower fees.
Our goalposts don't change. Yours will, and you will contradict yourself many times again.
Wake up. Start to think. It's worth it.

As I said, multiple people have multiple oppinions. SegWit is just one proposal of the many. 68% not adopting that code means they don't think it is a good proposal. That's not called blocking - that's called having a different oppinion.
But if you insist on calling it blocking, miners are also blocking bigger blocks, including Segwit signalling miners. 50% of miners would to see bigger blocks. SegWit never had that level of support, so technically speaking, adapting your worldview, bigger blocks are blocked by miners.
But back to the original question. What do you think - how much money should be in a LN channel for sub-dollar fees?

Nodes can be easily sybil attacked. I can spin up thousands of nodes to signal anything I'd want, so node count doesn't mean anything.
Wallets will be "ready" for anything that has a slight chance of activation, because that's what is good for their users. They could even be ready for multiple proposals in parallel. You can click on "weighted" stats on coin.dance and you'll see that businesses that are in explicit support of SW are in minority.
SegWit wasn't even on the table when 100% of the SPV wallets (which most people use BTW - feel free to call it an economic majority) already supported bigger blocks without any investment in coding, so by your standards SegWit is blocking bigger blocks in this regard as well.
By THEY I mean Core devs (among whom some are hired by Blockstream as well), and they said this multiple times in social media. If you haven't catched it you should follow their communications closer.

In an earlier post where I asked how LN will prevent centralization ( people told me LN disincentivizes big channels and big LN nodes. Someone even said it will be for $20-$100 channels.
So which one is it?
- Keeping it decentralized and opening $20-$100 channels for $100 fees, or
- having massive centralization through LN nodes and opening paycheque sized channels? (see above link for basic math of capital requirements for this scenario)

Great project. Good luck with getting it up and running as soon as you can. Cyprus and Europe needs such institutions.
I would be interested in 2 things:
1) in case of the pegged account, how do you hedge yourself without exposing yourself to EUR currency risk and without imposing major costs on your customers?
2) You want to provide a fully compliant and regulated service. What happens if the regulator decides on a new bail-in, and forces you to take another 20%, now from your Bitcoin denominated accounts? To stay compliant, you'll have to deduct it from accounts, no matter those are Bitcoin denominated or not. Or you can say: "We don't have control over the accounts as we do not store customer private keys". Then they revoke your license and you can go to prison for illegall money services. How would you handle this scenario?

You had the possibility to opt-out by waiving your rights state-provided pension in the future (which will be nonexistent by then). 100,000 people out of 3 million opted out as a sign of protest. The government called the confiscation "Protecting pensions from the hands of greedy private firms".
They spent the entire amount (13 years worth of national savings - roughly 15 billion euros) in just a few weeks. The debt to GDP ratio went down a few percent points, but we're at a historical high again, way higher than it was _before_ the confiscation.
