Hey I am the owner of The Cube Athens, the partner space hosting this very interesting experiment. Yes, there are indeed capital controls that prohibit the movement of money outside of the country, so we have agreed with all involved that if the BTM needs to be emptied, (which may not happen since people are buying and selling coin) any cash removed will be deposited in a local Greek bank account, so no money will be moved out of the system.

This experiment is at 0% commission. The owners of the terminal need to complete their company incorporation before they can do any commercial trade i.e. charge a commission which is subject to corporate tax and VAT. Until this process is complete, no commission can be charged.
