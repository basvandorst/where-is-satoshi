yes great for remittances, cheaper faster, but i hope the "[Aquino-Cojuangco]( agenda doesnt corrupt this shit... i mean they already have rediculus internet laws.... but hopefully this is one thing they cannot touch...

BTR, is like Cryptsy Points. Its points accumilated when doing trades on bter.com When u see that they will use bter points, i belive its a way to pay transaction fees using their point system. U dont need to worry about btr points as they are like reward points that stay in the bter.com system.
