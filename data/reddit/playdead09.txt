Okay. Coinbase has been hacked 0 times so far... IF a hacker successfully hack Coinbase, it would affect Millions of users. Whereas the other option affects only each individual. Hacking Coinbase is a very high target. I'd take my chances using my own crypto storage.

For the Trashcoins yes. However, few alts with good fundamentals will still grow. New HYPE coins will always come up every now and then and take a pump and go away.

So, if they have to "pay out" a customer, and have to have access to it... I assume a human will have to process it. Well, from history and experience, humans make errors. There are a multitude of attack vectors, and only one really needs to be successful to get in. Think of banks and how they got robbed many times in the early days. It was years and years of experience that they are at a point now where they have vaults and emergency buttons and cameras, security guards.. etc. Crypto is new and I am pretty certain we cannot mitigate all attacks/hacks. It's a vulnerable space, and from the years of experience in being in crypto space I can personally say there were many breaches in crypto space that much of the community had felt was secure.

I believe Newegg and Overstock still accept it. But overall I don't see why Steam backing off of it is such a big deal. The price jumped up and got congested and is basically going through some growing pains. It'll take a while, but like any other stock or thing that is traded... prices will stabilize. Plus with Lightning network coming.. that'll be another incentive to start accepting it again.

Watch it here
@ around 14:30 central? I'm not good with time zones.

So I don't need to panic and switch to a different wallet??

sidebar won't always have all the info and most of the time not the latest info. That's what the community is here for, post your questions or search the sub. There has been many posts about secure coin management. A lot of "this is how I hodl my coins" and the concept of hot and cold wallets. 
The point is, when holding a considerable amount of wealth, it's best to control your own private keys, in whatever method you use. When you just have a login to coinbase.. that's all you have. If coinbase get's hacked or they turn out to be scammers you lose it all. Not saying that will happen idk, but if you have the private keys or that wallet.dat file, you have the 1's and 0's that is your coins.

Question is, as a day trader, how do you know if you "held" for a year? Say you put $1K in Jan. and trade in alt coins etc.. but never withdraw in fiat until the following year, did you hold for a year?
And even more complicated is, say you had 1 BTC for over a year and bought more every month.. but cashed out a portion of it, how does the IRS know it was the BTC that was held over the last year or its the BTC that you've been buying for the past few months?

I'd also been using Gemini and have Zero complaints.

To those suggesting moving to your own wallet. As a beginner PLEASE read and make sure you know what you are doing. Download the wallet from a trusted source so you don't get trojan'd. Encrypt your wallet with a good password YOU CAN REMEMBER!! I don't know how many times I've heard of new folks moving their coins and forgetting password or losing they wallet.dat file. On that thought back up your wallet.dat file, it's your encrypted key.
With that being said. I suggest using Bread wallet on iOS for most people. You get to keep your own private keys and its easy to use/maintain. You may not have full control of the forked coins, but they did give bread users the ability to withdraw Bitcoin Cash after a few weeks.

Neither? Let's stop right here and take a couple 100 feet back. Read up on how to properly store and secure cryptocurrencies before you get in to this space. If you are talking about a few hundred dollars on coinbase or gemini, then fine, keep it there (since it is FDIC insured). If you are putting a significant amount of wealth into this please store it on a wallet where you CONTROL the private keys (not password, the private cryptographic keys). Couple ways to do this is to use a hardware wallet like the Ledger S Nano, or Desktop client like the actual bitcoin core client, I also believe the Bread wallet on iOS is a place you have your own private key. Note: Just like keeping cash, if you misplace your public key (i.e., lose/forget it) you will lose you money. Learn to back up and practice safe password keeping habits.

I've been using vivaldi for the past year, it's wonderful. Uses chrome back end... without the bloat. Also firefox quantum is great. I use both, but vivaldi is my primary daily driver.

I panicked too early! bought at 11.2k. Wish I waited for 10.8k

Calculating Taxes on Crypto trading seem to be very difficult. I imagine a significant amount of people in the general public that decided to try out crypto trading are not going to know anything about FIFO or that each trade is a taxable event.. etc. My question is, was there any event in history where something like this happened before and how did the IRS handle it in the past? Are we going to get a pardon or given some leniency, or are we going to be royally screwed?

Price will skyrocket to 10k leading up through the weekend, and Sunday BTC will say APRIL FOOLS!!! I'm worth 4,5k. Holla~
@_date: 2018-02-02 16:03:20
low volume. not enough buy support over 9k
@_date: 2017-10-13 17:14:29
how to do this?
@_date: 2017-10-13 16:02:03
So it says to add a node to the chain you want to be on... What node can I put for original non-forked good ol' Bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-15 15:13:28
Agreed. Mass adoption is key. While this may not be the decentralized commerce we want, with more people using Bitcoin I feel we are heading towards the right direction. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 20:09:38
it's a TRAP!
@_date: 2018-04-10 16:27:11
okay. what's the diff? 
@_date: 2018-04-10 15:09:40
Depends. The "Market" will see bitcoin as becoming more scarce (supply down, demand up) therefore price will go up. Making up the difference for the miners to keep mining even tho they get half the amount of bitcoins, they will be worth twice as much. Then one might say, if the price does not go up.. most miners will stop mining. When this happens, the bitcoin network difficulty will adjust automatically.. making it easier to mine, thus drawing miners back! It's beautiful how self-perpetuating it is. :)
