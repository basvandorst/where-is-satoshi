Hashocean is a Ponzi scheme. Just google it and you'll find out.

You know what's Scam : HYIPs, many Crowsfoundings with shabby projects, Pumps and Dumps of crypto currency on a daily basis. Here is a company that shows their fees and gives you Bitcoin mining calculation and clearly doesn't give any unrealistic promises and you guys call it a scam ? This is an investment like any other legit ones. If Bitcoin price goes up, we'll make money and vice versa. Good luck to all !

When you read their legal mambo jumbo , you'll see they can force you sell your share for the original price. I love mycelium and was very excited first until I read their legal disclosure.

I have Keepkey and very happy with it.

I use Genesis Mining . It takes about a year for ROI. As a long term investment, it's great ! But for short term gamblers, it's a nightmare.

Not yet. I started two weeks ago with 21 TH/s. I know it can go up or go to zero. I think Genesis is the most transparent company so far. In long term ( 5-10 years) we'll see.

Go Genesis Go ! Stand up for the underdog and the same time introduce BTC to the public. Great idea !

I've had nothing but good experiences with BTCC.

Any crowdfunding?

You mean 5000 Dogecoin ? I think you're in the wrong sub Reddit. Who will announce 5000 BTC ? Look, I have the other 14,955,000 BTCs and I never announce it. I keep mine under my mattress .

Avoid all ICOs at all cost !

Thank you ! Very unusual

I'm so impressed the Founder of Keepkey helped me solve the problem. Way to go ! 
PS: this is my second keepkey. Excellent service !

Coinbase sucks ! Unethical crooks

I've been waiting 8.5 hours for my confirmation. Very disappointed !

My luck I was encouraging a friend to use BTC for the first time. He thinks all I've said about BTC is just a talk.

Hi, I'm broke ! I should have come up with the Satoshi impersonation first to get something to feed my family! But darn Craig beat me to it.

Such a sad story. No money worth a human life.
