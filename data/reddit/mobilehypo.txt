In **many** states in the US, you are treated exactly the same way if you are only carrying what is considered enough for personal use.
Listen, you have to realize that the US is a collection of states that share a large portion of laws, but not all of them, and not all of them are enforced the same way. We have way more similarity to something like the EU than non-Americans realize. The way my state runs is nothing like how states in the South run in a lot of ways. 
* It's legal to be fully nude in the Portland, Oregon area. 
* You can be topless as a woman in NY state. 
* Weed is legal in the state of Colorado. 
* My state, Minnesota, administers a healthcare plan that covers everyone who can't afford or isn't offered their own (this was in place years before the now infamous "Obamacare").
* You can't own handguns in some ~~states~~ jurisdictions / cities / counties, in others you can carry them concealed.
It's impossible to lump all of the US into one bin because, while not as diverse as countries in the EU, the states are definitely diverse enough that ignorance of a local law can get you sent to jail. Hell even traffic laws are different!

I may have misspoke, but let me put a different spin on it: The chances of you getting a permit in some parts of the country such as Los Angeles, are extremely low even though in theory the state allows owning of handguns. I cannot remember the other jurisdictions off hand that have this sort of thing going, but there are more than a few. I believe DC is another. There are definitely cities and counties that have banned handguns independent of state laws.
