I agree, I am somewhat knew to all this and learning daily but I figure there will always be a need for quarters, dimes, nickels and pennies to BTC's dollar.
Just my 0.000005 BTC

I have seen others offer to do this and I am curious to how you help confirm transactions. Mining? Running a Node? I would like to be able to help others in these situations if you don't mind sharing how this is done.

I currently have .0285 BTC so 1 BTC would be impressive. 10 would definitely be "a lot". &gt;10 BTC would be just........(no words) lol.

If this is real it is one of, if not the best thing I have ever seen on Reddit! You Sir/Ma'am are what the world needs more of, many kudos to you.

Thanks for the additional info. Yes, I am going to run it as a full validation node. I am somewhat familiar with the opening of port 8333 and such from previously reading the info to which you linked. My only concern was if running the node would interfere with my daily activities or if my daily activities would interfere with the node.
One thing I a undecided about is whether or not to use pruning. I have about 250gb of free space on the SSD I'll be storing the blockchain on so I am figuring pruning isn't really necessary?

Congratulations! Then the rest of my comment definitely stands. :)
Enjoy your BitCoin! :)

Appreciate the tip, I'll get up and going with the new release.

Yeah this is the kinda thing I was wondering. I went ahead and got it up and running yesterday instead of waiting for the updates (which I will upgrade to at release). 
Running it with default settings (no pruning) opened the 8333 port and it was off to the races. Working great with no issues, don't even know its running. When I get back into some gaming I'll watch the ping rates and see what, if anything needs doing concerning the pings.

Thanks for the quick reply, I'll let it download the blockchain later tonight then.
