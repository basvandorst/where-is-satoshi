Yep, Proof-of-Catan, makes the crypto-world go 'round

And we can name one “Blockchain” to confuse the banking and MSM folk trying to get in on the game!

Number one is number one, IMO. It has the most approachable design of the three, and it feels more “.org” than the others. Two and three feel like exchange, bank or investment business sites.

I like it! Then a BCH "bit" would have to distinguish itself as bitCH! 
Neat ;)

Perhaps we'll be using side-chain coins to help with situations of theft or loss
As for the existence of robbers, we should raise better people.

You buy the bitcoin; you hire her for something valuable, and may pay her in bitcoin... or sell them to her.

Move your coins off the exchange if you are not intending to sell/trade them. 
Once they are in your Trezor wallet, should there be a fork, you will be able access any forked coins (after software update) - see what happened for Trezor users during the Bcash fork.

What is "blockchina"?

Bank System's famous catch phrase, "Don't have a cash, man!".

A friend joked that I was secretly wealthy via early "Bitcoin" investment. I had no idea what he was talking about at the time. Shortly after I looked it up and fell through the rabbit hole!

Where's HODL!?

Awesome! [Here's me halving a themed pizza!](
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:57:35
Actually, pie (in the video) was eaten!
@_date: 2016-07-09 17:57:34
Next halving. ;)
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:09:59
That's too bad. [I cut my themed pizza in half!]( With permission of course! ;)

I think we will see a steady rise back to about 8,000 (to 10,000) by August 15, 2019

Wow, thanks! That was unexpected. I will use my first changetip in bitcoin to teach others how to hodl. :)
