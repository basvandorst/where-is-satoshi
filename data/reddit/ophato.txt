Pretty much what you said but it depends on the amount of money ofcourse.. 0-300 k i will just continue how i’m living now but with less stress and a bit more fun, 300-900k i will put 100% of my time into my business, i will invest in the housing market and other local start ups. And from 900k and above, the same as 300-900k but bigger better and i will try to help as many people as possible with improving their lives, giving them education a second change stuff like that.
A quote that i will remember someone said is “money is not the destination, it is just a tool for the journey”

Do it, No reason not to start.
When someone asks me for advice before they start getting into crypto i always tell them to just put a few bucks into it. Build some confidence with the way the market works.

Just a dude, 2 parttime jobs working 40hours a week and starting my own custom interior/furniture business. Putting everything i don’t need r/n in crypto so that i don’t have to work shitty jobs my whole life.
