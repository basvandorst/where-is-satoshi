But where are the practical limits? I don't think we care if you can't run a full node on a $7 arduino, nor do I think it's healthy to target hardware that's *too* low in capacity due to the dramatic falloff in cost/benefits and diminishing return this imposes on the network.
What is the upper maximum on how much a full node should cost, and what can that hardware handle?

Too much? These are basic questions that should be well established at this point. There is much contention over blocksize and decentralization is the primary factor for consideration. There is also contention over how LN will effect decentralization due to the costs of funding a node with a large throughput. Since decentralization is what makes Bitcoin... well, everything that's Bitcoin, we should have a clear definition of how decentralized we mean.
Without that, "decentralization" becomes akin to a buzzword we decorate sentences with to make them look pretty. I am staunchly opposed to that no matter what the topic is.

Honestly, that's optimistic. Look at any logarithmic BTC chart and you'll see a fairly stable, steady growth in the 50MA until about May of last year where it kicks into overdrive and carries through the bubble. It ought to correct to the projection of that steady curve, which is approximately $4000.
I hate that I can call a figure like this, then second guess myself and lose money, only for the pattern to play out *exactly* as I initially estimated. So this time, I'm sticking to my guns and wont be participating in the market any time soon. But BTC entered the bubble as soon as it left that curve, and it's likely to *overcorrect* and then settle around that mean.
Don't despair, though. ETH has far, far worse prospects if you do the same rudimentary analysis...
@_date: 2018-01-08 01:35:02
That is not an answer to my question. In fact, the same question applies to LN, and the answer is *independent* of LN. We know for instance that LN will eventually require a blocksize increase, even if as you correctly point out the optimal figure isn't yet known. But I'm asking about practical limits, a question pertinent for LN because if, say, lightning requires 4mb blocks (way less than LN's early estimates) but the practical limit is 2mb, there's a problem.
The answer is more philosophical. Is the target degree of decentralization akin to so ubiquitous children run a full node off 1 weeks $10 allowance for a school project? Is that level of decentralization beneficial considering the cost factor? Or should it require, say, something like a $500 or so gaming rig (or maybe even just an XBOX). At $10 I suspect blocksize would need to be very small, possibly smaller than LN can support. On a $500 rig, things are far more flexible, but your average Mexican day laborer at $4.15/day isn't going to be able to afford to run such a node.
Who should run the average full node? What price target does that set? What is the hardware capable of doing at that price level? There is no perfect answer, but what is the philosophy being pursued here?
@_date: 2018-01-08 03:22:58
Fair enough, but where is the line? Where is decentralization insufficient (like the future of BCash you describe), sufficient (the ideal) and past the point of diminishing returns (eg full nodes on an Atari). What's the ideal range?
I've never gotten a straight answer to this question: Who, in an ideally decentralized situation, should be running a full node?

Peer to peer lending is a viable alternative to centralized banks. The only reason you don't hear much about it ATM is because institutional investors drowned the market before it caught on in the mainstream (read: peer to peer works really well, but you are such an insignificant peer that you'll drown in an ocean of whale spit).
There have been quite a few platforms that earned people a lot of money before the whales noticed and snapped up all the best opportunities. I think one was called Lending Club IIRC, and it worked by dicing up big loans into $25 pieces and letting investors buy and sell them something like a bond. Included was a credit analysis based on FICO, but if we're imagining a world where banks are dead FICO's probably out. I can see a lot of ways smart contracts and tokens can replace FICO/credit history though, so instead of the murky blackbox that is the myriad ways FICO gets calculated, one might rely on the blockchain in a clear, easily verifiable manner (that doesn't cost $60 to peek at!).
Thing is, sure I don't have $400,000 to loan out, but some people do, and it wouldn't be much of a risk. Break it into pieces and sell them to mom and pop immediately (well before the usual default period) and suddenly your risk is minimal.
Really, the problem is unscrupulous people offering really crappy (subprime) initial loans and hawking them off on mom and pop who really have no business assessing the integrity of a specific loan application.

Sorry, but likely not. If it was a personal wallet, and you generated it using a memnonic/passphrase, then recalling that passphrase and whatever salt you used in a wallet generator (that you trust!) would work. Alternatively, retrieving the wallet.dat file if you didn't use a passphrase as was the Way of Things in the Days of Yore... but basically you have an uncrackable safe without the combo.
At least you didn't throw away a hard-drive with *thousands* of bitcoins on it, as that poor guy all over the news did.

What you're saying is equivalent to "I know which house was my old apartment, using only that information how do I get the key to the front door?" Simply put, you need your private key for the wallet. One of the quintessential features of cryto in general is that it's secured by that private key.
Now, if you know that address is owned by someone (like an exchange), then it may be possible to contact the exchange and restore a lost account (that is, if you signed up somewhere with a username/password and they had custodianship of the actual wallet/address). The analogy there is the property manager at your old appartment complex might have the keys.
But if knowing the address was enough to get access, any time anyone tried to send anything to anyone, that'd be enough information to steal all their money. Would kinda defeat bitcoin's purpose...
Best of luck!

Possibly. I was expecting fierce resistance at the 50, but sentiment is so low and there has been so much media hype (read: new, inexperienced speculators) that I suspect the bears will break through. If that happens, from there it's open season.
For Hodlers, it's a massive discount. This time *may* be somewhat different, though, because during all those other crashes BTC retained market dominance. Ripple and altcoins are poised to siphon off the speculators, and that might hold the price down. Further, the current difficulties with the mempool/tx fees are further suppressing enthusiasm.
This will, by my uneducated guess, be a very, very slow recovery driven more by organic demand increases rather than speculative enthusiasm. BTC's dominant position is vulnerable like never before. Ripple may be crap for a myriad of reasons, but so was VHS. Do you even know what Betamax is (few do:  Perhaps more recently, HD-DVD vs Blueray (HD-DVD was technically superior, but Sony learned from VHS and killed it dead).
For my part, I'm too conservative an investor to be participate in the market until things are less vulnerable. For those more enthusiastic than I, this is a perfect time to stock up and HODL.

Theoretically it shouldn't be too hard to script something to turn the smart contract into something more human readable (this already exists). After that, existing infrastructure can take over - and by that, I mean courts and law enforcement not necessarily banks. IANAL but AFAIK Courts of law are agnostic to the currency involved in contracts. The only snag is whether smart contracts are legally binding, which any government can flat out say they aren't.
You can avoid wage garnishment now using the same techniques that apply against cryptos, so that's really not a unique problem here and clearly the infrastructure still works. If you're getting paid under the table, your employer is breaking the law regardless of whether it's Crypto or Fiat. If you're not, and the government wants a piece of that for whatever (hopefully legal) reason, then it will go after the employer for garnishment, not hope you send all your money to a convenient address.

Also, since a lot of prepper-minded people refer to cryptos, let us not forget the oft cited EMP. EMP is no bueno for cryptos.
Also in a far more probable hyper-inflationary scenario, there's no guarantee that the infrastructure will continue to function. It wouldn't even require the infrastructure itself to be damaged, just that the guy who's supposed to run it is more concerned with finding food...
@_date: 2018-06-10 01:52:21
While the pulse itself is short lived, the damage is effectively permanent. Any circuit fried by an EMP, like your smart phone and laptop, must be completely replaced. Unfortunately, virtually everyone impacted is also seeking to replace their machine parts, and presumably, all the facilities for producing said parts are also fried. More-over, more critical infrastructure must be restored first, putting luxury items at the back of a very long queue. Zero supply, unfathomable demand. Good luck getting access to a computer any time soon.
And that's without accounting for the minimum *two years* it would take to replace even a fraction of the transformers required to provide power (in the US alone). Unless you already have a faraday protected alternative energy source, you wont be using anything that requires electricity for a very, very long time.
Last but not least, the internet itself might "survive" in a military capacity, but certainly not for civilian use. We tend to overestimate the survivability of "The Internet" because we confuse a dispersed communications network with the things we built *on top* of it, like Google. The internet may survive, but you wont be accessing it.
It would also, depending on the area effected, eliminate all miners. So there'd be no hash power at all, or at best, scattered pockets of hash power that cant communicate and therefore each have a unique chain split.
No, bitcoin is many great things, but EMP resistant it is not.

This is a double edged sword that has a simple solution.
It's double edged because consumer debt is a **very bad thing** for economies. Economies based on consumer debt fail hard and fast within a generation. Guess what's happening as we speak? Yeah, this has historical precedent (although, this time is so much worse because it's a global, not local phenomenon). History doesn't repeat, but it does rhyme.
It's also double edged because high liquidity and loans are the lifeblood of modern (Read: post 1800) economies. Done *sanely*, having access to loans means businesses are easier to get started. Since 99% of buisnesses fail, making it easy to start a business is in the macro sense a very good idea. Problem today is, *we don't do anything remotely approaching sanity.* Businesses nowadays take loans to repurchase stocks and pay off old loans. Nowhere in that previous sentence does anything actually increase their revenue, and that means they are entirely incapable of repaying this debt without cuts they'd never want to implement (dividend cut would defeat the purpose of the stock repurchases, who the heck will cut their own salary, and cutting workers rarely leads to direct revenue increases). It's a ticket to insolvency.
So, consumer loans are poison, corporate loans are a necessity, but sanity is required for both. How can this be solved without banks? Peer-to-peer lending and crowdfunding. Yes, you will need someone to orchestrate it (and you can call that a "bank"), but doing what LendingClub or any of its comepetitors did on a larger scale would be a simple solution that would also democratize loans (that is, let even the poor get a fair chunk of the massive profits that at the moment are reserved for banks and banks alone).

That isn't really paying with bitcoin though, any more than the local $0.99 store accepts gold payments (*via goldmoney.com or whatever their site is*).

In a peer to peer situation? The way Lending Club usually does things is to break a loan into many, many smaller pieces. $25, though that's not a magic number by any stretch. Most investors buy *one piece* of a loan, or just $25 worth. If that loan defaults, instead of screwing one or two people, it's actually just a tiny writeoff for a lot of people.
If people default *en masse*, which should never happen unless the lenders are doing stupid things (Which banks are incentivised to do and do so wantonly), then yes the lenders are going to be punished for it. **This is natural** so far as economics goes. But again, unless something is seriously wrong, no one will want to offer up a 15 year ARM to someone without a job and terrible credit, let alone do that millions of times then act surprised when a good chunk of those default. That's banker logic (namely because they know the government will bail them out or they can package and sell the loan before the default).

It is illegal in more places than it's not. Also, in places where it's nominally legal it's often made effectively illegal by those self-same moralists.
Besides, if most of the world's GDP exists in countries that ban and/or heavily restrict the use of cryptos, it doesn't matter what the other countries do. The lack of a market will gut cryptos as surely as any other currency.

Now, I never said that oil was the only reason at all. It's just the major cause of the downturn.

I live in luxury, I suppose, since my car is only 17 years old, a 2001 Chevy that I repair myself. But that isn't _normal_ by any stretch. People are taught by their parents, friends, role models, teachers, and all of society to **consume**. They are taught how pathetic they are to eschew consumption, and any lesson that might help them conclude _not_ to consume is ruthlessly suppressed (note that ruthless suppression doesn't have to be _intentional_, and I'd argue it's more an emergent byproduct of society than any planned or "evil conspiracy").
As long as society works this way, it's unreasonable to expect people who _from birth_ have had virtually _every aspect_ of learning geared towards a specific end, to magically throw off that learning and behave in a fashion completely contrary to everything they know.

You do realize that's exactly what Bitcoin does right?
But assuming we're talking about government issued currencies, then linking that currency to a resource that grows at a rate slower than the economy - like, maybe a shiny metal rock that had been used for this exact purpose for many thousands of years until governments in the 20th century needed a short term way to pay for expensive wars - would do the trick.

I used to believe this, until I really did the math and looked at economics. Really, only rapid deflation is dangerous (but rapid _anything_ usually has consequences in economics). People act like deflation is some great horror that will kill all lending, but really deflation is literally just negative inflation. ~~People~~ Sane people in markets divorced from central banks have always set the rate on their loans at inflation+desired percentage. If that goes negative, oh no, the nominal interest rate will go down. And that's it.
There will be _incentives_ to save, and saving outside of banks would be a thing again, but really, the whole end of the world spiel is just propaganda designed at keeping you A-OK with the banking system while it siphons off your wealth year after year.

"Common man?" That's very hard to assess, probably because we have wildly divergent definitions. Let's assume "common man" means any member of the 3 lowest of 5 quintiles.

That depends on what measure you're using. If you take very selective points, you can paint the picture of either abject horror or relatively better positions for the average person. Remember, we keep less of our labor than even feudal peasants and have a _smaller_ share of the economic pie.
But, yes, in eras where governments employed laissez faire economic policies and let business interests run roughshod over the common man while fostering an economic environment condusive to the worst exploits of greed, the "world pretty much sucked" - at least for the people at the bottom rungs of specific societies totems. Don't forget "the word" is big, and while one area might have destitution another might prosper - but you wont learn about any society/culture's history but your own unless you do what amounts to exhaustive research.
EDIT: Gold stability
Gold (which I'm using for "precious metals" in general - Silver is as often used as Gold, for instance) was stable for thousands of years. There was virtually no inflation _at all_ in England from I believe 1200-1600, but I'd have to double check my dates on that, and low inflation in other periods. Keep in mind that the population, quality and production of goods and services exploded during this time, so "inflation" isn't the same as the money printing we see today and offset the deflationary pressure of gold itself.
We (the United States and the West) _did_ see instability under the gold standard, but that was a function of our business practices and often exacerbated by wars. Gold as a currency makes it _really hard_ to do deficit spending, and in fact our current economic mess is a direct result of the gold standard being abandoned to facilitate deficit spending (specifically WW1 for most of Europe and Vietnam in the US).

This meme is tired and requires extreme laziness on the part of its perpetuators.
Venezuela is an oil economy. It was an oil economy _before_ socialism and didn't become more of one under socialism. **The market fell out of oil**. When your _sole_ export goes down by over 50% and only slowly rallies at a time when your market share is getting crushed by new competition (namely expanded US production), your economy crashes.
