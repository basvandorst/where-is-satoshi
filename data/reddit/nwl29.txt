Bernard's a legend. Here is the story about his arrest in an first-hand interview: 
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:41:12
yeah that was a good point. also liked the Newton statements :-)
@_date: 2014-12-22 11:11:40
Yes, the author is well informed. He has written/is writing a book on Bitcoin (does anyone have a link?) and therefore is none of these '30 minutes of research before the editing deadline' type of journalist. 
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:05:35
there are some other factors as well. 
@_date: 2014-06-24 14:31:58
so true. same here. 
@_date: 2014-07-11 14:52:53
idiots! 
@_date: 2014-12-15 05:58:38
well said, Zahoo
@_date: 2014-07-11 13:07:09
and then the social engineering happened. emails from 'fake CEO' to 'real CTO' .....
@_date: 2014-06-28 14:13:08
good point.
@_date: 2014-07-11 16:05:01
isn't that the guy from proof of existance? 
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:43:57
i think most people don't get that it is a joke. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 11:12:49
paywall sux. i always thought that you can visit the site a certain number of times before the paywall triggers.... 
@_date: 2014-06-23 02:46:05
yes exactly. give it a few years and all these people will know about and use bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-12-22 11:01:34
i have been noticing lots of scam messages on youtube videos recently, too. 
@_date: 2014-06-21 03:46:41
That's who on Wallstreet is 'frontrunning' the trade

Here is an interview in full length with some very interesting stuff.  
@_date: 2014-12-15 02:08:43
"large broadcasters are not going to show a 'Bitcoin fanboy' film"
@_date: 2015-01-16 12:05:57
not defending anyone here but what if he wrote to his co-worker: "Ok, 10 Sushi rolls for me. Please go before 1pm. If you forget to bring wasabi again, I am going to f**ing KILL you" 
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:51:05
Don't share the pirated link, though ...
@_date: 2015-08-03 08:48:22
This will get much much worse ... 
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:57:32
yes you can:  later today. 
why fail? we worked two years on this ...
@_date: 2015-07-14 11:58:50
ehm. kinda   
@_date: 2015-07-14 12:00:51
well it;s a fine line. we must add production value to be taken serious by the larger broadcasters and Netflixes of the world. but yes, we are keeping good balance. hope you agree. 
C'mon the 'trailer is too long' ?! you can do better than that. 
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:32:58
cool! 
@_date: 2015-07-14 09:30:50
Yes. He's also in the film. there is a short interview snippet. the full interview with him is here: 
@_date: 2015-07-14 07:57:50
first they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then ... well never mind.   *tothemoon*
@_date: 2015-07-10 07:41:37
he's always spot on!
@_date: 2015-07-07 21:31:18
awesome tech! 
@_date: 2018-11-15 04:40:42
yes. [  has the QR codes. Same in the youtube videos like this one: [ 
@_date: 2016-05-28 03:00:15
good luck with that ...
@_date: 2015-02-25 05:09:58
I think it does. Banks don't hold cash (very little of it). their 'money' is just numbers, digits in a database. If the banks claim it is costly to store these deposits - in other words to change digits in their computer systems - that's nonsense. These types of banking fees are the exact reason why Bitcoin (also a digital ledger, but global and distributed) are superior to the traditional financial system.

i voted for 2 designs
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:08:51
yes that was weird and wrong and weird
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:45:47
Without a doubt CoinJar has been one of the most innovative Bitcoin companies in the world. Their card. The Finovate Award. The Hedged Accounts. Yes, I have also double checked their security protocols. They have hired an IT security expert who spoke at a Melbourne event not long ago. 
@_date: 2015-02-28 13:34:00
sorry can you expand on this? 
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:48:19
For convenience it might be ok to have small amounts with third party wallets so that you can use them more easily. Companies like CoinJar, Coinbase, etc. have been innovating some new services which will make Bitcoin easier to use - hopefully bringing Crypto more mainstream...
But Yes. If you don't want to get Goxxed, keep 90%+ of your Bitcoin holdings in a wallet that you control.  
@_date: 2015-02-20 13:10:24
but its a good start for more balanced and fair media exposure
@_date: 2015-02-28 12:20:00
great talk. thanks for posting 
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:11:42
Did Bruce pull out of the race or why can't you guys/gals vote for him?
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:30:13
upvoted. agreed. it's a good thing. 
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:13:52
great idea
@_date: 2015-02-28 07:26:04
the more I hear about Russia, .... 
@_date: 2015-02-18 00:30:25
@_date: 2015-02-25 12:10:38
sorry for sounding like a smart ass here, but if they send a survey monkey email to all eligible voters with multiple choice allowed and unique ID to prevent double voting, wouldn't that be better than what they are doing now? It literally takes 2 minutes to set up. 
On a different note: 4 votes. 4 candidates. ??
