Pretty sure Satoshi is Nick Szabo.  Satoshi cannot be dead because Satoshi has communicated from Satoshi’s account recently to say Dorian Nakamoto is not him.  
He probably hasn’t spent bitcoins because it would take credibility from the currency and make it look like a ponzi.

Why spend so much money on a depreciating asset like that when you can spend money to help the world?  Buying a Porsche is not impressive.

Good idea Randall, but consider doing more white papers than cryptocurrencies.

Sorry I guess there isn’t proof.  Maybe the account was hacked.  But Finney did use bitcoins to pay for ALS treatment.

If it started under Clinton at -255 billion in 1993 and finished in 2001 at +128 billion (surplus), did it go up or down?
If it started under Obama at -1.4 trillion in 2009 and finished at -665 billion in 2017, did it go up or down?

How are you using the term expensive?  I’m talking about electricity usage.  
@_date: 2019-11-14 00:08:46
Don't you realize that my statements are compatible with this?  The budget deficit can fall as the national debt rises.  In fact, as long as there is a budget deficit, the national debt rises.  But it's wrong to attribute the rise in national debt to Obama when the budget deficit fell during his administration.  More accurate to attribute it to GW Bush, who preceded him and who dramatically increased the budget deficit.
@_date: 2019-03-07 14:31:58
I mean, increasing in terms of electric usage.  
I did not suggest that it has not come up.  
@_date: 2019-11-09 03:52:42
So it was difficult to withdraw up until a year ago, but it changed?

Cause of Trump.  The deficit was shrinking under Obama and Clinton and soaring under Reagan, GWBush and Trump—a direct consequence of the tax policy during their administrations.
@_date: 2019-11-14 01:02:56
Not true.  A president can't reduce the deficit so rapidly that it would crush the economy, especially as delicate as the economy was in Obama's first few years.  It was a feat that the budget deficit was reduced during his administration, even though he took over during a recession.  If we'd had another 8 years of Obama, we'd have a surplus, and the national debt would be reduced.  There is no economic sophistication in your remarks.

So what explains the comments in this thread?   [

But isn't it true that with each transaction, the blockchain gets longer?  Therefore, it takes more electric energy to process?

But when you are rich, don’t assume that all or most of the poor lack intelligence or a strong work ethic.
@_date: 2019-06-22 01:36:19
I envy you people who can pursue riches without feeling obligated to work to make the world better.  The most profound contributions to the world are not well monetized.  Darwin, Newton, Fisher, Hamilton, de Grey.  
If I had money, I’d put it into bitcoin but I don’t because of the above, so I’m frustrated with every thousand bitcoin increases.  And that will continue.
@_date: 2019-06-23 02:58:48
The point:  Newton did not become wealthy through his work.  Neither did Darwin.
@_date: 2019-06-23 03:48:28
Anyway, how is de grey a crank?
@_date: 2019-06-22 02:12:08
I already have.
@_date: 2019-06-22 08:10:34
Darwin and Newton would not have been interested in a bitcoin thread?  
I actually did not claim a discovery of the order of theirs.  They are just the most visible examples of not being paid for revolutionary work.  Or being paid meager.
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:16:46
What are you asking ?
@_date: 2019-04-03 23:18:27
Have you used Next exchange?
@_date: 2019-09-27 17:22:46
How are you using leverage to trade bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-24 20:25:37
I’m guessing it’s google’s quantum computer.

Left tackle is the 2nd most important position on the field.  Big mistake the Seahawks made letting him go.

Don't you want it to stay down so that you can get more money into it?  
Talk of resistance level is B.S.  The idea that the price of a coin can be expected to go down because it did at this price a few months ago  is so flimsy.
