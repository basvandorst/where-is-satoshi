What do you mean "there is no way to withdraw". That cant be true, otherwise it would be a well known scam and plain theft.

Thanks for clarifying, I got scared for a moment as I only just added money there :P
Just copying 2 people at first.

Actually I assume you mean we can't withdraw in bitcoin for example, and that it all gets converted to normal money.

Are any of them recommended or do you consider them all a scam like eToro? He has some time and the whole copying others thing seems like a nice concept to learn the game. As well as an investment he wants a hobby- an interactive trading platform in one package. Otherwise, I shall just tell him to do like the rest of us.

I think that is a great idea as it looks very featured and won't have the limitations of the platforms like eToro. Thanks.

They aren't open about their fees. For example, withdrawals cost $25. That's not the issue (even though it isn't cheap). The issue is they do not tell you until you have committed to the withdrawal. I did 2 in quick succession, which made me feel scammed. 
They also don't tell you that each crypto trade minimum investment is $250. Some of the smaller cryptos you may just want to have a little try with, I have done that with a few cryptos. I don't like being told how much I have to spend. They have a very limited number of cryptos too.
There are also delays when making trades or copying people. 
It is much easier to use a proper exchange where you can buy what you want when you want. But I like the idea so would love something legit.
