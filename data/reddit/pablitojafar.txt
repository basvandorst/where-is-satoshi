I thought the ledger only let you make one pass phrased pin... you’re saying you can make unlimited?

Ah makes sense, just read it, thanks for the info. 
I personally prefer Trezor’s passphrase feature more as it’s much easier, however runs the risk of keyloggers. 
I believe their new trezor T will allow the user to input directly onto the device instead of using a keyboard.

Bcash- forked shitcoin with more 0-days left to find. They are lucky the core dev graciously disclosed the 0-day to them.

I see. How would one connect back to those temporary passphrase wallets they made if they already have two pins?

Sorry for the loss man!  When 80% of all bcash is coming from one Korean exchange you know it's a clear pump.

The asymmetrical risk is strong with crypto you say

It is still young.. did we have a bitcoin debit card 1.5 years after Satoshi's release?  
One thing ETH has that BTC didn't, is the backing of companies with godlike market caps (whether using ETH public chain or not).  Whether they contribute with code to EEA or not is one question, however it definitely is causing new investors into the market versus bitcoin because bitcoin doesn't have any of these big names backing a currency made by an anonymous creator (and whose reputation to the common person is drug money/hack money) *Disclaimer* I own BTC and ETH, just my opinion

Another defense mechanism for those of you have coin's on exchanges, have the exchange whitelist your hardware wallet as the only address you can send coin too.   That in itself would have made your account secure even if passwords comprised, the hacker could only send to your Trezor wallet.

It does if you want it to. Regardless, if your trezor address is the only address whitelisted, then even if your account is comprised, the hacker can only send to your trezor (whichever address you select)

You are correct.  Any sane investor wouldn't trade his most profitable coin for a coin that has this much uncertainty before Aug 1.  Only a gambler does that.  
Will BTC probably be fine after Aug 1st? Probably. Smart decision to put all your eggs in one?  Nope
While I have traded some of my BTC for other alt-coins, I still have 20+ to keep no matter what happens.  Just my thoughts-
