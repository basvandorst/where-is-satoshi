It's likely that some of their investors own some kind of priority shares in the company = they get paid back before everyone else, in the event of any kind of winding down or exit, possibly at some multiple of the original amount they put in.
Assets are almost never distributed evenly in any kind of startup exit. There tend to be priorities of who gets money first, even if that means that some parties get no money.

On one hand, I always distrust these ultra flashy sites that use all the latest graphics design fluff.
On the other hand, you automatically believe the bank when they flag something as suspicious activity? You realize that those systems tend to error on the side of caution, right?

I see. That's clearly not good.

Fuck that. "Transparency" is usual excuse for the terrible business and banking laws through out the EU. Companies constantly getting harassed and having to justify every little transaction to random authorities.
How the fuck is this upvoted so high? No one deserves privacy because of "transparency"?

Do you think the swearing is directed at pieces of code, or are people interpreting the swearing to be directed at people? Just curious, I never read the list.

Friends, family and spouses are NOT the people to rely on for investment advice. Always a bad idea.

Which is great that he's so pro-active in investing in Bitcoin companies. These failures though, they're inherent in hardware startups. Most investors REFUSE to touch technology hardware startups at all. 
Personally, I wouldn't consider hardware startups a good investment and I'm not surprised, at all, that the mentioned hardware startups failed. Hardware startups, as a class, are WELL KNOWN to have extremely high overruns and delays relating to hardware issues. It's not surprising that most investors avoid them.
I used to work in ASIC design... the only guarantee in that business is that the first few runs will spectacularly fail, for some marginal reason. The simulators are terrible, the fabrication plants are terrible, everything is terrible.
The extremely rapid pace that hardware is outdated in Bitcoin --combined-- with the dangers of delays and overruns inherent to hardware startups = near guaranteed failure.

Publicly gathering information -- that's exactly the terrible part I'm talking about. Individuals can be smart... mobs are terrifying and dumb.

He's clearly talking about what traders call market price, even though he uses a different word.

I usually never consider "looking nice" to be an important feature, but that sure does look nice.

Not exactly the same, Bittorrent just needs any small percentage of the nodes to be sending data that correctly matches the hash in the torrent. The data hash is totally pre-defined. Roughly speaking, Bitcoin needs the majority of the nodes to continuously arrive at a consensus of what the latest data is. Much more attackable, in that respect.

Most bittorrent clients, by default, force you to run the equivalent of a full node, and by default you will continue to run the equivalent of a full node after your download completes, until you manually stop it.
No one does seed most torrents, except the extremely popular ones, or a few nodes from the initial uploader who's trying to get a torrent to take off in popularity. Most torrent sites only show you the torrents that are popular, not the ones with 0 seeds.

Free countries don't require a license before doing business, unfortunately not a lot of countries are free in that respect.
