Because a dollar on Mt. Gox is not actually *worth* as much as a dollar on coinbase.
Explanation: Actually withdrawing your dollars from Gox takes a very long time.

In the UK, they are. It's easy to get a bank account for free here, and contactless is a fantastic way to pay. Look it up

not really necessary.
Your miner effectively generates 'lottery tickets' - the better your miner the more lottery tickets it can make and therefor the higher chance of 'winning', each block has a winning ticket - and the winner gets credited that BTC.
In merged mining, your lottery tickets are submitted to the BitCoin blockchain and the merged alt coin blockchain. Therefore you have chances at winning two lotteries from the same amount of work.

I believe that there is a technical drop in hash rate but it is miniscule and the merged coin generated will more than make up for it.

Picture it like this, if the UK had a national lottery and the US had a national lottery, and it was possible to buy one ticket that is valid in both draws.
That would be like merged mining.
