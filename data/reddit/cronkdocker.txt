whats the point? awareness...
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:09:02
oh thats a real intelligent answer, innocent until proven guilty right... yes conceptually that is great for the individual, but when its BILLION DOLLAR FRAUD!!!!! there should be some due diligence.
also...something something financial institutions are legally responsible for regular audits. something something you fucking idiot.
@_date: 2018-01-24 05:30:56
any normal financial institution opens its doors for regular audits, why the fuck would you give a pass to something that essentially has the capacity to commit fraud on the level that is currently being accused.

god dont even worry about it mate, seriously...some sheeple just don't want to listen.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:09:25
you are an idiot.

wait but if we use segwit send money to a non segwit address, isnt there an attack vector? I vaguely remember reading that miners could do some nifty shit and essentially steal all segwit transaction coins or was it all non segwit?

hasnt coinbase already started trading bch?

I agree expect I think votes should be per address regardless of how much someone owns otherwise you will run into the same issues with a few billionaires having a majority vote...which again is basically centralised decision making

interesting...is bitcoin a company or an idea? who owns the idea? is the idea the code itself? if its the code itself?....hmmm I dont know, I dont have an answer to this. 
Edit - Not trying to vouch for Roger Ver...Just trying to outline bitcoin's current identity crises...hopefully all this shit blows over and we can figure out how to agree on shit without all this forking nonsense, and also having a clear definition of what bitcoin is would be nice I guess...is it blockstream, is it the code the core devs work on, is it the people that mine it...or is it the nodes that believe in it?
Edit 2 - Putting Philosophy aside here, the current version of the bitcoin coin itself should link to the organisation responsible for the current traded version...regardless of the fact that it itself is not the original *bitcoin project* (should you believe that)
@_date: 2017-11-11 03:22:26
if we are looking at bitcoin as a company sure, but then again without regulation its just calling for insider trading...
if you want to think of bitcoin as an ecosystem, or a new governance system weighted voting power is not the solution.

how illiterate are you? yet somehow so aware of whats going on? damn these intelligent 12 year olds.

Most importantly

You obviously are not familiar with humanity inherent nature to be greedy and thus vote for this to further benefit themselves in their immediate lifetime not the ecosystem, I doubt any 1 person would want to bother spending any sort of time spitting their 100000 bitcoins into 100000 wallets for the purpose of a vote, a better mechanism would be 1 vote per address with a minimum stake of 1 coin. That would ensure the majority get a fair vote.
Would you think it's fair if companies got 2000 votes in a state election because they have more economical worth than 1 employee or one citizen?

gold and oil. hello Venezuela petro ICO...lol 
@_date: 2018-02-05 04:53:18
you ruined this.
@_date: 2017-10-25 23:57:06
Well... not really its a non-profit foundation, and we are simply seeking advice on the possibilities of an ICO, TBH we may not go down that route and simply use a donation based model for funding campaigns.
