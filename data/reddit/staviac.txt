"Bitcoin Fabulous" hahahaha
@_date: 2016-04-01 08:51:22
wow "several weeks" is a long time 
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:25:06
Finally !
@_date: 2016-04-21 22:07:13
Nice 
@_date: 2018-01-04 16:32:51
@_date: 2017-12-22 09:23:59
not a very technical answer :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 09:34:35
you guys know that not even core has full wallet support for segwit right ? (it will come with core 0.16 probably)
@_date: 2017-12-15 19:51:56
Of course, why wouldn't you wait on a free well tested and stable version provided by the best devs in the ecosystem ?
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:59:12
i ll add xrp which is the fastest and the most usable at this point
@_date: 2017-12-06 01:22:41
With no bitcoin, i think Andreas has more authority when he talks to outsider of the ecosystem. (whereas roger could be accused of pumping a currency for his own profit)
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:16:36
In the meantime, 61 banks will try ripple
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:01
What the hell, this comment shows that you don't know what mtgox was, you don't know what coinbase is and may be you don't know what "turning into" means.
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:26:17
It's not about the monney
@_date: 2017-12-03 22:25:43
if bitcoin is used to buy this "PetrolCoin" as way to bypass sanction of USA. The regulation storm will come quicker than expected
@_date: 2017-12-13 01:28:39
You lost your monney the moment you let someone else be in charge of your private key
@_date: 2017-12-18 14:21:31
the term "moving off-line" isn't quite correct, i think he meant "sending off-line"
@_date: 2017-12-27 01:28:51


should have been the only thing to work on since the fork
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:57:57
Even core doesn't support Segwit so .. yes they have the excuse of waiting on the core implementation 
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:21:24
Even core doesn't fully support segwit yet ..

technical question here:
What is the routing algorithm used by a node to find the best path ? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:18:43
i know but we can't blame coinbase to not implement it when core hasn't fully supported yet
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:21:24
When you open a channel you "kind of" send your coin on a adress where you AND the receiver need to agree to move it again.
@_date: 2017-12-21 16:51:53
this cracked me up 
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:03:11
Exchanges are waiting on the stable version of core
@_date: 2017-12-13 11:39:52
Localbitcoin is an exchange. Buying from an exchange is ok, letting them own your keys is not. 
@_date: 2017-12-13 09:35:23
You can let it just the time of the transaction. I use localbitcoin then cold or sorfware wallet. When to buy some alt i use shapeshift
@_date: 2017-12-15 01:14:56
They are waiting on Core to release a full wallet support for segwit
@_date: 2017-12-19 14:46:10
not our problem if you have low standard
@_date: 2017-12-06 11:02:00
Which one ?
@_date: 2017-12-04 20:06:08
@_date: 2017-12-15 20:24:02
You can't blame them, even core hasn't release a wallet that fully support it
@_date: 2017-12-10 22:55:08
The coin is locked, a lot of off chain transactions happen. When the channel is closed, the coin get released and settle the transactions.
On chain transation: Open channel: 0.1 btc send A to B (but 0.1 locked)
Off chain transaction: 0.01 btc send B to A
Off chain transaction: 0.01 btc send B to A
Off chain transaction: 0.01 btc send B to A
On chain transaction: close channel  
0.097 goes to B
0.03 goes to A
@_date: 2017-12-07 08:47:35
full wallet support for segwit isn't even implemented by core so ..
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:29:17
No its a normal bitcoin multisig adresse
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:30:37
We tried a 100 time, nobody follows and it add more confusion for new comers
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:57:00
it's not my point. The moment core release it, it gets available to anyone who want to implement it so why would you take time / monney / ressources for something that will come for free. 
Good on BitStamp if they did it but i don't blame coinbase to wait for a stable and reliable version from core
@_date: 2017-12-15 23:26:05
I don't agree on this one, they have done their job providing bitcoin to the adverge jo. Core should have release the wallet the same day the fork happend
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:46:06
My english is that bad ?
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:53:53
I m talking about similar situation to what we expect to happen for crypto. But this is backed by all the bank, is advertised everywhere and have no competition. How do you expect crypto to become mainstream if this can’t ?
@_date: 2018-06-19 21:39:06
i ll also add that they have also the biggest credit card terminal provider of the country with them. Merchant just have to send a email to activate it on the device they already use everyday to accept payement.
The only 2 competitors are applepay and android wallet

best time to buy was 5 years ago, second best time to buy is now

note: 2x has been canceled since this article so i m not sure if they still plan to sell the 173,014 BCH
@_date: 2017-11-08 17:51:08
Don't let your bitcoin on any exchange. use a software wallet (exodus) or a hardware wallet (keepkey/tresor/ledger)
@_date: 2017-11-21 17:34:19
I didn't realise i was taking to a core dev. Thank for your time to answer question and involvement in Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:18:07
it depends how much you earn for what you lock, how much does it cost to run a node...
@_date: 2017-11-21 01:20:20
use ai resistant encryption ?
@_date: 2017-11-21 21:56:12
Yes that's right but i m also interest in the "design" and technical point. I thought that hub (like node on the btc network) were really NEEDED and in that point the answer he provided helped me to understand a bit better the LN network in the best case scenario.
I also aware that core may not be the best to talk about economic result that why i didn't carry on.
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:09:12
No im talking about the node needed to form a network
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:56:52
I can't gives you a proper explanation but you need to open channel in order to make LN txs. The idea isn't to open new channel with anyone you want to transact with but to create a network where transaction can go from user X to user Z through user Y (so X don't need to connect to Z). If we want this use case to be possible to work Y need to have coins "locked" to let users transact through him. I m calling the user Y a hub/node
@_date: 2017-11-16 12:49:35
If i were them i ll sell it and keep the change. Its not not your private key it their. They have no obligation about forks.
We said it 1000 time, if you do not hold the keys, it not your bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 03:06:11
Ok i understand a bit better thanks
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:24:41
They said they keep half of what their costumers spend on Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-21 02:05:26
You got lucky on this dip that's it
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:28:11
When will 0.16 be released ? 
@_date: 2017-11-20 00:38:07
Drop jaxx and use exodus
@_date: 2018-03-16 00:17:47
We are going down for a couple of years like last time
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:33:43
It more important that bitcoin get rock solid by getting through this now and not when it's mainstream. Every people that invest in bitcoin know that it's risky. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:36:10
Yeah you are right replay attack hurt if you want to use both. 
But i m view i see it in a way that it force owner to choose which one of the implementation is the right one and help one side to win. But you still have the choice to not make a choice by not moving your coin.
For me a fork in bitcoin shouldnt be different that a fork in another IT project.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:21:33
That the problem: Fork is not about getting free monney 
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:41:25
If they use an other implementation, they are not "your user".
Ok done
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:24:13
It depends how you see it. If you care about only one chain no its not. My coin may has been move in the bitcoin unlimited or bitcoin xt. I dont even know if those chain had replay protection but i dont care. 
If you care about the other chain because you may want to use / sell those coin (and by doing this giving it value / importance) then yes it's bad.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:15:04
That's why they are vulnerable to replay attack
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:12:05
i m aware of that but competition will make the best chain win so the value of one chain will go up and the other chain go down. 
If you choose to move your coin in one chain in my view it means you bet on the one you use.
In your case the best is to wait and choose later when one of the chain win.
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:18:22
I can understand that but i feel like a lot people mislead "fork" with "getting free monney". 
The only reason people care about replay attack is because without protection they risk their coin by transfering the value from one chain to the other.
Fork is not about getting free monney 
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:09:03
Ok i mean this topic isn't about what i want to happen but more about what will happen. 
My guess is no side in the next fork will implement the replay protection.
So instead of having conversation about who the hell is the bad guy in this "fork gate" i prefer to think a bit ahead and discuses about what does it mean to move coin in one side when there is no replay protection.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:20:29
Not my game, and not what i wish but what will happen. 
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:42:20
I know what replay attack is but you .. do you know what a hard fork is ? (The concept of it)
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:08:00
It matters only if you intend to use both chain
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:19:11
It s not about the monney it about which bitcoin implementation is the best.
@_date: 2017-10-11 22:28:47
The fact that no side will implement replay protection doesn't let us the choice to think that way
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:24:06
Ok fork is not about getting free monney it's about choosing the best implementation of bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:30:54
How can you building replay protection if you are a business ? I mean went you send your transaction its broadcasted in the whole network isnt it ?    
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:17:15
Again the point i make is about choosing a side. If you choose one side then you shouldnt care what happen on the other side. 
If you don't want to choose then fine .. dont move your coin and wait for a side to win.
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:37:59
Not if you decide to play it safe and not choose a side and wait for one side win
@_date: 2017-10-18 07:05:49
Don't put your all your coin in your smartphone. Use a hardware / paper wallet instead.
@_date: 2017-10-11 21:11:28
But the problem is you can't force one side to  implement replay protection
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:09:00
In that case you use both chain
@_date: 2017-10-11 17:00:53
Yeah and my point is it only matters if you care (and you shoudn't) about some coin moving in an other chain (you are not supporting anyway)
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:13:21
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:45:26
Not if you dont choose and wait for one side to "die"
@_date: 2017-10-11 20:40:07
I m taking about fork and implementation .. not about getting free monney by using "replay protection"
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:54:23
Thank you for this complet  answer
@_date: 2017-05-21 23:46:46
Is there any other way / proposal to fix malleability ?
@_date: 2017-06-19 20:50:02
1. they provided a solution (miner didn't like it)
2. coding skills has nothing to do with "political" choice
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:00:47


@_date: 2017-06-13 12:23:47
ivan on teck made a video about it 
@_date: 2017-06-19 21:36:45
What i meant is : yes they can be "suck good programmers" even though you think they didn't provide a right solution to solve a problem.
