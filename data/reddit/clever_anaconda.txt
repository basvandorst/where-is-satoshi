Now, if this happened in the model would then walk over to the guy and show him how to properly use his token wallet!

I haven't posted it yet, because it's not done yet. I definitely will once it's done. This piece is somewhat meta, which I'm thinking is going to stay pretty common in the community for a while yet, until it's even more mainstream.

I've [done that]( recently, which has worked out well so far (continuing discussions with the artist; should have something to show for it in the near future).

Are there any wallets out there for Android that enable *receiving* Lightning payments? I tried Eclair, but it only lets you send, not receive. The only one I can find that does is BTCPay, but that requires your own server or something?

For a long while, the Bitcoin and cryptocurrency space has long used "trust in numbers" (_vires in numeris_) as a motto, but while some abstract concepts like "Justice" have had a human personification for a while, "numbers" hasn't really had a personification to look to. And so, a few months ago, I set out to change that, to give "Math" and "Cryptography" a bit of a more sexy appearance to relate to. And so, drawing on some of the more modern personifications like "Earth-Chan" or "Wikipe-tan", I [put out a call]( to find an artist, and with the help of of [Bad Moon Art]( got the ideas out of my head and into pixels.
And so, this is the final result; "Math", and her daughter, "Cryptography", for your enjoyment!
Because the intent of these pieces is to be a "canonical" starting point for others to use this character concept for further works, **these pieces are being released under a Creative Commons Zero (CC0) "No Rights Reserved" license, putting them in the public domain**. There's several versions of these characters available [on IPFS]( including transparent background, and versions of them with their hands up, as if to hold something (I'm guessing it wouldn't be too hard for other artists supporting different cryptocurrencies to drop in the logo of their coin onto their hand, as an easy way to create some promotional pieces with these characters). So, if you like them, feel free to use them! And let everyone know that when you say you're placing your trust in Math, let them know who's piercing blue eyes you're actually placing it in!

No NSFW version in this commission, but that might be an interesting marketing campaign for Bitcoin if someone created that!

I'm not a developer; is there a compiled app that can do that at this point for Lightning? I tried the Eclair wallet on my phone, but that only looks like it has buttons for sending payments, not generating invoices.

Well, that's fun! So, now I have a few satoshi's in a custodial Lightning wallet. And while that tip bot has the option to withdraw, the way you withdraw is to another Lightning wallet (need to generate an invoice), which is the thing Eclair cannot do. So, I can bounce those 5,000 satoshis around Reddit, or send them to a merchant who has a receiving service set up?
