I could implement this - but I do have a day job and family so it would take a while.  However I'm happy to be part of a group talking about the details.  For a POC we would need:
* an RFC style spec of the interactions.
* a web server module that allowed simple configuration of the payment requirements for given resources - similar to the authentication module in apache.  This might be simpler in nodejs.
* a client side library that responds to the payment request by either showing a local UI or uses a local bitcoin wallet. 
* both client and server would want access to a library implementing the bitcoin protocol and hashes etc. 
That last could be handled by running bitcoind on the server and using the RPC API but you would probably want something more compact for client side use. 
the challenge post video below does cover the same idea. But I can't see on that page any links to software or specifications.  
A starting point would simply be to get some agreement on the protocol specification and interactions.  
For example : the client must create a payment transaction to the requested address - does the server simply watch for that address on the blockchain or should the client put the transaction id in the header of the request.   As with authentication clients sometimes know in advance what they are required to so so can skip the first 402 exchange and just make a valid request containing a payment transaction id. 
When is the server response sent?  A server side policy will be required as to whether the resource will be delivered once the tx is in the blockchain or only after it has received some confirmations.  
While I've been in BTC for some time this is my first head above the parapet as regards the software level and would like to know where is the best place to discuss such issues?
