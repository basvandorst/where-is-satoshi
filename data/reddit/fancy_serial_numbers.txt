So the max you can earn on your capital is 0.03% or slow down inflation this much if you save?  Where do you live if you don't mind sharing?
@_date: 2019-07-16 16:41:31
Exactly.  On the surface it looks like a legitimate (free) system.  The Central Banks had an ingenious plan because most people think they are free when the entire system around them is based on debt.  It is so hard to escape.  They make it this way on purpose (student loans, crazy medical bills, cost of living going up due to inflation and target rates to keep that money moving).  If you save your money and don't move it you are penalized for not moving that capital by it losing its value over time due to so much new money being injected into the system.  The bankers solved one issue.  They save money on housing the slaves, shackling the slaves (no iron balls or handcufffs) and they don't have to buy any slave ships.  A win-win.

They are going to do two things and the people will eat it up like candy:   Cashless (full control), and negative interest rates to keep this fake economy going.  Very few people actually own anything.  Especially in debt-ridden nations.  To keep the fake (and unrealistic and harmful to the environment) growth they have to encourage people to spend.  No longer encourage people to be frugal or save (this empowers people to be debt free and own something like a car or house).

They never have to get a job in their lives and can even claim basic minimum pension when they retire from sitting on their asses after decades of robbing the system blind.
