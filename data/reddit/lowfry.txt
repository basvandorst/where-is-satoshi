Nice shill, but you ain't fooling anyone.

Modern browsers like Firefox use DoH by default, which allows resolving the IP without revealing the resolution request to any third party. Since the TLS connection is between the TCP and HTTP layer, the client first establishes an encrypted TCP (via the TLS protocol) connection between them and the server, and then sends the HTTP traffic over that encrypted tunnel.
I hope you understand this dumbed down version as you don't seem to have much experience regarding cryptography and how the web works. If you wanna learn more you should check out RFC 8446.

Yes, Craig is a fucking joke. And tbh I belive that Satoshi is already dead, most signs point into Finney's direction.
Finney was the only one of three who replied something positive in Metzowd's mailing list (the mailing list were Satoshi initially released the first information about bitcoin), he was involved into several electronic cash projects before and then he was the first recipient of the first bitcoin transaction ever.
Finney was most likely Satoshi, and he's been dead for years already. I wish he could see how big bitcoin is today.

Imo the most probable risk is the SHA256 hashing algorithm getting owned by quantum computing.

Can't be, as the page uses transport layer security. The transport layer is layer 4, therefore even the URL is encrypted.

I'm saying that you get more hash power for the same expenses (electricity) compared to core. Yes, asic boost is still a thing on bch, as this blockchain explorer reveals: 
Bitcoin cash's development is mostly driven by big mining companies (but kinda dead anyway).

Eh, there are so many other registrars which allow bitcoin purchases without bitpay, such as  and

I wouldn't say that coinbase commerce is worse than bitpay, however I'm biased as we use it at our company. We've used coinpayments in the past, however coinbase allows you to use their service without providing them any private keys and therefore is the better choice. Everything just goes straight into our pockets without additional fees.

Actually you and u/blockparty_sh are right and my comment was quite misleading and in fact wrong as SegWit does not prevent asicboost completely. I'd recommend reading the 2nd post of this bitcointalk thread as I cannot explain it better: 
Didn't know this either tbh

Coinbase commerce allows us to use our own wallet. Cb commerce is different from the "normal" coinbase tho.

Idk why no one mentions this but in fact bitcoin cash was created because SegWit mitigated a known weakness in mining which allowed &lt;a specific ASIC manufacturer&gt; to mine coins 20% faster. The technique was called "asic boost". (might want to check the bitcoin core mailing list: 
That's also why &lt;a specific ASIC manufacturer&gt; pushed development of bitcoin cash products (new full node software, clients in "trending" languages like rust &amp; go, etc) so much.
Basically bitcoin cash is just the Chinese bitcoin (with poor quality code). If you are not a miner there is no point in supporting bch.
Edit: comment is misleading, segwit doesn't prevent asicboost. Read this:

12.6 Million USD per day is nothing for a market which is worth 150 BN.

Can you back up this statement that address reuse "ruins quantum resistance"?
@_date: 2019-09-25 16:03:49
You don't get the public key without breaking SHA256, since v1 addresses =
base58(version byte + ripemd160(sha256(ecdsa public key)) + substring(sha256(sha256(version byte + ripemd160(sha256(ecdsa public key)))), 1, 4))

Maybe because this thread is about Portugal and not about the US?
@_date: 2019-09-25 23:27:24
It is an additional step as I assumed that you still need to derive the public key from the address first. Usually you only have a single address of a target, and not their public key for that address.
