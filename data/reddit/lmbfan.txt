I didn't read every comment so this may have been posted already, but you can NOT trade wow gold for real world items, and the virtual stuff you can buy is limited.
You trade gold for "battle.net balance" not for USD.  While you can buy some things with this currency, including game time and virtual pets, you cannot buy things in the "gear store," which only sells real world goods like tshirts and plushies.  I am not a lawyer but I have the suspicion that this is precisely to avoid legal issues related to taxes.  You also cannot refund battle.net balance to a bank account or credit card or anything useful. You are basically locked into the Blizzard shop, and only for virtual goods.
I don't know about going against the ToS and Ebay-ing gold, I'll leave that to others more knowledgeable than myself.

Taxes. 401(k). Medical insurance. Life insurance. Wage garnishment.  These are some of the reasons employers outsource payroll, not ease of use.  It's super easy to pay cash under the table if you want to avoid taxes &amp; such,  much easier than getting someone set up with bitcoin if they never heard of it before.

Ok, extend your example. Bitstamp gets DDOSed. What happens to the 5 BTC that MtGox tries to redeem? And who pays the XRP? Bitstamp, MtGox, Anne, Mark, Jeffrey? If one of the latter 3, does that mean if the don't own any, they can't use ripple? Where would any of them acquire XRP assuming they weren't around when the XRP were originally given away for free? Just trying to understand.

You are off by a factor of 10.  6.2 cents rather than 62 cents.

It's called arbitrage and it is a perfectly valid way to make a profit.  Don't forget transmission times in your calculations, bitcoins move quickly but USD can take days.

Well sure, the share that finds the coins can't be valid for both pools, but what I wonder is why I can't find hundreds of difficulty 1 shares and submit them to multiple pools.  I am pretty sure it's not possible to do so, but I don't know why.  The pools are trying to find the same number of 0's at the beginning of the hash, and the history is the same, so work done on one pool should translate to the others, do y'all catch my drift?

Two questions.
How old and what size does an amount in my wallet have to be to avoid the .0005 fee?  I am using bitcoind client.
What prevents a miner from finding shares from two pools using the same calculation?
