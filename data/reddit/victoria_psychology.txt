Do you truly think that someone’s death will make your life easier or better? Is it easier for you to shift the responsibility for your life and well-being to someone else than to take full responsibility?

Glad to hear that! I'm not begging, I'm ready to help for free.
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:37:27
Yes, I posted there, because maybe someone needs help there too. and yes, I will be pleased if someone sends thanks.

You can continue to revel in your hatred and live in it. Wars are sponsored not only by bankers. Bankers simply follow orders and you know it very well. You also know that they will not die just like that, and the system will continue to work, no matter how rotten it is. You can assume that now you are something higher or better than me, but this will be just a lesson to me not go where no one is waiting. Goodbye.

Probably it was a bad idea. You did not understand me. But it's okay, this is also an experience. No one appreciates something that is offered for free.

Now it became clear to me. Thanks for your explanation. Where I come from people speak openly about their problems. so I just change the landmark and delete this topic.

I had no such thoughts. and I can’t even imagine how it can be used. but it doesn’t matter anymore.

Different people have different priorities in life. Someone considers war to be evil. Do you think war is evil?

Why are you so worried about their death?
@_date: 2019-11-15 17:54:03
You are welcome to do what you want. Have a nice evening!

It’s wonderful that you are doing fine. But maybe there are people to whom it may be useful. And when I need help, I take care of myself and turn to it.

Well talking about crypto won't save you from children, trust me :-) Nevertheless, kids are a happy thing.

You probably misunderstood me. I wanted to help if you have any questions in your life or something else. And no, I'm just Bitcoin noob :-)
