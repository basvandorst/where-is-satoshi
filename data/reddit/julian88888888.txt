Brutal! Nice find.
@_date: 2015-04-29 15:19:04
Is there anywhere you couldn't make that work?!
@_date: 2015-11-03 18:06:29
where can you short BTC?
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:22:35
Although for selling it's actually pretty good.
@_date: 2015-11-20 19:17:08
Yea, it's pretty stupid. It's about .01% cheaper to just use coinbase anyway.
@_date: 2015-11-20 17:14:17
1. Buy from circle.com (no fee)
2. transfer to coinbase
3. use card?
I guess it makes it easier for people buy things using only bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-11-21 12:37:00
Yes, though selling on them has made it up for me.

`You will be quoted one competitive bid/ask price for buys, sells, and currency conversions. The exchange rate for bitcoin to dollar goes up and down based on the market for buying and selling bitcoin. At Circle, we determine a single competitive buy/sell price for our customers. We arrive at this price by aggregating data from a range of leading exchanges. There is no spread on these smaller purchases, sales, or conversions.`
`If you are buying, selling, or converting larger amounts, you may be subject to a higher buy price or a lower sell price than you would usually see for smaller amounts. The buy or sell price will be quoted to you before you complete the purchase, sale, or conversion. Keep in mind that Circle will still not charge a fee on top of this spread, and the quoted rate at the time of purchase will be the rate that you receive.`

It would be nice if there was a time for those who work full-time

Same-thing happened to me, they white-listed my first (1btc) transaction after removing it.
@_date: 2013-04-25 04:31:32
I can confirm this.
@_date: 2013-07-17 18:25:32
Are there any plans to hook-up to Coinbase's API?
@_date: 2013-05-28 21:35:14
What can happen in the future impacts what will happen in the near future.

Olaf helped me out when Coinbase was being lame (marking my transactions as high-risk), I like Olaf….

Match? More like blatant ripoff. Bitcoin is different from paypal in a big way, it doesn't have to look identical.
@_date: 2013-05-12 13:09:54
I hate to be so cynical, but with a 1 day old account, I can't help but be skeptical.
@_date: 2013-04-25 03:58:45
I always trust 1 day old accounts for my financial advice.
@_date: 2013-05-12 17:26:35
how do you measure that?
@_date: 2013-04-19 16:58:01
Will you explain on the github? or in the sub-reddit? I'm not a developer myself, but I'm sure your elaboration will be welcomed there.
@_date: 2013-04-14 19:41:59
I'm more annoyed because I subscribed for content, discussion, insights, etc. Yes it's great, but I wish there weren't several postings about it, it should be in one big posting IMO.
@_date: 2013-04-17 14:11:45
I don't like it, I subscribed for content, and yes it's great companies are accepting it, as time goes on I think it'll be too much noise.

Hello Julian.
@_date: 2013-04-19 15:47:32
come checkout [buttercoin]( which is an open-source project to create bitcoin exchanges.
@_date: 2013-04-12 13:54:58
why can't you disclose the details?
