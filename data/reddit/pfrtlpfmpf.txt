I´m not concerned by who legally owns them anyway, but who actually "c o n t r o l s" them to potentially influence the markets with it . . .

Yep, hilarious !  Makes one wonder, how he got to his age, without killing himself . . .   :)

Me too, but with a keygen from the interwebz again, i just can´t resist :)
Ok, ok, a hardwarewallet is high on my shopping-list.

Veracrypt is really great, but what has it to do with compression programs ?

It´s simple: When there will be quantum computing, not only the bad guys will have it, the good ones will have it at the same time.
So, no real threat there.

Ha, that´s funny: "official crypto" and "unofficial crypto"
Yeah, in the end it´s all about control.

I love it, thats immensely bullish for crypto awareness and adoption. Thank you very much.
But if they think, they can control crypto that way, they are wrong, because after they introduced crypto to even the lowest IQ noobs, people will learn quickly, that it is soo easy to store them themselfes on their mobile, even easier than hoarding cash under the mattress.
So, thank you banks, for taking the burden from us, to educate people. I love it.

Imagine, the new gold, that gets dug out of the ground every year, about 1% of all gold in the world, would become 0.5% (and even announced years before the fact) compared to the % which is traded on the market all the time. No real effect.
But still, i think people will try to frontrun the event and push the price up, just because so many of them think it will go up.
Like all Bitcoin-TA, self-fulfilling prophecy. So i buy now, to sell when the hype peaks, then buy back, and so on, riding the waves . . .
I love bitcoin, but it´s still traded for the wrong reasons, but that will change. Meanwile i´ll seize the trading opportunities of my lifetime.

Something, that i always wanted to know:
Is it even possible, that a file, which has clearly a movie (.avi, etc) or music (.mp3, etc) -ending, can do any harm to my computer at all ? ?
To open a file with any other ending, like .lnk from a dubious source does´nt even cross my mind anyway.
Am i therefore safe ?
@_date: 2019-01-19 05:15:10
Thank you for the links, but now i´m to afraid to open them :)   Are they safe ?

Yes, and that is where i can´t get my head around with the extremely deflationary Bitcoin. It only encourages to save, hodl, which hinders its actuall usage. Everybody is just speculating with it, and waiting for higher prices.
But for the moment that´s fine with me as well. And the deflationary pressure will get smaller, there will be less bitcoin mined, and less bitcoin lost (forgotten keys, etc), as prices go higher.

You know, you can buy fractions of a bitcoin . . .   ;)
