I wrote it down and moved apartments and either left it in old apartment or it got lost in transit.

@_date: 2018-01-07 18:35:54

Invested €300 December, have more than doubled my money. HODL, or take back my initial investment and let the rest run?
@_date: 2018-01-07 14:12:19
Unreal haha see you next year

Not a joke I’ve 0.01BTC in the wallet and can’t do anything. It’s on tails and I know my persistent storage password so can access wallet history etc, but can’t do anything with the BTC. 
@_date: 2018-01-07 13:33:11
Is there a way to set reminders for me to come back to this ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:01:39
Sounds very complicated don’t think I’ve the ability to do it but thanks anyway ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:56:46
Yeah think I have them within electrum 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:00:40
I get my coins from localbitcoins and then try to transfer to electrum 
@_date: 2018-01-16 23:56:45
Wait never thought of that thanks for the help!
@_date: 2018-01-18 10:42:48
Thank you �� 
@_date: 2018-01-05 15:04:55
But what about when I’m transferring from electrum to electrum ?
@_date: 2018-01-08 02:10:00
No wonder I’ve been paying x3 times the amount of fees ��
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:37:14
Get rick quick, no. Idiot, yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:49:42
Can’t seem to sign up directly keep getting directed to Coinbase, very annoying ��
@_date: 2017-12-29 22:49:31
Thanks for your reply. Do I have to "sign" the transaction then after that?
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:28:18
It’s not working at the moment will sign up when it’s back online ��
@_date: 2017-12-24 12:26:42
Sane with me
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:22:42
Interested in quick cash hahaha
@_date: 2017-12-29 23:14:35
Feel like an idiot now it was very simple in the end haha thank you sir
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:23:24
GDAX is Coinbase isn’t it? 
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:44:02
If i buy it off somewhere like localbitcoins/ Coinbase and store it in my electrum wallet is that ok? 
@_date: 2017-12-12 20:56:20
Yes. Tried to increase fee from 0.000039BTC to 0.00039BTC. Just after realizing I have no remaining funds in my wallet would that be an issue? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:43:02
Haven’t a clue what I’ll do tbh hahahaha 
@_date: 2017-11-27 18:36:39
Might hold out til 10k and invest a few hundred at it then 
@_date: 2017-11-27 10:40:27
Is it even worth investing now :-(
