That makes a lot of sense.

55 billion market cap--that's about right.

You guys are being stupid.  The government doesn't give a shit about safe exchanges...blah...blah.  You can keep saying that but at the end of the day that is not the REASON they did this.
We all know it.

Coinbase has a very small limit to the amount of bitcoins you can get in a day.  The govt. knows if you allow this you give the appearance of accepting Bitcoin but people simply can't move assets into it quickly enough.

I agree.

If you think Warren Buffet doesn't know what's going on and has a "just in case" plan then you're mistaken.

Just send me your gf to 8304jsoldj8jsfj9]erg003jws72.  I'll send you my gf if you give me your public address and since the trades are anonymous, we should be good.

The rich are doing this now.  They are buying low and holding.  Why buy a ton and drive the price up unnaturally.

Someone needs to create a 25 dollar or less paper wallet generator you can save to usb and print out--it needs to have full random private/public key generator capabilities.

Also, maybe don't allow that java applet from randompornsite88 to run or don't click on that link while you're in your online wallet.  You know, same kinda thing you don't do while logged into your regular bank account.

There is a ledger for every transaction.  As long as you can verify your public bitcoin address then the blockchain should show that you made a payment to their public address.
Correct me if I'm wrong folks.

Check out what bitcoinranger.com is doing.  He's selling gift certificates to redeem for bicoins.  Try that model or just sell them on ebay.  Folks are doing that too.

Yes because DHS just out of the blue decided to do this now after several years...odd timing.
It's amazing what script kiddies can do against major networks with seasoned admins, professional firewalls and programmers that know how to sanitize user-supplied data.  I mean where do you find THOSE scripts dickhead.

I think fear is a good thing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-05-13 21:02:59
The best thing to do to support bitcoin is create one account to save and speculate with and another for regular spending.
Bottom line:  Bitcoin isn't going anywhere.  Your friends career will be long over and bitcoin will still be around.

I'm sure no one would accept US dollars in bills for those horns.  No way!
@_date: 2013-05-10 01:27:24
Likely though, people will put bitcoin in there bank accounts and Visa and simply keep doing things the way they have been.

Personally, I have my savings account in a public/private key pair generated from armory then deleted from armory.  
I use 7zip to aes-256 encrypt the public/private key pair and just put it on my google drive in case I lose it.  
Anyone think this is nuts.  
I also delete the wallet from armory.

It's a non-issue for the bitcoin network.  It's a non-issue for the value of bitcoins.  It is NOT a non-issue for Americans that want to move money into bitcoin. 
It's also a not a non-issue for Americans that like to see their tax dollars do something useful instead of protecting oligarchs.
Anyone with half a brain knows this has ZERO to do with any type of compliance--you don't go through this kind of trouble because someone didn't click a fucking checkbox saying he's a money transmitter when it's obscenely obvious that's what's been going on for several years.

I recently bought 25 bitcoins through them and transferred them to a paper wallet.  They are good.
You have to get in before they meet their daily limit but if you keep checking back they will have some left.  Once bought it takes about 5 days to get into your account.  Then you can transfer them, etc.
@_date: 2013-05-14 13:04:38
Use a paper wallet for your savings/investment account and any old ordinary client for your checking account.  Done.
@_date: 2013-05-11 19:25:32
You use dollars to buy and sell things.  You use bitcions to buy and sell things.  
The only thing they can say right now is the market for dollars is incredibly larger than the market for bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-05-12 18:13:42
I use coinbase as well.  
@_date: 2013-05-13 15:05:48
Here's how you do both.  You have one wallet for investing/speculating and one for spending.
Think of it like a checking account and a savings account.  This is the BEST thing for bitcoin imo.

You can't keep turning the other cheek while folks stab you in the side.  You won't stay alive long like that.

Why don't you just print some type of money on your printer and hand that out to people?   Better yet you could send them pdfs of your money so they could print their own.
See how foolish your idea is now?
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:14:21
Bullshit.  They are trying to limit Americans from putting value into Bitcoin--bottom line.
@_date: 2013-04-20 15:30:02
Coinbase is working fine for me now.  I think there is a LOT of increased demand though because they meet their daily limits VERY quickly now.  Hence, likely problems from that.
@_date: 2013-05-15 22:18:50
Because it's a fucking scam one central company wants to move people off bitcoin--no matter what the fuck they say. 
If it has it's own money and isn't decentralized, it's a scam.
Ripple pretends to be decentralized but it really isn't.  All the folks that jumped into it early want to promote it so they can make some cash--imo.
@_date: 2013-05-15 23:08:54
I already did that.   :P
@_date: 2013-05-10 10:28:32
NICE out of the box thinking!!
@_date: 2013-04-20 10:08:49
I don't mind being called a moron.  Go ahead.  It's just a discussion.
