Its a good thing. The new buyers that come along wont care if they're paying .13 or .14 "its just a penny difference who cares." price should move easier as a result.

Always thought the A-Lister's were creepy and weird...or desperate. Was actually less likely to talk to a girl on the A-list, seemed like they took the site more seriously than the actual dating.

Please remember that you can sell at Limit order!!! Rather than wack out the bid that is there for SUPPORT. 
*limit order = selling at price that you want, and not accepting any less

you must not be a very active investor, i see this chart everyday. Examples are BVSN, SYNC, QCOR, SWVI, GNIN..... HOWEVER, past performance is not an indicator of future return.
