I should have been more precise: All aggregated beliefs about the future are priced in. If bitcoin could be worth $1000 in a year with a probability of 50% and worth nothing with a probability of 50%, then $500 is a reasonable valuation, ignoring risk aversion and time preference.
If most investors are biased for whatever reason, the price will be also biased. If they partake only in the upside of a price movement, bitcoin might be overvalued and vice versa. If too many investors believe that the price will move in one direction, the price will move in that direction. And - god forbid - if they see price movement as an indicator price movement, that will necessarily create a bubble.
Point being, if you have both 1BTC in your wallet and the current exchange value in dollars, there is no reason to prefer one over the other for payment, except if you personally value one over the other and can take the risk.

Not a dilemma at all. Spending bitcoin on a cup of coffee or spending fiat on a cup of coffee *instead of buying bitcoin at the current exchange rate* are equivalent. If you are worried about reducing your stash, just rebuy.
The market has already priced in all possible future developments, if you disagree increase or decrease your stash, according to your expectations.
Personally, I use bitcoin to buy stuff online, give massive preference to shops that offer bitcoin payment and aim to exclusively use bitcoin online.

@_date: 2015-06-18 15:45:22
The routing necessarily happens through all three nodes, as the first node only gets the information on how to contact the second node and the second node only knows how to contact the third and so on, until the exit node knows whom to contact finally. Thus, succesful data transmission proves, maybe even with electronic signatures, ideally by the ultimate destination if not a Tor hidden service, that both traffic and payment were routed through all nodes.
As far as I know there is no possibility to prevent the second attack, but that is a problem inherent in Tor and not inherent to paying the nodes. After all, we "just" want to solve the problem of how to compensate/incentivise nodes on the Tor network for giving out their bandwidth and their potential legal costs. That is, we "just" have to be sure that the payment process does not reveal any additional information about the participants.
@_date: 2015-06-18 15:28:33
I mean if the user pays by the MB, the worst the nodes could do is to screw your over that last MB. And since the nodes are public, they also build a reputation, so it doesn't seem like that big of a problem.

Can something like this be implemented to pay for bandwidth in the Tor network? This gives an incentive to operate more Tor nodes increasing total bandwidth available and potential anonymity.
@_date: 2015-06-18 13:22:04
Since I am an amateur, this is quite probably not plausible.
Since Tor's basic structure is the trifecta of entry, bridge and exit node and each node knows the identity of the previous one, we could replicate the structure of content tunneling with payments, that is the user connects to an entry node, pays for the stream and the entry node does the same with the chosen bridge node, which does the same with the exit node. It seems to me then that no additional information is revealed through this layering of payments.

Brazzers is owned by MindGeek, the company that operates Youporn and Pornhub. Highly interesting if they would actually accept bitcoin as payment method.
Edit: Recall that Verotel offers bitcoin via BitPay since a few days ago. The vast majority of porn sites uses a similar payment processor, they are in the porn business after all. Brazzers is serviced by Epoch and I'd expect them to have enough leverage to force Epoch to implement a way to accept bitcoin. This feature should then be instantly available to all other sites that use Epoch and push all other major processors such as CCBill to implement bitcoin support too.

@_date: 2017-02-12 19:00:46


Correct. Raising the price incentivised existing holders, especially early adopters to release some of their funds, lowering capital concentration. Higher bitcoin price means mining becomes more attractive, so more hardware comes online, making the network even more resistant against attackers. Higher price also means more market cap, allowing more actors to join that have minimum investment size requirements, which in turn should lower volatilities as these professionals are less scared by singular news from China or elsewhere. More funds means that there will be more sway over regulators as the fund directors will want to protect their investments. As more people participate in finding bitcoins price and protecting its value, more money and attention comes to the bitcoin economy.
It is sad to see this level of economic ignorance on a sub like this.
@_date: 2017-03-16 20:25:34


This is to be taken extremely literally. The people accepting payments from miners - in any form - hold a lot of the power. According to your proposal, they, that is the miner's suppliers in terms of hardware and fiat currency, would stop accepting any bitcoin acquired in blocks mined not according to the softfork *and any block mined on top of it*. Or the first-order suppliers don't care either way, but then the same conundrum occurs one layer removed. This is what is meant with economic majority.

Maidsafe is a rather complex system for paid data storage. Zeronet is bittorrent applied to hosting a dynamic website where you are seeding the websites you visit for free. To make Zeronet more similar to Maidsafe would be for the site owner to pay people to store the site and seed it.


Right. I don't know how this is a question though. You don't have to use Zeronet for illicit purposes, just like bittorrent, but also for stuff like blog posts and recipe sites. The structure of zeronet is such however that not even the siteowner can take down their own website, at most they can tell the world "I recant everything, this is not valid anymore!" but the data will still be there.

Yes and no. Your wallet will need to understand what a valid transaction is for each step in the LN transaction. This is different from having a full understanding of the particular blockchains. Your wallet might even only understand the currency you start from and someone else does the routing for you, this depends on how the route is found and constructed.


You'd pay a LN fee in PIVX.




Yes. However the situation for starting from one currency and ending up with another is rather simple with three participants: You, A, starting from A_coin, the person you pay, B, receiving B_coin and someone actually performing the exchange between the two coins, an exchanger E.
A needs an open channel with E and E needs an open channel with B. To get money from A to B, A communicates with E and B the desire - again, this depends on how routing is exactly constructed - and the transactions are constructed such that the can only happen all at once or not at all. When B wants to close the channel with E, they of course pay the fee for an on-chain transaction in B_coin. If you settle however you pay in A_coin. The costs of the LN transaction are paid in whatever you negotiated with E, they might want to receive it purely from A_coin, B_coin or a mix of both.

* Bitrefill switched to SegWit already: 
* Purse stated in the past that they intend to switch as soon as possible:

A proof-of-concept would be a note with the opendime electronics on it, such that the note is readable via RFID. Literally tearing it in half, adopting the similar mechanism from opendime v1, could expose the private key. I'd say tearing a note is rather obvious.
"The only problem" is that there is no such flexible and thin electronics that they could be embedded in notes.

I sincerely hope it works out and that you'll keep us posted.
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:10:46
This is an amazing piece of technology and a great achievement, thank you very much for making this public and continuing development!
A few questions:
1. If I was a coffee shop owner and segwit was activated, could I, in you opinion, reliably use lightning as it is right now to take a load off the blockchain and not store every proverbial coffee purchase on the blockchain?
2. How much interaction with the blockchain is required? Put differently: If I implement a vending machine accepting lightning payments, does the vending machine need to have an active internet connection or does it suffice that I have a single server that watches a vending machine's addresses?
3. Currently you need btcd to run lnd, will you work on having lnd work with at least bitcoind or maybe even any bitcoin daemon?
I am so excited for this, tomorrow I'll play around with this a little when the installation guide comes out, as I have a few testnet coins.
The genius is that lightning solves or alleviates multiple problems at once: Payment delay, transaction costs, privacy, transaction capacity and blockchain storage, all without touching the basic protocol. Did I miss any?
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:14:57


Are we talking per single note or per some other amount?


Why not lower denominations? Although the answer to the question above might answer this one, I'm afraid.
@_date: 2017-01-10 22:30:36
Interesting. At that price point I'd say something like 20mBTC or 50mBTC would be nice to have too, but for lower denominations you'd need to lower the price.
You say you'll be ready to sell in January. When can we preorder?
@_date: 2017-08-10 23:21:58
I don't know what you take blockchain analysis to mean, but usually it means using the publically available blockchain to find out what actual person a payment came from, where it went and for what purpose. In other words, blockvhain analysis is there to lower bitcoin user's anonymity and privacy. Whatever makes that task more difficult is very welcome as having transactions in the clear makes is possible to taint money, lowering its fungibility and making overall payment censorship possible.
@_date: 2017-08-10 20:24:02
Very big deal. It solves some problems that CoinJoin had, while getting better by adopting SegWit in the near future.
I seriously hope that other wallets do make the effort to integrate Tumblebit into their wallets as comfortably as possible and so increase bitcoin privacy for all users by making blockchain analysis ever harder.
We'll have to see how this is received by dark net market users, those will be the early adopters here.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:43:11
Opendime does something similar where you as a user put a seed on the device, which in turn creates a pair of keys but only exposes the public one, so you can check and load it. To access the private key you need to physically break a part off or punch a hole in depending on the version, making it very obvious that the funds have been accessed.
With paper notes I am not sure how you could produce them that you don't have to trust the central issuer to keep the funds and to redeem your notes. Without relying on some electronics on/in the notes that is.
@_date: 2017-08-11 01:03:35
Thank you for this, I'll give it a good read through. It may seem like overkill, but for the amounts they suggest it seems rather appropriate. Really wish there were graded guides for varying amounts of bitcoin, because hitting a newbie with this is plain too much.
Also having security procedures reviewed by plenty of experts and applied by users daily worldwide is just common sense. Hope that the same will be done for the 'weaker' forms. I mean it is already done indirectly as generating a private key by using dice (as seen in this thread) is part of Glacier, as is generating paper wallets (also suggested here).

The issue is that the electronics takes up a lot of space and costs a lot by itself. But maybe the future will bring lower prices and some technological breakthroughs.
@_date: 2017-01-08 22:22:06
You'd need to regenerate the nLockTime'd transaction every time you spend bitcoins from address A, as they are specific to a utxo. With CLTV you can put more bitcoin or withdraw bitcoin at will. However you really shouldn't reuse the address you use to withdraw from the CLTV script.
It isn't obvious to me which of the two solutions is better. Maybe if Merckle trees are activated we can have vastly more complex modes of storing and accessing bitcoins where the scenario above is a "rather simple" special case.
@_date: 2017-01-12 21:20:00
That's why I am supporting projects like [Polymerbit]( or [OpenDime]( that make bitcoin appear in more traditional forms and compatible with existing structures, customs and procedures. I wish we had a project recreating the debit card system with smartcards and lightning. I know that there are so-called "bitcoin debit cards" that allow you to pay at visa terminals, but I envision a system that doesn't touch fiat systems at all and only implements the lightning payment flow.
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:18:17


I have, but I have no use for it as a host, since I don't publish anything.


It is very much like bitcoin in the early days in that regard, maybe with SPV it will get better. Did you have a look at zeronet? Their client for the zeronet integrates namecoin such that you can go to any website hosted within zeronet that has a .bit TLD.


Again, it is very much like bitcoin in the early days. However registering names, renewing them and so on works pretty well in my opinion. Navigating domains and remembering to renew them however ... yikes, I agree. Again, maybe SPV, otherwise NMC is pointless.


They have few developers and I am in no way qualified to help, sadly.


They didn't change very much. Few users mean very little developer attention, no developers means little attention from users. It is extremely difficult to break this cycle. Maybe hop over to Personally, I'd have thought that NMC would be perfect for registering onion adresses, so instead of cryptic .onion TLDs you could access human-readable .bit domains.
@_date: 2017-01-10 21:21:06
Well 100mBTC would have worked also. Or 100,000bits. There are precedents for notes with the latter number, the SI-prefix however would be a bit of novelty, unless you write it as "100mbtc" or with the bitcoin unicode symbol.

This. Earning interest on btc *without counterparty risk* sounds like a dream come true and plain too good to be true.
@_date: 2017-08-16 00:36:27
The short answer is that the storage methods and their safeguards are a plain mess. This is due to cyber security not being highly developed, as for example physical security is.
Most fat cats will store their keys in many ways, most commonly some form of paper wallets. But universally they keep their keys in cold storage, that is never on a computer that is connected to the internet. Actually, the authors of the Glacier protocol recommend to use some other method to hedge against errors in the protocol and human error!


The Glacier protocol is the most comprehensive and secure guide I know. It also incorporates virtually all security measures named in the comments here.


You can store arbitrary amounts on a hardware wallet, although for a couple of reasons I do not recommend it. When you loose the hardware wallet, you'll expose a massive amount of bitcoin when restoring your private key. Any error on the hardware wallet will put your entire balance at risk. Even some kind of loss of privacy can be dangerous if someone knows for a fact that you have a certain amount of bitcoin stored on your hardware wallet. At that point, the attacker can gather two of his buddies and a wrench to plain force the PIN out of you.
Security is a notoriously hard problem and it baffles me how blase some bitcoiners are about the whole topic.


I am wondering too. ;)
@_date: 2017-08-23 23:39:20


What I find fascinating is that as soon as a merchant accepts Bitcoin on Lightning Network they'll be accepting all compatible currencies from your POV. Especially if they peg prices to some fiat currency, Lightning becomes the perfect *medium of exchange*.


And even just exchanging currency will be much faster, cheaper and safer. A transaction either happens or it doesn't, it happens instantaneously and you don't need to trust any exchange to run off with your deposits.
So if you decide that you like another coin better than the one(s) currently in your wallet, tap your phone a couple times and in an instant get your new favourite coins.

How much work was it for you to implement the payment? Did you use off-the-shelf parts or did you write a lot yourselves? Would you be willing to share the experience with other developers and even the code? The more people use LN the more useful it becomes for you in turn. I can imagine VPN and Email providers that already accept bitcoin to be early adopters.
@_date: 2017-08-23 22:00:57
The mind-blowing thing for me is that LN is partially independent from the underlying blockchain, that is, the exact blockchain(s) we route through are irrelevant for any one transaction, they work together anyhow.

This is an interesting argument. It shows that for a given transaction size at any energy cost per time there is a lower limit for how long one should wait until the transaction is seen as safe against a double spend. For $50,000 it is 90min currently, meaning that in a day you could transfer $800,000.
Of course this is assuming that some miners would collude and willingly lower the value of their mining hardware as such an attack would not go unnoticed.

Diversity and inertia of the system.
If all users ran the exact same software and a bug was discovered, literally the whole ecosystem would shut down. With different implementations however, only those running the software with the bug would be expected. This is the same reason that there should be multiple operating systems (GNU/Linux, BSD, ...), multiple browsers (Firefox, Chromium, ...) and so on.
Inertia is useful as a kind of forced peer review. Again, in an ecosystem with only one software, one developer team can change the rules of the game virtually by themselves. With multiple implementations the teams can propose and implement performance improvement that do not necessarily need to be centralized, but are forced to get together to discuss a change to the rules of the game. With the internet, this forum is the IEEE for network level stuff and the W3C for things like HTML. Programming languages like Javascript, C, ... are often national and international standards. Maybe such a body will develop within the bitcoin ecosystem?

Don't worry too much about the masses. Bitcoin has its uses, adoption is increasing, entrepreneurs find new applications, developers open more possibilities. As those factors play together, more and more needs and wants of "the masses" are better satisfied with bitcoin than with other currencies and payment systems.
When I was in Belgium I was in a supermarket where they advertised each and every savings measure they took as a means to provide lower prices. For example they didn't take credit cards because of the processing fees, only cash and debit. A business like this could use bitcoin payment processing to keep their low prices or possibly lower them further.
Some entrepreneur could come up with a bitcoin based credit card, that implements as many features of the credit card processors and their infrastructure as possible on bitcoin's blockchain, in addition to processing the payment in bitcoin. Possible they can offer lower fees or better value to their customers.
That is the exiting thing about bitcoin being without a central authority and open source: Every plan can be discussed, the possibilities are endless and no single person's imagination can exhaust the worlds opened by the technology.

The bitcoin blockchain can also serve as a notary service for things such as a land registry or all kinds of public or private registry for that matter.

@_date: 2016-11-20 03:59:43
The whole debate is a false dilemma. Segwit sorts out some problems with the block size increase as such, increases capacity by itself and makes it way easier to implement changes as a soft-fork.
A hard-fork should be a measure of last resort, a kind of "major cleanup, because the current technology allows no more juice to be squeezed out."
I for one hope that SegWit will get activated as soon as possible.
@_date: 2016-11-03 12:16:48
That's 11.8% of the hashing power, we need 83.2% points more to activate Segwit. Which can't come soon enough.

@_date: 2016-11-21 06:52:59

I wouldn't dismiss the worry out of hand, like many do. Assuming we implement pruning in a safe way, the blockchain growth becomes even less of a problem. I'd rather bet on sustainable technology, that is a blockchain that doesn't grow excessively than on the continued improvement of storage.


Thank you for asking for my opinion, I am however an interested amateur, so this will be a very uninformed opinion.
What I really like about your proposal is that it does not rely on a hard fork, only a special format for the coinbase transaction. Once new node downloads an arbitrary "checkpoint block" and the UTXO set, it comes to the same conclusion as the rest of the network about the state of the blockchain.
The only attack a new node would be worried about is that the UTXO set was incorrect in the past, but if that occurs, all is lost anyhow. PoW can be checked easily by construction, and since the transactions are hashed as well, we automatically check that as well.
I am not entirely certain what the proposal adds onto the pruning section in the original whitepaper. Would your proposal avoid sending *any* history before an arbitrary checkpoint such that we don't even need to store the headers? Satoshi isn't entirely clear whether pruning just cleans up your hardware or the whole network. Your proposal seems to enable the latter, which seems more in line with the "pure vision" of pruning and the general idea of "the network doesn't need to remember that you bought coffee".
Edit: The hint I take from the whitepaper is that Satoshi speaks of "buried under enough blocks", which makes no sense on your own machine, where you can be certain after the first spend and the first confirmation. Burying under sufficient blocks makes sense in regards to the network, where the argument hints at my argumentation above that it is sufficient to trust that the network worked in the past.
@_date: 2016-12-13 11:02:51
Hey, this might be a moronic question about pruning nodes: Suppose all bitcoin nodes switch to pruning for a moment such that the contents of at least one block are lost. Can new nodes be introduced to the network or do they need the full blockchain and then prune it?
In other words, does the network need the full history to operate accurately, or does it only need the headers plus current UTXO set?
@_date: 2016-12-13 09:51:39

@_date: 2016-11-25 15:07:28
You have a similar issue with blocks mined by BTCC, some are recognized as such, some are not.
@_date: 2016-12-13 14:48:45
Now correct me if I'm wrong, but the whitepaper indirectly envisions such a scheme.
Assume I get only the block headers. To decide that a transaction and thus the next block is valid, I only need to know that the input of the transaction, or more precisely a transaction with the input as an output is in the already created Merckle tree. So, per whitepaper, we only need a convention on what "deeply buried enough" is such that we can discard already spent outputs. By design of the blockchain we'll notice if someone tries to sneak in an unspent output. The reverse issue, forgetting an output, is prevented by it being in the owner's interest to keep in memory and publish the output.
I other words, the UTXO *is* already hashed in the block headers, the only improvement you could make is to discard the block headers too, but for that you need a convention on check points, where it would be easier and even necessary to decide on the "buried deep enough" in the first place.
@_date: 2016-12-04 20:37:52




These are the most relevant points. The cleanups by themselves are not enough reason for something as drastic as a hardfork and the block size increase can be achieved by SegWit, a soft fork. If and when we reach a point where the increases allowed by SegWit are insufficient, we can, after extensive testing, announcement and preparation, initiate a hardfork to larger blocks.
@_date: 2016-12-13 17:38:07

So even if Coinbase is forced to hand over all funds held you are still able to acces your balance in the 'vault'. Conversely, if your key is lost or destroyed you can retreive it with the help of Coinbase. Of course they also offer scripts with more parties, but the above is the essence.

Bitcoin is fine as long as the technology is sound. If a fatal flaw in ECDSA or SHA256 is found the whole thing will blow up. If not, bitcoin will continue climbing if we assume that the current trend of it being uncorrelated with everything else holds.
So to hedge this risk, diversify according to [other guides]( Don't let yourself get confused by either preppers and gold bugs other bitcoin fanatics. If society collapses your investments are of secondary importance and basic goods, not mediums of exchange like gold, are important. If society however thrives, bitcoin is a great bet on a high tech future. And finally, if society continues as is, stocks and bonds will be just fine and in the other two scenarios you'll be at most a little behind the preppers or bitcoin fanatics respectively.

In concrete terms, whenever you have a bitcoin script that has the form "redeemable when ... or redemable when ... or ..." with at least one or, MAST improves upon the traditional way of doing things by only publishing the exact condition you used to redeem funds. Thereby you save the fees/space of the unused conditions and you do not leak information about the rest of the script.
A rather simple example would be "redeemable by A and B at once, or after a week redeemable by either A or B in addition to X, or after two weeks redeemable by X alone." which could be useful for two business partners or a married couple and a lawyer to execute a will after either one or two people have passed.
When the contract is executed while both A and B are alive, they only need to publish "redeemed by A and B" and not the rest of the script. When the contract is executed after, say, B doesn't communicate, they only need to publish "redeemed by either A or B and X after a week" but not the last or the first condition. And finally, when neither A nor B respond, X only needs to publish "redeemed by X after two weeks."
The advantage is rather obvious, as you save about two thirds of the storage space within the transaction, and under normal conditions you do not leak either the exact lawyer's address, nor the conditions that need to be met so that they can access the funds!
Heck, you could even construct a script such that "U and A can spend the coins or U and B can spend the coins" and neither A nor B know of the existence of the other person and their ability to redeem coins, as you can show them just their exact part of the script!
In the specific case of LN transactions you have at least two possible redeem conditions and only need to publish one with MAST at the time of closing a channel, reducing blockchain storage and making LN close transactions look even more like any other transaction.

No, it just means that you don't have to pay VAT on using bitcoin. So if I buy something for 1BTC  from you, I am not required to pay VAT on that 1BTC, but you are still required to bay VAT on the 1BTC you receive.
In other words, there is no penalty for settling the trade in BTC compared to USD or EUR.
Edit: It also means there is no VAT on the simple exchange of BTC for EUR and vice versa.

Use OP_Checklocktimeverify instead of nLockTime. The former gives you an immediately mined transaction with an output that can not be spent unless some time passes. nLockTime gives you a transaction that can not be mined unless some time passes.
With CLTV you can retain control over the private key, can not be double-spent, your output will be valid on any possible future hard fork, you lock in a transaction fee, you can trivially prove ownership of funds with your private key.

Awesome, I hope the proposal is well received and that they'll choose BIP8 as mode of deployment.

I'm not a US citizen or resident, so this might sound stupid.

I wish you all the best of luck. If it actually passes, it will reduce one more argument against using/accepting bitcoin ("But you have to pay taxes in dollars instead of bitcoin!") and put bitcoin on much stronger ground against USD since they then have similar value proposition within NH, namely being able to pay your obligations to the state.

In your specific case it might be that the vendor doesn't want to keep his product or service associated with something completely black market like drugs or non-registered guns. Bitcoin made some headlines as the go-to currency for illicit products and services, so they might not want to give the public any more reason to scrutinize their business.
Generally speaking, when more people want to use bitcoin to buy stuff, and more specifically more people want to use *only* bitcoin to buy stuff, more vendors will offer it as a payment option. For me, I prefer bitcoin as a payment option since it is much less of a hassle to pay with equal or higher security and often cheaper than other payment options, especially when considering fees on both ends of the transaction.
If you'd say what the particular niche is you are talking about we might get a more accurate picture about the vendor's objections. Don't worry, I don't want to doxx either you or the vendor, just gathering more data.

What kind of skills and sill level would one need to participate?
@_date: 2017-05-13 11:21:06


Right, I have yet to see a clear and exhaustive analysis of the costs of the bitcoin network and the distribution of them within it. Miners get directly compensated for their mining with fees, however the users cost of running a full node or accessing a full node exists only as the cost of doing business.
If there was some form of income for a full node operator letting people access it, then they could calculate what the tolerable maximum size for blocks would be for them.


Look at this together with my analysis above. Assuming I am the recipient of a payment and I am using someone else's full node, I can immediately tell my customer that I can only economically accept payments below certain block sizes.
Or there would be some kind of competition. I could have multiple full node providers with different pricing for different sizes of blocks. We then have market where of course bigger blocks lead to lower immediate fees per transaction, but we also see the increased cost of validation.
The problem still remains that you could retard smaller, less capable full nodes as a miner by just mining extremely large blocks filled with dummy transactions.
I'll have to think more about this. In any case developing some kind of market mechanism for the block size limit instead of the arbitrary 1MB limit is overdue.

Are there any official efforts or preparations for such efforts?


Do you have a source for that? It would be great if RSK could start with a running, working and useful dapp from the get-go to demonstrate how powerful it is.


How are they "owned"? Does Bitmain get some kind of royalty? If the code is free I don't particularly care about the owner.


Let them. There are other smart contract platforms running or in development, like ETC, Tezos or aeternity. And of course RSK.


Well yeah, it makes bitcoin decidedly more useful, thus more valuable.

Do they plan on introducing a card like this in the EU too?

~~Yeah it is unclear to me why you'd need a new signalling bit. Since any absolute majority of hashing power can get segwit to locked in status by just orphaning non-segwit blocks with the existing version bit.~~ The 95% threshhold is arbitrary in that sense, 90%, 80% and even 51% will do just as well.
Edit: I didn't read carefully. They introduce a second signalling bit to be used together with the signalling bit already reserved for the original SegWit proposal. If the new bit reaches 80% the compliant miners are forced to orphan blocks not signalling SegWit. This makes the 80% threshhold backwards compatible, so there is little need to upgrade if your node is already SegWit-compliant.

Absolutely none short of bad management. It wouldn't be the first technology to fail because of bad market timing, marketing and sales despite being superior in one way or another.
I can understand some stealth mode for extremely experimental tech but this seems to be somewhat established and solid by now, so it should go into extreme promotion mode. Promote the crap out of it and then copy the ENS to RSK to show that, yes, this platform is usable and useful. Then issue a few ICOs similar to how it is done on ETH and ETC, especially some kind of payment card, seeing as that would be the perfect fit for companies like Xapo or Wirex. Create videos showing how fast payments on RSK are, show the Lumo network working, processing thousands of transactions. And so on.
Yet nothing.

You pay for your Bitcoin with money from a bank account? Access to the larger markets will jumpstart a search. Looking for the times an account is accessed gives an idea in which timezone the owner operates. Some service you registered for and wanted an email adress could be tied to you. Paid for something in Bitcoin where you provided you name? There's another connection.
My point is not that it is easy for you and me. It is relatively easy when you have a massive amount of information. Question is how you can cut the tie between any real name and Bitcoin account if there should happen to be one.

Thank you for the article. I was having in mind an article about south African economy though. Oh well.
Ultimately, you have to show what the immediate benefits of adopting Bitcoin is. It is a all-in-one solution for financial services, seeing as your wallet can not be stolen and the wealth can be transfered easily. The huge obstacle will be finding vendors willing to accept Bitcoin as payment, since I suppose most prices will be quoted in dollars and digital services unattractive or prohibitively expensive.
Then again, a couple of digital goods, e.g. dating sites should be in local demand too. The restriction can also be overcome if it is possible to convert Bitcoin to local currency, leaving the former at least temporarily as a money transfer and storing technology.
Sorry that my suggestions are vague, I have almost no idea about Africas economy. I know there exist huge disparities and much variation over there and so the problems to be solved vary too.

Here are a few options I think people have:
1. The old Bitpay/Bitwallet/Coinbase argument: Any website that currently accepts Paypal or credit card as payment can readily accept payment in bitcoin through one of the former payment processors in exchange for much lower transaction fees.
2. Convince smaller providers to accept bitcoin and gain a competetive advantage through lower prices. This heightens confidence in bitcoin and forces bigger businesses to accept bitcoin as well.
3. Find new niches that are possible through bitcoin. A couple years ago flattr was all the rage: Tip your musician! Now we can do this sustainably. How so? We need payment processing that allows micropayments on the homepage of musicians. Ideally you could tip your musician with bitcoin on youtube, soundcloud and what other similar sites exist out there.
4. Musicians that perform for money and live: Accept bitcoin and ideally offer a discount. This further incentivises venues to accept bitcoin in order to reduce conversion costs.
5. Convince ticket sellers to accept bitcoin. This can be through the services mentioned above.
P.S.: These strategies obviously not only apply to music but in similar form to books, articles, pictures, ... too.

The price of bitcoin is interesting for anyone who wants to have some bitcoin. The price is interesting for merchants who have to pay costs and taxes in national currency. The price is not important if you actually want to buy something. Just decide if the amount of bitcoin to part with is less worth to you than the product or service.
Stability of exchange rates though is very important. Deflation and inflation both discourage trade as it favors one side or the other, as long as the prospect is uncertain. Then again, if nobody spends bitcoin, prices will adjust and all will be well.
So, I somewhat agree, if only just to see if you actually tip me. ;)

Assuming you will have enough cashflow on average to pay your mortgage the difference between the two decisions is roughly 10$, so this is a very nice publicity stunt. In general, if you have on average enough cashflow to pay off the mortgage *and* the variance is low enough to practically never miss a payment I suggest spending any excess money as principal payment. If you see your variance as too high, I suggest deferring payment until december or as buffer to pay any future shortfalls.
But since some entity was willing to give you mortgage and they'd only do that under the belief that they will see that money back, they assume that you won't miss any payments. Based on that judgement, I suggest paying the principal as I do not anticipate shortness of cash.
TL;DR: B, pay now.

For the [block in question]( take a look at the field "version", the 0x20000002 says that the particular miner is using block version 4 and signaling SegWit with versionbit 1 according to BIP9. You can see this more clearly when looking at the number in binary, the right-most bit will be zero and the one left to it will be one, signalling segwit. The first three bits on the left are an artifact of past version upgrades.
For the SegWit2x stuff, take a look at the [decoded Coinbase transaction]( you will find the string "NYA" which people interpret to be signalling for the NY agreement, which is SegWit2x.

To make a more informed decision I suggest you tell us how much interest you pay on what size of a loan and how a principal payment figures in the calculation. That being said, I suggest paying the principal as you obviously already count on a sufficient cashflow to pay future mortgages and this wave is a one-off thing, exactly what principal payments are for.
With the above being said, make your whole operation as transparent as possible so you can harness the wisdom of the crowds. For example, I suggest analysing your cashflows to determine the part you can count on, operate any periodic operations on that and have protocols in place for when extraordinary amounts come in, such as this time.
@_date: 2013-05-19 10:47:04
I think you can make your excellent map more meaningful if you scrape basic data from Wikipedia or so. A start would be nominal GDP and population. You can then calculate nodes/person indicating bitcoin adoption in that particular country and nodes*GDP/person indicating the amount of commerce we potentially can expect from that country, meaning 100 people from Chad would be less able to spend money than one person from Norway.

Single point of failure. If MtGox goes offline or the engine lags or MtGox is the target of a DDOS attack as happened recently 80% of trade is affected. This leads to price surges and crashes, that is instabilities and discourages bitcoin as a medium of exchange. Then also recently we read about exchanges being hacked and the customers loosing all their funds. If MtGox is hacked, 80% of all traded bitcoins will vanish and that will lower confidence in the currency.
But if you have a couple dozen exchanges the effect of any one of them on the price is marginal should they fail. In other words, the whole ecosystem is more stable. Don't put all your eggs in one basket.

Yes. People convert the bitcoin they receive in USD they can spend. But if more people accept bitcoin there is less reason to convert to USD.

If you with the registering route you can treat transfers as instant. Without registration you can not trust the user and have to wait for confirmations. Bit if you control all the relevant wallets, transfer can be seen as instant because confirmation is just a matter of time then.

I still don't get how this is better than scripts, one of the "advanced features of bitcoin". You say because scripts may not be supported in the future, but miners might just as well erase text associated with MasterCoin.
Other than that I am very interested in your protocol. I just do not see anything that could not be done with scripts, too.

I usually use coindust ( to check profitabilities. Given that an EC2 instance could sustain 500kH/s mining NVC at spot price would be profitable. Another option is to look at other cloud computing providers.

All those true. In addition, the number of active bitcoin nodes in India is not increasing as opposed to any other country where exchange volume increases or any other measure of adoption.
However, I hope for bitcoin adoption for both short-term and long-term reasons. Short-term I want India on board as yet another culturally isolated center of bitcoin, increasing the resilience of the network even more. Long-term I bank on the growth of India which will be beneficial for bitcoin to. Medium-term remittance schemes could benefit the average Indian worker.

I am much like you that I don't spend much. Do it like this:
* Buy bitcoin. This is your investment in the bitcoin economy. One part is your stash that you keep, the rest you spend as needed.
* Transfer a small sum like 1 bitcent to your bitcointip wallet. In the standard subs tip the highest voted answer and verify it. When the inevitable question "Woah, what just happened" comes link to the bots subreddit and to this one
* If you have the option to make a purchase with bitcoin, do it, especially if you get a massive discount
Other than that I wouldn't change my behavior. Bitcoin after all is "just" a currency and not a religious project. Feel free to talk to your friends about it and give a couple mBTC to play around with. Maybe they will spend more, who knows?
Currently bitcoin gains most if more merchants accept it and offer discounts because they don't have to pay payment processor fees. So if you want, you can contact them too.

2. It is public where I take out of the Zerocoin pile? That is, how is the Zerocoin spend transaction anonymous?
3. Why isn't mixing implemented yet then?

For Euro countries I recommend  it operates in English, German, French, Spanish and Italian. Payments are from your account directly to someone elses and the platform holds bitcoin in escrow.
But yeah, you are right, any acquisition outside of the US is to be praised. But I feel that because of benign European banking structure, countries with worse infrastructure will have an easier time adopting bitcoin. This is one of the reasons I recomment tipping especially in regional, non-US subreddits.
@_date: 2013-06-14 07:02:30
It is then interesting to note that as the bitcoin supply increases and the price is stable, the size of the economy has to rise in tandem. In clear terms this means that the bitcoin economy is increasing at a current rate of about 13.5% per year.

The world wide web does not know what a border or a country is. Neither should any of the protocols and especially not the currency used. People here always talk about how bitcoin is a distributed ledger, a payment system, a technology, a store of value, a currency. Yes it is all of that but also it is part of a huge movement and a huge inspiration like the current decentralisation movement. Learning about bitcoin forced me to expand my horizon so much, question many beliefs I held as self-evident, learn and draw conclusions from so many fields. I consider myself lucky to be part of this movement and hope so much that I will have this or a similar experience again in my life.

For those who have no idea why this is important: If merchants want to deal directly in bitcoin without BitPay involvement or if they want to receive part of their payment in bitcoin they expose themselves to exchange risk. CFDs help to mitigate this risk, reducing uncertainty for merchants and thus motivating them to hold bitcoins, increasing holding time, reducing volatility.

Ok now this explanation was a lot clearer. From what you write I gather that you are not fully informed about bitcoin and currently researching this topic. What you can implement depends massively on what you are trying to accomplish. I will outline two use cases.
First, you have the option to design an anonymous cam site. Your website creates a walltet for any single show (sic!) and users pre-fund this wallet for the right to watch this show. Let's say you allow watching the stream after two confirmations, they users can see how their balance is continually reduced or they are informed of how much time they will have. They have the option to increase their deposit or to interrupt the stream and get their change automatically back. So at the end you rightfully have a wallet filled with the money for one show and full control over it, whether you want to fork the money over in BTC or convert it to USD or whatever. The side effect of this is that you have extremely high security seeing as in any one wallet at any one time only very little money will be stored. (Incidentally, this is how bitcoin was designed to use. No wallet should be used for more than one sending event)
Option two is if you want users to register in order to deliver personalized service, give them access to a chat or just plain accountability. Users register with an email or whatever property you prefer and get a wallet created for them. This wallet has to be funded but is under your control. This is similar to how the major exchanges operate today. You now again can choose between the model outlined above (yes, with the separate wallets but now you can make the funding internally and instantly, seeing as you have control over the funds) or just internally promise the models the money.
(If the writing above is unclear, I just wing it as I write it. Ask for clarification if necessary)
Oh and what would being an agent entail? I do ask out of curiosity, not necessarily out of a business interest.
Edit: From the comment above I gather being an agent entails bringing models to your agency. This will be impractical seeing as I don't know any willing women am probably located on a different continent than you. ;)

I know some people in this subreddit want to advertise bitcoin in the third world and that is what you should do: Get in contact with these people and find out how you can advertise this system in Africa, India, maybe South America. Mobile phone penetration is near 100% and in countries with weak rule of law a technologically safe way to transfer money is in high demand. They don't have enough money for a complete PC or even a smart phone but practically everyone has a phone that can send and receive SMS so this should be godsend. Good luck, I want to see some usage statistics in a few months.

I aim to please.


Of course. Traditionally such divides are managed by having different companies seeing as I assume a different clientele will prefer anonymity and another will prefer the personal relationship. But speaking from a technical standpoint, if you go by a technical implementation along option one, you can have both and even combine them with a little effort.




The wallet is yours. You just create a new wallet for every user so it is perfectly clear who has how much money on "their" wallet. Once the funds are on this wallet, the funds are perfectly in your control and the user is at your mercy. So no, they are not able to spend the money elsewhere, but you can and should implement the option for them to withdraw their money.


Ignoring that you have hopefully thrown in a factor of 100 in price, no, it is impossible for the user to spend the money in what is actually your wallet in the sense that it is under your control. This is assuming you have them register and deposit the money in the wallet you provided.
Edit: My whole answer is based on the assumption that you want to natively accept and use bitcoin. Currently it may be easier to use a service like bitpay to directly change payments in BTC to USD and use your infrastructure already in place. Of course, if bitpay is much cheaper than credit card you should pass some of the savings on to the user and get a market edge. My solution tries to cut out the middleman and use some of bitcoins power. After an initial implementation you can do much more, e.g. chatrooms that operate for multiple users, whether they are anonymous or not, but only if a certain level of funding is reached. But those are in the future.

Immediate edit 2: Could you implement an option to pay in altcoins, too, if you wanted? Ahh, I am too excited.

Compare this with Tor cloud where they created a simple step-by-step process to set up a micro instance on Amazon cloud as a bridge node. Ubuntu 13.04 LTS will have bitcoind in the packages by default and with some toying around with the other clients I might set up such an image by then.
Indeed, I wonder what other nice OS projects I could support with such an image. Like namecoin, i2p or Freenet.

While I see value in some kind of reputation system as we have it today with credit ratings this proposal completely destroys fungibility and digs deep into the pseudonymity of Bitcoin. One of the main appeals of bitcoin is its near-identity in handling with fiat money and this will get lost.
No. No. No.

I regularly post on where I tip from time to time if I have money. I think it is important to tip in the regional subreddits to increase the spread of bitcoin. It makes the currency much too vulnerable to have it concentrated in any one jurisdiction. Maybe if one thinks about it even longer, tipping in subreddits of South America or India should have an even greater impact because of their relative purchasing powers compared to the first world.
@_date: 2013-04-13 18:03:22
Yes, this is very important for bitcoin as you argued. If you want to convince a particular site to accept bitcoin do the same as with any site: Explain the advantages of bitcoin, mention sites that are direct competitors and also accept bitcoin, promise to spend a certain amount of money when they adopt bitcoin.
Know of any particular, preferably smaller site? Come over at and post the site so we can contact them too.

@_date: 2013-12-30 03:02:51
It most certainly is not. Only in the sense that buying bitcoin based on the belief that the exchange rate to USD will change with time in your favour is gambling. On a prediction market you buy a share in an event if you belive that market to have not enough confidence and you sell - or short - shares in case you believe the market is overconfident. Either case, the same consideration takes place with trading bitcoin on any timeframe.
@_date: 2013-03-25 09:33:21
That's what I meant. Do I, as a merchant have the option to keep the payment in bitcoin only so I can avoid further conversion costs?
How do the prices with you card compare to a classical debit card? With payment in dollars and in bitcoin? How much of a discount can a merchant offer to me if I buy in bitcoin?
Edit: I got another one. How easy is it to integrate support for alt-coins later, e.g. LTC or PPC?
@_date: 2013-07-19 06:04:37
So I took a look at your PDF. Assuming this is legit, I have two questions:
1. Why don't you plan to offer a traditional electronic cash card, too? With the BTC denominated account this would be the long-awaited BTC card. The user does not have to worry whether the merchant accepts bitcoin but only if he accepts electronic cash. I understand you want to save the merchants massive amounts of money by breaking an infrastructure monopoly but that way you reintroduce the 'accept bitcoin' problem.
2. You say you do not aim to serve the existing bitcoin community but I do not see anything in the PDF that suggests that this is not useful for the existing bitcoin enthusiast. As a EU citizen, will I be able to send a market signal by opening an account and depositing a reasonable amount of money?

Yay for you. Spreading the good word. I think that digital content providers are predestined to accept payment in bitcoin. Therefore I think about starting a campaign of the form "I am X and I pledge to spend Y bitcoin equivalent to Y*conversionrate dollar on service at Z if you accept bitcoin." This allows the content providers to gauge how much revenue to expect if they accept bitcoin.

**Edit: Info not correct, read the answers.**
XBT is a proposed ISO code for bitcoin as BTC is already used for the currency of Thailand.

Three questions.
1. You issue a smartcard to use at Neo POS devices. Do you plan on offering infrastructure for online payments at home? I imagine users having smart card readers at home and being able to pay any bitcoin address (or into any Bee account).
2. If I want to support your business model but do not live in Cyprus, is it beneficial to you if I as an EU citizen open a bitcoin denominated account, deposit some small amount of money via SEPA and just let it rest?

The importance of something like bitcoin for the billions of unbanked can not be stressed enough. The importance of something like bitcoin for the remittance economies can not be stressed enough. In any country where there exists a liquid exchange for bitcoin to some locally used currency bitcoin can act as a ridiculously cheap value transmitter.

I suggest you watch this [25min talk]( on the possibilites for inspiration if you are dedicated to start a webcam site completely on bitcoin basis. Especially n-of-m transaction may interest you.
What I am now toying around with in my head is the fact that bitcoin wallets essentially are a pair of public and private keys. Maybe it is possible to encrypt the stream with the keys public key so that only the actual account holder is able to see the stream? But then again this brings complexity and with it mor epoints of failiure.
Anyway, glad I could help. If you want to, feel free to tip me. Actually, talk to the creator of the bitcointip bot seeing as he has a lot of things in place that you can resuse like the wallets for every user. There you can also see my proposal wit hthe seperate account for every user that they can fund and withdraw from but is ultimately under your control.
Sneaky edit: Generally I suggest you orient yourself on other bitcoin businesses too. [Satoshi dice]( is an example for completely anonymous transactions, [Bitbet]( too. [Satoshi circle]( offers a hybrid further away from anonymity but without registration and waiting time to play after initial funding.

It has been said again and again. The ideal place to start convincing people to accept bitcoin are online retailers: People who sell you stuff online or let you view digital content. The smaller the venue the more willing they will be to get a competitive advantage. The smaller the transactions they do, the more willing they are to accept a cheaper alternative. Start with porn sites, small shops, anything, but big businesses will only change if they see their profits getting eaten up by smaller businesses.

It basically is a bank, yes. But a bank currently loans out out your money too on the basis fractional reserve banking, so you don't have to pay any fees, in fact you get some interest, too.

I agree that Predictious has serious limitations but OP was asking about prediction markets in general too. It is too bad that existing platforms have so narrow bets as you can bet on literally any proposition. What's more, you can show your confidence in any proposition by publically placing a bet on any of these markets though there are plenty of situations where this goes against your interest from an economic point of view.

Thanks I guess? I can't speak French so I don't understand what they write but I hope they take my suggestion seriously.

See, this is how you do bitcoin and draw new users. Offer bitcoin as payment option and give high discount! I applaud you.

I sure hope they get it ready fast. Sadly it won't be available in my country (Germany) for quite a time I think.

Yes, the market cap is one indication of the size of the bitcoin community. But the goal of econometrics is to find out more than that about an economy. You can't read the distribution of sectors or user count from the market cap. These two metrics show capability of growth or distortions. The exchange rate itself can be distorted either way, say it could be lower because people are uncertain about the security of bitcoin. Solid statistics can uncover those inefficiencies, reduce risk and stabilize the market.

Internet cafes will be your missionary center. If you know a non-monetary way to help, maybe I can.

What will a reader cost? In the prospectus the number 1.50€ is cited though it strikes me as really low.


Ok then. If I can do online payments I might get an account just to use it and support the network.


Thank you for your extensive answers. You say 'ensuring they prefer Bee', does that mean customers get a discount or that merchants get much more favourable conditions?

Damn, the Americas get all the good stuff and the EU is just sitting there, oblivious. When will you come over here?

$125 for a router? A little steep for a student.
Then again, loss of free spech is nothing to mess with.

Is there a list of standing and planned ATMs? Does anyone know of a plan to set one up in Germany or more generally the Eurozone?

I think prediction markets are just generally so out there and simply unexplored that it will take time until they are established in the bitcoin economy too. Though they should have an easier time as I expect people around here to be more open to new ideas.

I am sorry if my proposal is not to your taste. But does that necessitate being rude?
