what about all the news coming out of people losing their bitcoins and whatnot?

It'll probz go back down. It was at like 900 a few days ago, then within a few hours it was at around 300. Who knows, though... Maybe it'll shoot up to a 1000 and never come back down. I don't have any ATM, but I assume it'll go back down.

I read a neat article in The Atlantic yesterday which was really pretty good and related bitcoin to The Segway, in terms of hype. [HERE]( it is.

Lulz. I honestly don't have any, but yeah, I'm guessing people aren't going to be fond of using the term satoshi's. 
EDIT: I mean, older, white folk, who are not oriental. They would not like to use the term satoshi to describe their currency. I just don't think they would.

Should have said just my .00000000002 bitcoins. Haha.

Oh, this is such a good analogy.

Exactly why I held off putting in banking and credit card information. I might buy in later once the price drops further... Which looks like it might come sooner than later, but I'm sitting there thinking, "Wait, I have absolutely no idea who has access to this info, and I'm just going to absolutely, 100% trust them with it? For all I know, I could check the ole' bank only to ofind missing money."
I don't know. It is scary.  It's still so new, and there is a lot of trust involved, and a lot could go wrong. 
I understand on this subreddit many, many people are going to be attracted to the glamor and promise of bitcoin, and will tell you every way in which it will revolutionize the way we do things, but the thing is, they want you to buy in. To put it simply, that's more money for them. It's a simple truth, but that's the way it is. 
I'm not against bitcoin, and I might buy in to see where it goes, but that's about it. It is far too confusing at the moment for many to grasp, and this at times includes myself, and I can't really see it taking off unless granny and auntie can understand it as well. I feel that if bitcoin is to be a thing of any significance, it will remain a thing of the web, used amongst "internet literate" folks such as reddit users, 4channers, and the like. 
Just my two bitcoins. I could be dead wrong. We'll see.

I thought it was pretty darned funny. You gotta admit, there's at least a little of a bias around these parts. 
@_date: 2013-11-24 02:51:13
Yup. This is what I've seen as well. It's a bit insane, and it seems to me like many people are just hoping to get rich.

This is beginning to sound like a cult. I don't like it.
