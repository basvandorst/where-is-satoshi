Please provide any evidence to back up your claims. No promises for your hardware were made. You exemplify what I am saying. You have unrealistic expectations. You believe a promise was made, but none were. I know you fully believe that there was in your heart of hearts, but if you step back and look at it objectively and read your order, you will realize your belief is nothing but an unrealistic expectation. 
I am not trying to troll you, I am just trying to see if it's possible to get through to someone who so strongly believes something that they just can't accept evidence to the contrary, no matter how definite. So again, before you bang out a knee jerk response about how I don't know what I am talking about, go find any evidence at all that a promise for a delivery time-frame was made. What you will find is an estimate with multiple warnings that it may be delayed. You will also find multiple requests for you to not order if you aren't willing to accept the possibility of delays... But even through all that, you still unrealistically expect special treatment and get mad when you don't get your way.

Sure you may need it, but you don't get it. If you think people will altruisticly just donate fees you don't know people very well. 
But even assuming your premise is true, you will end up with a tiny amount of processing power (compared to current levels) processing transactions, which will then leave the network open to attack. Ultimately, the network will floor out and reach the lowest state to pay for these mythical philanthropic fee donators at only a fraction of the current power.
@_date: 2015-12-17 00:04:45
I know you don't have any evidence, that's my point. There isn't any evidence because it didn't happen the way you believe it did. I also agree with you 100% that a lack of evidence doesn't equate to evidence to the contrary. However, there is ample evidence to the contrary. It is, quite literally, a proven fact. 
This is precicesly what I mean when I say it's pointless to sell to end users. You will believe what you want to believe, regardless of any evidence to the contrary. If your belief is somehow shown to be wrong, it has to be someone elses fault, but it can NEVER, EVER be your own. 
As far as the class action lawsuit is concerned, it is a dead end. It went nowhere because there was nowhere for it to go. The only thing it has done is bilk the defendents out of money for shiester lawyers trying to score a payday. I'd wager the lawyers knew from day one that the case was a failure, but why not put in some minimal effort and get paid for doing virtually nothing? You are absolutely right the accusations line up with what you've written - that's why the lawsuit is a failure. The accusations don't line up reality or the evidence. 
So, before you post another knee-jerk response lacking any evidence to back your claims, let me provide you with proof that directly and completely contradicts your position. I fully believe that even after you are presented with undeniable proof, you will justify why your belief is right and the proof can't possibly be true:
Here you go, directly from A) BFL's website and B) From Federal Court documents depicting the same. If you won't accept either, there is no amount of proof that will sway you from your misguided belief and you prove my point beautifully --- It's never your fault, it's always someone elses:
Direct your eyes to page 6 &amp; 7: 
"This is a Pre-Order product which is not yet shipping. If you're uncomfortable waiting until the development is complete and the product is shipped, do NOT pre-order this product..."
"Pre-Order Terms: This is a pre-order. 28nm ASIC products are shipped according to placement in the order queue, and delivery may take 3 months or more after order. All sales are final."
I'm not sure how much more clear it can be... You were literally told not to order if you don't want to wait, but you did anyway. But somehow, that is not YOUR fault (it must be someone elses!). You were literally told you it could take 3 months OR MORE. But somehow, the fact that you didn't believe it was not YOUR fault, no it must have been someone elses.
That is directly from federal court documents. You can also find similar through the Internet Archive. Somewhere in the mountain of Court Documents you'll also find a page from the shopping cart just before you pay for an order, with similar, yet more stern verbiage telling you not to order if you don't want to risk waiting. Both the Federal Court papers and the Internet Archive provide you with incontrovertible proof to the contrary (That no promises on delivery were made and that you were literally told not to order if you did not want to risk waiting) for your anecdotal evidence. But I have no doubt you will find a reason to discard said evidence and go on believing your anecdotal evidence. 
And that's why selling to end-users is a dead end.

Yes, it is the basic law of supply and demand. If there is an unlimited supply of block space there is zero demand for space. People will NOT pay fees because of their own self-interest if at all possible. People only pay fees now/have for "years" because virtually all wallets default to paying fees. If you instead defaulted all wallets to zero fee and made it just as difficult to ADD a fee as you do to remove it, only a microscopic number of people would be paying fees right now.
I absolutely understand why you think unlimited block sizes will work. You believe people will act in good faith towards the network. Unfortunately, there has been essentially no evidence for this throughout the history of man. Maybe bitcoin will be different than the billions of ideas that have come before it, but somehow I doubt it. Please have a read on Tragedy of the Commons, as that is exactly what will happen with the bitcoin network.

What does spam /fake transactions have to do with it? 
Incidentally, the only reason you don't see that in blocks now is because they are filtered in favor of fee based transactions precisely because block size is limited. If it were unlimited (and blocks are padded), you'd see all the spam... So thanks for confirming my point from an entirely different perspective.

@_date: 2014-06-25 23:40:46
The solution is block padding, so everyone has to transmit the same sized block, regardless of transaction content.  Then the miners are incentivized to pack as many transactions into a block as they can.

Ok, I understand what you are saying, but I don't believe BFL has said anything or made any guarantees on where they are going to host your mining contract. I don't even see it as a reasonable leap of logic to assume that where they are currently hosting would be the same place they are going to be selling mining contracts from. One place hosts customers gear as a third party affiliate and the other (the mining contract) is something BFL is offering... two entirely different things. Not sure why you are confusing the two issues is what I'm getting at, especially in light of the fact that the contract hasn't even reached it's start date yet.

"Allowing an undetected back door" what?  The code is open, everyone can read it... no backdoor has been found.  What kind of back door are we expecting here?  Not to mention that the core client isn't the only client out there and more will come.  That being the case, they won't have the alleged back door in it, rendering it useless.  
Bitcoin core development is 100% centralized.  So what? If a problem happens, it gets forked and Gavin is not longer the lead developer.  That's the point and power of OSS.

You don't have to go wild... the hash becomes the identifier.  
Meaning that hash 834b5e20d394aa2e3eab4d23fb34d0bb was online from hours 0800 to 1100 and transactions x, y and z were sent at that time from address A.
Hash 834b5e20d394aa2e3eab4d23fb34d0bb was online at 1600 - 1800 and address A sent transactions between those hours.
Collect enough data like that and you can safely say that it's likely hash 834b5e20d394aa2e3eab4d23fb34d0bb is address A.  Or, alternately, if you see a transaction from address A when hash 834b5e20d394aa2e3eab4d23fb34d0bb is not online, you can eliminate it as being that address.  
Either way, it's breaching the anonymity that's suppose to exist.

You'd think with the advanced age of some of these pundits, they'd realize that they are so far out of their depth, they just need to shut up and let people with the ability to understand the fast moving world around them speak.  It's kind of the opposite of "shut up and let the adults speak."

The most obvious and easiest solution is block padding. This will eliminate the desire to transmit smaller blocks for faster propagation, thereby increasing the desirability to pack as many transactions into a block as possible. Make it a 4 MB block to start, which gives us lots of room, then that can be increased drop there is necessary. This puts everyone on a level playing field and eliminates the reasons to create small blocks (and incentivises fully packed blocks).

I think it's more a case of the volumes of both the ignorant and the intelligent increasing, but the ratios are (and always have been) out of whack.  So while you have say a 10x increase in volume, the ratio of ignorant to intelligent is 5:1, so you get 50 new, obnoxious voices to compete with 10 new intelligent voices.  
As that trend continues, the intelligent voices get harder and harder to pick out of the cacophony of ignorance, making it looks like there's nothing but ignorance being posted, when in fact it's just an SNR problem and the ratio of intelligence remains the same.
tl;dr: You can't fight stupid. They make up for in volume what they lack in planning and execution.

It's a common problem, especially on this forum, but in some conferences as well. There's no realistic view or expectation on what bitcoin is or can accomplish in a given timeframe and it does harm to the perception of bitcoin. I'm not sure there's any way to avoid it, sadly.
Between the trolls, liberatarians and pie-in-the-sky rambling people with good intentions, it's not surprising bitcoin has such trouble being accepted. It is slowly changing, as we have more market acceptance and bitcoin makes further inroads into the mainstream, those types of people will either fade away or be lost in the noise, thankfully. You might try going to another, more established conference that caters to a more mature crowd and you'll have a different view.

So what part of any transaction is bitcoin necessary in?  You can apply your argument to, quite literally, anything that has been bought with bitcoin in the past 4 years.
The whole point of promoting bitcoin is to get people to use it. If you don't "twist their arm" (which is, quite frankly, a dumb charactarization of the process) people aren't going to use it?  How do you think the first merchant decided to accept bitcoin? Because someone wanted to pay them in bitcoin instead of fiat.
That's how bitcoin spreads... by bringing awareness to it through offering it to people who DON'T accept it. Using it with people who already accept it does little to nothing for furthering adoption on a mass scale.

It would be quite difficult to send a huge volume of transactions without making them identifiable as an attack source. As such, you could easily filter those out of the memory pool and process more "legitimate" transactions and process the attack transactions at a lower priority.
No, I don't think that sort of attack is really a threat. There are much faster/easier/better ways to attack bitcoin than to flood it with algorithmically correct, valid transactions that are both costly and ultimately easy to defend against.
All it would take is one or two large pools to filter the attack traffic and 'poof' ... the attack fails and you just spent a tidy sum for nothing. On top of that, unless you're doing large transactions, you don't really need to do a 6 confirm wait and day to day coffeeshop type transactions are fine with 0 confirms, as they aren't worth the effort to double spend.

While conceptually I might agree with you that he "played the game that Bitcoin's rules explicitly allow," it does not logically follow that he defrauded noone. That would be a logical fallacy. 
Fraud and the bitcoin protocol are not really related. Once is a legal construct and one is (effectively) a mathematical construct. Legal constructs do not have to adhere to mathematical principles (hell, they don't even have to adhere to logical principles) and one can be mathematically correct (following Bitcoin protocol) and still be in violation of the law. 
It would be like saying that it's ok if I kill someone, because the laws of the universe allow me to arbitrarily stab them in the neck (no matter how much they might deserve it) with a fork, so it's not murder. Every (sane) person would agree that if you randomly did that just to prove a point, you are a murderer.

You don't have to take away ALL the power. You just have to take away the infrastructure from a small portion of it. You can already see where this happens today, right now, this very minute.
Why do you think Bitcoin is as popular as it is in developed countries with developed infrastructure, yet undeveloped countries, with little to no infrastructure have zero knowledge or access to bitcoin? Because they can't use it without the infrastructure.
Guess what they can and do use, though? Dollar bills. Gold. Those are durable. They can be used under virtually any condition, at any time, anywhere. Bitcoin, not so much. It's not very durable.

I am sorry that you don't even understand what the conversation is about, which is why you are having so much trouble understanding what we are taking about. Whenever someone starts talking about not "having to go into it," that's a clear indicator of someone way out of their depth, so I guess this conversation is over.
I suggest you go back to the start and try to understand what's being discussed. It's very clear you are confused.
@_date: 2017-01-29 21:14:13
After reading your reply, I went to look up the definition of durability as applies to currency. Both our definitions are not quite correct, or more accurately, there are several competing, dissimilar definitions. I'm honestly not sure which one is "more" correct.
Durability as related to currency is defined as, among other things: Durability of money means that it can be replaced when it is worn out.
I also found definitions that conform to yours, and some that conform to mine. So that said, I would agree with you if we take your definition of durability. However, as per your example, the barter system does precisely what you say is not possible. You can, in fact, trade 1000 chicken eggs for a hog (Well, I'm not exactly sure what the hog to egg exchange rate is, so I'm just guessing). 
But I suspect you are meaning the rate of durability over time, which is fair.  In this aspect, I would agree that bitcoin is extremely durable. But... you still need a huge infrastructure to use it with confidence. Without that huge infrastructure, that private key is useless. If you can't verify that it's valid, transfer it, or otherwise utilize it, it's functionally valueless. Not so with a dollar bill - you can use it under any circumstance, except perhaps if you are on fire. No power needed. No network. There's nothing needed except the bill itself - that is durable. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 18:55:18

Just for the record, I think all of the arguments against larger blocks are complete bollocks. I have no idea why people are so resistant to it and any argument I've seen so far is ridiculous at best.
Identifying blocks or leaving them anonymous means absolutely nothing in terms of diving how much hashing power you have vs the network or to determining the speed of the network. One only has to look at network difficulty to determine what the average network hashrate is over the past two weeks. Presumably this hypothetical attacker will know how much hashing power they control, so the attacker will know how much they have vs the network at any given time.
So while the majority of your argument is valid from the standpoint of people using flawed statistics to bolster a failed argument (larger block sizes are bad being a failed argument) as being bad, identifying blocks doesn't really have any negative effect on anything, except people using flawed data to make arguments. A better crusade would be to get people to stop using fuzzy, imprecise statistics to make arguments against a valid, quantifiable improvement to the network. 
That would, however, require people to be logical and rational. That is a fools errand if I ever heard of one. :)
@_date: 2015-08-10 17:48:49
I'm not sure really where to start in a response to you, so I'm going to back up a bit just to be sure the fundamentals are covered, because I think there may be a misunderstanding at a basic level.
A 51% attack is a theoretical threshold where an hypothetical attacker can arbitrarily dictate to the network what blocks are valid and what are not. In the real world, you would need much more than 51% of the network to perform any sort of useful attack in a reasonable time frame, mostly due to the vagueries of luck and probability. To perform what most people think of as a true 51% attack, you'd need about 80% of the hashing power on the network to guarantee building the longest chain most of the time.  Could it be done with 51%? Sure, absolutely, but it would take a very long time to make your hashing power felt across the network and by that time, the network would likely have responded by blocking out at least a portion of your hashing power.
That said, lets say you either are able to acquire 80% of the hashing power on the network or we just take the hypothetical attack at 51% as reality. Now what?
First, lets assume a world where no blocks are identified and we have no idea who's creating blocks:
An anonymous attacker has no need to hide their hashing power. They mine wherever they want... either on a pool or solo mine until they are ready to pounce. That day comes and they attack the network. Since no one could identify blocks, no one had any idea the attack was coming and everyone is scrambling to fix the problem.
Now, lets assume a world were blocks are identified as best as possible, like we have now:
An anonymous attacker spreads their hashing power out over a number of pools (this would be kind of silly, but hey, why not!) to hide their capabilities until the day comes to attack the network. That day arrives and they switch to their own block generating methods (bitcoind, etc...). Since the hashing power was spread throughout all the pools, no one had any idea the attack was coming and everyone is scrambling to fix the problem.
Same result. It makes no difference if the blocks are identified if you assume a malicious, intentional attacker. 
However, if blocks are identified, we can divert hashing power away from unintentional attacker or opportunistic ones (opportunistic malicious pool operators, such as we saw with CEX.IO et al). 
Your last statement is puzzling - Who is using identified block statistics as "evidence" to support keeping blocks small? That is not a valid argument and I haven't seen any credible arguments use this as a reason to keep the block sizes small. There is no reason NOT to identify blocks from a technical standpoint (from a security/anonymization/freedom standpoint, you could make some arguments, certainly). Identifying block sources does nothing detrimental to the security of the network against a 51% attack. If you buy into the argument that it's an illusion, so what? You're still no better off if you don't identify it.
Now, all that being said, I did realize that through your arguments, a malicious attacker could superficially make it look like a pool had MORE than it's actual hashrate by generating blocks with it's signature. If no one verified that (which is unlikely), you could potentially drive people away from the pool by making it look like it had 51% of the network. Though this is unlikely and easily verified, and somewhat pointless.
@_date: 2015-08-10 23:16:38
I didn't say it had no positive effect on identifying centralization, on the contrary. It has a positive effect of identifying unintentional or benign centralization. It has no positive effect against an intentional, malicious actor.
But even if you convinced all pools to stop labeling their blocks via the coinbase, someone would figure it out and label them. The result would be an even less accurate picture, since not all blocks would necessarily be identified properly. You can't stop random people from analyzing the data and producing their results, however inaccurate that may be. So instead of fighting an unwinnable battle, it's better to provide those people with as much accurate data as possible so they can provide more accurate results.
As far as miners making more profit if the network grows, within the context of the block size debate, I disagree. I think it's disadvantageous for the miners (and likely where a lot of the erroneous negative sentiment comes from) - increasing the block size eliminates the pressure to pay fees to mine a transaction. If there is always enough room in a block for all transactions, then why pay fees? They will all fit in a block. Conversely, if there is limited space in each block, the incentive to pay higher fees to get in the next block increases... larger blocks are definitely very bad for mining and may likely lead to the death of bitcoin mining as we know it, but certainly not for any of the silly reasons people have put forth so far. 
In the larger context, though, Bitcoin needs larger block sizes to accommodate more transactions within a reasonable amount of time. There is a sweet spot on size vs # of transactions per second. I'm not sure what that sweet spot is (which is why I don't jump into the debate), but that is, ultimately, the first, last and only reasonable argument for block size changes. Any other argument for or against it is superfluous and tangential to the survival of the network.
Without mining, the network doesn't exist. Without larger blocks, the network will not grow beyond a certain point. If you disregard either factor, the network will die; it's just a matter of when.

While it's technically possible to obfuscate the origin of blocks, the LOE required and the vigilance that would need to be maintained would be more than most people want to put forth. To truly anonymize block origins over the long term would require significant effort currently. You could do it for a small number of blocks, but over time a pattern would emerge with a particular miner. 
I would wager the majority of the dissent comes from the mining community in one way or another, at least that's always been my belief, since larger blocks completely destroyed the whole mining paradigm as it currently sits. The mining community has never been one to act rationally or with any foresight and it's always someone elses fault when things go a different way than the miner is expecting. This is just another example of that. Mining has typically been about the short term, anything more than 2 or 3 months down the road is irrelevant to the vast majority of miners, so you won't find any rational miners advocating for something that would benefit them three years down the road.
As far as the benefit to identify blocks vis-a-vis benign centralization, it doesn't really matter if there is a benefit. It's "interesting" and someone is going to do it "just because." 
@_date: 2015-08-10 15:48:29
If you are pool mining and you are not the pool operator, you can't do a 51% attack. 
For that matter, if you are pool mining, you aren't really mining. The pool is. You are just providing computing resources for the pool. 
If a certain pool is creating a disproportionate number of blocks, you can be sure the network is becoming decentralized. Identifying blocks helps identify that. 
If you are trying to clandestinely mine a majority of the blocks, you will be doing it solo and can create as many bitcoind instances as you want... But then a large amount of unknown blocks will show up and people will know something is up.
Identifying blocks from known sources  only helps with identifying network (or potential network) centralization, it does not hinder it.

You can't use a single incident as an example of a trend. However, Port Arthur is not the biggest massacre in history. I think the European Jews would have something to say about that (in recent history, if you want to go back farther, there are plenty of examples of larger massacres, even without guns!) I assume you meant the most deaths related to a gun related rampage?
But I digress since you can't really use Port Arthur as an example, since it's an outlier at best, ancedotal at worst. Gun control laws do very little to minimize those events. As you yourself have already stated, Australia has strict gun control laws yet these problems still happen. What Australia does NOT have is an overall population density of 35 like the US. Australia DOES have an overall population density of 3, over 11x less people per sq/km than the US. 11x!
I'm not anti-gun or pro-gun. I am neutral on the point. But I am realistic and I do understand that stricter gun laws will not make a magical happy world appear where gun violence is eliminated or even reduced. The US has plenty of gun laws that are more than adequate to produce the results that people want - they just aren't enforced, enforced unequally or enforced improperly. 
As far as talking about "your" country that someone has never lived in, have you lived in the US? I have permanent residency in Australia and a US Passport. I have lived in both countries. Based on your statement, that would make me more qualified to speak on the subject, I suspect (not that I agree with your statement).

It does not, however, mean they know anything about how to actually do the job. That, they will learn as they go along.
As a side note, I'd also like to know when you got your PhD. "Cloud computing" is a nebulous term and can be a lot of different things, but I'd be interested in hearing how your PhD allowed you to acquire the knowledge of how to do your current job. Or, more likely, I suspect you learned what you needed to know to actually do your job on a day to day basis OJT or through self study/teaching. Your PhD gives you a great foundation to work from, but it did not prepare you for the actual workforce.

I never said population density was an excuse for gun-related violence. If I did not make it clear, then I apologize. While it's not the reason, it is a contributing factor and more than a minor one. You can simply look at history - when there is less population density in the US, but as many or more guns per capita of a given area, you have less "gun violence" on a "mass-murdery" scale.  Joe-Bob shooting Jimbo because REASONS is not what's being discussed here, is it? Because Port Arthur, Columbine, Aurora, etc... are very different things from day-to-day gun violence where one individual shoots another over a real or imagined slight.
I was responding to the comment that Australia has a "reduced the number of school shooting massacres in Australia compared to America." 
Guns are less common to those individuals involved (as perpetrators) than they have been historically. In the early days of the US, up until the early/mid 20th century, many, if not all homes had a gun or had access to a gun of some sort, yet we did not see mass shootings in schools or public venues with the frequency we do now (although some would argue that point as well and they'd have a valid position since it's the reporting and classification of such that has changed in addition to a potential increase).
All that said the people that are mass murderers who plan and execute these sorts of things are going to get their hands on guns whether it's illegal or not. Stricter gun control laws are not going to prevent the occasional wacko from shooting up a theater or a school. It simply won't happen and all it will do it make it harder for free, law abiding citizens to do what they want. It will curtail freedom for no net gain, which is why the assertion that we need stricter laws are doomed to fail.
One of the larger contributing factors to gun violence is poverty/unemployment/inequality. With a lower, larger socioeconomic class, you have a direct correlation with gun violence. Seeing as Australia has a better social safety net than the US, it comes as no surprise that gun violence is reduced since there is less pressure on the lower economic classes. With a lower population, safety nets become easier to manage, fund and distribute. So you have a direct correlation with reduced gun violence due to social policies that have virtually nothing to do with gun laws. If everyone is fed, sheltered and cared for, they have less reason to be violent. If everyone earns enough to live, they have less reason to be violent. Those are two factors the US lacks when you compare it to Australia. 
Now, to address Port Arthur directly as a comparison with the US. I would need to look into contributing factors in Australia for a statistically valid comparison between the two, but I can say from the charts and numbers I've seen (provided by yourself and others) that gun violence has dropped as a particular rate since 1994 in Australia. True, absolutely.
Also true, gun violence (Homicide, because who are we kidding - that's what we're talking about. Suicides by guns don't count and I haven't looked into factoring that in, but I imagine it factors in at a similar rate) in the US has dropped since its peak of 7 per 100k in 1993(!) by nearly half, to 3.6 in 2010.  Almost EXACTLY the same amount as in AU. 
Firearm-related crime (non-homicide) dropped by nearly a factor of 4 in the US during the same time period. I can't find statistics in AU for non-homicide firearm related crime during the same period, I apologize. It peaked at 725 / 100k in 1993 and dropped to about 181 / 100k in 2011.
You say you have "seen how my country has changed before, and after gun control." No, you haven't. You've seen how your country has changed and that's all. Gun control probably played a small factor, but it most likely had very little to do with the decreased gun-related homicide rate and far more to do with social and economic policy that reduced violence across the board (The US and AU were in pretty tight lockstep in regards to economic policies during that time period, with AU being even more proactive than the US).
I prefer AU to the US for a host of reasons. I think many things about AU are superior to the US. gun control laws notwithstanding. I think they have very little effect and the statistics back that up.  When you cherry pick the statistics you want to show how gun control laws lead to less gun violence, it's easy to show that it is the case. But when you expand your statistical gathering and factor in many related factors, be they 1st order, 2nd order and even 3rd order, you start to see the real picture emerge, and that is gun-control laws don't do anything to solve gun-related crime.  Social advancement, equality, economics, and education easily have the largest impact on violence and crime compared to any other measures COMBINED. If people really wanted to solve violence, gun-related or not, they would be focusing on those things. But those things are hard to do properly and very expensive... it's much easier to blame it on laws and try to legislate the problem away. But as history has shown time and again, you can't legislate that sort of thing away. Ever.

It's just now going to packaging and they think they are going to be shipping product in a month?  That seems... unlikely...

Well, if you've been around the tech industry for more than a few months, you'll realize that many (most?) tech companies are typically late at some point with their pre-release products. Even the largest companies are late and the smaller a company is, the more prone they are to missed schedules. Even the likes of Intel and AMD are months behind schedule on their products from time to time.  Are they taking pre-orders? No, for the most part Intel and AMD don't do that, obviously. However, they are still late. 
Holding small companies to the standards of the likes of Intel, AMD, Nvidia, etc... is somewhat unreasonable to begin with, but then when you gloss over the problems even the large companies have and compare the small start ups to an idealized version of a large company, well, your argument just falls apart.
Sorry, I'm not buying it. Yes it sucks that the companies are late, but it's not unexpected or unusual in the tech world. Not by a long shot. The only difference here is people are emotionally invested in the magic money machines and have a conniption fit when they don't get them immediately, which has been compounded by the fact that so many people don't factor in OTHER people buying equipment when they make their purchase, which is only now starting to become a visible issue.

BFL has stated that it's a 92mm x 92mm x 15mm fan.  BFL_Josh on the chatbox last night said you can take the top off the Jalapeno and replace it with a 25mm thick fan and put a grill on the top if you want a totally silent unit.

Who cares about the MTGox price?  It is meaningless... you can't get funds out of Gox except as BTC, so it's kind of useless.  Use

You beat me to it!  I was going to say something similar.  No one is saying the entire weekend is a dip (or at least not that I've seen), just that the price drops significantly and/or more volatility/price swings on weekends than weekdays.

There is no hassle.  If you don't want to pre-order, don't pre-order. What's the problem?
