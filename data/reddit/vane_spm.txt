But that is not what they said. They never once said "on chain". You appear to be making that assertion in order to push your solution to said assertion.
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:18:20
Straw man fallacy.  You assert that steam is saying on chain payments don't interest them. That is not what they are saying.

If your rent is denominated in bitcoin, and the price is fluctuating wildly, then every month's rent cost is going to be very unpredictable.

And before the FDIC, they may have been right.  :-|
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:27:57
You talk about future state like its already here.  It isn't.
Today Bitcoin is very slow and has high transaction fees.  If you want to see the problems with it, just go look at why Steam has stopped accepting it.
How long are people just supposed to play along with this?  "Don't worry, it'll be better tomorrow!"
Man, I've heard that song and dance before.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:11:19
You could, you just wouldn't want to.
If you owed 1 bitcoin a month for rent, the actual cost to you would have gone up 1000% over the last 2 years.

Maybe another digital currency will solve some of the problems that make BTC untenable.  Bitcoin, as a currency, is dead.
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:14:13
lol. ok.  will do.
When you get your bitcoin stolen or the price tanks, just remember who told ya so.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:41:47
I am, in fact, being sarcastic.

Bitcoin is anonymous. Don't you know anything?
@_date: 2017-12-07 04:33:29
How do you pay your bills?  Definitely not in bitcoin.  Could you imagine if your mortgage was in bitcoin?  
Bitcoin is completely, utterly untenable as a currency.  I recommend you ride the bubble as long as you feel comfortable and then sell.  Ideally soon.  
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:19:18
The other concern is that if you, say, buy a house for 10 bitcoins in Nov. 2017 what happens when you have to pay those back in Dec. 2020, but now bitcoins are worth 30,000$ a piece instead of 15,000$?  You'll owe twice as much as you borrowed.

You actually don't have anything until you sell. Gains or losses aren't realized until you cash out.
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:28:38
So you would take out a loan in bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-12-07 14:09:06
Could you imagine if your mortgage was in BTC?  If you set it up last year, the actual cost of the mortgage would have gone up thousands of dollars a month.
Nobody would ever want their currency to do that.

When I buy something from Amazon with dollars, it doesn't take 12 hours to go through, nor do I have to pay a 1$ to 20$ transaction fee.
Bitcoin as a currency is dead. Bitcoin as an asset bubble? Going strong. For now.

But where is the incentive for the retailer in that scenario?  Does doing bitcoin transactions benefit retailers in a way commensurate with the discount you would receive?  I presume they don't give discounts to people purchasing in British pounds vs. US dollars, so why treat bitcoin any differently?  Let the currency stand on its own merit.  If it's worthwhile, the market will allow it to grow.  If it's not worthwhile, the market will dispose of it in favor of better technologies.
@_date: 2014-12-16 15:15:02
The request was for the retailer to give incentives to spend bitcoin with them.  A  1% discount probably won't do the job.  If they give more than that, they've presumably eaten up their profits, for a net loss.
@_date: 2014-10-09 21:17:54
Shouldn't a book on bitcoin suggest the equivalent of $5 in bitcoin?  Or have we all caved so easily to the dollar standard?
@_date: 2014-12-15 22:54:15
Why would I do that until there is some advantage to using bitcoin over a credit card?
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:26:55
I'm guessing he's found a way to short-sell bitcoin as an insider.

Supply and demand is a separate function from value.
Gold has both intrinsic value (uses for jewelry, metallurgy, etc...) and extrinsic value (use as money).  These two forces pull at each other, and one can affect the other.  If demand for the intrinsic value of gold increases (like in my scenario above), it will affect the extrinsic value and vice versa.
Both fiat currency and Bitcoin have only extrinsic value, which allows them to avoid the pitfalls of a substance like Gold.
Both the intrinsic and extrinsic value of Gold and the extrinsic values of Fiat currency and Bitcoin will be affected by supply and demand.  Bitcoin's supply is regulated in a way that allows no one person or group to rapidly increase or decrease the supply, Fiat currency is free floating, and can be rapidly increased or decreased by central banks.  Gold's supply is limited by how much you can pull out of the ground through mining.
@_date: 2015-01-28 19:41:41
Gold has intrinsic value, bitcoin does not.  I think that's his point.  Bitcoin's only purpose is to be money.
It should be said, however, that the reason the world left the gold standard is because the artifacts that come along with a monetary base that has intrinsic value cause instability in that monetary base.  You can't use gold for money AND use it for dental fillings.  Or rather, you CAN, but the short supply of gold will add unnatural expense to both.  
Imagine if gold underpinned the global economy, and suddenly some property of gold (conductivity, malleability, whatever...) made it absolutely essential that a nation state get as much gold as possible; for this mental scenario, we'll say it's defense.  It would DESTROY the global economy.  All the nations of the world would try to hoard as much gold for their defense budgets as possible, and it would leave the economy without the very thing that allows it to function.
This scenario (in a less extreme form) has already happened with gold, and it's why we moved to a currency with no intrinsic value.  It is also why bitcoin has no intrinsic value.  You can't really DO anything  meaningful with bitcoin outside of using it as a mechanism of exchange.  Note how all the purported benefits you listed have to do with exchange.  Those aren't "intrinsic value" things.  Those are properties of the technology that built around bitcoin.  There are no annoying strings attached to bitcoin (like there are to gold) that could pull it away from its primary purpose.
The bitcoin community needs to stop deluding itself about this whole "intrinsic value" thing.  No, bitcoin has no intrinsic value, and it was done intentionally.  This is a feature of bitcoin, and a bug for gold.

Bitcoin is based on sound technological principles but unsound economic fundamentals, which will prevent it from ever becoming stable.  This will push people who simply want to buy and sell things away from bitcoin, since simply holding bitcoin is risky.  It is really only useful for monetary transfer from one currency to another in a way that circumvents traditional exchange roadblocks, since risk of using bitcoin is less than the risk of attempting to transfer the money with traditional means.  
Without a healthy base of consumers willing to use Bitcoin as a currency of exchange it will fail.  Stay away.
**TLDR: no**
@_date: 2015-02-02 19:07:18
Bitcoin has a fixed supply of bitcoins, which will cause fluctuations in the price beyond what anyone can control.  This natural fluctuation is what will cause risk in the system and cause casual spenders to steer clear.
