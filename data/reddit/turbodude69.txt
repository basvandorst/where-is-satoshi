unless they fix the prob with transaction fees, it's hard to see BTC remaining the leading crypto through 2018.  at some point all these new investors will realize BTC just isn't functional as an actual currency and there are PLENTY of competitors nipping at it's heels, just waiting to take over the market.

i did, before wall street decided to get involved.  now i've been forced to move over to ltc, which is fine, but it also reveals flaws i never noticed before with btc.

yeah but paying with a crypto can be as easy as opening your app and scanning a qr code.  it's up to the app developers to make their apps more user friendly.  
when the pc first came out, you needed to know commands to use it, then we realized a simple UI is the way to go for mass adoption.  now 2yr olds can use a tablet. 
i'm not sure if it's possible, but if you could embed the price in the qr code too, then it would save even more time.   the cashier could ring up your items, show you the total and qr code on a screen and you scan it with your app.  transaction goes through as fast or faster than a credit card and you move along.   that's not complicated at all. 
after doing a little research, apparently this is already possible with btc, not sure about ltc.  
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:10:31
does it though? bitcoin hasn't really handled the volume well for like 2 months now, and even before that fees were already too high. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:12:45
uhh if you're buying a bucket of chicken...what would be the advantage of using btc over ltc? higher fees? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 17:36:04
thanks, i hope bitcoin can get some of this sorted out before the market decides to switch to something else.  it really would be sad to see btc take a dive and a corporate/gov controlled crytpto widely adopted.  it's straight out of mr. robot! 
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:16:57
what about the bitpay visa card? 
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:15:52
wtf, when will this problem be fixed? i have bitcoin stuck in a bitpay wallet,  been waiting for fees to come down to send it to an exchange. 
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:11:16
crypto isn't that difficult to use, i'm pretty sure my parents could do it but they have no reason to. there also has to be a clear advantage and for most people, there isn't one.  
i mean even for me there is no advantage in using crypto day to day.  my cc offers cash back/miles/points so banks literally PAY consumers to use their product. AND that product is accepted almost everywhere in the world.  AND it's insured so i don't have to worry about fraud. 
it's gonna have to be businesses offering incentives for people to use cryptos as actual currency.
@_date: 2018-01-12 08:08:09
lol, does this really work? jesus, no wonder so many companies are no longer accepting bitcoin. 
are developers actively working on this 24/7? if not, i can't see how btc will continue to be the most valuable crypto. every other crypto i've used confirms almost immediately and has fees less than .25c USD. 
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:39:32
cool, well i guess i'm just gonna hold onto my btc till fees come down some more.  respect for all the members of the community doing the hard work to get this problem cleared up 
@_date: 2017-12-26 09:09:57
do people do this for free? or do you get a small fee for it? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:51:24
why the hell would bitcoin cash use r/btc instead of r/bch? they just trolling r/bitcoin? 
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:48:33
curious, what's the segwit fee vs non segwit right now? 
i just checked super economy in my bitpay wallet and it's down to 300 sat/byte vs over 500 yesterday...so thats good 
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:35:45
not really relevant to btc, but clean water in cambodia is WAY cheaper than in the US.  as is pretty much everything else.  i bought beer, redbull, coca cola, etc from street vendors for like 25 cents...water was about the same.  
@_date: 2017-12-25 17:53:24
hah yeah i know, i get your point thats why i said it's not really relevant to btc.  just wanted to make sure everyone on the internet knows how cheap cambodia can be.  it's ridiculous. i bet even btc is 1/4 the price there! jk
@_date: 2017-03-23 15:25:21
not really a grammar nazi, but if you're gonna call people stupid and dumb, at least check your spelling. you sound like a trump on a crazy tweet rant. 
also, be realistic.  the USD is a waaaaay safer currency, regardless of how much debt we're in.  if the USD goes down, the whole world economy goes with it.  BTC goes down, 0.000001% of the world population gets annoyed and starts using a different  cryptocurrency. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:36:17
but they could arrest thousands of people.  what makes you so sure that every person in the world is going to be using bitcoin when/if it's ever made illegal? 
 if bitcoin was made illegal right now, would i be able to get my bitcoins converted to usd?  i'm assuming i'd need to get them converted to some other currency first, then convert it again. 
@_date: 2017-01-25 05:06:56
ouch.  so if the US ever banned it, bitcoin is pretty much dead?  
@_date: 2017-01-23 14:08:45
how would you convert your bitcoin to USD if it was banned? go through a foreign bank? 
i'm actually curious what would happen if the US gov banned it.
@_date: 2017-01-26 05:57:32
thanks. it seems nobody here wants to talk about what seems like a very real possibility.  i understand that almost everyone here stands to make money on bitcoin being successful, but we should all be realistic about its future and be prepared if it doesn't go the way we want.   
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:39:29
no way it'd give it strength.  it would delegitimize it and make it waay more difficult to exchange to a legal currency.  i mean i can see how it's impossible to fully eliminate, but why would it go UP in value? 
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:02:32
[cripplingly slow is basically down. do you really not remember 6 months ago??](
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:21:12
abra does it. and litecoin and lots of other alt coins. 
@_date: 2018-06-03 16:39:23
bummer, welp LTC is almost as cheap as doge.  after all this altcoin dust is settled, i think LTC and BTC will be the big winners for everyday use and monero for the shady shit. but im still holding doge anyway...it's such a positive community i can't help but like it. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:52:06
That's true. The visa network being down is unacceptable. But luckily there are competitors. I doubt visa,amex, and MasterCard would all be down at the same time. Also, I've been in restaurants when the cc system temporarily goes down, they just do it manually. It's not like all commerce grinds to a halt. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:04:22
basically all of december and january.  if it takes 4+ hours to send a payment, the network should be considered down. 
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:32:34
there are very few things in my life that i could actually pay for with bitcoin, so i'd need to convert my bitcoin sometimes to pay the bills.  i'm assuming if it was banned, then i'd be even less likely to buy anything other than illegal drugs with bitcoin.  if it's illegal to use, then it's almost useless. 
@_date: 2018-06-01 22:40:13
the postal service is also working when i mail someone a check and it takes 2 days to get there.  
@_date: 2018-11-11 05:43:15
why is it that the only physical bitcoin machines are in sketchy ass places? and why are we celebrating this?  
i know of 3 bitcoin ATM's and they're all in shitty ghetto gas stations or ghetto liquor stores.

if i was an artist i'd travel the world doing this.  imagine having 20-30 of these spread all over the worlds biggest cities?
