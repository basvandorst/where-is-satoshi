I am grudgingly agreeing with you. Hold your nose and give customers the freedom to choose is the right thing to do.

You could be protecting yourself against ex post facto laws.
Also, the body of law is so huge that all of us are criminals anyway.  The selective application of these laws is one tool government can use to suppress free speech or otherwise extort certain behavior out of you.  Why provide them with any unnecessary information about your activities?

So you have to go through KYC procedures to buy a measly $20 worth of bitcoins?

What is this "policing" function of the Bitcoin Foundation that they refer to in the last paragraph?  Are there any examples of its use?

They neither confirmed nor denied being under a gag order.

One thing to keep in mind is that there is a huge number of bitcoin detractors who troll with relatively few detractors on I attribute this to the fact that bitcoin has gotten big enough to threaten the existing financial order.  With so much troll-induced negativity in this subreddit (showing a significant increase over the last 6 months), it's no wonder people aren't in much of a tipping mood.  Your points are well taken, however.
Edit to add: I've also made significant contributions to some of the causes that have come through here recently, like Dorian's fund and that domestic abuse organization in Canada.  Those don't show up in the tip bots.

For all we know, this could be a big farce.  Apple and Google are pretending to lock down our phones, and the FBI is pretending to object.  Don't trust any encryption that isn't open source.

If he's truly a good coder, then it's a waste of talent for him to become a congressman. Today we are ruled by laws which are enforced with guns; tomorrow we will be ruled by code enforced with cryptography.

If Wikipedia is making a tacit statement of support for Paypal and credit card companies, then my opinion of them just went down.  
To the OP: it's a free market.  They don't have to accept bitcoin, and you don't have to donate.  End of story.

I've used Zinc to buy things on Amazon in conjunction with a Coinbase account.  The Chrome plug-in makes it really easy.  They give you the choice of popping up a QR code to pay from a mobile wallet or transferring directly (off blockchain) from a Coinbase account.  I had an issue the first time I used it, but Doug from customer service was extremely helpful and kept hounding the Coinbase people until they resolved the problem.

What "success" are they talking about?  Ethereum is still mostly...ether.  Besides, the concept of colored coins predates Ethereum by a couple of years.

You might think about adding support for Python at some point. It also has a lot of users in the life sciences field. For example, Cell Profiler is a open-source cellular image analysis platform from the Broad Institute. Due to the number of pixels in high-resolution microscopy images, processing more than a handful of images can quickly become a massive computational task.

Scala, sweet!  That will be a welcome addition to the bitcoin ecosphere.  Looking forward to perusing the code at some point.

They should be pushing SSDs to keep up with the blockchain.

I‘ve already moved 90% of my computer-related purchases over to Tiger, Bitcoin Store and Overstock. Yes, Overstock does occasionally have good deals on decent hardware.

So I installed the KrpytoKit extension, but it's not recognizing the donation address at BitcoinAcrossAmerica.com.  Maybe you should either put a text address on BitcoinAcrossAmerica.com or update KryptoKit to recoginze bitcoin QR codes.

Recovered the small amount of BTC I had with KK, but that will be be the last time I use either Chrome or browser-based wallets.

Realcrypt?  It's compatible with TrueCrypt containers and is available in some Linux package managers.  I don't know much more about it, however.

Your otherwise excellent analysis is undermined by your partisanship.  I'm getting tired of people inserting irrelevant political analogies into discussions.  If you side with either the Democrats or the Republicans, you're just perpetuating obsolete social structures.

Would you mind disclosing your reasons for posting in and how bitcoin relates to you, i.e., are you an investor or entrepreneur in the bitcoin space or an employee in a financial services organization?  I'm trying to understand your motivation for such a huge number of posts.

Would you consider Ethereum to be a "jumbled Swiss Army knife?"

I don't know of any non-profit examples off the top of my head, but many people have had all or part of their bank balances siezed by the government. That's a pretty stiff fee right there after trusting the bank to safeguard your assets.  That can't happen with bitcoin.

Fr33 aid's wallet was stolen by a hacker, not the government.

Perhaps it was a MITM from the NSA, listening in on the taps between Google's servers.
