One thing that leaves me wondering:
if you HAVE the possibility to create fake money, would you really dump it right away in your own lawn so that people like this guy can more or less easily find it out? Especially in this huge volume...

Could someone explain the following to me, as I read through Lightning and how the "lock up" with multisig addresses works. There is always some failsafe to retract your locked coins in case the counterparty just disappears or doesnt want to pay.
Lets take a real-world example via that Starbucks use case. You send the 0.0001 BTC via lightning to the vendor it gets locked in a multi sig node first which is valid for maybe 24h. Starbucks gives you the coffee. What prevents you to retract your locked coins after you drank the coffee and walked out the store?

I cant get to the true conclusion of this even if its true - what does this mean for people who:
1) also lend out USD on Bitfinex
2) who use USD for their own margin funding

Thanks - but vice versa, what prevents Starbucks from screwing me over then if i gave them my key and they dont give me the coffee in return? One side must take the first move right?

can anyone even confirm that they sell these amounts via exchanges - would rather sound smart to sell via OTC and darkpools to NOT impact the prices. Thats trading basics even with Equities when you have large baskets

If someone could summarize how they solved the charge-back scam efficiently i would be grateful. From what I read they havent at all but rely on "small limits each month" only, which deters scammers.
In either way, not a usable way to cash out

If i were an U.S. customer I would prepare my anus as they will most likely pass all data to the IRS directly

maybe if someone could share some experience in cashing out bigger amounts &lt; 10k, but more than 5k would be interesting.
To be honest for small scale cash outs (100-200 USD equivalent) I can use Bitcoin ATMs in my area as well

I thought the same but the constant fear of online wallets being "hacked" was too big - i decided to store them on Mycelium + export the wallet + seed on paper in case my phone got stolen or breaks. The paper is stored in a plastic sheet within a file folder where hundreds of other pieces of papers are stored, like old invoices, bachelor degree, marriage cert...
Any additional security advices? Like installing and importing the same Mycelium wallet onto a separate phone as well?
