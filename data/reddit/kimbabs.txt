Would've been hilarious if he'd looked between 9AM and 10AM today instead.
Never gamble with your life like this.

I sincerely hope then that you were not watching between 9AM and 10AM.
The drop to 10K was something, but we back at 13K now bois.

It won't crash. Korea is at over 21K

Welp. 
I switched from mining ether to nicehash and I was halfway to payout.
That kind of hurts.

Here's to hoping you HODL'd this morning as well.

Almost had my moment of weakness barely 2 hours ago.
Legitimately questioning whether the panic selling would not stop.

Honestly probably has more worth as its actual material than the valuation.
Fire starter, paperweight, insulation... etc

That's actually a really solid point. The Venezuelan government can't see that you have it or seize it even if they know bar torturing the hash out of you.

Every time I advise people to invest some money in btc they give me: "It's so expensive, there's no way it'll keep going up"
I've told the same friend to invest at every point since the first time it hit 4,000. I recently told her again, reminding her about futures opening up. Same thing, meanwhile she lost thousands on a stupid stock buy.

The 2200G and 2400 G are pulling 40+ fps on some titles on low/medium
You also gotta consider that this is incredibly budget gaming for 100/169 MSRP each for both a cpu and a 'gpu'.
@_date: 2018-02-27 17:53:26
They're meant for budget systems. They do excellently for that.

Isn't this my point exactly.
Let's not even go with a Camry here, let's go with a Corolla or a Civic. The Corolla does it's job ADEQUATELY at an entry point in delivering a person from destination A to destination B. The Mercedes E Class does the same, but it does it better given say, a smoother ride or a more luxurious and comfortable interior.
Of course they're different, but it's not really apples and oranges. A poor person who wants to play games on a PC will potentially resort to the APU to get the job done. The APUs get the job done ADEQUATELY. It's not elegant, graphics suck at low, but modern games are still PLAYABLE (30-40+ fps). 
For some people, this is all they need. I know that this used to be me before I could afford any of the parts I have today. 
I was running an Athlon II X4 and managed to scrape up the money for a 4650 at one point.
I barely was getting 30 fps at low on 1080p, but at the time, that was good enough, and as good as it was going to get for the total of $400 I'd spent on my prebuilt + graphics card.

Potentially up to 10,000 people died during the crackdowns.
Dissidents were jailed or executed, and in general protesters were fired upon and run down by APCs and Tanks. 
He likely either spent a long time in jail, was killed later on the spot, or executed.
