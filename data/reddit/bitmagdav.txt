I moved my coin off Gox after I watched their system fail hard during an early bubble.  Switching wallets is not weak hands, I had never heard that one before.  I always considered moving off exchange into a private wallet or cold storage to be a good indication of stronger hands.  My mistake.

I often enjoy rooting for the underdog.  Especially when they have smarter and better looking code.

Bitcoin is not a respecter of persons.  You shouldn't be either.  Big names. Big deal.

I think the economic majority needs to stop talking and start voting by acquiring mining resources.  Don't fire the miners, replace them.  Embrace the protocol.  Let the consensus emerge with a renewed interest in mining. 
Brag about economic majority, but without taking the risk and deploying capital it is just a paper tiger.  Economic majority that does not deploy capital is asleep at the wheel.  Talk is cheap.  Deploying capital is not.

You and I have a different idea of what it means for btc to drop through the floor.  Are you new here?

Weak hands

Yes, probably that is the easiest way to hold.  How long will it take to deploy out of alts when the panic sets in?

I don't care how they feel.  But I know how I feel about keeping any and all btc I have intact.  Its not an issue of making them pay for their poor decision, its just my (apparently ignorant) self interest.  Any remorse they may experience for my leaving their platform is an unfortunate an unintended consequence.  I can't be bothered to mourn their loss.  Feel free to indulge if you like.
