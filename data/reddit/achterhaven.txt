There are plenty studies that show increased minimum wages create jobs and bring a whole area up. Keeping people at just below subsistence level strangles the economy. Every cent earned by a low wage employee is spent in the local economy and goes round. Every cent squeezed out by a company disappears to a tax haven 
As the old story by henry ford goes. He had to pay his employees enough money to buy his cars, so he could employ people to make and sell the cars.
having shitty companies pay shitty wages does nothing for the economy except suppress opportunity of good companies who cant compete in a race to the bottom.
If you force companies to pay a fair wage, they have to offer a fair product. thats when these buisiness who winge about the minimum wage are exposed to real competition and fail because all they know is making money by crushing pressure on wages and not by innovation or quality

I think you mistake the problem as public sector and welfare issues. There are well running government systems and hospitals and there are badly run private institutions. 
Better improve the management and tackle corruption in the systems before deciding the system is inherently flawed

If a company cannot pay minimum wage then it is not a viable business. When companies pay below minimum wage then its basically a welfare for the company as that employee must be supported by the state.
You state yourself that companies cannot even pay a minimum wage which is shit. Seems like the companies are failing not the state.

I thought of that, but wouldn't it still be possible for someone to follow a trail down to my main account when i consolidate into manageable accounts? Or are you supposed to end up with 100's of wallets with small sums. 
For example if i pay someone, i check their public account and it only has my payment. But then i keep checking until it is transferred to another account. i check that one and it has a lot of money (their main account). i now know their net worth.

Thanks. looks like i have more to study regarding wallets. at the moment i have a single paper wallet so i need to learn about working with multiple addresses.

If i have a wallet with a public address to pay and receive bitcoin. Does that mean that anyone can check my account for balance and transactions?
What if i don't want to broadcast this to everybody i do business with. It seems dangerous.
