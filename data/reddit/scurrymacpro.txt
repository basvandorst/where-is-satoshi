I study this day and night and there is no news I know of regarding China in March.

Not going to happen.

India and Spain and Italy and Uruaguy and Australia and other countries are discontinuing fiat.   People will have to abandon it if their countries do.

Maybe movement in China about Btc becoming a regulated currency in the near future?  There used to be a live graph that showed where the btc was moving into what country.  Anyone know where that same site is?

Yes.   They are already discussing making btc a regulated currency.

NO, in California.  Awaiting the btc money I sold 8 days ago to move to Poland to live and work in a 16th century restored palace as a baker and butler.  All my money is in btc at coinbase the past 5 years.

I do not want to say lack of response, it just seems that I am a tiny number, perhaps. I am trying to be civil .... arg arg!  And, I am in dire straights.
I will email that info at your email address here.  I have screen grabs, too.
Kindest regards,

Actually, good sir, I emailed you here at this reddit account a day or so ago!  Thank you!

Well, dude, thank you for sharing that.  I will not give a crap next time if it takes two weeks, but I am divorcing after 33 years and I was a house dad and have about nothing but the few btcs I tucked away, hoping to change things for our lives when it went big.  But, we split up and she got everything .... so, thanks for sharing that.  I continue to be hopeful.

Rosey discovered the issue and I am indepted to her and John and Jason at Coinbase.  A long customer satisfied and happy.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you.  Always remember, people, that we have to have our names matching both the Coinbase account and the checking account.  I learned a lesson here.
