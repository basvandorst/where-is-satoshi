I agree, I don't think Dimon (JP Morgan dude) had little to nothing to do with it. If you are invested in bitcoin, you should know banks don't like bitcoin, but I do understand why China is scary.

I can agree with that, I can't wait for the day when people are able to use it for its intended purpose and virtually every company accepts it.

It is tho...
@_date: 2017-09-14 03:25:59
I've already seen many many things that say they are just putting regulations, not outright banning these currencies, so I don't see how it could drop much more, it already seems to have stabilized around $3850-$3950 and now I'm just waiting on the rise
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:10:06
I use Coinbase too what isn't getting verified and what country are you in?
@_date: 2017-09-13 11:39:09
I'm east coast and already w��️ke
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:58:50
Go to the site Paxful.com
I think that's what you're talking about
@_date: 2017-09-13 17:02:40
I've never had to do that here in the US, just to make sure you are using CoinBase.com right? Not some other site possibly wanting to scam you? 
@_date: 2017-09-17 04:59:28
Through what? Paypal?
@_date: 2017-09-14 20:28:25
he wasn't asking for some lol...
@_date: 2017-09-13 14:23:16
I'm sure it could, we just have to let the general population know!
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:18:55
Well by the time it crashes to that low levels and we realize bitcoin is having troubles, selling would only mean losing money. You never lose until you sell, and instead of viewing bitcoin as an investment, view it as a currency because that is what it really is. Even if the dollar amount fluctuates, you'll always still have the same amount of bitcoin (which I know doesn't apply to people in the short term) but it should be viewed as a currency first, and an investment second if we really want it to be the future.

Not word for word, but he said it on his twitter when a guy asked "wanna make a bet"
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:42:35
Ok so I'm guessing you've already typed in the bank with your account number and routing number and all that jazz...
So to verify you'll have to wait 5-9 days after typing in all your bank info.
After this period of time Coinbase will send a few small charges into your bank account.
You type in these charges on the Coinbase website then Bam, your Coinbase now has access to your bank and you can spend your bank money.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:43:00
I agree, it would defeat the point of crypto

Buy the dip, I'm also a minor and every penny I've spent on BTC, ETH, or LTC has been a joy. Be careful though it's addicting lmao

Sí Señor,
"Even if Coinbase were to become insolvent, the funds held in the custodial bank accounts could not be claimed by Coinbase or its creditors. The funds held in those accounts would be returnable to Coinbase’s customers."

Coinbase would be my pick, it's online so you don't have to worry about a bad hard drive or something, and they keep most of their stuff offline except 2% of their transactions (so this has the offline safety) and if anything happened to go wrong they Hair tee they'd replace everyone's coins free of charge in their terms and agreements.
@_date: 2017-09-17 03:01:30
As in going bankrupt?
@_date: 2017-09-17 02:49:18
Why? They guarantee your coins are safe? Where else are you going to get a safer deal?
@_date: 2017-09-15 13:17:45
If I were you I'd eventually setup a Coinbase account.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:57:50
I'd say Bitcoin, Ethereum, and Litecoin/Monero
( and potcoin, I could see dealers and sellers wanting their own currency ;))))))

It seriously makes me want to pull out a loan for a trillion dollars, it's so tempting, but I've already spent what I'm able to on the dip...
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:41:19
I've been thinking about opening an ATM too, and the way I see it, it's essentially a bitcoin advertisement, people will be inclined to walk up to the bright orange box and ask questions or even try it out. I'd say that would be the most influential help for your community.
@_date: 2017-09-15 03:49:04
Exactly, I trust Coinbase ! They've always seemed secure and this is literally insurance, I don't see how anything else could compete in the security department.
@_date: 2017-09-13 13:51:52

Hmmm, I guess laws and regulations in the U.K. could be different...

Wallet services tab- 
Coinbase Insurance- All digital currency that Coinbase holds online is fully insured. This means that if Coinbase were to suffer a breach of its online storage, the insurance policy would pay out to cover any customer funds lost as a result.
The insurance policy covers any losses resulting from a breach of Coinbase’s physical security, cyber security, or by employee theft.
Coinbase holds less than 2% of customer funds online. The rest is held in offline storage.
This insurance policy does not cover any losses resulting from the compromise of your individual Coinbase account. It is your responsibility to use a strong password and maintain control of all login credentials you use to access Coinbase and GDAX.
Literally don't know a safer way

Is Coinbase not allowed in India? Fees are high but prices are accurate.
@_date: 2017-09-13 15:36:01
Yeah once the 140 million or so realize how screwed they are they'll look for an alternative to regular banks.
