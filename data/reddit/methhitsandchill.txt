How do you think he bought the cigarettes.

Does anyone know what the exchange rate  is when making a purchase? Do we get the coinbase exchange price?

Why wouldn't they give it back?

Someone didn't watch the video, you totally glossed over the point that Reggie is making.
*LOL, not sure why I'm being downvoted...anyway, to put it extremely succinctly, Reggie's point is that even on private blockchains, two parties cannot truly trust one another.

There may eventually be a solution to this problem, like a regional business entity that verifies the contents of a package before it ships...I dunno.

I guess it seems counter-intuitive to buy bitcoin with bitcoin.

Another tweet says that he sold millions of dollars worth of btc to an unlicensed digital currency exchanger. I wonder which one he used.

Not sure if intentional.

[3:44:22 AM] George Hallam [ETH] : Does anyone have any contacts at Bitfinex?
[3:44:36 AM] George Hallam [ETH] : cant reach them
Authenticity confirmed.

Will CME ever offer a 24/7 product?

What's a PPB debit? If it's a debit card why would it be dubious?
@_date: 2016-11-02 01:58:42
So you paid 10$ to receive a debit card, and yet you are concerned about the possibility of a $5 fee if you don't use the card within a 90 day period? You can't remember to buy a stick of gum every 90 days?

This is a pretty awesome development, it allows for OTC trades of any size.

Well, at least you came to the right place to get the attention of Coinbase support.
@_date: 2016-10-29 03:18:53
Holy Shit! There are three Coinbase employees in this thread! Who would have thought they even had that many people working support?! I've had support inquiries via e-mail and their own forums go completely unanswered, and this post somehow gets the attention of three members of Coinbase's support team. [Incredible!](

If you want to take a wire transfer, you're going to need to verify your identity with the exchange. If you plan on taking a wire, you might as well use a US based exchange, the fees will be lower and transfer time shorter. US options are itbit, gemini, uphold, coinbase, kraken (if your state is supported), Genesis Trading, and probably a bunch of other brokers.

Not sure what you mean by this, but last time coinbase had a countdown, price pumped until the clock hit zero, then there was a spectacular dump.
@_date: 2016-05-24 04:45:21
Lol, wouldn't be surprised if we see a repeat of what happened last time.
@_date: 2016-05-27 06:16:25
Its likely still at zero confirmations so coinbase has not added the balance to your account yet.
@_date: 2016-05-24 20:23:49
You don't need 6 confirmations, you should be able to spend a balance with 1 confirmation in Electrum. Some wallets let you spend 0 confirmation transactions.
@_date: 2016-05-24 08:31:52
Where is this doubled after coinbase narrative coming from? That's not what happened at all.
@_date: 2016-05-27 19:44:54
In your other reply, you said you checked blockchain.info and the transaction was non existent. It seems like you never sent the transaction. What app did you send the btc from?
@_date: 2016-05-22 08:20:52
It seems like massive pre-mines lead to highly inflated  market caps during bubbles.
@_date: 2016-07-14 18:31:01


Your making an assumption about my opinion here, I actually don't get involved in the politics of the blocksize discussion, I just thought your analogy was irrelevant. 


Please name a few. A database change on Coinbase.com is not a trustless transaction, I'm sure they can be reversed. Good luck transacting a decent amount without issue with those heavily compliant businesses.


Okay...I don't consider that using bitcoin, there are massive issues using these service providers; in using them, you are far from able to transact freely.
@_date: 2016-05-09 00:19:11
Anyone who trades btc knows where the liquidity is (China).
@_date: 2016-07-06 07:30:08


What do you mean by this? I have 2fa with no sms through Coinbase.
@_date: 2016-07-14 19:03:46




Bitcoin has qualities that make it better than cash or digital cash, I don't see the point in turning bitcoin into paypal; It doesn't seem like an advancement to me.
@_date: 2016-07-14 17:24:34
Btc only has value if it can be transacted. There is no trust less way to transfer btc in physical form.
