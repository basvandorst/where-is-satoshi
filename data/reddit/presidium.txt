Maybe they just have a handful of sats. Cheaper than a lootbox addiction.

I see you also learned your TA from the mystic hills near Nagoya, Japan.

Also, you can only unlock 12k again if you deleted your savegame and all associated game data after 2018.

I remember seeing this number on the way down. Kind of takes the edge off a bit.

I would fucking love to learn how to produce something similar to this. What tool/software was used to produce this?

Thanks for the reply! 
Seems like that middle step (producing each graph) is something that a program or library would do, but maybe not. That sounds like a pretty big effort.

How did you get $5k with no experience? Not calling you out, just curious on how that conversation went.
@_date: 2019-01-27 05:13:37
Fair enough! I realize that my question sounded shitty, but I couldn't think of a diplomatic way of wording it. But the opportunity coming through a huge trust vector (family) makes the situation make all the sense in the world. Without that trust vector, I don't think anyone would fund a venture with $5k without "more".
I wish you all the luck in setting this up!

Aside from the obvious "**$212,000 Million**", this article is a steaming mess. butchered the headline by seeming to attempt to write $212 million, while the actual article's headline mentions **$230 million**.
The article's sub headline specifies that it's actually **$229 million**. 
Then the article's body changes it to **$212 million**.
The article quotes a twitter account claiming that the amount is worth **$400 million +**.
Then later in the article, it refers to the amount as "**$292,000 million**", which doesn't make sense on any level.
I'm actually speechless.
