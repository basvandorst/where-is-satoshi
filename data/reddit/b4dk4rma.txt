There should be a money trail all the way back to where you earned your money assuming it wasn’t cash.

I think he’s saying that it isn’t but has the characteristics that can make it be one some day.

No it’s the exact opposite.  People who bought it lower than it is today would want to sell at a gain, given my explanation above. 
Is the 31 day rule with regards to triggering an artificial loss or gain?

Yes and that would include all buyers who purchased lower than it is today.  I also made a point about prior year capital losses.
Say you lost money on stock 5 years ago.  You can only claim capital gains against capital losses, generally, so you could sell bitcoin at a gain today and carry fwd the capital losses from the past.

No idea but yeah given how far the markets have been going up I wouldn’t expect a ton of people to have prior years capital losses.

Other reasons to take profits now are to claim capital losses to offset the gains.  In Canada for instance you can carry capital losses forward for 7 Years I believe.  In this case you wouldn’t pay tax on your gains up to your losses from current or prior years.  Other tax reasons to cash out now would be if you had lower than normal or no income this year.  In Canada you don’t get taxed on the basic exception and we have tiered income levels which tax at higher rates the more income you make.
