I bought a ledger nano from them, didn't pay with btc, but had no issues with USD.
Also got a reply from their CS same day when asking about the backorder status on, and they gave a 10% off discount code for the delay.
I would not say they are a scam company, and I did get my order.

Remember you are going to need to kill whoever does the tattoo. Crypto is mainstream now, everybody knows about it.

True, and they got a lot of backlash on the bcash thing. That's the only poor experience with them I guess. Just releasing it out of the blue for shit to go crazy with no notice.

No coinbase and gdax are the same. If you have a coinbase account, you automatically can access gdax with the same credentials. I just meant when you transfer Bitcoin out of gdax, they cover your network fee which is pretty great, and I don't believe any other exchange does.

Right, I know they are eating the network fee. But in times like this, you're right, it is a lot of free money they save me. Which I just feel is an often overlooked service they offer when everyone is busy complaining about them.

Correct, thanks for explaining it better. I thought it was a little complicated. I just wasn't sure if anyone knew how it works, and I'd imagine that lots of people would also have a similar question for doing next year's taxes. I know it's really early lol, but the thought crossed my mind today.
I could use a little extra cash for an emergency that came up, but I also think I should try to manage with credit short term, and just continue to hodl.

On the other side of things though, and I was thinking about this the other day.
Since you can't charge back bitcoin, what stops the seller from not sending the goods once they pay in bitcoin? Or even if they do send the product, virtual or not. And it is lost or something happens, the buyer just gets screwed? Sometimes charge backs are legit, and owed, and seems like a possible issue for bitcoin.

I hear you, and agree. It just didn't always used to be this way, and it worries me.
In a retail situation where it even takes an hour to get say 3 confirmations, can't they double spend those coins, and a merchant might get ripped off if they let someone leave with product that show it pending in their wallet without confirmations, and then it doesn't go thru because it confirmed somewhere else sooner.

3 hours is a long time waiting in a store to buy something, if the masses are going to get on board

Hey man, had this same issue yesterday. Selected normal fees on my ledger nano s, which was $.07
Took about 20 hours to confirm..

Probably because someone makes a thread with this same question 10 times a day

So, buy Antminers from the people that are apart of the attack on bitcoin we don't like? 
Most people here can't afford to buy mining equipment that is only sold from the S2X supporters, and have cheap enough electricity to pull a profit.

Thanks for the info, was looking for a site that may show everything pending

Great information above, I'm new to BTC, and cryptos in general. I think the concept is great, and how many advantages this has over normal currency. It's crazy to see how much BTC has grown over the years after doing some research. I really hope it continues to grow, and become the future of currency. 
My question is though, how will bitcoin continue to be developed, and adapt to the quickly growing competition? Do they have employees, or people that work on improving bitcoin? I've read about issues how much BTC is growing they can't process transactions fast enough now due to the recent increase in volume. If they can't adapt, and become faster. What will stop an altcoin from taking its place? How can BTC become the future of currency we want it to be, if it can't scale to huge demand?
