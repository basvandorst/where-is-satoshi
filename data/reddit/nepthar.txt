I'm telling the internet police that you swore at me.
And reporting that comment as spam as well.

Reporting your report for spam for spam.

Just bought a kindle case! They made it outstandingly easy.
I just wish I had actually issued a transfer. Since they use Coinbase and I was logged in, I don't think there's a record of it on the blockchain.

Okay, this is the missing piece of the puzzle here, thanks. When I heard stuff about not being able to withdraw, I assumed that only fiat withdrawal was blocked/difficult. This definitely makes sense.

That's very cool. I'm just reading through Cryptonomicon and there's a discussion of a cryptographically-secure digital currency in there as well. It's pretty cool to see that these ideas have been living among us for quite some time. It makes me feel even more confident that this will play a huge role in the future of humanity.

I agree with your conclusions, but I have different reasons:
* There is a transaction cost associated with all investments except those that involve sitting on existing funds and hoping the value of those funds increase
* Everyone strikes a balance between spending now and future spending. Let's simplify it as a ratio: [current spending] / [total income]. For many people, this is 1 (no savings)
* Different people find their own ratio for different reasons. Two of those reasons are uncertainty of returns and cost of investing. A predictably deflating currency removes both of those items (for a default 'hold on to my money' investment)
My conclusion is that having a deflationary currency will change those two reasons (at least) and shift the ratio and unknown amount for an unknown number of people. I do not believe this shifting will be very significant as there are MANY more reasons that people invest and I don't think the rate of return on hoarding bitcoins will be significant.
I still believe that a currency with zero inflation/deflation would be ideal. Lots of interesting metrics could be accurately extracted from such a currency and there would be no incentive to make long term investments in the currency itself (which helps nothing).

I would love to see the end of state controlled money. The realist in my believes that states will STILL try to control bitcoins. They may stockpile bitcoins in the same way that gold is stockpiled. I wonder how much control one entity could exert over bitcoins if they were able to buy up huge quantities.

Guess I don't have to build this after all.

Huh, cool, I'll have to stop by. I've been meaning to pick up $100 or so in bitcoins for a while now. Seems like the longer I wait, the less I'll get for my money.
