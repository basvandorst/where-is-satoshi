I'm in NYC where there's nothing below $1 million :( 
@_date: 2019-03-11 19:51:49
congrats my friend. Very happy for you. Hopefully I can do the same in 10 years. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 13:16:49
thanks for sharing. After reading that there's no way I'm trusting blockfi with my BTC
@_date: 2019-03-15 19:59:34
thanks! I'll need to check it out 
@_date: 2019-03-28 19:38:15
with blockchain technology a market will emerge where people can sell/trade NFT's

Well just spent time reading through all the FAQ and it's not available for NY residents so I won't be getting this account anyways. So odd that they a NYC firm, using a NYC custodian but they don't make it available for NY residents.

which coffee shop? I'm in NYC
@_date: 2019-03-13 14:36:42
Thanks! After doing some research I learned that BlockFi doesn't provide any type of insurance so I don't feel comfortable lending any of my BTC to them

Hello, is the blockchain running slow? I made a transaction and it's been about an hour and I haven't had any confirmations. I can't even check the hash
@_date: 2019-10-27 21:53:56
Hello does each hash also contain a timestamp?
@_date: 2019-06-19 14:04:02
thanks. That does sound fascinating but I know I'd be happier living in the EU. I'm from America so it's not like I get to visit there often. I having my teaching certification so I'll get a work visa by teaching english in Prague and from there I can travel to other countries. Hopefully my investment in Bitcoin will help me offset some travel expenses :)

Yes, I was withdrawing from coinbase to a wallet. All good now. I don't know why but it took about four hours to go through.
@_date: 2019-10-24 18:19:57
Here's the destination address:  1LraJ8iGjWpjrXJut9AT87zSksdzyCmNvX 
What's weird is I made a withdrawal immediately after that one and the other one went through. This one doesn't even give me a hash. Coinbase support website says that BTC service is experiencing a downgrade in service so that could be one reason. Let me know if you find anything
@_date: 2019-06-14 19:27:47
Got it. Thank you for clarifying.
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:44:25
so how do you get your private key if you buy from an ATM? I have no desire to buy from one as I prefer to keep mine in a hardware wallet but I've always been confused how people buy BTC from an ATM and store it
@_date: 2019-06-13 16:32:11
really!? How come you say this? I live in New York City and have been wanting to move to Europe for some time. I've already seen all of western europe, but I haven't seen too much of eastern and I've heard Prague has low cost of living. I'm tired of being in a super expensive city like New York
@_date: 2019-10-25 13:58:25
Transaction went through. For some reason it took nearly 4 hours. Thank you for checking!
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:42:36
for real
@_date: 2019-06-14 17:53:54
What if a user doesn't have a wallet and it's their first time buying BTC?
@_date: 2019-06-14 18:22:01
530 USD to live near city center!? To live in midtown in NYC, an apartment without utilities is about $4,000 a month. After utilities you're looking at another $200. Wow you guys are lucky to be in Praha
@_date: 2019-06-13 20:51:58
so I would be able to live in either of those two cities without having to leave after 90 days? I know currently as a US citizen on a tourist visa, I'm only allowed to be there for three months in the euro zone. And everything that I've read has said that prague has low cost of living. I've only been there once and it was only for a day so I don't really count it.
@_date: 2019-06-13 17:58:32
Yeah prices have been going up everywhere unfortunately. It's a good thing we have BTC to offset it
@_date: 2019-06-16 21:43:04
thank you for the advice. I've definitely thought it through heavily and I feel that prague would be the best place for me to move to europe. I'll definitely get a roommate so I can save some money and continue traveling. I'm still a little bit away from achieving this goal but it will be something that I do eventually. Thanks for taking the time to speak to me! Cheers
@_date: 2019-06-14 20:52:02
Got it. Well to be quite honest with you. The city that I would prefer to live in is Amsterdam. But it's tough for me to get a visa to move there also expensive. So I think prague is perfect for me because it's close to Amsterdam but it's also close to eastern European countries that I haven't been to yet. I also haven't explored much of germany. So it's pretty much in the middle of so many places that I want to see and it offers low cost of living. 
I'm searching for a city that will be fun for a young adult, not insanely expensive like london or paris, a city where people are nice and I  I can walk around and feel European haha. A dream come true would be that I find a european girl so I can get dual citizenship, but that's a big stretch.
@_date: 2019-06-13 15:43:13
hell yeah I plan to move to prague in a couple of years!
@_date: 2019-04-11 20:12:59
get the ledger. it works fantastically.
@_date: 2019-04-05 17:19:16
this shirt is amazing! I'll need to get one for myself
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:18:14
this was absolutely incredible. I was laughing the entire time. Kudos to whoever made this.
@_date: 2019-05-07 18:17:19
If I may ask what was your investment strategy to get to where you are now? I'll be honest I don't have a high paying job but I'm doing fine. I've been dividing up my salary between paying off debt and investing in digital assets. This month I'll be debt free which will allow me a lot more money to continue investing, but I still feel poor. Granted I've only been in crypto for two years and I plan on holding for at least another 8.
@_date: 2019-05-14 17:11:04
pomp doing amazing things by spreading the word of bitcoin!
@_date: 2019-05-03 17:57:21
I've been reading articles that the lawyer for the creditors has been urging people to submit claims? I'm sure you did but just want to make sure before the period is over! I really hope you get your BTC back!
@_date: 2019-05-17 15:10:55
Thank you very much for this post. I really needed to hear this today. Cheers.
@_date: 2019-05-08 14:20:04
wow, congratulations my friend. I'm very happy for you. Reading your story makes me believe that I can reach financial freedom as well. I haven't been able to buy BTC in a while because I was being smart and erasing all my credit card debt first. This will all change very soon and I'll be putting every extra penny I have into BTC
@_date: 2019-05-07 20:25:05
thanks for the advice. Are you just buying BTC or are you diversified?
