It will not have much positive effect. In the UK gambling is legal, overregulated and dominated by few strong brands. There is no advantage for UK punter to use BTC (unlike in the USA).
On the contrary: UKGC will ban domains of all unlicenced operators and bitcoin bookies have no money for the licence.

No I do not mean banking. And banking really does not need bitcoin. If bitcoin is used as money then banks will be closing shops. "Crime and greyzone" are areas of economy, where there is a strong demand for some goods but law prohibits or restricts to sell them.

If you have a bank account (some banks open accounts for minors) and it is just a small amount then it is possible at many exchanges. You will have to put there just fake dob and be sure you are not sending there more than the amount where the exchange verifies your identity.

Agree. people do not care about fees way over 1 USD. The fees in p2p transactions of ewallets are around 3%. Average buy at DM might be 100 USD. It would imply something like 3 USD, but for bitcoin pseudonymity and such sensitive market people actually might pay premium.
Also since it is a flat fee, the bigger transactions over btc will be always cheap.
There is no problem right now.

You are right. However the title here quotes 90K loss as a big loss in a way "hey, let's spit a bit more on the big thieves".
There is a perfect justification to have big money on exchanges, if you are making them work. But then as you said, you took a risk. And when the black swan occurs then it is simply something you had to count with. Nobody should hold at exchanges more than he can lose. And with proper moneymanagement no loss is so terrible that anyone has to beg for sympathy with amounts that are for most way too high.

Jesus Christ. Where I said I do not like Chinese miners? I just accept the fact that value of my bitcoins depends on their decisions. As also value of my and your bitcoins depends on FED decisions about interest rates and as it depends on infinite amount of other factors. The banksters still define the value of bitcoin even if you hold all your private keys, because the value of bitcoin is shown in fiat currencies and even the few grocery stores found out that it is not worth of it to offer bitcoin payments for the 2 visitors per year and then wait with them for confirmations.

If he wants to treat it as savings account, let he has just cold wallet(s). No need to complicate the thing with hot wallets from the beginning.
Price now is very good, before next takeoff.
My advice: Either use HW wallet or some other cold wallet (dedicated computer or flash stick with backups, like ethereum). Buy bitcoins at reputable exchange (in EUR area it is only Kraken, in USD you have more choices), immediatelly transfer the bitcoins to the cold wallet and that is it. Then read about bitcoin a discover other things.
Learning about wallets and addresses is not easy job, it will/should steal you couple of dreamless nights. But do the research properly.
And yes. To have btc as savings account is probably a good idea. But do not forget, here everyone is a bitcoin lover, so it is biased opinion.

There is not much more to understand. You hold an asset with high value and high volatility/risk, because future is blur.

The most important things always are a friction between what is thought and what really is. There have to be many middlemenon the top of bitcoin if it has to suceed. The equal rules are important, but it is the "core". It means that instead of central (bank) interventions there is demand and supply. But on the top of the money there will be middlemen as they are on the top of the fiat money. Even bitcoin will have bitcoin-banksters.

Again. It is exponencial growth. You are picking up random date and yes, it is true. But it is also true that more people/businesses w/ money are involved during last year than 3 years ago.
The 2K by 2017 is then realistic estimation. I am very pro-btc from June 2011, but sadly I had other biz, so started to buy in early 2015, but nothing changed during the past 5 years. Btc is in the early stage and economy is before hard collapse/transition.
@_date: 2016-09-18 20:46:59
I think those predictions can become true. But everything depends on economy and central banks. If we see (further) negative interest rates (which is probable) and no recovery of economy (which is almost certain), those scenarios above can happen.

Address is not a person. I do not believe we are closer to egalitarian state. Just the big owners do not possess addresses with huge amounts. Once they pay from such address, there are 2 addresses with smaller amount. that is just it.
FYI fiat exists exactly because with fiat states can redistribute wealth through taxes, inflation and hard resets of currency. With cc, the money seizures or tricks will be almost impossible, so the rich people = the ones with some edge, will be even richer than in fiat economy, where always resets occur so the politicians can always throw some pennies to the poor.
@_date: 2016-09-03 20:40:44
Thanks for reply. I do not think still this makes much sense. Huge bitcoin balances have to be stored in own coldwallet where private key is mine. Then the pennies that are moved around can be stored at Coinbase or whenever and I do not care if it is hacked.
It is like with my credit card. I do not care about security of my cc. If it is hacked, then fine. I will lose couple of thousands max and probably recover them back. So I do not need some top security there. But I need to have max security to my main balances in banks.
This multisig solution looks like a simplification for people, that desparately want to have just one balance at one place and that place is not their own wallet.

So you should return sometimes not to forget your roots.
There is ROI of money and ROI of work. The ROI of money is depleted, bc many people think in the american way. There is no value for me. I always had much more money than I needed and much less time. Tradeoff beween money and time does not work. Money is not just a tool, it is much more. It does not also work everywhere as in USA. In most parts of the world debts are taken deadly serious. In most parts of the world when you go bust, your life busts as well. Also: handling debts is also aprt of the life.
I understand that approach of yours in a way. because everyone is in debtin some way. Money itself is a debt. Even bitcoin is. I do not like the approach of debtless people that falsely think they are indeoendent without debt and such bullshit.
But simply there are a way how to profit now a lot without "pure credit" in modern economy. You better trust me. I believe the debt way works in a way too, but just reached limits.
@_date: 2016-09-18 21:53:52
Are they really? Your money - be it fiat or bitcoin is not yours. They are medium of exchange only if other people accept that. It may be nice to have only bitcoins but it is simply unreasonable for most businesses atm. Another currency that does not work like fiat means extra costs for the vendors. Therefore vendors must have some advantage in bitcoin use to justify those costs.
Comments like yours are contraproductive. Bitcoin has many negative connotations, because other people think that bitcoin is some weird wannabe currency for weirdos who think that possesing btc gives them freedom or some other fancy nonsense. Bitcoin is just independent protocurrency, but it does not mean that it makes people independent, free or something like that. We live together on one planet and we trade. Dependant on each other. Money do not make people free. On the top bitcoins too are dependant on many other factors: from chinese miners to FED decision to raise or not raise rates.

This makes no sense. Price of money/bitcoin is almost not affected by me. It is affected by market. And market is sum of all players. Including FED, Chinese miners, prices of electricity in Island, R&amp;D and development of new chips. Even crop quality in Bangladesh has probably higher impact on btc price than me going full retard and demand at Tesco cashier to accept my bitcoin.
You should shut up and think. Bitcoin is independent currency, but it does not make people independent. It actually makes people even more dependent, because market swings can hurt you badly. Fiat has many disadvantages, but there is oen advantage: central banks into some extent can protect stupid people who risk too much from those swings. You are the one who is killing bitcoin (and yourself). 
Bitcoin has many uses. There are new niches for bitcoin now. But no, it is not buying stuff of everyday use (unless you have some troubles, but even then you need fiat debit card [=you do not pay in btc] and pay fees for that). I am happy here for the upvotes, because it shows that bitcoin users are not all idiots.
@_date: 2016-09-15 20:38:20
You are in bitcoin thread. That is why here is the hate. Bitcoin is a symbol of hard cash. Irony is that if bitcoin has to suceed, the credit will be in btc economy as well.
But I must admit I always had much more money than I needed. Even when I was very poor. It is quite easy with pure work to get a decent bank from ~0. And then the second million is always easier :) I mean if I am at 0 again, I do not see another/easier way how to make a bank with credit than with pure work. Yes, I would not be able to hire people for example. But my people work for me in an extremely hard way, because they know that I will always pay them and find some other work for them. I can not guarantee anything to other people if I am personally unstable and indebted and then their work is not that outstanding. And without outstanding work one is not the winner (that in recent economy takes all). I do not need average people to give me average work and then to pay off average interest to collect average profit.
@_date: 2016-09-18 15:29:05
I like your approach. But the most conservative technical approach ~25% p.a. is not medium risk/medium reward. It is still high risk/high reward compared to other opportunities. It is not just the ultra high risk.
It also means that one can invest relatively larger bankroll into btc, right. The biggest threat for bitcoin is some software glitch I believe. And longer bitcoin exists, the lesser is the probability of complete bust. Also that (only in the conservative approach that we consider here) the smaller is probablity of abrupt surge from some run, the smaller is probability of huge decline.
@_date: 2016-09-13 11:04:52
Yes, they like to make senseless statements and laws. There is no proof that anyone is holder of bitcoins for one year, unless the bitcoins sit at one address or maybe if they sit at third party account (but then again, is the 3rd party holder or me, because the third party had private keys).
Those are the bitcoin law traps. I am sure there will be much more of them.

I agree with Coinosphere. There need to be high value and stability for merchants to adopt btc. It was the initial ideal, that the holders and users of btc will be the same people. Although I use btc a lot, I am much bigger hodler. But there are also many people that are just pure users of btc and they are scared to hold. Bitcoin needs both hodlers and users.
The idealistic view where you can support bitcoin only by selling some etsy type bullshit is way off. Bitcoin so far has sense in anonymous / nonreversible paymens, drugs, gambling, tax evasion. That is market big enough. That market desperately need hodlers. Also hodlers are needed for the value that will be bought by ETF/hedge funds. After they start buying, the bitcoin will be even more stable and more used.

Hey, you should really visit Europe for more than a few days. I am almost 40, never had cc and have a lot of money. I did not steal them.
There is a possibility to make money without credit, just with work. Tbh it is very hard. But it is possible. It is not about handling credit geez. It is just the mindset that you can make big money from small money with a lot of work. It is about much more discipline than "just" handling the credit. By not having cc, you do not limit yourself. Having cc is the limiting factor: you tend to be lazy, where you can work more. Sometimes less tools is just better. It is better to think about more effective ways how to do things than begging for money and lose the time with begging and be afraid of debts when things go wrong.

I really do not know why you suddenly talk about ATH. There is nothing special about that event. ATH is not a special event (it is special only to people who want to argue that ATH is not now and therefore btc is declining). What I said is true. People are usually (=most of times) right, if they claim that bitcoin has to appreciate at pace like 3 folds in 12-18 months.
There was simply only one year of correction of too steep growth (20x). On average bitcoin is rising many times each year from the beginning.

I think most people can fuck the software wallet security more than hardware (you have to decrypt harddisk and many other things come into my mind). But if you are careful enough then there are only advantages of not using HW wallet (for example if you have computer / memory stick, nobody knows that there are bitcoins, unlike with Trezor).

Bitcoin still can lose 100%. Always is there possibility of some glitch.
100K to btc is nothing. Kraken is the place to recommend, but first go to forex and trade GBP to EUR, because EUR is the Kraken main market. My SEPA payments are done the same day. To exchange 100K (USD ~ 90K EUR = daily limit) takes usually less than 2 hours, sometimes much faster. Even when I am selling fiat not buying BTC (so the price is slightly better).
But ofc to hold some high DD % of bank in btc is just crazy. Unless the overall bank is very low (or very high :)

You again. Even all the downvotes from people who (probably) have bitcoins do not change your mind even a bit. Yeah: only you have your truth about real bitcoin. That bitcoin is probably not possible to exchange to fiat right? People who want to spend btc are traitors.
Without possibility to freely exchange btc to fiat the value of btc would be 0 forever or until the recent system goes down. And the recent system seems to be more persistent that we thought. Why do not you simply accept reality, that bitcoin develops through natural market forces? Nobody gives a shit about your clean ideals.

I do not think this is a problem. Even bitcoin economy will be/would be fractional reserve system, where monetary base is "real bitcoin". Gold standard worked like that in 19th century. But there is a difference here: everyone can always redeem real bitcoin for the IOU. Yes, this system is much less stable, with much more runs on banks etc, but it is not possible to do otherwise if credit has to be here. And modern economy is based on credit and those economies that use credit are more developed and won the evolution (only the game went too far).

I think it means potencially decentralised in all meanings about bitcoin. Just the threat that the currency *can* decentralise at some costs (on level of miners or on level as currency) is the trick.
It is a little bit similar to the theory of monopoly, where the monopoly can stay at monopolist position, because just threat that they will lower the price if newcomer enters the market, causes that no newcomer to the market emerge.
I think for "decentralised" currency is not that important the actual level of decentralisation (that will be always costly in some way), but the ability to change the shape into more decentralised state.
PS. Our nicknames look pretty similar :)

DM after WWII yes, but by then it was not the first world country, but country totally in ruins. There was no order to keep. The measures there were to create the order and it was a success.
I do not know this exactly (the date), but until 80/90s there was no free float! So any change by definition was "by force" (not government but rathercentral bank, but that is rather a detail). There were a fixed exchange rates. 1st Bretton-Wood until 70s, but even after Bretton Wood there were fixed rates. But any change in the fixed rates were not resets. It was just following the market forces with delay and inaccurately.

There are plenty of people who trust fiat money and they do not feel they were pressed into accepting it. They usually even think fiat money have some inner value (e.g. gold backed, or state backed &amp; that states do not fail). They also think that this kind of money is "natural".
And if cryptocurrncies have to be adopted on massive scale, those people are be the ones that will feel they were forced to accept the cryptocurrency as money. And even if it is silly humanity is far from trusting into some set of software rules. Most people will rather trust governments even when they know they are being cheated.
So hopefully for bitcoin, Hayek was not right.

@_date: 2016-10-18 16:02:01
It would, if other things unchanged. But the point is that the other things would be changed by politicians.
Also this growth would not make just fiat scarer, but also resources like land, food, water... So maybe the equillibrium would be faster to reach, because the excessive money will be used there. But it is really just "nonsensical thought experiment".
I think for USD the last QE raised the monetary base by 400%. But 400% was just the last raise. I think it was in Adam Curtis - All Watched Over by Machines of Loving Grace, that in mid 90s (Clinton era) the trick came here first. Greenspan saw that we are in shit and started to *excessively* print money. Then came dotcom bubble. Then the last QE. This is like a hype over hype over hype. The problem is, like in socialism, that relative prices makes no sense and effectivity goes to shit. The newly printed money do not reflect scarcity. Overall it is muddling through, but each new round is just more ineffectiveness.

Winning a war nowadays means that one has to take care of the citizens (Iraq fail) + wars interrupt international trade, which is immediate lose-lose situation (Russia). So this is why we do not see wars yet thank god.
Forced debt relief is hard to imagine (creditors are usually banks that are already on the verge of collapse).
Financial repression is already in place and will be stronger, but probably never big enough.
The only way out will be hyperinflation I guess (maybe steady mid- to high DD inflation will be enough, question will be if it comes out of control or not).
But I do not think this can be nonviolent. All the people from middle classes that live their modest lives both with mortgages and pension funds will be very disappointed. They will maybe get rid of some debts, but they will lose all social securities around which their lives exist. I think there will be bigger problems than money, it will be vanishing of trust in general. There were flashes of untrust in 2008/2009, politicians shitted into pants and did everything to avoid that. So people forgot and trust again. For now.

Inflation of course will come. In cycle as always, but the cycle will not be the reason. The reason will be that central banks will give up after they exhaust economies with negative interest rates in the future and civil unrest will force the change.

Sure. But this never happened with major currencies and economies in post-war economy (with USD even before). It would be not just reset of currency (like in Latin America), it would be a reset of the whole political and economical system. There is a diference between 1st world and the rest. The social order of 1st world is based on trust and gentle steps. This reset will/would cross a line. I think the politicians will realize that better way is a sneaky way through high inflation.
Also reset without failed currency, that would be something that never happened. (After hyperinflation there is no need for reset, just denomination is good enough.)
Last note. Even if we agree there is a real estate/housing bubble now, if we go through some inflation or reset, then the bubble was not bubble and all the houses bought now would still be a decent investment. Maybe with minus ROI, but much better than cash.

Yes, I confirm that. I live in Brazil as foreigner and I have the bank accounts. Currently the advantage is much lower, but better than cc. The hidden costs is your time, where you can do something productive than dealing with lazy brazilians in every sector of this incredibly stupid country. But when I need money here, then those costs are everywhere.
There are indeed costs to exchange BRL into USD. There are more exchange rates (unfavourable ofc, so I think the premium of bitcoin is here, because actually btc is a good way how to get relatively cheap and hassle-free usd for gridlocked Brazilians) and if you are caught by someone, the taxes are big (much bigger than the btc arbitrage profit).

I am not lying to anybody, just not talking about amounts. Promoting btc from 2011. I am owner of btc unrelated forum, but it is about money. I talk about it w/ other people too. Many people got rich bc of that.
Overall I confirm a) and b). But life is a battle. It is not about bitcoin. Anything I talk about people usually stare at me like if I am an alien. But since I am thank god much more wealthy, they do not say anything recently, that piss me off. But I am just buying even for them, because it is obvious that when this bubble pops, I will have to take care of many people.
I was also able to persuade my employees. I forced them to convert part of their salaries into btc. I will pay them now partly in btc. I also persuaded one programmer-girl, who was sure btc is a scam. Now she is a trader, but I think she had some money at Finex, so idk how she is.

This was talked many times over. There are more trade-offs. High volume of transaction means higher costs and/or higher centralisation.

There are niches for natural monopolies and there are not such niches. There is generally no mono- or poly- world. The dictature of polytony is the same s dictature of monotomy.
Platinum and copper are far from money. The duality of gold and silver is an exception of money that existed before fiat. As a gold hoarder I do not think gold will progress as money, it is just obsolete to give value into something we must be able to touch.
Money were always natural monopolies at their geographical markets. Since states are not so important in global economy, there is just one monetary market and that market needs the exctly one currency.

I agree, but the 1% in and out is not always true. It really depends on market(s). Can be much more or much less.
For example Kraken buy starts I think at .24% buy and .14% sell. SEPA deposits are free. So the price from EU area for btc is competitive.
Then it depends on destination market. There are many IIIrd world countries where you can sell btc with premium. There are certainly markets where this is not true. There are markets that do not have liquidity so time should be considered. Also if btc would be used more, the advantages and disadvantages would both level up.
Even when I am using btc to move money to 3rd world country (with premium), I think at least now it is not general remittance tool.
And the poster from above is pure scam that has potencial to hurt bitcoin.

I think you are little bit too paranoid. "They" might know you bought bitcoin and they might know the addresses. But if you move them around a bit nobody will have proof that you are still the bitcoin owner. Even if things go much further than now, this seems to be too paranoid. But it was not your question.
So if you want to be tha paranoid, I think lb w/ewallets is safe. For example it is against Skrill TOS to buy btc with that but yet many people sell btc over Skrill. They will not report it ever as btc transaction.
There are still a lot of countries where cash is usual, if you really need it. East Europe for example.

I just do not agree. We are not in 80s. Cryptos are not the only revolution around. Information exchange multiplied in extreme numbers and just small information advantage now via scaling up causes that usually just one person or group swallows the whole opportunity.
I love bitcoin, but it will be a disaster for average people. For average people fiat system with redistribution (soft socialism) is better. But it is inevitable to abandon it.
Many young people tend to look for the solution that will bring only good things and for everyone. Such solutions are rare or maybe inexistent. If cryptos are being pushed further we will just see acceleration of current tendencies in economy (deflation economy, scaling down debt, higher inequality, more stratified society).
@_date: 2016-10-13 17:36:40

They want to cause inflation for evaporation, but it does not happen. The way how the money can evaporate is thru bankruptcies of banks, but that is exactly what will not be allowed.

Yeah. That is what I said. Until 80s there were fixed rates, so normal depreciation - as we know it now - was impossible. There was just devaluation. Plus somewhere in the beginning of 80 there was another fixed rates mechanism called ERM (only for currencies that later created Euro). So even after floating was introduced, it was never a full float. Sometimes this system of dirty float is called "a snake in the tunnel".

That is just false. Average Joe can invest even now. But because he is just average, he can not evaluate informations properly, so only the smartest and/or the sharpest guys get the cake (in fact average Joe is so dumb, that he is living on credit instead of saving money). And once they get the cake, they have more money, so they can afford better informations etc. This is the circle of capitalism and if bitcoin succeeds, then this circle will be even more obvious.
The recent system helps to average Joes at least a bit. So when those Joes are stupid enough, the recent system can redistribute money even through monetary policy. This will not work if Bitcoin is adopted. Average Joe will be far deeper in shithole than in recent version of soft capitalism.

All currencies are being printed. The question is why the price level/inflation is still stable (= why all fiat currencies are so strong). The same question is valid for central bankers that desperately try to cause some inflation (with questionable hope that the inflation will start growth).
I think there are many answers for the q, why all currencies are still strong. But the key is that most of the money printed do not tough real economy (yet). They are printed and invested into some bubble assets. In a way it is the same kind of money, like the 1M btc of Satoshi. They are as good as nonexistent, because they will never tough a market. Those newly printed money touch only a speculative market and there one can see price hike.
How and when this will affect real market is hard to predict.It can happen soon or never (Japan). It can be steady or abrupt. But one thing is certain: hodling a bitcoin is a hedge for almost any situation. E.g. FED will raise, USD goes up, CNY goes down, bitcoin wins. Or. FED does not raise or go into negative, USD plummets, bitcoin wins as safe haven.

Sorry, it is not a reset. GBP was over 2 usd few years ago, now 1.2. If what you say is reset, then the reset happened just now with GBP via market forces. (Even bigger swing was at GBP/CHF pair). It is just fluctuation that does not bring major collapse for individuals and companies. Some goods are cheaper, some more expensive, but for most this levels up and it is business as usual. What happened after WWII was just devaluation, because there was no currency floating, so it was in bigger steps and centrally planed. Now currencies usually float (not CZK for example), so we have depreciations (and those depreciations overall can be pretty big as well as economies and other things change).

Fair. Fair enough. Many people, those who vote, would probably say that the fair system is something much more even (for God's sake I am not telling that). This is why fiat system where the power of central banks is abused exists. I strongly disagree with the fact that fiat money system is here (only) for banksters. It is here, because when some central authority has power over money and unequality is too high, they can do at least something (not much recently).
What I am trying to say that there is a part of "leftist bitcoiners" that believe, that Bitcoin will bring more equality, as *they* imagine it. It is not true and I can see big frictions if this ever happens. With truly independent currency there will be no more possible stte interventions. nd as I said above: state is not just a power of the wealthy, it is way too simple. State is also power of the poor and this is valid more and more now, when states go towards socialism and interventions.

Certainly not because only Bitcoin was not created by greed. I mean, it is true that Bitcoin originally was without greed, but that is just irrelevant for Bitcoin adoption. Free market does not care about morality, intentions etc.
The reason why altcoins trend down is - s OP said - the network effect. Some of them are certainly worse than btc, some of them maybe have at least potencial to be technically better. But even those things do not matter, as greedy intentions do not matter. What matters is the network effect = [natural monopoly](

I used "some" in a meaning "at least some". Sure it means "the right inflation". And yes, they are causing "the wrong inflation".

That is something else. They talk about WinPoker that is part of iPoker network (the bookies join into networks to have liquidity in poker).
Tbh I also think WH does not accept btc and it si a bullshit, but wanted to see if someone can confirm that.
Accepting bitcoin via neteller I think can not be considered as accepting bitcoin. then even the bitcoin prepaid cards that convert bitcoins into fiat would be "bitcoin payments".

Then I really do not know how I became rich (it really was not a bitcoin).

If one can not save fiat, she/he will not save bitcoin. It reminds me the people that are unable to save money, so they go to ATM 3x a day for 10 bucks and pay 1 for each withdrawal.

Sure. I do not argue with that. I just argue that there are exchanges with much less (or much more) commission. So no matter where the market is by price 600 your price might be also 601.
1% exchange fees do not allow cheaper remittance services than non-blockchain technology in most cases I agree. But lower exchange fees can be a game changer.
