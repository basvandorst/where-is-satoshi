You are assuming a lot of things with that statement. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:09:58
No. That's silly. You guys need to worry about the infrastructure and regulations and the use throughout the world. 
The price is volatile. That's all. It won't go to zero "just because". There would have to be a real reason, like the US suddenly arresting people for possessing it.

So their introduction to bitcoins will be that instead of writing you a check, they have to sign up on some sketchy site they have never heard of, and send in their personal and banking data and then order bitcoins, which they have no idea about, and then figure out how to transfer them to you... so you can use them.
They could do all this and still have literally no idea what bitcoins are or what the hell they just did.
This is a terrible idea and stuff like this makes bitcoins into a sad geeky joke. If we want btc to be treated like a currency, *we* need to treat it like a currency. You're making it into some sort of novelty. 
Also this event is about your life with this woman. Romance and crypto-currencies don't sound like the best mix to me.
All just my opinion... wish you the best either way, in marriage and in bitcoining.

It's not a flaw with bitcoin (IMO). It's a flaw with the surrounding technology. 
If you lose a $100 bill, odds are you aren't getting it back. Especially if you lose it in a fire. 
The difference with money is you store any sizable amount in a bank. 
We just don't have a reliable bitcoin banking industry yet. Regular banks are audited and regulated and assets are in trust and secure from creditors. We need that in our world.

You are assuming QE will continue when it is already tapering and will end at a point. You are assuming that it will drag on the dollar - if that were true it would have happened 2-3 years ago. 
And you are assuming that bitcoins will be materially affected by any of these.
Buy bitcoins if you think they are a neat ancillary way of storing and spreading wealth. If you think they offer some technological solutions to transacting money.
That alone can make them worth 5k a coin one day. 
@_date: 2013-11-05 16:06:34
You are absolutely correct. I make good money working in IT and yet I am in over my head with a lot of this.
Think of it this way: when you transfer money from your bank account to another person's bank account, there are a thousand technical computer actions that occur. You never need to worry about it. If this thing ever gets really accepted in the world, you'll see a real banking infrastructure take hold and make much of this no longer a concern.

Negative news? Damn dude where were you the last 2 years? We've had mtgox fucking up all over the place (and being 70% of the market) and large bitcoins hacks/thefts and huge regulatory questions that have since been answered somewhat favorably. And Silk Road being taken down.
And you think if an ATM doesn't get used a bunch that will have a big impact on a 2B currency?
@_date: 2013-10-11 14:42:28
Where exactly did he say he "invested money he cant ('afford' I assume you mean?) to lose?
If you order something and are promised a certain delivery date, you have a right to complain if that date is not met.
A subreddit dedicated to bitcoin is a logical place for that complaint.
If you are so touchy about all this, to the point of swearing at some guy you've never even met, maybe *you* need to rethink your priorities.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:26:27
As good as that is, we also need one that my parents could hope to understand. 
One that just says "and it is secure" and links to this one if you don't believe it. 
@_date: 2013-11-01 17:53:09
You might be right about the ATM.
But I think (a) it is completely trivial compared to the size of the bitcoin economy, and (b) I don't understand how losing something you didn't have in the first place is going to be so disastrous. 
@_date: 2013-10-24 16:11:21
Wow you must have a permanent grin. Congrats.

Well first of all, he got caught by being very dumb on a number of counts.
Secondly, even if he has a plan and a backup, etc., etc., the moment he "comes into" any money, they will surely trace back where it came from. A guy with no job/salary, living at a friend's house, can't suddenly have a million dollars for his defense without answering where it came from.
@_date: 2013-10-30 15:53:21
Well "going for" implies they each cost $1. 
Yup I sure wish I bought some then....
@_date: 2013-10-30 14:51:28
You are assuming bitcoin will be more than a memory 5 years from now. I am in the same boat as you. But it is still a big assumption. Many many factors could come along and change it all up.
@_date: 2013-11-08 14:08:43
Maybe I'm more of a noob than I thought. My coins are just in my Bitcoin Wallet app, with a pretty good, long, password.
And then I have a (cold) backup.
Am I being insecure?
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:39:43
That's a terrible way to evaluate an investment. 
First of all, what is the implication? That it always goes up or that it has peaked? 
More importantly, an investment should be judged based on the value of the underlying interest relative to other similar (in risk/reward) interests. 
What is an international, digital age, currency that can't be controlled by a government worth? And counter that with the risks inherent. 
@_date: 2013-11-04 16:53:58
Thank the good lord you're not a financial adviser.
 "I'm sure the return on [blank] will"
Yeah that's the same words every 2-bit adviser has ever said while signing people on for something way out of their risk profile. And yeah some of them meant it and believed it.
Honestly this kind of talk makes me sick. 
It is a hugely risky and volatile currency. It barely even qualifies as an investment because you own no piece of any corporation and you have no claim on any country's future debt/production. And if a few G8 nations decided to, they could easily kill the whole network. At which point, your btc won't even wallpaper your house.
I love bitcoins. I see them as one day being worth 100 times more. But let's end the shyster financial planner talk about it. It makes the whole thing look like an MLM scam.
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:01:08
Not sure you understand how bitcoins work. They can always raise the cost (in btc) if the currency drops too low.
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:46:44
Forgot that as I was typing.
Still think you are typecasting. I know plenty of "geeks" that pay for music - and not your local band that needs the support. I don't get it, but whatever.  
@_date: 2013-10-16 13:37:00
I don't know about that. Not every article ever written on bitcoin is going to get into a wikipedia-like, philosophical overview of it all. The article was about price.

In June they announced "possibly" reducing it by 20% or so in September. Then the stock market pooped itself a little so they held off on doing that. 
But the US deficit is (despite how fucked so many things are in the US and in the world) down ~50% from 2009. So you're going to see a point where that much QE purchasing is simply not needed. 
But either way, my point is that when you start guessing at macro theme stuff like that, even when you are right about an event, the odds of the outcome you predicted also being right are slim. I work in Finance and I think only 1 in 50 economists has any useful power at predicting big macro trends. And I'm not one of them. 
The dollar has already faced it's toughest tests from 2008 until now. And right now we have relative peace, lowering deficits, housing turning around and some return of manufacturing in the US. But again, I'm not worth listening to on things like this. 
My point is let's focus on bitcoin's intrinsic value. It can be moved electronically directly. No 3rd party. No other currency can do that. And it is not under control of any government. Those are big awesome achievements. 
I just don't want as a 'bitcoiner' to be labelled as (a) some sort of tinfoil anarchist end-of-the-world kook or (b) some sort of shysters 'selling' the investment opportunity of a lifetime. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:35:33
Well... limited supply yes. But each coin is divisible to a 100 millionth. Those are referred to as satoshis (after the creator, PRAISE BE HIM!). 
So in theory a satoshi could eventually be worth a penny (in theory, just crazy talk here) and then the total value of all bitcoins would be around 21 trillion dollars. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 13:07:29
You are making some big assumptions. All kinds of people pay for porn. And all kinds of people use bitcoins. You are typecasting both bitcoin users and porn users. 
Plus the webcam world is a whole other topic. In that world you are paying girls to talk to you and do things live for you. I imagine there are millions of guys around the world who are too ugly, too married, too old, to get a young pretty girl to engage them like that. Doing it via webcam and being able to tip them without your wife or parent or whoever seeing the bill is about as perfect for bitcoin as you could get.

You think he has a choice? You think every single last method of communication he has isn't being watched? 
*I* have a hard enough time selling btc and getting my money. 
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:27:52
Does that matter? 900btc is worth $200k now. 
@_date: 2013-10-23 14:32:43
And for the record, I didn't mean to attack. Just busy trying to actually work at the same time as I peruse @_date: 2013-10-28 15:47:59
Seconding this and adding: it is strange to request a specific currency. Would you decline a check for $1000 because it is in Canadian and you are in the US? If you want money, just ask for it and buy your own btc with it. Making people open accounts with websites they don't know and then wade through the whole process of buying bitcoins...wow.
@_date: 2013-10-30 13:31:33
Please don't think of it as an investment. You are buying no ownership in no company. 
It is simply a currency. That happens to not be owned by any government and can't be counterfeited or diluted. But that also is in it's infancy as far as the peripheral infrastructure goes (can be hard to change into cash rapidly and is still accepted in very few places relatively speaking).
Yes it could go way up in value. But if you are going to buy it, buy it because you like to have a variety of assets and because you think it may serve some potential purpose for you.
