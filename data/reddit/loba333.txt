Use it for what ? Right now there's no use cases other than to buy drugs or to use a 'store of value'

Sorry, I don't see how your two statements are linked in any way ? Or why posting it here is at all relevant

Oh holy shit, i did go on a bit of a porn spree the other day. Fuck, thanks man. Any good suggestions on how to do a clean with out formatting ?

Let's err forget about the mention of hashes for the layman version, don't your think :) ?
Hmm I guess I should remove the bit about Steganography then.

I've been on reddit for over 4 years, your account was registered 4 days ago. Further more if you actually bothered to analyse the file rather than spreading rumors you would see it's just PDFs representing various backtests (as stated in the post)
@_date: 2016-02-02 04:40:50
No, it's a zip file containing the results from one of our back tests.

I did my best to translate it:
Bitcoin is in countries all over the world (bittokoin sekaijū no kuni de)
Use it for shopping (Kaimono dekite) 
Send it like an email (Mēru mitai ni okurette) 
It is a totally new money invention, Right Mr Da Vinci? (masa ni atarashī okane na hatsumei kamo, ne davinchi-san)
A coin that changes the world (sekai o kaeru koin)

It's a statistical model that does exactly what a TA trader does except it does it better because it's automated. Do you refuse to believe that TA traders make money? Do you take no notice in the weather forecast because they attempt to predict the future ? 
Are we asking for money ? no .... we are looking for addition partners in our operation that have an expertise in certain fields as help improve our model and optimize for trading on the alt coin markets. 
@_date: 2016-10-22 18:22:17
OKcoin's CNY market's volume bars are nothing more than colourful rectangles. Trading is free and therefore they can create fake volume

Please explain why this is getting downvoted?

Well then the model learns and finds patterns in the bots behavior. The ROI is within the document, if you read it. 
This is going to be a changeling posting this to Reddit without them thinking we're scamming.

It makes bad trades. Everytime it makes a bad trade it learns and adds weights. It is continually learning, continually adapting.

I want an interface that i can load my signals into that makes the trades. I am familiar with python, i'm not proficient at it.

oh wait im an idiot, that's tick data. Regardless, that's a tedious process to convert it to OHLC
@_date: 2017-06-20 08:07:30
Thanks. How did you extract the data ? Because it seems like it only has 3 groups of data, seems like date, close, volume:
       1364767668  93.250000000000  12.671482050000
    0  1364767669             93.3        80.628518
    1  1364767693            100.0        20.000000
    2  1364767694            100.0         1.000000
    3  1364767696            100.0         5.900000
@_date: 2017-06-20 11:56:12
Well that was easy enough:
    import pandas as pd
    
    df = pd.read_csv('finex2')
    df['date'] = pd.to_datetime(df['date'], unit='s')
    df = df.set_index('date', drop=True)
    
    result = df['price'].resample('10Min', how='ohlc')
    result['vol'] = df['vol'].resample('10Min').sum()
    
    result.to_csv('5min')

Yeah good idea. I guess it depends on the complexity of my password to encrypt the wallets in that really the only attack vector with my method is the password being brute forced. Sigh ... I wanted a simple password so my parents would remember it haha

Thanks for the reply. This is the first thing I checked, it doesn't. Also I could just nuke my USB rather than destroy it right ?
