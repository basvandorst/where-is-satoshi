Then they are more likely to make bad decisions in life and if they don't learn from their mistakes, others will.  That's how nature operates. Your life becomes either a warning or an example.

If people are doing the best they can with whatever information they have it means they have to use reason, so things undeniably happen for a reason.

The problem is not who is elected, the problem is giving one's power away to somebody else to begin with. So it's precisely those idiots who should unite, except that they are distracted by political drama thinking it's happening somewhere "out there", never realizing that they are part of the problem.

The matrix started when humans realized they can "take matters into their own hands" and turn themselves into actors: play kings, knights, bishops and so on. Then things got out of hand and we forgot who started it all, so we blame each other in an endless battle to the top of the mountain to claim the title of Mr right.

No, you don't understand how reddit works. Its sorting system favors content which is upvoted fast, it's not just about the score. A post which got 5 upvotes in 1 minute is ranked higher than another post which gained the same amount of upvotes in 5 minutes. Think of it like every upvote buying you a little time on the frontpage - yet, less and less as the submission gets older.
That's why image macros and gifs rise to the top (which feeds them back into the loop and they get even more upvotes) and articles and self posts often get buried. That's because articles, even if they get more upvotes, are very often ranked lower because unlike funny pictures, people had to take time to read them and they didn't get a high score fast enough. is absolutely right that is the reason why the best subreddits have so much moderation. 


That's a huge oversimplification.

SEPA is for transfers in euro, not pounds. It's likely that you paid a fee for conversion, you have to consult that with your bank. I've always paid €1 for SEPA transfers from any of my euro accounts. I hope that's helpful.

You didn't read my post at all. I wasn't saying anything about the "point" of upvotes. I merely explained to you how the sorting system works. I didn't even complain about memes and that's your counterpoint? Clearly you don't know how to discuss. I'm out.

If it makes you feel better, I transferred my money like a half a minute after my bank's last outgoing session yesterday (SEPA), expecting a crash today. I would make it in time but my Internet was down. Obviously the money is not on the exchange yet... Otherwise I would be buying the shit out of this price. I bet it will all be over on Monday. I think the price is recovering already. FML

There are smartphones with open source operating systems like Android or better yet AOSP based ROMs. Malware there is limited to the apps you install yourself or proprietary hardware drivers. I'd say it's a hell of a lot better than nothing.

When everyone else is panic selling, I just wish it would keep dropping or at least stay like this till Monday, when I finally have some money on the exchange...

Ok, all I'm saying is people are rather reluctant to give out their addresses and there's absolutely nothing on your site that would encourage them to do so. It doesn't matter if you want to profit off this project. I suggested a blog because you can post your analysis online and people can see what they are signing up for. It also helps with being indexed by search engines.

I know, self validation, image macros, etc. It's repetitive and it's boring. Probably time for something like already then, unless moderators will be able to deal with this. There is always stuff like bitcoinmarkets or bitcoinnews for those less emotionally involved. As long as that there are people like you and me, there will be some decent place for discussion. I said it will pass because the bitcoin craze will not continue forever. Unless of course it will really take off this time, then it will hardly matter because we'll all be rich, haha!

Well, if there were already 21 million BTC in existence, and there are about 1.2 trillion USD in circulation ([I was looking for some specific data and found this, not sure how accurate that is]( then 1 BTC would have to reach the value of ~$58 000 (64x current value of $900) to reach the same capacity as USD. I'm not sure what else I should take into account but otherwise these calculations seem to make sense. I only have like one semester of Economics so take it with as much salt as you please, lol - it's probably more complicated than that. Anyway, technically I suppose it could at some point amount to or even surpass 100x its current value but it would have to replace all of the existing currencies in the entire world. Whether that's possible and when it might happen is a completely different topic I'm not sure I want to discuss yet ;)

From my experience, it's always there on the next business day if you transfer it before afternoon (it depends on your bank's outgoing sessions, mine's last one is at 13:30). Anyway, very fast.

I registered at Kraken yesterday but they have yet to verify me (2nd tier). Anyone has a clue how long it might take? I'm curious only because the first tier took only a couple of minutes and the 2nd one is stuck at processing.

You shouldn't expect people to just blindly give you their e-mail addresses in good faith. That's not how it works - offer something first, otherwise it looks like a scam. Start a blog, add subscriptions as a bonus.

I don't se how you disagree with me then. That's precisely one of the reasons why subreddits have their rules and moderators. You are free to vote and voice your opinions but ultimately, subreddit's moderators choose the criteria that they believe the content should meet. People don't pay close attention to what they upvote and where. This is even in the reddit faq - [Why does reddit need moderation? Can't you just let the voters decide?](
Some people want to leave memes out of because they believe that, as a default sub, its primary quality should be information instead of entertainment.

Apparently you can when it comes to bitcoin. When I registered roughly 2 weeks ago they had an average volume of 150 BTC, now they are reaching 800. I'm not surprised, their service is really, really good.

No, no, no... switch to anything you want, just PLEASE, not for Requiem For a Dream. It's the single most overplayed tune in the history of Internet. Immediately makes me think worse of any video I see it with, it's terribly unoriginal and I know I'm not alone in this line of thinking. I think I would rather hear some bad music than this...
I believe Clubbed to Death is perfect because it has that cyber punk feel to it - and I wouldn't say it's overplayed. That being said, I'm a huge fan of The Matrix so I'm very biased. Then again, that's definitely the kind of people you might want to appeal to!
@_date: 2013-12-02 23:12:36
Volume is normally calculated for the last 24 hours so I don't know what your 50 BTC in a week has to do with it. Anyway I didn't say 800 is an astronomical sum, what it means is 500% growth over a short period of time. At this rate Kraken will have a decent volume in no time.
@_date: 2013-12-16 19:47:59
This guy is right. probably confused it with score fuzzing which is a completely different thing. The sorting algorithm is not based on the score alone but also age of subsequent votes.
