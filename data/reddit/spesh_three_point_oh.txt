I mean, May 2017 was the most recent May. I'm not sure you needed to include the year.

What if I did the opposite? It's that kosher?
@_date: 2018-09-09 01:34:56
That's great for people that have bitcoins. Does it actually help society?  Honest question...
@_date: 2017-12-28 02:35:07
That's what people told me years ago and ultimately the reason I didn't mine BTC then. 
I regret that.

And a British pound is still worth a British pound

On do people that drive nice cars manage this grave risk to their life and well-being? 
@_date: 2019-03-01 20:21:02
Amantes off of baseline. Go to town buddy. 
@_date: 2019-03-02 22:34:07
That's a very bad comparison, and I think even you know it.

@_date: 2018-06-15 23:57:09
Yeah I'm not so sure about that
@_date: 2018-06-10 17:51:36
Wait... What do you mean??
@_date: 2018-06-10 18:17:32
Invest them into what exactly?
@_date: 2018-06-27 05:26:31
Relax. Go back to work. 
@_date: 2018-06-12 21:21:09
If you have to ask...
@_date: 2019-02-28 14:21:18
Paranoid much? 
@_date: 2019-02-28 10:57:52

I agree to an extent, but you don't HAVE to only view this through the climate change lens. The idea that every where you look in society, humans are decentralizing... It's fascinating. 
@_date: 2019-01-05 06:39:47
Sorta the same. Except the part it's not
@_date: 2018-03-10 21:25:54
That's amazing
@_date: 2019-01-02 02:08:15
Only a little off
@_date: 2018-02-07 19:29:46
I think this is a vastly oversimplified version of the events.  There are real people that write and edit. Yes, there's outside influence, but the goal of these media companies isn't always just some sort of political agenda, the goal is revenue (of the business, IE traffic...eyeballs)

I too like a good IPA or 10 
@_date: 2018-02-17 15:55:10
This is the exact opposite of communism
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:47:42
Well Ok then
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:40:47
Can you share some examples for me?
@_date: 2018-02-17 16:06:19
The only place I see him arguing for this is in terms of net neutrality. As far as everything else, he's arguing for the exact opposite
@_date: 2018-07-12 12:18:15
I don't understand what the purpose could possibly be
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:52:09
Oh we're just going to be negative today? That's what we're doing?
@_date: 2018-12-27 17:40:38
Basically he has a huge following that has zero to do with Bitcoin. So by virtue of this, he's potentially introducing Bitcoin to a whole new group of users.
