I've seen people with this problem and once u/bitinstant showed up and people gave him the order ID he had put it through within minutes.
@_date: 2013-04-09 18:01:59
Awesome! When can I expect to see my funds?
@_date: 2013-04-11 12:52:16

Yup still nothing.  Will post an update in an hour.
@_date: 2013-04-08 14:46:32
I thought it goes without saying(obviously not) that I've contacted all parties involved multiple times..(zipzap, bitinstant, mt. gox) and none have responded.  
@_date: 2013-04-09 23:44:09
I still have no funds in my account.  Can you help me out?
@_date: 2013-04-09 19:16:23
Still not seeing anything, are you sending a email code or are the funds going to my account?
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:29:17
I've been ignored for about 2 weeks on here by user bitinstant after he told me my money would show up in one hour.. Don't trust bitinstant they have a horrible track record.
@_date: 2013-04-12 19:28:01
WHERE IS MY MONEY????
