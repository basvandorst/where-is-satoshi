I'll have to move on to stripe like others suggested. Hopefully this won't happen
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:01:23
Oh very cool! I will sign up for this =)
I make [leather wallets](
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:44:26
I will give them a shot! Thank you

I'm converting back to BTC and moving all of it to a wallet on coinbase now. All else fails, I will see if I can just accept BTC directly to a personal wallet.

It integrates via shopify, not sure if there is a good way to manage this
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:44:53
Thanks for the heads up, that seems dumb on my part.
@_date: 2016-06-03 06:54:24
For sure, setup was a snap. I'm waiting to see if there are any issues sweeping  into my bank account. Should know in a few days
@_date: 2016-06-03 06:55:47
No, you can hold as either. But you are right about withholding revenue. Bitpay just sits on it and collects interest.

I would argue that payment processing companies hurting small business is pretty toxic.


Here's OP's due dilligence you mention:  where it states a $100 minimum balance for CAD (not $1000 that was just imposed). I have been using them just fine for about a year until they imposed this arbitrary settlement a few days ago.


In order for BTC to grow, the community should be helping people like me accept and trade it. Not collect it as an investment.


I came here asking for advice; not really interested in holding hands with a company that steals from me.

Why haven't you moved to another provider? Or do you just move BTC into a different wallet?
@_date: 2016-06-03 15:03:27
Who do you use now?
@_date: 2016-06-03 03:45:16
going with suggestion of coinbase
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:25:17
wait, stripe does BTC??
@_date: 2018-10-22 01:30:59
I just thought it was interesting and a sign of the times. 
Unless you live in my backwater town, I doubt any of that information is useful to you. 
You could reach out to the company if you're that interested, it's plastered on the machine in the photo. ��‍♂️

Definetly did not buy 50 BTC at any point. Just plain odd. Will try your tip
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:55:27
That's right, wondering how this appeared though. I honestly have no idea.
@_date: 2016-06-03 04:35:09
Hmm interesting, will check this out
@_date: 2017-01-10 08:56:00
That is also unconfirmed. Maybe I was fucking around somehow? It was 4 years ago
@_date: 2017-01-10 17:14:38
Aw shit! You're amazing! That makes so much sense now
@_date: 2018-10-22 18:35:10
It is!
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:28:20
I bout 0.02 BTC on the dip, am I doing this right?
