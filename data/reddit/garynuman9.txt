Look at how many people on here *tried* to withdraw well before this past month and were unable to. I hardly call that standing by your customers  or doing the right thing for them. Gox was crooked as hell.
Also doing the right thing is easy to do when you're doing it in interest of preserving what should of been a wildly profitable exchange. He's no saint even if somehow it turns out he's not a crook.

That reads like a SJW tumblr. Talk about a terrible, biased, unresearched article.

Your forgetting the swipe card for his office building as well. Regardless I take your point.

Clearly point two is fucking insane though, right? How was that ever proposed seriously as a solution? **WHY** wouldn't you look into the issue to see what was causing so many transactions to be reissued. It's just crazy. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 17:24:39
Oh not at all. I didn't use gox but I of course understand how shitty those that had anything in there must feel right now.

Wait. So if he's verifying the draft document was "basically correct" that means the 744,000 BTC "lost" is correct. I mean otherwise he would have refuted that **very significant** point. I am still at a loss to understand how such a thing is even possible. Apparently I'm more careful with token amounts of dogecoin than one of the largest exchanges was with hundreds of millions of *other peoples* bitcoin?!? Regardless **how is an accounting error of such scale possible? Incompetence cannot explain such a fucking absurd number!**

See that's what I don't understand...
- My personal understanding of cold storage and, also, how I use it, is having an offline wallet in either paper form or on a USB drive. This wallet cannot be accessed remotely or automatically, it requires physical effort to transfer those coins to an online or working wallet. Clearly they couldn't have been using actual cold storage- more likely a "hot" working wallet that paid transactions and a reserve, but still online, wallet that held the bulk of their coins. I do not see any way a loss of that magnitude could go without being caught using *actual* cold storage, regardless of how bad their record keeping was... I don't even really understand how it could go unnoticed using a kludge like the one I proffered either- that's just too big of a sum...
 - transaction mailability, if they really lost *that* much due to it does anyone work there? Seriously. Assuming the support tickets filed automatically, with no human intervention, repaid claims don't you catch that after a few weeks **at the absolute most** when you look at your reports and notice a **huge** number of support tickets over unpaid transactions? Would you not look into that? I mean as a business they have to pay taxes at the very least, someone has to be keeping the books to some extent. There just *is not* any reasonable explanation for losing that amount without catching it *ages* ago...

Why the fuck does this pants on head retarded idiot seem to believe that ANYONE would touch a company that somehow managed to lose all of the one thing it was expected to care for? 
"Oh you only owe $500 million in bitcoin liabilities? Well at least you have a reputation for being run by incompetent idiots and poor customer services. I'm on board, who do I make the check out to?"

Karapeles confirmed via the IRC conversation that the draft memo leaked was mostly correct. I don't think the wallet was planted by anyone. Someone found a wallet with 700 thousand some in transactions and jumped to conclusions. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 01:30:30
Or it's just one of their working wallets and the current transaction total just happens to be in the seven hundred  thousands. This is the most simple, reasonable, and likely explanation.

Wait. I actually upvoted your first comment because I thought it was brilliant satire and everyone was missing that. You were being serious? You can't be serious...

97% of murders go unsolved. 
The killer left DNA at the scene but Belize doesn't have a national crime lab with the ability to analyze such things. 
The story I recounted above comes directly from independent accounts given by the caretaker of his compound that transfered the money and places the killer at the scene at the time of the murder and John's main girlfriend who confirmed above along with adding the part about using the other girl as bait/ to set the stage for the execution. 
The killer himself gave a rather unconvincing denial. Claimed to have been at a wedding in a different part of the country that night despite multiple indepent sources placing him on the island, and himself has since fled Belize as well. 
It's a rather cut and dry affair really.

When he lived in Orange Walk the guy he had his security staff "put a scare into" that they accidentally killed was indeed the leader of a rival gang. 
His neighbor he had executed in a peaceful expat island beach community of San Pedro was Gregory Faull,  a retired American contractor from Maimi in his 50's. He main gripe with McAfee was the attack dogs and literal gang members from Orange Walk Town McAffee brought back with him scaring the hell out of tourists and residents by you know, looming menacingly with high caliber rifles 24/7 on an otherwise normal peaceful beach...  
Not exactly a criminal mastermind. Dude literally was just pissed that people couldn't walk on the beach anymore. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:35:53
100% agree with your points. 
McAfee admits freely to shilling for hire yet this shit is upvoted to the top of the BTC sub.
Either everyone here thinks they're smarter than the markets or a lot of people take it seriously. 
Either way it doesn't look great to the general public nor does it help the long term legitimacy, and thus valuation, of BTC to so highly promote such a crass, stale, and oft used anecdote tweeted by such a dubious character. 
This is tier content. 
Though given the commonalities between the way they worshiped Skhrelli and many are adulating McAfee here I'm guessing there is more overlap there than would be... Desirable. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 14:09:48
In a western nation, yes. 
- The killer left DNA evidence at the scene. Belize has no DNA labs to test &amp; use this to solve the case. 
- the caretaker and paymaster of his island compound transferred $5,000 to the account of the bodygaurd implicated in the murder the morning before it occurred. Furthermore the caretaker was called by the bodygaurd the pick him up near the murdered man's house and bring him back to John's compound between 3 and 4 am the night of the murder. Multiple girlfriends assert the bodygaurd being present at the home in the morning and not having been there the previous evening. 
- Johns main girlfriend attested to the facts of the above independently, and added the bit about the other girl being used to distract the man/ set the stage for the assaination. 
- the bodygaurd, when confronted when the above, was curious who had said such thing, smirked and gave a very unconvincing denial. He has since fled the country after claiming there had been several attempts on his life. His aliabi for the night of the murder was a wedding in a different part of the county, Despite numerous witnesses placing him at John's house the morning after the murder. 
- John fled the country never facing questioning. He bragged about this. His bragging got him caught. 
He never addressed the praticulars of the murder but instead concocted a story about the entire government of Belize wanting him dead due to his failure to bribe a key prominant national political party via donations. 
I also don't give a shit about his fetishes. 
I do care very much that at least one very credible US citizen claims that he drugged and raped her. 
It also establishes a pattern of credibility in relation to those speaking of his actions &amp; behaviour. That is a very odd &amp; specific thing for all parties asked to mention.
I don't give a fuck about what he and other consenting adults do with each other but woman after woman independently saying he had them shit in his mouth doesn't leave a lot of room to doubt the veracity of their accounts. 
It's a very unique and personally identifiable trait and therefore relevant when considering their statements and the truth about what happened in Belize. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 16:11:32
It would be emberassing for like, The Intercept maybe, to out a whistleblower in such a stupid way. 
Vice isn't really a professional newsgathering/reporting service though... Moreso vloggers in weird and dangerous locales.
Still think the most embarrassing bit is the cybersecurity expert not sending someone to pick up the journos, checking their gear, having them ship back trackable devices and giving them burner devices with physically removed/disabled GPS chips.
This is a notoriously paranoid man who was at that point a fugitive. 
If not that the fact that he let them take pictures without thinking to say at the very least "hey, let me see that thing real quick and check the settings"
Again this is a man that is considered an "authority" on security who publicly claimed he personally was able to circumvent the encryption of iOS duing the San Bernardino fiaso who either took at their word or didn't think to check the OpSec of fucking Vice Media. 
It's beyond embarrassing.

No problem, thanks for reading!
Before the showtime doc (now on netflix) I didn't take the guy seriously but found him amusing as a truely excenteic tech millionaire. 
Almost turned it off because the first few minutes started to feel like a hit-piece. It wasn't. In the least... 
Those who doubt my timeline presented are free to watch it and then check the sources from the time periods in question.
The story it tells seems the closest we're ever going to get to the truth.  
John refuted the charges levied against him in Belize as a corrupt government intent on nothing more than killing him, never addressed the actual claims. 
John refuted the document by claiming the producers were in league with a rival gang that wanted him dead. He said that showtime was free to just pay him $500 million to avoid litigation on it. To my knowledge he has yet to sue... Wonder why... 
All accounts in the doc come from people who were in his employ, given freely without coerscion or compensation. 
They directly implicate him of the following:
1. The drugging and rape of a Harvard educated American researcher working in his Orange Walk compound's lab
2. Ordering an assult on a rival gang leader that resulted in the man's death. 
3. Paying for and arranging the circumstances of the execution of his neighbor in San Pedro, who was a retired American contractor.

There is far more to the story... These weren't pets, they were trained attack animals and a component of his security countermeasures. 
The neighbor and others had filed numerous complaints with local police and government regarding them. They were a public nusiance. It was a case of 1 asshole who thought he was above the law vs a peaceful beachfront community.
No action was ever taken by police or local government as John had donated thousands in equipment and donations to the local police. They turned a bind eye to his actions. 
There wasn't much recourse left for the neighbor or larger community, not justifying it, but it's not like John ran next door in killed the guy in an act of passionate revenge. 
He waited till the next day, paid 5k to one of his shooters, and enlisted one of his girls to lure the man into a trap. He paid for a hit and premeditated the trap to allow for the execution.  
There is a huge difference there.
@_date: 2018-04-08 12:38:58
Well... To be fair. 
1. *He* didn't murder his neighbor. He paid one of his bodygaurds in Belize $5,000 to murder his neighbor, who was distracted and door left unlocked by another one of John's girlfriends who left the bar with the man. 
He wanted the neighbor dead for posioning his dogs, who were vicious and prevented the public from traversing the beach on John's property. 
The neighbor was fond of walking to the bar like a few hundered meters from his &amp; John's homes down the beach. 
2. The girls weren't underage (in Belieze, at his 'heart of darkness' property), but were prostituting themselves.
All indicated John had no interest in traditional sex and had a hammock with a hole cut in it and was really into poop stuff. You can fill in the blanks...
3. The GRU that raided his compound didn't find any drugs. 
They found what they believed to be an amphetimine but it did not test as such.
Just months prior the lab on his property was being used for legitimate research. 
We know this because he drugged and raped the researcher who partnered with him when she quit. **Edit for further accuracy** - it didn't test as anything that could be *prosecuted as a drug in Belize*. It very well could have been an ananlouge or RC. There was DNA evidence left at the scene of his neighbor's murder. There isn't a single DNA lab in Belize, and they only recently had their first conviction partially reliant on fingerprint evidence. The bodygaurd implicated in the murder by both John's former caretaker &amp; bottom bitch has since also fled the country after attempts on his life. 
3. He fled the country (Belieze) before he could be questioned about the murder. 
EXIF data (lol) from photos that accompanied an article done by Vice led to his arrest in Guatemala for sneaking across the border.
Per his admission he faked a heart attack to avoid the narrow window Belieze had to demand his extridition before it could be blocked by petition. 
He was then summarily tossed on a plane back to the US as Guatamala didn't want the headache of jailing him. 
So yeah, total piece of shit, but at least be accurate as to why. 
**Edit 1: additional context**
It's scary to see how many people here defend the man. 
Cryptocurrencies are a great combo of the man's dual lifelong interests of making a quick buck off the technically ignorant &amp; starting a cult. 
Don't forget before he went all Colonel Kurtz in Belize he spent a decade or so as a Yogi leading 'free' retreats at his former compound in Colorado... Where the locals claimed he was more or less trying to start a cult. 
..and that before he was bought out his anti virus company was by all accounts a cult of personality that revolved around pleasing John &amp; had an internal culture akin to that of like... Atari in the 70's. 
But yeah take the man's advice on stuff. He's clearly a straight shooter. No BS. Nope, not at all.  
**Edit 2: TL:DR timeline of John**
- McAfee Security, cult like sexually charged corporate atmosphere. Took buyout when he was deemed to be unfit to be part of expanding the company &amp; going public.
- Built massive yoga retreat in Colorado, locals claimed he was starting cult. Numerous failed social network startups  during this period. Wrote 5 books on meditation and acted as Yogi. Got bored, closed down and auctioned off after he lost (or perhaps not, depending on when asked) 90% of his worth 2008-2010.  
- moves to expat island Paradise in Belize, builds beach compound. Gets bored. Partners with researcher. 
- buys large tract of land in inner Belize. Notes that he is only white Westerner in an area that is like 13% of country. Insanely high murder rate where 97% of cases are unsolved. Builds compound with lab. Cultivates harem of local women and a security force of the worst local toughs by purchasing loyality in an area of the world where poverty is endemic and life is cheap. Buys loyality and blind eye of local police. Security murders at least one other gang leader at his behest as John fears the man intends to attack him. Fleas that compound after being raided by national Gang Retaliation Unit, who is feared and seen as uncorruptable. 
- returns with entorage to peaceful expat island paradise compound. Entorage and bizzare paranoia prove unpopular here. Culminates in posioning of dogs and murder of also expat neighbor. 
- flees country like coward, concocts bizzare paranoid story of persecution. Using $, purchased influance, and a faked heart attack to get tossed back to US. 
- moves to middle of nowhere, again seems concerned with buying the blind eye of local sherrifs. Gets DUI while carrying several guns. 
- runs as libertarian cantidate. Loses to Johnson, begins to rehab image by commenting in the press on security issues, which inexplicably the press still affords him credibility on. 
- parlays this rehabed image into shilling crypto. Some of you guys take this fucking nut seriously. The cycle continues.
