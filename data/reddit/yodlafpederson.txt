HODL is easy to say but much harder to act upon. For those who have limited experience short term trading, the fear of loss is significantly greater than the euphoria on the way up.

Greedy and it won't end well. Each time the price bounces back after a correction only rewards more reckless, greed driven behavior. 
It's so easy to type HODL now because it works, but it won't always. 
Although some did well investing in BTC, they are a small minority, there is a reason the rest of us go to work everyday, I'm afraid many will learn this lesson the hard way.

I think it's good to listen to the other side of the coin (no pun intended). If and when a major price correction happens, how many will be willing to wait out a bear market period before moving on to something else?

The reason we hear of so few millionaires is because it's quite rare. Those who become millionaires from small investments had extreme cases of luck, risk taking, and courage. 
The massive moves we are seeing now only happened recently, I'm quite sure I would have been happy cashing out if I doubled my investment much earlier on.
Whether BTC crashes or not, there is massive amounts of money *surrounding* the concept, so even if you missed the boat remember that plenty in the gold rush got rich selling shovels or setting up banks (it's how Wells Fargo was started).

It's quite easy not to do it. Just wait for the first time the price doesn't come back after a correction and read the horror stories here. Guaranteed &gt; 90% will panic and get out at the worse possible time.
This instrument is extremely volatile and requires a specific plan of action. Nothing will go up forever so if you don't have a specific plan for exiting, you'll lose your money, too.
