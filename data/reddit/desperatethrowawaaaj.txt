Yes, I am willing to stay in "Little" debt, about 500$, that can be explained by a stupid drinking binge but not the whole 5000 :(

I didnt see your post as harsh, even if it were I deserve it, I know..
Under normal circumstances it would of course be best to come Clean and admit the debt but not in this case, THAT understanding wife does not exist.

It really is all or nothing at this stage for me, otherwise I wouldn't have done it. 
The debt itself is not that big, we have much more debt for our house, cars, credit cards but it is the origin of this 5000 dollar that is going to destroy everything. I will probably be sleeping in the car or at work if this doesn't go well.

You are correct, the debt is for now the problem, but how I got into it is what is the real problem here. It has everything to do with marriage and I will never again do the same misstake.
Marriage counselling is definately on the table if I make it through this.

I really hope the futures will drive up the value of bitcoin.

No way, I won't even borrow money from a friend that I know for sure would lend it to me if I asked.
I put myself into this position and I will try to solve it myself. Just venting here.

Trust me, she is not going to take this debt easily...

I did some very stupid things that got me in debt fast in a short time, it has nothing to do with gambling and I have never had a gambling problem. I don't want to go into detail about this debt but our marriage is rocky enough and I know for sure that this debt would make it 10x worse if it would survive at all. Lets just say that I make some misstakes financially AND marriage wise..
I could borrow the 5 grand from a good friend but we are already behind on our payments as it is so there is no way I can return the money to my friend (that I haven't asked) for atleast 2 years so I don't wan't to missuse friendship that way.
The Money is on its way to Kraken now, I hope I will have time to buy BTC today.
I really hope it continues to go up, If I had done this in the beginning of the week while I was still considering it I could have been free today from that f...? 5000 debt and didn't have to worry about this. 
Now I will do this gamble and probably drink the whole weekend to try to calm my nerves :(
I can't belive that I am this stupid and if I survive this I will never ever go into any kind of debt again for me personally.

I am making a gamble that might save my marriage. If I would be alone without children it wouldn't matter.

I am in Europe and usually my money is on Kraken account the day after. I have however never transfered more than about 500$ at one time.

Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-08 08:54:52
I will pray for you that you and your wife will succed!

Sorry can't do that, but I can say that it involves the worst kind of breaking trust in marriage possible that few people can forgive. 
If everything goes to hell I can come back after Christmas and tell the whole story. It isn't pretty, belive me.
@_date: 2017-12-08 09:15:23
I don't have any other options, that is even worse than this stupid idea :(

Correct, I am in Europe and not a native English speaker, but I wrote my currency amount to dollar since it is the de facto standard fiat currency wich Bitcoin translates to and to have people understand.
5000$ is about two months net pay for me, to put it in perspective.
