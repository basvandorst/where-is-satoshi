Possession of keys establishes ownership.
Not your keys, not your coins. Lose your keys, lose your coins. Get the keys, get the coin.
No authority enforces ownership. That's the point of Bitcoin.
You can build agreements on top of it for custodial purposes which shall be enforced in a different way but that is no longer within the jurisdiction of Bitcoin.

Thank god for lightning lol

Why do I need it with me all the time if I'm supposed to be just using it to store value? Or is that not the intended purpose?
@_date: 2019-04-29 06:11:09
Why? Those platforms allow me to use fiat across borders and online. What is Bitcoin meant to do then?

Gold seems to do it better at that though?

Unlike my money, I don't have a choice to physically take off my dick off me. I suggest a better metaphor if you can think of one.

It seems that anything that is traded with speculation can be a bubble to some extent.

If you dig further, you'll find that a lot of people here no longer view BTC as a currency to be used for transfer of value. I find that sad. There are those that moved on who still see the value proposition that Bitcoin supposedly has but it has been marred with controversy and talking about it on a positive note is generally frowned upon.

Will it be correct to expect that fees will increase again if this goes on?

So what's the point of Bitcoin and Lightning if the old system is better?

Why is it priced in USD in the title?

If this is the direction Bitcoin is taking with Lightning, then I think we got scammed with what it has initially been proposing since it is no longer that. And they say BCH is a scam lol.

Bitcoin looks like a Ponzi scheme because most don't understand its value proposition.
A lot of people here have huge investments without knowing what that is: Enabling transfer (and secondarily, storage) of value without the need for a middle man. Recent developments in the community have distracted even the old timers from this.

How much energy do banks consume? ATMs? Mastercard? Visa? Fiat printing?

What market traded asset isn't a bubble though?
@_date: 2019-01-27 08:16:47


Ummm, mods. This guy right here.

Isn't that the same trust level as the current financial system? So I'd rather just use my credit card then.
