At [FreeCodeCamp]( people around the globe learn web development for free (no paid versions) from scratch and in 6-12 months many of them land first developer jobs.
* More than 8,000 campers have gotten their first developer jobs.
* More than 10,000 experienced developers have gotten even better developer jobs.
* FreeCodeCamp is 100% free and doesn't charge **anything** for certifications.
I did learn web development at FreeCodeCamp myself, so I can confirm that it's a great learning platform and community.
In 2016, while I was studying there, we run a [survey]( to find out that people all around the world use FreeCodeCamp to learn coding.
One of the main benefits is that at the end of the course, as a final exam, campers develop **real websites for non-profit organizations** around the globe for free. So if you donate to FreeCodeCamp, you will also support many non-profit organizations.
Campers also develop many open-source projects like
- [mail-for-good](
- [pantry-for-good](
- [league-for-good](
- [conference-for good](
FreeCodeCamp is run by an incredible person [Quincy Larson]( a [father]( a [writer]( an activist for [NetNeutrality]( and just a very good man.
Please consider this organization for your charity mission. And thanks for uniting a community for good!

That's a good point. Smaller donations over time can have better results.
But he might be afraid to own so much money by himself, because they can be seized by hackers or kidnappers.

$85 million is not enough for that, you know that

If there is no drama, then can you explain, why such a big article with many LN flaws was heavily downvoted, but I haven't seen any technical discussion about it?

* LN is the main scaling solution proposed by BTC community for the next few years
* I've spent 2 months researching LN, talking with devs, and writing an article
* The article has 8,000\+ words, but "BCH" is mentioned only 3 times in the intro.
And you are telling that there is no "drama", even though you stopped reading intro right after first mention of BCH, and then you start criticizing big blocks scaling solution, even though I didn't advocate for it in the article. Hmm, it seems like "BCH" triggers you more, than "bcash" triggers Roger Ver, which means that there is a drama, or you just trolling me.
As for big blocks VS small blocks, I do think that mature community will embrace both software \(offchain\) and hardware \(onchain\) scaling solutions, instead of dividing into two separate coins, and constantly attacking each other.

* Bully nodes can shut down small forwarding nodes
* Message to LN critics and fans
* Small experiment
* More to come
1. LN has a great potential as a second layer solution, which relies solely on software evolution in opposite to hardware evolution \(big blocks\).
2. Current LN state has poor UX for average users, but it’s developing rapidly.
3. LN needs lots of time to mature, until it can be adopted globally.
4. 2018: it’s very unlikely that LN will save BTC from network congestions and high fees, if crypto mania will come back later this year.
5. With a current protocol, LN has many incentives to become a heavily centralized ‘hub and spoke’ system, which has strong downsides \(more about that in the next articles\).
@_date: 2018-05-22 22:18:23
That's quite biased attitude, giving an importance of the topic, isn't it?
@_date: 2018-05-23 19:51:24


Submarine Swaps and Splicing can help with that.
As for other concerns, yes, I agree, that with a current protocol LN will tend to be centralized, which means less anonymity and may be some degree of censorship \(if it won't be possible for an average Joe to 'route around' big hubs\). I'd like to talk about these issues in more details in the next articles.
@_date: 2018-05-23 12:41:44
Thanks for good words. I also support LN as a second layer solution, which can be later used on many other altcoins. However, there is a lot of development to be done, before LN can be used on a global scale, which many LN\-fans don't understand.


Exactly, totally agree with you. Unfortunately, this subreddit is very hostile to any kind of criticism, even though this criticism could help to drag more attention to certain weak points of a LN protocol, and eventually improve a whole project.
Embracing critics and white hackers is a good way to improve your project, and companies usually pay good money for that. I've made a big research and released a pretty candid review of current LN state for free, but this post got heavily downvoted, so it seems like Bitcoin community chooses not to pay any attention to flaws in the system and shut all critics up. Sad...
@_date: 2018-05-23 17:52:49


No, I've said that LN "can be later used on many other altcoins", meaning that it's not attached to BTC and thus should be judged as a separate tech, without unnecessary emotions, which rise from ongoing 'small VS big blocks' confrontation. And LN is already used on LTC.
I'm not interested in ad hominem conversation, but please feel free to write about specific issues with an article. I might edit a few sections, if you will convince me that they are wrong.


P.S. I don't have a favorite coin, so I usually use the most convenient coin ATM, which used to be BTC, but after network congestions I've switched to other altcoins.

Thanks, nice read, there are some very good points:




That's probably one of the reasons while banks won't disappear even in crypto-based society, because people will use them as safe boxes and pay fees for that.

* Central banks are incentivized to push a narrative that inflation is necessary.
* Deflation periods in modern history were not caused by a restriction in the money supply, but a collapse in demand.
* In a deflationary monetary system people will anticipate deflation and thus adjust to expectations of future lower prices.
* Any rapid change in the economy is dangerous, so the shift to a deflationary economy should be gradual.
* Hoarding is not inherently bad because it’s a form of lending to the society.
* Banks accelerate demand-pull inflation by over-lending to consumers.
* A deflationary monetary system per se will not lead to a significant decrease in aggregate demand.
* Inflation can occur even with a fixed money supply.
* Decrease in economic growth might reduce environmental pollution.
* Deflationary spiral is very unlikely because of UBI, demand for basic needs and anticipation of deflation.
* Inflation and deflation are zero-sum games.
* Deflation is not inherently bad in a healthy economy.

**Solutions to privacy issue:**
\- Fuzz transaction time via random delay
\- Rotate watchtowers after each transaction
\- Bundle together many updates from different users
\- Route updates via hopes
\- Create lots of network noise via penny-transactions
**Solutions to scalabilty issue:**
\- Watchtowers can keep only the latest state updates (LN’s eltoo, RDN)
\- A user doesn't need to send states updates that allocate all or most funds to himself
\- Watchtowers can delete state updates after some time, e.g. 1 year
\- Users can send requests to delete old state updates of already closed channels
\- Technological progress can decrease operating costs
**Hybrid models:**
\- A few hybrid models (you can read in more details in the article) combine different methods together in order to achieve better results, but they all have drawbacks.
\- There are different approaches to solve privacy and scalability issues, but all of them have certain trade-offs, so the future of watchtowers is still very unclear, and it’s important to discuss pros and cons of different designs, as well as their incentives models.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:02:46


Not clear what do you mean. If you mean that a user should use a watchtower controlled by himself, then it's not a scalable solution, because most laymen won't be able to run a full node and monitor blockchain 24/7.
@_date: 2019-02-07 17:31:44


Sure, there might different implementations, but watchtowers still have to monitor all new blocks pretty much 24/7 (depends on the settlement time, which can vary a lot), so I doubt that laymen will run their own watchtowers.


Agree, I'm mostly referring to resource needs in the article, when talk about scalability. Laymen won't run their own watchtowers, because its inconvenient, so your original solution doesn't sound realistic to me. As for watchtowers, they can try to reduce their operating and capital costs (resource needs) with different techniques, but most of them imply low privacy. You can read about it in more details in both articles if you're really interested in this topic.
@_date: 2019-02-07 16:36:44


In case of watchtowers it's usually the opposite as was described in [the first article]( Most scalability issues imply low privacy, e.g., linking together state updates made by the same account/channel in order to delete old state updates and store only the latest one, which is great for scalability, but terrible for privacy.

Thanks, I'm trying to write candid articles without hidden agendas, and this time the post got 90% upvotes, which is already a good sign, because last article was heavily downvoted. Now the community is more open to a discussion, so I appreciate that.
We share the same optimism about off-chain scaling solutions, because I believe that eventually developers will overcome all the issues, but it will take many years, and, as you said, we have to discuss the incentive model of the system before developing it.
I hope that article will get more exposure, because then I'd be able to continue the research and cover different solutions to watchtower's and monitoring service's problems, as well as their trade-offs.
BTW, what do you think about eltoo? I'm afraid that it will incentivize watchtowers to follow RDN's approach, but it would be nice to see two different models with very different approaches (LN &amp; RDN).

* Similar to crypto community, HK pro-democracy movement is evolving in extremely hostile environment, so decentralization is essential for surviving.
* Netizens across the world participate in HK pro-democracy movement.
* There are different platforms for discussions and collective decision making process: LIHKG (Cantonese/Traditional Chinese), Pincong (Mandarin/Simplified Chinese), Reddit (English).
* There is a [GitHub page]( where people can create issues and submit pull requests.
* Anybody can submit a proposal for an event, suggest some tactics, start a crowdfunding campaign, and share tips from their fields of expertise.
* Most protests in 20th century achieved significant changes after they have gained the active participation of just 3.5% of the population, but in HK it’s not the case, because HK government is controlled by Beijing.
* Even though CIA (NED) is meddling, the pro-democracy movement in HK has a huge public support and it’s very different from US-backed regime-change attempts in other countries like Venezuela.
* Many on-the-ground tactics have been already adopted by activists from numerous previous protests.
* In order to bring more international attention activists place ads in newspapers across the world, visit foreign consulates, wave foreign flags, organize airport sit-ins and rallies in other countries, and visit famous tourist destinations across the world with a flag “Liberate Hong Kong”.
* In order to raise awareness among mainland Chinese, HK activists organize events in locations with high tourist density, distribute booklets, create countless Lennon Walls, and share posters via AirDrop.
* Many people in crypto community support HK pro-democracy fight and closely follow all the events.
