yeah, but they can sell a coin or two for all their monthly expenditures.

In 2 years I guess. Jan 1st 2014 - Dec 31st 2015.
But I believe he was just looking at things differently. Once you list all of your assets, you will notice how much you really have.

Whatever floats your boat...
You really spend that much effort to "show them"..?

I'm just waiting for my btc to rise to the moon.
Actually a T-Modell Mercedes would do just fine.

Yeah, but to me, these two are somewhat alright, and truly believe in btc.
They hold the coin somewhat solid.
If they would sell, now that would be an earthquake.

The big crash will probably happen after GB left the EU and the remaining nations rely on Germany. It is a fragile situation.
The biggest jump in all coins was around Jan/Feb right when Trump got inaugurated.
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:27:36
It just reached 10,000€!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 20:39:38
A big correction incoming!!!
@_date: 2017-12-03 21:10:23
2018 is the year of Blockchain. BTC just reached the 10,000€, Ether just kicked down the 400€ door, and LTC 90€
Expecting 12,000€ BTC, 500€ Ether and 100€ LTC on New Years Eve.

Sell all your bitcoins and buy bitcoin trash, they are the most valuable ones!!1!
@_date: 2017-12-14 16:10:32
Wouldnt that make the other coins more valuable?
If there are 21,000,000 and 20,000,000 are gone forever. How would we know? How would it affect us? Wouldn't the coind "die out" after 2-3 generations?

Of course IF....

Well, at least I got that going for me, which is nice....

I wouldn't carelessly spend that money on “booze and birds“, as George Best would call it.

Looking at how much I made this month in BTC, and in "real life", it kind of replaced my job...
@_date: 2017-12-16 15:16:16
On Jan 1st 2017 - ~1031BTC = 1mio$
On Jul 1st 2017 - ~402 BTC = 1mio$
On Nov 1st 2017 - ~157 BTC = 1mio$
Today (~50 days later) ~ 53 BTC = 1mio$
I am totally fine, if today next year if 20-25 BTC = 1mio$...

Multiplied by the numbers of Satoshis.
@_date: 2017-12-14 14:39:57
We are going sideways for quite some time now, I expect it to go to 20,000 until the beginning of next year. But not a 80 percent increase that we had in november.
I try to find a corelation between the btc price and the users currently online..
@_date: 2017-12-03 17:38:23
Indeed it did. But of course all the business news channels and newspaper will print those 5 digits, once it hits the 10,000 in our currency. Even better, just days after the $10,000.
It is at 9,900 now..

Investing in a Casino?
@_date: 2017-12-03 15:36:30
Sell at high, buy at low.
If I would have sold 4 days ago and bought back in a day later, I would have had a 20 percent increase. For a whole BTC holder, that would be a difference of 2,000$.
@_date: 2018-05-04 12:54:34
It was about that time, when the guy in California (?) sold his house to buy a shitload of coins.

@_date: 2017-08-15 18:40:05
That was the plan ;)
@_date: 2017-08-15 15:42:55
Welp, i bought at 4,300$....
@_date: 2018-06-21 15:53:48
It's kind of funny how cynical the people here got compared to 7-8 months ago.
I believe the coin will rise back to maybe 10,000 by the end of the year and maybe 15,000 next year. Just because the new generation (GenZ?) all heard of bitcoin and it will be more common to trade your Dollar to btc or pay via btc when you're in another country.
Supply and demand, the supply of new coins rises slower than the demand.

@_date: 2017-11-02 10:53:59
I expected the same, but honestly why should I care.
BTC 1 month -&gt; 50 percent 
LTC 1 month -&gt; ~3 percent

If I had the cash and would be called an idiot by some random guy afterwards, I'd gladly be that guy.

Good for you, but wouldn't “hold for life“.
If it is worth a million, I would buy a nice house or something. So hopefully next year ;-)
@_date: 2017-11-02 15:12:38
I said it is gambling to me!
You could also bet on currencies like Soros did in the 90s.
I truly believe that it, as a currency, will play a relevant role in this century.
@_date: 2017-11-04 06:26:48
Or a house, you would hold 191.118 bitcoin now.
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:07:15
It is hard to believe, that one year ago you were a btc millionaire when you had about 1300 btc in your wallet. Now yor are one with about 110 in your wallet.

@_date: 2017-11-29 20:32:41
Grab the profits.
There are guys who also try to manipulate like 3 weeks ago. They traded satoshis and blocked the traffic crashing the sales price.
@_date: 2017-11-02 10:52:51
I sold my BTC about one month ago at 4000€, expecting a dip.
I placed my money in ETH and LTC, Ether was just a fucking loss.... LTC made about 3 percent in that month (reaching all time high and now back to where its been a month ago)
I returned back to BTC about 30 hours ago and made already more than 10 percent.
If I would have hodl my BTC last month, I would have made more than 50 percent......

Thank you Mr. EatAssOnSecondDate!
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:15:39
Of course I would? I don't understand that question..
BTC to me is gambling as well... I EXPECT the BTC to rise to 10,000$. It is just a pure speculation.
The only difference here is I wouldnt bet my fucking house on it. But if I'd knew, or be that extremely desperate, why not...
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:42:38
Even though he missed out on 700,000 $ and more... he was a smart man to do so.

@_date: 2017-10-12 11:06:48
It seems, you were right, though the Litecoin rises just as well, I think I will place a good amount in my BTC in the next bigger dip. Still hoping for 4,000$. ;)
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:13:31
I know, and I could kick my ass that I didnt invest mor money in BTC than..
I'm expecting the BTC to go down by 10percent and the LTC to rise atleast 5 percent
@_date: 2017-10-09 19:44:02
Welp, I sold at 4000€ and placed all my BTC money in Litecoins. Speculating on volatility. Also waiting for the next BTC dip.
@_date: 2018-04-22 09:02:08
