U know dooglus name , address phone number? :D . 
prcdice  ??? They open site that took like 5 days to build judging by thiers design , and start accepting others people money to make bank and they are trusted ??? 
dicebitoin ???  Did u read what dooglus proposed to them, and they did not accept. Ofc they didn't. They love to have option to run away with money whenever they want , same as everydice did, why in hell would they accept dooglus offer and not be able to do that :D . 
Only reason why i made this post here today is coz of that guy scottt rained so much and i wanted to share so people can come and get some of that . 
And to try out reddit, coz i never used it before, and i already don't like it. 
On forums people atleast have some back story when they post something, seems that u are posting something and u don't have slight idea what are u talking about .

Lol , i just posted link to this, did not ask for any up down vote. I down voted u thou. 
And im not here to compete with up or down votes, idk what that even means atm :D . 
And yeah u sound that u know what u talking about . 
Primedice will run with investments :D . 
I don't even see whats the point in this argument , i did not ask anybody to come and gamble, i did not even post my ref link :D .
Just said that IMO its great site , with great community, faucet , tips all ower the chat, i tipped 0.3+ btc alone.

LOL again :D . 
Stunna is so unknown :D . 
And pls first learn about something and then talk about it. 
Primedice never has and never will take investments.
Its been on 2nd place in dice games for years , and now that jd is gone its absolute no1 .
