not sure how you can cal this considering all the bitcoins will be in wallets. So for most wallets (specially physical ones), we reach a schrodinger's cat scenario where we either consider the wallet to be with the owner or misplaced. As of now, you can write off 7500 from the 21 mil tho :D

They range from $17 dollars to $150. And i charge 4% commission to guarantee that the bitcoins cannot be traced back to you. It can be traced back to me through the blockchain but not to you, the final consumer. Thats the beauty of Bitcoin that people don't use.

You can get pre encrypted bitcoin sticks too. Should be around 117 USD but the best form of protection. I use that for my high end clients when i take them off the blockchain ledger

Bitcoin sticks. Eg-

Maybe this has been posted by the AI itself. OP is only a month old on reddit

Point taken. My potential clients are people who i feel maybe have heard of bitcoin (mostly bad) here and there but have no real idea about how it works and the good aspects about it. My selling process also includes education about my product. The easy part is that the product is building itself. I just need to talk about it 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:31:38
I would like to understand how to store the bitcoins into a USB or bitcoin stick so it cant be traced. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:35:35
Really Helpful, once last question.  If i wish to locally transfer the keys from one hardware wallet to another at a later stage, will that show up on the ledger ?
Thanks again
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:51:00
Apologies. But i got the answer. Bitcoin sticks are exactly as you assumed them. Heres a link to some

True. To be more specific, tech companies would be those with their core products/service related to the tech industry. They could use tech for distribution or channels but they dont sell any kind of tech.
@_date: 2017-01-09 10:22:47
Thanks buddy. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 12:00:07
Thanks buddy. all cleared up.

ive been to more places than you've used condoms to fuck your sister. Just get your hillbilly ass back to Texas if you have such a problem living here dude. 
@_date: 2017-01-05 12:32:40
Have you used any of the marketplaces you have listed above? if so, could you tell me the bare min info they captured from you?
@_date: 2017-01-17 08:29:30
so you do have inbred kids. so how does it work in the US? do you get paid for raising disabled children. How much did you mom earn by saving that money instead?
@_date: 2017-01-18 10:24:19
haha. I would kinda tell them about it first you know. i wish i was a good enough salesman to sell products without explaining the product first 
@_date: 2017-01-11 11:15:12
While in this transactions, im giving it to my parents to trust is a pre existing factor (i hope :D). But could you elaborate more on the difference between storing bitcoins on a thumb drive and hardware wallets?
@_date: 2017-01-18 10:25:08
Good idea. Maybe this way i can stumble upon already happening events like these. Thanks !
@_date: 2017-01-12 04:08:15
Natural for a Texan to base their view on 3  personal experiences. There is no law against usage of Bitcoin in India FYI :)
@_date: 2017-01-17 07:24:00
Job loss= need for basic income= digital currency= need for security= blockchain. 
Bitcoin as an idea will be used. Think of Bitcoin as the world's foremost functional prototype
@_date: 2017-01-25 09:24:28
I need that right now, Willing to pay as well. Just need like 30-45 mins over Skype. Ive lurked on this sub a lot and have some basic understanding. I just need some questions answered. I can also get you potential clients from my network who are interested in the same. 
@_date: 2017-01-11 10:49:47
Thanks. Apologies if the question wasnt clear enough but what i just wanted to know was if the handing over gets accumulated or not. Im a noob to bitcoin but the way i see it, a good amount of the bitcoin transactions in the future will happen over bitsticks.
@_date: 2016-12-28 09:59:39
Im in India. Checked out all these players you guys bought up but they aren't here. So option two, how do i store bitcoins on a USB stick?
@_date: 2017-01-17 06:35:44
Which inbred child of yours took 13 years to type in this comeback? the one who dodged the rusted coat hangar or the one who survived the pill? 
Just get your baby wipes and go back to your mom's basement dipshit
@_date: 2017-10-23 19:39:14
whats a google?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:40:27
Please take a few moments of your time to enlighten me further sensei. What do you mean by this ?
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:36:15
Exactly the opportunity cost. I can't even run an NPV without actual stats. But Ill keep an eye on this and post updates. Thanks again
@_date: 2017-06-21 12:39:20
Youre right. is pre mined AF making its no different than a bank. Thanks 
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:42:31
How? And also how can i spot crypto scams in the future?
@_date: 2017-06-20 12:47:22
OP if you need this post translated in Hindi, look no further. Also you can try posting on r/india. Just tweak your post a lill bit and say those guys killed cows in india. You dont even need the bounty. (btw im Indian so this is not racist). (PSA- not kidding bout the cows, that shit is serious over here)

Willing to trade bitcion for gf OP

Is there a bit coin wallet with an in built display that shows the number of coins in it?
