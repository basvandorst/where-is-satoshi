"You should also read the SEC form 1662 enclosed in this letter which I have included with this letter and subpoena."

Many people who have worked in the non-profit industry (in my limited experience) leave with the POV that charity is disempowering to the people it's trying to help. So in that sense, you're not the only one. 
OTOH, it's not about enabling people who have 'stopped trying.' The reasons that people may end up homeless/addicted are myriad, and there is almost always some aspect of mental illness involved, amongst many other complexities. It's insultingly dismissive of you to frame homelessness as a situation where people have 'stopped trying.' 
I do agree that giving food and shelter is not an effective way to eradicate homelessness. What it is, is a way to ameliorate the daily lives of people who have it far tougher than any of us tapping away on our keyboards on a bitcoin subreddit.

I know? You were asking for "information to shove down their throat"; I was suggesting the fact that Overstock and Dell accept BTC as a point that might speak to her, help legitimize BTC in her mind. 
I'm under the impression that you will have 10-15 minutes with the teacher and principal, and therefore won't be whipping out the white paper and reading excerpts. Seems to me that simple points indicating that Bitcoin is not a Ponzi would be most effective, hence the suggestion of mentioning major retailer who have 'bought in'. You're free to ignore my suggestion.

Homeless people are not going to do that. The thought is sweet, but completely unrealistic. In my opinion. 
That said, I'm hiking tomorrow with a friend who works with the homeless population in Vancouver (highest homeless pop. in Canada by far); she's on the ground and knows a lot of homeless women quite well, I'll ask what she thinks. I think she'll laugh at me, but maybe I'll be surprised. I'll report back.

You should explain:

Because it walks your buyers through the process with a pretty GUI, and allows you to accept an amount as small as $0.25 easily/without fees (I think). 
It also automates things from your end; you *could* just post your BTC address and have people email their transaction number to you once it's completed, and then email them a link to the download, but that's a huge pain in the ass for you and them. 
@_date: 2014-12-25 16:06:32
Addresses starting with '3' are [multisig addresses.](
[Multibit may not yet support sending to multisig addresses.](

No, not one that would be super-confusing. However, I do think that sticking to 2 terms (bitcoin and satoshi) would be much simpler than 3+ (bitcoin, satoshi, bit, [metric prefix]bit), and I also think that simpler is better and we should be aiming for that.

I agree with your stance on 501c3 in theory, but in practice if everyone took your stance, fraud would be (even more) rampant in the non-profit sector. It's not fair to your donors to turn your back on the system of accountability that exists without providing a new one. 
'Social proof' is nice, but only a small part of the accountability puzzle- it only shows that you've done *something*, and that people like you as a person. It doesn't show what percentage of donations go where, doesn't give your donors any clear idea of where their money is going. When you run a non-profit, you have accountability not only to the people you provide services for, but to the people who allow you to provide those services. It's your job to provide the means of accountability- if not via the government, then some other way. 
If you're not going to file 501c3 (and I DO get that stance, and respect it), do your donors the service of keeping your books impeccably, and make it public.

Japan has a deflationary economy, and their housing market is pretty different. Hodling is wiser economically than investing in real estate, so you get this [disposable home culture](
This might become a more standard practice elsewhere, though I think that the shift will happen slowly enough that it won't be a crash. I also think it may evolve gradually into something that isn't as resource-intensive; we might even end up being more environmentally-friendly. If you knew it was only for 5 years or 10 years, wouldn't you be more likely to buy/build a cobb home or a straw bale home, or live in a yurt?

The BTM at Steamrollers on Robson doesn't require any ID/verification. 
@_date: 2014-11-07 21:32:52
Confirmed. 
So, my friend (who works with the [PHS]( and at [Insite]( said very few of the homeless people she knows have phones, and even if they do get them, they're almost definitely going to either sell them or have them stolen. She also said very few are more than basic-level computer literate, even the younger ones. 
She felt pretty strongly that the type of people who would be able to pull together the ability to receive 'change' in bitcoin are already good at making money (and then went off for a while about how homelessness is almost entirely about marginalization, mental illness and addiction, and that poverty is a byproduct.)
So, that's one person's perspective. I feel a bit bad about pooh-poohing your idea which is clearly kindhearted, but I also feel really really strongly that this perspective is needed. A LOT of well-meaning money and energy in the world gets misdirected in ways that are not actually practical or useful to the populations they're trying to help.

I really want to start coming to the Van meetups- I have no bitcoin friends. How many people are usually there? 
@_date: 2014-10-22 00:22:52
I agree with all of this.
This has to happen at some point, and there will never be a better time. 
100 satoshis = 1 bitcoin will be an easy mental switch for most people, as it mimics the way many or most fiat currencies are denominated. It'll make more sense to new adopters. 
But it won't happen if this subreddit alone just starts redefining those terms. There has to be some decision, consensus and announcement. How do we help move that along?

My friend has a company that has just started accepting bitcoin- he's excited to get involved in bitcoinworld, and will be holding any BTC he makes. 
He sells universal water filters- replacement filters that are fully compatible with Brita/Culligan water pitchers, but are all-natural and compostable. They filter with the same types of materials as Brita, but Brita uses a plastic resin in their filter (as a water softener), whereas the flowpure filters my friend's company manufactures use natural ingredients, including activated charcoal made from coconut shells, and a naturally-sourced mineral as a water softener. 
His Bitcoin Black Friday deal is $5 off 1 carton of filters (3 filters per carton, lasting 2 months each), or $8 off 2+ cartons. The discount of $5 or $8 off will be applied automatically during Coinbase checkout (you'll see the discounted price reflected on the second page of checkout). 
These filters are legit awesome- they're cheaper *and* better than Brita replacement filters. If you already use a filter pitcher, you should consider trying these ones as your next replacements. :)

@_date: 2014-11-07 08:25:01
I love this idea- backpackers and hostels absolutely have a ton to gain from bitcoin, and i agree that it will catch on easily in that scene. 
I'd suggest starting with talking to hostel managers/owners, helping them learn to accept bitcoin payment and perhaps broker exchange of bitcoin to local fiat. As you're doing that, you'll get hit with more new ideas than you can keep up with, I'll bet.
Good luck!

You can offer swaps on Bitfinex and loan out your BTC (to margin traders) for daily interest. Currently 0.005% daily, which is very low, but when things are moving/volatile, interest rates of 0.1% daily aren't uncommon.

Yes, I've been there too, worked in international aid in W Africa for 4 years. I'm not saying people don't have access to internet cafes, but if a person is in an internet cafe and *on reddit*, they're most likely in a city/large town, they have time to do that, they have funds to pay for it, they're literate, and they know English. This person is probably doing relatively OK.
I suppose I'm just trying to point out that wealthier people in poor countries are generally the ones who benefit from well-meaning aid from the West.

It's assumed (and seen) that when bitcoin is worth more, more people will mine. More people mining means greater competition/increased difficulty, and so more resources are required (rigs, electricity) to get the same profit. The correlation between bitcoin's value rising and cost of mining rising is indirect, but pretty clear-cut. HTH.
