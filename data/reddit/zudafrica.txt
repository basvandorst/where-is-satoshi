Your paper wallet has the private and public keys. Electrum  wallet coins can be sent to your paper wallet. Coins from any other source can be sent to a paper wallet. Use segwit.  You do not need Electrum and a paper wallet to obtain cold storage. You do not have to export coins-----just send them to the paper wallet. There is only one transaction to do---when you buy a coin, the address you receive  that coin will be your paper wallet public address. One simple step. The beauty of a paper wallet is that you can check your balance of coins on any Block Explorer. ( like blockchain.info)

Buy bitcoin and wait for a suitable profit.  Or sell it when it drops 20- 40%.  Remember that Btc has risen 1150000% in 9 years. Your choice is obvious.

@_date: 2019-07-07 05:19:33
So coinbase and any other wallet are completely independent.  Binance is a wallet. Both will do what you want them to do. You must not leave your coins with them ---give no trust,. as they are exchanges. You have to find a wallet provider like Samouri or Wasabi where your coins are controlled by you alone, like a hardware wallet.
@_date: 2019-07-30 02:25:52
Too late my friend---the best option for you is to buy btc directly. Any amount will make you more successful if you Dollar Average---and prevent your gambling losses through mining.
@_date: 2019-07-09 08:10:18
Assume 9 years and initial cost of $1 per BTC with 9 purchases at the low of the year, with a sale at today's Marketcap  would give  a  ROI of  1100%

All coins on all exchanges are not yours---get  your own hardware wallet and accept responsibility.
@_date: 2019-07-07 23:36:43
Paper wallets are your coins, you are the exchange, you pay a pier from your wallet, just as if you send a coin to an exchange to be traded, all your coins are offline ., an external exchange like coinbase is not required to send someone your coins.   It will become clear to you when you print out a paper wallet and follow the instructions .

So , you buy  3000 worth now, BTC drops 60% , you loose 1800.    IF BTC goes up 60% you gain 1800. Which is more likely? Who is to say-----now you have to look at the trends my friend-----it is never too late to BUY!

Your vender trusts it but he may be the agent-----so if you are the buyer you only have to trust the seller. If you do, pay the agent, if you do not, cancel the deal. Your only validation necessary is about the seller.
@_date: 2019-07-09 16:31:05
A strong bullish sign , my hodlers.
@_date: 2019-07-04 05:05:31
Bitcoin  is a market like any other market. Boy for 250, hold for a while and sell for 350.   Or buy for 250 and sell when 150---you lose 100. Very very simple. Buy a car for 20,000 sell for 10 years later for 2000----you lose 18,000.
@_date: 2019-07-04 05:16:54
Wallet backup  function backs up all transactions---file is called "wallet.dat" .  Put on usb storage. If compter or Core crashes, your .DAT file can recover your coins  on a new computer. BUT , use a hardware wallet for long term storage.

A mesh network is close to being decentralized ----bitcoin no. But as a network, BTC is pretty good, no office, no employees, no country, no central servers, no managers, distributed protocol, distributed developers,no governance, no PR,no media spokesperson, no leader,no creator, no private deals,no stock holders, no plans, no directions. It does not care about reality which is why it is special.

Tell him he is a burner-----there is no way a copy/paste action can make a mistake, and for it to appear in the blockchain. In the same vein , when your transaction shows pending at the time of sending a payment , you can be sure it is a valid transaction and 100% sure he will receive it( in time). His wallet may not show it but the blockchain shows it. 
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:57:52
BISQ is one stop download---uses Tor automatically.
@_date: 2019-03-12 18:44:24
I do---for the next 15 years. Who knows the future of any exchange. BISQ is decentralised , the only one, like bitcoin. BUT it is small and lacks liquidity and you have to be patient. 
@_date: 2019-03-10 03:04:59
A LN channel is always funded fully ----for any amounts up to your fund max. with the option at any time to increase your fund. Then if you are a bad actor you lose you fund automatically for each bad or time out or unresolved issues.for each transaction.  LN has no arbitrators, to ensure good actors.
@_date: 2019-03-14 06:08:48

Back to basics I see. 1) Yes---all coins are on the blockchain 2) To get your coins on the BC you have to buy them with an address in your wallet. 3)your wallet is where your keys are kept to send and receive addresses. 4) your wallet protects all your addresses with a superkey ---the seed. The seed is a list of 6,12,24 words selected from a library of 2024 words.5) If you lose your wallet, backups,or computer you can recover your wallet with another public wallet such as Electrum with your seed words.  This is because your coins are still there on the Blockchain.

There are about 2040 words in the list. Each word has the same chance of being picked. So when a single word is selected for your 1st word in your 24 word list, that word has a 1 in 2040 th chance of being select in the next 23 selections. So a lot of seeds have 2 or 3 same word repeats. If you don't like a seed which has repeats there is a option to reject it and select a different list of seed words so you have 24 different words.

Your income from gambling was taxed at your marginal tax rate (about 28%)50/180. Big mistake. You traded currency commodities and realized capital gains---You pay taxes on 50% of those gains which are added to you yearly income---so you declare taxable income of 50 plus 65 =115 at 20% tax rate = 23,000 instead of 50,000. So come clean and re-do your taxes as per IRS regs and re-file  2016-2018. No matter what, get a another accountant to file for currency gains.

When you send or receive a bitcoin, within a second it is broadcast and the transaction is detected by the network. Both parties to the transaction will be notified that the transaction is "pending" or "unconfirmed"----this means the network detects a valid transaction to be "confirmed". This is the point where the "zero confirmation " has been reached and there is a 99.9% chance of it being confirmed. From this point parties wait for confirmations 1 to 6.Send the goods on 1 confirmation.

To be able to send a bitcoin anywhere, he must have bought it from somebody (say Coinbase). So coinbase and the whole world knows his identity ( Analytics). Now , that coin is in his trezor and as soon as any coin in his trezor moves, the whole world knows where that coin went to.(Analytics ), The lesson is that every coin has a history and is "tainted" and can reveal your potential identity. The IRS knows all the names of the big Hodlers.

Real traders with 10 years experience limit their trades to roughly 4 or 5 trades a year. Through analysis they let the market dictate when and how much to sell or buy. These trades are done with asset management planning no matter what the analysis says. The technique involves a staggered entry or retreat with every trade----10%, 15% 25% 50% example. In other words----traders do not trade with assets that they would hate to lose.

20 Million  each day goes to the miners. There are 60 million users---so each user losses 33 cents per day through inflation. Each investor has made more on average than 33 cents per day. So 2000 is not excessive( next year miners get 1000)

The latest DAT file is the best----The one that worked for me was one that had the same size as the latest. Be sure it is named "wallet.dat" and make sure it is in the folder with the QT file ----- and make sure it is the only wallet.dat file in that folder------you can rename or move/copy other DAT files so they do not get accessed by the QT application. All this activity must be done while the protol is shut done and not running.

The protocol does not care about the real world.

There is a financial rule of thumb to spend 2% of the worth of the asset on security per year. So for 1000 $ it works out at 20/year. If the nano cost 60, you have spent your budget for 3 years.  BUT for your piece of mind get another one for your btc only---keep the current one for sh\*t coins.

@_date: 2019-12-28 15:19:00
So another point is that banks block and disallow these types of transactions because of KYC regulations. The IRS insist on taxing gains but require tax to be paid in fiat funds----so we have a catch 22 situation. Time to opt out and privatize BTC---the path is clear for the next development action.
