It doesn't matter what the objective of bitcoin is. What matters is the ideology behind the people who have invested in bitcoin. The people who genuinely care about the technology and objective of bitcoin is a much smaller percentage than the ones who just want to make a quick buck.

The price was reasonable enough for a casual investor to take his/her chances at making a good profit back then.
The higher the price goes, the harder it is for new investors to make money, therefore the appeal diminishes. The market cap must grow exponentially to achieve 15-30k gain.

I mentioned fractions. If you spent $5k on bitcoin when it was $5k you'd own an entire bitcoin. If the price doubled, your profits doubled. 
If you spent $5k on bitcoin when the price is $15k you'd own 0.33333 of a bitcoin. The likelihood for bitcoin to double from 15-30k is far less, and your profit margins are greatly diminished to only a 33% return. To the average person, this doesn't seem worth the risk. It doesn't have the same "get rich" appeal as it did when the price was lower. Which, like it or not, is the reason we saw that large influx of new "investors".

The value it gained was from people who genuinely cared about the technology of bitcoin and wanted to see it succeed, yes.
 The hype run was from people who wanted to make a quick buck. 
The % of people who want to make a quick buck outweighs the ones who care about the technology. This cycle may repeat itself, but it will always be a means to an end.

You'll never be able to. It's too volatile. We got as *CLOSE* to mass adoption, is what I said. Some companies are accepting bitcoin to test the waters, but the fluctuation is going to deter most of them. Why would a grocery store ever accept a currency that could tank to $0 at any moment?

I've taken all my money out of crypto. I have no reason to post FUD. Every negative post about bitcoin is regarded as "FUD". Further proving the cult-like mentality of it all. Everyone is defensive because they shut out everything that gets in the way of what their delusional truth is.

Idk, that money somehow pays my bills.

I've had this account for 6 years.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:09:58
I just remembered I had it. What difference would it make? Why wouldn't I just make a new account instead of using a 6 year old one? makes no sense lol

I've been in and out of bitcoin since 2012. All other corrections were at reasonable prices. It hovered around 14-15k for a while. Which is the highest it'll ever reach stability at, imo. Average people can't afford to invest more than 5-10k. When the coin was 5-10k it was more likely that people would invest, since they would own a larger fraction....thus having the potential for higher profits.

I personally don't see why it would. Bitcoin started with good intentions, but greed and an unregulated market have destroyed it. It turned into nothing but a get rich quick scheme. The hype is over. Everyone on here wants you to believe they are into crypto for these admirable reasons, but at the end of the day it's all about money.

Love the panic posts that come in times like these. Denial and pseudo self-reassurance all the way. baby.
