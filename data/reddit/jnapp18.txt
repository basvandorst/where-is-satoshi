The way this post is titled you make it sound like they were attacking Bitcoin...
I thought it was a great video with very valid/fair/friendly questions and even better answers.

I bought 13 BCC at $180 on Bittrex... Sold at $230 :'(

Especially as someone who isn't one of these rich investors. 14-18k would have been huge for me.

I agree they need to change to BCH, but to be fair my statement was accurate given the context.

Well I understand that the silk road sees about 1.2 million in sales per month, and I can only assume that has been increasing rather quickly. I heard the BTC started at 4 cents per BTC, a lot of people must have gotten rich off it pretty quickly.

I think what he means is that if he buys at say $800, then a day later it rises to $1000, but then 3 days later (before he recieves his BTC) the price begins to fall say $700, he wants to have the chance to sell before it falls below his initial buy price.

I can vouch for the site and the owner... His name is Greg Matthews.. He also has a Facebook page, YouTube channel, twitter feed, and a website called bitcoinranger.com 
I actually told him about reddit last night and.that it might be a good place to self promote.. I can post a coingator receipt later tonight if you are interested.

I think you are looking at it a little wrong, but I see your point. Yes, 1.0 BTC is arbitrary, but isn't any unit? Why do we have 1 kilogram, gram, micro gram etc. So yes, we could look at 1 mBTC and it would have a different cap, but with 1 BTC we get more reasonable numbers to deal with (people don't want to think in quadrillions). Anyway this is just my perspective and I pulled 90% of it out of my a$$.
