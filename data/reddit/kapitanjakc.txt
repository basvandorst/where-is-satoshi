**Heart wants what the heart wants.**
It was few months back when I first joined with the bitcoin, I knew about bitcoin since it was like 100-200 USD stage. But back then I was just a student and didn't had money, I invested when it was around 1800 USD. It was always a great joy to buy the BTC. I felt a sudden surge of happiness whenever I saw my BTC balance. Then on one fateful day I found out that with trading you can make bitcoins, and to increase my bitcoin balance I started trading. And in no time I doubled my bitcoin balance. I was very happy, I was not concerned about its prices, I wanted bitcoin and not its value in Fiat. I wanted to HODL. I had a dream to be the ***Proud owner of 1.0 BTC***. My heart was calling for it.... And thus for that dream for my heart I invested my BTC in all sort of altcoins (BCH, ETH, SC, PINK, FLDC, GTC, STR, NEM, TPC etc) and here I am today, my dream is now very far as whatever I invested is now halved. I think someday I'll be there, but to see my investment in BTC getting halved was painful. Technically I haven't lost a dime in FIAT in fact I am in profit still. What makes me sad is that my BTC balance is in loss. I am still HODLING and think that someday I'll make it... someday....
**Heart wants what it wants**

Set a target of your upper limit and lower limit.
i.e. If prices go 3200 I buy or If prices go 3000 I buy.
Prices will always fluctuate, so set your limits and then go for it.
For now you can divide 50-50. Divide the amount you wanted to buy bitcoins for with half. Buy with that and wait for a while to look at the prices(Set your limits first) And then act on it.

The deed as in the buying is done for those who already bought it. For the prices, I think they'll still go a bit lower.

There are very limited choices in India.

Its not about deciding the rates, you can do that in Zebpay, Remitano as well, but as people are getting bitcoin at higher prices they are going to sell it at higher prices too. Ultimately all Indian exchanges are fukarooz

The deed as in the buying is done. Once you have bought after that don't regret it. Never regret it.
