Here are some facts to chew on.
Dr. Craig S Wright was owner and Managing Director a company called Hotwire which [became insolvent in April 2014]( after being unable to pay salaries and creditors since February 2014. The timing is relevant as this was shortly after the collapse of Mt. Gox to which Dr. Wright had been exposed:


In order to avoid liquidation of Hotwire and instead enter into a DOCA (Deed of Company Arrangement), a company called [Panopticrypt]( of which Dr. Wright is the founder and CEO, agreed to extend a loan to Hotwire:


Panopticrypt however fails to extend the loan. On november 23th 2015, a mere 4 weeks after Dr. Wrights appearance at the [Bitcoin Investor event in Las Vegas]( the administrators note in their [circular to creditors](


In a new plan, creditors are asked to vote on a new proposal on Dec 7th, which was *last monday*.


In this variation, [DeMorgan]( which is another company owned by Dr. Wright, extends a payment which has the effect of Dr. Wright regaining control over Hotwire and the administrators retiring. The creditors are to be partially repaid but only if a tax return for FY 2014 materializes. The other option is liquidation of Hotwire by the administrators.
