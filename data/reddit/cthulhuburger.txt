I lost a 1000 bitcoin in the day. I don't really worry too much about it, I mean I've probably almost won the lottery more times than I can count too. And even if I hadn't lost it, I'm sure I would've sold when it doubled in price anyway

There's really nothing wrong with testnet, just wallets that can't handle fee pressure. Which is something they'll need to do eventually anyway.

It would work once or twice, but do it too many times and the only people winning will be programmers who have automated the claim process

The biggest joke here is that the "undercover" agent had to break the sites ToS to even place the trades.
It's really kind of embarrassing how much overt crime goes uninvestigated and unpunished, and they spend their resources on shutting down a respected and legitimate foreign operation. 
I guess the big mistake here is using the .com tld. International sites really need to use something that's not going to be arbitrarily seized by a bunch of clowns.
@_date: 2015-12-28 18:03:43
Not really. It would take a human seconds to import + sweep, something that automated software can do in milliseconds. With a high end laptop, you could scan for a QR code and sweep in almost real time. (My phone CPU for instance, only takes about 1-2 seconds).
Basically it would end up turning into a programming challenge, not a human one.

I disagree with most of this analysis. But especially this:


I think the author is underestimating the impact of a 51% attack. Sure Bitmain could pull hash power to reactively defend but there would be total chaos. Imagine if even only a few dozen BCH blocks were reorged and the mempools generally cleared (a big transaction flood), there would a huge amount of intentional and accidental double spending. Bitmain could counter this by mining on the old orphaned branch and reorg out the reorg, but it would take hours (or days?) to coordinate and catch up. The loss of confidence in BCH would be hard to understate.
For the system to realistically work, BCH chain needs to have enough hash power to stop the attack happening in the first place, rather than reacting to such attack. If the price of BCH keeps falling, it's quite likely that bitmain will be forced to mine at a loss just to ensure that the BCH chain has enough hash power to be safe.

Obviously you need to judge according to your own risk adversity, but if I was in your position I would keep it a huge secret and continue mining -- but not sell the bitcoin. Selling the bitcoin is probably the most dangerous part of the whole thing.
If someone talks to you about your high energy usage, you can say you've had electrical problems causing a short but you've just had it fixed (and at the moment you can shut off your miners).
If you keep it totally secret, I don't think your risks are that high

The website is in flagrant violation of SEC rules, so even if they're operating honestly they're going to get into a huge amount of trouble sooner or later. As soon as an insider trader comes on the site (which they seem to market to), if they're not buying the underlying instruments they'll end up losing their shirt. If they do buy the underlying instruments, they'll end up in the midst of an investigation. It's a cool idea, but I don't see how it could possible work.

Nailed it. Great post, I couldn't agree more.
I've had a reasonable question of mine removed from here, and my visceral was to side with BU and become a supporter. Since doing a bit more research, I'm now more on board with the core roadmap. 
However the moderation here is counter-productive and harmful to the bitcoin ecosystem at large. No better way to make a small group of people loud than not let them speak

This thread (and perhaps subreddit) has become overly toxic; while I too would like bigger blocks, I'd like to thank the devs for the thousands of hours they've volunteered making it a solid release.

But creating the channels are not. And a custodial wallet can amortize that cost over its user base, while a single user bares that cost by himself.  If setting up a channel costs 10 cents, it's not so much of an issue. If it costs $10, we'll have problems.
@_date: 2019-03-24 17:23:15
I think you're  confusing a few things here. So SegWit is (now) a core part of bitcoin, and basically gives a modest blocksize increase and cleans up some technical debt and makes it a bit easier to do some advanced bitcoin things.  SegWit has been very successful and well received (although adoption is lower than most would like) and should it "fail" it would be a nightmare. Although I'm not really sure how it can "fail" other than being some (currently unknown) exploit it in.
Now in contrast, the lightning network isn't really part of bitcoin. It just uses bitcoin, and has some nice properties (e.g. safe, instant and cheap transactions). Bitcoin itself would be fine if the lightning network failed, and the lightning would be fine if bitcoin failed (they could switch to using another currency).
There's a lot of other ways to scale bitcoin (e.g. sidechains), but they haven't got the same level of attention. As you mentioned increasing the blocksize is a valid and easy way to scale bitcoin.  The main problem with this is coordinating it. Unlike almost other cryptocurrencies bitcoin is kind of "leaderless" and we haven't really formalized any process around what would be involved in who can deciding to hard fork and how. I personally view this is as bitcoin's biggest strength, but also greatest weakness.

\&gt; Bitcoin's security model requires that most of the economy must use full node wallets when accepting payments.
I don't think this is really the case in any meaningful sense. There's no real difference in people using full nodes and light nodes to accept payments when you consider the inevitable human intervention. I can very easily use a light-node to accept payments (because convenience) but if it ever diverges from what a full node says, I will intervene and correct it.
So the only difference here is that a full node automates that chain-switch. 
@_date: 2019-03-11 15:56:39
\&gt; even with much smaller blocks most people wouldn't run a full node
I would even go as far as to say that smaller blocks would reduce the amount of people running a full node. While it'll use less resources to run, the actual utility would be smaller and things like custodial services will become a lot more appealing due to cost savings (e.g. coinbase-to-coinbase transfers are free, which is pretty appealing if actual transaction costs start dramatically increasing)
@_date: 2019-03-24 22:02:48
No, not at all. Even if bitcoin had infinite blocks size blocks with zero fees, the lightning network would still be useful. Lightning is just a lot more suitable for payments than bitcoin itself, as you have that sweet, sweet immediate finality. 
@_date: 2018-10-21 16:35:50
Agree. It's a great utility, and major respect to the author. But people really should be using a wallet that supports the payment protocol or just not use bitpay.
FWIW I have been using electrum to pay bitpay invoices, and really impressed by how well the UX is. I can really see why bitpay wants to enforce using it. (Although bitpay leaves a bitter taste in my mouth how they charge you the "network fee" and haven't put in the effort to minimize that by using segwit :/)

Before your transaction gets in a block, it is propagated over the network. So merely seconds after you propagate the transaction anyone watching is able to see it, and create their own transaction that spends the output -- and push that out on the network.
What would be a more fun experiment would be to transfer funds to a weak private key using opt-in RBF. That means anyone that spends it (before it confirms) is also RBF, which means anyone can replace their transaction before it's mined (by offering more mining fee). So if they're monitoring for that, two people trying to take the money could literally end up in a bidding war until they bid the entire amount in mining fees.
@_date: 2018-10-21 16:38:09
Some are compatible with each other, but it's the exception not the norm. I'd really recommend against doing though, you're exposing your private keys now to two wallets instead of one. If you switch wallets, just sweep. 
@_date: 2018-10-18 03:14:12


Fees are kind of self-regulating, as they get higher there are less cases where on-chain transactions are viable and they stop using it. We saw that when fees spiked in 2017 and a whole bunch of big merchants dropped support. Hopefully next time, some 2nd layer systems are more ready to absorb some of that load. 
@_date: 2016-11-07 19:37:32

I think a big part of that was storing firecrackers in a residential apartment building. There's some epic videos on youtube of what can go wrong when unsafely storing a lot of fireworks/firecrackers, with a lot of collateral damage. I'm pretty liberal leaning, but I'm not ok with unregulated explosives.
Although to be honest, I don't really hold it against him. No one was hurt, and he paid the (imho fair) price.
@_date: 2019-08-13 22:46:16
It's hard for me to prove a negative -- but look at any recent non-full block, and it's obviously not happening. Transactions that don't pay at least 1 sat/vbyte aren't getting relayed by any recent build of bitcoin core (as in for the last several years), thus would *massively* increase the orphan risk of mining them -- no miner is really stupid enough to do so (unless it's a special/important transaction for them) as it has huge negative value.
@_date: 2019-08-12 15:44:01
Not in practice. Miners don't include transactions paying less than 1 sat/vbyte, nor do nodes relay it. But yeah, it's possible in the same way as "you can buy a new fighter jet for $1"
@_date: 2019-08-20 02:17:43


CSW is a fraud, but that's hardly fair. You don't need HD wallets to have a seed phrase. A trivial example would be the input to [srand]( and calling rand() for each new address.  Granted int is not a big enough space to be secure, but that's a trivial change. This is not an HD wallet, because you can't share a master public key, but it also allows you to have a single seed for your entire wallet.
@_date: 2019-02-05 07:59:25
That's really exactly what this is doing, just in a standardized way.  But both are not particularly practical as they reveal your entire utxo, something no business is going to want to do for privacy reasons. I can see it being useful for maybe providing to a trusted auditor though
@_date: 2019-02-05 08:16:15
Could you define what you mean by a "non-2-way peg", from my reading you can put bitcoin in and eventually get that bitcoin back? Doesn't that make it 2-way? Or is there some meaning here I'm missing
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:30:42
No it shouldn't. Bitcoin miners order transactions based on sat/weight,  which is linear to sat/vbyte. So it's silly to show sat/byte.
Personally I hate vbytes, I think they cause a lot more confusion than it solves. I'd rather everyone just uses weight directly.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:08:02
I'm struggling to tell if you're intentionally being as disingenuous as possible. But out of interest, what % of payments do you really think are or are going to be 1-input-1-output?
Also if all you care about is a "how many totally useless transactions per second" can we make, segwit actually decreases that number (due to a byte it adds).
@_date: 2019-04-08 15:55:13


It's a little misleading though, considering even with full utilization of native segwit, we're unlikely to *average* over 2MB blocks.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:12:27
Not if it's being disingenuous. If you're talking about capacity planning for a highway, it might be technically correct that it can handle transporting a  million people per hour; but if your calculation was derived based on how many people liquified could fit in tank trucks; it's not being productive.
And I think that's pretty analogous to saying "We already have up to 4MB blocks" when it's based on a how much a single spam/attack transaction (Which isn't even standard) could cause a block to be.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:04:00
While I understand the sentiment, there are also significant costs to high fees which you are not addressing. Higher fees decrease bitcoins utility, which pushes use-cases to 2nd-layer (which itself isn't purely good) and to altcoins.
The fee market also brings an insane amount of complexity to bitcoin. With altcoins I can create a reliable wallet by simply setting the feeRate to a fixed amount, and propagate. With bitcoin we have CPFP, RBF, fee-estimates that are complex enough *not a single wallet* handles it all well. High-fees also forces users to work on complex optimizations (e.g daily batch sends).
Bitcoin itself has a lot going for it: first-mover advantage, network effect, most decentralized crypto. But I don't think it's reasonable to expect bitcoin to survive-long term if it has painfully high fees either.
I think we need to aim at a future where fees are balanced between too low (see: tragedy of commons problems) and too high (see: decreased utility)
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:54:49
Your own figures don't even close to work.
The weight of your transaction is:  83*4 + (73 + 34) = 439 weight.  And the size is: 83 + 73 + 34 = 190 bytes.
So the weight limit for a block is 4,000,000  ... which means we can fit 9111 of these transactions in (actually a bit less if you include the coinbase).  Multiply that by the size and voila a: 1.73MB block...
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:47:52


A good example of a 2nd-layer that people use today extensively would be coinbase. High base-layer fees incentivize to stay on coinbase and take advantage of free coinbase&lt;-&gt;coinbase transfers. There's some pros (less load on bitcoin) and there's some cons (centralization, single-point-of-failure risks).
But I do envy your ability to see the world in such black and white.
@_date: 2019-04-08 16:33:40
Last time I tried to calculate it, if everyone switched to native segwit (i.e. transactions still had the same amount of inputs/outputs) we'd be averaging like ~1.8MB blocks. So being generous to future optimization (like increased batching), I think 2MB is being pretty fair.
@_date: 2019-04-08 17:15:59


No. Because if you're trying to create a "totally useless transaction" you don't even need a witness. So segwit is strictly worse for creating "totally useless transactions".
So technically: a segwit block, full of only segwit transactions has less maximal transaction capacity than a non-segwit block with no segwit transactions.
(Of course, I'm assuming the ridiculous case of spending OP_TRUE outputs).
But again, these artificial cases are realllly stupid. Segwit is cool stuff, there's no reason to be dishonest about it.
@_date: 2019-04-08 20:52:21
I was referring to all the fee management stuff. For instance the core wallet doesn't properly calculate CPFP fees (when sending from an unconfirmed transaction), nor can reliably fee bump. No wallets that I'm aware of have a "monitor" mode, that watches and progressively bumps your transaction (according to a schedule) to get into a block.
I'm not trying to assign blame, I'm just saying it's really complex and unsolved stuff.
@_date: 2019-04-23 15:34:55
I really like how you're using time (e.g. 1 hour) instead of blocks. It's a bit harder to model, but definitely worth it.
One thing the site is really begging to have would be a chart of your fee data, with the three lines (optimistic, standard, cautious). 
And to help make the feeRate more understandable, it would help to show how much a transaction (say native segwit, 1 input, 2 output) would cost in absolute terms (i.e. bitcoin and usd)
@_date: 2018-11-05 19:30:23
A disk stores "size", not weight. This means a full-block will be between 1MB and 4MB in size (depending how much is witness data). Only segwit transactions can have witness data. However it's pretty very unlikely for blocks to ever (average) bigger than 2MB, as to have so much witness data would be rather atypical.  I think realistic estimates are around \~1.6M average block size for full blocks once everyone is using segwit.  (But of course someone can create a almost 4MB block by creating a single transaction with a huge witness, but it'd be kind of pointless and expensive)
@_date: 2018-11-05 14:32:51
You are correct, they do not take up less space. They actually take up an every so slightly more (a couple bytes per transaction).
However bitcoin's block limit is now represented in weight, not space. And segwit transactions take up a significant less amount of weight than legacy ones.
@_date: 2019-09-09 04:05:21
Nothing. But the original (and new) transaction doesn't directly pay anyone, but holds the funds in a sort of limbo state, until: both parties approve, an elapsed time has passed or you can prove this state was an old state.
So if you broadcast an old transaction, the funds will get transferred to a place where the other party can take them all.
@_date: 2019-09-26 18:22:10


The space-savings aren't that great. A "merged" transaction would only save something like 12 bytes compared to two individual transactions. The only real benefit now is going to be privacy wise. If people are "merging" transactions, it breaks some of the most powerful heuristics analysts use for tracing bitcoin.
If we get something called "signature aggregation" there could be some pretty big space savings associated with "merged" transactions. But honestly, there's no way that's happening in the near-term future (and contrary to popular belief, schnorr signatures will not give you that. It's just a stepping stone to make it more practical)

Nope. The hard fork is a blocksize _decrease_. Quoting from the the BIP:




Prior to that, segit has a 4000000 (WU / byte) limit.

@_date: 2017-05-23 23:40:05
For the non-technical people here, this is a troll. It's a proposal that would limit the blocksize compared to segwit. (In segwit, the max blocksize is 4MB this proposal limits it to 2MB).
It's obviously a troll because if that was desirable, it would be part of segwit itself (as a soft fork) and it turns transaction selection into a packing problem, which segwit weights were designed to prevent.
@_date: 2017-05-23 23:37:00
If you think he's being straight forward, logical and reasonable -- then he's achieved his goal of misleading you.  The whole BIP is just a troll, by playing with semantics to make his hard fork _reduce_ the blocksize compared to segwit alone (which if was actually desirable, would just be part of segwit change itself).
The compromise "2MB" solution obviously refers to 2MB of non-witness data (i.e. a blocksize increase).
