Now that you have been mining with the TM for a few days, what are your thoughts on it? Has there been a steady hash speed and steady power draw? Has Cointerra sent you any new firmware upgrades? Thanks!

5, with it hashing at a 20% reduction, I'm missing out on a whole machine. I hope they can play around with the firmware to get it stable and a higher hash speed.

Do you still need to store the TM in a cool place even though they are liquid cooled already? Does the web GUI show the operating temperatures of the ASICs? I would like to store mine under 5 separate desks so no one sees them.

You have implemented work-arounds? I hope we don't have to jump through hoops as well. I hope their new firmware release takes care of it.

For me when I pre-ordered my miners, I would have been able to purchase about 220 bitcoins, today they would be worth $175,230, I would have made $142,230 but no one knows when it's going to take off. Right now I stand to mine approx 40 new bitcoins a month @ 3B difficulty. 
Also if I would have bought then I would only have 220 bitcoins, with mining it just grows (aside of expenses)
It's a catch 22, the rate could have went down then maybe the difficulty wouldn't rise so fast but we just don't know.
I am also in it for the foundation of bitcoins. I will be one of MANY that does the transactions for so many. I think I'm going to cold storage about 80% of what I mine for about a year.

Thanks for being the guinea pig and giving us your findings.

The warehouse that I will be hosting at does have 20 amp breakers but using 90.9% of the breaker isn't ideal. Although running an extra 5 long extension cords doesn't make sense either.
At least I have some options.
Thanks for the reply.

Each pulls 1kw... would you know how many amps it pulls?
Does it really need to be powered by 2 separate circuits @ 15 amps? Thanks!
