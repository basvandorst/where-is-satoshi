let's digest a bit more. ok I got your argument for now, btc is not functional payment system able to do things like visa, yet none of crypto is (bcash, etc.). And again, lightning net is just a promising future. Few quotes:
Instant Payments. "Lightning-fast blockchain payments without worrying about block confirmation times. Security is enforced by blockchain smart-contracts without creating a on-blockchain transaction for individual payments. Payment speed measured in milliseconds to seconds."
Scalability. "Capable of millions to billions of transactions per second across the network. Capacity blows away legacy payment rails by many orders of magnitude. Attaching payment per action/click is now possible without custodians."
Low fees. Nearing zero.
and cross chain compatibility.
few remarks on the price of btc:
check this gold graph 
before there was a huge liquidity in gold(hundreds of billion $) volatility was huge - as the volatility of bitcoin right now. Then market decided what it is - an asset - not currency. No other currency has graph like bitcoin or gold. 
just for the sake of discussion and  for full disclosure could you please acknowledge if you own any eth or bcash?

This is not at all what I would say - but in some sense you re right. But still, 'real' money is not going anywhere for some time. Use them for your 5$ transaction, and percive btc as an investment, or even better, perceive it as probable trajectory of socio-economic evolution.

Sure it has its cons.we all Wait for lightning network that should solve this small transactions issue.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:15:52
but isn't it still a good asset with regard to all its pros (decentralization, etc.). would you still call it a bubble?

SOme of your arguments just resembled me arguments of bcash holders. So I wanted to be sure. 
I **totally** agree that huge part of community is just toxic. I assume they won't be able to hold it long enough (correction is coming) - so my hypotheses is that they will continually leave the chain. *just a hypotheses*


Not even http was back in the days intended to be supported by other layers. Would you say that https is a bad idea then? This is not a valid argument i'd say. It's like going to Ford factory around 1908 and telling engineers - "guys you got only one shot - do it now and no more adjustments". This is just not how it works.

Well I gues you're right. Still what are you trying to propose? Bitcoin is a speculative bubble? 
@_date: 2017-11-27 08:43:42
Bitcoin value is in the net it created - new payment system with all its benefits.

I do not understand how segwit can makes bloks bigger. What I know is that witness is no longer in inputs but in witness part of transaction, but still those bytes are in transaction data (just smaller). How is it that blocks can be 2mb now? Isn't there a limit of 1mb?

Why multiply by 4?
@_date: 2018-07-12 22:04:32
Will take me some time to swallow... thanks for your answers
@_date: 2018-07-12 21:44:50
but any idea why 4? Why not 5?

Thanks Donald.
