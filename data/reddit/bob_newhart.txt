Plus you can use margin to lower your risk. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:47:00
300 ether for me. And 100eth/USD short order from ,10.50
@_date: 2016-08-26 04:11:01
Thanks for the clarification. That's what I mean was counter party risk. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:47:09
How are they transferrable
@_date: 2016-08-08 01:08:05
Huh. Never heard of that. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:45:58
Yeah but I want to sale MY tokens not buy others. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:40:39
the mobile number on my account is old. I no longer have access to that number. How do I update this since 2fa is mandatory to login.  I have submitted a ticket but I am anxious to get into my account. 
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:51:47
I'm curious how they will be transferrable. As fast as they were created it just seems like it's part of bitfinex programming not on a chain. 
@_date: 2016-08-16 03:08:13
Look at cloudatcost
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:44:58
Only if they are transferrable. How is that going to work? Are the on a chain somewhere?
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:46:19
Haha. That's kind of awesome. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:35:41
I love this. I love anything today even if it's 0 and 2% per month
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:40:46
So what happens to my short position in eth if eth rallies and my order is still active when the system comes back up? I had a trailing stop loss on it..
@_date: 2016-04-22 06:02:54
I'm thinking of starting a shaving supply shop. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 04:43:10
This is best plan tbh. I would be willing to get haircut on eth balance if it meant no bankruptcy or lawsuits and there was a repayment plan.  
@_date: 2016-08-08 00:52:44
Just anxious to get in. I'm fomo'ing a little on the bfx tokens.

How do I prepare to participate in the launch?

Has there ever been a double spend?
@_date: 2015-06-24 02:03:58
Awesome thought. 
@_date: 2014-02-26 03:42:48
I don't understand this sentiment/line of thinking/strategy. I have seen this elsewhere as well. Why wait until it stabilizes? Are you afraid btc is going to drop further in price? Do you not think there is a gain to be made at this price? It looks to me(and I am probably wrong) that $440 would have been the perfect price to get in last night. These are legitimate questions. I am just trying to understand yourself and others who have expressed this. 
@_date: 2014-05-31 07:16:52
Do you know what the ingredients are in this? Most ecig juice is a mixture of propelyne glycol, vegetable glycerin, and water.  If its similar to this then it should work.

Can you explain who neo and bee are and what they do?
@_date: 2014-10-11 04:13:22
Couldn't they implement bittorent somehow to do this?
@_date: 2014-08-01 04:02:19
Or you can just exchange the IOUs. It doesn't ever have to be converted into stellars(xrp for ripple).
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:40:37
Best pun ever!
@_date: 2014-06-08 07:24:51
Mang huh? Are your from the 90's? 
@_date: 2014-07-10 02:07:22
Don't you have to send it from coinbase to your wallet though?
@_date: 2014-04-05 01:19:07
This is the best misunderstanding I have seen all week. 
@_date: 2014-08-25 02:47:48
Do you work for bodog?
@_date: 2014-08-01 18:02:34
That's where trust comes in. The system distinguishes where the IOUs came from. So, let's say coinbase btc IOUs are going to be valued more than diapolis btc IOUs because its an established org. If you wanted to be a gateway you could issue btc or USD or any type of assert you want. Who will value those asserts or IOUs on the system though will depend upon who trusts you to be able to pay if they want to redeem the IOU for the asset it signifies. 
@_date: 2014-10-17 01:41:25

@_date: 2014-05-06 03:14:07
20 xrp is the current reserve. 
@_date: 2014-03-25 04:38:36
Can't you already do this with ripple?
@_date: 2014-04-30 00:14:46
I think most redditors lack the knowledge how.

They can if they are doing it at the manufacturer with their approval. There are reports that some of the big router manufacturers are doing this with their network equipment.

That came out snarkier than I meant it to. I'm sorry. I haven't seen mang in a long time. It used to be popular on the irc in the late 90's early 00's.

I don't think you meant DRM this way, but imagine kuerig implementing its current DRM using this technology.

Preferable somewhere with recurring automated buys. 
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:30:14
The freeze feature is built into ripple but it is up to the gateways if they want to use it. And the internal ripple currency,xrp, cannot be frozen. It also has no counterparts risk
@_date: 2015-01-17 16:11:38
That is correct! 
@_date: 2016-03-26 04:54:36
Do they confiscate your coins when this happens?
@_date: 2015-01-17 04:23:04

Has there been much slippage in the conversion price your getting compared to other exchanges?
@_date: 2016-03-01 09:29:48
Are there fees? I am currently doing something similar with coinbase recurring buys but this sounds like a better solution.  
@_date: 2015-05-31 22:16:21
My question is why shouldn't we be able to do this. What if there was a network that was able to handle this. We should be able to send the transaction for every block if we want too.

I use it to do automated weekly buys. I have seen lots of posts on reddit of this happening though. I don't know if sending to another wallet before using back pages would work. I would ask support before signing up and what you want to use it for to see if this would happen.

May I recommend the hive bar. I was there last year for a conference and it is a cool place. Has over 300 beers.  Another cool place is call whiskey street I think. I met an analyst there one night that really gave me some great advice that helped me in my career.

@_date: 2016-09-19 03:50:06
Yep that's it. They have great selection of whiskey also if your into drinking whiskey.  The beer hive pub was what the other place was called, not the hive bar. Its got ambience and one of those cool ice bars.

Don't tell me what to do!
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:11:24
Not just an argument. I believe he entered into a contract with ripple labs agreeing to only sell a certain amount of his xrps per week. If these were jeds funds then he did break this agreement. I think the question or argument  from jed is that these were not his funds but a gift to a family member.
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:48:23
Just wanted to say to everyone who might not know, this poster is the original creater of the ripple protocol.
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:41:58
If this happened with a btc balance at an exchange would this be a failure of bitcoin? I feel this is the most important question that you didn't answer

Freemont is awesome and I would have to agree.
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:52:25

Where can I read more about the social network concensus? 
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:36:25
Wow! I bet your right on this one. Never even thought of that the past couple of days. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 05:44:41
It was usd because whoever the account owner was already sold the xrp. Was this even a function of the freeze tag in ripple or was it an on exchange axcount?
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:16:19
Also would this mean that bitcoin is a failure?
@_date: 2015-04-22 09:38:20
Well that's true. But they could have done the same thing with a bitcoin balance held at bitstamps Bitcoin ezchange.
Edit:just wanted to clarify my post that it is true ripple labs requested the freeze, not ripple, which is the underlying protocol  
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:00:15
It's more like PayPal with an exchange built into it that anyone can trade on.
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:21:00
Ripple labs does not host any gateways  
@_date: 2015-04-03 23:49:02

It's close to the 8 yr anniversary. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:19:23
To be fair to his comments seem to be fairly balanced and we'll informed. It doesn't seem like he is attacking ripple.
@_date: 2015-04-01 03:37:35
What if force froze accounts, stole the btc, and accounted for the money. 
@_date: 2015-04-23 06:05:51
FYI your talking to the original creator of ripple, Ryan Fugger.  Ripple has been around for years.
@_date: 2015-04-22 10:18:33
Great question!
@_date: 2015-04-22 06:33:35

I think your making it seem harder than necessary to split. These are folks who figured out how to get ether and then get dao tokens. That is no simple task. Figuring out how to split from the dao is not a huge step after that.

Agree with you that there are some scams going on right now. I also think there are legitimate businesses trying to get funding, but will fail also. It's going to be an interesting next few weeks/months. I honestly don't know where this ends. The current state of the Bitcoin and what happens in August is going to be interesting also. Could bitcoin's price reflect the markets belief that there will be 2 coins?
