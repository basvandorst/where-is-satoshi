Facebook will respond by saying “we are open to our customers using any wallet that we do not create” which will be a good enough answer for those who don’t understand; however, we all know they can track the blockchain *just the same* regardless of if you use their wallet or not.

What would you prefer instead? 
I often get tripped out about how everyone hates every company that allows this space to thrive. “Fuck Coinbase. Fuck Binance. Fuck square. Fuck everyone.” Well, what other on ramps are left? How do you expect adoption without things like this? 
@_date: 2019-03-13 22:40:58
Lol that just comes from your phone tracking habits. You probably just tend to check bitcoin at that time every day

Yeah, the ability to mine on a CPU, which everyone had access to. That ability no longer exists; if you want to obtain bitcoin without one of these institutions, you either need to know someone who has bitcoins and want to sell them, or you need to invest thousands of dollars into ASICS, neither which are very accessible to 99% of people. 
Times have changed. So what - you just want you and your small group of early adopters to play with this technology and for the rest of the world to never get to see it unless they have the insane capital to mine themselves? How convenient, for you. 
Stop being selfish. We can criticize Coinbase all day - I agree that they do stupid shit. But to claim that all on ramps shouldn’t exist is fucking stupid. 
@_date: 2019-03-16 06:42:42
That’s what killed it for me man. 
This sub talks about crypto. r/BTC almost only exclusively talks about r/Bitcoin and shitting on bitcoin. Anything else is somehow spun into something fucking weird 
@_date: 2019-11-16 01:31:22


So.. you prefer an asset that rapidly loses its value the more it’s used compared to one that historically increases in value (not to mention the ability to live in it)?
@_date: 2018-10-05 00:45:11
Look to your closest wall. Walk halfway to it. Okay, now walk halfway from your new point to the wall. Walk half way again. Again. Again. Because you are always splitting the distance between you and the wall by 2, you will never touch the wall (but you will get *damn* close).
Bitcoin mining, and the intended halvenings of mining rewards, work the same way. 
Edit: after more research, I guess I am wrong.
I suppose it works more along the lines of “cut the distance in half, then move 1/Xth of that distance for 210,000 steps. Then, cut the distance in half again, repeat.” Eventually, because you are still moving towards the wall (albeit at a slower pace each time,) you *will* eventually hit the wall. 
@_date: 2018-10-04 16:30:06
It looks like they regularly post in r/td, I’m sure that nothing this person does makes any sense at all (if they aren’t a bot). 
@_date: 2018-10-05 04:24:39
I wholeheartedly agree; I thought that I knew but of course I had misunderstood. Thanks for the feedback!
@_date: 2018-10-05 02:40:33
Okay - first, try not to get your panties in a bunch.  Being an asshole helps no one here, yourself included. Why not try to explain things *without* being a condescending twat? The more people that understand, the better. You are not doing bitcoin any favors with your elitist attitude.
I was under the impression that the halvenings would continue forever, where the reward gets cut in half every 210,000 blocks that are mined, and an asymptote towards 21M bitcoins would occur where that value would never be reached. Simple math. 
Can you provide any resources to back up your claim?
 Edit: nvm, did some research myself and now I understand. 
Still, your attitude is only harming the community. How about we help each other instead of shit on each other, eh?
@_date: 2018-10-02 04:39:46
How will you, as the agent, deal with taxes and all of that? Or is your plan to use this as an opportunity to avoid all of that?
@_date: 2018-10-05 07:27:32
Fair enough, I can’t argue with that 
@_date: 2018-10-19 20:29:49
I mean that’s the other part of the story; would you risk losing $1M in a single bitcoin transaction just to save $50 in bank transfer fees? (Assuming others in this thread are correct about a flat $50 fee). 
I sure as hell would pay $50 to make sure I don’t accidentally lose a million dollars from a typo or a malicious chrome extension. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 20:31:12
Wow - new information that I definitely don't see in this sub once every 2 weeks! Thanks OP!
@_date: 2018-10-04 23:38:46
In theory the last bitcoin will *never* be mined. 
Edit: I was wrong 
@_date: 2019-08-08 00:40:44
I’m going to be completely honest with you here. 
If you cannot figure out how to security store your crypto on a hardware wallet (and understanding that you must manually verify addresses to prevent the attack you experienced - Ledger Nano S reminds you to double check), than I strongly recommend you go one of two routes.
1.) Don’t invest any more of your capital into crypto. *Especially* because you have just put a massive target on your back for being easy to rob due to technological incompetence. You can bet there are people viewing this thread who will start phishing attempts on you. Be alert. 
2.) Only hold GBTC on something like ETrade where your funds are insured and unhackable in this way. You will have to pay the premium. That’s life. 
Your responses in this thread so far have given me very little confidence that you will not fall to a similar attack in the future. You either need to spend a lot - I mean *a lot* - of time to learn about this technology, it’s risks, and proper risk mitigation practices, or you need to ensure that you cannot fall victim to this again which involves custodianship. 
Good luck out there man. I am sorry to hear about your loss - just want to make sure it doesn’t happen to you again.
Edit: OH MY GOD YOU HAVE YOUR NAME AND OCCUPATION IN YOUR FUCKING REDDIT PROFILE. CHANGE THAT ASAP
@_date: 2019-08-07 23:33:12
Don’t use any of those. 
Get a hardware wallet. I mean Jesus Christ - you just lost 15k and can’t be bothered to spend $100 on a device that *literally* prevents this attack from being possible? 
Blows my fucking mind that you see antivirus software as your answer here.
