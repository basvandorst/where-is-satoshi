26, M, Rock Climber, but work in Finance/Health Care.  Didn't buy in much at first, but have more than doubled investment since April.

A correction to the mean was overdue.  I'm surprised value spiked as high as it did.  There is still plenty of value in the utility of Bitcoin as it finds its niche in the financial marketplace, it's not an overnight process.  Just wait for the dust to settle and buy more coins.  This is part of the Bitcoin ride.  Those of us that made it through April and the smaller crashes before should feel just fine.

Graph BTC over the last two years and then compare it against [this graph](
I rode out the last bubble in April, bought at market peak around $150-$200/coin, watched everything I invested tank, but also just saw value skyrocket over the last month or two.  A return to the mean is necessary, but the inherent utility and value of BTC still remains.  Hang in there, if you expected to get rich overnight you're in for a long ride.

Likewise - I've cashed out of BTC through coinbase to Chase and had no issues.  However, there are plenty of reasons to close your Chase account anyway, as I have done and opened up elsewhere.  Chase is not a good company, I used to work there, so the culture is cut-throat and absurd, not to mention it was founded by a guy who used to buy faulty rifles for $3 and sell them for $20 and wasn't liable when people got seriously injured due to family ties within the government.  On top of that the company should be charged for criminal conduct, but because its CEO Jamie Dimon is best friends with Obama administration the company keeps settling unprecedented lawsuits ($13Bil I believe) and avoids criminal charges.

Very true, I wasn't cut out for it.  I prefer climbing rocks.


Thank you for informing me even further about which I had no idea.  And yes, considering the state of the bank currently, it has fallen quite far from its roots that I was admittedly ignorant about.

All dependent on demand psychology.  Price of BTC back in March hovered around $50 and spiked 5x to over $250 before correcting when it made a name for itself.  Now it was hovering steadily around $150 before this spike, so it wouldn't be absurd to see $700, but I personally doubt it will make it that high this round.  With the potential positive as thousands coupled with the influx of major market investments it's just another wild ride to watch.

Indeed. Capital One was the lesser of two evils for now.

I understand.  This was my beef at first because damn is Chase Online solid.  I ended up going with CapitalOne360.  They have an ATM locator and no foreign transaction fees so everything is reimbursed.  Seemed to be the only logical option.  I also switched my Chase Freedom card to a Capital One card... Quicksilver which has no foreign transaction fees as well.
