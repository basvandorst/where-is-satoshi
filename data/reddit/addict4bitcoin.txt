It depends. Are you looking for a get rich quick scheme, if so when do you plan to pull out, or are you looking for a decentralized peer to peer currency and if so wouldn't you be on the lookout for one that can scale doesn't have outrageous fees and a huge backlog of transactions...

Take a good look at this and tell me where all this new money is going 
@_date: 2014-01-05 06:40:07
So you don't have to register:
The World Bank announced some good and counterintuitive news recently: that its measure of the portion of the world’s population in extreme poverty has fallen significantly in the past few years, even in the face of the 2008 financial crisis.
If that news sounds a little bit too good to be true, well, it is. Cheap credit, monetary easing and rampant deficit spending have flooded the globe with paper currency—more than $2 trillion in newly printed dollars since 2008 alone. All that money has to have somewhere to go—rising wages are one result, rising prices another—including prices on that commodity most precious to the very poor, food.
The World Bank report “shows a broad-based reduction in extreme poverty,” The New York Times reports:
The report shows that for the first time the proportion of people living in extreme poverty – on less than $1.25 a day – fell in every developing region between 2005 and 2008. And the biggest recession since the Great Depression seems not to have thrown that trend off course, preliminary data from 2010 indicate.
The progress is so dramatic that the world has met the United Nations' Millennium Development Goals to cut extreme poverty in half five years before its 2015 deadline.
Established in 1944, the World Bank grew out of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, charged with overseeing reconstruction following World War II. Over the years the World Bank Group has grown to include the International Development Association, the International Finance Corporation, the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency, and the International Centre for the Settlement of Investment Disputes. As its Website explains:
World Bank is like a cooperative, made up of 187 member countries. These member countries, or shareholders, are represented by a Board of Governors, who are the ultimate policymakers at the World Bank. Generally, the governors are member countries' ministers of finance or ministers of development. They meet once a year at the Annual Meetings of the Boards of Governors of the World Bank Group and the International Monetary Fund.
Reconstruction remains an important part of our work. However, at today's World Bank, poverty reduction through an inclusive and sustainable globalization remains the overarching goal of our work.
Translated, despite its lofty tagline declaring it to be “Working for a World Free of Poverty,” the World Bank is funded, administered and led by the same governments, central bankers and financial establishment who depend upon the continual expansion of debt and of the fiat currency supply in order to ensure the survival of our current global monetary system.
Meaning it just might have incentive to present data in a way that downplays the very real detrimental effects of currency debasement on the world’s most vulnerable people.
The World Bank’s poverty line for the poorest of the poor $1.25 in Purchasing-Power-Parity (PPP) dollars, as reported in The Economist late last year.
By the World Bank's definition, you are poor if your purchasing power (i.e., your command over goods and services) is less than that of an American subsisting on $1.25 a day in 2005.
But the World Bank's poverty line is not set at market exchange rates. It's $1.25 in 2005 Purchasing-Power-Parity (PPP) dollars. By the World Bank's definition, you are poor if your purchasing power (i.e., your command over goods and services) is less than that of an American subsisting on $1.25 a day in 2005…
This point is I think still poorly understood. When people hear that almost 1.4 billion (1,374m) people live on less than a $1.25 a day, they comfort themselves with the thought that a dollar stretches much further in a poor country than it does in America. They may have fond memories of backpacking around India or Guatemala on a shoestring during their younger days. But that is false comfort. The World Bank knows full well that a dollar packs more punch in a poor country. When it says someone is living on $1.25 a day, it means they are living on what that would buy you in America in 2005, not what it would buy you in Guatemala, India or China.
We at WealthCycles have little faith in the veracity of income data as priced in fiat currencies such as the dollar. So using the World Bank’s calculator feature, we created our own chart showing the number of people living below the poverty line in 2008, as compared to 1999. Our chart, however, measures the poverty level not in dollars but in real money, gold. In 1999, it would have taken you $300 to buy one ounce of gold; in 2008, it would have taken you $900 to buy one ounce of gold—a three-fold increase between 1999 and 2008.
In the chart below, we look at the monthly poverty line income of $38.00 per month for 1999; then we multiplied that income by three to come up with the “real money” poverty line for 2008. As the chart shows, both the total number of poor and the percentage of poor in the population increased.
 1999 World Bank Calculator
2008 World Bank Calculator
And although the proportion of “extremely poor” has fallen as measured by the World Bank, it reports the number of people in the rank just above, those living on between $1.25 and $2.00, has doubled between 1981 and 2008, as Patel notes for the Financial Times.
Of course, a lot has changed since 2008. As we mentioned earlier, some $2 trillion plus in new currency has been pumped into the global economy in a desperate quest to reinflate the world back to the bubble years, and not surprisingly, inflation, in the form of higher prices, has grown accordingly. The fallout from the crisis also worked to boost the economy of the developing world.

Eventually all fiat currencies tank. It's been tested and proven time and time again so that's a guarantee. Will bitcoin be the thing to take over when that happens only the free market can decide. But to trade bitcoin to hold dollars and feel rich is silly. Either buy something you need/want, invest in real assets like gold or silver or hang onto your bitcoins.

Even if its not the best for in person transactions, handing in small amounts its not worth the trouble of double spending. It definitely is better for online purchases were handing cash isn't an option to cut out the fees and there is nothing comparable when you just want to send money to a friend or give a donation online or in person.

I see the necessity of some sort of fee in the  future the fact that its already happening now while there are still bitcoin rewards makes me think that as much as people say the price is determined by the people using bitcoin the reality is its determined by the big miners. If visa spend an easy 1billion dollars to set up a bitcoin processing plant they could take over and force the fee up. Not because they're not making enough money already but simply because they could be making even more.

I wasn't saying that the only way to exchange would be in the stock market. It's just that now to trade you need to put your money in the hands of mtgox ect who have the power to artificially change the price and volume of trades.

I am strongly against fees of any kind for fear of what they could become in the future when there is much less mining rewards. If people get used to paying fees it won't be long before the big pools get together and refuse anything without a larger fee and then larger until we are paying western union level fees just to use our bitcoins defeating their purpose. If I can't send without fees I refuse to use it. (luckily for now I can send without fees as long as I'm not just sending it back and forth to myself clogging the blockchain which is a good thing)

I don't understand why there has to be a fee when miners get rewarded by the system for mining. I refuse to ever pay any fee as long as new bitcoins are being mined. If that means I can't use bitcoin for anything else besides a store of (potential) value so be it. I think it's disgusting that bitcoinqt forces fees and gives me a small fear of what it could become. Imagine visa and mastercard both invested millions in mining equipment to the point where anyone else who mined would make next to nothing and then went about slowly raising the fees by not accepting transactions into the blockchain. Please don't just down vote because you don't like the idea but explain where I may have gone wrong. Thanks.

When the 2008 crisis hit, investors pulled out of traditional markets as developed nations reeled and succumbed to recession. Looking for somewhere safe to park their wealth, investors turned to emerging markets and commodities, which pushed commodities prices higher, also helping developing nations. In sub-Saharan Africa, the World Bank reports the proportion of the population living in extreme poverty has fallen below 50% for the first time. A recent Financial Times report looks at the wealth that has flowed into the country in the past few years:                                                                                               
Fuelled by booming oil exports, boosted by higher commodity prices, funded by cheap loans from China and by returning capital from the diaspora, as well as by foreign investment, Africa’s social and physical landscape is being reshaped.
The most dramatic statistical decreases in poverty levels have occurred in east Asia, writes Keyur Patel for the Financial Times:
China’s economic boom helped 662m people escape poverty over the period although, in 2008, 173m were still living below the $1.25 threshold. In the developing world outside China, the poverty rate fell from 41 per cent to 25 per cent – but because of the increasing world population, the total number living in poverty was unchanged at around 1.1bn.
But China also is struggling with the unintended consequences of currency deflation. Because it has consistently (until very recently) exported far more goods than it is imported, its economy, too, has been flooded with currency. (For more on this, see the WealthCycles.com article, China’s Big Accumulation.) The excess currency fueled a real estate bubble in China, fueling speculation, overbuilding and pushing  housing costs out of reach for those supposedly being lifted from poverty. China’s vast “ghost cities” are the visible evidence of the struggle. (See WealthCycles.com’s The Monster That Ate The Economy.)
As always happens when new currency flows in, nominal incomes in those nations rose, but so did prices.
Because the very poor spend a larger proportion of their incomes on food than more affluent people do, the trend to rising food prices has been particularly devastating. The 2011 annual food price index increased 24% over 2010, according to the Word Bank’s Food Watch. Yes, many people in India, China and Africa are earning higher wages. But how much more are they paying to buy a bag of rice or a loaf of bread?
Even as official poverty rates have fallen, malnutrition, exacerbated by rising food prices, continues to be a tragic and costly plague on many developing countries. Anjili Raval writes for the Financial Times:
[W]hile the reasons for tackling malnutrition have been widely reported, the economic case is often overlooked. Billions of dollars are wasted in forgone productivity and avoidable healthcare spending.
According to “A Life Free from Hunger: Tackling Child Malnutrition“, a report by charity Save the Children, 2.6m children die every year as a result of malnutrition, a huge loss in the workforces of affected countries. For those that survive, the lack of nutritious food together with infection and illness means that their bodies and brains do not develop in the way they should – which inevitably hinders the economic progress of a nation. At least 170m children are affected by stunting worldwide.
As much as 3 per cent of the gross domestic product of a country is wiped out to malnutrition, reducing the productivity of people trying to work their way out of poverty in the world’s poorest countries. The World Bank puts the annual cost of malnutrition across the 20 highest-burden countries at $121bn in 2010 .
The report from Save the Children suggests that tackling malnutrition in early life can lead to as much as a 46 per cent increase in earnings as an adult.
In the same article, Raval recounts the example of Vietnam, where between 1990 and 2009, GDP per capita rose on average some 6% per  year. The percentage of children stunted by malnutrition also fell during that period, but more slowly—4%-- than GDP rose. Increases in GDP do not necessarily translate to better nutrition.
At the end of the day, currency debasement is conducted not for the benefit of the world’s poor, but for the benefit of those who control the world’s wealth, those with a vested interest in sustaining the global fiat currency system.
Austrian economist Ludwig von Mises wrote in Money and Inflation:
The problem is not to increase the quantity of money. The problem is to increase the quantity of those things which can be bought with money. And if you are increasing the quantity of money, and you are not increasing the quantity of things which can be bought with money, you are only increasing the prices which are paid for them. And in time, if the increase in money continues, the whole system becomes a system without any meaning and really without any possible method of dealing with it.
The poor need, not more paper currency, but more of the things it can buy. A currency system designed to steal wealth from its users is no way to combat world poverty.

Theres a good idea! Why cant currency creation be given directly to all citizens equally? People hate the idea of receiving foodstamps and look down at people who get them ect. but I think if you're really going to debase our currency with inflation you should just give every american citizen foodstamps. That'll spur the economy right away, and help those who are struggling without making them feel bad.
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:50:24
It's just that readjusting the currency supply is unnecessary when the inflation rate is predetermined and there's no guessing. If everyone decided they wanted to save it might hurt the economy but it would increase the value of each bitcoin and the same steady supply of new btc would keep coming and if everyone decided they needed to spend right away it would spur the economy and allow a redistribution of wealth though each individual bitcoin would be worth less. But with Federal reserve notes if they print too much we go into hyperinflation if they stop printing altogether everyone holds causing a serious depression.
@_date: 2015-01-16 22:09:52
I think the point is there doesnt have to be powerful miners, even at $10 a coin the reward is $500 so someone will always be mining. The question is after the rewards stop altogether and no one wants to mine without fees will people transacting just pay fees like cc or will the network lose power
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:06:49
They become unprofitable at a certain hashrate. If all the miners left I could mine on my old laptop and crank an easy profit at $1 a coin. So there will *always be someone mining. 
*as long as btc have some value, if theres a fundamental problem with the system revealed like an easy method to find the secret address from the public then everyone leaves and no one mines.

I really value dialogue like this, thank you for partaking in this conversation. Can you explain what you mean "that's your opinion" do you think that because you can purchase one item with another they "back" each other? Whats your opinion?
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:00:07
30 is one tenth of 300. I was saying that even if the miners shrink by 9/10 the network would still be stable enough
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:43:34
But its not really a problem.. even if we only had a 10th of the power of the network it would still be very secure and at that rate it would be profitable to mine at even as low as $30 a bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-01-18 20:47:23
The problem is if people don't buy the newly mined gold the miners will need to put there operations on hold and less will be mined, but if people stop buying bitcoin and miners aren't making a profit some will stop but the same amount of btc will be mined
@_date: 2015-01-19 05:33:18
Let me rephrase that: a bitcoin is not intrinsically redeemable for a certain amount of electricity, It may have value and that value can be redeemed for gold, silver or any other commodity but that doesnt mean its backed by them
@_date: 2015-01-14 23:50:10
It doesn't really matter how much profit gold/btc miners are making what matters is how much money is being pouring in from outside
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:51:10
But there is nothing stopping them from creating 10x the current fiat in circulation causing each dollar to be worth 10 cents. So its just a matter of trusting the federal reserve with all your economic energy you've ever stored up
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:58:20
True but if it was cheaper to buy them off the exchange than it was to mine wouldn't they speculate that way? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 20:43:03
After hyperinflation of the USD it'll be worth 0.0012 BTC
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:46:53
In the long run the supply reduces but I think its healthy for such a young currency to have a healthy supply lowering the prices allowing more of the general public to get in on the ground level. If everyone feels like they missed the boat they wont really buy too many btc but if people feel like they're getting in on the ground level and have a chance of having steak in the game it could get broader adoption.
@_date: 2015-01-19 19:20:07

True and thats why its a good response to "whats bitcoin backed by"
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:23:37
It says "In another sense, because they are legal tender, Federal Reserve notes are "backed" by all the goods and services in the economy." And there are many people that believe this lie and think the USD is backed by the nations GDP. In reality its only backed by our imaginations, as soon as we wake up and realize that they're essentially worthless and we are being robbed by those who can just create them out of thin air they'll lose all there value and wont by anything.
@_date: 2015-01-19 08:56:22
They must've really been making a killing when the price was higher and even now it must still be worth it for everyone mining. Maybe the miners are trying to discourage others from starting to mine taking away from there profitability 
@_date: 2015-01-19 06:53:10
I was basing my numbers of approximations from bitcoin mining calculators but even if im off by $100 and its really between $200 and $400 the point is the same
@_date: 2015-01-19 07:46:38
Well they would get bought and used as profitability allows thus picking up the overall hashrate thus making it secure again

@_date: 2015-01-19 04:28:52
Although the GDP may strengthen the dollar there really is no guarantee that it'll be redeemable for anything tomorrow. There are no rules in place that determine the amount of inflation based on GDP as a matter of fact the Federal reserve tends to inflate more when the economy is low to "boost" the economy but in reality they are just taking away the value of the dollars in your pocket.

Isn't it: having 51% only means you can double spend your own coins within 10 minutes but once a block is confirmed there's no going back? So they couldnt really hold the whole blockchain hostage they could only double spend their own coins (and only the second transfer will be the valid one leaving the first recipient empty handed)

The fact that there are less total available and still the same price doesn't make it less valuable than gold it means that if theres a influx from cash to btc/gold (lets just say equally, like 2 billion pouring into gold and 2 billion pouring into btc) the btc will rise much faster as there are less units to diffuse the increase in price

Why do ppl put so much faith in fiat?
@_date: 2017-01-01 19:13:04

If everything is in a bubble than money is at a discount.

@_date: 2015-02-15 03:18:32
Pretty impressive. Thanks for the detailed response 
@_date: 2015-02-13 22:52:28
Why would people keep funding that silly thing. why dont we get together and fund something more sophisticated looking
@_date: 2015-02-22 07:02:14
No the opposite. If less people can purchase there's less demand.
@_date: 2017-06-25 19:05:28
Only if you're sending them to your coinbase account.. It's an off ledger transfer, of course it's instant and free 
@_date: 2013-12-31 02:09:24
so in short: near the end of 2011 and the beginning of 2012 people all of a sudden switched from transacting around 100 bitcoins per transactions to around 1mbtc.
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:34:11
sell your gold and buy bitcoin? or do the opposite of what everyone else is doing and buy gold while its low with your high bitcoins?
@_date: 2013-12-31 01:38:10
What am I looking at?
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:32:41
ppl spend worthless fiat because there is no value in saving it. ppl who own gold dont trade it in to get the latest iphone every six months
@_date: 2017-06-08 20:27:53
Your right that eventually manipulation ends but they've been doing it to silver for decades! Cryptos are harder as you cant produce more paper assets than what actually exists but it is still possible to artificially hold the price down for some time
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:53:58
even with access they need immediate purchasing power not a way to store their economic growth
@_date: 2017-06-16 05:07:23
Raising target interest rate from 1 to 1.25 percent. Price inflation isn't high enough. Must mine more usd to devalue the dollar to the goal of 2 percent inflation. As we continue to prosper as a country we must ensure price stability by inflating the dollar less the items become too cheap. (that's what I heard the first 15min)
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:14:37
terrible title

I ment when the rewards stop completely. i.e once all the bitcoins are mined. 
Either the big miners will charge exorbitant fees or leave for another crypto currency leaving the system vulnerable to a 51% hack
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:44:53
Convert to cash and give it to them until local food stores accept it. They dont need a store of value they need food.
@_date: 2013-12-26 11:11:42
Hopefully the public users won't allow it by not sending high transaction fees but as more and more mainstream users are added they'll just do whatever their app tells them to do and who's going to own and update the major apps? 
@_date: 2013-12-24 20:35:57
contact coinbase immediately 
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:39:27
It cost money to get money out of mtgox
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:40:48
they'll give you promissory notes for bitcoin that you can come collect in 5 years from now like they do for gold
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:51:55
It depends on how many people start using it. If right now 10 percent of the eventual bitcoiners are using it it'll grow to 7470. The more ppl invest in it the more it's worth. 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:34:20
there are more people looking to buy then sell so try localbitcoin exchange and sell them a little over market price 
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:28:14
I dont see an option for BTC/USD.
Do you have to switch to SLL in between?
@_date: 2013-12-29 05:45:44
Problem is most of what people buy is crap they don't need, saving more would put the economy into a depression. 
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:25:36
I think this is how most ppl think of Bitcoin
@_date: 2013-12-26 09:59:11
then you have to pay the exchange rate 3 times. What's the total percentage?
@_date: 2013-12-26 10:44:52
Even so it's becoming unprofitable to mine with 25btc reward. Even with a large amount of transactions per block I can see how there not going to mine it without a 2 percent fee. 
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:10:32
your fiat
@_date: 2013-12-27 08:38:12
Try it and let us know what happens 
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:27:58
so its 100 million bits per bitcoin?
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:51:56
If Iran agrees to accept bitcoins for oil the USA will go to war over "weapons of mass destruction" to fight for the US Dollar like they did in Iraq 
@_date: 2013-12-31 00:26:57
oh thats where I left them!
@_date: 2013-12-29 06:11:39
when people dont buy and everyone saves the economy collapses like what happened buy the great depression
@_date: 2013-12-30 08:09:24
Dogecoin will be around way after Bitcoin is a long forgotten memory :-)
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:10:02
It's possible the market owners are still playing price manipulation 
@_date: 2013-12-26 20:22:05
But with a corrupt government sheering the profits of the working class giving it to the big banks through inflation there is no other choice. Either gold or bitcoin will have the advantage of the middle class who supports the entire economy will get to keep their economic growth. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 05:00:11
Whos to say that after the 25 bitcoin per 10 min reward stops the miners won't gang up against the public and refuse to add transactions to the blockchain without a Western Union like fee?
Even now if you use bitcoin-qt they'll force a fee on you for some transactions
@_date: 2013-12-30 21:12:05
Reddit should move to this platform 
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:42:45
Don't do it even if you can. It'll consume you.
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:18:46
Wow! looks even cheaper than coinbase!
@_date: 2013-12-26 21:07:37
explain why you think so or go away
