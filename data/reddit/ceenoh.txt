What do you mean BSV is the only scalable and usable Technology??? You are fanboy‘ing so hard you close your eyes for the real big players in blockchain.

This retard claimed in december 2018 that he knows about a security issue in the btc blockchain and is going to abuse this to destroy btc in early 2019. 
He is a lying piece of shit begging for attention.

Again all you can think of is BTC vs BSV. For some reason you believe iam a BTC maximalist and comparing your glorious BSV to BTC is making it „THE ONLY SCALABLE AND USESABLE TECHNOLOGY „
You are just so ignorant its fking sad! Your Research abilities are shit if you can’t even see the best digital asset ever created that is right in front of you and already being used in the real world.

2 reasons:
1. everything is tied to bitcoin.
2. whales have so much money they need to spread it over the whole market. Otherwise they can’t sell and buy as much.
Happens pretty much in the stock market too. Probably everything is controlled by bots

He is right? How can you support this dumb comment? 
Looks like you have closed eyes too. You compared BSV to BTC and your conclusion is that BSV is the only scalable and useable Technology. You realize that there are thousands of other projects? Do your Research before you claim BS that make you Look like dog shit!

Yeah probably the same shit. They photoshop pictures so you think they have been right in the past. I was talking about that screenshot from a forum post with that anime picture as profile pic.
