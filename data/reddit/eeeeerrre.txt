Personally to me this means nothing.  Without researching it I assume enough food to live and access to clean water are also human rights.  And so far that still isnt going so well for a lot of people.

I suggest finding a better way to advertise this.  In two days a most no one will read this ever.  
But i compliment you in using bitcoins

as it seems to be down right now i cant check.  What methods of payout/funding do they offer?

isnt this true for any currency?  Everyone talks about how anonymous bitcoin is, but people have been passing money around secretively since it was invented.  Political parties do this every day. Bitcoin might just make it easier.

Mail gets lost/stolen.  People have enough to worry about when getting their drugs without having to add hoping the money gets there into the situation.
Plus its illegal, here at least.  Maybe not something a lot of people ordering drugs would be too concerned with..

A lot of countries, allow you to use the internet.  A lot of countries don;t allow you to legally view child porn on the internet.  Couldn't bitcoins be placed in that same subsection?  Unless your interpretation is that access to internet includes everything on the internet.  But in that case many countries would just say no.
