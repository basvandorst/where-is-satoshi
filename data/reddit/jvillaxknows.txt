I feel like it would be healthy to just keep cashing out your profits and leave in what u started. That way u keep getting fed and if u lose, it's just what u started.

Do u keep any balance on coinbase or do u transfer it all onto your hardware wallet?
I've read about hot and cold wallets; I just don't have the volume yet to have both.

I'll give this a try.

Unfortunately their lines don't open until Monday, and I've read on forums they have one of the worst customer support responses thru email.

Thanks for the feedback. I was imagining a major delay such as what's going on with all these unconfirmed transactions and losing out on the actual price I want to sell at.

I mean if u bought 1 btc when it was 5k, and it's been around 15k, u earned 10k. U pull 10k out, pay off car balance or something important, its worth it. Then wait for another profit.
It's safe and u make less "potential" earnings. But u reached a milestone in finances ( paying car off as example). No one can predict the future so no one knows if they will make 5 or 6 figures or lose it all.

That's true. I only have 2 cars to pay off, other than my house I'll be debt free. No car payments would be super nice.
I've been looking at dollar cost average for investing too which looks smart rather than trying to time the buy low opportunities

Would it be free to move 10k from my coinbase to my gdax, then sending the 10k to someone else's coinbase?

How u get verified on bitstamp living in hawaii?

It happened as soon as I made an account on gdax. I knew coinbase ran gdax but I didn't know u would use the same login. So I created a new account using the same login as coinbase. Then suddenly my account was locked/closed.
