Real time was a poor choice of words....
I don't know, maybe the exchanges have to settle their daily balances at "market close" through an escrow based holding fund.
Until the market closes you are only holding virtual paper, at close the escrow transactions are processed, there by providing a public balance sheet of the daily trades and final balances ??
I don't really know how to implement it but the need to have *some* sort of independent auditing of balances is present.

This is interesting and I enjoyed the thought exercise.
I'd absolute put it into the plausible category, also considering the history of technology and how it's benefited western society in general and specifically the US.
I've been speculating that BITCOIN is just proof of concept for national currencies switching from print fiat to crypto currency fiat.
When it comes down to it, why wouldn't a nation switch their currency instead of continuing to print money. You get a payment network on top of a currency. Incentivising your population to provide hashing power wouldn't that difficult.
I like the analyst, cheers!

m-of-n and blind signatures.
Funds being held in escrow and transferred directly between parties when a trade is executed...stuff like that is going to be the competitive edge going forward.

Regulate the choke points and limit what it can be used for.
Canada is already one of the most favorable countries towards Bitcoin, if your company uses WagePoint then you can be paid in BTC.
Regulations are needed, think of them more as official "best practices" and if a company doesn't follow them you will have legal recourse.
BITCOIN need regulations so there is clarity on how to own it, buy it, and use it.

I guess that is my point, while I understand the concern this is something that should already have an established 'best practice' within the existing forex industry.

Hitler analogy....really?? Are you brand new to the internet.
You've automatically lose when you reference Hitler....plus it's a *really* bad analogy as hilter *did* order those people killed. Ross did not order anyone to use the site or take drugs, he facilitated the transactions and took a rip.
You can object to it morally and ethically (I do) but the business model was solid and the execution was pretty slick.

The question was why would *someone* donate to his defense, which I provided.
Personally I agree with you, he is a big boy and knew what he was doing.
If he didn't stash away a legal fund that is stupid and not my problem.
If there was a chance it would influence policy I might donate but I don't really think it will based on the charges.
He got power mad and became corrupt for that, can't be helped under the current legal framework and it really just another reason to push for responsible adults being responsible and legalize the commodities similar to alcohol and tobacco.
But you asked why people might donate, not if I would or not.
I do admire his balls and gusto and if had stuck to the market place only he would have been fine and could have transitioned out cleanly.
Pity, it was kind of epic in it's own right. 
Plus proof of concept, that's worth something ;)

Ummm every exchange is going that way, cavirtex just launched LTC/CAD and BTC/LTC.
I use both and VoS is a nice site AND cheaper than cavirtex (1.5% fee)
I sent $750 to both exchanges and bought on the way down on both.
Cavirtex final: 1.072BTC
VoS: 1.064BTC
VoS volume is lower and my buys there on average we a little higher, the fee difference almost made up for it.
It's a nice site, only complaint is you have to use a spreadsheet to figure out your buys, cavirtex you can drop and 2 of variables and it will do the math for you.
I recommend them, it's a nice site and the service is good.
Volume is picking up, USD more than CAD

How do other exchanges do it, ie the larger non BTC ones?
I think I understand the concern here and this appears to be a "best practices" argument and the concern is that by not following it, customer funds could be frozen along with company assets.
How how is it supposed to be implemented? 1 FIAT account per client and a middle level clearing account?

Thank you Bruce, you've been a class act through out this whole drama.
My assessment, previously and now as well, matches yours and is why I risked some BTC buying up GoxDebt.
It's gone from a Hail Mary pass to act of God chance of getting those coins back.
I also believe that Mark still feels that the the coins will be returned and with them the FIAT liabilities can be covered.
That is probably wishful thinking on his part and I doubt it will happen, that being said it should be noted that he *hasn't* capitulated at this time...not sure what that says but it is something.
I'm beginning to start to think we are watching some weird Mexican standoff, where hackers, tx malleability, custom bitcoind software and a propriety cold storage system all have a part in this drama.

It's not a zero sum game like you are trying to make it out.
He, like many other people, will start to *split* their traffic between sites and eventual one of the sites will be the bulk and the other will get a trickle.
Digg is still alive you know that right? When people migrated off it they didn't just STOP and never went back, it's a gradual changing of behaviours and takes about 3 months before you change them completely.
I know you've grown up on video games giving you instant achievements but this doesn't apply to real life. It's a much slower transition.

the original reddit code is open source, the current code base it runs on is not and hasn't been for a long time.
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:32:17
casual user and I did notice it as I described it, the exodus was happening and the content dried up and I moved to reddit.
But like the 85% of the user base Pao is referencing I didn't care about the drama or anything else, I just came for the curated internet links and when that went away, so did I.
Same shit is happening with reddit, you do know that reddit was a piece of shit when people moved over? The siutations are very similar, same disconnected management trying to monetize and just alienates that entire user base that provides the value of their site.
Digg is still around, it obvious gets enough traffic and revenue to stay alive.
Reddit is no longer the new big thing, it's the incumbent and if it continues the way it's going, within 2 years you won't even recognize the site.
It needs new leadership, that understands the user base and will involve them in the monetization process, asap or it's just going to die.

voat seems more like a refactoring of reddits code than a rip-off.
That being said, the devs also used it for learning the framework and that usually doesn't produce great code.
Time will tell, it has potential but I don't think they had a plan in place if this happen.

They are scrambling to get resources in place, for sure but how the fuck would they know reddit was going to explode a couple days ago.
They really do need to get ontop of the hardware asap or they will miss the traffic boat.
IMO they need a strong sysadmin over there to help them get shit together and have a plan in place for the next wave of reddit drama.
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:34:36
to my understanding Digg is profitable now.... not that I ever go there other than to see if it still exists.
Same with Slashdot and the other older media sites that have gotten bought up. They are also places that the majority of redditors don't send traffic to anymore.
You're point doesn't make any sense as you are comparing two companies at different growth stages. Voat is just reddit when reddit was the little guy against digg.
It's the same situation.
@_date: 2015-07-05 12:26:31


and you don't seem to understand the inputs that cause it. Do you remember Digg, where you around for that? I was on digg while it was happening as a casual user.
I had no fucking clue what was going on and didn't care but what did happen is all the people that made Digg worthwhile to go to, left and then I noticed that the content had gone to shit and I moved on...to reddit.
I found the Digg vs REddit war comic way later, it was years after the fact that I finally learn what happened.
This is happening to reddit right now, the content providers are trickling away and within a few years reddit, as long as someone is providing an alternative, will go the way of Digg.
It's clear that is Pao's direction as well, to montenize reddit and sell it and walk away.
and THAT is what the community is reacting to, the leadership clearly just wants to make a buck of the site and they feel entitled to it, that we are just peons that rule over.
Voat will take all the traffic if they make a better site and that has yet to be seen.
@_date: 2015-07-05 13:37:11

it's not the same code that is run in production if they have extra pieces that are not in the repo.

People aren't leaving Reddit because if FPH and your an idiot if you think its over that.
It hasbt happened yet, it's at the same point Digg was at before they started telling the users what the changes are going to be.
I'll bet you dollars to donuts its going be the same crap.

Abstract:      
Just as decentralization communication systems lead to the creation of the Internet, today a new technology — the blockchain — has the potential to decentralize the way we store data and manage information, potentially leading to a reduced role for one of the most important regulatory actors in our society: the middleman. 
Blockchain technology enables the creation of decentralized currencies, self-executing digital contracts (smart contracts) and intelligent assets that can be controlled over the Internet (smart property). The blockchain also enables the development of new governance systems with more democratic or participatory decision-making, and decentralized (autonomous) organizations that can operate over a network of computers without any human intervention. These applications have lead many to compare the blockchain to the Internet, with accompanying predictions that this technology will shift the balance of power away from centralized authorities in the field of communications, business, and even politics or law.
In this Article, we explore the benefits and drawbacks of this emerging decentralized technology and argue that its widespread deployment will lead to expansion of a new subset of law, which we term Lex Cryptographia: rules administered through self-executing smart contracts and decentralized (autonomous) organizations. As blockchain technology becomes widely adopted, centralized authorities, such as governmental agencies and large multinational corporations, could lose the ability to control and shape the activities of disparate people through existing means. As a result, there will be an increasing need to focus on how to regulate blockchain technology and how to shape the creation and deployment of these emerging decentralized organizations in ways that have yet to be explored under current legal theory.

BARTENDER: No I don't have any grapes...this is a bar!!
DUCK: Ok then.... And he waddles away
Very next day the Duck comes in and asks "have any grapes?"
BARTENDER: "NO! I don't have any grapes, I swear I will nail your feet to the bar!"
DUCK: ok...ok.....take it easy buddy....
And waddled on out.
Next day duck waddled into that bar and asks "hey bartender! Have any nails?"
Bartender looks confused "uhhh No"
Duck then replies "Good! Got any grapes?"

it seems to be the best thing overall, i've been following bitcoin for a bit but I didn't realize how much it's taken off. 
I've been waiting for the bottom to hit (which my gut is telling me in between $40-$60 based on the number of people that *actually* believe it in) to start getting bit coins (I've amassed so far .05 from blockchain and some faucets, I have mined an addition .05 and will continue to do that until I can start making a better return a different way).
Seems like the best plan over the long haul is to ride the bubbles up, flipping fiat for bitcoin until before it pops, or after doesn't really matter if you are holding bitcoin for the long run.
I know it's funny but the *most* reassuring thing I have seen towards bitcoins is MetArt, and porn in general, start accepting it.

I'd say 400 years give or take.... We haven't had a currency event like this since the switch from coins to paper notes.
Interesting times ;)

Watching, it's all I do since it crashed.
my gut told me the bottom was between $40-$60 and after that it would only go up. I've amassed a total of 0.06 by mining and buy off blockchain.
Started explaining it friends/family a little while ago, once they understand the SR mean commence is going on with bitcoin as the currency, it seems to reassure people that it is *infact* a currency more than a commodity.
but I'm fucking broke...A HORSE, MY KINGDOM FOR A HORSE!!!
So I totally feel like that dude. I'm not too worried though, I've been onto bitcoin before (and have facebook post to back it up) and I plan on transferring my 'investments' (which is a trickle of income) into bitcoin.
Try and ride the next bubble up, sell before it crashes and then turn around and get more coins...rinse and repeat until distributed exchanges come online and the price stabilizes out. 
Which will probably be over a period of years..right now I'm just kicking myself for not taking the easy money!
I''l take tips..shamelessly! 18wiub91hy7o5AJpeUtMAv94bh14cbq1MJ

He would have been smart to spend the money to hire someone to build him mining machines using FPGA.
Dammit, I need money :)
