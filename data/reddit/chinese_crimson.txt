why do you buy now? you dont buy when it dips, you never do unless you are absolutely certain it will go up and soon. bitcoin might or might not go up again but either way this is not when you buy.  give me ur money instead at least i will buy dinner with it

If you believe it will go up in some years then you can wait weeks or months now to buy once it stabilizes to minimize the risk and maximize the profit. It's 15% down from yesterday isn't it?         Otherwise you are taking unnecessary risk. If it's so volatile and yet you can't wait a week then i invite you to a blackjack table, better returns, similar risk, and no knowledge required. No reason to buy now. Even if it does go up to 10k and stays there, I believe it's better to lose 2k being smart than to lose 2k being impatient if it goes down to 6k

no, its still high risk because its volatile. volatile equals high risk, doesnt matter if its cheaper, thats not what low risk high reward means. And you shouldnt buy when it dips just because it dips if you arent sure it will go up AND SOON. If you believe it will go up in X years then you wait weeks or months to buy once it stabilizes to minimize the risk and maximize the profit. Using your "strategy", how many people bought at 10k or 12k or 14k because "IT DIPPED, BUY AND HODL"? they could be lucky but that just makes them lucky idiots. It's absolutely dumb to buy now
