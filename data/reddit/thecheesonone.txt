What kind of controls are we taking about, could I not transfer the money to a kraken wallet for example?

What alternative would you recommend?

Bit of a newbie here, what's supposed to happen on Jan1 that'll make it a bloodbath?

I'm not sure, possible withdrawing to an account or transferring the money to a kraken account and withdrawing from there, I'm just curious what controls could be in place to stop the withdrawal

I already factored that charge into account, the actual amount payed was £500 but only £490.50 went through but even less than this was exchanged?

I've noticed it being unreliable, I'd like to find an exchange with low fees yet still with the charting and functionality of kraken with a mobile app, do you know which of these exchanges fill those criteria?
Thanks for your help!

Thank you for your reply, what kind of restrictions are we talking about, I only have 0.01 btc and am looking to break even as that was my trial investment, it seems like I could break even easily using their exchange and then return the kraken for actual investing.
I understand the risk and that's what's holding me back, they've been featured in a couple of articles which is the only reason I'm even considering it?

Ahhh thank you so much, I don't think I'll be making that trip so you've really helped me here!
Maybe I'll contact that Nigerian prince that emailed me and see if he can withdraw the funds for me!
