I wouldn't be so confident about the 4k. You see, "greed" is a strong driving force and BTC has shown several times, that after a dump it rises exceptionally.
It is this greed, which will keep people buying btc again, as soon, as it seems to recover.
The same greed makes people buy shitcoins, pay into the most idiotic ponzis and so on.
Never underestimate greed

If the prize goes crazy high, that would mean there is a lot of demand for BTC purchasing with less supply from people selling.
Population is growing, bitcoin will not grow anymore at some point in time - limited supply. population is not really limited (beside space on planet or food). Therefore, if everyone wants (or needs) BTC the price can only go up, so every human can have a part of it. That means, the fiat value of BTC goes up - but the goods you would purchase with that would go up in prize as well (talking about inflation)

batteries: very expensive, very limited lifetime, problematic residual materials.
in grand scale there are much better solutions to store energy (pump storage power plant for example) - but those are not suitable for individuals or miners.
Delivering variing demand of power throughout 24h is a challenge almost noone managed yet (some smaller islands did) - germany for example has to pay(!) france (from time to time) so they are taking the (local) overproduction, when they are producing too much "green" energy but having to use coal/others to produce energy when alternatives just don't work. Customers are paying those costs, that's one reason why electricity in germany is very expensive.
All that "green" is cool on paper, but in reality it's a massive waste of ressources at the moment. who cares, as long as greenpeace is happy

If you get your salary in BTC, than BTC is not longer harder to aquire than fiat (for you), that changes things slightly.
"considering" is meaningless in tax purposes. Can you actually pay your tax in Yen or Euro in USA? Just curious. Would technically be the same thing, because it's just a substitute which will be exchanged to fiat anyway.

In reality, they can't pay taxes in bitcoin - because someone in the (very long queue) of payment receivers has to have to exchange it into something which is accepted all the way. So you can't really blame them.
Would I purchase a house in BTC when I have the same amout in fiat? No. Why? Because BTC is still some sort of asset and "harder" to aquire than fiat, hence, value of holded BTC is way higher than holded fiat (which just loses value). Even a house has most likely less potential in rise in value than BTC has

I would actually think about it differently:
If some farm is aquiring too much hashing power (and therefore control for the network), more miners have to start in order to prevent that farm from gaining too much control.
So actually, that farm is wasting the energy (by forcing other miners to secure the network) - not the other miners who keep BTC safe
it's not a perfect system - mainly because a block reward halfing will hurt the small miners more than the big ones

what such companies collect is nothing different as when the owner of a bakery looks what males and females prefer each. He could say: "well from observation I know, that males with a blue/black/gray uniform have a tendency to like donuts" - there is no private data involved.
But I know what you mean - there may be breaches, but that's why we have laws for that (or should have) - the latest laws in EU does not help very much, because they focus on the wrong thing, was an economical disaster, complicated many things and had no real benefit for anyone involved (except webdesigners and lawyers)

it's a shady situation for both sides.
* why would one sell BTC for cash instead of exchange

In my thinkings it can only lure scammers - on the other side, selling BtC to those who have only dirty money, can't work otherwise .. but than again: you're trading with shady parties :-)
In spain for example (especially barcelona) you have to be cautious all the time, because that city is full of scammers - because there are lots of tourists and ppl just transiting, which is easy prey for them

you are comparing the wrong things. Since weapons are illegal in europe the rate of murder is far less, because violent crimes do not end up in death that often. I agree this is a good thing to not hand weapons to idiots.
We also pay lots of money for a more or less working social system, so the rate of people who have nothing to loose is much lower as well.
Personally I like to point you to this link: 
where you can see that the rate of actual crime (per1000) is actually double than US, even with 25% higher police rate than the US. I may also throw in, that the rate of violent crimes were higher in germany then the US 20 yrs ago and this was when weapons were already illegal in ger. So, how's that?
again, I am not strictly pro-gun just because there are too many idiots out there, which simply should not have a gun. People kill, not guns.

there is a lack of studies to prove, if there were more or less robberies if weapons are legal or not.
my argument is from observation, that we do well know, that the pure possibility of a treat can hold people from taking the risk. It's a psychological fact.
Another fact is, that some people may just not care, they may think, they are superman or they are just too stupid to recognize any risk and do it anyway - or they just have nothing to loose
I never said, that it will stop all robbery. I am also not strictly pro-guns because there are too many idiots in this world not adult enough to be handed a gun - but on the other side I do understand the arguments of people who wants to carry a gun - be it only to feel more safe. A weak woman with a gun is potentially equally dangerous like a much stronger man with a gun (the odds are balanced) - you cannot deny that.

BTCs price is low because too many people are selling it too cheap.
other way round, if more people would want BTC the price would go up, because the cheap coins will be sold out fast, and there would only be the expensive ones left.
I can opt to sell 1 btc at an exchange for 10k .. nobody would buy it, because others are selling 1 BTC for just 7k - if those cheaper ones are gone, someone has to buy my coin if he wants the bitcoin
so basically:
* more ppl HODL = less supply = higher price
* more ppl trading/using/exchanging = more supply = lower price
it's all about supply &amp; demand only - except, someone with high ammounts of supply can play with the demand

you can get guns in germany as well - and it's not that hard actually. An 18 yr old wannabe gangster may not go to wallmart to buy a legal gun, register it and walk into the next drug store to rob the owner with it.
So it would be basically crucial to prevent the "wrong" people to have guns - but that is impossible anyway, because the wrong people will get guns anyway if they want some, no matter where.
Both parties in the gun/nogun debatte have their arguments. Some good, some bad. But you cannot really say that one side is strictly right.

fiat is more versatile atm (may differ on country). The value of fiat is not really stable, people just don't recognize it, they tend to blame someone else when bread is going to cost more money, they don't even realize that's just the money what lost value.
anyway. I agree, that HODLing will prevent circulation of BTC and circulation (and distribution) is the key to adaption of btc as a worldwide currency.
But we are far away from the real value of BTC it's still in price-finding phase and that needs to settle. Don't expect that too soon. The Lightning network is a big step in the right direction
There will come the day when using BTC is more viable than using fiat, it's not there yet

You could argue, if people found some way to create gold, FIATs value would be zero as well. But it won't. Because people don't care. A bottle of milk as an distinct exchange value and currency is just the bit inbetween to exchange milk for - lets say - bread

how many serious traders out there to be willed to pay for it. A million? What does the SpaceX cost? billions? trillions? so everyone of those 1 million traders is willed to pay - say - 1000 usd per month? I don't think so. Something like this needs to be aimed to the masses with a reasonable price.
A trader will be perfectly fine with fiber, yet he is location locked, so that may be a point, but it's still satellites, which speed can be influenced by bad weather conditions - a trader don't want his money depend on weather condition
I don't say it can't be done, I just say, I don't know if it is economically feasible at the very moment of technology. Because it seems SpaceX will not have geo-stationary sats, they NEED to have the full amount of sats in order to function (like GPS) .. I actually wonder, why they don't combine something like GPS with it, which has merely the same requirements

wealthy people don't need bitcoin to avoid taxes .. they have much better possibilities. tax evasion is getting easier, the more money you have. It's pretty easy actually.

Paying some amount of money frequently for governmental things and stuff is one thing. Vehicle Tax = roads for example. no problem with that, it's basically paying for services and that's fine. My opinion is not to pay no taxes at all.
but taxing the same thing over and over again is simply theft. taxing the exchange of wealth = theft
VAT in combination with income tax is basically a system which gathers infinite % of all circulating money over time:
barber gets paid 10$ for haircut (collecting vat -2$), barber pays income tax (-1.60$). baber has 6.40$ left. barber buys food ad backery for 6.40$, backery collects vat (-1.28), backery pays income tax (-1.02), backer has 4.10. now backer goes to the barber for a cheap haircut of 4.10 .. .. you see what I am doing here? tax collected already &gt;50% of the initial 10usd

Providing Housing &amp; Food is actually a better idea than just giving them free money.
Well, but you need to think further. If any city now decides to provide more housing and food, that **could** lead to an inrush of homeless ppl from other cities (like refugee happenings in germany)

Personally I don't think that giving away free money (it wouldn't be a lot anyway) would change something considerably, because the overhead for organisation will eat up the most of it anyway

Asset price is not solely based on technical parameters. so every deep learning algorithm will miss important parts of the equation, thus not being a feasable source of prediction.
Example: It's actually interesting how ppl believe in fibonacci, when the only reason of this pattern is, because ppl believe in it (self fulfilling prophecy), so the accuracy of fibonacci relies on the simple fact of how many fibonacci-traders are currently active

argument? He is billionaire, he has lots of money - yet he says **others** should pay for the homeless.
Honestly, he talks about equality, but is not willed to set himself equal to the average by giving away all his money. Which is absolutely fine for me, but then he should not sit there and talk how others should pay

Do not mix the facts. Back then Laika Bank was shut down and in the process all uninsured funds (everything above 100k eur), and ~50% of all uninsured funds of BankOfCyprus - to pay off an immense loan from russia. So the rich actually lost the most and not just 10% - depending on which bank they were on.
But still - **that incident shows EXACTLY why you want to have your wealth in crypto and not at banks. Crypto changes the world in that manner because it set's you free from political incompetence completely.**

They don't, they think the country has just loads of money. They are conditioned to that and on't even think about why the hell do we not pay less taxes, when the country has too many any way.
I could bring an example from germany, but I think people will dislike it

Well, then organize a poll with the following options:
* use 20bill of tax money to give free cash to the poorest
* reduce the tax by the same amount
(in case there is a 20bil overage in budget)
now guess what people would vote. welcome to democracy, unfortunately, polls are not made in the honest way like above

so because they earn more, they should pay more - but do they get more service? No. That's how you force high tax payers to leave the country. you don't want that. Because they will take the jobs with them (other subject)
Unfortunately I am not that aware of how america handles unemployment, I can just talk about the european system, which is extremely expensive and there are still homeless.

technically yes, when the server is compromised and the phishing site is actually delivered from the original webserver - however, normally such servers should be highly secured.
Your best bet is just common sense - if something asks for sensible information like a seed - recheck why this is (google it), ask support, public places (like reddit) etc. That way a hack can be discovered early.

The less people have bitcoin the lower the value will be. So the wales need to spend their coins in order to keep their value.
Some day in the future we will get rid of the current tax system and switch over to a fixed per head tax, basically getting rid of accouting and tax optimization all together, that's when economy will go to the moon - but most of us will not live long enough to experience it

maybe ask them which Bank they were in, if they were at Laika (Cyprus Popular Bank) they lost 100% over 100k and that 100k were transfered to BoC, because Laika was shut down

what's the benefit of equality? (honest question)
I mean that "free cash" would actually be taxpayers money. So the taxpayer would want a reason, why he should pay, so others get free cash. at the end the taxpayer should pay taxes to get some sort of service, so what would be the service in that case
@_date: 2018-04-27 10:15:53
why compare with a bank ..?

you miss the point that money in my account is "virtual" it's a representation of value, the bank owes me basically, that's why I get interest on my account holdings. Where do you think that interest comes from?

fyi: In spain you have to report any wealth or obsessions outside of the country so the gov knows about it for taxing purposes (even if its not subject to local taxes)
I am pretty sure we will see similar laws where you have to report every cryptoaddress you own.

People read "shall we give free money to the poor" they will say "yes"
but if we confront them to the problem that this money have to come from somewhere and we could also use it for something else, than things changes radically. Using the shortsightness of people to influence a poll result is not democratic (and I know this is done all the time)

I am actually basing on physics like the speed of light and wireless being influenced by atmospheric issues ..

the same way, you would do with fiat money.
you have a contract and/or have some sort of escrow. a lawyer may help you with that, you don't need gov
you only need gov to pay taxes for the house. the same taxes the prior buyer paid as well an d the prior buyer paid as well ... (funny enough, there may be more taxes paid already than the house is actually worth)

@_date: 2018-07-03 20:25:15


that's why I am not a friend of giving someone free money.
Still - he wants that america should hand out free cash. That free cash comes from taxpayers. Most taxpayers are not billionaires. Most taxpayersa re more equal to the poor than the billionaire is.


Why give it away? Why not built homes for the homeless? Why not found charity institutions who collect money and distribute it to those who need it? There is a multitude of possibilities he could do.
My main point is just, he talks about equality, but he still wakes up with billions on his account every day. How is that equal? I don't have a problem with him being a billionaire and keep his money, but it's far away from equality and demands **others** shall (be forced) to pay. That's not right. He could easily buy someone a small house every month from interest alone (and put a miner in it as compensation)
@_date: 2018-04-16 14:04:28
but how - somehow they still need to have a network somewhere to maintain the blockchain. To not maintain that network themselves, they'd need to give away an incentive for others to do it.
I imagine that updating/extending functionality in a blockchain driven system would be by far more complicated than just update server-code and have the clients still function.
I guess, they want every seaport to run a node of their blockchain maybe?
@_date: 2018-04-16 10:53:38
why are companies considering blockchain technology? They don't need decentralization, databases are cheaper and faster and more versatile .. they don't need distributed consensus, they will clearly want a secured central point of consens for things like shipment logistics and customer/invoice/etc data
Maybe I miss something?

I don't want to promote in a scientific degree - pure logic tells me, that if I get interest on my account holdings, that interest has to come from somewhere - which is bascially: the bank gives credits by using my money, where the bank basically owes me the amount of my holdings

you expect, governments being smart, but they aren't. It's a bunch of dump politicians with not much of an idea. They just see it as an asset which should be taxed and hire some professionals to do the paperwork (which is ok)
but do not expect them (or most of them) to understand what crypto actually is. So the reason they don't fight them is because they have no idea yet. They will start to go crazy when they find out that many ppl use it because they will get paranoia about tax evasion
@_date: 2018-07-25 09:44:29
they lie because they to desperatly push the value to finally get rid of the basically free money introduced by BCH.
Why didn't they start a new blockchain? Why did they use the word "bitcoin"? Because it's scam
@_date: 2018-07-29 10:15:52
true - thanks to crypto, we don't need banks any more. drawback: if noone deposits money to a bank, the bank cannot give out loans - so we need a different loaning system based on crypto I guess.

Not really. You set up a contract about the purchase, every party fills in their address (or whatever is going to be traded) - if contract is fulfilled, it is fulfilled. If you want to keep the seller from running away with your money, you get some lawyer/trustee/escrow whatever who will take the btc but just hands them over when other party has fulfilled the contract.
Fun Fact: If the acutall property register would be a blockchain it would be possible to have a smart contract giving your ownership upon received payment - you wouldn't need any 3rd party at all (gov would be even more irrelevant then)
