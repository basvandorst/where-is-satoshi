I like that bitcoin provides an powerful and easy way to diversify away from fiat and government inflation.  As a digital distributed blockchain, they cannot be seized, so they are a great asset to hedge against a single country’s currency failing.

Inter bank transfers are slow, this isn’t entirely coinbase’s fault.  These transfers are free but take 5 business days (a week), regardless if it’s from Bank of America to Chase or to Wells Fargo or to Coinbase.
You could wire if you needed money faster, it’s just going to be expensive.

Bribed?  You mean paid?  Do I bribe starbucks workers every day to make me coffee?  If you don’t “bribe” them, they don’t do it!  Thieves!

Also -
Bitcoin’s value is in being free from government control and regulation!
(Something goes wrong)
Omg, why won’t the authorities step in?

Paying for services is not corrupt, unless you are Stalin and believe in communism.
Miners pay for expensive hardware and a crazy amount of electricity, and of course they will take the most profitable transactions first.
Think of miners like truck drivers showing up for work.  There’s a huge backlog of shipments and not enough truck drivers.  1.000 trucks  are sitting there, and they all need to go to Chicago.  Each offers a different amount of money for the job - $50, $200, $1,000.  Not surprisingly, as truck drivers arrive, they pick the highest paying one.  
If you stick a truck there, and stick a $10 sign outside the window, yes, it could be weeks, months, or never as no one wants to take that job.
This is capitalism, plain and simple.

In a free market, that’s exactly how it would work.  Inside of starbucks it is different, as the tips don’t pay for the coffee.
A better example would be if you had 10 coffee shops next to each other mc and each one charged a different price of coffee.  Which one would you pick?  The lowest.  The lowest wins because capitalism.
For capitalism to work in your example, the baristas have to be free agents, not working 100% for starbucks.  If you had something like a “Coffee Day fair” and girls walking around serving coffee, yes I totally expect that they should got to the people waving the biggest tips.

That’s bitcoin right now.  It’s $30-$50 to move any transaction, regardless if you are moving $100,000 or trying to buy $5 beer.

Yes did you also imagine the girls to in Hooter style uniforms walking around with trays of coffee?  That was what I was picturing, with tips stuffed between their bra.

If they prioritized low transaction fees it wouldn’t solve the backlog issue.
There are 200,000 unconfirmed transactions in the mempool.  Regardless of which transactions miners pick, they can only do 6 transactions a second.  So whether they pick high or low fee, the number they can do is the same.
It’s a simple matter of supply and demand.  Eventually once fewer bitcoin transactions are added, the miners will catch up and reduce the backlog, since their throughput is basically constant (difficulty adjustments ensures that).

What do you mean?  I can move money in and out of GDAX for $0 fee from my bank (Chase).  For US customers it should be zero fee for any bank.

Fees make perfect sense - if there were not any fees, anyone could easily spam attack the system and add 100,000 fake transactions - every day, every hour, until it collapses.
Thanks to fees, spam attacking bitcoin is very expensive - it would cost more than $5 million dollars to spam 100,000 transactions at the current fee, and to keep that up for weeks would be beyond what a simple spammer could afford.

So bitcoin price is falling because Coinbase is being spammed attacked by widthdrawl requests.
Makes sense.
What’s weird is that /bitcoin’s front page yesterday  coordinated its users to move off of Coinbase using gdax.  So the spam attack came from here, causing everyone’s bitcoin price to fall.  Good job.

Assets in general are deflationary - from housing to stocks to land - everything is rising faster than inflation.   Heck even famous paintings are assets that rise in value.  This is why the rich get richer and poor get poorer.

Survivorship bias.  You can’t because you have never heard of them.  Every year hundreds if not thousands of new ideas are created but if you read a history book you will only find 1-2 inventions per year or less.  The other idea just failed and never made it into history.

That’s not really correct.  A pyramid scheme relies on the bottom to actually pay into the top, not merely work for them.  Basically, if you had to pay $10,000 to get your current job, and your boss told you that you don’t get paid, but instead go convince another 10 people to pay $10,000, and you will half of that ($50,000).  This keeps going until it runs out of people on earth to support the scheme, and it falls apart.
