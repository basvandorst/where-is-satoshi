oh my gosh, thank you! quick nooby question, how do I claim this?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:00:42
Sorry what are they? I'm still kind of confused. Can you give me some links or something?
@_date: 2013-11-23 05:01:52
Well, my thinking is, if it takes no effort to make them, even if it's only a short amount, why not?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:18:02
Yea that was my thinking. But I don't know how to get started? I tried joining bitcoin.cz and using rpcminer, but it didn't work so now I don't know what to do.

Is it really that small of an amount? Would it ever be worth it to get one of those machines designed for mining?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:55:17
Okay update. I started it, but it said no serial ports to be found. What does this mean?
@_date: 2013-11-22 22:49:44
Okay I logged in, but when I hit the engine start button, nothing happens? Am I doing something wrong?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:49:56
I figured it out, again thank you so much! :D

If it's any consolation, I'm at college so it won't be my electricity, and we're not charged for anything of that nature. And I won't make anything, even if I'm in a pool?
@_date: 2013-11-23 02:52:03
Sorry, one more update. I got everything working, and my computer is mining at 72 Mhps. How likely am I to make anything off of this and if so, how do I claim it and put it in my wallet?
@_date: 2013-11-23 18:58:55
This sounds like so much more of a viable option. One thing that I didn't quite understand: do I have to make a new wallet and then transfer that later? Or will it just go straight to my wallet? And if you work on Mac as well, can you give me the name of your client, wallet, and pool?
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:35:24
True..darn I wish I invested in Bitcoins when I heard about them years ago...
@_date: 2013-11-22 20:34:50
So this may sound stupid, but what's and OpenID? Isn't there a way to sign up normally?
