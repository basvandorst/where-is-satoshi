Thanks goodness the tx is merely pocket change, right?

This will be the slowest hour of my life.

If the ETF is approved it could spike even higher.  
@_date: 2017-03-10 14:05:06
it's weird to see LBC price below the other exchanges.
@_date: 2017-03-10 16:19:06
I totally agree with this.  The truth this is a giant financial experiment and no one knows if it will survive the test of time.  Whenever I talk to friends/relatives about Bitcoin, I am always sure to include the disclaimer that tomorrow it could be worth nothing and the whole project a wash.  This is paired by unbridled excitement and enthusiasm for BTC though, so don't get me wrong. 
@_date: 2017-03-10 19:26:03
yes at 4:59:59.  lol
@_date: 2017-03-10 13:44:52
I hope you are right!! This is exciting. 
@_date: 2017-01-02 21:35:29
that has to be the most optimistic thing I've ever read.  What a cheery way to look at it. 
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:26:23
Thanks for the positive post.  We need more like this. Via Bitcoin (in whatever form it takes)
@_date: 2016-12-09 18:27:20
Thank you, I appreciate this.

I was just thinking this too. STFU, Forbes.

I can't believe it was only 2 years ago. It seems like much longer.

used to. used to.

cheap for the consumer, not for the vendor. 
@_date: 2017-04-18 12:41:29
these seem like similar conditions to Mt. Gox -- although I would not want to make any conclusions until Bitfinex has a chance to weigh in.  It seems like they are in a pissing match with Wells Fargo so all their other banking cronies are ganging up on them.  I sincerely hope that they can resolve their issues and move forward. 
@_date: 2017-04-19 14:02:42
guilty as charged. I'm looking forward to de-FUDing my head on Finex. :)
@_date: 2017-04-18 13:17:30
I agree on that, and it's just worrisome because fiat deposits were halted (like gox), their having problems with bank wires (like gox) and also the value on BTFX is breaking away from the other exchanges, like gox.  
Not at all implying that they are insolvent -- just the set of events are very similar from what I remember.  I think that they are most likely far more competent than Karpeles.  
@_date: 2016-09-21 16:21:03
come on, BTC killer app!
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:33:29
I don't even want to think about what 46M in a memepool would do!
@_date: 2016-10-19 15:14:37
Newsweek is awful. The headline is misleading and old. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 16:51:27
ahh I see. :) Thanks for clarifying.
@_date: 2016-10-20 17:37:18
oh well in that case, seems legit. 
@_date: 2016-10-26 15:28:54
I wonder if this has to do with the large number of unconfirmed transactions in the memepool.
@_date: 2017-05-12 19:54:35
did this seriously trigger this MF selloff?  
@_date: 2017-05-23 19:26:07
that's how consensus is reached with a HF - the longest chain wins.  I agree ETH/ETC is a great example. Ideally the other chain would be abandoned immediately, though. 
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:43:29
This is true - baby boomers and up are generally not good with computers. Let's not make a larger generalization here than I have already committed, but yes, a lot of them just don't "get it". That means that a large percentage of them will never "get" Bitcoin. Some of them do and learn because they see the potential.  Others are ageist and contemptuous, these are the dumb ones imo. They  are probably the same folks running XP,  all locked up, reading yahoo finance. :P
@_date: 2017-05-15 18:33:49
apples and oranges, my friend.  
@_date: 2017-05-15 15:53:15
it's fairly easy to transact with though, once you wrap your head around the concept.  And most people (general public) have no clue. That is what I interpreted "Using Bitcoin is hard" as; it doesn't say "Obtaining Bitcoin is hard" -- I see your point though.  
@_date: 2017-05-16 12:36:26
This is true - Localbitcoins if you wanted to pay a premium.  Still.. "It's hard!" is a lame excuse. 
@_date: 2017-05-09 12:37:27
I totally agree.  What comes up (may) go down. 
@_date: 2017-05-04 21:02:03
who's panicking?  Looks like some sperm whales just dumped their load.

I forgot what sub I was in for a second. sigh. *an 
@_date: 2017-05-23 16:09:06
 Ethereum.  I don't see Bitcoin on there anymore. :( 
@_date: 2017-07-12 13:02:00
How very bank-ish of you.  Gross. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:28:13
The Internet of Money is a great beginner's read into why Bitcoin is important. Seconded audigex about not hanging out too much in either sub. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:15:53
mmmm corelaid. Keep on sippin'. 
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:30:03
*thinks back to July 2016 when BTC was at $600
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:07:51
what are you afraid of?  :)
@_date: 2017-07-31 20:12:06
spot on.  I think there is a certain level of fear that BCC is in fact superior.  And will take over as the larger chain (height + hash power)
But my question is - if BCC scales and works correctly, and provides a path to the original use case for Bitcoin, can we all just move on and call it Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2017-05-15 14:54:58
it's really not that hard. It's a lot easier than dealing with banks..   People are just fucking dumb. 
@_date: 2017-07-31 13:39:01
I'll be turning my empty buckets of popcorn into tear collectors.  Redemption day is upon us! Let's see which network is better: one with artificial congestion and high fees, or one with no congestion and low fees.  The market will decide.  
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:23:48
Seems like a straightforward statement, and I don't blame him.  It's ridiculous the amount of hate Roger receives in this sub.  And let the largest chain become Bitcoin..... lol at the altcoin doublespeak bullshit that this sub preaches. 
@_date: 2017-07-25 14:24:53
sheep! as far as the eye could see. 
@_date: 2017-07-24 18:46:23
run some CB coin through a mixer or to a DNM, that should close your account for you. ;0

Several exchanges including Poloniex and Kraken are under DDoS attack.

this. 
@_date: 2017-06-16 15:04:59
Good to hear from someone who is willing to compromise.. Bitcoin needs more people open to compromise in order to solve the scaling debate.

an "alt coin" discussion! oh my shouldn't this be deleted?
@_date: 2017-06-12 20:01:00
so wait we can post about altcoins here? 
@_date: 2017-06-02 14:58:57
I read that as well. Social engineering is scary, especially when it comes to the possibility of circumventing 2FA.  But also, he must have been targeted for his email and password as well to CB.  And then also, why leave any substantial numeration of crypto on an exchange?  That was mistake  
@_date: 2017-06-12 15:54:14
another alt-coin discussion.  So weird!
