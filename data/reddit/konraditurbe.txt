If this happened it would be hilarious
@_date: 2018-01-28 18:14:59
Comment section here is woke lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 11:30:26
Less fees pls
@_date: 2018-01-21 15:04:56
Not anymore lol
@_date: 2018-01-27 16:02:53
Needs more blocksize (and SW+LN of course)
@_date: 2018-01-04 20:32:22
Right, I always think she killed Romero...
@_date: 2018-01-30 05:46:18
Wow, BTC is great again!
@_date: 2017-12-25 23:57:06
If Bitcoin raises the blocksize Bitcoin Cash will be so fucked they might as well just tell people to shapeshift and shut the currency down. Just saying as a BCH user 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:45:48
Definitely not as a currency
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:46:36
LN needs to come, otherwise BCH will win because it aims the M1 (cash) market not just the store of value market
@_date: 2017-12-20 03:57:43
Don't sell, why'd you sell?
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:42:28
Same, I don't understand people here mocking Bitcoin Cash because Roger, it's an ad-hominem flaw and it's very unprofessional. You don't need to agree with Roger (I don't) to use BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:14:12
It was at one time though
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:15:51
On Android Depends: if you're rooted try AdAway, if you don't want to trip SN and get updates try systemless Magisk hosts mount (in the app settings)
If you're not rooted use DNS66
@_date: 2017-12-26 21:20:59
Does SegWit increase blocks?
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:06:13
Google authenticator has an Android Wear app
@_date: 2017-12-29 15:03:13
Because we can, and because Bitcoin can serve as a tool to those being in less economically developed countries to send and receive money world wide instantly. Seems like people blinded by the price are the ones who truly care about Bitcoin, but that's not the case, i was able to buy products online using Bitcoin due to being 100% anonymous
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:44:57
@_date: 2017-12-28 23:07:31
Then what's the point of using Blockchain technology at all?
@_date: 2017-12-13 10:40:47
Then the professor gave him a crisp paper wallet containing 100mBTC%
@_date: 2017-12-26 22:20:43
What made me drop BTC for BCH is the incredibly fast adoption of BCH by all types of services (wallets, exchanges, stores, bots, etc...). Something Litecoin hasn't achieved yet. BTC already has the acceptability and integration, just needs cheap fees (0.00X$) and a transaction time that does not suck, just like it has when I joined in 2013!!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:32:17
Ah the old Bitcoin :) glad to be back 
@_date: 2017-12-19 21:47:06
You're damn right!!!
@_date: 2017-12-15 21:18:16
Yeah that's true, but then segwit takes place
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:29:00
tried coinbase and bitcoin wallet already, now trying mycelium
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:10:25
@_date: 2015-06-14 16:04:42
Going with mycelium then
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:11:28
And if the fees go down, a way to transact freely.
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:17:38
Which wallet? Honestly haven't used BTC in 6 month lol, 
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:12:30
People will not pay 10$ with BTC because of the fees, but they will pay using Bcash (until Bcash's fees are high, then its game over)
@_date: 2018-05-06 13:03:39
Lol he made a video about this post: 
@_date: 2018-05-06 20:49:08
He did not create Bitcoin Cash, he's not even a developer. Get your facts straight.
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:15:14
So I can wire my Nigerian prince with Bitcoins? Cool.
@_date: 2016-01-03 10:07:15
Stampery: 
@_date: 2016-06-13 16:28:35
Try now, 698
@_date: 2017-12-11 23:14:51
Or DNS66 if you want OTA updates (sadly AdAway never works with Magisk systemless mount)
@_date: 2017-08-13 05:51:18
It's Never a bad time to buy/sell ;)
@_date: 2017-11-28 11:20:50
yeah im lost on this one as well
@_date: 2017-11-30 07:02:33
Yes. It needs to be both 
@_date: 2017-11-29 04:39:01
Literally 
@_date: 2017-11-30 11:18:56
watch it when you're alone
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:56:30
I don't think Roger Ver's vision is understood correctly. What I understand is that he wants Bitcoin to have fees like in 2012-13, and fast transaction times regardless of how many people are using it. This of course needs a parameter increased. The block size (from 1MB to 8MB soft/32MB hard) is what can be increased allowing cheaper and faster transactions compared to BCore. This is what I want as well, a currency for day-to-day transactions AND a store of value.

Disclaimer: I have BCH.
Thanks to the increasing fees of Bitcoin I switched to Bitcoin Cash since it has no fees. Now, anyone with half a brain can figure out that BCH has 8Mb blocks and BTC has only 1Mb blocks. Having bigger blocks as advantages and disadvantages: it IS cheaper to transact using BCH, but 8Mb blocks mean most miners can't run a full node so BCH is *more or less* centralized (more than 40% of mining BCH activities are in China or in virtualized environments such as AWS). Increasing blocks is a good strategy in the short term, but what happens when the 8Mb blocks are full? Then they plan to increase it again. This will mean only centralize it more.
I can't wait for SegWit to be the norm and for BTC to be a currency (as in to buy and sell stuff using it) again. BCH, as per the development plans of today, is not a good currency (as in to buy and sell stuff using it) for long term use.
I haven't had a bad experience in the three lettered subreddit yet. 
@_date: 2018-02-13 16:01:58
I call it bcash
Oh wait 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:15:16
That is fucking madness holy shit. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 09:43:25
Faux bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:07:47
Bitcoin Cash, fees are pennies and it's quick.
edit: 14 hours and no ban!
@_date: 2018-04-30 15:11:15
Everyone says LN, but is there an easy guide on how to accept LN payments? Maybe using an exchange (exchange hosting the node)?
@_date: 2016-07-11 22:30:29
Pun intended?
