I've only been doing in debth research for a year now. Id like to say I know a pretty good amount but this stuff changes 10x faster than stocks.

Do you do any technical analysis? I'm not the person for mining. I just know very basic 
@_date: 2018-08-09 03:44:03
GPU mining is still effective. Basic computers are not made for mining. You'll have to build or buy the rig that is made for mining.

What GPUs are you running? What coin are you trying to mine?

If your looking for a coin that is a little more private I would use moenero otherwise sign up for coinbase and give it a try

Ahh, yeah look at the price between 2013 and 2018. Also the algorithms have become much much harder. You can download minergate and see how your hashrate then put it into a calculator.

Not illegal. I would think you can but I have never tried. It's either bank account or debit card if that helps

The BTC is split depending on work. So if you and me are mining and my rig did 40% of the work and yours did 60% I will get 40% of the BTC distributed and you would get 60%.

He's just asking to learn. Everyone starts somewhere.
Though, I can agree this information is readily available elsewhere.

Why would you be worried about moving BTC? Just wondering
@_date: 2018-06-22 03:55:28
Sign up for coinbase. Read the bitcoin whitepaper.

This website is garbage. 
@_date: 2018-06-21 23:37:10
It can be a multitude of things but high transaction rates can be a main cause
