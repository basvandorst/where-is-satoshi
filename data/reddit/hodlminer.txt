That's an amazing responde, thank you so much for your time. I try not to tell anyone I don't trust, but you made me think the worst and I will now be extra careful. Maybe I should just be ok with no paying taxes, you are right. I contacted a local lawyer who is relevant in the btc community here, and he gave me some options that I didn't like very much. Theoretically if I had all the history of the btc from the beginning I would be ok, but I don't trust it it for sure since I've never heard of any case like mine and I don't want to test something new without being totally sure it's ok. Again, thank you for your time.

I do have photos of the rig, and old posts in forums talking about mining. I could provide my actual btc address and just show how it vaguely links to the pools, buy nothing very specific. Do you actually think this should help? Is there a way to Cash out and pay taxes in the US to make it legal there and then just send the money here via wire?

Yes, it's one of the options I am more interested in. The bad thing is I would have to pay monthly for 20 years or who knows how long, which is something I wanted to avoid. Also, to be absolutely safe, I would have to sell the Btc now to be sure I will be able to pay everything in case I stop having any income, which sucks if you still have to worry paying something for so long. Also, I guess would have to keep a formal income to justify all the payments along the years

I do intend to cash out half or maybe even little less. But I would like a global solution for the whole amount of btc to stop worrying about it

Thank you, that is a good advise.

I tried to get all the information I can using Bitcoin Seer, but it's not very clear, there are lots of connections in between that you can't really see very clear, or maybe I just don't know how to do it. I don't see how I could show this to the agency that regulates this stuff on my country and be safe

I read the FAQ but there's nothing about mining instead of buying. Also, I'm not in the US

Looks interesting. But how is the money loaned declared? Like a loan with some interest rate, or a donation?

Si, conozco a los chicos de la fundación. Sinceramente, como comentaron arriba, no me gusta mucho la idea de estar comentandoselo a mucho gente, pero te agradezco realmente por tu interés en ayudarme. Te pregunto, la solución que me planteas es "legítima" o dentro de lo que todos ya conocemos?

Sorry, it's Argentina. Is there any solution within US laws that I could do being from other place?
