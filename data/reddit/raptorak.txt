It's like the central banking system. Let's say you use Bank A and I use Bank B. I send you $10 and you send me $5 and I send you $10 again. All that data is on the banks' side. All the main system needs to know is that I sent you $15 (I sent 20 but you sent 5 so it's a net of 15).

LN will, in theory, reduce transaction backlogs. This, in turn, means lower fees and faster confirmations. So LN does not directly benefit in those cases but indirectly does.
@_date: 2015-12-13 04:36:02
Correct me if I'm wrong but can't the other party just re-send the coins with a fee this time, and the new one gets confirmed, the one without fees gets disregarded as a doublespend?

English is the hardest (so hard, in fact, that most Americans still can't write properly and often butcher sentences because they have no idea what they're saying. Things like "per say" and "I could care less" are really common).

Don't automatically dismiss it though. When I launch my site "soon," it won't be moderated aside from straight-up spam. If people disagree with my statements, I accept that. I also don't bow down to selling out. In fact, I'm a gamer and when I run fansites (official ones endorsed by the game publishers themselves) I make it very clear that my opinions will always be shared. If I disagree with what a game publisher did or stated, I have no issues calling them out on it. Contrary to my fear in the beginning (I always figured I'd lose the endorsements as a result of that), so far everyone's been on board.
I'll bring the same thing to the crypto world. Honest reporting without trying to sugar coat things. And that includes possible sponsors. I'd rather get absolutely nothing from a company than to lie to my readers about what's really going on.

That's what, 0.1 BTC? Sure. People used to give away entire bitcoins for fun on Bitcointalk and other places back when they had little value. Even when they were a few dollars people would often throw a few at random people just because. It wasn't until Bitcoin went into the media and shot up in value that it became all about hoarding and scamming each other to steal as much as possible.

I see a lot of people talking about CCN here. They clearly mark when they are doing sponsored stories. I'm personally more worried about their **complete lack of editing.** Most of the articles are so full of errors I gave up on trusting them long ago.
As an example, David Parker (who I believe is the owner of CCN) posted this article: 
He couldn't even edit his own article prior to posting, as seen here: "I wanted to share my response to TomOnBTC or “Anthony”, including re-submit his entire article..." This was the second sentence in the article, and in itself already has three errors (one of which makes the sentence itself make no sense and makes the entire sentence screwed up). I don't see how anyone can take a journalism site as being legitimate when they can't even do the basics properly.
It's not just David, either. I've only seen one or two articles (out of over 100 I had looked at in the past) that were actually written properly. It's sad that these are the news sites we're dealing with in the crypto world.

I saw. I didn't see your article as trying to show that you're the premiere source of bitcoin information, though.
The worst part is I've attempted to work with all of the major sites as an editor and proofreader. None of them seem to be interested because the quality of standards is already so low that there's no reason for them to increase theirs (at least this is how it appears). It's just something that really bothers me. I can understand an error here and there, but when articles are literally covered in mistakes, misused words and screwed up sentences, there's a problem.

The entire situation would turn the ads into a subjective setting, picking and choosing their favorites. This is absolutely what we do not want from a search engine.

And yeah, it's pretty bad and it's getting worse. I've seen graduate-level English papers (with people getting degrees in things like journalism) that can't differentiate between things like "your" and "you're" or "to" and "too." Far too many people rely on spell-check to solve everything.

This is something a lot of people don't realize. I've had it take 5-6 days for a credit card transaction to actually hit my account and be finalized, and as many as 4 days for it to even show up as pending.

I'm not saying it's not worth using. I even use it. Just that this idea (the statement about them covering 10k pushes the idea) that it's pretty much risk-free is naive at best. I know and accept the risks, but I'd never try to push it as a very safe service

I've never been able to get to the wallet side of explaining things yet. A lot of people in the crypto realm are delusionally thinking that people don't care how things work. The reason they don't care how credit cards work is because they are legally AND financially protected against fraud. I can hand you my credit card right now and wait for you to use it before I report it as missing/stolen and have NO liabilities there. With Bitcoin, I can't even hand you my key without it being instantly considered compromised and gone forever with absolutely no recourse.
This is why people don't care how credit cards work. Because they have zero risk. Nobody can hurt them.
@_date: 2015-02-06 19:48:52
+1. And then when you try to explain it, even in simple terms, it turns into "oh, so why would I put money into it when someone can just hack the Bitcoin and take everyone's coins?" When you start to get technical, it turns people away because it turns into "Sony was hacked. Target was hacked. XYZ were all hacked. So obviously Bitcoin can be hacked, too, and someone has probably already done it and people just don't know yet, like how it takes companies months to find their breaches."
@_date: 2015-02-06 20:10:44
Doesn't help when you have things like this, either: 
"Autumn Radtke, the CEO of Bitcoin, took her own life..."
And that's just one example. There have been many references to the President of Bitcoin and CEO of Bitcoin in official news channels.

I don't get the question. People sell these all the time. This is simply an auction, just like any other auction (ie. its price depends on how high it gets bid up).
So what's the question here?
@_date: 2013-08-19 16:48:12
Here's the issue with that, though:
I have $200 to spend. I spend $100 on a 10 GH/s system now.
Bob has $200 to spend. He spends $100 on a 10 GH/s system now.
In 6 months, the 10 GH/s system is $10. I buy 10. Bob buys 10. We end up in the same situation where each GH/s is worth less than the previous one.
As the prices of equipment go down, people will keep buying more and more. As this happens, all older stuff becomes obsolete and the system always favors those who have the cash to be the *first* with the latest and greatest. If you're a year behind, the situation will keep getting worse. So your only way to "fight back" is to continually throw more and more money at it just to keep equal with where you used to be. And if you don't have enough cash to front for the latest things, you will be left behind and your investment will have been worthless anyways.
This is a self-defeating cycle.
@_date: 2013-08-22 23:53:56
Working on it as we speak but this question was a little redundant I felt: "Would a growing number of Bitcoin vendors make it easier to live off Bitcoin?"

Possibly security issue as well: when you sign up, it sends your username and password to you in puretext. It should not send the password out for obvious security reasons. If someone forgets their password, they should be able to reset it via the site, and then again, it shouldn't send it to them in email.
@_date: 2013-08-25 23:11:25
Yet another thing: the slogan is "Will Work for Coins," but the site revolves more around the employers than it does the workers. This is seen by the fact that only employers can make a listing. It should be more along the lines of "Will Pay With Coins" or "Get Paid via Bitcoin." Otherwise you're sending out the wrong message (more or less the current slogan makes it seem more like fiverr, where it is the workers making the listings, rather than the employers).

@_date: 2013-08-19 15:23:49
This. A way to look at it is like this:
Bob starts out with $100. He has 100% of the rate.
Fran comes out with $100. Each now has 50%.
Bob wants to get up to 75%. He now has to TRIPLE his to $300 ($300/400 = 75%).
Fran wants to get up to 75%. He has to throw out $800 now ($800+100 original + $300 Bob has = $1200. $900/1200 = 75%).
This cycle will keep going on and on, constantly getting more and more expensive. And there's another thing to look at here as well.
Bob has 100 GH/s. Fran has 100 GH/s. Each of them is earning 100 BTC per day off their miners.
Bob increases his hash rate to 200 GH/s and Fran stays at 100 GH/s. Bob did NOT double his earnings. He has boosted them from 100 BTC a day to 135 or so, although he just spent twice as much getting there.
Why does this happen? Because Bob, by adding more hash rate, is diluting the earnings per GH/s. The more he adds, the less each of his GH/s actually becomes.
Far too many people are not thinking about this. They say "oh, xxx is about to have half of the hash rate." False. If they add in 100% of the hash rate we have RIGHT NOW, they will end up with half. If they add 50% of the hash rate we have RIGHT NOW, they will end up with 33% ((100+50)/3=33.3%).
Edit: Also, this is why people calculating their "projected profit" based on what it's like now makes no sense. By nature of someone even adding hash rate, they are already increasing the difficulty and lowering their own profitability.

I finally got mine to go through (the second transaction was canceled). I had to split it into smaller blocks of 0.1 (first) and 0.5 (for each thereafter) and all hit the BC instantly. Apparently the size of the transaction was too big for them to push it through the first two times so splitting it helped...
@_date: 2013-08-19 17:13:29
Keep throwing more money at it than your competitors do.  That's essentially what it's a battle of; who has the most money. Those with the most money will always have the biggest advantage here.
To help explain that a bit more using the above example:
If I and Bob both left it at our initial $100 investment, we'd both earn 50% of the coins. If he throws $3000 more at it and I don't, I earn almost nothing. As a result, I have to put in the same amount as he does to *stay equal*. If I want to earn more than him I have to throw *more than him* in there. So if he adds $3000, I have to add $4000+. If he does another $10k, I have to do another $11k+. The cycle never ends.
@_date: 2013-08-25 17:14:16
*grabs popcorn* The responses I've read so far (23 of them, minus the OP's) have been entertaining, and so TRUE. Can't wait to see what others have to say, :). As far as I can tell people have hit on every point I was going to throw out though.

Do what I mentioned up above. Ask your bank. There is one place that knows what you can and can not do: your bank. Anything else people say, when dealing with something this important, is absolutely worthless. If you feel risking everything on what others are saying is worth it to you, go for it. But if it were me, I'd ask my bank, get the answer up-front, and know in advance whether what I'm doing is allowed or it's going to get me in trouble. If it's the latter, I can then move elsewhere to deal with a less Bitcoin-hostile bank.
For what it's worth, in the amount of time you've spent just on this posting alone, you could have a 100% verified, guaranteed answer to your question. I promise you, you won't go to jail or whatever you feel is going to happen to you simply by asking your bank a question. This is what customer service is paid for.

Here's the issue:
Someone says "I've used x bank for many months with no problems." That could simply mean the bank has rules against it *but hasn't started closing accounts as it's not too big of a problem... yet.*
Someone says "My bank banned me for making Bitcoin-related transactions." Really? What did you do *prior* to this? What may have led up to this? Oh, that's right; everyone is innocent at all times.
In either case, the answer you get from individuals means absolutely nothing. If you're using a throwaway bank account and really don't care about having funds seized, I guess it's not a big deal. If you don't want to risk losing your money and/or your main account, it is.

Good, because this is what you want. If you are paying a portion of what the site may or may not make, you are getting people who can not treat the job properly.

A way to look at it (correct me if I'm wrong) is like this:
You give someone $10.
With cash: "alright, it looks legit. Thanks!"
With Bitcoin: "alright, thank you. Please give me a short while so I can run it by a couple hundred banks to see if their consensus is that it's real or not. If they all agree, I can trust that the money's real. If they don't, we might have a problem. Please stand with me while we go through the checks."

I am 99.9998% sure the fee from Coinbase is 1%. At least, that's what their site says: 
Not really sure where you get a 10% fee from, but even if it WERE a 100% fee, now you have 9 BTC ($3600) instead of 5 BTC ($2000), still a massive jump with much less risk and 0 work involved.
@_date: 2013-11-01 02:36:27
Good luck. I tried to transfer BTC out a couple days ago (BTC that I personally transferred from my wallet to Coinbase many months ago) and after 30 hours it still hadn't hit the blockchain. I sent another transaction and after 24 hours still hasn't hit the blockchain and it looks like it's going to be canceled. So even if you have your BTC there, getting it elsewhere is another issue.

For reference, here's the ending results for a 6 week period (ending on the 15th of October):
09/01-09/15: +39.48
09/15-10/01: -81.84
10/01-10/15: -88.92
(Note: that's per period, not cumulative, so over that 6 week period there were losses of 130 BTC)

Question: is it just a piece of metal? I mean, I don't get how the heat sink works in theory I guess. Wouldn't the metal surface heat up, resulting in the same problem (heat) you'd have without it? Kind of like a pan does?

Ah, well nobody can tell you. It's like anything else, but there's nothing shady about the posting because it's auction-style so it could end at that price or could go up. I'd see it as being no different than eBay. Either the seller is legit or they aren't.

... Ask your bank? They are the only ones who can possibly know this answer. Everything else you find from others will be unsubstantiated (you have no idea what they did prior to being closed/banned).
Simply send them an email or call and ask what their policy is on Bitcoin-related EFT's.

I think the only other method is to create a sort of padding that is the median between what Bitcoin is worth now and what it may be worth. You have to buy your products from somewhere (presumably using cash), therefore you have to account for that. If Bitcoin drops to $1 and you are still selling for 2 BTC but you are paying $10 per shirt, you're going to have issues. The same goes in the opposite direction. So I think finding a balance that helps you keep safe through minor fluctuations is best. And then set up a separate plan for if BTC tanks or rises exponentially.

Yeah, that was the idea I got last night... waiting for the cancel to hit so I can give it a go. The sad part is I'm only trying to move 1.5 BTC... I can't imagine people who have more than that trying to move theirs.

"Follow Us" and "Subscribe" buttons on the right side. Make the entire boxes click-able. Or at least link up the images as well. As it is, your attention is dragged more towards the center/right-side of the box but only the title (left side) is click-able. This is counter-intuitive.
(Hopefully some of these things are helpful to you, :p. Listing one by one for organization purposes)

Not the best looking app but it loads FAST, compresses the blockchain and is full-featured (so you can even get generated coins on it).

Bitcanary is selling the new ones... he's an official reseller for ASICMINER. There was one reseller that lets them go for like 4.5 BTC but I forgot the link...

 -&gt; Preferences. The things near the top aren't centered properly. For example, the drop-down and year for "Availability." Near the bottom things are centered perfectly though.

I'd love one just to have an ASIC and to mess with it. Sadly, investing in ASIC's at this point isn't likely to result in any ROI, so it would be more of a fun little toy than anything.
Being that the power usage is negligible, I'd also have no issues with keeping it running all the time to help out the network (as little as it is) and whatnot.
Edit: I don't have an raspberry pi like some people, but I'd run it on my desktop that's up 24/7.

Seriously, don't feel bad. For some reason in my mind I had the situation reversed so it confused me until it was better explained. I was wondering why BTC's were worth MORE there when people can't withdraw their money (meaning they should be worth less).
The best way to look at it is like a debt transfer. Let's say a Bitcoin goes for $115 there. Someone has $115. Mt.Gox owes that person $115. Since they can't withdraw, they offer to buy someone else's Bitcoin for $115. They can then transfer the Bitcoin elsewhere and sell it for, say $99. Essentially they took a hit of $16 but at least now they have *something*, as opposed to nothing.

Will do! Considering it's a press release can I submit the one I already wrote up or do I need to re-write a custom one specifically for your site? :p.

At that point, difficulty goes down and the cycle restarts, :p.

I'll just leave this here: 
5 BTC for a single blade or 0.26 for a Block Eruptor, and he also gets them in very fast (plus has a great reputation).
Not sure why someone would pay you 0.05 BTC to tell them about a place where they cost *more*...

I've been using CB for 2+ months now and I've yet to have a single issue accepting or paying out Bitcoins... and I deal with a lot of payments.
I've heard a lot of horror stories about new people coming to CB, though, so maybe it's some issue with newer accounts that isn't present with older ones?
@_date: 2013-10-31 19:08:11
Aha, that makes sense. Hadn't thought about the size of the transaction in bytes. Thanks, :).
@_date: 2013-08-21 19:33:30
Here's the problem. You are "guaranteeing" a return of 20%, yet you are putting it into a volatile market. What happens if your investments tank or don't provide any ROI, or just very little?

But.. but.. I wasn't one of the first people in America so I didn't get my massive plots of pristine land. Now it's worth tens of millions. Let's go create our own new country elsewhere so we can have the biggest portion of the land!

I actually don't rely on those things either. I can't count the number of times people have complained about something/hated something and I loved it. I learned long ago that experiences vary from person to person. I've had many people say not to do x or go to y, and doing it anyways I find that it's been one of the best experiences I've had.
I guess it depends on how you look at it though. On important subjects, I take no risks. On less important (ie. restaurants, stores, etc.) I always get my own opinions.

Bug: even when logged in there is the button to "Login | Sign Up" on every page... kind of annoying. If anything, it should change to "Log Out."

In the analogy I posted, "spent" would mean it's fake. Unspent and transferred to you would mean it's real. Same thing with different words.

Did the campaign use their ad banner or the interstitials? Banners are clicked on by interested parties, whereas interstitials are forced (and are often ignored/adblocked out).

When I contacted my bank, I made sure that they understand I am looking for an official, verified response to my question. The person I got a hold of wasn't able to officially make a statement, so they sent the question up the line until it hit someone who could. This gives me a *written statement* so that if anything were to happen, I would have legal proof that what I was doing was allowed as per their terms and conditions.
Edit: just noticed your response up above. If this was done via email, live-chat, etc. and you have the time-stamp of the conversation it's enough to prove you broke no rules.
@_date: 2013-08-27 23:39:44
It's a little odd that so many people have been complaining about the response times. I just submitted a suggestion to them yesterday and already got back a response today on it...
I've never even hit the 24-hour mark on support requests with them and I've contacted them multiple times.
Maybe it's not "support" that's the issue, but a specific area (I've never had the "high risk" problem, so it could be handled by different people).

Just wanted to add in that my transaction just got canceled so I did as you said. Started out with a piece of 0.1 and all the transactions hit the blockchain instantly.

Speculation on profitability should be based on BTC's generated. Here's why:
You spend 10 BTC on your miner. Right now they are worth $100. That's $1000.
Over the life of the unit, it generates 5 BTC, and you are able to sell them at the then market value of $400 each. You made a great choice, right? Wrong.
You could have kept those same 10 BTC, and now you'd have 300% profit instead of just 100%, WITHOUT having to do any mining or anything in the process.

It's greed, plain and simple. People are all over this "well, I'll go ahead and risk $xxx.xx because I could get back tens of thousands of dollars by the end of this year alone" viewpoint. When they finally realize that's not the way the world works, they then get angry because they thought they were guaranteed to become rich off their investment and now they are no longer going to be.
As long as people continue this ignorance and greed, BFL and companies like it will flourish.
