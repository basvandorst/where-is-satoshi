Oh sorry if I calculate it right this second it's actually $83. 158,000 unconfirmed transactions with 755 BTC in fees.

If you actually read it, they stated $20 average fees which is true based on the arithmetic mean. Yes, the median is more like $5 but it isn't particularly dishonest IMO.

You have a fundamental misunderstanding of net neutrality and the internet.
Netflix is paying for bandwidth to deliver content, but you still need a connection to get the content that they are delivering. Both sides are paying for bandwidth here. 
The idea of net neutrality, in this context, is that if I'm paying for the bandwidth it shouldn't matter whether I use it to get content from Netflix, Google, Comcast, etc. they are all "neutral" content. It is like I am only paying for kWhs on my electricity bill - there is only one type of electricity.
The idea of "fast lanes" is that the internet service providers want to say that even though you paid for X GB of data, well you have to pay us extra if you want to use Netflix or any other services that they arbitrarily want to charge more for, even if you're still only using X GB of bandwidth that you and the content providers already paid for. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 15:03:44


They do.
@_date: 2015-05-11 14:22:06
That is not how internet access works. I might pay $30/month while Netflix is probably spending many thousands of dollars on their bandwidth. 
I don't even understand how my comparison with electricity, which is billed based on usage, could be misconstrued so completely. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 13:58:32
I don't think your metaphor with car neutrality is valid. Internet access is essentially a utility which is better compared to electricity in my opinion. Using your analogy, that is like saying you welcome there being multiple tiers of electricity service. At the top price tier you're guaranteed access all the time but on the lower tiers you have to suffer blackout periods or maybe your appliances could have a special chip in them that shuts off access if they require a higher tier than what you paid for. 
@_date: 2015-05-11 20:33:19
Net neutrality prevents companies from imposing additional charges depending on what the content is. Net neutrality just means 1GB = 1GB regardless of whether you're downloading Linux ISOs, watching Netflix, or posting on Reddit.

Except he didn't actually make $24,500. Those were unrealized profits. He was liquidated as the price went up, so he lost most or all of his $13,000. Also, he thinks that what happened to him is criminal, yet his greediness caused tons of people (including me) to lose a lot of money.

In the tech sector it is. Bitcoin went $3-&gt;$30-&gt;$7 in 4 months.
@_date: 2012-01-18 09:45:22
He posted his position on a public forum without blocking out any information, bragging about how much he "profited". Some savvy investor calculated the price that would force his position to be liquidated, and then bought up to that price (around $6.20 I'm guessing from the charts but there is a formula too) causing his BTC 14,500 to be liquidated and surged the price to $6.90 or so before "stabilizing" around $6. The person who bought up to $6.20 probably posted some sell orders in that range of $6.70-$6.95 to profit off the short squeeze he induced. Meelba set himself up to get screwed over, while screwing over many in the process and then whining when he lost it all.
Bitcoinica makes money regardless of how the market moves because of the fees Zhoutong collects, and I highly doubt it was his doing. Many orders that are posted on bitcoinica do not reach mtgox because they can be matched to opposing positions on bitcoinica internally, thus creating a smaller spread. For example, if someone was shorting 50 BTC at $6.50 and then someone else was going long 50 BTC at the same price the orders could be matched and would not be shown on mtgox.

If you ordered more than 45 days ago then it's ineligible for a refund now. I hope you didn't select "Gift" or "sending to friends/family" when you paid since that is automatically ineligible for chargebacks. Try calling your credit card company -- they may be able to do a chargeback up to 180 days after the transaction if you're lucky. Any more and there is no way you can get your money back.

KNC Miner is also getting their 28nm chip produced through eASIC, albeit through the 'value-added reseller' ORSoC. KNC has never taped out 28nm devices either. Are you saying that both companies are bogus? My money is on ActM coming through on their promises, and KNCMiner will be among their top competition.

Having a 1kW PSU just means your computer can deliver 1000W, not that it uses that much. There most certainly is a massive power consumption difference mining vs not.

This article seems quite poorly written. The title says the competitors are winning with lower rates and more features, but there is no mention of these in the article except the irrelevant details about Coinbase. 
They also try to compare the exchange rates of Mtgox and Bitstamp as "apples to apples" when the reason for the higher Gox price has been its liquidity problems for the last 2 months. 
Overall, it just seems like baseless speculation with a flashy title to get more clicks.

I think it would be about as fast as you expect Bitinstant to be once your account is verified (to prevent chargeback fraud). There are happy customers in their ad:

SatoshiDice has lost a ton of customers for this reason, and the fact that they have a 1.9% house edge. They have more than one competitor with 1% edge, and Just-Dice has both a 1% edge and allows huge bets (max bet is 450 BTC right now). Their impact on the blockchain is almost negligible anymore. 
In spite of this, I agree that number of transactions is not a great indicator since we would need to know the money velocity of Bitcoin and also how many of those transactions are being done by mixing services or simply moved between accounts owned by the same people.
