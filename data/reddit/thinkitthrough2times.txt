Bitwala is a very good service. Not even shilling. When I type wrong SEPA info in the customer support is getting back to me in minutes.
However, I'm not into this 'get all your friends on this platform' thing. First you need to tighten up your security and keep KYC away.

This video is actually super old already. Its just a repost. I don't think that farm is profitable anyways anymore, cause all the hardware you see is outdated. Cooling looks like a real problem there as well. The guy he's talking to was also in the “bitcoin end of money as you know it“ documentary. Sounds like a douche

Its a thought Experiment, these help people to see the boundaries of extreme but unlikely outcomes. This is how humanity came to what it is, you see?

Well, it sounds like you fomo'd hard. From their blog and so on the hashrate was even increased a few times for free, other cloud miners like the toomin brothers or zeropond didnt even bother and told customers to fuck off. 
No one knew what Zcash would be worth and the difficulty, issued coins were playing a big role in that. They acted as advertised and beyond that, the market hit you hard.
You're getting super fresh encrypted internet money tho :D Here's hoping you will ROI!

Now if Steam would just enable bitcoin already..

So is it a photoshop or not?

BraveNewCoin always has so informative articles! Shedding light on different aspects of the content. Love it. That said - I don't mine my own coins anymore, but Genesis took already a lot of effort to bring Bitcoin to the real world via their ad campaigns. The more people flood in, big or small, the better.

Nicely meme'd my friend!

ah thanks!

The thing is, you don't ask for "legitimacy" and "acceptance", you go and get it. This is what the Bitcoin community is doing for years now.
@_date: 2016-01-08 10:58:08
Most interesting hobbies are expensive, the thing is, they often really pay off after you've stuck to them.
75% of all Bitcoins are already mined, block halving is coming, price is going up. I think even if the coins you earn don't pay the bills right now, they could easily do so if you hoard them for the future.
@_date: 2016-01-21 16:04:32
Who said Bitcoin replaces banks? The whole deal is about innovation.

Just registered but the voucher page doesn't work for me. And no clue how I can transfer bitcoins to my account? Any advice? Thanks!

And in the last 8 hours we got the message that Jamie's pay rises 35% to 27 million dollars a year. That's without bonus and all the other background deals. :)
Don't get me wrong, i'm not mad or anything. But it's always funny to see the contrast in regards to a little bitcoin billboard.

Haha I like how Benjamin Franklin is staring from the back!
btw. this was the latest interview i believe
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:26:01
Bitcoin is a very abstract thing and I think the media is doing good showing stuff people actually know already, like using an ATM or server farms.
The rest is all knowledge that has to be perceived after. You still need  explain some known  way to enter the matrix, right :) 
@_date: 2017-01-18 08:16:52
I agree with this, what would they achieve by outcalling WaPo. Seems like they took that headline as example but placed that "fake news" line a little unfortunate.
@_date: 2017-01-09 09:23:08
The datacenter shown in the second part of the documentary is actually an Ethereum mining farm, called Enigma, by Genesis Mining. I guess it was just for the looks to impress people, as of course you would need ASIC hardware to mine Bitcoin and make a profit. 
Although the video is only scratching the surface I think it's interesting to see in action and sparks general interest in Bitcoin, which is always a good thing!

I don't think anyone gains something from posts like this. Your post wasn't very helpful and you're insulting. The response is calculated. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

Heh! Immersion cooling is super expensive though. For that kind of space per litre you can put a few more S9's with a nice cooling setup!

We had flowers in our hairs, danced to drums and meditated together to better the world. Then the price went up and our chakras opened up big time.
@_date: 2015-09-14 08:51:15
I can do it for you! *wink* 
@_date: 2018-07-16 17:11:44
Look up what cooling fluid costs, check the spacing needed to cool down the hardware, check size of miners.
Then check google and all big datacenter entities and why 90% of their datacenters do not rely on this system. :) 
Oh, and check BitFurys track record. More managers than devs. (This is only my opinion!!) 
Btw im not saying it aint cool! (Literally! :D ) 
@_date: 2015-09-07 21:37:52
Haha nice! Be sure to stick with it and dont spend it on the first "emergency". :)

Is anybody trusting that guy anyways? He is to Bitcoin what Alex Jones is to conapiracists, no?
@_date: 2016-10-22 15:53:31
People really need to calm down and don't scream scam at every bitcoin space company, especially if its only 50 bucks. Its ok after weeks of no responses and more critical data, but not like this. I hate how busibess social media pages evolve into angry customer outlets that get solved within a few days. Spoiled brats.

Nice to hear some drumming from miners once in a while

It's clean, but it is not nicely designed. In fact, there is almost no design. It's just enhanced tables.

That's no biggie, I lost like 10 BTC introducing people to it when it was worth $20. Nine out of ten people desolated their wallets. But you made an imprint on their minds! And now im the crypto god in their eyes! Feels kinda like the same as being the unofficial IT guy in work.

Thats the journalists fault tho and anyways, knowing there is a “bitcoin ceo“ is better than knowing nothing about btc. The first allows to be corrected, the second allows nothing.
