Ok, but I'm still struggling on how a single Bitcoin is divisible. Wouldn't it lose it's uniqueness if you divide it?

Hmm ok. I read that each Bitcoin can be divided to the 8th decimal. Does that mean that every 0.00000001 Bitcoin is unique? Or am I off on this uniqueness? Is it more like, the servers just record transactions, and to get your balance it recalculates all of your transactions, verifying each one all the way to the coin's inception? And if that's the case, wouldn't that eventually lead to server slow downs the more Bitcoins are passed around due to the growing number of calculations each time?
Also, thanks for being so helpful!

Oh, I will. I'm almost ready to start using Bitcoin. I just want to make sure I understand it as much as my little pea brain will allow me to before I take the plunge! :D

What is a Blockchain?

Ok, that's actually exactly the answer I was looking for. I'm sure the full explanation would go right over my head, but yours was right at eye level. But now I'm wondering what makes each Bitcoin unique? And if each one is unique, how is it possible to send an amount with decimals?

Yup! I get it! I've learned a lot by starting this thread!

Ok, thanks a lot! You've answered all the questions I have for now. I think I'm almost ready to start using Bitcoins!
