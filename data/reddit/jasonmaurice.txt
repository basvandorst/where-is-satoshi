The 13,900 BTC is what MtGox made from commissions, it isn't related to customer holdings.

so to clarify, my title is a bit misleading, kraken is going to be *supporting* mtgox, helping to investigate and pay out claims, not exactly taking over as i originally said.

bitFlyer is not a bitcoin exchange, it is a bitcoin dealer. the difference is that bitFlyer is the counterparty to all trades.
the interesting thing about this bitcoin dealership is to see if it will charge/pay its users 8% consumption tax similar to how gold dealers in japan have to do so.

In a Japanese corporation, the Representative Director is an official legal representative of the company, ie. this person is required to sign off on legal documents and notices. Since the notice is obviously from an attorney, they use the correct legal title for Mark.

This video makes no sense at all. The SIM is a hardware security module, similar to a trezor hardware bitcoin wallet. The purpose of using HSMs is that they do not allow the private keys to be extracted. If you don't use a HSM and store private keys in ordinary RAM, a hacker can steal the private keys from your device.

This is just the security company that Kobayashi hired to protect the coins, they are sweeping the coins from the addresses generated by mark's php code and moving them into proper cold storage.

You guys have to understand, there were about 50 court bailiffs and security officers patrolling the creditors meeting to enforce the strict no-photography-or-phones-inside-the-courthouse law. I had to hide the papers in my jacket, photograph each page of the document, upload it to imgur, and post it on reddit, all from a toilet stall inside the bathroom, and do it all as quickly as possible to not make it too obvious what I was doing... then run back to the creditors meeting to troll Kobayashi with more questions about why he hasn't recovered the stolen coins yet.

MY ROUGH TRANSLATION:
The management of the online bitcoin exchange Mt.Gox filed an application of bankruptcy protection under the Corporate Rehabilitation Law in Tokyo District Court on the 28th.
Due to the company's insolvency (debt &gt; assets), it may be impossible to return the approximate total 50 billion yen holdings of cash and bitcoins, which were held on behalf of the customers.
The company "MTGOX" (based in Shibuya-ku, Tokyo), applied for protection including total liabilities of about 6.5 billion yen.
Due to a serious fault in the trading system, it was not possible to properly disburse bitcoins and cash, and a decision was made to suspend operations.
About 750,000 BTC of customer holdings that were kept by the company were lost for an unspecified reason, and it was reported that the coins cannot be immediately recovered. (?)
Mark Karpeles, chief executive officer (CEO) of the company, gave an interview in the metropolitan area on the same day, and apologized "I am sorry for a system (dealings) to have a weak place, to lose a bitcoin, and to have made you trouble."
According to the representative's lawyer, in the company, the trouble to which remittance is not carried out normally succeeded one another at the beginning of the month [ 2 ].
A cause is regarded as unlawful access from the outside which abused the fault of the trading program.
It is claimed that the doubt pulled out unjustly also has bitcoin.
In investigation of the company, it is said that most of 750,000 BTC (about 41 billion yen in today's money) kept for the customer and 100,000 BTC (about 5.5 billion yen) which it has at its company were lost.
Furthermore, the potential 2.8 billion yen among the cash kept for the customers in the company's bank account is also reported to have disappeared.
When asked about the possibility of returning bitcoins to the customers, or cash, the representative's lawyer responded, "We have absolutely no idea."
Unlawful access by a hacker regards the company as the cause, and it says it "There is also such a trace" (lawyer) each that bitcoin and cash were lost.
After talking with an external specialist from now on, it is called the plan which takes out an incident report to the police.
The company setup an help desk (03-4588-3921) for responding to customer inquiries.
It is available from Monday to Friday, 10am to 5pm.

　申請したのは運営会社「ＭＴＧＯＸ」（東京都渋谷区）で、負債総額は約６５億円。取引システムに深刻な不具合があり、コインと現金の売買を仲介することができなくなったことから、事業をいったん閉じることにした。同社の口座で保管していた顧客のビットコイン約７５万枚が何らかの理由によって失われ、返還を求められてもすぐに対応できないという。
　同社のマルク・カルプレス最高経営責任者（ＣＥＯ）は同日都内で記者会見し、「（取引の）システムに弱いところがあってビットコインがなくなり、迷惑をかけて申し訳ない」と陳謝した。
　代理人の弁護士によると、同社では２月初め、送金が正常に行われないトラブルが相次いだ。原因は取引プログラムの不具合を悪用した外部からの不正アクセスとみられる。コインが不正に引き出された疑いもある、と主張している。
　同社の調査では、顧客から預かったコイン７５万枚（時価約４１０億円相当）と、自社でもつコイン１０万枚（約５５億円相当）の大半がなくなったという。さらに顧客から預かった現金のうち最大約２８億円が同社の銀行口座になく、消失しているという。

If you're trading cash for bitcoin, how can a state even be aware of your trades? I don't see how any laws are relevant or enforceable in that case.

TOKYO—A joint venture between a Chinese and American company plans to launch a new bitcoin exchange in Japan by August, attempting to fill the void left by the collapse of Mt. Gox, once the world's largest trading platform for the crypto-currency.
BitOcean, a Beijing-based bitcoin ATM maker, will team up with Atlas ATS, a New York-based exchange platform provider that has worked for large Wall Street financial institutions.
The new venture—BitOcean Japan—also hopes to purchase the assets of Tokyo-based Mt. Gox, which stopped operating in February and filed for protection from creditors under Japan's bankruptcy code.
While BitOcean Japan hopes to craft its new exchange around the remains of Mt. Gox, one of the founders of the new venture said they would create the Japan-based exchange even if the trustee overseeing the Mt. Gox case doesn't accept BitOcean's bid.
"The collapse of Mt. Gox caused great negative impact to the Bitcoin community. BitOcean wants to make some contribution to the community and creditors," Nan Xiaoning, founder and CEO of BitOcean, told The Wall Street Journal in an email.
BitOcean has 20 employees and was established last year. It currently makes bank-teller machines that can process bitcoins and also plans to expand to Hong Kong and Taiwan to offer exchange and ATM services later this year. The company is investing more than $1 million worth of bitcoins to start up the Japanese exchange, said one of its founders.
Mt. Gox, purchased in 2011 by a French entrepreneur, collapsed after hackers stole 850,000 bitcoins, worth half a billion dollars. Though the company later said it had recovered about one-fourth of the losses, a Japanese bankruptcy court ordered liquidation, and put the process in the hands of a court-appointed trustee.
Many Mt. Gox creditors worry that the trustee will order Mr. Gox's remaining assets be converted to conventional hard currencies, such as the U.S. dollar or the yen. They oppose that because they say it would significantly deflate the value of the bitcoins.

Japan Virtual Currency Firms to Launch Industry Group
One of backers for BitOcean Japan is an American attorney, Daniel Kelman, who is serving a general counsel and co-founder of the joint venture, and is himself a Mt. Gox creditor. He said he has in recent years been working with start-ups in Taiwan, but moved earlier this year to Japan to track the Mt. Gox bankruptcy proceedings.
"We retained lawyers a couple months ago and have been engaging the trustee and trying to influence the proceedings for a speedy distribution of bitcoins to creditors," Mr. Kelman said in an email.
In the BitOcean bid, the new venture would provide 49% of the company's equity to Mt. Gox creditors if the trustee accepts BitOcean's proposal.
"The plan is a win-win for creditors and us," said Mr. Kelman. "Creditors will get their assets returned while we will receive a large customer base."
BitOcean Japan isn't the only bidder for Mt. Gox. Sunlot, a U.S. firm backed by child actor-turned-entrepreneur Brock Pierce, has also made an offer. But Mt. Gox chief executive officer Mark Karpelès told the Journal in a recent interview that he opposes the Sunlot bid because that venture has proposed using some of Mt. Gox's proceeds for their rehabilitation plans, including advertising and auditing.
"I prefer a plan that won't use assets of Mt. Gox, so that creditors will be repaid more," Mr. Karpelès said.
BitOcean says it wouldn't rely on money from Mt. Gox creditors to rebuild the platform, but instead will use its $1 million-equivalent bitcoin investment stake to implement proposed rehabilitation steps, Mr. Kelman said.
In running the new exchange, the BitOcean venture would be structured to address some of the problems that led to Mt. Gox's demise, according to Mr. Kelman.
One problem for Mt. Gox was insufficient security against hackers. Mr. Kelman said BitOcean had better protection because it was joined by Atlas ATS, a U.S.-based exchange platform provider that has built and deployed systems to firms including Deutsche Bank, DBK.XE -0.22%  Morgan Stanley, MS -0.85%  and J.P. Morgan. JPM +0.43%
"Atlas hopes to be able to link our markets together with BitOcean, so together we could build a global liquid market for digital currency," Chief Executive Officer of Atlas ATS Shawn Sloves told the Journal in an e-mail.
Mt. Gox also had problems maintaining a relationship with a major Japanese bank. Its main bank, Mizuho Bank, had been pressing the exchange to close its account, for fear it could be used for money laundering. Mr. Kelman said the new exchange has already opened three bank accounts in Japan, as one of founders of the new exchange has been living in Japan for a long time and had built relationship of trust with the banks.
"All of the banks are aware of the nature of our business as a bitcoin exchange platform and that has not been a problem," Mr. Kelman said.
