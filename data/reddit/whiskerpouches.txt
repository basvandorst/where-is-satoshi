Is that you, Satoshi?

And I personally like calling it bits and cents(shortened from centibit).  "That burger meal will cost you five bits and thirty three cents."  For America, I think that will go over much better.  Well, that is once a bit gains the purchasing power of a dollar, more or less.

The two big candidates seem to be bits vs. the milli/micro system.  Why not both?  If someplace like America is more comfortable with bits, but some European countries want a metric-based system, software can give each participant to a transaction the nomenclature they prefer.

So in the real world, where fiat currencies can be inflated and destroy people's life savings, banks can take haircuts, and people are in total poverty because their geo-political area mandates the use of horribly mismanaged currency, those affected care more about instant, secure and intuitive transactions?

LN node operators can be anyone, regarding the technical aspect.  The more bitcoin they hold, the more transactions they can facilitate. The political aspect is a different matter.  Within a particular jurisdiction like the U.S.(and within the sub-jurisdictions of different states), what regulation will be applied to node operators?  LN channels facilitate transactions from point A to point B, and can't steal the funds that are passing through, as opposed to the situation with credit cards and banks having custodial control of your funds. Government regulation would have a significant impact on the degree of centralization/monopoly market structure.

The opening and closing of LN payment channels is done through transactions posted to the blockchain.  All of the in-channel transactions between opening and closing are kept private from miners.  LN node operators can collect fees for their service.

Yes, the practice of medicine is centralized.  Practice without license from the authorities and you will face prosecution.

Wouldn't it be better that soft fork changes can be made and tested, and build resilience through voluntary adoption, before trying to convince all participants to switch?

Why couldn't it be a solution?  Lightning channels seem like a checking account - pay the fee to set them up, load them up with however much money you would potentially spend over a certain period of time, and then the fee to close out the channels.  If you did it for an amount like $1000 equivalent over a month, wouldn't that be worth the entry and exit fees?

Can't see past the paywall, but the intro mentions banks issuing their own digital currency(presumably a crypto currency?).  If so, then this is a poorly titled article on the WSJ's part.
