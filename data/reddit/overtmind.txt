Sell and walk away, come back when BTC is not BTC anymore or when a new coin has ironed out some of the issues. The current iterations of bitcoin and ETC/ETH have me wary of any "Crypto 1.0" at this point. I'm just going to wait and see what pokes up in a few years now that the seeds have been sewn

You don't have to be an enthusiast to realize that they didn't need 70 million in a hot wallet to operate, even if supposedly secured by 2-of-3. I believe the false security of 2of3 is what led them to make such a foolish complacent mistake in the first place.

I mean I see the public key, but I'm not really getting the concept of "holding" without the private key. Not that I expected you to show a real one, but maybe the printing template. I mean you can print a public key anywhere. What gives it value is the private key, preferably BIP38

What I don't understand is that they've probably receive millions of dollars in bitcoin over their trial of it, and it's only gone up, way up, in the meantime. How the hell have they not seen a massive return on it?

You addressed "What changes a hash" which is almost an obvious answer... 
The question remains... what is changing the hash and at what point?

In theory, overtaking it shouldn't. My comment was more philosophical in nature with regard to asking potential criminals/scammers to stop. 
Point is, people who have found a way to exploit bitcoin for profit will not stop because you ask them nicely, nor will anyone in the real world who is trying to make money.

It really depends on if there is any actual significance to putting it in "airplane mode" beyond disallowing the user to make phone calls. 
I imagine the actual result of doing so would differ between manufacturers, and I am skeptical if it does actually disable the modem entirely as to not receive commands from cell towers. 
It's worth investigating, but highlights the problems of using proprietary hardware for secure platforms, because we will honestly never know.

You're off base here. 
What happened was an older wallet was accessed outside of blockchain.info and then he attempted to login to blockchain.info to see if there were any new keys after brute-forcing the wallet. 2FA, from my perspective, seems to have thwarted him from actually gaining those extra keys. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 20:32:09
What does?
@_date: 2014-01-20 11:14:49
There's the theoretical issue of the proprietary modems being able to control the phone from cellphone towers. Mind you, very slim chance of happening, but it's essentially a permanently backdoored device; all cellphones are.

If you don't know what i'm talking about then what I suggested isn't for you :) 
PGP stands for *Pretty Good Privacy* and is a suite of signing, encrypting, and other tools. It is often found coupled with email messages, as both the encryption used in the email, and the authenticaor, which is the signature that can be verified as coming from a certain public key. It's also used to sign files in order to maintain their authenticity. Being around bitcoin, you've probably seen this in the form of .sig signatures offered next to binaries. You can also hash a series of files and sign that too, as bitaddress.org has done on their site.

That follows because if the attack is successful, bitcoin is worth nothing (or significantly less).

I am beside myself that people think there's any other possibility. The masses truly do yearn to be led in the face of complexity, and this is why marketing is such a powerful tool. No large bank is going to get behind bitcoin instead of colluding together and making their own. I see it happening kind of like E-Corp in that one show, where there's two competing coins the larger and more accessible of which is backed by a huge conglomerate. Hell, they're already making those technologies now. Bitcoin was a free experiment for them that they could witness; there's zero chance that they don't take what they've learned and run in a direction that makes themselves rich.

The answer is invariably that you should not being using a web-based blockchain.info wallet. 
An android wallet on your phone (especially non-rooted) is far safer, especially with a pin, than what you're currently doing. (there are a few vetted wallets on F-droid.org, and also Mycelium you can download directly from their site) 
Electrum is also a great desktop wallet on nearly all platforms.

And I think it's really bullshit to call XT an "altcoin" given that if the voter percentage was reached it would have been the only chain in existence. Might it have had the effect of centralizing nodes? Sure... but was that the goal or ulterior motive? I don't propose to know the mind of someone who is manipulating to that degree, but I suspect he was just legitimately worried about the *situation that we are currently in*, which is that we plainly about about to have more transactions than the network can support.

Most hardware wallets are backed by BIP39 and make you write down the mnemonic key (often very long, and done is a series of sequences). In that sense the last resort _IS_ a paper wallet. 
The hardware is only a matter of convenience that allows you to securely use your coins, whereas the actual seed is virtually no different than the seed generated when you make a software electrum wallet. (where an offline Electrum wallet is just a BIP39- style HD paper wallet)

Clearly you did not try to buy something with bitcoin in the past few days. I did, it took 12 hours for the transaction to go through, and I always play "idiot" by letting one of the most popular wallets decide the "Priority" fee - and it still took twelve god damn hours. I play "idiot" because it lets me gauge how ordinary (but exposed) people see bitcoin. At this point, I don't see how anyone is using it unless they're a geek and hearing about it for the first time, or they're already invested in it.

While that makes perfect sense - psychologically you'd be better served by not having any tamper seals *at all* and instead provide an informative card inside the package explaining how cryptographic attestation works. 
In other words, having tamper seals at all tells the person opening the package that this is something to be considered, and when they realize there aren't even enough to matter, the customer might lose faith in the company. 
Like when there's an expectation that a third party is security-minded and they ask you to do something that's completely insecure, you lose faith that they know what they're talking about, and the trust is broken. Kind of like when people develop commercial security products that are closed source, in this day-in-age, that's laughable, especially with regard to things like bitcoin.
People tend to behave in predictable ways with the information they have, 
where most people probably wouldn't think about the relevance of a tamper evident seal if it weren't present. Being that it is, though, I think that's why you're getting so many questions about it. 
@_date: 2016-12-07 05:54:26
Fuck me. This is what I was using to convert to Fiat. Now what?
This is a big blow for me actually wanting to use bitcoin anymore, and I just got done having fun messing around with my new shiny ledger. 
I mean this effectively means that in order to be able to pay for things I need to sign up for _ALL_ opportunities like circle, in case more go down. How again is this supposed to be 'unbanked' and all about privacy and security? Seems to me like I'm increasing my attack surface by having to sign up for all these places where I have to give out my most personal information just to get a few USD to pay my rent. 
Don't get me wrong I don't blame bitcoin directly, I get it. Blame the US, regulations, yada yada, but I can do absolutely fuck all about that today when I need to pay for my debts next week. 
And don't tell me local bitcoins, that shit is so fucking shady. 
Edit: Gemini looks good so far. Same signup process as coinbase and circle pretty much. Not sure how the full trading process works but I used mtgox / campbx back in the day so I know how to do basic trades. If that's necessary to convert then so be it. I'm not sure if they're going to verify my identiy though. They seem to want a license and/or passport - I couldn't figure out if they wanted both and I only have a license. It would suck really hard if I have to go out and get a passport for like $200 to get some damn fiat

Not sure how to deal with subscriptions - currently most of my recurring bills are paid automatically - yet I don't want a third party to have control of my coins. So it would seem we need an online hotwallet (not web company, an actual desktop client) that can pay on a time interval I wonder how hard developing an extension to electrum to do that would be - but there's that pesky part where you have to type in your password before you can send a transaction. Seriously has this problem been solved yet for the do-it-yourselfer? I'm sure bitpay and coinbase can do something similar but it's not the same as doing it yourself

Except that if they use bitcoin their fees will inevitably be worse? I don't understand the point of this post. I'm not only referring to to "rich fee market" by the way, but also the inevitable collections that happen when you convert BTC to your local fiat currency in order to well, live, pay your employees, etc. In the end I would wager the money they lose would be greater not less than 5%.
I don't think a place that worries about 5% from VISA is going to switch to bitcoin which costs more, has less trusted companies to get the task at hand done (charge customers and pay employees) and is relatively difficult by comparison.

The latter is interpreted as a penalty for using your card, which is bad business for the card issuer.

Most wallets have change addresses for this reason (and to minimize the effect of exposing the public key) 
You *could* transfer it to yourself, even internally to various wallet addresses, or to other wallets you posses, but it still links it to where you sourced the coins. Since many people use coinbase, this is usually your bank account/name/address (all that nice AML info) 
Mixing breaks that link by putting the coins in an obfuscated pool that you hope spits back out, and sends to you, the right amount of coins you put in it. If done properly, the transaction information could only be stored at the mixer, and would thus make the exiting coins anonymous - UNTIL, let's say, that mixer is compromised (how can you tell? - you can't) and is willfully giving information to government entities, or is a government entity itself (Why wouldn't they just run the best one themselves, lol) - then it's trivial to link your fiat source to the address where it was sent to *after* mixing - whats worse is that only they have this evidence because it's not kept on the blockchain. Though, that could benefit you if you, by chance, do find a scrupulous mixer that really doesn't want to keep or store logs/information at all. 
In that sense, what bitcoin is, is the greatest honeypot in history - and the evidence is on par - or better - with being notarized/chain of custody

What he fails to mention or predict is all the disparity and wars necessary for the human race to cope with said technological expansion. When I was referencing my lifetime, it could have also meant that I wouldn't make it through the barrier because I'm not a wealthy man. I will not be getting a robot, and I will not be uploading my brain anywhere because those activities will surely be for the wealthy and privileged. I will probably die because I will have to fight for food.
Furthermore, his predictions, as the article suggests, is based on *moore's law* which, at this point, is basically impossible to continue.

Yes. Coinbase is for purchasing / selling bitcoins, not storing them. Bitcoins held by an address generated there are inherently owned by them and not you. They simply let you control them while you're still in good standing with them, and they're in good standing with the community.

Nope, this is it right here.
@_date: 2015-10-13 12:05:37
Well I'm specifically addressing the "(unless these are your own)" part of your comment. I took that as, you can ensure your own personal transactions reach the block chain if you mine your own transaction into your own block. I saw this as a targeted approach, but maybe I'm thinking about it incorrectly because it would be transmitted throughout the p2p network anyway, no? So i'll back up and just simply ask: Is there a way to ensure that a feeless transaction is mined taking it from transaction to blockchain on your own? Or is that basically some form of an attack
@_date: 2015-11-24 08:49:45
While I really admire her extreme early adoption of being unbanked, as your average IT person: 
1. I don't think being paid in bitcoin is a real option yet for most people    
    A. Not asking my employer because I don't want to be laughed at, and it's generally insulting to think you're important enough to uproot the entire payroll system just because you want to get paid however. Oh, and good luck getting fat lucy to figure out how to pay you in BTC when she can't even figure out QuickBooks or Excel properly 
1. Being "unbanked" like this makes me think you either don't have a serious job, or relying heavily on the help of other people that most may not have as a resource.
1. Your patronizing repetition of "Hey, would you pay me in bitcoin?" after explaining that you "Just ask to pay you in bitcoin" is child-like and irritating. Thanks for telling me to ask them to pay me in what I want, but I think you're missing the bigger picture here. Ok, so cash. 
1. Let's say I am a contractor, because I have been, there's no way in hell that I'm bringing up payment complications that will potentially damage the deal, especially when a lot of upper management doesn't think favorably of bitcoin because of all the negative things they've read on it (i.e. drug money, money laundering.) - I don't need my clients to form an opinion of me this way. 
1. "Fiat - which is government mony" - again, I'm not 5, thanks.
1. Once again with the landlord situation and utilities - I have better things to do than worry about than getting a bunch of money orders (THERE ARE FEES HERE, you didn't talk about that)    
    A. My landlord's a semi-independent old guy that isn't going to waste his time with bitcoin, and doubtfully takes it seriously    
    B. My city utility bill would need to be paid in cash, and I'm not going to take half a day to do that when I work 60 hours a week.    
    C. My power utility bill would need to be paid in cash, and I guess I would have to mail them that. They typically only accept a bank account, though, and a deposit.    
    D. Internet would also need to be paid in cash, probably in person at the branch office. Again, more wasted time here.
As someone who has dropped google apps in favor of privacy, microsoft in favor of linux and a mildly rigorous approach to FOSS, even shave with an old-timey double-edge razor, has used Gyft, etc, I'm prime for doing something like this, but it's just *not there* for me yet. I want to be busy making money and worrying less about how to manage it. 
Speaking of which, you haven't mentioned anything about investment - assuming that you don't take for granted bitcoin itself as an investment (it isn't) - How are you dealing with your 401K/IRA? The part where we're worrying more about "Google play, iTunes, xbox stores" more than making real money and investments is where I kind of lose you and stop taking this seriously.

 Nope - the incentive is already there, and poised not to change. It's just not good enough.

There's way more effort involved with forcefully taking money out of my physical wallet, plus I might shoot you. Some bot/malware on the internet scouring for btc wallets is an entirely different matter and is more like a self guided missile. There's no way to hold a piece of malware accountable, and it's also extremely unlikely to reveal the person behind one. 
I love bitcoin just as much as everyone here, but I think the "I don't see the difference between bitcoin and cash" argument is tired, and obviously incorrect. The fact of the matter is that it is easier to mess up and lose bitcoin than cash at this moment, and there are many hurdles ahead, namely educating the people, in order for this ever to be considered mainstream.

I don't know about you but gold bars are deflationary and if I saw one sitting in front of you I'd do whatever to get it from you. 
The argument is not that people won't want them, it's that they won't want to *spend them* because they perceive that they will always be worth more later if they "just wait" - I'm not exactly sure how to tackle that problem because it seems rational to a point - though I think the argument extends to the fact that if it becomes a very serious contender for replacing most currencies, then most people will *need* to spend it in order to live, buy goods and services, etc. 
@_date: 2016-07-03 05:18:30
Yeah I get the libertarian aspect, but I'm not so keen on the making it harder to tax part. The only real difference is that they can't go directly to my bank and take my money - they could still very much garner my wages from my employer, or subpoena me in front of a judge.

What has come to mind though, since I did some of that research: Isn't it potentially really really dangerous for the currency to basically be doing all exchanging from one place like mtgox? If the authorities take them down, isn't that basically it?

A little pro tip with bitinstant is to NOT deal with moneygram from any place but walmart because at walmart you can just hand in a form, cash, and be on your way. 
With any other place you have to deal with using the 'big red phone' and necessitates speaking your personal information outloud over the phone and can get awkward. 
My main tip though is to grab a few extra copies of the moneygram forms at walmart (they're blue w/ carbon copy) and fill them out BEFORE you go, since there's only an hour afford for you to pay for your BTC. 
Edit: They look like [This]( and can be found at the money center.

It's because of the non-revokability of the currency. Same with cash. 
You meet someone in any place but publicly, and he can hand you the cash, you transmit the coins, and then he pulls a gun on your or beats the fuck out of you and takes the cash he just handed you. 
Turn it around, and what you have is someone honestly giving you cash for coins, the seller appears to transmit coins, the person doesn't wait for a verification and the seller runs off with the cash and no real coins were given. 
If you can figure out a better way to do it person-to-person (with cash) for untrusted parties, by all means.

iirc the difficulty changes after a two-week baseline. The hashing algorithm will switch difficulty to keep a standard average of 1 block every 10 minutes.

My math skills are limited to basic calculus, but im pretty sure that if I have "10 BTC" today - the code changes - and tomorrow I have "100 BTC", but the limit is also multiplied by 10, the ratio is the same and the value will remain the same - with the exception of how people perceive the change.

The larger the company the easier it will be for them to not give a shit about letting you walk with 0 confirms, or maybe 1 in certain situations. 
Think of Wal-Mart and their current return policy. They don't give a shit about receipts, or even if you bought the shit there. It's somewhat of an honor system because it provides the incentive for people to get back in the store, and they generate more profit this way anyhow so the returned item is moot. Something similar will be true in the future about bitcoin purchases, I imagine. 
In sort: It's not a whole lot of liability for a large company to accept 0 confirms when they are being confirmed at a regular pace and the chances of a double spend are still low for goods and services in person.

I don't understand where these orange and blue lines are coming from. How do you quantify "wants?" 
I'm a newb and I bought in at $15 a few days ago, not too much. I'm really interested in learning more about this, but you've really highlighted nicely that I have no idea what I'm doing. 
I don't understand how people are buying and selling so fast either, it took a substantial learning curve just to figure out how to get bitcoins in the first place... I can only assume that people are doing this through their MtGox accounts? That was the only place I really saw that allowed you to quickly convert BTC &lt;-&gt; USD internally.

The other guy said it well too, but just to reiterate: 
What you're seeing isn't a *direct correlation*, but rather the product of interest generated in the currency, in fact.... You could also slap on the "google trends" graph of things bitcoin related, and that would also look similar. As you probably know, mining bitcoins is done at a certain difficulty rate that changes with the average total quantity of hashing power on the network. So effectually, we're looking at the correlation between increased interest (causing there to be more miners, more hashing power, more advanced technology...) and price.

It's about both actually. In order to truly skip the banking conglomerate, you need to first earn in BTC, and then spend in BTC. We are trapped if we continue to earn in a fiat currency and rely on the 'good nature' of the banking system to let us play with our 'toy' by buying BTC. 
It's also important to be able to spend BTC for goods and services, which as you're pointing out, is the way to really spark an economy. As you earn in BTC and spend your BTC, other people receive the BTC you've earned as payment for goods and servers and the cycle hopefully continues. The vast majority of hardships surrounding BTC are actually the fiat system limiting our wants and needs for their own greedy benefit.

Actually no you can't. I just basically said the same thing myself, but when you go and test it - if you have 2fa enabled for the security center as well as all others, you can't modify the API keys. 
Unless there's another way without using the website that I am unaware of...
Edit: well... it probably goes without being said that if you left it open after you wen to the security center and inputted a 2fa code, then yes ... but that is kind of the intended behavior minus the intruder watching.

Conversely, this can not be done for internal sites, as that remains secure. For anyone confused, exit nodes are just tor server daemons that are routing traffic from onionland -&gt; internet, thus the breakdown is usually between the exit node, and the ***cleartext*** internet. That's right, typically speaking if you use HTTPS through an exit node it can still remain secure. I don't know of any attack on that directly other than to be wary of your SSL certificates, as you are using exit nodes to browse the open internet, you could fall victim to a MITM attack.

I'm wondering how many other things in your life you secretly don't trust yourself with. 
To answer your question; probably the most secure method is to generate a paper wallet and put that in a safety deposit box, which also has the added benefit of not being an unusual thing to pass on with your will. 
@_date: 2013-04-03 20:33:03
It comes down to this: 
Would you give your actual wallet to someone and ask them for your credit card when you needed to use it? Or some cash?
If you are concerned about a certain address of yours being secure - an *offline* paper-wallet is the de facto standard. 
Electrum can generate offline wallets, so can armory, and pretty much every client ever. One thing I particularly like about Electrum is that it has an easy way to generate transactions from an unseeded wallet. This way you can generate the transaction on any computer you want, transfer the file to your offline wallet computer (has the seed/keys) and then sign the transaction. Use the reverse process to actually broadcast the transaction. 
There are also a plethora of ways to generate just plain paper addresses.  comes to mind. (view the certificate before trusting it)
@_date: 2013-04-20 05:00:12
Just realize that the only thing Electrum does differently, is that it uses a secure method to utilize a remote bitcoind server's copy of the blockchain, so that it doesn't have to.
That's literally all it's doing. (and some other magic like storing a certain limit of transactional history - imposed by each server individually)
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:00:07
You need to think outside the box here. This would work, and things clearly don't have to operate like they used to. If "we" can come up with bitcoin as a people, we can figure out how to change a measly decimal for convenience (I stress again, without changing the value.)

The problem is, while the market is in terms of money that billionaries hold, and certainly in the terms of money that corporations hold... There exists a problem where any number of multi-billion-dollar MNC's can influence it any way they want by pooling money in and out in opportune times.

I'd recommend using Armory or Electrum. I personally like electrum because of the simplistic seeded wallet that can be backed up on paper. This seed, in a sense, contains every address that wallet (Seed) will ever make (4 billion), so it's extremely safe in terms of losing private keys. The trade off is that you lose about 2^32 bits of security, but we're still talking about astronomical numbers. You'll be old and gray before anyone figures that out, probably. 
Electrum also doesn't require that you download the blockchain, as the client offloads this work to a few public servers, and allows you run your own server if you choose. (It's FOSS) 
Armory is also the gold standard of secure bitcoin wallets, but last I checked, it required both bitcoin-qt AND armory to be installed, as it piggybacked off bc-qt. I didn't necessarily like that, but when I was using it, it had a plethora of features that were pretty much only available using it. Multibit seems like a waste of time unless you install it quickly to restore a blockchain.info backup.
I used blockchain.info for a few months because that also does seem pretty secure. I liked all the web connected features available at my fingertips, and the portability and compatibility with things like smartphone devices. It's an all around great product in my mind, but it's still an online wallet, and as an online wallet it belongs at the bottom rung of secure-ability.

You're also not taking into account that when bitcoin is $1000/BTC that's pretty fucking depressive. Yes, you can buy in "fractions" but why not just move the *fucking* decimal to find a better single-digit equilibrium/parity?

I think one of the problems that we don't talk about enough is the increasing pressure not to use blockchain-downloading clients which will inevitably give online wallets like blockchain.info the upper hand. This will be due to the blockchain's increased size, and when it is large enough, will relinquish power to businesses because it's infeasible for the average person to store a 120GB file (on their tablets, since desktops are being phased out) when they can just get a wallet somewhere with someone maintaining it for them.

I don't have the time to go into it in detail, but the gist of it is that both hardware and software providers find that the cellphone model of doing business is more lucrative, thus they push forth more 'apps' and handheld devices like tablets and smartphones. On top of that, they use the technique of selling many more things for a lower average price, while still retaining the same profit margin ($0.99 apps). 
These devices are heavily locked down and not designed for any major content creation past things like 'instagram.' As well as limiting developers to what they can and can not due based on app store policies. (see apple and bitcoin perhaps)
This largely is causing the death of the desktop system and all parts and software contained under that umbrella - if you need proof of this, try to live with Windows 8 for a week and actually use the metro app store. It's not a very pleasant experience for actual computer usage, and the community resonates with the same tone.

Remember, your "coins" are not exposed to the electrum servers. Electrum servers are essentially a patched bitcoind server (the standard), and they simply expose the blockchain to the clients, while maintaining a list of transactions (that number next to the server is the retention number). 
Addresses are exposed to the servers, obviously. 
Your coins exist only in your electrum wallet, in an encrypted fasion, and can be generated at will from anywhere using the electrum client and your seed (which you've hopefully found a way to backup securely.)

One thing that doesn't make sense to me....
As mining becomes less of a lucrative thing, it would follow that less people will be mining.. Who's going to keep the whole system afloat when mining is a completely negative venture? Why are we assuming that there will always be new hardware available to compete when in the last two years we've made 3 types of hardware obsolete?
Is it not the miners who keep the whole system afloat by aggregating the transactions into blocks? I see a very clear line of number of miners decreasing with the increase in mining difficulty. Has this not already happened?

Regarding Edit 3: Your first few paragraphs gave me a feeling of.... Wow, it would be fairly easy to setup up another account for a while and then one day use it to claim that I had stolen BTC with a sob story. What always happens in the situation? Some whale donates usually a modest amount. 
Now, I'm not saying at all that this is you, nor do I feel like that after reading more than 10% of your post, but the first few paragraphs awoke the skeptic in me. I just thought I'd lend a perspective as to maybe why you had to write that 3rd edit.

I've read this thread intently and I wouldn't be surprised if their gox account was hacked and emptied. (i'm assuming they have to have one to use the API to issue codes) 
Random thought though, I mean, It could be a number of things. 
The trend though is people who use gox coupon codes are getting burned more often it seems.

Armory is a fantastic client that has *extensive* advanced options should you need them. Last time I used it though, it required both the bitcoin client for the blockchain and the armory client which piggybacks off bitcoin-qt. I didn't like that about it, but in a pinch I could see myself using it if I needed some advanced features.

No. I can manage without all that stuff. 
All I really want is a way to easily buy bitcoins.
Coinbase is out, you can't trust bitinstant for a while, the rest of my payment options involve depositing at a bank that is now closed... you can't use credit cards or paypal unless you've already successfully done some shady ordering on OTC ... 
I have probably over **20** bitcoin related accounts and I still have *no fucking way to buy bitcoin* &gt;:O
@_date: 2013-08-06 13:04:43
Yes but it normally doesn't instantly affect the price of goods and services, let's say at the grocery store overnight. There's a certain latency involved with that. With bitcoin, everything so far is linked directly to an average price, or the market price itself and this only worsens the effect of volatility.

... Which I think is a remnant of when bitcoin was worth a few bucks, which would have made sense then. I just think he's left it alone to see if anyone will donate that much. Maybe it's profitable. It just doesn't seem likely that he would have wanted $40 for that from the start.... I would have probably payed $5 max. I wrote him a message about this after the price exploded but he never wrote back. :|

Bitcoin could hugely benefit from a better more reputable and worthy company holding the flag, so to speak. 
Unfortunately right now, I feel that the majorty of bitcoin acts and reacts like a Mt.Gox stock right now, and that needs to go.
@_date: 2013-01-24 04:18:22
Since I'm new... I can easily understand this line of logic.
What I don't understand is exactly who's doing this and taking a loss intentionally... 
I asked something similar here but none of that seems to explain that yes things are getting more difficult for miners and this seems to be outpacing technology... Which doesn't sound like it bodes well for the currency as a whole.
@_date: 2013-03-30 16:45:29
I've been thinking lately that Valve currently holds the power to change the world forever. 
They're going to generate decent video drivers for linux, support, and interest in free a open source operating system, which might just save it. It's could finally be the 'year of linux' soon.
Were they to accept Bitcoin as well, which is only natural, we're talking about an affected base of roughly 5 million people. That's a considerable threshold, and maybe next to amazon, they're the biggest player I can think of right now that has the power to change things. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 05:55:31
Clearly something went terribly wrong with their engine here. They probably just need more time to fix it and sort out the data so they can see what they lost (if any?) and how to resolve the issue.
What they really need to do at this point before it escalates is to admit guilt, explain the problem, and be forthcoming with the users that a resolution is on the way. 
If it's an internal issue as I suspect, they are not handling it like I would expect a reputable company. Considering they are pretty big in bitcoinland, any announcement would reach the frontpage relatively quickly. 
It does make me wonder if they're keeping silent because they know if they release that they've been hacked or an equivalently bad piece of news, it might affect the price - possibly causing it to crash -making resolution that much more difficult. They sure don't want to be responsible for popping the bubble.
Tough choice. 
@_date: 2013-05-19 06:03:36
What makes you say that? 
Forget about the porn part if that's what you're hinging on... 
Just remember that fringe industries like porn are always first into something like this because _they need the protection_ when no one will have them.
What this is really about though, is the ability for no one to tell you can't keep BTC, since you are essentially your own bank.
@_date: 2013-08-12 18:48:21
Enable it for EVERYTHING.
Also, I don't use Google for it either. I use a OTP plugin for keepass. 
@_date: 2013-05-09 18:14:28
It's just a matter of revealing different attack vectors. If you never spent from that address, the public key is still secret and thus you are still afforded the full protection of the hashed public address (from the public key that has yet to be revealed).
Upon spending you are stripped of that former level of protection and are now banking on the security of a different algorithm. 
Honestly, I don't think we bring this up enough where people realize it, but fortunately most wallets do this automatically. I periodically spend to my own address in full sometimes to re-secure them just in case.
@_date: 2013-05-14 08:45:17
If it was this kind of attack, it may be likely that someone was watching you via your webcam in order to ensure you weren't watching them commit the crime.

This is somewhat of an oranges/apples scenario though, isn't it? I mean, those are specialized closed-circuit switched networks designed specifically to trade at the smallest possible latency. 
Even a simple packet through the internet can take hundreds of milliseconds on a good day. I think MINUTES of lag is obnoxious, but a few seconds for that kind of volume might be ... acceptable?

I really hope this doesn't happen, because I have this innate feeling that people would 'automatically' trust it -bcuz google- and then that would be the dominant form of currency. 
I think in this sub we grossly overestimate how much -if at all- the average populace is concerned about the tenants for which bitcoin was created. There are many people like us, but consider what Google did to email.

You might think you're being clever here, but you're not, and I'll explain why. 
I need that car to live. 
Why? Well - if you read my original post, I said that in my area the closest localbitcoin sellers are in a 100 mile radius. 
This should indicate to you that I don't live in a metropolis, but rather in a small secluded rural town. 
Having no car is not an option. In fact, I would imagine that it would be imperative for any localbitcoins.com sales.
@_date: 2013-03-30 21:28:48
Plus I wasn't even just considering the raw driver support - that will improve... there are other more poignant things to consider, such as:
* Better audio support for HDMI/Displayport is a must for HD/Surround gaming, and it will come with valve.
* A paradigm shift from DirectX is essential. 
* Better support for things like NVidia PhysX
I like you.

I know what you mean, but I'd rather we frame in it a...

How much was your loss in fees (percentage) if you don't mind me asking - altogether that is. I was thinking about using them (haven't yet), but I did my purchasing on MLK day and the banks were closed. Had to use moneygram/bitinstant and deposited at walmart - total take on my cash was about 10% including the ATM fee, I need to do better than that... Though with the recent increase I've broken even. 
@_date: 2013-06-07 13:54:42
To your first paragraph, I figured as much...
Where does the average guy like me get a handle on all of this?
I want to make informed decisions, by either learning how to play the market, or just simply exiting until it's worth using. 
I just don't have the energy to keep a watchful eye on this if I keep seeing what I have in it worth less and less, and it's causing me to want to exit and come back when I hear that the coast is clear. 
I would like to invest some time in learning more about how all of this works, but I find it particularly difficult when what I've come in contact so far is essentially people who have no idea what they're talking about. 
I've watched the price go down 10 dollars since last night, but I'm not doing anything because I fear putting my money in any of the exchanges and not being able to do anything if something really crazy happens, you know, when they all basically get DDoS'd by their own userbase. There doesn't seem like a whole lot of options to do it correctly with out getting burned, yet some people seem to be making money with it on a daily basis. 
Clearly I want to be in the making money group, but I'm so confused.
@_date: 2013-03-22 06:28:52
I'm fucking ill equipped to understand wtf is going on too... I know nothing about finances. This just looks bad. Vertical lines are a no-no.
You're reassured me though because I do have an account at every exchange and have learned everything I can about bitcoin. I still know nothing about market forces and market behaviorism except that I'm watching this go on and I try and match up opinions and facts on to fluctuations. 
The one thing I don't understand is how people are doing this amount of quick-trading without keeping tons of money in an exchange. I don't trust exchanges. I want to see a place where I can deposit bitcoin into and have it immediately converted into USD.
@_date: 2013-06-17 03:38:11
