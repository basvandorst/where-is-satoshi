9PM is peak exchange time for them according to 
@_date: 2017-02-09 16:27:57
gemini 0.25% fees
@_date: 2017-02-21 05:05:51
2 days for me and all my buddies 
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:29:37
Why will there be a price drop if the ETF is denied? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:38:37
That's what I was thinking as well. I'm planning on purchasing some ahead of the results in hopes that it is accepted. My thought was if it's denied then oh well I just have more bitcoin (hodler) and things continue on in the same trend. 
@_date: 2017-03-16 14:41:50
maybe sell the bitcoin and buy another altcoin and move that coin to another exchange
@_date: 2017-03-16 16:01:51
Damn that sucks, you should prep to move to another exchange so when you're able to withdraw you don't have to wait.
@_date: 2017-01-13 16:38:45
Kraken is a great place if you can get your verification tiers done asap. I also use it because the fee is 0.16%. 
Before that I was depositing cash into Coinbase and then once it arrives I sent it to kraken to make the purchases.
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:57:08
I don't plan to but I just don't see it on the coinbase dashboard.
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:36:35
i thought a bank statement works as well?
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:05:16
I totally agree, I've been chasing my Tier 3 verification for literally 2 weeks. The email response is super slow, their system is all types of fucked up too keeps giving me errors. BUT, fees are dirty cheap lol. Imagine paying $3 on a $2k transaction. 
@_date: 2017-01-13 19:21:27
yea I mean you either pay 5% to get instant or pay 1.49% and wait like 10 days for your coin/cash. if you do large transactions then kraken is the way to go. is the wire transfer instant? Also do know the cost for other banks?
Edit: also buying from coinbase has a couple % higher than whats displayed on the dashboard so you have to factor that in as well.
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:44:55
Oh sorry I totally goofed, I deposited cash into coinbase USD wallet and then purchased btc and sent it to kraken. My bad on the mix up.
@_date: 2017-01-24 00:50:29
@_date: 2017-01-13 18:22:24
because I trade between different currencies. 
@_date: 2017-01-22 08:19:28
I check btcnews, but I was just checking the website you suggested and it changed.
Edit: newsbtc
@_date: 2017-01-26 19:49:01
After reading all the horror stories about Coinbase I pulled everything I had out, couldn't wait for my ledger.
@_date: 2017-01-20 20:53:18
Trump brought stability to bitcoin! lol
@_date: 2017-01-19 01:56:18
Why can't everyone be like you? ��
@_date: 2017-01-22 09:28:42
Yea I do, but I'm wondering if this sudden raise over the past couple days will correct itself so I can jump in again at a lower price 
@_date: 2017-01-18 20:39:56
what would you consider huge?
Edit: no pun intended
@_date: 2017-01-26 17:35:26
Gemini 
@_date: 2017-01-22 07:40:42
Considering buying some more right now. Bought some preemptively before trump speech yesterday, dunno if this is a good time to buy some more.
@_date: 2017-01-12 13:54:57
I use kraken, 0.16% fees as a buyer
@_date: 2017-01-17 22:17:30
besides bitcoin? Monero and ether probably 
@_date: 2017-01-19 16:41:38
sweet insight, totally answered the question
@_date: 2017-01-18 01:47:50
Sell that shit and buy more bitcoin!
@_date: 2017-01-19 19:26:49
lol that's awesome!
@_date: 2017-01-18 21:55:01
Yea I looked it up, $20 is defiantly worth it from the sounds of it. I'm just scared of losing it, I'm terrible with USBs and such.
@_date: 2017-01-20 14:57:21
Relax people it's a hat...
@_date: 2017-01-17 18:21:50
since when can you buy litecoin from coinbase?
@_date: 2017-01-14 21:01:30
I used Coinbase and I used my chase card
@_date: 2017-01-13 17:38:24
Deposit cash to coinbase into your USD wallet and send to kraken. 
Edit: I'd recommend using bank to avoid the 4.9% fee
Edit Edit: actually idk if you can deposit to USD wallet using card, I only used bank and idr if the fee was hit there or nah (pretty sure it wasn't).
@_date: 2017-01-26 23:06:42
Ledger 
@_date: 2017-04-07 21:38:35
I wouldn't store your coins in any exchange. They aren't safe as a wallet. If you're looking for storage options I'd get a ledger or a paper wallet. 
If you're looking for another exchange to use then I'd recommend either Gemini if you're US based or kraken. Poloniex is also good but they don't have direct deposit from a bank account or wire transfer like Coinbase.
If you do get a ledger, spring for the nano s. I thought I wouldn't be buying anything other than bitcoin when I first got my nano but now that I have other coins coins as well, I had to get the nano s.
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:19:36
Gemini is probably one of the most professional exchanges so they can get really busy at times. No need for concern
@_date: 2017-05-10 13:23:07
Right? Nah don't worry if there's any exchange to trust it's gemini. I know people will kill me for saying those words tho lol
