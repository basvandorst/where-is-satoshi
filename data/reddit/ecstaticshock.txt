In one word, completely. If Bitcoin is a pyramid scheme, then so is every publicly-traded company and every commodity that reached higher prices due to rising demand, for the very same reasons.
Since you don't seem to be using the standard, accepted definition of a Ponzi scheme, rather than accepting the burden of educating you, I've got to ask you to do the following:
1. Recite the correct definition of a Ponzi scheme.
2. Recite the correct definition of Bitcoin.
3. Establish that Bitcoin is an instance of a Ponzi scheme using the above definitions.
Once you've done these things, I'll be able to contribute more on this topic.

Your numbers are off.
* Writing 5000 words is not independent of content. 5000 words of stream-of-consciousness bullshit are cheaper than 5000 words of carefully reasoned and factually supported refutation.
* Fact finding for 5000 words of bullshit is highly unlikely to take 10 minutes ordinarily. More like 10 minutes per fact, if we care to find *reliable* sources rather than the first result in a Google search. Depending on the nature of the bullshit, one fact may not be sufficient, with a refutation requiring multiple facts used in conjunction to support it. Conclusion: not 10 minutes.

I thought you'd think of something like that. Have a trusted third party pay the miners for finding blocks. You've patched the hole created by ripping out the cryptocurrency by introducing a party everyone has to trust. That's not an acceptable fix, is it?
I'll explain a bit. Decentralized solutions are, by design, less efficient than centralized solutions. The decentralized model is useful when a central party cannot be trusted to be honest in perpetuity, i.e., when a central party stands to gain an advantage from being dishonest. If you take a decentralized system, and make its operation dependent on a central party, what you've made is an extraordinarily inefficient centralized system. While your proposed solution can work in some very narrow cases, it would be much less efficient than doing everything in a centralized manner, and would provide no benefit over that alternative. For the purpose of providing decentralized storage *for a network where no participant has to trust another*, the blockchain works correctly only when it is able to give miners an incentive to mine honestly *in a manner than no privileged party can obstruct*.


That was not my intention. If you had replied "that's nonsense, the two are inextricable as they are now," I'd have had nothing to catch you on.
This is more about some coverage Bitcoin was getting from people who wouldn't dare sully their mouths by praising the currency, but seemed to think that the blockchain was a great technical wonder, if only you could divorce it from that dirty drug money. They didn't seem to think even two steps down the path of having a blockchain without a cryptocurrency, and how it would be impotent to secure itself against malicious, but valid, writes.

In psychology, things usually cut both ways. People buy generic brands for equal quality goods at a lower price, and people also buy Rolex watches for their high price tag.

Pop psych aside, what's important is that Bitcoin is a different kind of asset. It's not stock, it's not a bond, and it's definitely not fiat. Prior to its launch, nothing like it had ever existed. It is different, and it needs to show it. All of these redenomination efforts are misguided because they try to make it look like more of the same, and, plainly, it isn't.

Getting donated computing power is one thing; giving incentive for people to invest more and more computing power is another. The currency mechanism creates a feedback loop where miners reinvest their earnings into mining equipment, causing an exponential growth in mining power over time. Moreover, if it were to become profitable to attack the poorly-secured blockchain, it would be powerless to provide a better incentive to mine honestly. It would lack the magic of the Bitcoin blockchain, where anyone who is capable of mounting a mining-based attack would be better off using their resources to mine honestly.
A beggar blockchain will have to cope with operating well outside of the design parameters of the technology. Bad things happen when you take a primitive and use it for something other than what it was designed for.

You can't always please everyone. A key benefit of Ricardian contracts, as opposed to paper contracts, is that a disgruntled buyer or seller can't show up with a forged contract claiming you didn't uphold it. This makes it possible to independently verify whether your decision on the dispute is in line with the contract the parties agreed to.
If the reputation system is based on WoT, as I believe it is, then it's not a matter of reviews. It's a matter of key-signing. In that way, as you trade and build connections, you'll find that more arbitrators are in your network because a number of sellers you trust decided that they trust the arbitrator. By default, everyone is untrusted. As a disgruntled trader, whether legitimately so or not, the worst you can do is revoke your trust in people in your network who have vouched for the arbitrator. If you were looking to extort someone, then that course of action is actually more destructive to yourself than to the arbitrator.

All power in the hands of rulers is derived from the individuals they rule through their obedience. If that obedience were to break, just who would they be ruling, and what use would their scrip be?

I disagree. States have a long and rich history of breaking limitations set upon them. I don't think the present moment is exceptional enough that it would warrant trying a repeatedly failed tactic again.


This seems to be an impossibility. If a state were not to engage in activities that create and maintain monopolies (because we don't want all existing monopolies to continue, right?), it would fall apart at the seams, as it is itself a monopoly.
Fundamentally, all the ways in which they plan society and economy are ways in which they create monopolies, even if they're subtle and ephemeral. For instance, what is a traffic light, if not a system of distributing temporary state-granted monopolies on traveling in a particular direction at a traffic junction?
Monopoly creation is essential to the function of the state, and it is no coincidence. The very first monopoly a state must create is itself.


Would it? The plan you suggested is one to keep the biggest, baddest, most dangerous monopoly in place, and task it with breaking up other monopolies, correct? Isn't that, for the most part, just leaving monopolies as they are?

Solar. Hydroelectric. Geothermic.

@_date: 2015-02-15 22:41:27
So let's come full circle on the wastefulness argument. If miners are looking for the cheapest power, that is, the power that is sold at the lowest price, reflecting that the generation facility is able to do it more efficiently, how are they wasteful?
I'll also call into notice that you've done nothing to refute my point that any waste that has to do with the primitive fuel used to produce electricity is on the power plant, not the miner.

The point I'm making is that miners don't set up electric generation facilities and decide the energy source. They hook into their town's electric grid and start mining. If the source of that energy is wasteful or harmful to the environment, that's on the power plant, not the miner.

You're suggesting bank-based investments as though they're a magical safe haven. I have some valuable information for anyone who took this post as anything other than a person trying to mislead you:
1) Banks have no more of a guaranteed existence than any other enterprise. Every generation, some industry that depended on the previous state of technology becomes obsolete. The people who are invested in yesterday's solutions get burned when today's solution comes out.
2) Banks are an obsolete institution and the goal of cryptocurrencies is to supplant fiat money, the foundation of banks. If you diversify to stay neutral, know this: cryptocurrency will appreciate MASSIVELY, while banks will yield only mediocre returns.
3) Banks are overinvested in States, another obsolete institution. I mostly speak for the US federal State when I say that it's coughing in its deathbed. Since it's a world empire, there may be a domino effect. This can prove disastrous for banking as we know it.
Overall, this post is like someone telling you, in 1900, to diversity from 100% Ford stock to 20% Ford stock, 80% various horse-drawn carriage company stocks.

The purpose of Bitcoin is to test this hypothesis. Since all currently-existing currencies outside of the coinsphere are heavily controlled and regulated, a radically different paradigm will put your belief to the test.
Now, we get to see your character. Are you someone who wants to discover the truth through an honest experiment, or are you someone who wants to poison the well before your dogma can be challenged?
Bitcoin is not only valuable because it's beyond direct government coercion -- money under the control of a government is like crack under the control of an addict -- but because it will produce something incredibly rare: an answer to a question that most people don't even think to ask.
Feel free to predict whatever end you want for Bitcoin. Just understand that if you try to poison it with government controls and coercive "regulation", you are showing a deep and profound cowardice, and invalidating your own belief by denying it a real-word test of whether it holds any water.

Please explain how legislators can do a better job of this than the developers.


This is a misleading question, and I'll explain why: you're trying to measure BTC's ease of use by asking people if it's easier to do something they've been doing for their entire lives or learn to use something new. **Of course** it's easier to do what you did yesterday! The second point is that it ignores that people don't have to directly interface with BTC. There will be profit in it for someone who creates a way of securely and transparently using Bitcoin as though they were just making online payments with dollars.
If you're using people's habits and lack of savvy for the new currency to justify regulation, you must not believe in regulation as much as you think you do. A law from congress isn't going to do anything to make it easier for old people to use Bitcoin. It's forward-thinking people who enable them to use it without even realizing it that will bridge that gap.

I agree that most countries in the world exist under the boot of currency debasement, and that is a bad thing. I also promote Bitcoin as a solution to this problem. I just disagree that organizations like the IMF are going to support Bitcoin. They're entrenched, old-paradigm/status-quo interests that will be the first in line to **fight** Bitcoin.
Insofar as they support a world currency, I believe they support a world **government-controlled** currency, such that one organization can enrich itself and its allies at the expense of every individual on this planet.
Also note that I'm not saying that Bitcoin won't catch on. I believe Bitcoin is the next world currency, with one caveat: it is the next world currency for individuals. States will fight tooth and nail to retain their old privilege of legitimized counterfeiting.
Will Europe, the US, Africa, Asia, etc. use it? You bet your ass they will. But why? Because individuals want control of their money. States will only go with the flow once they've exhausted every other option.

When I read that, I though "Al, you've just described your beloved dollar."
Firstly, bitcoin balances aren't made up. "Made up" means lacking proof of work, which is exactly contrary to what bitcoin is by design.
Second, they're not on a computer server. They're on a distributed, decentralized network of servers that hold each other accountable following a specified protocol. It would be a massive leap of imagination (or delusion) to liken that to a single (centralized) server.
Given those two points, what's left of his statement is "bitcoin is not bitcoin." Sober up before you write your next article, Al. If you've got to lie to people's faces and, ironically enough, cast aspersions on bitcoin by falsely claiming that it has the dollar's fundamental demerits, you're fighting a losing battle.

Regarding (4), I find it's easy to learn to think in terms of bitcoin if you get involved in trading altcoins. For instance, I can't tell you how many dollars to a namecoin, but I know it's ~.006 BTC.
This might be a small niche right now, and other cryptocurrencies are uniquely suited to be measured in BTC as opposed to fiat. However, it is what it is, and it shows that a bitcoin price is meaningful.

What I find ridiculous about this claim is the idea that people will be selling their bitcoins for the lowest price possible. Huh? Is that what people did when drugs were prohibited?
One must understand that, in the general case, one would be claiming that people will sell a commodity for a *lower* price when the risk of distributing it has just been *substantially* elevated. If you look at the case of any other contraband, whether it be drugs or a hacking service, this assertion crumbles into its constituent fallacies. If you want someone to take a higher risk, you're going to have to pay them more.
So, then, to claim that Bitcoin is the magical exception, it's going to take more evidence than some hand-waving.

If you don't see anything wrong with believing the inflation rate has been constant since a century ago, you might be too far gone.
Since 1914, there have been two world wars, and many other wars the US has engaged in. As we know since times immemorial, financing wars is the leading cause of currency debasement. From that alone, we can be reasonably skeptical when anyone tries to tell us the inflation rate is a constant. It changes depending on how many foreigners the feds want to kill.
If you don't have a grudge against Peter Schiff, he can explain how the State's claimed inflation rate is dubious and doesn't hold up to scrutiny. He'll elaborate that the methodology used to compute it is not only flawed, but deceptive by design. Here's the [video](

I don't have the time to hit this point-by-point, but I'll hit the most glaring faults in what you've presented.




That's theft. Every commodity on this planet is susceptible to theft. What you're presenting here is not a demerit of Bitcoin, but a ridiculous expectation on your part. Of course bitcoins can be *stolen*. What you can't do is *counterfeit* bitcoins, inflating the money supply, and siphoning purchasing power from *every Bitcoin holder on the planet*.




Just what are you expecting early adopters to do? Leave the network unsecured and susceptible to double-spending? Or would you prefer that Bitcoin be frozen in time, unmined and undeveloped, until you get your chance to be a zero-day adopter?
The world exists in real time. It doesn't wait for people, and it doesn't cater to complainers. Bitcoin being mined before you became aware of it is not a demerit, it's **the** merit that led to you becoming aware of it. Stop reinforcing this asinine whining point.

This presumes the existing financial infrastructure is going to last. Let's get some perspective:
1. The existing financial infrastructure is deeply in bed with a government that is frequently at risk of default on its debts.
2. The existing financial infrastructure is at the mercy of a few entities that can create wide-reaching catastrophes and be protected from the rightful consequences by the government.
You're right that, in the short term, it will be necessary to move funds across these systems. However, this will no longer be necessary once there is a self-sustaining Bitcoin economy.
I firmly believe that this will take place soon enough that, if any laws regarding Bitcoin are created, they will come too late. Enough people will have no exposure to their enforcement that they'll just be words on paper.

If democracy led to any sort of freedom, it wouldn't be as prominent as it is today.

Did these algorithms ever coexist with an unregulated stock market? I value your informed opinions and projections, but I have to ask whether this is an wild extrapolation from a small data set (i.e., the results of these algorithms on a tightly controlled market) or something with a past analogue with consequences matching your predictions.
In any case, given that these algorithms will inevitably be unleashed on Bitcoin, I'm curious to see what takes place as a result. Maybe market regulation was preventing amateurs from becoming better, less emotional traders, and Bitcoin could demonstrate how people learn and behave differently in an unregulated market.
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:13:17
This assumes that regulation serves only to hamper this, and doesn't confer advantages or protections to the financial firms that trade like this. We know better than this; the financial sector does a very good job of getting favorable regulations passed.

That's a total fantasy scenario.
If Bitcoin is a successful currency chosen by market entities, there is no reason to pass legal tender laws for it; the purpose of legal tender laws is to impose a penalty on merchants for not using a State-sponsored currency, usually a worthless one (fiat), as it is completely unnecessary to coerce people into using something valuable.
On the contrary, States need legal tender that they can manipulate by debasement. What is more likely is that merchants will not be allowed to sell only for Bitcoin, but be pushed to accept fiat against their will. This move has only ever led to disaster: merchants stop selling for fear that they'll be forced to take worthless paper, except through secret trades, much like you buy drugs today.

That's called crime. It happens today, and it will probably always happen so long as there are sociopaths in the human population. I'm less interested in wiping out crime, and more interested in making sure there isn't a privileged organization that allows its members to get away with crimes.
In the case of the rumors, the present-day is actually worse than your hypothetical scenario. It only takes one person to falsely accuse someone right now, and far more than 100 people are involved in making that person's life hell until the false accuser gets exposed.
To clarify, I was talking about crowdfunding an investigation, as in hiring the best investigator they can afford to stop the string of crimes. I didn't go into what happens from there.

It's a question of what you tell people.
If banks insist that depositing funds with them is 100% guaranteed and there is absolutely no risk, then failing to reimburse depositors is fraud.
If you're an employer and you tell your employees that they are 100% guaranteed to be paid for time worked, and that there is absolutely no risk in working for you, then you are engaging in fraud if you fail to pay them in that scenario.

Of course it matters what kind of money. With the federal government controlling money, for whatever budget the military gets fresh off the press, they get to spend it at the old price, before the adjustment to money supply inflation. So their dollars have more purchasing power than they do once they make it into the common person's pocket.
Police also trace some of their funding to the federal government, through grants to state governments who in turn run state police departments, and sometimes directly with earmarks like purchasing a military vehicle. These, like above, are "superdollars" in that they haven't circulated outside the government sector yet, and haven't caused market prices to adjust upwards.
This isn't possible with a currency states can't debase. If they had to collect taxes, then taxes would be even higher than today to compensate for them not spending new money first. There is no way they could sustain what exists today, and that's a good thing.
