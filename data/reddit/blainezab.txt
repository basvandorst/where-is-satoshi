I was going to say IPv4 compared to IPv6 in terms of “easier” but this makes more sense accuracy wise

ELI5: BIP39?
@_date: 2018-05-19 16:06:23
Makes sense, like a domain address over an IP
@_date: 2018-05-19 18:52:14
All I know is IPv4 is easier to remember when I’m typing stuff out ¯\_(ツ)_//¯
@_date: 2017-08-25 04:51:27
How is a receiving address going to benefit them anyway
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:30:59
Fair enough
@_date: 2017-08-03 17:20:38
Also, what is Ethereum and Litecoin? I'm assuming they're entirely different; is it worth paying attention to them?
@_date: 2017-08-02 19:28:25
Still on step one and I remember when it was $200 :(
@_date: 2017-08-27 02:38:23
This is actually pretty cool, r/privacy is one of my favorite subs. Can’t believe I missed this. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 08:06:16
I’m seeing $3240!
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:51:03
Yep same. My parents are being quite annoying about it.
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:53:30
That seems quite simple actually; what’s your favorite or a well trusted one? And I’m going to go ahead and assume apps exist for BTC yeah?
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:38:16
How do you keep them authenticated to yourself? From what I understand there isn’t a major database, so you just have to find a walleting service you like and doesn’t fee a lot?
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:11:18
So what’s happening on August 1st then? :o
@_date: 2017-07-29 03:14:23
Not quite (go to 3:00)
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:25:35
I wish I could easily mine and get into all this, I have a 1070 SC and a Raspberry Pi as far as tools : ^)
Jokes aside with the Pi, I’ve built this PC so I well understand computer hardware and am understanding the command line and whatnot more, even though that probably won’t help too much I imagine it can’t hurt at all. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:14:04
So this is a good thing then? (Saw the other comment first so I’m going to assume that might be something else?)
@_date: 2017-07-18 04:53:23
I realize this’ll likely get overlooked, sorry for taking up your guy’s feed and all, I’m just interested. 
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:22:01
So basically make sure everything is “compatible” by then or..not so good things?
^^also ^^I’d ^^like ^^some ^^~20% ^^extra ^^efficiency
@_date: 2017-07-18 05:33:00
I suppose I stepped in at the right time then. 
How can I get more involved in this? I’m (unfortunate timing) going to NYC later today so I won’t be able to access my PC for a week to try to get into mining and whatnot :/
