Why reboot for a update to bitcoin core? 
@_date: 2012-06-01 00:41:19
I second this statement. Mining on a laptop is a bad idea.

Open source does not equal public domain. Bitcoin is licensed under the MIT License with has rules about its use that do not exist in the public domain.

Where are you getting that first number? According to [the Chinese government]( there are 1.3 billion people in china.

I just sold all my screwdrivers for a 50% loss and spent all my savings on hammers. What now?

I have used this service to buy a HardDrive from Amazon. Was fast, easy, and reasonably priced. Will use this service agian. At least until Amazon accepts bitcoins flat out.

Current estimate is an increase of roughly 66% ([source]( and while that could increase another 44% before the next retarget at 124991, in 229 blocks, I doubt it will change that significantly. Anything is possible though.

Perhaps that 25,000 that was supposedly stolen? Hmmm...

Not everyone who studies the ethics of privacy fills privacy is ethical important or is an ethical person themselves. Not that I think either of those things are true about this person. Just saying.

That is a really good deal. If I didn't already have 50 times as much spaces from trading as I need I'd think about doing this!
@_date: 2011-12-01 14:34:14
Perhaps I misunderstood you. I thought you meant you'd give out your mining power to the public when you said, "somehow make my power public". 
I was not implying you'd try to break the system, I was saying you'd use all that power to mine blocks and make money, just like anyone would do.

Haha... sure you would.

I will match your payout in this endeavor.
Perhaps we should have a or something.

I run World Community Grid via BOINC on my CPU when it is idle and I run a bitcoin miner on my GPU. WCG can't run on my GPU and CPU mining is worthless, so I get to do both without worrying about either conflicting with the other.

What show?

When you gonna start charging? :-)
@_date: 2011-05-18 13:35:10
I mine for bitcoins while I game with a single card, most miners allow you to set a frame rate you'd like the computer to maintain and the miner will behave accordingly. However, if you don't think this will be good enough for you then simply tell the miner which card (0 or 1) to use and it will happily mine away on that card without bothering the second card.
However, I see that you have a ATI and a Nvidia card. I am not sure how well these two cards drivers will play together.

The allure of money?
@_date: 2011-05-24 23:26:32
My issue with this piece was more that they focused so much on how it could be used illegally and not on how it's different from fiat currencies. But, any press is good press, I suppose.

Buy computers and/or computer hardware. Possibly even with Linux pre-installed.

I think cats are cool, but not my favorite. Too small.

It's a hint at the correct answer. ;-)

Don't worry, you will get plenty of practice while you try to guess my favorite animal.

Your favorite animal? Why would I want that? I want a picture of MY favorite animal. Here is the catch. You have to guess it. :-D
Let's make this more fun. Total prize for a drawing of my favorite animal is 25 dollars. Each good guess (A guess which is closer than any of the other before it) will get a dollar from the 25 dollars. Who ever guesses correctly will get whatever remains from the pot at that point. Sound like fun?
We have a winner. Congratulations to @_date: 2013-12-04 22:53:28
Thanks for trying. But not close enough. Try something between a bear and a sloth.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:21:35
Nope. Too domestic.

Does it always round up? If I buy 1.2 Liters can I pay the price of 1 Liter?

But now we have reddit!
@_date: 2013-12-04 14:45:04
I agree that it is very cute. But not my favorite. Also not a drawing. I am starting to think you don't really want any Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-12-04 17:22:15
That's not a horse. Anyway, too tall.

Sorry, turtle is the second furthest from correct of any guess so far. Try something furrier.

Is that graph the number of sales or the revenue? Which ever it is, could you show us the other?
