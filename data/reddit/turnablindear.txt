It's important to note that dreamers are a specific class of immigrants.  They came to the US not of their own choice but their parents.  Having grown up in the US they are culturally American and have no significant ties to their country of birth.

Can you clarify? Your sale has to be BELOW your basis if you want to do the ol' sell low.
If you sold at a loss, and then repurchased BTC, you probably can't claim the loss.  The [wash sale rule]( probably applies.

Money will not be "pumped in" to BTC until the futures are sold off.  CME and CBOE BTC futures will be cash settled.  No BTC will be exchanged when contracts are bought and sold.

Not that you would want to travel there right now but if you are from the US it is extremely difficult to even get a visa from Venezuela.  A couple years ago I was considering going there. Things were bad then, but not like they are now.  The difficulty in getting a visa was the nail in the coffin to that idea.

Altavista was the bomb in its day.  It's cool that it was just a side project too.

Dude.  Fees ARE jigh.  I'd like to see the day when we can actually USE Bitcoin for day to day transactions.  A lot of us do.  Ignoring this issue and saying hodl isn't a solution.
It's not a currency unless we can use it as such.

It's not bandwidth.  The database is stored in a way which requires a lot of random writes.  Take a look at your drive's tps.  It's maxed.  Put it on an SSD and the initial download will be fast.  Then move it over to a mechanical drive or even an sd card.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:37:28
The biggest bottleneck is disk.  Look at your drives tps when you are doing the initial sync.  It has to do a lot of random writes.  It's honestly not an issue of bandwith, cpu, or ram.  Do the initial sync on an ssd and it will fly.
@_date: 2017-08-31 14:28:11
Run an **iostat 5**.  What's the tps on your drives?
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:31:37
Or run in prune mode.  No need for an external.  Do the initial sync to an SSD on a desktop and it's fast.  Prune and move it to your pi's sd card.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:41:44
Do you need to [port forward](

Formatting output like this makes it a lot easier to read:
    Device:    tps       kB_read/s   kB_wrtn/s     kB_read     kB_wrtn
    sda          94,40   8081,60     85,60         40408        428
    sdb          11,20   825,60      2,40          4128         12
So tps:     94,40
    avg-cpu: %user %nice %system %iowait %steal %idle
             2,86  0,00  0,65    28,57   0,00   67,92
That's what I was thinking.  You aren't writing that much data.  85kB per second.  You are doing about 100 transactions per second so with the high iowait, your drive is spending most of it's time moving it's read write head back and fourth.  If you sync to an SSD you should complete the download very quickly 
There is a myth that downloading the bockchain is CPU and bandwidth intensive. Unless you are syncing on a single core raspberry pi, this simply isn't true.  It seems to be extremely io intensive though.  Probably due to the structure of the database.
As an alternative to an SSD, you already have a copy of the blockchain, right?  I've not used bitcoin-qt but with bitcoind you can copy an already downloaded copy of the blockchain to a new instance.  Simply make a copy of **~/.bitcoin** in **~/whatever** and point the new instance of bitcoind to the new directory.  It might work with bitcoin-qt as well.

This looks like a gold mine.  Thank you!
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:01:50
That's surprisingly fast.  What model disk are you syncing the block chain to?

One of my drives was showing 250 tps.  That's 4ms per transaction on a drive with an average seek time of 7ms.  Thrashing.

There are a bunch online. [This]( looks pretty spot on.  It's really no different than compiling the latest version on any other system.  Basically:  Get Raspbian Lite up and running, Install the listed dependencies, git clone bitcoin, compile, install, run.
Do the initial sync on your desktop with an SSD.  Or even the pi with an SSD. 
 Prune the database (save a backup) and move it over to your pi unless you have a 256GB card.  Don't do the initial sync on flash.  It will take over a month.
That tutorial says to install some qt libraries and BerkelyDB.  You don't need either unless you want to run a wallet.  Which just don't on a pi.  bitcoind will automatically compile without wallet support. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:29:39
Doing the initial sync to an SSD will speed things up enormously.  It's not so much the quantity of data that is downloaded but how it is written to disk.  The blockchain is apparently stored in a fashion which requires a lot of random writes. This is very slow on a mechanical drive.  Take a look and you'll see 200-300 transactions per second on a good drive.  It's just maxed out.
Once you have it downloaded you can move it to a mechanical drive and use the SSD for something else.  It actually runs just fine off an SD card.  No biggie.
@_date: 2017-08-13 00:18:38
You will be fine.  I'm running on a single core of a RasPi 3.  Run in prune mode and you only need 2GB of disk after you verify the blockchain.

I'm not mining with a CPU.  I'm looking for a quality supported reference implementation written in C.

Interesting.  Do they have any formal statements on ach transfers between a fidelity brokerage account and Bitcoin exchanges?  I've been a customer forever and have been moving money through an intermediary account I don't care about.  I'd hate it if fidelity closed my account.

Unfortunately, Bitcoin already is already primarily an investment. Look at this sub.  People here just hodl instead of use.  Newcomers come here specifically to "invest".  Not to learn how to use Bitcoin or discuss making the technology more usable.
For most, buying Bitcoin is a speculative investment that sometime in the future it will have real value in our day to day lives.  It's sad.

It's tempting to trade just a single coin for $10k just to see some ball eating.

Mainer here.  This guy is a shit bag who became governor by winning 38 percent of the vote.

If you really are doing this, and this just isn't a thought exercise, don't.  Get a checking account which offers to refund ATM fees and get your euros that way.  If you are in the US check out Schwab.  No foreign transaction fees too.

Has fidelity said anything specific about Bitcoin?

Isn't that why we have reference implementations?  They exist more or less to rip off and be the target of our bitching.  Why reinvent the wheel?  Why introduce a fork or entirely new codebase unless its truly needed.?

LePage's first term was won with 38 percent.  His second was 48 percent.
Neither win was a majority.

Your 401k doesn't offer a short term bond fund or money market fund?  That's honestly shocking.  And if true, it's your employers fault.  Not the government's.

[Fibonacci Retracement](

Maduro doesn't really seem interested in attracting any investment in his econemy.  It looks more like he is trying to intentionally sabotage his economy.  He fired half the workforce at the state owned oils company and chased off international investors like Exxon.  With price controls there is no incentive to import *anything* and investors can't make a profit selling domestically manufactured goods because everything would be sold at a loss.
Venezuela has the largest oil reserves in the world.  They won the lottery.   To grow their econemy all they need to do is lease oil fields, collect royalties, and accumulate one of the world's largest sovereign wealth funds.

In March I actually ran into a former head of the Central Bank of Bolivia in a supermarket in Cochabamba.  He has strong ties to the US, I'm obviously American, so we chat.  As we say good bye he pulls out cash to pay for his groceries -- US dollars.  Like WTF?

Make a copy of your wallet.dat and place it in a convenient location.  It's encrypted with your passphrase so store it in a convenient place.  Store a copy of your wallet seed in a secure place.  Anyone with this seed can regenerate your private keys so keep it safe.
@_date: 2017-07-21 09:29:52
This will get downvoted to hell but it doesn't sound like this is ethical.  It doesn't sound like you can compare this to finding money on the ground.
Just because you find an unencrypted wallet on one of these drives doesn't mean the owner doesn't also have a copy.  Containing bitcoins they intend to use.  A better analogy would be how would you treat an unencrypted password to a bank account.  Would you assume that someone had abandoned their bank account because they left their unencrypted password lying around?  Why is it any different to assume someone abandoned their bitcoins because they left their unencrypted private key lying around?
If you work at the school where these students went to its even more unethical.  You would be using a trusted position at your employer to steal from their customers.

It's unfortunate there are a lot of sarcastic comments in this thread.  There definitely ways to help change your behavior around Bitcoin.  Explain your situation to a clinical social worker or psychologist.  If it's not in their wheelhouse they can refer you.  Psychologytoday has a find a therapist tool.  I've used it myself.

The safe deposit box has to go through probate.  A capable executor is chosen by the deceased.  A 12 year old child won't be talking custody of anything.  Fire and flood are definitely a concern but in the case of digital assets a backup can be stored at a second bank.  Burglary of a proper safe deposit box stored in a bank vault is *extremely* rare but is a risk.  However, it can't be compared to storing coins on an exchange.

Thank you for this.   After doing some more reading I have a better idea of what is paper wallet is.
@_date: 2017-06-06 01:43:05
What's wrong with relying on physical security for passwords?  A piece of paper in a bank safe deposit box.  If you are concerned about fire or flood, use two banks.
Keep in mind that whatever you have in the safe deposit box will likely have to go through probate.

If litecoin eventually becomes the crypto currency for everyday use, why would Bitcoin remain as a store of value?  Most people would rather store their money in a form which is readily usable.  I'm not particularly familiar with either currency which is why I ask.

What is the advantage of a paper wallet over using a deterministic wallet and stashing the seed?  I probably don't understand what a paper wallet is.

Coinbase charges fees to all credit card users don't they?  Irrespective of where the card was issued.  Though they may differ.  Only US based ACH transfers are free I think.
