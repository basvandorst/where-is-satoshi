This Abra wallet is really giving me a headache. I see my transaction on the blockchain wallet already confirmed and everything but my Abra wallet doesnt reflect the bitcoin funds sent to me. Ive emailed support for the past 2 weeks already and they bsically said the same thing, "we recognize the problem and are dealing with it".
Any one have any suggestion on how to have those funds reflected on my wallet? I want them out of Abra asap

I dont know who paid that but it wasnt me. My broker (bitflyer) charges a flat rate of 0.0004btc (yes I did get the decimals right) and the recipient wallet got a full 1.15Btc.

Took me less that 6$ to send over 12000$ in less than 20min. I mean, just get segwit enabled wallets...

Not really a lucky transaction. I've been sending out btc for the past week (Around 5 in total) and theyve all had the same fees and similar confirmation times. 
Doens't have to be everyone switch to segwit at the same time, but  instead of people complaining about tx fees and wait times, they could just switch to a segwit enabled exchange and have a segwit enabled wallet. Wouldnt that make the world a better place?
