Why would you want BTC to be niche? Isn’t that the opposite of the point?
@_date: 2018-08-09 22:32:07
That’s entirely accurate. Doesn’t nullify my losses does it? For all I knew the price could have went up even further. That’s the gamble. 
@_date: 2018-08-09 16:20:31
I definitely care. I’ve lost 60%. 
@_date: 2018-08-10 06:03:54
I never left.

What is the significance of these charts? Do they follow a pattern established by successful stocks or companies?

Way to kick a man when he’s down

Not that I disagree with the sentiment, but why does gold value matter when his aims to potentially replace it? If people don’t believe in gold as a standard monetary value, it doesn’t matter how much that all adds up to if there’s no belief in the system. 
I think the simple matter of how many people are just in this to make money is why it won’t ever reach crazy heights. We can’t all get rich, and if we did, it would probably just adversely affect the economy anyway.

Odds are that the second I sell, prices will explode. If you wanna pay me off, feel free and I’ll jump ship. 
@_date: 2018-10-01 09:34:25
Guess I’ll dump all my savings in then 
@_date: 2018-06-08 14:23:58
I’m down at least 50 because I bought in at ATH like a mug. 
@_date: 2018-06-07 13:02:19
Did you lost?
@_date: 2018-03-22 13:38:31
Shits been looking bullish since the January crash. I’ve yet to see this bullish news make a blind bit of difference. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 19:33:46
Thank you. Seems exciting. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:47:53
4 months in and still 40% down. I’d say I’m enjoying the ride but that would be a lie. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 14:59:15
At this point I don’t even care about gains. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 07:07:50
Bit late
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:50:19
Woops. Wrong discussion lol. Having a similar discussion elsewhere. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 13:23:31
Which big meeting? Been in hiding until the market recovered. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 09:16:29
Keep on fighting the good fight. Don’t let anybody stop you from being the best human you can be. These downvotes cannot stop you on your quest. 
@_date: 2018-04-25 15:36:13
As I said, I don’t care about gains at this point. All I care about is breaking even and at least maintaining that for a while.
It is what it is, and I’m prepared for it to go entirely, not a huge loss. But still, would like to feel some of the excitement that I unfortunately missed out on. Still holding, and buying.

We’re reaching a new level of references

Haha. If you cry now, you’ll be suicidal later. 
@_date: 2018-12-04 14:24:23
Don’t see the option on the app. Where is it?
