Sounds like a good plan.
My scenario is that I'm a minor, and can't have a credit card. Using Bitcoin will allow me to make purchases at my own discretion without having to use a Visa gift card that I get for my birthday (for online purchases), if I get one, or cash, which is also sparse for me. Using Bitcoin would allow me to make most of these purchases without having to ask if I can use one of their credit cards.

Why do you hate it?

None taken. The thing is, my parents are pretty smart people, I wouldn't say they watch too much TV, they just have only been exposed to what the rest of the population has, the bad side to bitcoin.

Thanks for the welcome and the infographic!

I realized that with the creation of this post. Everything that everyone is saying is incredibly preachy and some sound like morons.

About your last question, I don't really know. 
I think that I might talk to them again now about Bitcoin and tell them what it is and why it is better than normal currency (and why it is more useful to me than normal currency in some instances).

You can use a lower fee but it will get verified much much slower.

Sounds like fun. I'd never really do that to my parents though.

I'd be more willing to bet that it would be logistic growth than exponential. Exponential assumes that there is not a limited number of people to adopt bitcoin, but logistic growth assumes that there are. Logistic growth assumes few early adapters, many adapters in the main adoption phase, and few late adapters, who will be the most resistant to using bitcoin.

That is an incredibly good point that I should make.

Sorry I meant why he hated him.

I haven't, and definitely will. If you need to do deployment/implementation tests, I'd bet would be more than willing to test it out.

Its great that this will eventually be able to be decentralized, could be done with some sort of bittorrent protocol, I think I've seen video sharing/streaming done that way.

Probably meant to write 30% +/-.
