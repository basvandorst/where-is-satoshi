Tried shapeshift yesterday, it returned 85% of my btc as refund and seemed to have lost the rest. It said exchange was ok though but no XMR was sent. Output of screen was clearly a bug. Mailed them but would take 2 weeks before I’ll even get an answer. 
Trying Bisq now, seems more transparent and it’s P2P. Will get back with final outcome on this.

Which version of Electrum is the wallet in? If you open the file, do you only see encrypted characters or do you see some structure (json, with { })?
In the latter case, you can share the first half of the seed safely for other people to crack without having access to your wallet.
About which amount are we talking? I'm doing a recovery service for a percentage of the gains, but the resources cost money so of course it needs to be worth the investment. If interested, PM me for the details.
The needed part of the wallet would be sth like:
"seed": "fmPKakcXtXZ+kibLdcEKDszE1ve8qDKJtXujvuJvAE6oNLqGZUl8tqErbvApA4B66gDm3..cut offf last part"
If the wallet is fully encrypted, you have no choice than to send the full file untouched to any recovery service.

I’m a bit of a technology fan, but would never get this. As fun as it would seem. For same reason I threw out the Google home. Privacy is important and can not be retroactively enforced. Therefore be careful to go along in these ‘fun’ gadgets before you regret it.

How does the file look like? If it’s from 2015 it should be json. You can safely tell only the first 3 characters to give us an idea. 
Assuming it’s json (starting with { ) there is a part which hold your seed. Now this can be either encrypted if you used a password or plain text. If it’s not encrypted you can create a new wallet in electrum, import seed and copy this one there to recover. 
If it’s encrypted you have a chance to crack it if the password is small or easy. If it’s like 12 random characters password you are out of luck. 
I’d like to help but if you do not understand the contents of the file it’s too dangerous to publish parts here. And without knowing what you see it’s difficult to help. 
My advice would be rather to learn about it or if you have a knowledgeable friend to assist you (in person). 
If you would need help cracking a password, I can help though. At that point we could work with what’s called the half seed so you don’t disclose the seed.

The best is to boot an offline pc with tails. This is a safe OS that does not write to disk, you load it with a usb stick. There you have an electrum wallet to create or import your mnemonic and you can verify the addresses. I suggest to there export the public master key, this way you’ll be able to monitor the wallet from your hot pc, and be sure to use correct addresses to send the bitcoin to. This will also help you to not reuse a single address, which is better for your privacy. 
As stated by others you could use a dice to generate keys (you should do it for a mnemonic though), this is of course very good but more complex to do and I trust the electrum generation on tails enough. However you generate, use tails to verify.

Don’t let someone else do this! Please. I saw your post on the google doc as well, you need to understand your mnemonic is THE key to your funds. Nobody else may see it. 
So, buy a metal stamping kit for a few dollars and do this yourself. 
Start with a fresh wallet that you preferably generate from an offline device. Do not have copies of the mnemonic lying around.

I wonder what your insurance would say if you would claim this as a loss
@_date: 2019-07-29 19:06:13
At first it seems a solid plan, but 5% annually is really not worth the risk imo. You can loose 100%, which is minimum 0.5 BTC. 
You’d better risk trading once a year to have that 5% profit in 1 day if you are really desperate. 
So many things can go wrong and they’re only insured for 5% of their bitcoin holdings via their exchange. I agree with the ‘not your keys not your bitcoin’

I’ve had this when using windows professional. One good tip I can give you is to allow only local LAN connections in Teamviewer at the garage pc. Then you can connect using the local up number instead of a teamviewer id. This way traffic is NOT routed through the internet and team viewer servers. 
It also protects you from anyone else getting connected via teamviewer.

Indeed op lacks knowledge. Maybe read the bitcoin standard to understand sound money and where bitcoin is going. Meanwhile don’t buy bitcoin and regret later. 
One thing is true: it is not fully adapted as currency yet. Therefore Bitcoin is in price discovery and just like other valuable assets (eg stocks) you can expect some volatility. This is nothing bad but just how markets work. That does not mean it won’t stabilise and become *the* global currency one day - it will.

You’re right I made a typo there. This should have been 0.5mBTC, corrected now.
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:27:39
 &gt; all data : check the volatility as from 1974 before some stabilisation. Still, lots of fluctuations, but still considered a good store of value. 
It’s normal, we are still early and in price discovery. With so many potential upside you cannot expect a linear rise. 
And yes, in the future bitcoin may still rise very much vs fiat, even after being adopted as money, just like gold did in the last 20 years. But that won’t be bitcoin rising but fiat becoming worthless. One day the value of an egg in BTC will be rather stable imho.

Seems logical since mining gets more efficient with newer chips. I’d love to see a graph based on power consumption (would need to estimate the average power/hash based on some known facts and assumptions at each point in time). Is there any such graph out there?

I believe it was Saifedean that mentioned in his book the energy put in mining should be solely for that else it looses its property of securing the network. I think because of the energy is not ‘lost’ there is more incentive to try and attack the network. 
Logically however, I think this idea could still happen to recover the heat but as a consequence, as mining becomes more profitable the hashrate will go up until beyond the point of the profitability (no more demand to recover the heat), making the savings zero in the long term. 
Few other thoughts I have: mining is not constant enough, depending on the seasons; equipment outdated quickly making investment too large?

For the purpose of long term holding, I believe a ‘paper’ wallet IS the only way to store it. With paper I mean stainless steel. 
A HW wallet is useful if you still want to spend, and should anyway have a backup of the seed on the same kind of paper / metal plate. 
While safely generating the wallet, you export the public master key for viewing the wallet on any device, so there is really not any advantage of a HW wallet imo.

Yeah I get your point and agree it will help memorising it. But the idea to trust only your memory seems crazy to me, and to expose your mnemonic by making countless copies would make me feel even worse. 
I literally burn any temporary copy I make of mnemonics, and even take care the pressure through the paper doesn’t create a second unwanted ‘copy’. Maybe I’m paranoid ��
@_date: 2019-07-08 12:09:59
I do not believe we will get to the point that we have too little indivisible bitcoin. As value increases, less bitcoin will get lost as it becomes more important to keep them safe. It can’t be proven but I’m convinced most lost bitcoin stems from the days people just experimented and the value was too low to engrave seed words on steel, buy hardware wallets (not existing yet) and so on. 
Still, your proposal could still make sense to get a broader distribution. But that’s where I have a problem: at the moment an old utxo becomes ‘available’ the miner of that block gets ALL bitcoin in your proposal, which could be worth billions. This becomes a lottery for miners and is not quite fair for the community. 
So while I think your solution is for a non-issue, I believe redistributing these could be worthwhile if it is to distribute it fairly. However to do so I have not seen any viable proposals.

Only if you have an easy to crack password. A good password will encrypt your seed /mnemonic, that’s what the password is for. 
The 12 word mnemonic is indeed everything you need to get access to al derivated addresses, so keep it safe.

You posted this scam already one week ago ( Do you need new victims?
Even if the split key works, this will trick noobs into giving away their keys. Tried with a simple string in the non-explained split key field and it just generates a simple address with corresponding key which the site totally has control over. 
Hence, again, **this IS a scam. DO NOT USE!!!**
@_date: 2019-07-26 14:28:22
True but it’s because of the complexity. The devs are doing a lot, you can now use it on a ledger device. 
Apart from the potential grow, there’s another good reason to diversify with Monero: you never know what your gov will do so having at least a small part of your crypto asset in a decentralised privacy coin seems like a good insurance. 
True about the pony, but did you know Ripple founders kept 60% of all XRP for them from the start. I do not understand who wants to invest in that. Monero seems to be fairly distributed in that it was not premined and, just like BTC, everyone who supports it was mining from the start.

Cold storage means offline storage, so definitely no app (except for key generation if you want). 
While a hardware wallet is useful, I tend to think a HW wallet should be used as your spending wallet and real cold storage is an engraved stainless metal plate buried 6ft deep (or similarly safe) for hodling. 
There have been tons of similar topics here, so give it a search. My advice is to run tails from usb, generate a mnemonic in electrum on tails and put that mnemonic in steel in a safe place. Export the public master key to keep track of your wallet and addresses.

If you won’t forget the password it’s even better to not write a hint. Instead make a small deposit on the seed without the password. 
If someone steals or finds your seed they will likely not even try to brute force a password because they found ‘the’ funds and won’t guess there’s a second wallet. 
That being said, I would not trust my own memory enough so I’m not using a password.

The fact that electrum is SPV has nothing to do with the private keys. Private keys are deducted from the seed phrase only. Even offline. I see no reason why one would take the risk of custom encryption of raw keys (and if they really would they can do the same on the seed). Your seed, your bitcoin.

I'm giving up. Spent way too much time already. I'm publishing what I have so far.
image 
image without the Z-lines: 
excel 
Important assumptions I'm taking currently (that could be wrong):
-X (notdef symbol) is startpoint
-half of the picture is not relevant
-division into segments
"To triumph, one must look within. To infinity, and beyond. When you are close to home, X marks the spot."
=&gt; look within = in circle
=&gt; the NOTDEF symbol is home, hence starting point
=&gt; home to inifinity symbol cuts circle in half. 
=&gt; Beyond might mean you need to look a bit further, this crosses z=24
"You can throw out at least half of the words in the picture"
=&gt; The above line (X-&gt;infinity) slices image almost diagonally, where my assumption is the lower half is the only relevant one since almost all hints are there
"Think in pairs"
=&gt; Since there is z=0 to z=11 I think these are 12 solutions, and there are 12 paired solutions to combine to 24 words. However, not yet found the magic link.
"Code easily, attack early"
=&gt; tilt your head so you see the usefull half. Code-easily goes LEFT-RIGHT, attack-early goes UP-DOWN
=&gt; OR sequence orientations of words to find: down down straight up
"Lost transaction costs almost users"
=&gt; how to divide in segments: lost is startpoint, transaction is in left segment (2), costs is new startpoint, almost users split left (0) and right (1) segment
=&gt; alternatively, segment starts again from home
=&gt; look at orientation of 0,1,2: they could be the segments. Possibly take words from each segment in this sequence? Why only 8 digits?
=&gt; could also be the orientation of words, orientation as given by numbers 0,1,2
"Try +1"
=&gt; ?
"Almost open"
=&gt; open is the only word in the 'bad' segment. Maybe it's literally the checksum word? (it is aso next to the word SUM)
Failed attempts:
-listing words in order of radial distance from X (found only 21 words in lower half)
-starting from X, draw lines to each Z=0, Z=1 .., this often crosses exactly 1 BIP39 word every time but 0 for z=7 and multiple for 3 others
-drawing lines from number to number (0 - 1 - 2 -3..). This gives a very non-random drawing, often paired. There might be something to this, but it does not completely check out
-all words that are inside the B: I have 23 words but no order (ability come course entire fee gap help like main need one paper pool provide race rely speed split still system tail use way)
-many other failed tries :)

You want to invest with a window of minimal a few years. Then yes, now is the perfect time. We might or might not see a small dip first but on a few years most people expects large (x10-x30) gains. 
Coinbase is traditionally a good place to start, I like Bitstamp more though (cheaper fees too). 
If you are buying significant amounts, buy a hardware wallet like Ledger and withdraw them to that. It’s quite dummy proof.

Indeed, lost bitcoin will be anywhere in the curve so we can’t say this positively impacts the skewness. 
While the postulated numbers seem off, I believe it will more or less follow the Pareto power law: 20% controls 80% of wealth. There have been some attempts for finetuning like this article  but every analysis has their own flaws. 
Bottom line, yes distribution is skewed just like any wealth distribution in the world. The only thing you can do to correct this yourself is to buy more BTC from the whales now ��

While I agree, I also see benefits in having an as diverse as possible network of nodes. So in case of for example an OS-specific issue that can be exploited by lets say a DDOS, a part of the network has 0 impact. Same goes for other implementations besides Bitcoin core.
@_date: 2019-08-02 20:54:40
True, it’s global but it will still serve new data just not historical data once the cap is reached. So very useful for data limited connections but in your case I agree you could just ignore this.

I checked hodlhodl but the rates are stupid. The people there are asking 500-1000 more per btc
@_date: 2019-08-12 22:13:16
This will indeed be the easiest way to calculate. Of course it’s not fully correct but it’ll be close as price and mining costs are correlated (if mining cost is much higher than price, one better buys a bitcoin than mine it hence less miners hence low difficulty hence low cost. If cost is much lower, incentive to mine is bigger hence more miners hence higher difficulty hence cost goes up) It’s a natural equilibrium. 
Note I did not check how big the delta is on average. Be sure to post your final findings here, interested in the results.

Well there is the opportunity cost. I’ve placed fiat in an exchange and I am buying in daily with a bot. If I would have directly bought BTC at 4000k I would have made a lot more. That can be considered as a loss..
I’m not saying not to DCA but there are times where you know bitcoin can only halve in value but go tenfold up.
@_date: 2019-02-01 17:51:16
Sure this 610btc isn’t a Coinbase/other exchange wallet and you left it there? :)
@_date: 2019-06-24 10:19:09
Mistake: Trying to time market for small profits. 
Decided now to never sell anymore for short term gains. Only sell at crazy tops (next: 50 - 100 k) based on longterm trend. 
Buy in whenever you have spare money: at once when price is relatively low (full past year), DCA when price is relatively high like today. But don’t wait to buy the dip as you’ll probably fomo in at a higher price once it goes parabolic. 
Now that’s my theory, it still remains hard to stick to it :)
@_date: 2019-10-16 04:59:09
Jeez.. completely incorrect. Anyone having the seed can access your coins. The password is only meant to open a wallet file containing this seed. If your seed is compromised you need a full new seed.
@_date: 2019-10-16 05:21:58
You can actually have a second wallet on a Ledger using another pin, and a passphrase is added to the 24 words generating a full new seed. Please note in OP’s case this would not be the advice as one could find the second wallet through bruteforcing the passphrase of his words were compromised. 
This second pin is mostly useful for plausible deniability: when your forced to enter your pin you can use that of the small balance wallet and safeguard your main stack.

I don’t get the pricing though. It seems far more risky to sell BTC for fiat which can be counterfeit then to buy the BTC. Why ask more margin for the buy? Unless they’re anticipating a drop in price...

Bisq is p2p but there’s some serious limits on fiat when you have a new account. Nevertheless, you could start using it with smaller amounts.

I had the exact same question today. Bisq seems the best option I know of but I’d like to see more options at an honest rate. 
ATM’s here vary from 5 to 10%..
Also I prefer options that are not offline with shady individuals like on localbitcoins :)
@_date: 2019-04-27 08:15:15
Some more details are needed: was it the Bitcoin core wallet or another, do you have encrypted file/seed.. if yes it’s likely crackable in weeks to months unless your uncle used a strong password, say 12+ random chars. 
Google for hashcat, works very nicely with a powerful GPU. 
If you still need help, I can try and brute it for a commission if found.
Edit: it’s not very clear from the post but if the issue is that you do not know where to find the wallet file, wallet.dat is a good first search. I’ve also seen scripts online that will dig through all files and check for private keys. (Ofcourse won’t work if wallet is encrypted)
@_date: 2019-04-23 17:57:15
Yes used it many times for BTC to XMR, this works perfectly. Don’t have experience yet with fiat to BTC though.
@_date: 2018-11-09 21:16:30
It’s not bip38 but seed encryption of electrum. Anyway, it indeed remains brute force. 
I can search electrum passwords at 400million per second, but with the given search space it would still take too much time. 
If you would have a bit more info (possible words, only second word in leetspeech etc) I would offer my services but this is probably a lost cause. But for the amount you have to win I’d invest in some serious equipment if I were you!
Edit: you can take a half seed and post it so everyone that wants can try to crack it without disclosing your full seed:

You could write a script using existing libraries that iterate over possible derivations and compare each with the address. 
But note, there are many derivation schemes, and also the address could potentially be at a very high index. 
The chances to find it are in practice probably quite good, but if the derivation was exotic you might also never find it. Hence you can not be 100% sure if it’s belonging to the seed unless you find it. 
@_date: 2019-01-30 13:03:50

Alice can only see what she ever sent.

Looking for a long term investment? Yes perfect moment!
But in my opinion you can accumulate at a slightly lower rate, see
If you’re not having any BTC yet, I would not dare to wait on the sideline though and invest now part of what you wanted to spend. Invest the remainder with dollar cost averaging during coming weeks and months.
@_date: 2019-05-22 21:15:45
The answer also depends on how you will get and use these bitcoins. It is expected there will still be big market cycles. Do you hodl or will you trade?
I did the calculation recently: if you have 5btc now which you sell at the next ath (eg at 100k$), and with this 500k you buy again the dip (eg at 30k), you’ll be able to multiply and this should be more than enough. 
If you hodl, just imagine the dollar amount you guess you need and you can estimate the needed btc based on the long term regression line..
So my personal guess for your question: 10btc to start and riding the market.
@_date: 2019-05-25 22:07:03

This. You can technically always send it back to the sending address but you’re never sure that it’s the person who lost it because of his mistake that will get back the funds.
