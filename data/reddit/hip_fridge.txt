Definitely.  You'll receive a PM that someone has tipped you, with the option to receive (or deny) the tip.  Click accept, and it'll go into a Reddit wallet created for your username that you access via the cointip bot.  From there, you can tip others, or move it to another wallet.

Actually it appears I'm still learning a bit, but thanks nonetheless! :)
Love your new piece, always a fan of interactive art.  Here's hoping I stumble across your work in person at some point.

Edit: Yep, looks like it's working.

You may already have this figured out, but just in case:
When you sign up for bitcointip, a new wallet address is generated specifically for your Reddit account, and viewable by PM'ing the bot.  This is where all your bitcoin tips from fellow Redditors go.  ~~If you want, you CAN change that Reddit wallet address to a different wallet address (say, one you already had before), but it's not required~~ (This is incorrect. I misread exporting your Reddit bitcointip wallet to a blockchain.info wallet - for accessing the coins in the Reddit wallet without logging into Reddit - as "changing" the Reddit wallet address, which it does not.  There currently appears to be no way to alter the Reddit bitcointip wallet address.)  In any case, a quick PM to the bot can withdraw whatever funds are in your Reddit wallet to your other wallet, no sweat.

Cheesy as it may sound, this realization actually made Bitcoins just a little more enjoyable for me.  I don't have enough BTC for a tip, so you get a verified Orangered instead.
