So they ask it and do your company give or not last year all informations? 
@_date: 2015-05-15 17:19:29


What they ask or are that companys secret? If your company have give all withdrawal informations and names/bank details and not even inform about that all your 25000 unique customers there will be really much shit in next coming months. Lot of students etc poor peoples who maybe have only mining and not even follow so much Finland scene that can know what have happen, they will lose lot of social security moneys rent, income support. If you are Finland biggest BTC company there maybe can think to have some kind of duty to tell users what are coming. Your site even not make any kind of news about that there is possible to get problems with taxman...

Is symbiont using XCP in someway, burn or something..
@_date: 2015-08-07 00:01:51
Counterparty, after last year counterparty-overstock news anyone not really have told what happen  :)
@_date: 2015-08-05 01:37:14
And ofc you can build over that own Symbiont. 
@_date: 2015-07-14 19:12:54
How else would you do this?
With side chains ofc,, after next summer. Counterparty is bad way because XCP is only one altcoin and there have already hundreds of altcoins.

Where you need NXT?
@_date: 2015-07-08 05:24:31
Counterparty have same Bitcoin network security and that is decentralized. 
@_date: 2015-07-31 01:06:43
Why you think OP are speaking about Ethereum? 
@_date: 2015-07-22 19:48:31
Because Counterparty are only another altcoin for dreamers :&lt; It is better panic buy later than with cheap price :D

If they try forbit to peoples choose I will join to battle and add 10 full nodes installing in my company servers. 3 are already downloading blockchain.
@_date: 2015-07-22 22:35:26

@_date: 2015-04-22 17:47:03

@_date: 2015-10-13 23:57:02
This have done already to Counterparty testnet long time ago if I have understood right. They are only waiting it is sure enough secure. Rootstock are rush and building something what is not yet 100% secure?
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:38:57
