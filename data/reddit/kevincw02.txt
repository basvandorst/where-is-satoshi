thank you.  I have yet to get someone on this subreddit actually show me the regulations which dictate AML/KYC regulations with are applicable to common transactions: 1) FIAT for BTC and 2) BTC for goods/services.  I think this is because they don't actually apply.
But why would a company who is a supporter of a bitcoin implement these?  My theory is this: 
The inventor comes up with a great idea and decides to implement it.  But he needs funding and sources it from venture capitalists, angel investors, etc.  
Those investors immediately think, BTC is volatile and thus high risk, I need to protect my money (I don't blame him)  Most investors have close ties to financial institutions because ofcourse they're in the business of providing money and therefore spend a lot of time dealing with banks.  So the investor naturally selects some risk management analyst he knows at a traditional financial institution to work with the inventor.
Now the inventor doesn't like this idea but he's got no choice, this is a condition of the funding.  The analyst immediately implements restrictions just as he has done in the past at banks and other financial institutions e.g. AML and KYC.  Do these apply?  He's not sure but his job to reduce risk and the more information you know about the guy you're taking money from, the higher the likelihood you can shift that risk to someone else if things go bad.
And this is how we end up with a BTC ATM that requires a phone number, passport, palm scan, drivers license scan and a 30 minute wait.  No one other than a very small percentage are going to take the time or risk to perform a transaction like that.  And you if you think the answer is to have some guy hawking localbitcoins whispering in the ATM user's ear is going to go down well -- think again.  If someone tries to interact with me during an ATM transaction, I get the hell out of there.
The op is correct that we need to resist implementing the copy/paste regulations from the traditional banks and we do that by working with the community to define what's actually required, publish and follow it.  If the regulatory authorities don't like it then they can help refine it.  And to refine it, they need to backup their requirements with actual applicable regulation.

that's not true, our fed chairman said it herself: "The Federal Reserve simply does not have the authority to supervise or regulate Bitcoin in any way."
Do you provide all those details when you buy a $2000 TV at best buy with cash?  You can easily re-sell that TV and launder the money on craigslist.  BTC, from the perspective of the gov't is not a currency, so it's just another good that you can buy and there's no regulation on identification needed to buy generic goods.

it's not so hard for me to imagine btc replacing fiat.  imagine you get paid in btc -- your employer will still take out income taxes and report the public address they paid the rest too and associate it with you.  Come april 15th, they know how much you received and they can even trace what you did with it.  
Are there people who will accept payment under the table?  Sure but that happens already and we're not in some downward spiraling chaos today are we (ok don't answer that)?

thanks alex.
phone - why is it the commercial btc payment processors don't require 6 confirmations (e.g. 5-10minutes) but you do?  Most agree the double-pay risk is near 0.  Do you know something they don't?  This will remove your requirement for a phone number.
ID scan - The bank secrecy act applies to banks, and I think we both agree your company is not a bank.  Additionally unless you return cash for BTC deposits, you're not transmitting money since BTC is not considered currency, it's property.  Example is buying a $2000 TV at best buy with cash and no identification.
Picture)Without the KYC requirement above, you dont need to know I am since I don't claim to be anyone.
Palm scan) same as above
I think we can agree it all stems from the applicability KYC/AML and I have yet to see solid evidence that they apply to BTC ATMs.  I understand your company may be risk-averse and feel that if you make an effort to do something then you're safe but I think that's a mistake for 2 reasons.  1) who's to say you've done enough until there is precedent or clear rules? 2) Your transaction rate will suffer -- especially new users.

Was honestly thinking I was the only one with a bitcoin payment issue at tigerdirect but after coming to this subreddit I was sad/happy to see I wasn't.  
Sad because it's obvious the bitpay/tigerdirect integration is not mature.  And also because it's clear as day that they didn't take the time to train their employees before launching.
Happy because there are so many people having issues that I'll hopefully have a large support group to get help from...since that's obviously not coming from tigerdirect customer support.
Anyways, here's a cross-post of my story:

I don't see the application.  A btc atm owner is not a bank and therefore kyc doesn't apply.  You're paying cash for something in exchange.

That page listed KYC requirements for banks.  BTC ATMS are not banks.  Accepting dollars for goods (which have value and which BTC happens to be) does not make you a bank.  
As an example, to help get it through your thick skull: If I pay $200 to the automated checkout machine to pay for my groceries I'm not required to spend 30 minutes providing my identity.

I don't beleive eBay can get into bitcoin because they have paypal.  I don't think paypal can get into bitcoin because it's a direct competitor.  A well-managed company does not provide conflicting services.  Paypal sells a payment method service and I argue that this the same thing that bitcoin and VISA/Mastercard/etc provide.  Each of the payment methods provide other services, but the overlap is there.  
Essentially if an ebay seller and/or buyer are given the option to pay/receive funds with bitcoin for &lt;0.5% fee or 3% fee, which are they gonna choose every time?

I dont think it's any different.  Uber requires a credit card which they check is valid (authorization) at the time of sign-up and periodically.  The same could be done with a btc address (blockchain balance).  Is there risk?  Yes, but the risk is the same for both.  In the worst case, Uber risk is equal to 1 fare and bans the user after that.

apple didnt actually develop the tokenized protocol, the cc companies did (emvco = amex, visa, mastercard, jcb, discover, etc).  they used apple to promote the idea.  apple's contribition is limited to the development of authentication for "cardonfile" and marketing (not a small task but also not the bulk of the work).

As a customer, especially one who has had a bad first experience, I expect a company to go out of their way to fix the problem.  If its true their bank is holding the queued submission, I would have appreciated an offer to escalate to mgmt to see if it could have be reversed.

Actually, gambling with bitcoin is not covered under present US "gambling laws".  Here's an exercept from a recent analysis done:
"So even though this Act does not prohibit the use of Bitcoins for iinternet gambling some casinos will not accept US customers just in case the law changes but as of right now, unless the government amends UIGEA to include Bitcoin or Bitcoin is regulated at a federal level to be included as a “money transmitting business” we can say:
 
It is definitely NOT illegal to gamble online with Bitcoins (yet)"

Brainstorming: 1) If the shipping address is in UK, the merchant calculates UK taxes and adds that to the cost in BTC presented to the customer.  
2) customer pays with btc and coinbase converts to USD fiat and deposits in merchant bank account  
3) Merchant pays their periodic sales tax to gov't 
Step 3 could be the problem.  Does the merchant need to convert USD to GBP and eat the conversion cost or can btc help here too?

I don't agree this is the majority.  There are giftcard-for-cash terminals in super markets now.  Gift cards are sold at a discount because the user wants liquidity.  The whole reason gift cards are marketed is because the vendors know there's a percentage of users who won't use all the funds.  Purse.io and fold are based on this principle.

This was an exploratory order and the amounts were very small.  You're correct that I could have checked the status of the first payment on the block chain.  What was confusing was that the amount owed actually changed between the first payment request and the second.  I actually did check the block chain after the 2nd payment of $0.1USD.  The third time was just to see what would happen which is when I got the $0 USD PR.

So it sounds like you 're arguing that the bitoin ATM and localbitcoin seller are equally as inconvenient.  If that's the case then I agree.  However, localbitcoins has the added cost which most argue is justified to maintain privacy.  However ocalbitcoins requires user verification and logs the details of the transaction along with the btc addresses and chat log.  So you're not getting much privacy for he added cost.  Its unfortunately much easier and cheaper to withdraw cash from a standard ATM.

significant computing resources are spent on maintaining the ledger of trades.  The state of the trades must be maintained in an atomic fashion.   The blockchain can be used as this ledger using op_return transactions on the blockchain (and possibly others).  Essentially the massive set of mining equipment maintained by miners and paid for with transaction fees and mining rewards saves them costs since they don't have to run a similar service.  Settlement time is reduced from days (2-3 typically) to minutes because the funding of trades (broker to broker) doesn't depend on the legacy banking system.
