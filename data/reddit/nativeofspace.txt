Well put. I think he/she will "think" what they're told to since the account is a day old and seems to be a knee jerk reaction or a shills opinion. Also pretty sure CNN has ratings that indicate they have far less than 5 million people watching their show at any given time, they're really not even a main stream source of news any more.

 I've heard a lot of people say that Bitcoin could replace fiat currencies (aka dollar/sterling/euro/etc.), but how is that possible if we need fiat currencies, or gold, to give cryptocurrencies value? A bitcoin might be worth 65 litecoins but unless either one has an actual monetary value then both are essentially worthless. Is this thinking completely wrong, is there an obvious answer I'm missing?

Oh, ok that's the issue here. Well there's no way to know what the market will do at that point but it will be interesting seeing as the supply will hit a wall then the price will have to rise astronomically for the currency to survive or be profitable to mine, no? This also makes me wonder why so many people are setting up petahash sized mines when the supply will hit the wall in a decade or so or will most large scale operations switch streams or already have? Sidenote: I recently discovered many cryptocurrencies are unminable or significantly premined, what do you think of the future of those? I personally think it would be hard to get a following behind any coin that can't be mined no matter how useful the code is. I still have a considerable amount of reading to do on blockchain, but those ones really didn't make sense to me. I also don't think there's enough analytical data on cryptos, there should be a currency strength score of some kind. I had a formula in mind earlier something like "(current dollar value / opening dollar value)/Days since genesis", does that vaguely make sense to anyone?

Well some crypto 2.0 coins or coloured coins are aiming to use the blockchain to transfer messages, hold contracts, or even files. This was really why I wanted to create a new coin and the metadata for that coin would be used specifically to store code for webpages. You can save some data or messages on the bitcoin blockchain so why can't you save code and have it read back out when it's called from a website? This obviously shows why I need to do more reading, but I thought one long string that can be translated back and forth into code would be the best way to transfer code on any sort of blockchain. If I could save a small message on the blockchain that said "hello world" why couldn't I also send a message like :
 &lt;body&gt;
 &lt;?php echo '&lt;p&gt;Hello World&lt;/p&gt;'; ?&gt; 
 &lt;/body&gt;
but instead translate it into base64 so it looks like:
Then call that data from a webpage and translate it back and just display it as:
Hello World

Wow, thanks that's a great answer. I know C and C++ are seperate I've just noticed pretty much all cryptocurrency source code is in C++ or it's suggested you should use C++ or C, also noticed some Java and Python implementations of Bitcoin and Litecoin. I also have very little formal education in programming and comp sci so I'm probably not using terms quite right or know the definition of what I'm talking about sometime. But once I've taken the time to learn everything in detail I'd just like to see what happens when you start to add or change different parts of the code. Probably not beneficial at all to most people or myself, just like messing with things. There's obviously no point in creating an altcoin that's basically just a copy-paste of an existing coin but I thought it would be fun to mess with one that other people won't be affected by or ever use. 
I basically want to work with the meta data, it would prob take me over a year to do but I want to see if I could take Html/css/php code and translate it into base64, save it as metadata, then access the metadata from a website and translate the meta data back to it's original form and shown it on the webpage. Maybe this isn't possible, maybe someone else has already tried or accomplished this but I think it would be worth trying. There's a few problems I can think of already but I wouldn't even start this until I had read everything I need to and probably figured out how it is or isn't possible. 
Other than that it should just be a lot of fun finding out what I can and cannot do with bitcoin. I was just hoping to be able to eventually create a currency that had more uses than bitcoin or litecoin. I'll definetly read through the links you had posted, I usually have to read this stuff through 3 times so 4 times couldn't hurt, I also found over 12 hours of video lectures about 5 minutes after my first post so I've got a lot of learning and fiddling to do before I can actually create something that has any usefulness to anyone.

I'm trying to start developing with bitcoin and blockchain technology in a few different ways, there doesn't seem to be much of a standard for developing with cryptocurrencies so far. As far as I can if you want to make a new cryptocurrency it's best to develop in C/C++ and there's a decent explanation out there for working with bitcoin in C but I can seem to find much explanation for how to work with everything at once or what is necessary to access a blockchain from an application. I want to work with web and mobile but also mess around with the source code for bitcoin and litecoin to create my own currency to mess around and test with. Any tips you could give me on getting started with blockchain programming?

How do you ban bitcoin but still allow banks to use blockchain technology to transmit dollars? How do you even enforce a ban on bitcoin? Lots of governments banned internet piracy, how did that work out? If CISPA has failed repeatedly then why wouldn't a bill to ban bitcoin fail too? Some people have a lot of money to invest in bitcoin, why wouldn't they also spend money to defend it?

My dad spent his career in banking and although he did well for himself it's no longer the business it used to be. Lots of people age 60+ are being made redundant or just hanging on so they can get a severance package. Based on the information I know, banks are looking to downsize massively in the next decade and are not looking to fill the positions that will become vacant. Technology is their biggest hurdle, most people know tech and banks don't mix well, it's too expensive to do business as usual and too many alternatives like bitcoin have come along to take a slice of the pie. Markets have also become too regulated to make a profit anymore and the banks that have managed to sidestep the rules are not going to be able to stay above the law for much longer, soon they'll be in just another profession and will become much more susceptible to legal prosecution. I wouldn't worry too much about banks looking at blockchain technology, they don't know what to do with it and their blockchains would not have the necessary developer support or rapid enough consumer adoption to succeed.

That's the general assumption though, are there and actual studies to back up any of that information?

Bitcoin halfing is in september so the price will prob syart to climb 3-4 months before that. I don't see much that would suggest the price will rise any time soon. It may recover before january but once we're into 2016 I think the price will gradually start, especially as we close in on the halfing.

This is all just based on my opinion from the limited amount of info I know or can give out, plus I'm not currently in banking myself so take from it what you will. I just know banks are spending tens of millions to accomplish the same thing that can be done with a blockchain currency, not to mention the cost to maintain the systems that are in place. Major banks are indeed running on code written decades ago, I know Reuters is not nearly as advanced as people may think. I have seen banks are quite interested in blockchain technology, if you were to search 'blockchain' in job databases you may find banks are hiring people to basically study it and explain things to investors. I think if they can create a successful blockchain product it's unlikely the end user will even know what they're using or interacting with is a blockchain. I would be interested to hear what people who are active in the banking/financial community think the future will be like for banks and blockchain technology, very difficult to get a good view of what is going to happen over the next few years.

How about we all stop caring what the banks are doing with bitcoin? They don't want to do anything to improve it, they only want to manipulate it to make money, this should be obvious. I'm far more interested in what developers can do with blockchain technology and the people who are pushing to legitimize it in the eyes of the public. Anyone who is interested in bitcoin/blockchain technology is highly unlikely to want to buy into a bank owned blockchain and the bank's core customer base is not made up of people who either understand or support bitcoin. If banks ended up using blockchain tech it will be to reduce the costs of transactions and the end user would not even know that blockchain technology was being utilized. Banks are not at the forefront of innovation when it comes to technology so they'll have to wait until someone else creates something that they can steal, which is exactly what they're trying to do with bitcoin. They may have the money to invest with but they don't have the ability to innovate.

Hijacking the top comment to shamelessly plug on my phone so I hope that works. I think finding the information necessary to work with bitcoin or other cryptos is really difficult right now, if you have anything you can share with other devs or can explain what setup you've been using so far to work with bitcoin or any blockchain based currency then please share it on the aforementioned sub. I plan to add more posts explaining some of the basics and how to start developing with bitcoin but I could use some help.

Well I guess they can then but unless you built the bot yourself you might not be able to, just guessing really. If you're trusting your coins to a trading program you would have to be sure you can keep track of which addresses are being used and where your coins are being sent, no? Personally I would want to use the same address for trading in case I accidentally sent coins to an address I don't own. I plan to buy the Haasonline trading program this weekend so hopefully I'll understand how everything works a bit better once I get used to things.
