Rex Tillerson has a huge ton of experience with foreign nations. And he knows how to handle maybe one of the largest companies in the world. And ten thousand times better then crooked Mitt.
Steven Mnuchin: Yeah sure he has a career at the corrupt Goldman Sachs but he knows how the system works, and you can't really put someone in charge of so much money without being the bank business.
James Mattis: "Mad dog" Do I have to say more? 
Dr. Ben Carson: I truly love this guy. He came off the streets and worked his ass of. He knows how it feels to live in the rough parts of town. And he has a great heart.
Reince Priebus: He's the connection between Trump and the Congress. You need someone who worked there to get things done efficiently.
I could go on and on but it's a pain in the ass on mobile. And I really reevaluate my life because I'm not even an American and I know more about your cabinet than my very own.

Look, you don't have to agree with me or my argumentation but Trump did not pick the same old corrupts in charge of power. Many of them weren't into poitics before.

I wouldn't be too fast with that statement. He picked very good people to help him. And Trump didn't had to do this. I think he has the best intention to change the things for the right direction.
