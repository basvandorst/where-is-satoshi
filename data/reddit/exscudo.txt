I still believe that the article is right though
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:19:35
Because people hate everything new and most are afraid of what they don't understand  At least deep down inside they are :)
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:37:57
Orange should be the new color for money. Green = USD ( bleh, who needs that ) orange = BTC.
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:36:54
He certainly didn't imagine this coming when pretending to be Satoshi. A great lesson for all future Nakamoto-wannabes.

@_date: 2019-08-16 11:43:49
So true!
@_date: 2019-08-28 14:38:28
Why would anybody stop obsessing about price when it comes to BTC? Obsessing about price is the best :)
@_date: 2019-08-16 09:39:31
If you got the money, honey we got your disease
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:06:20
It is so shiny... I like it
@_date: 2019-08-20 14:02:55
Wow, if something like this happened with my old fashioned bank I would instantly stop being a client, just saying.
@_date: 2019-08-16 12:17:38
Can you share how many payments in Bitcoin you've already had?
@_date: 2019-08-21 09:46:10
Oh, snap!
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:31:05
Though, it is uncertain whether Satoshi is the creator or "creators". Nobody knows if it's a man, a woman or a group of people.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:53:19
Is it though?
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:14:04
Memes suggest that it was.
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:28:32
This is the attitude we need in the industry! Any community centered around something inevitably forgets how difficult a concept maybe for a beginner and start becoming a little hostile. We don't want Bitcoin community to scare away newcomers, for example, as the skateboard community did at one point because of the notion of toxicity towards the noobs. We are all noobs at some point until we aren't!
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:38:04
The prices should become reasonable when they stop being a novelty and become the norm.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:44:14
Fast cryptocurrency payment solutions will play a major role for adoption, so good for them.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:45:46
I heard that they are switching from BitPay?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:26:16
Anything Bitcoin should be an easy task, but unfortunately, many people can't even wrap their heads about the concept of addresses and keys.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:55:39
It is funny how such a decentralized currency that should be completely independent is influenced by the very economy it was created to replace. Something's wrong here isn't it?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:24:06
How does one "destroy" a bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:40:34
They go to show that the advantages of decentralized monetary systems over traditional ones :)
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:27:49
Imagine a new era hippies voting for peace with bitcoin flags...
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:48:37
Bakkt is making a lot of noise but mostly in the form of memes depicting missing people on conferences right now, so I wouldn't worry too much.
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:13:52
Those were the times. Can't wait for something like this to happen again, but I doubt it will.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:46:58
Problem is that many people just don't understand why they would need bitcoin and don't know what to do with it now. The industry needs more material and products aimed at education of the general public.
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:23:59
That is completely true, Russian banks are known to have no privacy and give your data to the government with and without reason. Political opposition and even privat businesses can suffer from unfair blows coming from the competition with political connection. Blockchain could turn this around. 
Though, it is known that the particular politician from this article already collects donations for campaigns only in crypto.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:17:12
Do you guys think that regulations are a good thing for crypto as long as they make sense?
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:42:32
This is essentially what mining is. Electricity -&gt; machine -&gt; money.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:57:54
It is true that some people are here only because of the speculation. But even so, won't raising the general awareness benefit, everybody? There would be even more people trading, more volume, more movement...
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:34:02
"Bitcoin is used to buy guns, bitcoin is used to buy drugs, blah-blah-blah".
Here we are in the real world and people spend their bitcoin on quality locks while other bad people spend cash on drugs and weapons.
@_date: 2019-09-23 21:11:14
But they do know what gold is right? Bitcoin is a new technology, it is only natural that a lot of people don't know much about it yet. And it's up to us to educate them.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:51:46
It is not convenient, but you can withdraw your bitcoins in coinbase or some other exchange and pay with fiat.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:41:57
Every minute we spend in this space gives a positive impact on the whole market. Even if it's a tiny shift in stats like the number of adopters when enough of us start contributing this industry will take off to the next level!
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:44:40
Is there any statistics about hardware wallet hacks?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:29:01
You should accept DOGE. Just for the sake of being able to buy a chicken with a dog.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:39:35
A fraction of a digit at that.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:45:45
Cryptocurrency being established among the business community is sure to spread to the general public little by little, so it is great news indeed.
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:50:39
But don't you guys think that Bitcoin, in the long run, is seriously threatened by some of the emerging altcoins? Bitcoin was the first but it also means that new coins can improve on its formula.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:43:19
BlowStamp is a hilarious name, I've never seen this before.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:21:38
It is funny how they say "energy kitchen" and use bitcoin transactions which require tons upon tons of energy.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:16:10
Finally, graffiti is serving a good purpose.
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:12:58
The same problems persist in private banks, you are just never safe from government surveillance. There are also stories about people's accounts getting frozen left right and center in private banks. 
That said, of course, it is a government issue, they have way too much authority and banks simply can not provide a sufficient level of safety and privacy right now.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:46:33
I saw BitBay, read BitPay and immediately got a bad first impression. Just putting it out there.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:19:48
Hopefully, we will go over 11k in the next few months.
@_date: 2019-09-13 14:11:00
The more educational campaigns like this happen in the industry the better, that's for sure! Maybe in a few years down the line we will be seeing Bitocin banners on F1 race tracks!
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:20:55
Especially great to see this as it could be his own initiative rather than a sponsorship. And even if this is a sponsorship it is still great as it was not censored.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:38:45
Congratulations! Wonderful to see these popping up in more and more places. Which operations are supported by this one?
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:52:03
Gold has value for the same reason that Bitcoin or, heck, even rare in-game skin has value. It's all made up :)
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:45:22
Any value of anything is imaginative, why is Bitcoin any different? For instance, Russian RUB is backed by oil, what is oil backed by?
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:25:39
Bitcoin has already shown it's dependence on the economy so most likely it will experience a huge price drop.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:25:22
Blockchain can help in this industry as much as in any other. Transparency and distribution chain tracking seem to be the most beneficial areas.
@_date: 2019-09-23 17:38:26
Though, it is true that it is taking a very long time to develop. Chances are somebody will solve the problems they are solving before them.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:50:16
21 bitcoin does not seem like a whale :)
@_date: 2019-09-12 15:25:47
Whose sponsorship is this going to be then? Is Satoshi finally taking charge?
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:32:30
Any artificial pump is equally disappointing. Especially so when it fails.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:54:38
I though craigslist is just a sure way to get killed by a maniac during your purchase pick up. Now they also steal cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:35:47
How about the issue of relabeling prices every other second? We will start wasing not only electricity but also wood at that point and bitcoin will end the world :( 
P.S. just kidding of course.
@_date: 2019-09-23 19:26:51
Guys, do you use centralized or decentralized exchanges? What are your thoughts on this?
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:15:26
I have seen that there is one in Georgia ( the country, not the state ), which is a little-little country. Great to see them making their way into more and more places.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:23:20
This is a problem of general education which is solvable. With fake gold, one can scam even a knowing person under the right circumstances.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:49:48
Absolutely, some people wait for days. This is the thing with Bitcoin and low transaction fees.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:24:17
The easiest would be coinbase.
@_date: 2019-09-18 13:44:07
Exactly, with this kind of attitude, it is hard to see who exactly will be their userbase. They can't make crypto and be hostile to the crypto community at the same time.
@_date: 2019-09-23 18:18:41
Micro Bitcoin - that is funny. Is this in Latin America by any chance?
@_date: 2019-09-23 20:16:48
But in this case, the coin technically will continue to exist in the blockchain. Just found out this: [ 
There is a way to remove them from the blockchain completely after all.
@_date: 2019-09-12 08:56:21
If you have a day job and the employer offered to pay you in Bitcoin would you agree?
@_date: 2016-10-06 09:47:34
Agree, they can easily create some kind of their own 'bankcoin' or smth widely-used in their financial transactions between the bank accounts.
But then, it is clear that bankers are interested in blockchain rather than btc itself.
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:43:37
Chill, guys. It is clear, let me be your captain:
the point is that in the majority of countries monetary inflation is observed, and cash tends to value less over time. But there are such countries (as e.g. Japan) with deflation, where cash is valued more over time. Why? 
@_date: 2016-10-07 11:44:25
Quote, as follows: 'Economic occurrence where the inflation rate is negative and continuing to decrease. This occurs when prices and wages drop and slows inflation due to lower demand (and therefore, lower production). When this happens, the supply of money usually decreases, leading to a stronger currency which would fuel even lower prices and wages, thereby creating a chain of events. Deflationary spirals are often viewed negatively because they generally occur in recessionary times and tend to worsen the recession.'
