I find it surprising XRP gets all the bashing yet I have never seen any posts bashing XLM. Created by the guy who co-founded Ripple and Mt.Gox which stole everyones money. 
But yea, since XRP isn't a Bitcoin clone like 90% of other cryptocurrencies it must be fake. Guess they fooled even the exchanges since it can be bought on almost all of them.

Same thing they did to the precious metal markets. Been a few years but last I knew there were more paper contracts for gold and silver than what was actually available.

I'll play. So what other cryptocurrencies become as successful as Bitcoin?
@_date: 2019-07-31 21:23:33
That is correct and also where i see the problem with contracts if they decide to exceed what is actually available. If there's only 21m BTC but there's 50m BTC contracts it could lead to price suppression such as with precious metals. I could be wrong though and perhaps certain rules will be put in place to maintain BTC's finiteness.

Always wanted to hear the stories of those who were liquidated. Best advice I've ever been given since getting into crypto is make sure you cash out your initial investment, i would recommend you do the same.

This type of ideology encouraged me to not sell when I was up 800k lmao

Pretty sure it went to 14k for a second on Poloniex but I'm not gonna argue over it. The fact that he/she saw such a big rise coming but sooner than expected is still pretty impressive.

Pretty sure it went from $20 to $150 not too long ago...
@_date: 2019-10-24 14:35:57
Still hit 14k slightly before October so I'd say he was pretty spot on.

At least you got to enjoy the money for a bit. Kinda had the same thing happen to me with regards to euphoria. Got into ETH at $10 and XRP at less than a penny but didn't sell at the tops except to buy a house, new car, and to help sister buy her first home. Now I'm back down to my initial investment hoping XRP and GNT pay off. Otherwise, not sure if I'll be able to maintain my current lifestyle. Just grateful i didn't quit my job back then.

Google helped fund Ripple/XRP if I'm not mistaken.

Yea i miss those days. Being a US customer prevents me from being able to lend but for months in a row i was bringing in 500 XRP every 3 days. Whales eventually started suppressing the rates across the board with the exception of BTC which would still pop to 1%+ which was delicious.

Was almost 70% in April 2017. Total crypto market cap was only $30 billion then.

Opps, wrong /r. Took it literally.

Just a practice run for the meteor/comet landings. That's where the money will be.

Cognitive dissonance

Just because it isn't profitable now doesn't mean it won't ever be.

Last time I saw those popping up at every corner in my home town gold shot up to 2k soon after.
@_date: 2018-11-29 11:47:00
Sure they aren't just buying contracts? I.e. not the (physical?) Bitcoins.

Giving out free e-hugs for those who could use one.

Best and most common advice i heard during the 2017 run. When your 80x your initial investment, though, it's better to take out more.

Good read

Got my first gold ounce after trading a friend 40 LTC for it in 2017 at around $40 per coin. Still don't regret it.
