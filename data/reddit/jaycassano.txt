Yup, basically. We'll be seeing active crypto traders in Congress very soon. But we won't have a comprehensive list of everyone who owns Bitcoin until next year.

I wrote [the article]( this tweet is based on (and screenshot was taken from). Technically members of Congress only have to disclose their holdings once a year in their annual financial disclosures, which usually come out in the Spring. So we likely won't know everyone who is HODLing until next year. What we will see between now and then are the periodic transaction reports for any members of Congress who make any crypto trades, which they will have to report within 45 days of the transactions, just like buying or selling stocks. My colleagues and I at Sludge will be continuing to keep an eye on those transaction reports (which are often hand-written and a pain to search through) for any significant crypto trades.

Well, I can't speak to the motivations of a particular member of Congress. But you can imagine that if someone were committed to financial transparency they would use the electronic filing system with searchable forms. Here's [a page]( from Goodlatte's disclosure from last year. Good luck trying to make sense of that.
