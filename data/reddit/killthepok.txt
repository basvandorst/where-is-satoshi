You should take the time to do research before investing anymore into Bitcoin.
Private keys are the only way you access your coins. **Not your keys, not your bitcoin**.
This means if you are using Coinbase, those aren't your Bitcoin. Yes they let you transfer it or sell it but if they wanted to they could close shop and you'd be 100% out of coins with no way to get them back. Ever.
A hardware wallet is one of the most secure ways to hold your private keys. It is a small device that plugs into a computer and it generates the keys in a secure chip on the device. This chip is completely removed from the parts that talk to the computer and all transactions are done on the device.
This means that you could use a hardware wallet on a computer that is completely infected with virus or malware.
The software to use hardware wallets are open source and easy to use like most other wallets. 
**An important thing to know about hardware wallets** is there is still a risk. **That risk is you!** The wallet, like all wallets that give you access to the private keys, uses a seed that generates these keys. I see people here everyday say that they type that seed into their computer and save it in a file.
**NEVER DO THIS**. The whole point of the hardware wallet is that the seed is never ever ever online and thus impossible to hack. Write down the seed, keep multiple copies in safe places and never worry about your Bitcoin ever again.
The cons to a hardware wallet is that you have to plug it into something to use. I can't just wip it out and send coins to someone, I'd have to grab a laptop or something. Luckily, the ledger wallets use a chrome extension so you can use it with any computer with ease. 
If you are looking to frequently spend bitcoin then I'd keep an amount you are ok with losing on a mobile wallet where you control the seed. Mobile wallets are probably the best software wallets you can use due to the fact that mobile operating systems are so well made in the security aspect. 
Good luck! I suggest the ledger nano s if you are going to get one. **I sleep so good at night knowing my Bitcoin is safe!**

On the flip side, my father really wanted to get into Bitcoin after I told him I got some. He is now super sad because it has more than doubled when I told him about it and he wasn't able to buy in.

Of course I could be wrong but it's gaining traction, it's resisting attacks, and scaling is being implemented soon. 
Now we just need good education and easy to use tools.

Just making sure, you know it is just like a software wallet in that you can spend coin by plugging it into a computer and scan QR codes etc etc.

What is the draw to eth 
I hope I don’t come across as rude, I’m being honest. 
Some concerns I have are the bugs that lost millions. The fact that one man is basically eth god and can roll back anything he wants making it completely centralized. It lacks the economics of bitcoin. Also it turns out having a computer isn’t as useful as people thought. 
So are their upsides to it?

Every single crypto besides bitcoin doesn’t have to deal with scale. 
Look at the transactions going through. The freeways are empty because no one lives there. 
BCash loves to say how low the fees are. It’s because there are 80 transactions per block. No one is using it.

I totally get it and I want to use it as a currency also. But right now there is no crypto stable enough to be a currency. No business is going to accept a currency that drops 20% value in a day. 
The only viable solution would be if you put in cash and instantly spend it and they are automatically cashing out when you send it to them. This isn’t really using crypto.

It's been 5 hours since your comment but I just got a Ledger Nano S 2 days ago so I'll let you know my first impressions.


That is a good way to think about it. Your private keys, which give you accesses to your bitcoins, are stored on the device. It is secured so that the keys never ever touch a computer, all of the authorization of transactions are done on the Ledger.


Yes, that's what I did.


Yes, it is ready to go when you need it.
The ledger is a nice piece of hardware. It doesn't feel like the sturdiest thing I've bought but it doesn't feel cheap either. The user experience is great and I instantly felt better having my coins on the wallet. Take your time and carefully read the instructions and guides. The most important part of the wallet is the part where they tell you to **write down your 24 words**. This is the seed for your keys, you **need** to write them down and keep them safe. Most importantly **never put them into a computer or take a picture or digitize them in any way**. This is why you have a hardware wallet, to keep the keys offline. If you put them in a notepad or take a picture on your phone then the whole processes is pointless.
There are advanced privacy options I think you should know about. First **If you use a segwit address (you should) then you must update your ledger bitcoin wallet on the device itself**. If you need links I'll give them but basically the segwit wallet by default doesn't let you verify a receiving address which is completely fucking **stupid** but an update fixes that. 
Scramble the pin is a great security feature if you want to use the device in public and don't want people counting your clicks.
Passphrase is a 25th word that makes a second wallet on your device. You can give someone your normal pin and have a few hundred bucks and they will think that's all you have. Then you have a 2nd wallet with a different pin and that has the other bitcoins in it.
All in all it is probably one of the coolest devices I own and I sleep better at night knowing my coins are safer.

It’s not necessary a seed vs private key thing.  But if you are typing in that information on a computer, even if you encrypt it, you are running the risk of it being compromised.

I suggest you don't touch it. You will probably sell at the slightest sign of a dip and lose a lot of money. Understand the technology and why this is a huge disruption in the financial industry. If you don't understand the value of a decentralized, peer to peer, trust-less, value transfer system then there is really nothing left to convince you.

If you are paying $3 in fees you either don't know what you are doing or you are using a wallet that you shouldn't be using.
Right now the mempool is consisting of 5-10 sat/B

It’s simplifying it but essentially it is just as secure but you have the software that lets you easily move it if necessary. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 21:13:38
If you are typing it into a computer it is less secure and defeats the purpose. Safety deposit box is all good though.

They have wallets for a lot of alt-coins. All the ones you listed are supported.
@_date: 2017-12-12 06:49:12
You completely missed the point. 
The library doesn’t need to know where I eat lunch. The bank doesn’t need to know I just came from the park. The grocery store doesn’t need to know which doctor I go to. 
These sites collect information and pass it along to the next. Thy collect your shopping habits and other sites start to advertise like minded products for you. If you click on a link from site A to site B, site B knows where you are coming from. 
I am removing this control over my information as much as i can. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 05:58:36
They are using a wallet that doesn’t let them set their fees. 
Right this second, the mempool is mostly 0-10 sat/B. 
Look for yourself. No explanation needed. This is at max 35c. 
I love uneducated people spending high fees and bitching about it. Stop using software that doesn’t let you set your fees.

People still talk to me like I'm the first one, it's just more common now since everyone is talking about it.
My mom's friend started talking bad about it I guess and didn't want to send her a text because he thought I'd get mad??? 
I told her I wouldn't, I don't really care if people think it's this or that. I believe it is the future of currency and banking. Why would I care that some old dude doesn't get it.
Funny enough, he thinks it's a ponzi scheme even though he himself is part of a MLM pyramid scheme. Huh

Get prepared to have your inbox filled with naysayers who don’t know how to set fees. 
People need to understand that being your own bank is a lot of responsibility. You have to know how to handle taxes, handle fees, handle security. 
Most people suck at all of those things. 
He’ll most people here probably just know the price of bitcoin and that’s it. 
We need better education resources for newcomers. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 17:50:18
That’s a whole other security risk 
@_date: 2017-12-05 18:21:03

That defeats the purpose of the hardware wallet! Even though that’s what the comment op does he shouldn’t do that. 
Make physical backups of your seed 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:16:12
That’s not how this works. Why do you think they give a fuck unless you sell?
Are you seriously telling the government every address and coin you have? 
You don’t have to pay taxes or report anything until you sell. It’s that simple. Doesn’t mean you shouldn’t be taking down every bit of information. 
I have an excel file a mile long with every single transaction, sell and buy price, etc. 
This assists me when I pay taxes. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 17:16:18
The fork means that at one point BCash started creating its own chain. 
It is much more centralized because it’s scaling solution will lead to fewer and fewer nodes and currently the mining is so small that it could be mined from a single entity. Also very vulnerable to a 51% attack if a big mining pool wanted to since the % of hash power is so tiny. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 01:19:26
What the fuck are you even talking about? You pay a % every year even when you don’t sell? LOL
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:40:10

You have convinced yourself that you are somehow making a valid point. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 18:41:39
BCH has empty blocks with ~100 transactions per block. If BTC has that many transactions there would be no fees as well. 
Bigger blocks haven’t even been proven to work at scale. Not saying they won’t but as I said before, BCH is not anywhere near the scale of BTC.
Also, the price of the BTC you are moving has nothing to do with fee. It’s about the inputs and outputs. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 07:58:25

I like seeing these videos, they help me prepare for the questions the uniformed have.
Today I talked to my girlfriends dad. He said bitcoin is a scam, you can just make more of it in a second and it isn't backed by anything. Also, whoever this Satoshi guy is is just going to take all our bitcoins some day, what a ponzi scheme.
I would never have been prepared for a conversation like this if I just heard from you guys. We all get Bitcoin, my girlfriends dad does not. He listens to the "experts" and we have to too so that we can understand where the uninformed are coming from.

What do you expect in a discussion thread like this. 
People who have no understand of bitcoin, no understand of why it was made, no understanding of the technology behind it, no understanding of the economics are mindlessly spewing negativity reading off scripts. 
They will talk shit and they will get left behind.

I just got back from a Christmas party where everyone was shitting on bitcoin. 
Pretty much: 
“It’s way too late now to get in, you’ll never make money”
“It’s not real”
“It just tanked it’ll probably go to 0”
“Only an idiot would buy now”. 
It was so funny to hear because most of these people said the same thing when it was at $5k in October.. it has tripled in price since then. If I didn’t buy when they said it was “too late” I would have been pissed today. 
Just ignore the uninformed. They are just spewing ignorance about things they don’t understand. 
@_date: 2017-12-03 01:33:34

That it’s a scam. I shouldn’t be getting into it. That i don’t know what I’m doing. One guy saying that he is holding back because he doesn’t want to hurt my feelings. 
Like i give a fuck what some out of touch 50 year old thinks about Bitcoin. 
Every single one of her friends works in a “be your own boss” pyramid scheme so their claims are rich. Also a couple of her friends think it’s an actual coin. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 21:29:17
I just got into bitcoin and the first thing I started doing was mining with nice hash. It took over a month and a half to get to the .01 payout and was supposed to get paid on Friday. 
I am extremely sad that the payout wasn’t met... I know my hash rate was super low but I just thought mining was so cool so I decided it was worth it for me. 
Now it’s all gone. 
To those of you saying you shouldn’t keep it in an online wallet, I didn’t. They only pay out at .01 to an external wallet. So I had my mining pointed to my external wallet and just hit the mark last Saturday..  
@_date: 2017-12-28 22:15:49

Not saying that this is a proof that bitcoin will succeed. 
Wow it is amazing to look back and see the same type of negativity and naysayers that talked shit about amazon. People that have no clue what a gigabyte is suggesting it is silly that amazon is overthrowing sears. 
It totally reminds me of people who have no understanding of Crypto currencies saying its a bubble and will be $0 soon.

Her mom just looked at me and said "Yeah, too bad it's not real" and walks out of the room. She thinks it's just monopoly money haha. Oh well.
It also makes me think her and my girlfriend were talking about it when I'm not around but who knows.

I’m going to give my dad .005. This is a big chunk of mine but I know how much he is interested in it and he is super bummed he is not at a place where he can just drop money into bitcoin. 
He is behind on work and doing the smart thing. All while talking about with me and doing research. 
I’m only worried that he is going to lose it or eventually just forget about it. He isn’t good with tech and I’ve been teaching him about bitcoin but it’s a little out there for him. 
He has forgotten his bread wallet pin 3 times now. 
Still he does a lot so .005 is nothing. I just hope it makes him feel better about it. I could tell he got sad when I said it hit $9000.

How to you work that out in your taxes? 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:12:45
Why is this a problem? Cost? Mining one coin would cover a household electricity bill 10x over. 
Waste? It is securing the network with billions of dollars going over it and invested in it. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 17:02:11
Well a few this. I simply bring up some people don’t believe it and I get downvotes like I don’t believe it. 
I am all for stopping climate change bruh
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:38:13
Built on the same network and ideas. So proof of work? Then if they don’t have the hash rate bitcoin has it is less secure. 
IOTA is interesting, I’m open to new ideas. Nothing has been tested to the scale of bitcoin though so it is hard to say these new concepts are secure. We can only really compare proof of work right now and the only way to be as secure as bitcoin is to have the same amount of hashing power. 
Also i really don’t trust a coin where the website runs like dogshit on any browser.
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:50:13
Never make a digital backup of your hardware wallet. That defeats the purpose. 
It is 100% recommended to make a physical backup though. Multiple in fact. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:18:27
Not saying I don’t but not everyone has the same views on global warming as you. 
Also again it is extremely important work and is the reason why bitcoin is the most secure network. 
If anything there should be research on solar or making more efficient hardware or redirecting heat into energy. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:41:26
It’s securing the network and their reward is the coins... nice try though 
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:46:11
What I am saying is it is not important for things to be green to some people. So something using a fuck ton of energy isn’t a problem to them. 
Also this is assuming that man made climate change is a thing. Another debated topic. 
@_date: 2017-11-27 07:43:41
If you have cash then nothing can stop you from using a BTC atm. 
You will have to show records for taxes on how you got the BTC, the rate at which you bought it and how much you bought if you sell it for fiat though. 
@_date: 2017-11-26 19:48:59
Very true. But bitcoin isn’t a company. It’s a protocol. Protocols get updated and changed. Nothing stops bitcoin from doing the same.

None with the reputation of Bitcoin.
None with the amount of infrastructure of Bitcoin.
None with the accumulated Proof of Work of Bitcoin.
None with the community and advice of Bitcoin.
None with the adoption of Bitcoin.
The great thing about software is that you can update it. Other coins may have better tech but that doesn't mean Bitcoin can't upgrade to compete. The things I listed are very valuable.

If you read me comments in this chain of comments I even state that I’m not saying these are my views. This whole thing was under that premise. 
I’m all for finding a better solution. But it is depending on the majority of the community to fix this issue. The 10k people on reddit who hold green views are nothing compared to the millions of Chinese who don’t.
