Sometimes it has to do with your video card. Hitting esc at grub and adding nomodprobe to the boot command line worked for me.

Wouldn't it be more valuable to just hold on to the currency units, rather than get back fewer of them at the end of a loan?
Or are we assuming that the nominal interest rate will still be positive?

Write your asterisks (\*) with a backslash (\\) in front of them to avoid treating them like special characters. Also I've never heard of "splats" before today.
\\* =&gt; \*
If you surround some text with an asterisk on each side, the text will display in *italics*. If you put two asterisks on either side, the text will display in **bold**. Three asterisks will make the text both ***bold and italic***.
Underscores (_) do the exact same thing as asterisks.

Google Authenticator is not vulnerable. The data is on your phone's drive only. If you put your sim in a new phone, you don't get access to your Google Authenticator data in the new phone. It stays on the old one. This makes it a pain when you change phones, but it's important for security.
Authy, on the other hand, is tied to your phone number, so I think it could be vulnerable.

Do people in India actually call a cold wallet a "chilly wallet"?
@_date: 2012-08-15 16:20:40
Yeah. That's crazy.
At 3% per week, you're paying 365% interest per year.
1% per week is 68% per year.
You'd be much better off borrowing USD at 3 or 4% per year and just buying and holding BTC directly. The USD you'd owe would become worth less with respect to bitcoins over time too. (Or at least you'd assume so if you're entering into a long position.)

Couldn't you sign a message with your private key to prove you "own" that account? Then check the blockchain to show that there was a transfer from your account to the account of the accused?

...And it's gone.
The price jumped up pretty quickly too.
@_date: 2012-12-06 18:42:53
I guess it's is that day traders want to be able to trade instantly. If the transaction has to wait for the participants to send bitcoins and then wait for confirmations, day trading would be near impossible.
I think what happens now is that everyone's coins are held in the exchange's own account. When people trade, no coins actually move in the blockchain; only numbers in an internal database change. When you want to cash out, then coins are transferred out of the exchange's account into an account of your choosing.
Because of this, you don't know if the exchange even has all the bitcoins on hand. In fact, they probably do not. If they're smart, they'll move most of the coins into an offline wallet for safekeeping. But for all we know they've sold the coins. That's one reason why we need audits of sites like Mt. Gox.

You should have your paper wallets split with an m-of-n system. There should be n keys, where m of which are required to get access to the wallet. You can split them into saftey deposit boxes, safes, stored with family members that you can trust enough, etc.

And that's why the trustee sold slowly over several months.
@_date: 2018-03-09 12:47:13
How do you figure? Perhaps he used an optimal strategy and, despite the effects on the market price, any other actions he might have taken would have resulted in even less money for the creditors. You can't just say "the price went down over the months he sold therefore he did a bad job."

If miners start shutting off their rigs, the network hash rate will drop. This will cause the difficulty to drop at the next readjustment. With a lower difficulty, it will take less electricity to solve for blocks and the remaining miners will be more profitable. The protocol was designed to handle both increases and decreases in price.
@_date: 2018-02-07 15:09:59
Sure. And you don't have any information available, only your guesses. You can't compare this to a situation where you have preset odds of wining with a specified payout.
@_date: 2018-02-07 13:42:06
Fine. I agree with that. But that only works when you know both the odds and the payout ahead of time--and, like ifixthecable mentioned, you can afford the loss when it doesn't pan out.
But you don't have a crystal ball to tell you the odds of Bitcoin moving up or to what level. You're just guessing like the rest of the market is.

Not only that, but the correction isn't over yet. It's premature for the OP to be referring to it as a past event. The correction is *at least* 62% as of today.
Also, it's worth knowing that an ~~82%~~ 84.8% correction is equivalent to a 556% increase.

And they'd be telling everyone to "HODL" while they desperately unload their coins
@_date: 2018-02-07 14:42:27
I don't say it's 50/50. I'm saying nobody *knows*. That's why you can't compare it to a game of chance with pre-set odds and a pre-set payout.
When taking a risk with unknown odds and an unknown payout, you don't get to say you made a "good decision" just because you *believe* the odds x payout &gt; 1. In this type of situation, If you lost money then it was a bad decision. If you made money it was a good decision.
@_date: 2018-02-05 13:50:31


Lol, wut? A downward 20 percentage point discrepancy is huge!
If you think it doesn't make a difference between saying it's a 42% correction an a 62% correction, then you should have no problem calling it an 82% correction. (It's only a measly 20 percentage points after all!) But an 82% correction is almost the same as a 556% increase. An 84.76% decrease would completely erase a 556% increase.
    (1 + 5.56) x (1 - 0.8476) =~ 1
Decreases in percentage points are "worth more" than increases. You could get a 2,394,587% increase but a 100% drop will wipe out everything. That's why a 62% drop is nothing to sneeze at.
@_date: 2018-02-07 12:52:38


That's not how you determine if it was a good decision or not. It wasn't a good idea of you were wrong.
I might *think* the moon is made of green cheese and that a lunar mission to retrieve said cheese will make me rich. That doesn't mean that investing in such a mission is a good decision.
Belief in a particular price movement doesn't make poor investment decisions into good ones.

This is correct. We're talking about ECB deposit rate here. It has an influence on the rate a retail customer will get at the bank, but the two rates are not the same thing.

There's a 200 CAD spread on the CAD/BTC market on Kraken. It looks like someone put in a market sell order for ~300k CAD worth of coins and ate up all the bids down to 525 CAD (the previous bids were around 700 CAD)

First of all, I'm not sure that Stephen Jen "reckoning" that something will happen is proof, nor the consensus from a poll. Both are conjecture. No matter how educated the guesses are, they are still guesses.
Also what your linked article is talking about is the ECB deposit rate. That is the rate the ECB pays to big banks when they keep their money in the ECB overnight. It influences--but is not the same thing as--"rate applied to retail banking", as the OP mentions.
Maybe there is some other article that explains what the OP is talking about?

HTML doesn't show double spaces though unless you put some extra work in.
