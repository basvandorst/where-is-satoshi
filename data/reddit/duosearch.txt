Moderators don't have to be anonymous. They can also be a registered company with resources, insurance, and IRL offices. The OpenBazaar protocol is agnostic.

The moderators are not chosen at random. There is a market of moderators, and the buyer and seller agree on one before the transaction (based on moderator reputation, fees, speed, language, etc.)

The OpenBazaar equivalent is a local moderator who resolves disputes. That's a core part of OpenBazaar.

OpenBazaar offers a market of moderators. It's a different modal. This means more choice, competition and freedom.
Airbnb is subject to censorship from regulators in certain cities (e.g. Paris, Berlin, San Francisco, Barcelona). Such a central point of failure doesn't exist with OpenBazaar.
Also, Airbnb commands fees of 6-12% (guest) + 3% (host) = 9-15%. OpenBazaar moderator fees tend to be a order of magnitude smaller.

Which server is that?

Here's an example from 3 days ago:




Ordering the removal of listings is an example of censorship.

Airbnb is a moderator between hosts and guests.
Obnb also moderates between hosts and guests (using a market of moderators and 2-of-3 multisig).

Yes, Barcelona's town hall ordering the removal of 256 OpenBazaar listings would be futile.

Duo Search ( is aiming to get OpenBazaar to the browser (i.e. for all OS) for OB2.0
@_date: 2016-04-20 23:16:33
Not yet, coming soon. Sorry, it's quite basic, we should have it already :)

Airbnb started out in 2007 without insurance, which only came in 2011.
@_date: 2016-04-20 14:54:44
Thanks for the feedback. We are planning on adding urls just like you suggest.
@_date: 2016-04-22 18:48:10
Thanks a lot for the ideas! We have a lot of basic stuff to get right still, but I've noted this (showing offline listings) done so that we can speak about it later.
@_date: 2016-04-22 09:30:06


That's a reasonably apt analogy. I personally do this almost never though.
I think what we'll do is list online stores only for now. Wait a bit to see how many vendors try and operate by running their store only when they are online, and if the proportion is high enough compared to those who run their store 24/7, then think about how to include offline listings as you suggest above. Does that sound reasonable?
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:10:17
We didn't think this use case was important. We've seen some complaints from people who click on links shown by bazaarbay only to find themselves staring at rotating arrows and find the page doesn't load after a while in the OB client. How do you buy things through the OB client from offline vendors? If you can explain the importance of the use case we may reconsider.
@_date: 2016-04-20 19:06:19
Yup, we do :)
@_date: 2016-04-20 22:32:30
Thanks for the suggestions. We know there is still a lot to do but thought it useful anyhow to make it public. Infinity scroll as suggests may be what we go with (no promises).
@_date: 2016-04-21 20:27:50
Thanks for the feedback. We'll be including an uptime metric or two shortly. We also think it's very important.
We do try to take listings down when vendors go offline and are working to make the time they are listed while offline as short as possible.
Do you think caching listings is important? Is there a strong use case for wanting to buy stuff where the vendor is currently offline? We feel that vendors should always be online to be selling things and that those who are not are simply too unreliable to get listed. What do you think? Reasonable or not?

Thank you!

If you intend to build on OpenBazaar 2.0, please DM. :)

Sounds cool! Is it documented somewhere?

Misleading title. Brian is CEO of OB1.

OpenBazaar is not a company.

What is this other way?

Still working on this ;) The Duo team once tried these Croatian waffles:  Pretty good!

I like this idea I think some other p2p trading systems implement something like this already (I forget names). Basically you are suggesting that a small barrier to using OpenBazaar is placed on new users so that the whole place is less of a scam haven. Why do your collaterals need to be so high though. If the buyer is buying something for 0.1 btc, would it not be sufficient for him to add 0.2 btc to the 2 of 2 multisig, while the seller adds 0.1 btc?
In a similar way to how the seller adds moderators to each listing, he could also optionally add an option for the buyer to choose to use this collateralised method of buying.
One question though. Who adds to the 2 of 2 first? Some first time scam sellers may just be in it for the kicks and want to see hapless buyers essentially burn their coins.

It looks like that's processed now on onename so it should appear on your store in the client under your store name.
A few others are having this issue that if they switch handle, it doesn't update. Did you switch to this handle?
If so, you may want to contribute your case to  so that they are moved to fix this issue.
Once it works in OpenBazaar you will be able to use a URL like this on duosear.ch:

Search is very limited in the OB client currently because nodes see only a small part of the network. Also, it's limited to tags only at the moment.
