This is about transparency.  And is a very realistic plan: betwen 13000€ and 25000€ to finish darkwallet
 Why when people talk about millions to found a project don't sound like a fraud?

The project will be very fruitfull. We are making the wallet that we want to have and to manage all needed for autonomy. We'll to have our colection of keys, our trusted chains, identity, chat, blockchain browser, sthealt address, mixing, multisign  and this is the begging :) Test the app and you'll see all these features. But to really finish this wee need more time. The wallet need more dedication. And we'll give this.
And thanks to comment. Food is cheap in Spain.

Hello community
Darkwallet Sysop here
We had some problems with the DNS blocked at some ISP`s. We are
migrating the domain to another server but something fails at the
payment moment. Our invoice are pending because they declined our
payment, but they take the money from our account. We are waiting for
answer of the suport of eurodns.
Sorry  for the downtime. All other services are online.
Some question, look for at  irc.freenode.net
ps: I'm trying to put this message signed buts this editor is crazy.
UPDATE: the webpage are online again. 
I've tunned the settings for the SSL cert and some people report some misfunction. Maybe you'll need to upgrade your web-browser. After the upgrade all works properly.
Thanks ppl

About the Obelisk, don't expect a stable service for now. The libbitcoin team are working on this to a stable release soon.
