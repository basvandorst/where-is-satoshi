Well, yeah, that works too, what I meant by independently funded was things like that. Independently as in not owned by a single company.


Ok so asking something is part of the free market.


Except when it's not, apparently. Wow. Such Logic.
PS: even in a Free Market (tm) this is hardly done.


If Mark is cleared of wrongdoing, then he is cleared of wrongdoing. That's what justice is about. There's absolutely nothing wrong with this.
Also, what. How is relying on authorities mean companies can doing what they want?

@_date: 2014-08-25 07:26:02
You're delusional at best if you think people will bother with "self executing contracts, multi-sig escrows" etc if bitcoin ever becomes relevant enough to replace the dollar. What is going to happen is that merchants are going to take Visa/Paypal/etc, replace it with the bitcoin equivalent, and nothing will change. 
PS: the bitcoin equivalent of Visa/Paypal/etc will, indeed, take processing fees, because it actually costs money to process everything smoothly.
Bitcoin is not fundamentally different than fiat money (when it comes to trading things for currency), except bitcoin is significantly more tedious when it comes to small currency exchanges (like buying a loaf of bread from the bakery, or giving your nephew some pocket money after he mowed your lawn, etc.), and significantly less tedious for long distance money transfers between non-business parties.

Great. Everyone should do that.


What. What does this have anyhing to do with the Free Market(tm)? In a regulated market you can't ask about your exchange's processes?


Yes, understanding how things work is great and information should be free. But this still has nothing to do with the Free Market(tm)


Yeah, no. You need authorities to punish offenders. Because no customer will be able to go after Gox if they run away with the money. I don't even know why I need to type this out.


Sure, but ultimately their words means jack shit. Without proper audits, it's impossible to do anything but blindly accept their press releases. I mean weeks ago MtGox was all like "doods it's just temporary don't panic"

I can totally see the average bitcoin user not foaming at the mouth at the idea that you'll be able to track their transactions (something that will be required if you want any kind of buyer protection) and that they'll have to pay taxes to fund all this infrastructure.

It's like solving a problem absolutely nobody has by creating a more complex problem.
Yes, we had private bank notes in the past. It was a system that slowly grew incompatible with the realities of the modern world.

It's funny you should mention that because there was some dude who set out on living with nothing but french-made products in Paris. And not french assembled, french-made, out of a 1600€ monthly paycheck.  
This also included culture.
And the only thing he was missing was a car, because most of the parts are manufactured in eastern europe. He had a smartphone, a tablet, a TV, a washing machine, etc etc etc.
It turns out that the western world is perfectly able to manufacture their own things, and that you can live off locally made stuff on a slightly above average paycheck. It's not like we don't have chip fabs etc.
So, yeah, you're full of shit. Making it impratical for multinational to import cheaply made products from 3rd world shitholes wouldn't drastically reduce our living standards. If anything, it'd start to look more interesting to set up manufactures over here again, which will provide jobs and raise it. 
So again, fuck huge corps who manufacture their shit in China because they can happily trample on basic workers rights all day everyday. Fuck them hard.

Yeah right, we'll talk about this when you'll lose your job to some Chinese dude who's getting told that he has to work 18 hours a day for peanuts and if he's not happy he can always go back to his rice fields or whatever.
The global economy is a one way street. Multinational groups get all the benefits (cheap workforce and lax regulations) and simple workers like me get left behind with all the problems (high unemployment).
I'm in direct competition with east Asian workers on completely unfair grounds, so as far as I am concerned they can go fuck themselves. 
I'll vote for the first politician with the balls to heavily tax import from countries were basic worker rights are being trampled and fuck the EU.

Just go a head and marry Newegg or something.
Situation A: 
"Here is a product I sell", says the scammer, "it is very interesting and you can pay with bitcoin!"
"I'll take three dozens", said the enthusiastic user, "They will look good next to my collection of bitcoin paraphernalia!"
"Lol, sucker, I now have your money and you don't have anything. This is the best currency ever", thought the scammer! 
Situation B:
"Here is a product I sell", says Newegg, "it is very interesting and you can pay with bitcoin!"
"I'll take three dozens", said the enthusiastic user, "They will look good next to my collection of bitcoin paraphernalia!"
A couple days later, the products turn out defective and/or not actually what was bought. "No refunds, see it's written right there in the fine prints. So long, sucker.", said NewEgg, laughing all the way to the  bank with your money. 
You would make a chargeback but since this is bitcoin, the most safe and secure currency ever, where nobody can steal your coins, you decide that this is actually good for bitcoin and make a reddit post about how it's different because in the end you are screwed out of your hard earned bitcoins just the same.
Meanwhile, the next guy who used fiat, just threatens a chargeback and gets Newegg to act reasonably. Also, apparently, someone stole all the CC numbers at Newegg but he doesn't give a shit because any half decent bank provides one-time use CCs for internet purchases.

Madoff was a scam that had nothing to do with regulations, the simple fact that you're using him as an excuse to not have any kind of regulation is like saying "look, the police couldn't stop that murder therefore we shouldn't have any police at all"
The other two happened because of lax regulations after a period of relative economic stability. And all of thoses were fixed by regulating the economy tighter than a frightened virgin about to lose it to John Holmes.
Please entertain me about how no regulation wouldn't have made shit way, way worse.
And no, "The Free Market (tm) would have magically fixed itself" is absolutely not a valid answer.

Well, first you're comparing a fledging (and i'm being generous here) currency to a worldwide banking system. It's like comparing apples to apple pies.
Your delusions lie in the fact that you believes that whenever (if it ever) bitcoin becomes relevant enough for mass adoptions, you won't need banks, payment processors, etc. (hint: these things appeared out of necessity, because we need them, bitcoin won't change that)
