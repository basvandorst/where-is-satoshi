Plus, I have a feeling most of the money that isn't based on gambling will be generated from technologies that operate on a higher layer than the currency itself.

Literally gambling in the casino. Either lose it all or win big to then lose it all.

In fact, if you harden that paste with some heat, you get a brand.

The idea of calling someone stupid when you work at the same place is just childish and probably why such a person would lose money in the first place.

Then why the hell would you want to use the current "expert" opinion when it might have no bearing on how the economic landscape is going to be in another 50 years?

People don't seem to get it. You have these people sharing the headline who then comment "lol fake news" and then wonder what's going on. Dude, you're sharing the story and they still never said anything wrong outside of a headline. If you think it's fake news, don't share it.

If it only takes a headline mistake to catalyze the "majority" then their opinion becomes irrelevant. They are slaves to their actions prescribed by these orgs. Like I said, have whatever opinion you want on whether this is fake news, but any outcry against it simply makes that person look impetuous and sharing it is even more egregious for containing fake news.

This is just some arbitrary crap to rationalize your biases.
