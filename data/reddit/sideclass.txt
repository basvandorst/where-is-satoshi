I don't follow that argument.
The utility of bitcoin as a store of value or medium of exchage does not decrease as it price increases. Only its utilility as a speculative investment decreases.

Gold isn't an investment. The point of buying gold isn't to make a profit. 
The point is to own an asset whose future worth and liquidity is uncorrelated with your other assets.
The point is to hedge against crises where you might suddently lose access to all non-physical assets at the same time.

People who have been around since 2010 will remember that the were like a dozen other exchanges apart from mtgox. They all failed, but they failed for the wrong reasons - they were overwhelmed by red tape and massive regulatory costs of running an exchange. This selected "winners" run by cowboys and crooks who simply did't bother to comply with regulations.
By 2012 mtgox almost had a monopoly, but they did't get there by offering the best product at the lowest price. In fact, their service was almost comically bad yet people continued to use them. Their monopoly allowed their incompetence to continue to fester until 2014.
Only after mtgox crashed, and well funded exchanges backed by venture capitalists apperead, did the healthy competition begin.
The early days of bitcoin exchanges are a clear example of market failure to me, a market failure that was ironically exacerbated by excessive government regulation.

Gold is crisis money. It will still work if the internet is down. That's why it's a good idea to own a handful of gold coins. That's also why gold is still popular in more financially cautious cultures like Germany, and will continue to be popular for a long time.
I do think that gold might one day lose its status as a store-of-value in favor of a cryptocurrency that also works offline, but I think it will take generations.

There are some purists in the Ethereum community who continue using ETH while totally ignoring the existence of ETC (and vice versa).
The question is, who gets the ETC they are ignoring? Well , if they just continue spending their ETH without bothering to implement a splitting contract, any recipient will be able to claim both ETC and ETH.
Similar thing could happen with the bitcoin ETF. As soon as anybody claims their ETF balance for real coins, they would get 2 coins, even if the ETF managers choose to ignore the 2nd coin.

We as a community are giving far too much power to the miners. We have forgotten that miners really only have one job - to protect users against double spending. 
It is not their job to govern. Who cares if 5%, 50%, or even 80% of miners are not on board with Segwit? Ignore them. Double spending protection would still be more than sufficient even at the fraction of the current hashrate. It is a public good that is being overproduced at the moment thanks to the arbitrary and rather large coinbase.

That's an illusion. You don't benefit from inflation as debtor because banks simply add the expected inflation to their interest rates. That's why in Switzerland (which has a weakly deflationary currency) you can get mortgages for under 2% and in Brazil (which has a strongly inflationary currency) you pay 20% for a mortgage. 
The only time you benefit is when inflation turns out to be higher than forecast by the bank. But it can also swing the other way.

It really depends on your utility curve. 
You see, I have a weird "double hump" utility curve.
I'm not a materialistic person and I am perfectly happy to live frugally for the rest of my life.  
So it really doesn't make much of a difference to me whether my net worth is $200k or $400k. I'm not gonna spend that money anyhow. But if my net worth is suddenly $2-5 Million it means I can quit my job and only work on projects I enjoy. 
Therefore I don't consider it crazy to have 50% of my assets, or $200k, in bitcoin. If I lose it, so what? My life will continue the same as before. But if bitcoin goes up 10-fold in the next 5 years, which I think is at least 30% likely, I'll be able to retire early.

In a libertarian world it would be even worse though. You wouldn't be able to simply hop on plane without the explicit permission of the land owner of your destination airport. Or simply get in a car and drive without the explicit permission of the road owner. If you don't own any land yourself, or fail to reach agreements with other land owners, you would be permanently trespassing.
The concept of moving about freely as a *right*, at least within the national borders, is a concept that didn't exist before nation states. In medieval times movement was a lot more restricted. Many people weren't even able to leave their *city*, so I think nation states are a big improvement even if they are not perfect.

Yep. Miners have too much power right now. That power needs to be rebalanced toward the entire community. We are now learning that Satoshi's protocol is too simplistic. It needs to be fine tuned further. Ideally, miners should only have the power to secure the chain, to enforce the existing protocol rules. They should not have the power to modify the protocol to their liking. Only stakeholders should have that power.

If that is true, that is even more of a reason to limit the decision-making power of hashrate.


And why should contractors be given a seat at the table?  That would be like the Fed inviting the company that makes paper for banknotes to the table where monetary policy is decided.


That's how it should work. Miners are specialists who have a specific task and one task only. Their job is to secure the network against double spending. Period. If they don't like that, they are free to stop mining. They produce a commodity and are easy to replace.

I have a friend who is about 50, fairly conservative, not tech savvy, and works for Big Finance. 3 years ago when I told him about bitcoin he laughed about it. Now he wants to invest a fraction of his pension fund (about $10k) in bitcoin and other cryptos, and is asking me for technical advice!
According to him, many of his colleagues at work are considering investing too, but most are still intimidated because bitcoin is "too technical" for them.

Holding crypto at coinbase defies the point of using crypto.
You may as well just hold fiat at a bank. In fact, you are better off holding fiat at a bank because a bank is far safer than coinbase.
Using a hardware wallet is not THAT hard, even if you are "bad will computers". Practice with a small amount of bitcoins first to gain confidence.

"Fake volume" is not accurate because the bids are real. "Cheap volume" would be a better term.
Think of friction as an analogy. A car has a tiny amount of frinction at low speed, but as it travels faster the friction/drag adds up and it will soon hit a top speed.
A spacecraft on the other hand travels in a zero friction environment and it can be accelerated to enormous speeds even with a small amount of power.
The gist is that trading volume or "speed" is highly sensitive to "friction" or transaction costs. Even a tiny transaction cost of a few per mill has a huge impact on volume compared to zero transaction cost.

It doesns't matter that everyone has channels to centralized banking authorities if that is what they prefer.
What matters is that nobody is forced to use those centralized banking authorities, and the option to switch to another one of millions of "banking authorities" at a low cost exists.
That alone will keep those "banking authorities" in check.
It's a bit like Bitstamp vs. Localbitcoins vs. Bitsquare. Bitstamp has much higher volume than the latter because of convenience and network effects. However Bitstamp does not have the power to arbitrarily increase trading fees
Or a bit like gmail vs running your own email server. Gmail knows that if it pulls off some shit like censoring emails people will simply leave and switch to a slighlty more inconvenient alternative. Which is why it does't even bother.

Storing data on the blockchain itself is very expensive, because blockchains are highly redundant, and were designed to sacrifice efficiency for security.
However, blockchains can be used to *manage* decentralized data storage. The data itself is stored off-chain, the blockchain is only used to keep track who owns what data, to incentivize data availability, and so on.

The problem is that almost all traditional payment methods are reversible to some extent and bitcoin is irreversible. The two don't play well together.
The problem will be solved by making bitcoin more reversible at the consumer level. Eg. When you buy bitcoin, it will be initially held in a multisig escrow account. That account is blocked for all purchases unless the merchant is whitelisted by the escrow agent. After a certain period (6 months for credit card purchases because that's how long they can be reversed), the bitcoins can be moved to a normal address that the user has full control over.

Bitcoin is not necessarily a gamble. It depends on how you use it. Adding a small percentage of bitcoin to your portfolio and balancing it with more conservative assets actually improves your financial safety because:
* bitcoin is negatively correlated to most traditional assets
* it provides a degree of protection against black swan risks such as another Cyprus-style banking crisis.
Outright banning the mention of bitcoin is a childish policy.
@_date: 2017-06-01 09:47:30
There are no "low-risk" options for Bitcoin. 
If Bitcoin doesn't innovate then it will be overtaken, and eventually replaced, by another coin who does. SegWit has other benefits apart from capacity.
Considering that SegWit has gone through 2 years of testing and has successfully gone live on Litecoin, I would say that the risk of implementing SegWit is smaller than the risk of doing nothing.

You could say that about any new technology or startup. "Show me a startup that makes money in the first 2 years". By that that logic, all startups are shit and not worth inventing in.

I've been following bitcoin for 5 years now and I can't remember a time when things weren't SHERIOUSH.
