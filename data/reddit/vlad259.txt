I feel sure the initial transaction must have a sequence number below MAX_INT-1 before it can be replaced by another tx. Therefore they are detectable right from the start.

But now it's **more reckless** which is an issue for a lot of people. Still, if you can always save them and retransmit them yourself, I guess that brings them back to 'just as risky as before, but no more risky'.

For RBF transactions yes. For other transactions no.

Yes. But my point was that a merchant can choose to flag an RBF 0-conf transaction as risky/more risky.
However, thinking about this, the issue isn't to do with RBF at all, is it? Because the mem pool pruning is the thing that will change merchants' views on 0-conf transactions.

I agree, detect them and treat them as more risky. Personally we'll have a risk limit - call it 1 BTC - and when we go over that in 0-conf RBF txes we won't accept any more until some confirm and lower our current risk.
With regard to the mem pool pruning I reckon we'll save these RBF txes to our db so we can replay them into the network if we really have to later. I'm not expecting a lot of issues with that.
I want to accept 0-conf txes but we won't ship or refund until they are confirmed, RBF or not. Seems sensible to me but I would love to hear any criticism.

But as a merchant you can still decide to not accept any transactions flagged with RBF.
