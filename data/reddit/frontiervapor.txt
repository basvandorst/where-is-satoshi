Haha, yea, we're taking the Doge for a walk! A lot can be said about Doge, both positive and negative, but the community is a lot of fun and I'm proud to be working with them!

I know it doesn't mean much of anything coming from me, but hopefully time will prove that we are completely legit. I don't want to do anything to jeopardize the trust of this community, or any other community with which I work.
We're a very new and very small upstart, so there aren't more than a couple of handfuls of people out there who have dealt with us at this point. I hope y'all give us the chance to prove ourselves!

I hope you do! If not from me then try them from someone else! I firmly believe that eCigarettes are one of the best methods to get off of combustible cigarettes, and even nicotine altogether if that's what you're after. The potential for harm reduction is amazing, and is what inspired me to open FrontierVapor!

We ship from eastern Illinois, so our packages tend to get everywhere within a couple of days. We strive to get all packages out the door within 24 hours, but ask for up to 48 hours due to the nature of our business model and the postal service's off day. We prefer to sell fresh made-to-order eLiquid rather than something that has been sitting on a shelf.

As mentioned, we happily accept Bitcoin at [FrontierVapor.com]( We don't have the largest selection of hardware in the world (yet), but what we offer is authentic, and of the highest quality. 
We don't have the Elego Twist or Smok brand VV battery, but we do offer an Innokin iTaste VV v3 starter kit, which is variable voltage, has an LCD readout, and even has an ohm-meter built in for testing your atomizer's resistance. 
Honestly, SunVapers.com probably has what you're looking for where batteries are concerned!
Our juice prices, however, are among the lowest you'll find, and you can get 10% off your purchase with coupon code **reddit** (enter it into the shopping cart before you check-out)! We'd love to have the opportunity to impress you, should you ever need some custom made juice!

Quite strange! I did just receive an order through Bitpay moments before you posted this, so it did go through, but that is unusual behavior. I will look into this issue! Thanks for letting me know!
Edit: This is all sorted out. The redirect URL didn't like guest checkout, but it's all fixed up now.

Thank you so much for the kind words! I really hope you like those flavors!
Oddly, it costs .45 cents less to ship the package in that big flat rate envelope than if I'd just shipped it in the padded bubble mailer itself. Oh USPS... you so crazy!
@_date: 2014-03-02 23:31:27
Thank you so much, we look forward to the opportunity to serve you!
We love to work with our customers to perfect their e-Liquid, so if you need anything special or have any questions please feel free to contact me on here, drop me an email through the site, or make special requests in the comments section of your order!
And don't forget that discount code!

I'll tell you, that First Class mail is faster USPS likes to admit! I'm a big fan... inexpensive and fast!
I hope you like your e-Liquid! If you have any comments or criticisms I'd love to hear them. The only way I can improve my mixing-skills is by listening to criticism!
Thank you very much for giving us a try!

Although we don't have that as a pre-configured flavor, we'd be more than happy to work with you to create something that comes close.
Since flavor is so subjective we'd need to hear your input on what sorts of notes and undertones you'd like. I'd suggest starting, perhaps, with a Salty Caramel flavoring and then adding just a hint of Sweet Pineapple and Bitter-Wizard. That would probably be a good starting point. Let me know what you're after and we'll do our best to work with you!

Hey, just wanted to write back and let you know that we've implemented international shipping! We offer USPS First Class (cheaper) and Priority Mail International (faster). 
Coupon code **reddit** is still good for 10% off everything, and starting this week we'll also be giving 5% of every order to the american cancer society to help fund lung cancer research!
Sorry to bother you!

It was not as difficult as I'd feared it would be. Bitpay made it quite simple to integrate their checkout framework into my site. I can and will update on how well things are going. So far we've received 4 orders in BTC since I posted this announcement, hence the slight delay in my responses here. You folks put me to work mixing up orders right away!
I haven't handled a return in BTC yet, so I can't provide a good answer to that last question. I do know that Bitpay does have a provision to handle returns, though.
Thanks for the great questions!

Thank you so much for shopping with us!
I'm sorry about the confusion with our cart system. Annoyingly, our system doesn't allow you to enter coupon codes during checkout, but rather requires that you enter them in on the Shopping Cart page before you go to the checkout page.
If you'd be so kind as to PM me your wallet address I'll happily issue a 10% refund!

Thank you! Though we are a small up-start we strive to keep our prices as competitive as possible with the big guys!
Unfortunately we do not carry any atomizers or cartomizers that are directly compatible with the Vapor Titan. I beleive the Vapor Titan battery uses what is called "808D" threading. The devices we carry are made to work with 510/eGo threaded batteries.
I have a leftover box or two of empty 510 threaded non-tank-style cartomizers in my stock room that I would be willing to sell you at cost, but we'd have to special order an adapter (Probably ~$6) that would allow you to use your Vapor Titan with the 510 threading. 
We also stock a [DCT Cartomizer]( which uses an inner carto surrounded by a tank. They are my favorite frustration-free tank system, though I could understand not wanting to go through another tank experiment, and as I said, it would still require an adapter for your battery.
If you're interested in an adapter, or those empty cartos, drop us an email through the contact form on our site, or a PM on here. I'm always happy to help with any questions you might have, and we'd do our best to get you set up with high-quality equipment and liquid at a competitive price. We'd love the chance to earn your business!

So far bitpay has been fairly hassle-free. The tax side of things is handled for us by our cart software and added to the total before it's passed to bitpay. Based on their terms of service it seems they don't directly handle tax collection.

Thank you so much for your continued patronage! We absolutely love hearing positive feedback, but we also value criticism. We can't improve if we don't know what we're doing wrong, so if there is any way we can better serve you in the future please do let us know!
We know that no one likes waiting around for their e-Liquid any longer than absolutely necessary, so our goal is to get all orders to the post office in less than 24 hours. Thanks again!

I'd say go with a high-VG (vegetable glycerine) ratio e-Liquid. 25%pg/75%vg would probably do it. VG is a much thicker base liquid, so it would be closer to the desired effect. 
Color might be a bit harder to handle. We don't stock any dyes for use in our e-Liquids, but most of the flavorings range from pale-yellow to pale amber in color. The caramel flavor is a pale amber and bitter-wizard flavors tend toward a darker brown. Pineapple would probably be pretty close to the right hue/translucency though. Again, this is all pretty subjective, so we'd have to work with you to find your preferred hue/thickness!
