 is gone, what can we use instead, to measure current segwit adoption?

I'm all for Bitcoin (I'm wasting my time here reading this subreddit, ain't I?) but some people treat the damn thing as some kind of religion instead of a financial tool.

There was far too much infrastructure and investment in taxis before Uber came along. There was far too much infrastructure and investment in Blockbuster before Netflix came along. There was far too much infrastructure and investment in Texaco before Tesla came along...

It may very well be the case. Good luck!

That's an option, thank you!

How can we know for sure? 10% of those wallets might be merchants. Or maybe 90%. All we can rely on are announcements.

The science is called statistics, not prophecy. It helps you find your best odds, not actual results. Geez, people complaining abou this must be the same who don't believe in global warming because tuesday was warm and not cold like the news man said it would be.

Adoption is actually going down. Expedia, steam, plenty of businessess are not accepting bitcoin anymore after the insane fees back in December.
There had been a reasonable increase in block size back then (say 2MB, I'm not talking about Bcash here) we would be living in a different world now.
Alas, the would be "customers" of Bitcoin were driven away and getting them back on board will take years.

5 years does not a hodler make?
In order to be a true hodler I have to hold the coins until I die and let my son use the money after I'm dead?

Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System - Satoshi Nakamoto.
This line of reasoning "it was always meant to be digital gold only came along when transactions stopped going through, back in October/November 2017.
@_date: 2018-06-13 13:23:28
So maybe the right move is to sell bitcoin now, buy some index fund and return in 5 years, when things are ready.
@_date: 2018-06-14 19:59:06
If we focus on adoption we'll be just as sad. 
Microsoft, Expedia, Steam, etc... bye-bye!
@_date: 2018-06-15 13:16:10
As a man, I wholeheartedly agree with what you said.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:28:08
I understand that but with Segwit adoption still at 37% I don't have much hope for a speedy development of the tech.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:43:09
Everything that was said, with the exception of block size, also applies to BCash. If one is giving up on Bitcoin BTC because of the reasons above it would also make sense to give up on Bitcoin Cash BCH.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:25:54
Obviously I was talking about merchant adoption.
Besides, everything that was said (with the exception of block size) also applies to BCash. If you are giving up on Bitcoin BTC because of the reasons above it would also make sense to give up on Bitcoin Cash BCH.

I'm still 6x or 7x my investment too. That doesn't mean I should hodl it all the way down to 1x before quiting. If I think this is the best I can do, the smart thing is to take my profits now.
Not saying that is the case. I may very well be wrong in the long run. Still... Just because you won 100 million at the lotto that doesn't mean that burning 99 million would be a good thing, cause you still would have 1 million free.

Again: Most wallets haven't even got to implementing segwit. A lightning wallet for iOS may take years.

It's not!? 
Then why bother developing the Lightning protocol?
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:58:47
Thank you for offering an alternative opinion! 
Again, I may very well be wrong on everything, that's a given. What I wanted to hear was this, arguments why I might be wrong so I could make a better decision.
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:09:00
I do remember 2013, that why I said I believe this time it's different and exposed the reasons above.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:32:34
Why now? Why not at 6,5k or 5,5k or 4,5k?
How can you be so sure this is the floor? It's the same thing people have been saying since it dropped from 20k to 19k.
@_date: 2018-06-12 13:29:47
Could you elaborate on the " it is snowballing" part? Not saying you're lying by any means, really interested in knowing what merchants are thinking when adoption Bitcoin now, when the price is only going down.
@_date: 2018-06-06 13:04:09
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:34:32
And there's always something to be learnt. Even if it is "well, they were  all wrong and this made me believe in the success of bitcoin even more."
@_date: 2018-06-11 21:09:30
Why? I never said I'm a bitcoin millionaire. For all you know I could have bought $5 of bitcoin back in 2013 and have $230 now.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:30:31
Thank you anyway. Given the other comments, this is one of the most objective and thought out replies.
@_date: 2018-06-11 13:37:46
In theory, yes. In practice he is an authoritarian man who will ban the cryptocurrency just as soon as he realizes it is a threat to him. Newspapers are "fake news", the FBI is in a "witch hunt" and bitcoin will be "criminals fake money"

TLTL (too little, too late)
Had this happened before Microsoft, STEAM and many others jumped off the bitcoin as a payment method wagon, this would actually mean something.
@_date: 2018-11-05 18:26:56
50% almost one year later after an enormous drop from ATH... TLTL (too little, too late)
@_date: 2018-11-23 18:57:38
Didn't you get the memo? Bitcoin is now a peer to peer store of value system.
@_date: 2018-11-27 13:17:30
This is how fanaticism works. Facts that go against your beliefs are the work of the devil, who's testing you. You are right in believing, you have always been right in believing, it's the world out there, made of wicked sinners, that's trying to push you away from the righteous path. Pay no mind and keep praying though, in the end Satosh... God, will reward you, though.

Oops, wrong quote. Edited.
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:21:04
Back in November/2017 the network was slow and fees were high. So, instead of fixing that, a bunch of smart asses (who, to this day, refuse to see the problems with bitcoin) decided it would be, from then on, some sort of "store of value" instead of a "peer to peer cash system. They told we would all be better spending fiat on credit card and letting bitcoin be our electronic vault or something like that.
Now that this strategy didn't work, I wonder what they'll say next.
They'll probably tell you that bitcoin is a form of art and will cost more and more because Satoshi, like Van Gogh, are both retired and won't produce other works anymore.

Those who would sacrifice adoption to purchase a little temporary 1 MB block, have neither and lost both, look at what the BCH and now BSV forks have done to the 20k BTC - Real Life

Nothing is clear in it, as it is a retarded statement. We all can afford losing everything we have. Look at beggars in the streets: they have nothing, not 1 cent in their pocket. Still, they live. They can breath, talk, ask for food... There is no point where you "lost too much" and you just suddenly die.  
Also, "feeling the pain" is not something reserved for the overinvested. If you are a billionaire and you lose a tennis match you may very well "feel the pain" and yet it cost you nothing.

Let's make an analogy here. Think about football: you have your amateur football team and you play with your buddies every sunday. Can the team ever "enter a death spiral"? No, because you have nothing at stake there. You lose a game, that's fine. Someone stops playing, you get somenone else to play in their position.
Now suppose you're the owner of the NY Jets. Can you "enter a death spiral" now? You absolutely can. You lose too many games, people stop going to the stadium and you end up bankrupt. Some A-list player stops playing, you can't get someone to replace him as you have no money. The IRS comes asking for their share and you can't pay them? The team is over, done with, history.
You all have to understand there will come a point where bitcoin will be just "too big to fail", the same way it happens with big companies and banks (whether we've reached that point is up for debate, but it's there somewhere) - but the difference here is that there is no taxpayer money to bail Bitcoin out. That means that, should it get too big to fail and should it fail, that's it. That's a domino effect that sends the damn thing back to its "stone age", with Bitcoin Diamond taking its place because GPU miners will not be willing to wait years for the difficult adjustment on the BTC chain.

" If you’re here for the tech then..." - This is such a stupid concept, why does "being here for the tech" entails anything? Can't I be here "for the tech" and also not go bankrupt, the same way that "I'm there for my kids", supporting them, but that does not mean I will be happy if they end up as beggars in the street?
