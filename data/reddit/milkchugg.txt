Fiat on Coinbase is FDIC insured though. I’m not sure if that’s applicable to this case, but they do have some sort of regulation versus other fraudulent companies. When you store your money with CB, it’s as good as a bank.

Lines over here bud.

Ah, and here this whole time I thought everyone was cashing out to Fiats.

Don’t invest more at this point. If you’re investing half of what’s in your bank account, you’re doing it wrong. You got lucky with your one BTC. Keep it or sell it.

With Coinbase, your money is insured. I'm not 100% sure with GDAX, but I don't know if that insurance applies. Someone can correct me if I'm wrong.

Yeah I am. Somethings going on and I think it’s more than just “everyone’s excited about the new updates”. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:53:53
But when will the dump start? 18k? 50k? 100k? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:23:30
Man, I was going to make this joke yesterday. I bought a decent chunk and immediately thought, "this is it, we're going down"
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:32:10
You too, happy holidays!
@_date: 2017-12-08 05:57:37
Yeah wtf? It’s not adding up at all. How do you create an entire bot based on bitcoin, and then claim that you had no idea what bitcoin even was?
@_date: 2017-12-27 23:51:37
Shit man. Have you kind of just gotten over it by now, or is it something that you still think about a lot? 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:01:59
This is what makes me think that of it does crash, it won’t be as bad as people think. If it crashes to say, $1000, do you not think that everyone would jump on that shit and drive the price straight back up? I know I would. 
BTC is hitting mainstream now, where people who had no idea what crypto even was just a month ago are already starting to buy into it. 
Now that we’ve seen just how high BTC can get, I don’t think it will drop considerably without spiking up jus as high soon after. There are simply too many people waiting for that drop to happen, and if it does, it will be bought up in an instant. 
That’s just my speculation though.

Sorry, I misunderstood the post.
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:21:55
I wouldn’t matter too much. If the price fluctuates too much, there’s nothing you could do in any case. But the chance to buy and sell at a margin may be worth the risk. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:24:23
God that would be horrible. It’s not even like you invested a ton upfront and lost. You just got extremely lucky investing a small amount, you’re life is on the edge of being better forever, all you have to do is sell, but you keep watching those number inch up. Then all of the sudden, boom, gone. 
It’s something that all of us can and will fall into. “Should I sell or just waiting a *little* longer?” That’s what makes this current BTC spike so scary. There’s just no telling how far this thing will go. 
@_date: 2017-12-28 00:00:06
Well, at the very least, you’ll be sort of a Twitter legend for as long as BTC is around. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:28:08
I mean, it'll realistically likely make you a few bucks, but I still don't think it's worth taking half of your checking account. You're trying to get pennies when you've already made thousands. Let your current coin keep marinating and consider that your investment. With 1 coin in the game, you're doing *much* better than most people at the moment.

Decentralizing currency. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 00:09:06
Because the guy on TV said the thing about bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:10:07
Yeah, I just tend to bring bad luck wherever I go or with whatever I do. I thought the fact that I spent a good amount (at least for me) on BTC, I was solely going to cause the Great Bitcoin Crash of 2017.

Why would you give you private key away in the first place?
