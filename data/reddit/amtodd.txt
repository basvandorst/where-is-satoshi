If it was tried then it would be true and not a lie though right?

Why not sell it for Bitcoin?

What timeline do you mean by "ready to go"?

And thank god I chose a higher fee to send or else I'd have wasted a whole day.

I worked to cut down on the confusion in this redesign. We sell both, our wallet supports both, our mining pool mines both. So when we say that you can buy bitcoin from us or store bitcoin in our products we are referring to both.
We worked to further visually differentiate them in the wallet and our other products, with BCH green and BTC orange. Thought this redesign would have made some of you guys happy?
There's no intention to scam anyone. If someone did accidentally have a BCH  wallet, and buys BCH from us and sends that BCH to their wallet while intending it to be BTC, they can simply shift it over to a BTC address using [sideshift.ai]( that's built into our wallet. Easy fix.
Yes, I do choose to get paid in BCH, but could also get paid in BTC or any other currency. I diversify me holdings between different crypto.
BCH is definitely the currency that I transact in the most frequently. I purchase all my flights and hotels with it. Check out [beachhub.com]( in Thailand. Great coworking/coliving space that accepts BCH. I spend a lot of time in Tokyo and frequent bars and restaurants that accept it. They have delicious Bitcoin Cash IPA on tap at 2 Dogs Taproom.  Give it a try if you're ever there for a visit.
If you're actually transacting with it in your day to day life, the differences become more apparrent. A couple weeks ago I met up with a guy in person for a trade and he wanted BTC. So I sent him the BTC and then we sat around in a coffee shop awkwardly for an hour waiting for it to confirm.
While we sat there and waited I showed him how we could send back and forth BCH over and over, probably thousands of times in the time it took to confirm our BTC transaction. So when I met up with him a second time the other day the he accepted BCH. The  transaction took a second and we were both on our way.

Thanks for letting me know. Seems to be working fine for me right now. It's an iframe loaded from our processor that will vary depending on your location. Your problem might be fixed with a VPN

It's 2.5% [Bitcoin.com]( charges for both BTC and BCH
@_date: 2019-06-18 18:03:03
Our team designed the site. Would love to hear why you think that.

It's 2.5% to Bitcoin.com not 25% with a 5% fee to Simplex.
@_date: 2019-06-18 19:28:09
Try with a higher amount. For the Simplex processing fee they charge 5% OR a $10 minimum. Prices are set by Simplex the processor, not Bitcoin.com
@_date: 2019-06-19 03:45:27
2.5% on both

Our redesign doesn't use the upright logo. We've removed the B completely from the logo.
If you'd like some more insight into our reasoning behind the decisions we made for rebrand here's an article: [

Cheaper and faster. Pasting this story in from my comment above:

Try the same and tell me which you prefer.

Not related to bitcoin or you would see something similar with the search term "bitcoin"
