There are no "internal" transactions. Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain. So it has to mined and you have to pay a fee.

Yes, do your research and own decisions. That's the best recommendation I can give you.
Related to GDAX wihdrawal fees. This just means that they don't charge additional fees. Transaction fees still apply.

You don't have the private key of your coinbase acc. That's why you should store "larger" amounts in a wallet your control, i.e. of which you know the private key. So everything you can see in your acc is to public key.

Ok, basically the public key is derived from the private key. You need the private key to sign your transactions, like a PIN. The public key is your account number. This is the information others need to send you coins.
That's why you should keep your private key PRIVATE and your corresponding public key PUBLIC.
To transfer coins from coinbase open your wallet, press send and enter your public key. First, try to transfer a small amount.

depends on you own Definition of "best Exchange". if you want low fees, than find the Exchange with the lowest fees for you. If you prefer a specific way to deposit/withdraw fiat that could be another exchange. So, there are many way to define "best", that's why you should consider to research exchanges on your own.

shouldn't there be a sticker or any information if customs open packages?

Kraken is an exchange. Such online wallets are called hot wallets. Cold wallets/storage means offline.
 It's not a matter of security how they are named. Keep your private keys save, and don't store too much money or crypto in exchanges. In the latter case, exchanges hold the private key, not you. They have the full control over it.

The best way is a hardware wallet like Trezor or Ledger. The private key is never exposed online. You can also use a paper wallet, but for max security you should then sign your transactions offline. It's easier to use hardware wallets, because you just have to plug them in and there your go.
