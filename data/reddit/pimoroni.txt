I know the feeling! Point her our way when she's looking... ;-)

We're based in Sheffield so yes, we ship UK! :-)
Edit: a grammar

During checkout there is an option to use "BitPay" they handle all the conversion for us.
I am working on having a currency translator on the site but it isn't ready yet...

Thanks for the kind words :-)

Ahh! Ok, because Norway is not part of the EU we have to provide a customs declaration on anything we "export" there. Hope that answers your question even if it isn't the answer you wanted to hear!

Hi! Thanks for all the kind words (and sorry for the late response).
We are working to simplify EU shipping rates at the moment which should make them a simple two tier setup based on price (above/below £50). We currently do have a shipping estimator on the cart page though.
Thanks for the other suggestions we'll look into them! (And thanks for reminding me about Makey Makey!)

We look forward to providing them! We're constantly expanding our range too :-)
@_date: 2013-12-01 12:39:38
We ship worldwide!

I haven't seen many UK businesses accepting Bitcoin yet so I though I'd add us to the list!
We've been following Bitcoin keenly over the past couple of years and with the release of Bitpay integration into Shopify it became a no brainer to support it on our store :-)
We're also running some Long Black Friday Weekend deals at the moment!
@_date: 2013-12-01 18:34:41
We're really expanding our range at the moment as well so check back often! :-)

Sweet! The wide angle lens is fun :-)
@_date: 2013-12-01 17:59:59
Good point! We'll be adding the logo :-)

We do ship internationally - I'm not entirely sure about the rest of the question. We do declare the contents accurately if that's what you mean?
