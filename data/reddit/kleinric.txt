These programmes change lives, with kids reading and maths abilities being measurably improved in Lesedi. It costs about ZAR500 per child per month, which covers food (hungry kids can't learn), fees for the software that they use (lab online), and some physical resources (Lego, puzzles, stationery etc). 1btc (today's value) covers about 38 kids for a year - the programme takes almost 80 at the moment - so this would be significant funding for them. 
Happy to provide any proof necessary.
