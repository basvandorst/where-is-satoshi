Roads could be funded by anything from private organizations making their businesses more accessible to subscription services like you have for GPS plans or public transportation, or even sponsoring by advertisers. Free roads. There are many, many alternatives beyond those. The cool thing is that, if you don't allow criminals to just steal your money and do whatever with it, they actually depend on customer satisfaction for their income.
Roads would be safer because dead customers aren't profitable. The companies providing the roads would be more efficient because they'd know which roads are profitable (being used) and which ones aren't (because nobody uses them).
Like everything, capitalism would be far more efficient at matching supply and demand in road production than government central planning. There would actually finally be an incentive to make mobility not suck.
And no, people wouldn't have to contribute out of the goodness of their own hearts. You'd just pay for things you actually use. Economic calculation. The reason why we don't starve.

Taxes decrease quality of life instead of improving it. Every good or service monopolized by the state can no longer be provided in a way that takes consumer demand into account. Socialism is just organized crime that preys on the weakest in society.

Google "economic calculation problem". I'd rather live in a country where people throw away food than Venezuela. 
Socialism is mathematically guaranteed to starve people because you can't calculate whether the demand for something is greater than the cost of producing it when resources have no prices. And resources have no prices to the government, because it just appropriates whatever it needs.
Example: if a taxi business steals all the cars in town, they have no cost of production because they didn't have to buy the cars. The taxi business will make a profit if they only provide one cab ride. Even though their actions immobilized an entire town and they never provided a legitimate service, they still make a profit and have no incentive to stop doing what they're doing.
That's why it's already illegal to commit socialism for all of us.

That's so stupid. The government doesn't provide roads and education. It steals those things out of society in the first place and then sells incredibly low quality rations of those things back to society in exchange for free tax slave labor. It's just organized crime.

Relative to fiat currencies, all commodities should be deflationary if their supply is limited and demand for them stays somewhat consistent. As the fiat currency supply expands, you'll have more fiat units bidding on the same amount of commodity units. So being deflationary relative to fiat would merely mean that the commodity maintains its objective value.
I didn't mean that we should burn a million bitcoin each year or anything.

Wouldn't it be cheaper for bitcoin millionaires to hire mercenaries and get rid of the IRS than fulfill the IRS' extortion demands at some point?
Not advising anyone to do this, but it would seem a logical conclusion from a business perspective.
The IRS is a terrorist organization of criminal agents acting on behalf of anonymous voters to extort and steal other people's money. It would only make sense that there would be an opposing force working on behalf of anonymous people who don't want to be stolen from.

True. I understand why inflation exists on paper, but we all know there is no exact way to predict how millions of individuals will react when you change one small parameter, like an interest rate or inflation rate. That's where the velocity of money comes in. 
You could, for example, inflate the monetary supply today by 2% today, and depending on how fast new money trickles from the central bank all the way down to the average consumer, that 2% inflation could translate into a 2% price increase this year, next year, in ten years, or maybe even twenty.
The problem is that central bankers are shooting in the dark when they inflate the monetary supply with the aim of stimulating an economy. At some point, they will mistakenly assume that their inflation wasn't enough because it hasn't shown up as a 2% price increase yet, and so they inject more money. Then, when the inflation does "hit" after several years, they realize they overshot, and they're stuck with a 4% price increase out of nowhere. 
Or, God forbid, Venezuelan hyperinflation where consumer prices double every week or so if they really go too far.
Keynesian economics is generally the school of economic thought you'll be taught in public education. It assumes that governments and central bankers have some sort of mystical knowledge that the markets don't have, and that central planners should therefore at least control spending. Kind of communism light.
@_date: 2017-11-01 10:53:51
Yes, inflation incentivizes investing. IRRESPONSIBLE investing. Especially at low interest rates. In a deflationary economy, which is natural, any debt would become harder to pay off the longer it stretches over time. This would incentivize people to only take out loans if they're fairly sure they'll be able to create the additional value needed to pay off the loan. And it would incentivize people to only invest if there's a reasonable expectation of steady growth in the investment. Hence, RESPONSIBLE investing.
In an inflationary monetary system, debt becomes easier to pay off over time. Add low interest rates, and it's like handing out free gambling money. So now you have millions of people taking out loans to buy regular consumer goods and wild speculation in financial markets, but little actual value being created.
The problem with Keynesian economics is that it doesn't put any value at all in the localized, specialized knowledge that individuals require to do economic calculation and match supply to a real demand. Keynesian economics has a huge contempt  for the market and the way in which it organizes the knowledge of millions of individuals. To Keynesians, all spending is equal. All investments are equal.
Which is simply not true.

Governments don't provide any services. All they do is steal services out of society in the first place, by forcefully monopolizing them. Then, they ration overpriced, low quality rations of those services back to society in return for free tax slave labor.
You know this is true.
When a baker makes bread and competes with other bakers to sell it to you, that's a legitimate service.
When a baker shoots up all the other bakeries and forces you to work several months of the year for free in exchange for shit tier bread, that's called organized crime.
As a European, I don't want to pay jack shit for the police or the military because they have objectively made society less safe and actively keep us from defending ourselves against foreign invaders. And because these order following pussies monopolize our right to defend ourselves, we're completely fucked.

Because governments are where society puts people with no marketable skills.

So what? An ounce of gold is more valuable than a dollar, and gold's transaction times are brutal compared to bitcoin's. Mass spending (selling) is usually an indicator of low value.

You might want to spread your investments out over time. For example, bitcoin price is high right now because everyone expects to get free money with the upcoming forks. After this is over, it might drop in price, a lot.

Sure, branding and big money don't make a good coin. But could be indicators for investors who just want the price to go up.
Bitcoin also has been a target of negative media coverage and political BS. Still too many people think it's drug dealer/terrorist money. Especially here in Europe.
I also feel bad about introducing people to bitcoin when they have to pay more fees and wait longer for transactions to confirm than with a regular bank. This will bother the store owner down the road, too. You can't run a business on payments that take 24h to go through and might lose 10% in dollar value in the interim. Not so much with ethereum.

Dude. The EU Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker's father, Joseph Juncker, was literally in the Nazi Wehrmacht. Jean-Claude Juncker literally married the daughter of Hitler's propaganda commissar, a guy named Frising. How's that for fascists?
Other members of the EU Commission are guys like Barosso, who was a member of a Maoist communist party in his early political career, and Pierre Moscovici, a radical Trotskyist communist, currently in charge of economics. That's just the tip of the iceberg.
How on earth is an irrevocable submission to these absolute piles of human excrement somehow a better option than putting up with five years of Le Pen?

If you were sure about your investment, you wouldn't be checking up on the price all the time. Part of why you're keeping track of it is probably because you don't want to miss THE point where it's time to sell.

Besides, you should be blaming this problem on fiat currencies, not bitcoin. Central banks are creating this "investing, not spending" mindset by inflating their currency supply, which guarantees that their currencies will devalue over time. If central banks stopped printing fiat currency out of thin air, the dollar value of bitcoin wouldn't rise forever, and people would be more eager to spend instead of hoard it.

Honestly, as a guy who used to write software, the markets right now are exactly the kind of volatile but controlled environment you want to find weaknesses and solutions before you roll your software out to the wider public.

You can't have more people using a finite product without the price going up.Limited supply + rising adoptation/demand = higher price. More people bidding on the same supply means sellers can ask more. That's basic economics.

Sadly, governments don't generally benefit from a functioning economy, because they kinda become obsolete when people do well. EU leadership is mostly radical communists who don't believe people should own private property at all. Pierre Moscovici, EU Commissioner for economics and entrepreneurship, for example, used to be in a party called the "Revolutionary Communist League".
People like that are never going to allow prosperity and human progress. They will ban private ownership of cryptocurrencies whenever they can get away with it.

Actually, running wouldn't work unless the speed is already really slow, because running requires you to put at least one foot on the ground and push your body weight up. Which you can't do because of the momentum. So before you can do the running motion and switch feet, you'd most likely be kissing the floor.
This is why you roll.

Lol. Have you heard of specialized tax investigators here in Europe? Technically, police are restrained by a lot of regulations like warrants, 24-hour detainment, stuff like that, but tax investigators aren't.
They're like legalized government theft squads in the EU. If the state doesn't like what you're doing, they send the tax guys out to confiscate your entire business. They can keep "evidence" as long as the "investigation" lasts, which can pretty much be indefinitely.
It's worse than civil asset forfeiture, because "owing taxes" is a crime you're guilty of by default, and they will spare no expense to investigate whether you're paying your "fair share", even if you flawlessly file your taxes each year and there is no wrongdoing to be found.
We even have an epidemic of these tax scumbags picking on wealthy elderly people. They know that a 90-year-old widow will get absolutely crushed by a large scale tax investigation, even if she's completely innocent. 
Don't be fooled. The system wants your money and the crooks have no shame whatsoever.

Civil asset forfeiture is nasty. You're considered guilty until proven innocent. It's basically just the state robbing you. Only a professional can help you with that. Maybe. The last thing you want to do is walk up to the cops and the IRS and just say "hey guys, I suddenly have millions of dollars, wanna come check it out?" 
Talk to your bank and maybe cash out the money in chunks so they don't have to report suspicious activity and stuff like that. Get a tax accountant. Be honest but discreet with all parties.

I'm European and the EU has most of these things already in place. So it's certainly not an American thing. 
Fight it! You have a God given right to transact with other people without complete strangers looking over your shoulder.

In my case, doing it 100% "by the book" would have landed me in a situation where I wouldn't be able to access the money for a while, so I split it up over different banks instead. Obviously I wasn't evading taxes and I reported everything as I should, so I don't see why they'd make a big deal out of it. OP's situation may differ.
Disclaimer: I am not a US citizen and I did have proof of where the funds came from. Laws may be different, but principle remains: don't deposit millions into your $20k bank account in one deposit without letting them know beforehand.

Nope. Once your provider implements this, you'll still have the sim card and the credit, but they won't allow you to use it on their network unless you register your identity. That's what happened here in Belgium.
The decision came from the EU Commission but I do believe countries were given a year or so to implement it, so it might not be implemented everywhere at the same time. It's coming, though.
They pushed it through in Belgium in like a month's time or so.

I know, but depending on the country you're in, they may not have a choice. Over here, I think every transaction over €20k has to be reported to the government under terrorism laws. I guess the US has similar BS in place.

Well, if I didn't "structure", they'd have frozen the funds until they could investigate the origins. That would have taken months, and I was in a hurry to cash out. They really made it impossible for me to do it 100% by the book, because apparently, the system is made to keep plebs like me right where they are.

The government of my country used fiat to give the Paris attack terrorists social housing and free driver's licenses. Several governments worldwide have been busted running billion dollar drug and gun trafficking operations. The EU openly uses euros to fund human trafficking when they pick up illegal migrants in Libya. The list goes on and on. Not to mention that child traffickers like Dutroux were obviously funded by my country's tax money.
In light of the fact that government is by definition a monopoly on crime, I think the world will survive if some stoner buys some online weed anonymously.
@_date: 2017-06-12 12:02:12
True. That's why you talk to your bank. They have to notify authorities when deposits are above a limit they set for you, at least where I live. 
You want to avoid that, because dealing with a frozen bank account is time consuming, so explain the situation beforehand and see what your bank suggests.
Source: I have split a deposit over different banks in the past just to avoid having to justify deposits that went over my limits and would freeze my account.

So is the "crime and terrorism" argument against payment anonymity. Should fork manufacturers stop selling forks until they figure out a foolproof mechanism to prevent their forks from ever being used in a crime? That's just ridiculous.
If crypto crime is so prevalent that it worries people, they should point it out. They should present numbers on the percentage of transactions used for crime. They should at least prove that there is a significant problem.
The tenacity of this argument worries me because totalitarian governments like the EU are already using this kind of imaginary crime as an excuse to crack down on people's right to privately transact without Big Brother looking over their shoulder.
@_date: 2017-06-11 09:06:12
Many banks have limits per transaction or daily limits. Maybe you went over that by selling a lot in one transaction. Next time, let your bank know in advance if you're sending an unusual amount of money to your account.
It sucks that we still have to deal with primitive stuff like this, but that's just the way it is for now.

What about exchanges? Are you "holding" the cryptocurrencies if you have $25k on Poloniex or Coinbase or whatever?

Upper income tax brackets will see the IRS stealing 50% of your income. Capital gains in my country is 30%. I don't know how much the IRS steals. Converting gains to fiat is like writing a huge paycheck to people who steal for a living. No decent person likes to reward thieves.

I used to do that, too, but recently, all phone providers in my country were instructed to register their users' identities. We literally got text messages from our providers that they would discontinue service and we wouldn't be able to make calls or text without registering.

Since earlier this year, any sort of anonymous prepaid cards have been banned by the EU Commission. You are not able to text or call people without registering your identity in the EU, for example. Also, anonymous digital payments are made impossible without anonymous prepaid credit cards. 
They're working on gradually banning cash as well.
This whole nonsense of declaring your crypto holdings has also been in place at EU borders for a few months. Actually, here, it's more like civil asset forfeiture, where they can just suspect you of a crime and "confiscate" all crypto holdings they can find on you.
