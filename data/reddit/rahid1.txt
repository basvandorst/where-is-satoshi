Hey guys hopefully someone gets to me fast I'm buying it slowly buttt what this fork thing and should I leave my coins on Coinbase
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:08:28
Lmao I can't even pay out that much for BTC
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:08:12
Can't afford 7k for BTC atm but it's still rising which is great
@_date: 2017-11-14 06:10:20
Yeah just saw a video it's really simple actually how it and what it means
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:09:05
Hmmm still if you could afford pay 1k I guess
@_date: 2017-11-04 16:08:42
I know but I wouldn't get a good return

Everyone can be right or wrong about something will have to see why he thought it wouldn't work out. No can predict the future correctly

Thanks all I'm still trying to figure out how to get out of Coinbase probably or just keep that instead as I do believe that this will be safe for now. Will have to look into cold paper storage which is risky as well from losing the USB to it breaking down etc everything has an issue.

Mine personally around  2-3 BTC but if I considered taking on my dad debt it would be a lot more ������
