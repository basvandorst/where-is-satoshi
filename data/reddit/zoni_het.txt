A very simple table with the number of Segwit transactions in a block can be seen here, updating with each new block. Might be helpful for the moment.

[A quick graph is here.]( Just close the "sign up" window that might pop up. I really hope that the usual block explorer sites add this feature soon.

SegWit has been activated one block later. Seven SegWit transactions in the first block, two in the second block, one in the third block.

Until there are nicer tools: you can monitor the raw number of Segwit transactions per block here: [

Raw data can be seen here: [segwit.5gbfree.com]( Sorry, no graphs. I am sure some nicer tools will come up soon.

Yes, it's 1/12 or 8.3%. See [segwit.5gbfree.com/countsegwit.html](

I think 144 is ok - it is a binary decision per transaction, not per block. So the numbers are higher and relative variance smaller.

I assume the coinbase transaction is counted if it includes the witness commitment (all blocks since 481824) -&gt; 2/12 or 16.67%
