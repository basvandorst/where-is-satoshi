There might be decent arguments that they aren't going to deliver products that hit their claimed hash-rates,  but I don't see why anyone would think they were a scam.  This isn't their first bitcoin mining product.

No ones using Bitcoinica anymore.  The site is no more.  However,  the last time they got hacked,  they locked down the bitcoins/cash of all its users.  They were *supposed* to be working on getting at least half of the coins back to them.  However,  I'm not entirely sure what the fuck they've been doing this whole time,  as they've not sent coins out to tons of people that they personally said were verified,  all the while they've have 10's of thousands of coins sitting on MtGox. 
This is all starting to sound like an inside job. 
@_date: 2012-07-13 21:27:18
the only thing that would hurt the price is if the "hacker"  (bitcoinica) tries to dump all of the coins it stole from itself at once. 
@_date: 2012-07-13 21:22:14
So if they've had 40k coins sitting on MtGox this whole time, and I've been "verified" for weeks,  THEN WHY THE FUCK DO I NOT HAVE MY FUCKING COINS BACK?
@_date: 2012-12-22 04:38:43
If you count bitcoinica as a scam,  I lost 500 coins that I mined.

These stories about people not breaking even sure makes me feel better.  I dropped about 5k on mining equipment in June of last year I broke even a few months ago. Though I will admit that I held onto them when the prices were low there for a few months,  and I also don't pay for electricity.

separate pixel shaders and vertex shaders haven't existed since the Nvidia 7xxx and ATI 1xxx series.  Since that point,  the shaders have been all purpose.  What you're calling "pixel shaders"  are the ROP's, which are just texturing units.  What you're calling "geometry shaders" are tesselators.

@_date: 2011-06-14 07:05:53
i never called rop's pixel shaders,  i also stated that the 7xxx series was the last one to have separate shaders.  Did you even read the post you responded to?

6950 1 gig cards seem to be a good sweet spot currently.   Me and my roomie are about to get 12 of them at 208 apiece after mailin rebate.  we plan to put 3 to a rig.  With a little overclocking each rig should do about 1 g/hash apiece.  
 
@_date: 2011-06-14 05:12:29
Nvidia cards aren't even necessarily better at FPU calculations,   it's just that the route ATI took involved lots of smaller, less complex shaders vs nvidias larger more complex shaders.  A byproduct of ATI's route allows it to process integers much faster.   In the case of integers,  Nvidias shaders aren't any faster than ATI's shaders,  and ATI has a lot more shaders.

@_date: 2011-06-08 04:45:58
the cards themselves were right around 3 g's.   each rig will end up being right around 1100-1200 apiece i think.  I went with ASrock tri-sli AM3 mobos and athlon II X2's and Corsair 950w PSU's.   Each rig i build from now on will be from profits made from mining.  I plan to keep scaling until i hit the power limits with my house. I figure i can get 8-10 going maybe.  I need to see just how much power they'll pull.  I figure probably 7.5 amps apiece or so.    After i reach the limit,  im not sure.  rent an office building maybe?   I've actually considered getting a large loan so that I can go balls-out asap.  
@_date: 2011-06-16 07:19:15
From what I understand,   the reason the hash rate always seems really high right after difficulty changes,  is that blocks from the previous set are being figured into that number.  Meaning,  it thinks we did 100 blocks or so,  at 877k difficulty that we did at 570k,  artificially inflating the hash rate.  
It has done this every time that i've noticed.  It should even out in the next day or 2.  We're probably legitimately approaching 8 t/hash though.

@_date: 2011-09-15 07:39:21
A Radeon Core is a Stream Processor,  but a Stream Processor is not the same thing as a Vertex Shader.   Stream Processors handle vertex shading, but they also handle pixel shading and geometry shading.   ATI and Nvidia did away with separate pixel and vertex shaders for more robust shaders that can do everything.
@_date: 2011-06-15 02:31:16
theres just nothing extra for the shader to do,  since it's just simple integer calculations,  so ATI wins based on sheer volume
@_date: 2011-06-05 17:31:06
At this point in time, There's no real point to running anything but an AMD/ATI based OpenCL miner.   CPU's are completely pointless,  and the newest Nvidia cards are only comparable to ATI cards from 2 generations ago.

I thought they recently announced that they were switching to SIMD?  Also,  the difference between the 7970 and 7950 is very small. 
@_date: 2011-07-22 02:20:21
12k t/hash = 40k or so 300 m/hash GPU's.   Lets say that each card sells for 200 dollars.  that's only 8 million dollars,  and that's if you're adding up the actual retail price of the cards,  which AMD certainly doesn't get 100% of.     Their total revenue for this last quarter was 1.57 billion dollars.  So as you can see,  we're talking about a fraction of a percent of AMD's overall revenue.  
@_date: 2011-10-05 06:53:06
Dunno what qualified me specifically.  Having over 400 coins in volume in the last 30 days maybe?

tradehill is back up.  Prices are still above 10 dollars and most people are holding above 20.    While im sure this whole ordeal will make things pretty volatile for a few days,  I think things will straighten out. Too many people want to see this thing succeed.    Hopefully MtGox and other exchanges learned from this mess and will make security a top priority.

AMD has already confirmed a switch to SIMD from VLIW for Southern Island.   VLIW is what gave AMD the mining advantage over Nvidia,  SIMD is what Nvidia uses.  It remains to be seen how AMD's implementation handles something like bitcoin,  but all bets are that there wont be much, if any performance improvement for mining over the previous 2 generations,   though it might be more power efficient.

Firstly,  people will get out at different times.  Secondly,  if you're wise,  you'll get cards that people will still want as gamers a few months from now.   the 5830's are selling out like crazy,  but 6950's aren't.  
@_date: 2011-08-16 07:44:09
It's not soldering that's the problem,  just the potential for imperfections in the lithography to break loose.   
If you keep temps below 90c,  you should  be fine.   Keep in mind that overclocking and overvolting *does* reduce lifespan,   but assuming you're not upping the voltage by more than 10-15%,  and keeping temps below 90c,  you're talking about the difference between a 20 year lifespan stock and a 10 year lifespan overclocked,  which i'm sure is probably a good bit longer than you'd ever keep it.

@_date: 2013-04-12 10:12:55
This whole thing has just been a mess really.  It's turned mostly into negative publicity.  
Basically, after about a year and a half or so of Bitcoin steadily growing, a bunch of people come out of nowhere due to nothing but the price, and have no grasp of what Bitcoin really is other than what some moron on the news said about it. They see how positive all of us are about Bitcoin,  buy into the hype, and then some get screwed because they didn't understand what they were getting into.  
Meanwhile, a lot of arm-chair economists, who don't even know enough to separate MtGox from Bitcoin itself,  start watching from a distance, and decide that we're all a bunch of tulip-crazed, Monopoly money nut-jobs trying to drag people into our pump-and-dump ponzi-scheme so we can take all of their money,  and we are delusional for thinking Bitcoin could ever work, because it isn't "backed by government" (even though not a single one of them could tell you what the fuck that means.)  Not realizing that our previous enthusiasm wasn't really even about the price.  
I personally had seen the price over the last year and a half or so, as an indicator of how Bitcoin was *really* doing.  I won't deny that at first, I was hoping that the price started going up recently because Bitcoin was gaining legitimate mainstream traction, and perhaps it was. But it's become clear that the general public simply isn't ready yet, and that the Bitcoin community isn't really ready for it either.

@_date: 2013-04-12 10:17:57
The only way this can happen though, is if Bitcoin grows steadily.  It seemed like that's what had been going on for the last year and a half,  but this recent bubble shows that the infrastructure simply cannot handle large amounts of publicity.   We'll get there one day,  but I think we all need to stop and realize that Bitcoin simply isn't something that will be able to handle blowing up overnight anytime soon.
@_date: 2013-08-09 07:08:37
It is.  I try to just look at it as a giant anarchist-nerd experiment that happens to have made me money in the process.  I'll be very surprised if it lasts long-term,  but I feel that it has at least gotten people to think about what money is, and what makes money worth something.  
The government has traditionally been there to prevent scams etc,  but I think it could be pretty cool if the community itself got to the point where they were good at avoiding them.  A good example would be the bull-traps that someone was doing on Mt Gox around the time it peaked out a few months ago.  For a while,  it was wreaking havoc on the price,  but then people finally figured out what was going on,  and started ignoring it.

I still don't think it was a bad decision.  Unless the BFL building catches on fire,  I'll get my singles and have them making a profit long before the difficulty gets too high.  They're only a couple of days from shipping singles from my order date. 
Out of curiosity,  do you have any clue what you're talking about?  BFL was a legit company shipping legit FPGA miners when I pre-ordered,  which was probably months before you even knew what a bitcoin was.

I've been skeptical of bitcoin prices from the beginning,  but let's all be honest here,  bitcoin is on the cusp of going mainstream, and I'm starting to have a different opinion.
 When you look at the foundation of bitcoin 2 years ago, when they were at 30 dollars,  can you honestly say that it's publicity and the marketplace has only doubled since then?  If this is a bubble,  it's relatively a lot smaller than the last one at this point. 
This shit is just getting started folks.  The naysayers are still saying all the exact same shit about Bitcoin that they've always said, and if any of it were true,  we would have found out by now don't you think?

More expensive up front anyway.  Anyone who got in the first wave could have made 100 thousand dollars or more with one rig assuming they held the coins and sold them at the right time.

Yeah, sorry for getting defensive,  half the people in this sub-Reddit act like they "knew" better from the beginning and that BFL is mining with everyones units or whatever.  Just figured you were one of those.

Port settings are the main thing youd lose, and it doesn't sound like thats an issue.

The last thing we need is this sack of shit becoming the face of bitcoin.

You probably thought 8 dollars was a bubble too.

Everyone getting their shit out of MtGox?

At first it was just the money.   i jumped in with a dozen 6950's in the middle of the first bubble,  but as time passes,  the more I realize that I'm a fan of anything the government can't get its grubby hands on.

I can't believe someone would buy one of those without even having a grasp on the current state of difficulty increases.

So, something that you personally cant explain doesnt make sense unless your conspiracy theory is true?  Sure thing.

You guys are seriously retarded. A single person/company suddenly coming online would reveal itself because we can see wbo solves blocks. The rising hashrate has been pretty much accounted for and if some new address suddenly started solving a sizeable amount of blocks, wed have known.

Yeah, they experienced delays on a new technology. Total scam for sure.
