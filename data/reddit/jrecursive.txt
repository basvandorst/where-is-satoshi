the vertex in the very middle is the account that aggregated all the amounts from the leaves.  the boxes are bitcoin addresses.  outbound edges from boxes point to inputs of a transaction.  the outgoing edges from transactions indicate outputs of that transaction (to another bitcoin address).  this is not a comprehensive graph; i made it in part to show the structuring used to move bitcoin from some potential holding addresses to the address which is holding the aggregate.
i did make a few other versions.  this version --  -- shows the relative number of bitcoins transferred to and from each transaction as edge thickness.  the edges themselves are also labelled with the btc value though they are obscured in many cases.  the addresses were also truncated to make a more manageable image.
the original size of the image for the submission is 10x larger.

another rendering, with color, transparency: 
red: inbound value to a txn
green: outbound value from a txn

yeah a bit.  for this i wanted to see an overall structure (by virtue of a layout algorithm; e.g., force-directed).
an explorer w/ something like d3 would be great and something i'll probably get around to.  if you manage to stand one up i'd love to see it.
i did make a graph renderer that uses webgl using the js graph layout library arbor.js (which is very nice).  if i do it, i'll base it on that and post it here.
good idea :)

i harvested the data over time from various sources including of course the blockchain.  all the etl, graph preprocessing and graph data itself was in java and scripting languages.  i rendered the image with graphviz (fdp renderer).

i did dip my toe a bit in that using cytoscape but was following other leads at the time.  
re: data, sure, why not :)  i whipped up a quick transform for the small set of edges.  here you go: 
format: 
&lt;from-vertex&gt; \t &lt;to-vertex&gt; \t &lt;btc-value&gt;
i would love to see what you come up with.

yeah, most definitely.  i cooked these up last night and this morning with a couple of spare cycles.  i wanted to get something out that looked interesting, at a minimum.  i'll get some better ones done and reply here.  thanks for checking it out :)

this is a very, very small slice of the entire body of data i've aggregated.  less than 1%.  the problem is in graph layout and image generation (these processes require a significant amount of system resources and in many cases, with typical tools, are not parallelized).
my intent was to get a glimpse of the last stages of seizure.  this is interesting to me because looking over the greater body of my data, it struck me how the government had set up some kind of a system to structure the flow of SR proceeds to their aggregate account (instead of sending the amounts directly).
i've some ideas as to why this might be, but i'm not confident in any of my theories at the moment.  the data is somewhat tricky to work with (there is a lot of it, i am one person, etc.).
tldr the network shown in the image is like looking at 10 pixels square on a 4K display.

there is a high probability i will end up following the flow out of this account, though if a government TLA wants to fog the coins, they will likely succeed in creating such a magnificent shitstorm the average joe like me will have a very low probability of unravelling it.
my intuition tells me they might just leave this as bitcoin.  we all know how handy bitcoin can be when you need to move value and conduct  relatively "atypical transactions".  the likelihood of somebody who accepts bitcoin to take the initiative to get a picture of the origin of the bitcoin (probabilistic as it may be) they're receiving is extremely low.

and finally, a pruned version, laid out hierarchically:

try this: 
if you want some partial raw data, here are the graphviz .dot edge entries for an early rendering i did (newer ones have pensize, weights, etc.): 
i could probably throw the latest edge list up if you really want it for some reason (all of the changes are derivable from the edges linked to above, fwiw).

see my comment above regarding format; here is a meaningful subset of the data in TSV format if you want to do some hacking on your own:
would love to see / hear about anything you come up with.

thanks:) structure from "data in the wild" always fascinates me.
@_date: 2013-11-03 00:58:00
thanks:)  there is.  it's tricky to work with the data in this way with resources i can use for personal projects such as this (mostly due to data volume in conjunction with the nature of the algorithms in play).
the trick is going to be coming up with good questions that when answered produce usable and succinct data sets amenable to visualization.
we'll see :)

a combination of blockchain web services, blockchain database parsing, &amp; small modifications to bitcoind to capture ongoing transactions (though i did this mostly to capture other data not reflected in this graph, it just happened to be useful).  if you would like to play with the data used to make the images linked to from this submission, go here:
