well, mentioning you were "accused of being an &lt;insert name&gt; shill" just perpetuates the polarization it arose from. Shilling accusations only end in doxing so they're not fair accusations on reddit, where the editorial integrity depends on the potential anonymity of the users. If anyone accuses anyone of being a shill in public, on reddit, they are just trolling. You can ignore them.

Oddly enough, it's an observable fact that the fed controls bitcoin price. If the fed stopped printing money backed by nothing and stopped allowing Banks to lend money they don't have, then the cost of Bitcoin would be flat and it would have little utility. But the fed can't control itself and no one can control the fed. So no one controls Bitcoin.

He's right that it will make more sense to use it to retire instead of usd but his concern is on the wrong axis. 
Retirement funds aren't safe unless they're out of the dollar. The US dollar has been falling in value as the fed inflates it into Oblivion. They won't stop,. He has it backwards. Bitcoin can help you survive the end of the dollar. It is not the cause of it. 
Terrible monetary policy and systemic corruption will kill the dollar, and hopefully die with it.
The disconnect t is that computer science is not all that is in Bitcoin.  Economics and game theory are wrapped up in it just as deep as compsci.

Technically you're right the treasury prints money. The fed creates it out of thin air by allowing the banks to lend 10 times more cash than they have to lend. The loans, credit and interest are all generated by the federal reserve system and though it happens electronically, it is still the largest driver of inflation, dwarfing the amount of cash printed physically by the treasury. 
The graph showing here is money created by the fed out of thin air, diluting every dollar in everyones pockets everywhere and consequentially, driving real estate, the stock market and bitcoin up in dollar value, because the dollar is weakening. in a few years it will take more than a million of them to equal the buying power of one bitcoin, because the fed won't stop making dollars backed by nothing, and bitcoin has a fixed rate of inflation currently 12.5 every ten minutes.

Just remember to pay your taxes on the capital gains and make sure you work within the money transmitter regulations of your state. I don't know how much the student loan was but I know that you're not supposed to receive more than 14k$ from anyone except registered money transmitters. If it is from an individual, like a parent, you have to pay income tax for every dollar over 14k though there is no income tax on inheritance, for large estates there is an estate tax.  Long story short: you cannot receive and transmit large sums of money without registering as a money transmitter even in the case of your own money and your own student loan. You must also pay capital gains tax on any Bitcoin you sell for US dollars. You can deduct interest paid on student loans but there's no tax incentive for paying them off. But take that with a grain of salt I'm not qualified to give financial advice.;)

this one is current and more closely fits the narrative thesis: fed prints money like crazy ergo bitcoin grows like crazy.

Why is it so important to you to pump up segwit? Your posts are all pro segwit in a way that could easily  spread illusions of unanimity around segwit. They at least show that you see someone out there who needs to hear about it. Can you explain why it is important to you? What is it about segwit that causes you to spend all your time posting about it in the absence of any apparent opposition?
