Low fee that's why. If the transaction doesn't clear within two weeks, it will return back to you.

That's a really bad situation, but I wouldn't say all hope is lost. They don't support BCH at the moment, but they'll allow withdrawals on Jan 1, 2018. I'm assuming coinbase did not reply to you yet. Bear in mind that every exchange is swamped with support tickets, so it could be a while until they respond. Don't be very hopeful, but don't completely give up on it. I'd assume it's lost until further notice. You can't do anything else since the private key of the wallet is in their hands.

I suggest sending another message that goes along the lines of this:


Transaction link: ...
Sorry for the inconvenience
Best of luck!

Yes to both questions. Just input your private key and you’ll see your bch balance

Welcome. Unfortunately, it can't be helped. Lightning network or some other solution may save the day, but for now, you're going to have to bear with it. I suggest using altcoins if you're looking to make transactions often to avoid the fees

Ah, apologies for not noticing. Well, I expect some action around 6 hours before it goes live but this is purely speculation.

Welcome. Hope it works out

If you don't mind, could you post what you sent them?

I guess you own 1/140 of a bitcoin

I think he meant: Don't accept the payment if it CAN be reversed. You should check with your bank as he suggested to see if that is the case.
