See how well that worked in Venezuela. The problem is so called progressive tax systems they always devolve into class warfare, the confiscation of the productive classes capital and the eventual destruction of the free market and the society.

I was a millionaire before bitcoin and it is important to reward yourself for foresight and hard work otherwise whats the point? Be good to your self and your family is what having a good life is all about. I suppose your going to take your private keys to the grave.

Your comment is senseless, $300 watch now worth $0 is 100 percent loss. $5000 watch only has to keep up with the time value of money about 2.2 percent a year.

You mean a channel? Check out the ECLAIR website, it is not really clear yet but from what I can tell it should not be to overwhelming but not trivial as you will have to run a hot wallet so better know how to secure your node and channel.

Point to one socialist system that has not collapsed due central planning or the need to start a war to cover their tracks.

I have been successful in recovering information off of hard drives that became un-bootable. It takes some tools and research off the net or you can send me the drive and I can see what I can do for a 10% finders fee. No coins no fee. PM me and we can work something out.

I work in the power industry so I thought about the milgauss also, Rolex Milgauss 116400GV is my favorite but went with the GMT as I have business overseas also so I can see what time it is in Asia at a glance. Not cool to wake people up if you do not have to, besides a Rolex will get you OUT of any country in the world.

Actually it is only a matter of time in all those countries, as the socialists promise more free stuff to buy peoples votes they say they need to increase taxes on "The Rich". However even a basic comprehension of tax policy will show that all the money resides with the middle class as there are simply a lot more of them. This leads to a hollowing out of the middle class and more calls to tax the rich. People quickly lose the incentive to be more productive as why wok harder and longer so someone else can get a free ride? The rich leave as they have the ability to go where they are more welcome and the economy goes into a death spiral with ever more government control and price setting. This destroys actual price discovery so no one knows what it costs to produce or consume anything and the massive miss allocation of resources that eventually results in complete and total economic destruction and actual people starving to death on the streets.  It can take years depending on how dumb the people are and sometimes governments and societies can step back from the precipice of socialist destruction. But show me one successful socialist society that has endured, UK Canada, Australia are not socialist, even though on the face they have progressive tax policies. In reality the rich in all those countries probably pay less than you think they do as they are able to adjust their affairs to minimize their taxes. However in California, Illinois and other progressive states where the favorite sports are taxing "The Rich", confiscating money from corporations through government fiat, you can see the fruits of an effective progressive tax system. The productive people are leaving and the state is destined for bankruptcy due to the socialist payoffs to the government unions.

It is an old saying from the 80's, and been popularized in several films. But I am sure it has been used as a watch worth thousands will generally get immigration or police officials to look the other way for a little while.

Nice watch and pay no attention to the trolls here, as I told one of my peers at work with an apple watch. In 10 years my watch will still be worth thousands and yours will be worthless . I have a red and black GMT master with the jubilee bracelet, the jubilee bracelet is my favorite, good choice enjoy your purchase.

Hmm if you cracked bitcoin would you use it on a wallet that has .0008 BTC I think not. Remember Bill's rule number 54, if you do not have the private key in you hand they are not really your bitcoin.

I run a full Eclair node with a dynamic IP that only changes about one time a month. I just monitor it and when it changes change my eclair.cfg to match. So far my channels seem to reconnect just fine.

The way I read the market is that the trading volume is very small so when there are sell orders of any size it is easy to exhaust the available buy orders resulting in a large fall. When it is falling no one wants to buy until they see the bottom. Same thing on the way up, very few sellers when price accelerates up.

Do your taxes first, I am not giving you tax advice but if you bitcoin mining as a business you can write off some of your losses. That can take some of the sting out if you have other income.

Does it have the same vulnerability as the Nano "S"? Interesting that the BitFi wallet does not have any of these vulnerabilities, no fan of Mcafee but it does seem the most secure as it does not contain the private key.

I have used Samourai wallet for a couple of years and never had a problem. As for a mobile wallet it is the best I have seen in privacy and support.  I agree mobile wallet wallet Samouria and I just downloaded Wasabi last week and am going to try it out this week for coin join. Never seen an article where a noteworthy person cast doubt on Samouria. I would like t read them can you provide links so I can be informed.

Why so angry that is why I sometimes hate to post. I read the response and agree that the ledger is probably secure. However what vulnerabilities have not been found yet? The root of the problem is having your private key on any hardware. I personally have my bitcoin on trevor and ledger and some of my alts on a bitfi so I have bnb used both. Personally I think the future is with the bitfi model as the idea is not to store your private key and if you are going to have btc or lightning channels on your phone for daily use with any significant amount you dont want your private key on that.

Well for the 25% you can either declare it as 100 percent long term capital gains when you liquidate them or use the cost history for the coins you do have a history for to estimate the cost Just document what you do and if they ask tell them the method you used and you should be fine.

I also told a friend that cd's were a transient technology and was laughed at.  I agree trading will be run by computers and AI in the future. You have to ask yourself who profits now and how will that change due to AI to find what to bet on. My vision is that as it exists now a lot of the profit for trading firms comes in the form of front running existing clients orders by computers better connected to the exchanges. This has driven almost all short term traders out of business as the algos strip trading margins by artificially inflating the bid ask execution spread. Now it is a fight between different algorithms and better connections to the exchanges, whoever has the best makes the most money and has hired the best mathematicians in the world to figure it out. This should be similar to what happens when AI takes over, whoever has the best AI will make the most money, whether it is stocks or crypto. It is in the end a zero sum game for them as every bodies AI will get better and better until the differences in performance are about equal just like the high frequency traders today. Day trading by individuals is already dead without some inside knowledge. The only way to profit I see is to invest in the AI companies that are the suppliers of the code?

Here is what I would do, figure out over the time span you have little records for how many bitcoins you mined. Then figure out what the cost to mine those was. This will be your cost basis. Then everything over the cost basis is profit. That way if the IRS or anyone else has a problem you will just be arguing about the method used and not about fraud. My experience is if you make a good faith effort to and have some rational for your accounting the government may say you did it wrong but not try to put you in jail or hit you with fines just interest on what they think you should have paid. I am not a lawyer or an accountant but have had dealings with the IRS and Franchise Tax Board and is from my experience. As long as you are just talking about money your OK, so just be upfront about your situation and stay out of jail or getting fined.
