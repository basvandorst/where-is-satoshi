Yes.  Very much so.  Daddy wants girls to have a life better then he did, so he sells high and buys low.
Nothing personal, just business.

You are supposed to cut your losses and let your winners run.  But if you jumped on too late all you can do is cut losses.  There are not enough winners to let run.
And cutting losses is better than holding bags.

You are in training.  Learn the principles and refine your discipline as you increase your orders of magnitude.  So 100 goes to 500 goes 1,000. Make sure each move is deliberate, all the good advice.
You gotta go long on training.

That was not a hypothesis in the paper.

Please don't reduce the whole academic paper to one sentence and think that you can refute the whole paper with a few sentences.  The Article goes pretty deep into the bitfinex wallet/cold storage activity by volume and time to make its conclusions. They stopped dumps and then started pumps.

I haven't heard of QT exercise any my preliminary searching is getting me a lot of stuff that doesn't seem related to trading or investing.  What does QT stand for and is there a resource you could provide?
Edit: Do you mean quantitative tightening, as opposed to quantitative easing?

Low volume means that a large couple of buys can jack up the price (remember, this could also incude people closing their shorts).  When more people don't enter the market eventually the price falls.  Trading bots can only keep the price moving for so long

Brah I lost 99% crypto investment leverage and I just more than doubled my money this week, so I am only down 95%. If I keep on doing this I will be ahead of the game in like, 8 weeks.
I know BTCUSD needs to consolidate and all that but definately by the end of the year I will be all kinds of rich.
