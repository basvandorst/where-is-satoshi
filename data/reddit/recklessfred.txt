That seems rather blunt for an announcement of a company's dissolution or closing, and way too straightforward and simple a statement to have come from anyone who works at Mt. Gox. My best guess is that this title would played into the potential rebranding indicated in the leaked crisis document- something along the lines of "Mt. Gox is dead. Long live Gox!" or something else equally tired and contrived.

Did you even read it? Also, here's Merriam Webster's take on it, which takes a hard, definitive stance against your "correction."

And how would they do that when they supposedly lost nearly all their BTC and no sane person would ever deposit BTC with Mt. Gox ever again?
