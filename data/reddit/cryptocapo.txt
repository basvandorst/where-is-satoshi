Well said. It clearly represents a threat to the existing power structure.

Great idea! Very cool to see charitable actions such as this. 
I would donate the .1 BTC to newcomers to Bitcoin on Reddit via bitcointips &amp; ALTcointips in order to encourage more participation and education. It would be a terrific motivator for those new to cryptocurrencies.
Also this way all donations could be documented for transparency and honesty!

I grabbed a seat in the theater and followed just out of sheer morbid curiosity.

Yes. You use your public address to receive coins. 
The cheapest site is hard to say as the price fluctuates by the minute. 
Try the ones I listed to start and just compare for the lowest buy-in prices. 
Also, check out - there are many subreddits that will provide useful information

Nice! Do you have to pay extra for the sparks and smoke?

While visiting these sites (or faucets) does provide free BTC it is a very negligible amount. For example, some of the higher paying ones pay out 0.00000055 BTC, while on the lower end 0.00000020 BTC. It would take a very long time and an incredible amount of patience to yield anything worthwhile. Mining is likely out as the computing power to mine even a single Bitcoin is enormous and very costly. 
Your best bet is probably purchasing BTC directly through an exchange (BTC-E or Cryptsy or BTer) You may also consider placing a small portion your money on altcoins and eventually work into Bitcoins.

Too many to list, but I would check out the top 10 coins and do as much research as you can. Also, just like stocks a diversified portfolio will mitigate your risks.
