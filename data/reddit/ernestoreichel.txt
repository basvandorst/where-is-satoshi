You mean no one is going to say here because I'm not paying?
We are in the mid 90's of crypto. No one actually knows what is going to come of it, and I'm only asking what people see it becoming.

As an internet marketer.

The data is *supposed* to correlate
However, local bitcoins steals from us, therefore the numbers don't add up. Don't forget, they got caught in 2015, and admitted to it. This isn't new.

I don't even get 112,200 satoshis of *combined* payments, for an entire week after this transaction. Normally, we get paid within 24 hours for the prior day, at 12:00 UTC.
Furthermore, they did this before, and I called them out. Then, after a bunch of ppl complained and we were talking about a lawsuit, they "fixed" it, temporarily, and we got *exact* payments, as it it supposed to be.

This post alone is far more damaging to their reputation than the few million satoshis they stole.

Oh and by the way, do you not see the title? They stopped stealing after I called them out 2 years ago on Reddit, but then started again.

LBC claims to pay 20% commission on trades. Their commission is 1%, we get 20% of the 1%.  (Multiply by 0.002)
On October 31st, one of my affiliates buys 0.56 BTC.
0.56 x 0.002 = 112,200 satoshis
However, I only got 57 satoshis on November 1st. Nowhere do I recieve my payment.
Keep in mind, this is only for 1 transaction. I have over 5,000 affiliates, and yet didn't even get paid for this transaction, let alone all of the other users who were supposed to get paid for transactions 12 months after they signup.

Only this transaction is $4. It's thousands since 2015, especially when the price was high.
