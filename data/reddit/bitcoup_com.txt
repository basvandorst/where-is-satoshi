already seen it. and different variations of it. just not one showing it going in the opposite direction. I'm thinking of the Space Shuttle Challenger exploding into plumes of bitcoin/the bitcoup logo, but that seems disrespectful.
Or a cartoonish rocket crashed into the moon with the pilot, the still nameless bitcoup logo, slammed onto the moon's surface.
Or a graphical representation of what could happen on the moon. Perhaps the logo staring petrified into a cave full of crab people.
But I like minimalism.

was it White? it hasn't shipped yet, even though you probably got an email saying it had. Thanks for the order!

More products are being added soon, but the cheapest thing is this  . I don't think shirts will ever be cheaper (or at least by that much) here, and the accessories I'm adding can't be priced that low.

this would be a long shirt.

I'd make these shirts cheaper if I could, but I can't right now. I'm going to try to soon. I make 50 cents before taxes if they pay cash, but if BTC is used I can get muffed by volatility. I'm just trying, as a lot of you are, to get the word out there.
I realize that there are tons and tons of bitcoin-related shirts and lots of people selling them. Shopping for them just always felt like such a clusterfuck. I'm not a brand-whore AT ALL, but something needed to, for lack of a better term, unite some of the shirts into an identifiable group.
And many of the sites selling these shirts have gone tits-up. I'm not going anywhere.
Perhaps some of the early, early adopters could afford a 10 BTC shirt. But we are still in the early adoption phase. Every time I rock my Tee, I metaphorically punch people in the chin (while imagining actually doing it).

Made new business relationships yesterday. Everything's now cheaper and payment is much easier. More colors on everything. Shipping is free. The only marketing that has been done is this post, and it brought the site a few hundred visitors and some sales.

Thanks, brother. 
My prices will decrease if I get enough volume to do so. I promise.
You know how loads of Redditors come screaming onto this sub saying "TOLD YOU SO!" when their crystal ball revealed where the price was headed? I'm just now putting up a shirt mocking this. It's extremely clever. Drum roll, please.... it says "TOLD YOU SO." Took loads of brainpower...or just time spent on Reddit.
I'm gonna cool down with the selection, though. I hate logging onto a site just created and seeing a trillion shirts.
