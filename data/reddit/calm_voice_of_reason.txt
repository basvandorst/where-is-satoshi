jesus christ. Why is it that people believe this is neccessary? Have you even been to localbitcoins.com? You transfer to a bank account. Meeting in person only some dudes allow. Check out things a bit before you judge them...

So if a company is wildly volatile in it's birth but i believe in the technology they produce, it doesn't make good business sense to hold their shares?
Companies like overstock and tiger direct can afford to hold their bitcoins. Smaller businesses make so little of their percentage in bitcoin sales so they might also be able to hold. I can't understand why people would downvote something which if you are a believer in bitcoin, would be good for the whole of bitcoins ecosystem.

I'm sorry but you do not appear to understand localbitcoins.com. It is not necessary to meet with a dude. In most cases you transfer money to his bankaccount and he transfers bitcoins to you. If he should be dishonest he gets a negative rating and others avoid him... On the whole much safer than thousands of people depositing their bitcoins to one man, that has the option to transfer all those funds to his private account whenever he wishes. Which is what goes on at an exchange and online wallet.

It's not good, and if we need to add more money to fraudsters and hackers pockets of the overall bitcoin balance sheet in order to "separate the professionals from the fly-by-night operations" then that's a major liability of the bitcoin system. People need to get educated to not use exchanges and online wallets; in the whole get out of the bank-mentality they are so used to, if not bitcoin will never be taken seriously by the masses, because it will never reach a stable price... Stop comparing bitcoin to the internet at it's infancy too and DON'T use exchanges and online wallets...
Also, bitcoin for POS need to be fixed. Or it will forever be a "internet-currency"(unless that also fails because of the aforementioned). You can't wait 10 minutes to buy a burger. ALSO the reference client is unstable because it's based on fucking QT which is shit(atleast on windows). I can't believe all the circle-jerking and evangelist nonsense which goes on in this reddit. Of course some of it is because of lack of knowledge but if we want bitcoin to succeed we have to stop being apologists for bitcoins weak points...
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:43:48
why do you say they are too smart to touch any? do you not believe in bitcoin? Do you not believe the price will rise again?
The way i see it is merchants basically have 2 options:
1) convert to fiat immediately
2) hold some amount or all bitcoins because they either believe it will rise and/or because they understand and want to promote the bitcoin idea.

Why isn't pools implementing p2pool then? Are any of the big ones doing it? Aren't they essentially saying i am evil by not doing it or is it some other reasons they can have to not want to implement p2pool?
Also couldn't the bitcoin foundation just release a new version of the bitcoin software that refuses to send transactions to pools that doesn't use p2pool(or something like this...)?
With time the pools **will** have to adjust. Is there a problem here?
@_date: 2014-03-19 05:11:30
Maybe i am. I don't use them :P But aren't they usually the same? You buy btc through them and you can send btc from them... Seems the same to me. That's atleast how justcoin operates which is the only exchange iv'e used...
edit: i added a note about online wallets. you are right that they are somewhat different even though both have the same dangers.

Not very probable.

A fundamental problem is that it is written in QT which is shit on windows... The official client crashed on me too the first time i tried it. C++ and Qt is not a stable combination.
They should really just rewrite the whole thing in C. Having such a shitty mainclient isn't good for bitcoins perception, perhaps also a big reason people use webclients... However: theDewwd. Why do you only want to use the "official" client? Electrum and Multibit should work better than the "official" client.
edit: confused waxwing for theDewwd.

Keeping a few millitbits are not the problem. The problem is that people keep a lot more there. That is why i thought it a good idea to come together as a community and recommend offline wallets &amp; local wallets instead of a website where the operator can run away with the money at any time he feels like it. It literally is that easy.

oops sorry, meant theDewwd. I suppose he thinks the main client is "safer" which i suppose it in theory should be. Which is why the bitcoin foundation guys really need to get their shit in order. Even a perception problem is a big problem for bitcoin.

You are right that Satoshi "shut him out", however he also quit the project because Gavin visited the CIA... Now Gavin just seems like a run-of-the-mill kinda guy, a person incapable of having a higher purpose than food on the table in whatever way that doesnt inconvenience him. I don't know him, so ofc i could be wrong, just saying what it looks like. However, what are you talking about "truth about Gox". Or are you just a drama-queen?

1) Hmm. Are you sure it's not just the founder who has some bitcoins and not something built into the system?
*I'm not sure you explained the principle there.
2) I'm not sure even smaller businesses would "risk their business' profit" if they held a percentage. Bitcoin is still rather small and most merchants have most of their percentage of sales in fiat so i don't think that's a huge problem. Accounting will hopefully be easier in the future with new software functionality to deal with that. Also, do remember that the world isn't just the US.
However, perhaps im a bit more idealistic than you and believe merchants actually care about the world and wants to better it.
@_date: 2014-04-04 02:47:26
You should keep the money in bitcoin instead of immediately exchanging it for dollars. This is because whenever merchants immediately exchange the bitcoins for dollars/euros/etc it creates sell-pressure and may bring the bitcoin price down. Also, whoever researches bitcoin believes that bitcoin will rise rise rise, so it would just be good business sense to hold them... Idk if bitpay et al allow only a percentage to be converted to fiat but they really should for those people who'd like to hedge their bets.

They don't always need to invade. Sometimes it's enough to replace the democratically elected president with one that is favorable to local interests(most of the time it's big business). They tried to do just that in Venezuela. If you are interested you can checkout a very good documentary about this: The Revolution Will Not Be Televised - Chavez: Inside the Coup.
Not that this is unique. CIA have an entire toolbox of things they try before they send official troops/invades. If you are interested you can checkout: Killing Hope: U.S. Military and C.I.A. Interventions since World War II.

Don't downvote me immediately, but wouldnt Amazon accepting bitcoin bring down the price of bitcoin if they are converted to fiat immediately if they use a service like bitpay?
Because if there are lots of sellers and not so many buyers the price goes down? Isn't that how pricesetting work?
So if im right, amazon accepting bitcoin might completely devalue bitcoin, which can't be a good thing :|
However if amazon is smart they could make a lot of money while at the same time helping the currency. If they hold their bitcoin, or atleast a sizable percentage, the price of bitcoin would go up as more people find out about bitcoin and/or decide to buy some bitcoin because amazon is using it. Amazon is big enough to move the market by themselves, thus generating more profit for themselves :O
If this is true, Amazon implementing bitcoin could be a really really great business idea for themselves as well as helping everyone else in the bitcoin ecosystem while pioneering a more conscientious currency than the corrupt traditional big-banking system we have today... Which could again help them and their image through the network effect...

I never said that "hip new thing syndrome" applies to php. My whole point was that it applied to those other new languages people use instead of php.
A lot of valid actors use PHP. We don't really need fb to make an example now do we, and fb could easily have been rewritten with a dozen or so of the thousands of engineers fb employs. Instead they chose to improve php itself with HIP or whatever they call their virtual machine(HIP, heh.. ironic :P).
My point is that PHP is tried and true. And maybe im just a noob at coding but i don't get what so spectacularly bad with it. I get that other languages are prettier and perhaps faster to code in, but most of my life as a nerd has been spent using applications and it's nothing i hate more than ducttape apps that feel like mud and are more unstable than   an earthquake. I don't think PHP makes that kinda apps, but im not so sure about django et al and maybe ruby on rails. In the last instance we have to remember we code for our users, not ourselves(if that is indeed the case ofc..).
@_date: 2014-04-05 12:55:49
I'm not sure what you mean by "the same way" unless you want to build a ebay clone and have it automagically be as big as ebay... I'm sorry for the snarkiness but you kinda had it coming :P
Im not familiar with if ebay allows it, but youd only need to download a bitcoin client like multibit or electrum and post a unique address for each item on ebay to track if the user has paid. If you want to get more complex you could go through one of the merchant payment companies like bitpay et al. Not sure if you want to setup your own webpage or not. If you wanted to go even more complex you could hire a programmer to setup bitcoin payment and he should be able to do it in a week(you can hire me :P))
edit: also, youd have the option of holding bitcoins or just selling them off for fiat automatically. I guess which option you choose depends on whether or not you believe in bitcoin going to rise and believes in the idea. Also, merchants creating sell side pressure can bring down the price.

Why does one thing preclude the other? Also, how many people here do you think would be able to meaningfully contribute to the codebase of bitcoin?
The price of bitcoin is slowly declining right now.. In order to combat that problem we need two things 1) more publicity for bitcoin. Bitcoin has to be seen as cool, not as nerdy.. stuff like NASCAR would help in this direction(all extreme sports would...) 2) Improve the product. Unfortunately very few are able to do this.
Perhaps you are the idiot.

Proving funds is better than not proving funds. However it doesn't offer much in securing users funds. Developing with bitcoind i know that if they want to run away with the users funds they only need to execute one command from cmd-line to do it. People on this subreddit doesn't seem to get this. Proving funds isn't magically going to secure ANY exchange.
TL;DR: Don't trust any exchange. If you have to use one because you make money on arbitrage and can't use localbitcoins.com, get your money out as fast as you can and don't let it sit for any period of time.

I don't trust any exchange or online wallet to hold my funds. Neither should any of you. The only reason you use it is because you're so used to the idea of a Bank that you can't wrap your head around not needing one anymore. Use localbitcoins.com and offline storage and a local wallet for spend money. I tried to get a post up on this reddit that proposed to add a note to the right-side info bar a recommendation-notice to not use exchanges and online wallets or at least explain the dangers and close-down statistics, but was voted down. A bit strange considering it looks like about 50% or more of all current exchanges or wallets have been "hacked" or outright stolen the users funds and if more get "hacked" we'll look even more ridiculous in Joe doe's eyes and the price will go further down.
@_date: 2014-03-23 17:22:32
I don't see how that is different from how i said. I didn't set a specific timelimit of which usage of exchanges would be 'safe'. You're just proving my point: Don't use exchanges. Don't use online wallets.
As a programmer having used bitcoind i know that all the users funds are 1 command(literally 1 command...) away from being transferred to some account. When you can become a millionaire that easily i don't think we should trust any exchange or online wallet. Then it is the issue of hacking. Everyone lauds bitchain.info but if you look in this very subreddit they have had some serious security issues in the past(and from the looks of it they didn't seem very eager to fix those very issues...). The way I see it is people need to be educated and need a nod to get out of the 'Bank-mentality' if we want bitcoin price to start rising again.
@_date: 2014-06-11 22:31:31

His idea isn't that bad only yours is better: just send directly to the pools. The problem is that not many people know how to do that.. that's why such a reward/incentive mechanism built in to the client(s) or even better protocol would really be the best solution. We have to remember that not everyone is so technically inclined to even bother learning about mining, pools etc etc.
However if you solve that problem you have to figure out how big the fee should be etc etc. An idea is to set apart a fee to other pools/miners depending on how big percentagewise a pool is, so that it would actually be more profitable to be small(er) because you get more percentage of the transfer fees.
Maybe some clever(or not, i'm not a math buff) math could be utilized so that the proportions of poolsize would stay economically most viable relative to other pools. Well it's an idea. Now to go eat chocolate and watch tv :P

I keep hearing this. However my experience with new technologies is like this: A new language/toolkit comes out that is supposed to be so much better than the last one and every programmer and their mother flocks to it because it's the hip thing. Then they start using it and realize google/stackexchange doesn't have half the code examples they need, they hit a bug or corner-case that has long since been dealt with in the old technology and best-practice &amp; security guides are nonexistant. Or it's simply too inefficient for their purposes.
Never fails. 
All the big-guns like facebook, google etc are using PHP. If it's good enough for them it's good enough for you. It doesn't have to be perfect or sexy, and it's idiosyncrasies you **deal** with. If Linus listened to all the requests over the years from programmers to switch to C++ because "why are you using that **old** language, are you crazy??" linux would be a blip on the radar and so bloated as to be unusable...
