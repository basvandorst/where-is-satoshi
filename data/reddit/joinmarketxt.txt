As a matter of fact, they offered me a choice of several sandwiches when I went to the counter. I guess I have to keep my identity a better secret?

I had looked last night, and it must have been after the shop had closed because there was a notice saying that the online shop was temporarily inactive so I assumed it would still be inactive. Thank you for clearing this up.

**tl;dr: Cool place, good food, and most importantly - nice staff! But the tech is still a little clunky.**
full story:
I happened to be visiting family in Bern this week, and after seeing this post last night, decided to buy my dad lunch there. Unfortunately none of the lightning apps for Android support the old potato which I use as a pocket computer, so I had to get creative: I sent photographs of the QR codes to a friend at home, who made the LN payments, and then he sent me an address to which I refunded him via a regular transaction. In further misfortune, a construction team was busy tearing up the pavement right in front of the screen in that photo, but they let me past their barricade to scan the codes. We stood outside while I performed this overly complicated procedure, attracting the attention of both the construction team tearing up the pavement and the manager who came out to check what the difficulty was; once my friend made the payments, I reimbursed him and we ate and chatted a bit with the manager.
Some thoughts, for u/guggero_lightning:
The system works excellently for single orders, but it's less convenient for ordering multiple items (the POS takes a minute to update after each order, and each payment invalidates the previous codes). Ordering sandwiches and smoothies for two people through the screen took way longer than it would've had I ordered them from the counter; granted, it'd be quicker with a wallet on my own phone, but it's still not the most convenient system; a better one would allow selection of multiple items before presenting a payment request QR. I'm imagining the following UX:
* The default display is similar to the current one: a few "instant" options, with payment request QRs that upon payment display the customer's order code for just that one item.
* In addition, the default screen includes one QR code which is a simple URL. A request to this URL causes the screen to display several order options, each with its own URL in a QR code.
* Requesting any one of these URLs adds that item to the current order. Once 
 at least one item has been added to the order, a payment request QR appears, and is updated with each order to reflect the total price.
* Once payment is made (or if no payment is made within some timeout) the screen reverts to the default display.

There are currently three Android apps:
1. As you mentioned - [Eclair](
2. The brilliantly-named [Lightning Wallet](
3. For more technically inclined folks - specifically, those who have their own LN node (or at least, one which they trust): [Spark](

They actually have quite a detailed printout presented with each order, and it includes VAT/MWST information if you need it.

Thank you for your reply.
Specifically regarding mobile apps: judging by the current [Android version distribution]( this is only a problem for the "bottom 3%" who are still using old phones... the easiest solution would be for me to just get a new, or at least, less-old phone, but I do hope that app developers will keep backwards-compatibility in mind.

I had a bit of trouble with reflections off the glass, but once those were shaded away, even my potato camera instantly resolved the QR. The system is actually quite convenient.

How many DNA base pairs of KYC does that thing take?
My favorite ATMs are the cash-only Lamassu OGs, but they still snap your face through the QR glass and lift the prints off your cash.

My usual pet theory (beyond the usual "Chinese fake volume" party line) is that people are trying to reverse-engineer the [XBX]( weighing algorithm, but it looks like in this case, all exchanges rallied together.

Another question for you:
Do you have any questions for yourself?

In theory, you're correct.
In practice, there has been no evidence yet of the IRC server interfering with peer discovery. Since absence of evidence is not evidence of absence, development efforts to improve decentralization proceed along three avenues:
* [Counterparty discovery across multiple IRC servers](
This is an interim solution, but much simpler to implement than
* [Moving away from IRC as a messaging channel]( to remove the dependence on centralized discovery points; and
* [Improving the liquidity selection algorithm]( to diversify counterparty selection in a manner more expensive to "game".
Sybil attacks are impossible to completely prevent (without introducing identity, which runs counter to the entire point of this project), and the system should simply make them as expensive as possible relative to honest participation.

Thank you for the shoutout.
In addition to donating, consider adding liquidity to the market; think of it as compensation for running a node.

They'd rapidly lose business due to false positives and negative stigma.

1. Coinbase lose business over this. They get terrible publicity on this sub from people who get banned, and anybody who uses them does so only as an exchange, withdraws the coins, and sends them to themselves enough times to form a false negative in their braindead systems.
1. Fungibility is important to Bitcoin's role as financial technology. People who understand finance know this and won't hurt fungibility. Maybe Coinbase is run by a bunch of idiots? OK, not a bunch, but maybe one? The most charitable thing I can say about them, if you insist that their harmful practices are forced by their government, is that they are incorporated in some weird blend of Nazi Germany and Soviet Russia.
1. Bitcoin *is* fungible at the protocol level. Anybody who tries to make it not so, is adding additional layers. Note that Coinbase will happily *receive* coins from anywhere, and then simply freeze your account because they like your money more than they like you. That doesn't mean Bitcoin failed.

Shouldn't the "*Relative* BTC Price" column be in BTC, not dollars?
ninja edit: OK, I see what you mean - "Price of one BTC, if it reaches this market cap" - but maybe "This market cap measured in today's bitcoin" could also be interesting.

Plenty of money being made (and lost) arbitraging the correlation between ETH and ETC. Even if as many people are "using" ETC as are using any other useless alt, the token still has some value due to speculation relative to other markets.

The chart showing network value post-split according to Metcalfe's Law is overly simplistic: it's assuming that there's no overlap. [Some exchanges will support both chains]( and any users market making between the two chains should be counted as using both networks. Arguably the only users who should be counted as not using one fork or the other are those who don't even sell their coins on that fork, but quantifying the level of a user's involvement in a network is beyond the scope of this comment.
I've extended the chart to cover three kinds of overlap between the two networks. Each one tells you by how much to increase either A, B, or both. All values are given in percentages of the original network's users or value.
       Fork A          Fork B    Separate       Overlap
    Users  Value    Users  Value   Value    +A   +B   +both
     100    100        0      0     100      0    0       0
      90     81       10      1      82      9   33       8
      80     64       20      4      68     17   40      14
      70     49       30      9      58     25   41      17
      60     36       40     16      52     31   40      20
      50     25       50     25      50     36   36      20
The bottom half is left out, as the chart is symmetric (swap A and B and reflect across the middle row).
Here are some examples of how to interpret the chart:
* If 2% of the original network's users leave it for a fork, but at least 16% use both networks, then the total value of both forks can be expected to exceed the total value of the original network. This is from the "+both" column of the second row.
* If 20% of the original network's users stop using it, and fewer than 40% use both networks, then the total value can be expected to be less than the original value. This is from the +B column of the third row.
* Assuming no more than 30% of users are willing to use the new network in any way shape or form, any abandonment of the original network beyond 5% will lead to a decrease in the total value. This is from the +A column of the fourth row.
**Again, *this is ridiculously oversimplified*. I'm providing it mainly to show how even if you ascribe some validity to this kind of calculation, it can still suggest an increase in total value after the fork.**

They both produce Coinjoin transactions, although JoinMarket does this in a decentralized manner coordinated by the sender, whereas BC.i does it in a centralized manner under their control.
