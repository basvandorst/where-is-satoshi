In all honesty, because people have too much fiat tied up against BTC. For some people, their BTC holdings are literally their life savings. And they firmly believe that the price will rise at least 10x more - so they'll be worth 10x more if people just stick with BTC. 
That's what I'm getting out of the situation, and what I've been seeing since the $2k mark. People simply got too greedy, and are counting on BTC to be their golden ticket.

Let's use foreign exchange for the example: 
Currency ABC / XYZ trades at 8.000. That means to buy one ABC, you need to pay 8.000 XYZ. 
Let's say you buy 10 ABC, for 80.000 XYZ. 
Next morning, the rate has gone up to 8.050. You decide to sell all your ABC's, and sell them for 80.5 XYZ. You just made 0.5 XYZ. 
But at this rate, the changes need to be HUGE, or you need a ton of XYZ to make money. You're not rich, but your broker offers a service: You can just loan money from them, and then profit much more on the small changes. 
You loan 100:1, meaning that for every ONE XYZ you own, you trade with HUNDRED XYZ instead. 
Using the hundred-to-one leverage, you could have bought 8000 XYZ worth of ABC's, so 1000 ABC. With the rate going up by 0.050, you can now sell your 1000 ABC for 8050 XYZ. 
But there's one catch...what if the rate had dropped? You're trading with hundred times your worth (the money you have on their trading account). Surely 80 XYZ won't cover much, when a small change from 8.000 to 8.050 made a 50 XYZ difference. That's like 60%-70% of your deposit. 
Well, let's say it had gone down from 8.000 to 7.900. What would happen then? That's a 100 XYZ difference (using 100:1 leverage), 20 XYZ more than you have on your account. 
What happens, is that your broker calls you, and orders you to deposit more money on your account, to cover the losses. If not, they'll close your account, and take all your money. This is what's called margin call. You need a safety margin between what you actually have on your account, and what the amplified (due to leveraging) changes amount to. 
Obviously, with a high leverage, small changes will amount to much, much more. Imagine playing with thousand times leverage...for every buck you own, you can trade for thousand. Hundred bucks gives you the buying power of one HUNDRED thousand bucks. 
Stock brokers etc. also offer leveraging. But usually not as big as in foreign exchange. But the principle still stands: You trade with money you don't have - and if you can't cover your losses, your account gets closed and they take your money. Often automatically. 
Small changes get amplified by whatever leveraging you're using. 
Imagine that you're leveraged to your neck, and then some sudden flash-crash anomaly comes? Your account is gonna get wiped out on seconds, automatically, unless you have some automatic sell level (stop-loss) that gets triggered. 
That's the leveraging part. 
These guys are also betting on things going up or down, with other people. 
So when you see 2x,5x, or whatever, they're betting that multiplier of their own money. 
If they bet 5 million x5, they're essentially betting 25 million on swings. They also need lots of money to cover potential losses, but can win a whole lot on it.

How many people would afford to buy 10 bitcoins today? That's almost $120k, liquid. I guess under 20%, maybe less. And those savings are probably tied up in illiquid assets.
If the avg. American spent all his/her savings and bought 0.1 BTC today, for a whooping $1150, and BTC rose up to $100k, they'd make roughly $8850, before capital gains taxes. A nice investment, for sure, but what's the chance of half the US population betting all their savings on BTC, and the holding onto it until it reaches $100k.

As with everything in the financial world, things are measured in probability. If there was *any* legit threat of the US and USD folding, the majority of financial people would move their assets, or sell them of a safe currency. 
There's a higher probability of the US gov. banning or putting heavy regulations on cryptocurrencies, than the US gov. folding - or the USD inflating to the moon.

So I went through the financial statement of Visa, and in their operating expenses, the post "Network and Processing" is listed as $620 million. I'm assuming power consumption is baked into that post, among other things.  
If mining BTC pulled 30 TWh this year, that would be quite expensive. 
But anyway, EVEN though all these banking and CC companies have huge warehouses and data centers, they're likely not doing heavy power-consuming calculations. Comparing a data center of credit card processing machines and infrastructure, to a mining farm would be quite different. The latter is working 100% 24/7/365, while the first is doing light operations 24/7/365. 
edit: And before anyone starts bringing up all banks and financial institutions: Banks do not only deal with consumer credit or such transactions. There ares so, so many different areas in banking, many which are completely irrelevant for cryptocurrencies.

Uh-huh 
How will they deal with scammers? Right now, it's possible only because paypal is so integrated in the system, that they can hold your money for x days. 
So for this to work, someone would need to hold your BTC for x days = Huge fucking investment. 
If I'm a seller, and get paid x BTC on 01.XX, and have to wait until 22.XX to get my BTC available, then that could have a dramatic effect on pricing. 
BTC could have gone up $5K or down $5K in that timespan. And Ebay will sure as hell not shell out the difference. 
@_date: 2017-12-12 23:18:52
With the current volatility, it would be a nightmare for sellers. 
Say you accept 0.01 BTC for some item, but Ebay has put a 21-day hold on that. On day 01.01 that 0.01 BTC is worth say $150. The 21 days later, it's worth $80. Or $210. Who knows. 
Sellers would be scared to lose money, buyers would be scared to overpay - even though both parts could make money or get a bargain. 
(Yes, I know those holds are placed on new or casual sellers).

Most big banks, and especially not Investment Banks, don't make money on regular people. 
In fact, regular commercial banking, should be viewed as a insurance if anything. 
If you have $50k in your savings account, they're insured by the gov. 
Sure, they'll lose the value over time, but you don't need to worry about the money vanishing. 
If you own cryptos, it's your own responsibility. Kinda like stashing away money at home...if someone breaks into your house, or the house goes up flames, the money is lost. 
Commercial banks can rather be compared to crypto exchanges. So be sure to have one that's insured.

If you don't show BTC 100% unconditional support, you're labeled a shill and spreading FUD. 
Any criticism, or even discussion, will be met with a random video (or Andreas talk), which may or may not address your issue directly, or even contain conclusive answers. 
My only conclusion is that people here are too vested in BTC, and will do everything in their power to prevent news or information that could make BTC prices go down. Legit or not. 
If you can't discuss legit concerns like block size or upgrades without deleting / banning / brigading, then I'm gonna go ahead and assume you're corrupt and have something to hide.

Could be poor infrastructure too. 
Their private keyes could have been compromised YEARS ago, and whoever stole the money, has simply been dormant or monitoring the wallet ever since. 
Lets say you started trading bitcoins a couple of years ago. Then you come up with this idea that NiceHash has. You decide to just use your own wallet...and a couple of years go by, and you forget to transfer it all. Your PK's could have been compromised waay back then, by something as simple as malware. 
Or it's some kind of inside job. Either way: Fraud of incompetence, doesn't look good any way you slice it.

BTC has been relatively stable for 4 days now. No upward or downward trend, though higher volatility than before.  
Now it's centered around $17k, and swinging up / down with $1k. 
The last time we had this stability, was around Nov 20 - 25. 
Before that, a week in mid October, and before that, week in mid September.

If you're 40-80 years old, not too tech-savvy, know fuck-all about cryptos, and have more money than time, it's easier to just pay pocket change to some guy to do it for you. 
I think few of the wealthy people are very active on their investments. At most, they probably get their weekly / monthly / yearly updates from their financial manager, or look at their investments dashboard / account from time to time. 
Almost 20% ROI would be fantastic(in my imagined example). That's the rates you get when buying into a highly successful hedge-fund, or very risky investments.

Unfortunately, I think that greed would trump this one. Even if exchanges blocked it, the thief could find private buyers and sell at a much very low rate...remember, no mater what you steal, there are substantial losses in the laundering process of goods. Keeping track of every wallet that interacts with the hot one would be a challenge, as the BTC starts to propagate outwards. And at some points, it's gonna get mixed.

A lot of these guys are young libertarians and anarcho-capitalists that foresee a near future where bitcoins rule everything, and somehow came to a conclusion that taxes are / will be a thing of the past.

But on the flip side, saying that you did the research without putting out any public research, well, who are they to know if it's true or not? 
There are tons of people that got lucky, and later attributed that luck to "instinct","gut feeling","knowledge"/"smarts". 
No doubt some in the crypto community did solid reading, and probably had some other knowledge / interests which crossed paths with cryptocurrencies, but there are also those that bought a couple when they were cheap, and now brand themselves as genius investors, visionaries, and what not - even though it was nothing else than pure, dumb luck. 
The armchair economists have been coming out of the woodwork since summer, all denouncing fiat currency because they got lucky. That's what separates the chaf from the wheat: The ones that have been vocal, advocating the tech for years, and have written / published tons of information, are more credible than the recent fly-by-night BTC evangelists 
Building a reputation takes time, and in a community like this, it's a given that you should contribute. 
That's why a lot of people have problems with the recent "experts" that were nowhere to be seen prior to Summer, but claim to have done extensive work / research the past years.

I suspect the biggest threat is banks closing accounts related to cryptocurrencies. 
A bank and state co-ordinated attack would probably be something like this: 
- Gov. bans cryptocurrencies, and hand out hefty fines or punishments. Maybe on the grounds of money-laundering, tax evasion schemes, anti-destabilization, or something like that. 
 
- Banks put in clauses that you can't use their accounts or services to buy or sell cryptos. 
One will work as a deterrent to deal in cryptos, other will make it a pain in the ass, or remove incentives (i.e earning fiat via cryptos).

Yes, that happened here in Norway as well. For some years banks would advise people to take out their mortgage in Swiss Franc. Lots of people were maxed out on mortgage (i.e 85% of purchase price was debt), and then the Franc went up 40%, essentially making their loans 40% more expensive. 
So if you had a 1 million mortgage, it was suddenly 1.4 million, almost over night. That's a substantial rise when it comes to monthly payments, and many sold with losses, still owing their banks way more money. 
Now, we have luckily seen lawsuits after that, where the consumers sued banks (and their financial advisors), on the basis that they had been misled. Apparently, some of the advisors had assured them that FX-backed loans were "low-risk". FX is inherently volatile, even though many currencies are less volatile than others...Swiss Franc was one of these. Until it wasn't.

All of traditional banking does not go towards consumer credit or processing. Only a tiny bit. Most of regular banking does completely other things.

Let's say you operate some small fund, and have 10 million USD to spend. You buy in at $16k (625 coins), and gamble the price will rise to $20k. You sell at $20k, which equals to $12500000. You just made $2.5 million dollars before capital gains taxes. 
If you're just some fund manager (in this case, you're the person that's buying and holding) that convinced 10 technically clueless (but rich) people to all chip in $1 million each, and then collect a 20% fee on all earnings...that's a $500k payday, before taxes. 
You didn't even need to spend your own money.
Totally plausible in a extreme bull-run like this.

Yes, hes' correct. 
You can divide bitcoin (or cryptos in general) into these phases 
Inception and very early beginning = Purely a novelty application. People started to see the applications, and use the services to buy basic stuff online, or sending to each other Ca. 2009 to mid 2013
Beginning = Prices start to take off. This is where speculative people with disposable cash start to buy up, just in case. At this point, where BTC went from $25 to $1000, they started to get at the point where for example unemployed contributors couldn't afford. 
If you're living on welfare, or couch surfing, putting in $1000 can be next to impossible. In todays money, those $1000 would be worth hundreds of thousands. 
Post-beginning cool-down = After the first crash, when the prices were hovering around $250 - $750 for a couple of years. ca. Mid 2014 to Early 2017. 
On the innovation adaption curve, I think we've just passed the early adopters, early in the early majority phase. 
Either way: The point still stands. If you didn't have enough money back then, you couldn't buy. Simple as that.
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:44:55
It took 1455 days to go from $1000 to $10000. It took 9 days to go from $10000 to $12000. 
So that might not be unrealistic, but there's no pattern in these recent $1k increments 
(In case you want them
BTC / USD     Date 
$1000	11.28.2013 
$2000 	05.20.2017
$3000	08.05.2017
$4000	08.13.2017
$5000	10.12.2017
$6000	10.21.2017
$7000	11.02.2017
$8000	11.19.2017
$9000	11.26.2017
$10000	11.28.2017
$11000	12.02.2017
$12000	12.06.2017
Days from first time hitting left figure, to first time hitting right figure, i.e $1000 increments. 
$1k -&gt; $2K = 1269 days 
$2k -&gt; $3k = 77 days 
$3k -&gt; $4k = 8 days 
$4k -&gt; $5k = 60 days 
$5k -&gt; $6k = 9 days 
$6k -&gt; $7k = 12 days 
$7k -&gt; $8k = 11 days 
$8k -&gt; $9k = 7 days 
$9k -&gt; $10k= 2 days 
$10k-&gt; $11k= 5 days

Some problems I have with this video and explanation
1. He compares BTC production to all banking. All banking is not related to what you and I, as consumer do. Banking is incredibly diverse, and whole lot of it has little to do with financial transactions from consumers.  
You can't say "Look at the big sky scraper" on wall street, and lump those costs into the price of transferring money. They're doing completely different things. 
Also, he doesn't really back any of his assumptions with numbers. Saying "Do you think those server / processing farms are better?", well, yes, it's like comparing apples to oranges. A miner could be compared to a supercomputer, doing difficult calculations 24/7.
If you want to check out how much banks and credit card companies use, you can check out their financial reports and look up expenses. Then you compare those to the current energy spent on BTC mining. 
Energy is also stored and sold/traded.

Let's say you have some financial expert. A man that has spent 40-50 years of his life looking at charts, charts of all kinds of assets...stocks, currencies, commodities, you name it - he's seen 'em all. He's spent tens to hundred of thousands of hours looking at charts, doing analysis, going through numbers. He has no interest in the asset, as he makes all the money trading them between each other. He couldn't really care less if it's USD, EUR, or BTC - he makes all the money on his trades. 
Even though he might be new on the tech, he still has merit from his experience with looking at the graphs and numbers. 
There's unfortunately too many 20-somethings here that feel like experts, since they've read a couple of blogs, or maybe even a book, on the subject, and then scoff at these professionals for not understanding it like they do.

Yes, it's a real and life-threatening issue for bitcoin. 
Simply put: If bitcoin becomes too expensive an impractical to handle, someone else will takes it place, even though the fixes are underway or in planning. 
Saying "Yeah, but 5 years from now everything will work smoothly" is worthless. Failure to expand is a real issue businesses face. 
Imagine if the first iphone Apple released had been a real piece of shit (though very popular due to brad name alone), and then said "yeah our first Iphone is next to useless, but just wait a couple of years and we'll have it sorted out!".

My take is that big money is being poured in, probably by larger investors - both people and funds. 
These are the different scenarios: 
- Whales and institutions are buying in 
- Regular people and small-time investors are going all in, instead of a small amount 
- Gigantic amount of new buyers joining the market, but with normal sums 
I think it's more a combination of the first and second. Mostly the first. If everyone and their mother started to buy BTC overnight, I think we'd see that on the unconfirmed transactions.  Millions of new and small transactions would clog the exchanges. 
So my wild guess is that the majority of purchases comes from whales and institutionalized buyers, and the remaining from established hobbyists going more in, and of course a good number of new buyers.

The reason rich and wealthy people pay less in taxes, is because relative to their fortune, it's not expensive to follow the rules and set up a system like that. Tax lawyers don't charge a percentage of your fortune, they take a flat fee. 
If all your income comes from a $50k salary, paying some lawyer $10k won't save you much, if anything at all. When all is said and done, you'd probably lose money. 
If your income comes from a $500k salary, and $10MM portfolio, paying some lawyer to minimize your taxes does make sense. He'll take a flat fee, which is much, much smaller than what you're taking home. ¨
You could probably do all the work yourself, but that one require quite a deep and specialized knowledge, and network of people.

Short-term capital gains would but him around 33%-35%, so that's around $140k (CG taxes off profit minus initial investment, i.e 450k - 45k = 405k  *0,33). And 15% if long-term.

But banks can close accounts tied to crytpos. 
If that happens before widespread adaption (i.e people actually buying and selling stuff), who in their right mind would accept BTC? If all their bills have to be paid in fiat. 
I mean, the real world of business operates on cash-flow. Most businesses can't just take BTC, and hold onto it for years, until their suppliers / lenders / etc. start accepting. 
Point is: If banks really want to destroy crytpos, they need to start soon. Before regular people start buying / selling stuff. Sure, you and me can still use it between us, and our peers, but if those selling the real valuable items won't accept, and banks won't allow usage, then that's a huge problem. 
And who knows, maybe the governments start rounding up early traders, forcing them to pay back-taxes on earlier profits.

- Roll out heavy handed regulations, effectively banning all cryptos that offer 100% anonymity. Probably under the pretense of money laundering, theft, drug money, terrorist funding, or something similar. 
- Close or force gigantic fines on every exchange that does not comply. Put unreasonably big demands on them, in terms of customer verification. Make banks report every account that is associated with crypto trading. Threaten banks with huge fines if they're active with these accounts. 
- Maybe threaten with retroactive taxes on profits, going back N years. Would probably fuck over a huge amount of people now, but also future tax evaders. (Just look at all those broke athletes that forget to report income from sponsors etc., and then get fucked over 5-10 years later) 
- Force ISPs to report user activity related to crytpocoins
Essentially, force it to become a underground activity. You can't ban it completely, but you can make it hard enough that regular people won't bother.

I think that in order to buy a lambo, you should have at least 50 BTC. A 2017 Aventador would cost half of that. Blowing half your savings on a lambo wouldn't be the best thing to do, as you probably have more valuable things to buy before that (like a house in a nice neighborhood, which will almost guaranteed appreciate over the years). 
So...I wouldn't buy a lambo unless I had around 100 BTC, and didn't own any real-estate.

I guess technically one could, by selling at the local highs, and buying at local lows. 
Say you bought 60 coins for $300 in 2012. Then you sold them for $60k in 2014, when BTC were selling for $1k. A couple of months later spent the $60k on 240 coins ($250 a piece), which would be worth almost $3 million today. 
But timing the market like that is a crap shoot. Most people would have been ecstatic on turning $300 into $60000, and would most likely pay down big things with those (house, car, student loans, credit card, etc.). 
I have a feeling that some of the few bitcoin multi-millionaires we have today, are those that had substantial amounts of money laying around when prices started going up. I mean, how many of the current millionaires were just lucky dudes that bought coins around $1, and managed to hold onto them for 7 years?

If you assume Satoshi won't or can't use his coins, for whatever reason that is, then you can subtract approximately 1 million BTC. 
And given that many bitcoins were mined in the beginning, it's not too ridiculous to think that huge sums are sitting on old hard-drives, in defect drives, old computers, in the dump, or whatever. I think the leading cause will be loss of private keys.

I see people argue "not gov. regulation, but market driven natural selection / regulation". Well, a problem is that things don't happen instantaneously, but take time. New exchanges can't just pop up overnight. 
That sort of regulation would result in lots of people losing their money to bad and unscrupulous exchanges.
Furthermore, regulations can deter scammers from starting. Too much risk.

The current problem is that only a minuscule fringe of society cares about this issue, at least in the western world. Those that do, probably identify themselves as libertarians, an-caps, etc. 
To put it this way: In the big picture, they're absolute nobodies. Not of any significance. Most people that have gotten into bitcoin the past months are fortune seekers, gamblers, and just curious people. This includes the institutionalized investors. 
I do not mean any harm by writing this, just putting out my thoughts. There will never be any "revolution" against the governments, most people are dependent on them for jobs, benefits, and you name it.

But you have to ask yourself, even if BTC was made to combat many political aspects (censorship resistant, for example), does the majority of users now care? If there's a compromise in core values. 
If you asked me 5 years ago, I'd say yes, members care(d) about that.
But with the massive influx of new users, that are only after quick gains after reading the newspapers...no, I don't think most of them care about core principles related to political ideologies. 
Most current and future users probably just want some paypal-like service that's not too expensive to use, or magic internet money that continues to go up with xxxx% every year. 
I know it's a limited sample space, but for the past month or so, I can't recall anyone IRL talking about things like privacy or such concerns. 
10 out of 10 times, it's been: 
"Do you know anything about this bitcoin stuff? How do I buy?"
"Have you seen the returns on bitcoins?"
"How much do you think bitcoin will go up the next year" 
"I read about this guy that paid of his house with bitcoins purchased a couple of years ago" 
etc. 
Those are regular Jane's and Joe's, aged 20-something to seniors. 
But point is: If that's how people feel, maybe popular demand is to make bitcoin more scalable, at the price of integrity. Unfortunate for the founders and early users, but that's how it usually works. Things evolve.

Well, Bitcoin is a product based on technology, and unless Bitcoin and its developers keep on making it better, I think something better will replace it. 
It's kind of hard to compare bitcoin and gold, for example. Gold has been valuable for years due to its scarcity, yes, but also because it's a good metal, with good properties. 
But you can't change the properties of gold, silver, copper, or whatever. You can't just upgrade copper, and say "Now it's gold" or "Now it's better than gold [in the domain gold is used]". Sure, there are some things one can do, but you can't change its fundamental properties to becoming gold. 
You can however create and develop better products. So who knows, maybe 5-10-20 years from now, we will have completely different cryptocurrencies on the market. 
BTC is enjoying popularity due to being the most covered and oldest (first-mover advantage). And since most people don't know much, if anything, about the underlying tech, it's easier to just go with BTC. In the sea of dubious coins, at least BTC and some others have credibility.

2. He gave his password. Never ever do this.

He gambled everything on BTC, and is probably praying to god that the gamble pays off. Would suck as to be him 5 years down the line, when the kids are grown up and need more space, and potentially having lost it all. Sorry, dads gamble backfired...better get used to minimalist living kids.

Well, 75% of Americans have under $10k in their savings account. Where the majority of those (39%) have ZERO. 
If those statistics are correct, then quick math says that roughly
126 million Americans don't have any savings 
58 million have up to $1k (total, by taking mean, 29 billion USD)
38 million have $1k - $5k (114 billion USD) 
19 million have $5k-$10k  (142.5 billion USD 
So if 75% of Americans started buying bitcoins with all their savings, they could buy for around $285 billion. The hedge fund Bridgewater Associates alone manages around $125 billions in assets.
Wildly simplified, but just an example that it's still the wealthiest people that have most buying power. In a global transfer, they'd still be the kings. Just think about how much richer the wealthiest people are, and how huge that gap is in most countries. 
Normal people simply don't have enough fiat to do much harm.

Which cryptocurrency is inflationary enough to encourage spending? 
Sure, you can sell the storage of value concept, but for mass adaption you'd think commerce would be the number one factor - as it creates a huge volume. 
If I had the option of:
A) Buy something with BTC, ETH, LTC, or whatever 
B) Buy same thing with USD 
I'd probably go with B. With the cryptos are currently rising, so holding would naturally be the smartest investment. 
Extremely deflationary currencies don't work well in commerce or business. People will simply hold out, as their net worth keeps rising.

Realistically? 
Bitcoins becoming too expensive for people to use. The fees are now so high that the majority of wallet owners can't even spend whatever they have (56% of all wallets have less than 0.001 BTC on them).  
Simply put: It becomes a store of value for rich folk. No mater how fantastic the growth is, you don't earn much if you're not well invested. 
If you hold 0.001 BTC, and BTC / USD reaches $ 1 million, you're worth $1k. But it's all gonna get eaten up by fees at this point. 
So yeah, they really, really need to fix that aspect, or it's gonna be rendered useless for 90% of the population

Start another group (B), where you organize pumping of cryptos. 
Organize pumping events with group B, and then immediately afterwards spam group A with your premium "leads".

hype and media attention.

I have yet to see any form for mainstream adoption where I live (Scandinavia), which is a bit scary, as we (the western world) would be the target audience for investing in BTC - purely because we have more spare USD / EUR fiat, compared to average citizens in other parts of the world.

Some sellers are bound to dump their coins at some random high $ number. They sell it for a less, which creates a dip. 
Then other buy on that dip. This is how it continues, until either BTC stabilizes (as a market winner in some form, or way), or all the large stakeholders decide it's time to cash out, and move onto something else.

My thoughts on Bitcoins: 
1. Right now, people have moved away from the "this is a currency" narrative, to "this is an investment". This is kind of self-perpetuating: If people just keep holding, prices will naturally go up - as long as there are buyers (so it kind of follows a hype). 
How long will people hold? Maybe until they need the money, or can start spending it on serious stuff. Either way, this holding strategy can be viewed as a greater-fool strategy. Per today, the only real value in bitcoin is to trade it for another currency, which you can spend everywhere. Sure, you can spend it some places, that's % is rather tiny. 
Maybe 10 years from now cryptocurrencies will be accepted as legal tender, and there's actual widespread use...but before that, the only real value is that you can trade 'em in for another currencies. 
There are probably tens of thousands of users that see BTC as nothing more than a free ticket to financial independence, with the rising prices. 
So in essence, will bitcoin (and other coins) be a fully-functional currency that people will spend, or is it jut a financial instrument, used for investing? 
2. Before Bitcoins are going to be used on a large scale, the price needs to become more stable. The price needs to flatten out, and there volatility needs to decrease. It would be a nightmare to operate a store where Item A costs 0.001 BTC on day one, and 0.0003 BTC on day ten, and then back to 0.0015 BTC on day 30, to put it a bit extreme. 
We're in the growing pains stage, where there's a ton of volatility. But how long is this going to take?
And there's also a ton of government interest in regulating cryptos. It's a an-cap fever dream to think that governments will just okay unregulated use of cryptocurrencies. One of the greatest crime you can do against a government, is to evade taxes. 
So, even though cryptocurrencies might not be a scam or ponzi scheme, the price is surely following a classic bubble pattern. Yes, totally legit products can follow that pattern, just look at the housing market. 
And the more people that lose money on bubbles, the more regulation follows. Has there ever been a crash / burst that didn't follow government intervention and regulation? 
Remember: Most people are morons when it comes to money. If things blow up too fast, and too many people lose their money, regulations WILL HAPPEN.

The question is, how many others would also sell? If they saw someone dump 30000 BTC. Most buyers / sellers are not rational thinkers, when they're in the (trading) zone. Irrational market psychology alone can crash prices, just check out the forums during crashes.

And ironically, it will be the crypto funds that are going to control the prices - just what crypto enthusiasts didn't want. 
I live in a first-world country, in northern Europe. I've yet to see any widespread adaption of any cryptocurrencies on a consumer level. I'm also going to assume that the casual buyer does not have the buying power to even dent the prices, compared to any half-serious fund. 
At some point, unless adaption really accelerates, the investors (of the funds) are going to cash out, due to stagnation in growth. These funds know that the only thing pushing prices up, and the will of other buyers paying more. And when the only buyers that can make the ticker move are other wealthy guys, some of them are going to pull out. 
What I'm trying to say is: One person with 10 million to invest, has the same buying power as ten thousand of people with $1000 to invest. That's just simple math. But the problem is that most people don't even have $1000 to invest. 
I'm afraid the prices are going to rise too fast, and that it's going to end up as a game of chicken between the wealthy people. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:03:03
I just want to say that everything can be a bubble if there's enough demand. A bubble is not so much about the asset itself, as it is about the market and buyers / sellers reacting. 
In short, a bubble is group-think. It doesn't mater if it's pet rocks, CS skins, gold, bitcoins, some future company with cure for cancer, they all can fall prey for highly speculative actions of the market. 
I think with BTC, one some of the main driving forces have been: 
- 24/7 non-stop media coverage, especially regarding the ATH's 
- Huge influx of institutionalized investors, bringing in MUCH more capital 
- "Dumb" consumer money following, for a quick payday, and some lagging wealth trying to get in. 
Consider this: Half of all Americans have less than $1000 on their savings account. Now imagine how small that sum must be in some third-world country, where the BTC tech would benefit them. 
Most aren't going to drop their life savings on a highly speculative gamble like BTC. It's what enthusiasts with spare cash do. Most non-tech Millennials aren't rich, or tech savvy enough follow this tech over-night. 
My guess is that the BTC prices are being controlled by: 
- Large stakeholders (tens of thousands to millions $ worth of BTC in their portfolio)  
- A very substantial sum of small investors (tens to hundreds, maybe thousands $ worth of BTC) 
And with the news lately, you see more and more of small-time investors hopping on. In any case, look at the sell orders and size of them, and see how they move the needle. 
The main difference between a professional trader, and amateur day traders, is that the pro's know how to control their risk, and know when to cash out. When you're playing with other peoples money, it's better to walk away with 500% returns in a couple of months, than a hypothetical 50000% return. If you lose money, you lose credibility. 
TL;DR: It's mostly people that want to jump on the gravy-train. Market psychology explains the prices right now. When people cash out, it's going to create dips in price...but new sellers will join, because of all the news coverage.

And depending on what country you live in, you may face some pretty harsh penalty taxes if you get caught. 
Here in Norway, that penalty tax (if you get caught on tax evasion) can be up to 60% on capital gains. 
If you're some average Joe that earned close to a million bucks on bitcoin (say you bought them 4-5 years ago), and then go on to spend most on property or other investment without filing taxes, you might face prison and bankruptcy if you can't come up with the 30%-60% penalty taxes. And then it gets sent to the gov. collection agency, which is even more ruthless. 
This is a very fast way for newly minted Millionaires to go bust here, and is especially relevant to gamblers (say Poker) that play abroad, and "forget" to file their taxes correctly. Sadly, it's very often the case that these newly minted Millionaires are clueless on laws, and how to properly do things, as they pretty much became millionaires over night.

The only reason people here like BTC (outside of a few true believers and crypto enthusiasts), is that you can trade them in for fiat. These are the people that have the most fiat, and will continue to be the winners. IF cryptos turn out to be the currency winner, they'll simply trade in their fiat one the way up. 
You're deluding yourself if you think wealthy people will become obsolete or "dethroned" by a bunch of piss-poor millennials or x-gens that happened to buy $10-$500 worth of bitcoins when the prices were low.

I don't have anything against the dank memes, it's more that real critique/serious questions get rebuffed with "FUD","it's a new tech, old theory can't explain this", or some buzzwords that someone saw somewhere, but they're not really sure what means. You can take up any legit concern, and not get a single proof-backed answer. It's all guessing and knee-jerk replies.
 
If a financial advisor told you to put all your money on bitcoins, under the pretense of being "low-risk" investment, you could drag his/her employers ass to the court and sue back everything (depending on where you live). 
I'm not sure if the average poster here understands what risk is, and how important it is in the context of investments. The reason places like r/invest don't advocate BTC, is because it's a very high-risk investment. Hell, it's more of a speculation - not something for people that want time-tested and stable low-risk returns. 
There are many smart people here, that provide solid info on the tech, but the influx of cult-like gamblers (that see themselves as genius investors) has lowered the signal-to-noise ratio.

For someone to become a trillionaire, they'd have to invest around $2.5 billion BTC, when it was around $20 a piece.

It's ironic though. 
Back in the day, people loved bitcoin (and cryptos) because they could buy stuff WITH bitcoins. No middle-man involved, and gov. intervention in form of sales taxes, money trails, etc. 
Today, people love bitcoins because it's worth a lot of in other fiat currencies. BUT they get pissed off about tax rates and whatnot, when they want to exchange their bitcoins into other fiat (USD, EUR, etc.). 
Also, government regulation doesn't always mean "we just want our cut", it's also to provide safety-measurements. 
Imagine if there were no financial regulations, and any bank could just pocket your money and make a run for it. With no regulations, the gov. would just tell you:  
"Well that sucks man, but what can we do? It's your responsibility to pick the right bank, and know the people you're dealing with. Better luck next time!" 
Luckily, this isn't the case, and your money is insured (to a certain limit) if the bank goes bust, or they decide to just steal your money. So remember that, regulations are also there to protect you - as they are to protect the government.

I would estimate that only a tiny portion of the new buyers (the past 4-5 months) give two shits about the blockchain technology. Pretty much EVERY newspaper in the world has been writing about bitcoin prices, on a semi-regular interval, since summer. 
That is going attract insane amounts of totally uneducated buyers, who will just look at the charts, and nothing more. And the more of these we get, the more volatility you're going to see. 
And with more morons losing money on swings, the more likely we'll see government intervention and regulation. Personally I think it's better with longer and more linear adaption, than some exponential shock-curve, which will attract the worst gamblers. 
It's a good time if you're holding lots of coins, and can exploit these price swings.

My personal theory on why BTC can become quite volatile: 
- More institutional traders, like crypto hedge funds. These have much, much capital / buying power than your average Joe. However, unlike die-hard BTC hodlers, a fund has to sell when customers want to cash out. Funds are also more risk-controlled than private investors. 
In essence, I think some of the huge players will cash out as soon as they hit some desired number, or when their investors start to sweat and get nervous. 
- More amateur investors.
These are the people looking for a quick buck, and will sell as soon as there's some volatility. Volatility that can be triggered by big players selling out. 
And in the end, seasoned players will buy up BTC at lows, and hold onto. But as far as market share goes, they're smaller than the number of noobs and pro investors. 
I think the trend is going up, but there will be lots of ups and downs along the way.
Some catastrophically events for BTC hodlers: 
- Countries would outright ban the current. Banks would refuse and close accounts tied to BTC trading. Fines would be given out by gov. (not likely) 
- Some altcoin becomes the market leader. This would me more likely, tbh. Bitcoin has the benefit of being the first player, but not the best (technologically speaking). When the crypto market matures, BTC will become the Yahoo of cryptos. 
So, while BTC seems like a sure-fire investment now, I think, like with every other type of investments, you need a diversified portfolio. Going 100% in on BTC is gambling.

No mater how you slice it, the government wants taxes. Sales taxes, capital gains taxes, income taxes, whatever. It's the lifeblood of any state. 
If they can't regulate a system, in such a way that they can have control of who's paying or receiving what, they will set an example by punishing those that are caught. Harshly. 
I know a lot of libertarians, or even anarchists, are gushing over the thought of cryptos maybe ending taxation, but don't be fooled, that's never going to happen. Not only because governments themselves need the taxes to fund the state, but because MOST citizens in western countries are fine with paying taxes, and enjoying the fruits.

Big crypto funds can manipulate the bitcoin market, for sure. The daily 24 hr trading volume is around ~~44k~~ 876k BTC, which is equal to around $9.6B  - Not sure how much they have now, but I back in September the funds were controlling A couple of Billion worth of $ in crypto assets. 
Edit: And because of the volatility, one might also ask how many of the traders are selling at locals highs, and buying at lower. Either way, I guess the influx of new buyers will accelerate. 
Now, even if none of them control that much in BTC alone, they have the means to swing the market like they want. As many have said before, some $50-$100MM fund will obviously have more buying power than hundreds of thousands of small-time investors spending max $50. 
But why stocks? You diversify your investments. And there have been some tremendously good companies.

How do you value bitcoin? What fundamental analysis can be applied to bitcoins? Or any other cryptocurrency? 
Stocks are relatively easy - you go through their financial statements. You can build statistics, which will tell you where the company is going. 
Foreign currency is harder, as you need to know your macroeconomics, and a many other factors. 
With BTC, you can only look at the charts, and hope it goes up. And hope that 
- No major governments outlaw or put heavy fines / restrictions on cryptos 
- No major exchange or market gets hacked 
- No major competitor takes over BTC, out of the blue 
There's more to investing than betting your life savings on a single number and spinning the wheel.

I'm neither a fanboy, and I'm all for the market to decide what's best. But right now, with the price hysteria, it's easy to see why people root for BTC to be the one and only market-winner. People simply have too much fiat invested in it.

My guess is that every tax agency in the world will be hawking crypto sellers. 
- Don't post about gains on facebook 
- Don't talk to newspapers 
- Don't make anything public appearance on any newfound wealth 
Either sell, and set aside what you owe, or don't, but make a plan and calculate how much is needed
I've noticed a ton of smaller newspapers are hunting for their local "bitcoin guy" - Just in the past two days I saw one local article, and two other (small) local newspapers requesting any people that are holding crypto currencies. 
And guess what people/friends/relatives are doing? They are tagging their friends that are involved, in public facebook posts.

1. Not everyone has to nerves to invest. This goes for everything...stocks, currency, commodities, whatever. The deeper you're into the game, the worse it is. 
2. There are probably some "funds" out there that need to sell when their investors want to cash out. 
Bitcoins are super risky, with lots of volatility. If you're not a true believer, you probably want to be safe than sorry. With the gigantic influx of buyers the past month, most are probably not crypto enthusiasts...but rather just people looking to make a quick'n easy payday.

The probability of guessing a correct sequence of 24 words, where the words are picked from a dictionary with 2048 words, is astronomically low.
Let's say that you have one file on the cloud with 24 minus N words - And one local file with N words. 
The words in your files are shuffled randomly (not in order), meaning that if someone simply added the two lists together, that will not be the correct answer...even if someone had those two lists, it would still be the task of guessing the correct sequence of 24 different items. 
Of course, one might argue that for you to remember the correct sequence, you'd need to make some kind of rule to remember the words (like making a sentence, where each word of the sentence is a word). 
Combinatorics will answer exactly how many combinations you can guess these words. 
I would say with very high confidence, that before anyone managed to string together your word seed, they'd have a astronomically higher chance of obtaining it by getting you to manually type it in (phising site), or having clipboard malware on your computer, or other malware that explicitly looks for files with 24 word combinations on your computer.

Sorry bud, no mater how you try to slice it, BTC on the far, far right side of risk. 
This shouldn't even be a partisan issue - There are too many uncertainties to call BTC (or other cryptos) anything other than high-risk investment right now. Don't tell beginners that BTC is a sure-fire investment that has close to ZERO percent chance of crashing.

My biggest concern on mass adoption is that your average parents have no idea how any of this works, and would just keep all their BTC on coindesk or similar. Then if those sites get hacked, we'd go back years in public trust.

It depends on who you ask. 
A couple of years ago, it was seen as new currency. Today, a lot of people see it as a store of value. 
For bitcoin to be a fully-working currency:
- The price has to even out / less volatility 
- Idiot proof payment and storage systems.  
- Low fees 
As of right now, it's not really idiot proof. You could be a seasoned user, and still get scammed / burnt by doing just one mistake. I'm no hater, but let's face it, for BTC to become a widely used currency, your grandma should be able to use it, without getting scammed.

Actually, the penalty taxes are on top of your regular taxes. 
Say you sell some stocks, and your profit is (equivalent to) $100000, but decide not to report the sale, and just transfer the money to somewhere else. You then get caught red-handed, and need to pay: 
Ordinary taxes (I.e capital gains), and then penalty taxes on top of that (30%-60%), AND any fees or accumulated interest rates. So, in the end, you may have to pay anywhere between 55%-80% on the profits, compared to 20-something in capital gains taxes. 
The absolutely highest tax rate on personal income, would be around 45% (a couple of million and up in income). 
Obviously this is just a very special case here, but I think most serious BTC owners should research the laws in their respective countries. Some of these laws can be quite obscure, as they're not relevant to regular people. If you go from regular to millionaire overnight (like when cashing out your BTC), it's better to be safe than sorry.

Someone sold a bunch of coins. 
edit: Just to explain it a bit more clear: If you wanted to dump, say 100 coins, and speed was of essence, you could just sell them for a cheaper price than the current ask. So even though the price falls a bit, it could just as well go up, as people are buying. But if everyone keeps selling, for cheaper and cheaper, then that could set of a chain reaction in the market / among traders. (Or if a whale decided to dump everything at once, which could be seen as trouble in paradise)

Let's say a cartel of Real-estate funds are vacuuming up the housing-market. Housing prices have been on the rise for a couple of years, so this is a sure-fire investment for these funds. 
After a couple of years, the housing prices are very high. But people will borrow money to buy, because they're sure next year will be better than this year, so it's a win-win situation, right? 
Well, the large funds decide to cash out: Maybe because their investors want the money. Maybe because some other investment opportunities have arisen. There could be multiple reasons. 
Either way, the firms start to flood the market with their units - and the price naturally drops, because supply goes up. Now, the individuals that are heavily invested in the expensive units start to panic: The had envisioned at least 10% rise next year, and now it's stagnating! 
Other RE funds take notice, and sell their units for a bit cheaper. 
Now the hobby-investors start to notice price drops too. They don't really lose much, because they were early investors, but if they sell now, they know they can buy back their units for cheaper later on, if the price drop continues. 
The amateur investors are panicking, having fire sales and what not  - It's clear that in one year, they'll have LOST 10%, not gained any. They can't afford that, as they've borrowed money, or spent their life investments on this project. They want to cut any potential losses. 
A crash happens, and the price is now down 50%. Professional and hobby-investors start buying up, and the process repeats. 
The investors know that the housing market is scarce and finite, so there's no money to be lost, unless housing as we know it gets disrupted. Until then, it's all about holding long, or buying at lows and selling at highs. 
The point is that in heated markets, even smaller dips (caused by major market holders) can set off crashes, simply because of market psychology. Pro and semi-pro investors know this, and will hold out until the desired lows are reached.

It's gambling, nothing more than that. 
Investing is about risk control. If you see some guy take out his life savings, and build up a portfolio of high-risk penny stocks, do you call him a smart investor? Even if one of those stocks quadruple in value. 
So, yes, from an investors point of view, he's an idiot. Being a smart investor is something that takes time - it all boils down to whether or not you can reproduce the same results, year after year. 
It's one thing this sub needs to learn, that cryptos are nothing more than gambling at this point. There's absolutely zero risk management involved. People buy coins, and hope for the best. Even the best predictions are made on instinct and simple regression.
As a gambler, he did a good move. High risk, high reward.

Prohibition never works, but as long as it's for things that most citizens don't care about, no one is gonna do shit about about, unfortunately. And it's very easy for governments to create anti-crypto propaganda (funding terrorism, hacker money, drugs, human trafficking, and what not) 
If a significant portion of Moroccans had stashed away some of their savings in cryptos, they would probably throw a fit. But as it's now, where cryptos are still a hobbyist venture, people won't care. 
Probably something you'll see in another countries soon. Maybe not to ban coins forever, but at least until they've managed to implement a regulatory system, or some way to keep an eye on transactions, for tax and security reasons.

There doesn't need to be a strong correlation between owning cryptos, and believing in them, especially during timess of buying frenzy. 
Kinda like with owning stocks in a company. You don't need to believe in the company, to earn money - as long as you think others will pump up the price. Pretty much the inverse of a long-hold fundamental strategy. You only look at the charts, and hope for a nice payout. 
Lots of bankers (and other people) see that there's money to be made *right now* - But not necessarily in 2-3 years. 
Speculation 
@_date: 2017-09-20 03:01:45
If you want to fight the government, the only possible way is to convince some party that cryptocurrencies are legit. 
And in order to do that, cryptocurrencies need work in a system where tax-evasion and illegal trades is not possible - thus the whole privacy thing goes out the window. 
I understand that a ton of crypto fans lean towards the ancap or libertarian side of things, but those things are not compatible with current governments. Simply put: You are just not fighting an uphill battle, you are fighting an impossible battle, if you do not want to give up privacy part of cryptos. 
If and when governments are starting to lose tax money due to people using cryptocurrencies, the following things will happen: 
A) Cryptocurrencies that are not regulated, will not be legal 
B) Enforcement of draconian anti-crypto laws 
It always boils down to financial crime (i.e tax evasion), every. single. time.

What about infrastructure? Building a small town would alone drain those 200k bitcoins (around $700MM, which btw only holds value as long as they're not using it - and others are hoarding bitcoins) in a year. Where are they going to get their money after that?

From what I've hear and read, I think a lot of regular people jumped on the bandwagon, and dumped far, far too much money (relative to their net worth) on BTC, hoping that the rise would be constant. 
In case they needed some of that money, they'd simply cash out whenever needed. 
Now they are faced with the unlikely scenario: If they cash out, they'll lose big. The only strategy here is to hold out long. 
Lesson learned: Don't dump all your savings on speculative investments, especially not if you need some form of liquidity.
@_date: 2017-09-16 14:57:03
Always have buffer account. 100% liquid, on a moments notice. Sooner or later, you'll find yourself in a situation where a couple of days wait is too long. 
Either that, or at least have credit ready. A credit card with 30-60 interest-free days should also do the trick.
I agree that you shouldn't put your life savings, or even a considerable amount of your savings on a savings account, but you should always consider risk management when dealing with both savings and investments.

People are buying, but not spending. 
And every time the news writes about BTC breaking a new level, more people want in on it. Some buyers are aiming for the stars, others want to make a quick but risky buck. 
In a sense, the current rise can be compared to a classic pump'n dump penny stock scheme. Only instead of a worthless penny stock, it's a complex currency that many owners don't understand. The only thing many DO know, is that if everyone buys and holds, the value will go up. And the insane publicity just keeps attracting buyers. 
If people started spending it on actual products, they would create supply. Store owners would need to sell their BTC to pay for rent, products, salaries, etc. (so long none of those can be bought or paid with cryptocurrencies), so the spent BTC would go back into the market. 
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:48:07
demand. 
Gold has physical uses, and is expensive to extract. If you need to use gold (for physical products), you need to pay for it. That price is a product of demand, and the underlying labor of extraction and production.

I think your reading comprehension is palpable. 
At no point did I say the BTC is a fancy penny stock, I compared its rise and market reactions (market psychology) to those of penny stock pump'n dump schemes. The current drove of buyers come for one reason only, and that's the meteoritic rise in price, and the following publicity. Volatility alone confirms this. 
Do not for a second think that the majority of buyers are seasoned blockchain experts, or have a deep knowledge in cryptocurrencies. It's PURE speculation at this point. 
What would happen to the divine BTC (or other cryptocurrencies) if some other shiny technology came along, and those smart "investors" deemed it to be a better investment? You can try to sell shit for $xxxx a pound, but if there are no buyers, you won't get it sold. 
Same goes for currencies. The buyers ultimately set the price. The S-curve (cumulative adaption curve) fits for successful technologies. It's too early to say if bitcoin will be the winner. Did BetaMax follow the S-curve? No, VHS did. Same goes for cryptocurrencies - some will become winner, others will disappear. And the S-curve will eventually become irrelevant when the next tech comes along and supersedes the previous.  
It sounds like you're too emotionally invested in cryptocurrencies, and simply can't read straight without throwing a tantrum - grow up, or take of your polarized glasses.  
@_date: 2017-10-14 14:40:56
I feel that in order to legitimize BTC (and other cryptocurrencies) as a currency, people need to start spending, not just hoarding. 
The current demand seems to stem from people buying to hold, which naturally perpetuates higher prices, as theres's less supply. 
Hopefully more stores will accept bitcoins as payment (maybe with an incentive, like lower prices), so that type of buyers shift from hoarders to spenders. It's better for cryptocurrencies to have hundreds of millions of spenders, than just a couple of million that hoard and hold onto the coins. 
Edit: I'm not a macro- or microeconomist. I've taken basic economy classes, and of such, I'm not really competent or credible enough to make hard-hitting statements, so take my post with a grain of salt. I've read the economic papers I can find on BTC, seen through classic economics - and you should too, if not for the diverse interest.

Oh, I absolutely believe that people will get killed. But not necessarily because cryptos are a scam. 
If you open up shop, but don't take the security precautions, you are vulnerable to attacks. And all kinds of hastily made exchanges are popping up left and right in various countries...if hackers wipe these clean, essentially stealing the life savings of desperate poor people, I wouldn't be surprised if said entrepreneurs get a hit on them. 
Again, not because bitcoins are bad, but because people aren't thinking clearly, and throwing together things very quickly, and investors / savers buying in before understanding the product, and the vulnerabilities around it. 
Remember: Most regular Jane's and Joe's don't see bitcoins (or other cryptos) as a currency, but simply as a investment product.

I took a e-health class in college, which was just software development aimed at the hospital industry. The main focus was on patient journals. 
What we were told back then (5 years ago), was that a fair share of terminal cancer patient became that way after being forgotten by the hospitals. Data systems had a big blame for this...files becoming lost, notification systems broken, you name it. People would get imaging done, or biopsies, and the results (interpreted by specialists) would be sent to the patient doctor. However, glitches and errors would cause the GP or specialist to not see these messages. Or when trying to access them, there would be errors or that the records had not been properly updated. 
Or when patients transferred to a new hospital, they could not reach the old data, and would assume the patient to be healthy. 
Either way, the patient would get screwed. So, yes, patient journals are very important. Not only that, they are being used (daily) to build very advanced models for sickness detection. One hot area of machine learning is detection systems, where the training data consists of patient journals.
