I mean, yes, But not exclusively. Anyone who has ever taken out a mortgage has traded with leverage.

Nothing at all. It's why people trade with leverage.
A couple of points though:
1. The individual would need some collateral to take out the loan. This is so if BTC drops from 5k to 1k the exchange can get their money back. If we assume 50% collateralization the individual would need at least 2 million in assets on the exchange
2. The user is at risk of losing their collateral + the interest. Let's say the scenario above occurred and the user secured 2 million worth of BTC to borrow 1 million to buy more BTC. Let's also assume that this individual is paying 10% interest on the loan.
* They start with 400 BTC (2 million in BTC at $5000 each)
* They borrow 1 million and buy 200 BTC (1 million in BTC at $5000 each)
* At the end of one year they OWE $1,100,000  (the borrowed money + 10%)
If the price of BTC **rises** to $20,000 then the final balance for the individual looks like this
* 400 BTC \* $20 thousand = $8 million
* They sell 200 BTC for $20,000 a coin = $4 million
* They pay off the $1.1 million
* They are left with $10.9 million.
If the price of BTC **drops** from $5k to $1k then at the end of 1 year they have:
* 400 BTC \* $1,000 = $400,000
* 200 BTC \* $1,000 = $200,000
* They owe $1.1 million
* Final balance = -$500,000
This is why leverage is so risky. It's also **very powerful**. Vast fortunes, or inescapable poverty can be the result. Be careful

This is what I say whenever anyone tells me **anything** needs a correction or is correcting.
What is the correct price of Amazon? Berkshire Hathaway? BTC? ETH? Apple?
EDIT: I get that a fair valuation **range** can be established for public equities, and there's some progress in defining valuation metrics for cryptocurrencies.
The point I was trying to make (but was unclear, that's my fault), is that I think that a social 'table stake' to enter a conversation about a 'correction' should be what 'you' believe a fair price range actually is.

What I did is that at regular intervals I would pull down 50% of cap gains (if any) until I had withdrawn all that I put in
