Woah, this also totally correlates with my gastrointestinal stress levels after eating bad Indian food. It’s a sign. Maybe that’s why that QuadrigaCX guy went to India. He must have had the same vision.

I went to Buenos Aires for a few weeks earlier this year and saw zero traces of Bitcoin. We took a few Uber’s and it wasn’t available as a payment option, though, maybe it’s changed since then.

I’m actually surprised this didn’t end with one of those Facebook-esque “share this with at least 10 friends or you will die in 7 days” shenanigans...

The security issue is the problem here. This is a terrible idea.

~~Interesting, didn’t know this. Do you know if the banks mark PayPal with some type of fee structure like they do with Coinbase? If not, then: 
Bank -&gt; PayPal -&gt; Coinbase could be a fee-less deposit solution~~

I can’t watch the video - what is it showing? Can someone describe it to me? The dial-up in my grandmas basement isn’t good enough for streaming. I hope it is showing some sort of moon price prediction so I can move out of here.

Whoops :) thanks for the correction

And as mentioned above, open up huge security risks where coins are no longer in cold storage.

~~Just looked up some of the details. This actually is significant because it might be a way to circumvent the fees banks are charging right now for using Coinbase (even with debit cards).~~
Edit: ignore me...I’m not a learned man. Read this incorrectly. This is pointless as it’s only the withdrawal portion and PayPal limits on withdrawals to bank are substantially worse than Coinbase...
