Yea you’re a genius man. I bet you timed the most volatile market ever perfectly. And yes I’m salty
@_date: 2018-01-19 23:00:59
Gemini is not worse, it’s actually a lot better.
@_date: 2018-01-24 00:31:39
Yea exactly what it means... lolol
@_date: 2018-01-19 22:55:12
Just think of how cheap and fast it will be when it drops to $100
@_date: 2018-01-09 00:12:00
Nope, your public key wallet address is always in existence, you can send crypto to it whenever regardless if it’s plugged in
@_date: 2018-01-31 23:43:23
Gosh I wonder why they keep banning you....
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:07:59
Bottom amount first top amount second
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:04:05
No it’s not.
@_date: 2017-12-22 20:06:47
Not even close
@_date: 2017-12-02 23:02:36
Gemini has a way higher limit, I want to say 100k? Coinbase is per week, Gemini is per day
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:45:42
No this has never happened before, bitcoin cash was added to coinbase. It’s faster and cheaper then btc. Good luck everyone

Bitcoinpaperwallet.com have fun paying the 20 dollars in fees because bitcoin has become useless as a currency
@_date: 2017-12-20 18:20:19
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:42:37
Such a smart move! Lolol
@_date: 2017-11-25 17:07:42
And what happens if bitcoin goes down in value? You then have to pay off credit card debt with money you don’t have at a 25% interest rate
@_date: 2017-11-22 04:01:18
Yea but the people I’m giving it to don’t really know much about crypto other than bitcoin. Hence a paper wallet with bitcoin would be a much better gift I would think than giving them vertcoin. I get your point though
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:18:20
That’s really irresponsible to say that
@_date: 2017-11-07 01:44:36
In what sense? I’ve used Bank of America and Chas with no issues so far
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:18:26
More people are selling then buying
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:48:28
Great post!
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:12:37
Realized gains are what is taxable, your original cost is not
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:47:52
Did the same thing to me, Gemini.com is way better I’ve been using t for a while and way lower fees
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:35:16
If you can figure out how to time the bitcoin market let me know
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:52:58
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:25:36
Yea, but purposely putting yourself into credit card debt for a speculative investment like crypto is very risky
@_date: 2017-11-26 21:45:05
Great post man!
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:22:17
Was thinking about doing this for Christmas, anyway you could fill us in on how you did that? Would offer a tip!
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:22:05
First time anyone’s ever posted this question!
@_date: 2018-03-09 17:53:05
Keep telling yourself that
@_date: 2018-02-19 15:32:53
@_date: 2018-03-07 18:38:00
Unless you’re putting new fiat in, no it doesn’t 
@_date: 2018-02-06 03:05:44
How low will it go before bitcoin people stop saying hodl?
