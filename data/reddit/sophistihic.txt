So the seller could keep the buyer's address on file and the buyer could then repurchase by sendin. BTC to the unique address generated by the seller. What happens when the company is out of the product, goes out of business, loses the secret key or is hacked? In all of these cases you lose your money.

I met some of the blockchain.info guys last year at a SF Bitcoin dev meet up.  They were very cocksure but my impression was that the recently acquired software they were demoing was pretty lame and half-baked.  This seemed like a major quality control problem to me at the time which seems to have become endemic in the company.
blockchain.info's corporate structure is distributed, i.e they have no central office.  While I think this is a great idea, I suspect a breakdown in communications and a good helping of arrogance is leading to their downfall.

@_date: 2014-12-01 22:26:03
Coders of decentralized apps/services need to get paid as good or better than those who work for centralized companies.  With out this we will never fully shift away from centralized organizations.
The key to the problem is to fairly reward those who do the best work.  From a developer's perspective it's best to get paid before doing the work.  From the community's perspective the opposite is true.  Mitigating and sharing the risk is important.
Dumping a ton of money into a project up front risks too much of the community's resources.  However, if a developer waits to be paid until the end they are likely never to be fairly compensated because few will pay for what they've already got for free.  The only remaining solution is to pay as you go but this requires an accurate way to evaluate progress.  Any project manager or developer knows this is very difficult to do.  Vaporware is always 80% done.
Bounties are worth exploring but as a developer I'm not terribly encouraged by them.  They are usually too small and there's a huge risk that of spend a lot of time only to have the bounty sniped by someone else.  Only inexperienced developers can take on such risk.  Also, if multiple good developers are working on the same problems there will be a lot of wasted resources.
Currently the best way is to tip developers who are producing what you like and keep on tipping them and encouraging others to do so through out the process.  Recurrent tipping commitments could go a long way towards mitigating risk while still encouraging developers.

This is great. It finally means a relief of the downward price pressure caused by mining. This price pressure must be at least equal to the cost of mining but no more than the current value of the coins produced. As difficulty relaxes the cost of mining goes down. Miners can then afford to sell less coin. We may finally be close to the bottom.

The barely discussed incredible negative aspect of lightning networks is that you have to tie up your Bitcoins in one or more payment channels.  Meaning you cannot access your Bitcoins to pay outside of the payment channels you are committed to with out closing one or more of your channels.  This means you will likely get stuck with a few mega payment channels that everyone has to use because the cost of on chain transactions is so expensive and they will have become the only way to reliably reach other users with out going on chain.  This oligopoly of payment channels will make big bucks and control the network.  They will likely be forced to disclose transaction information to governments and Bitcoin will have zero anonymity.  These payment channels will also enforce KYC and AML rules.  Welcome to the brave new Bitcoin.

More worshiping of the core devs by people without much technical skill.  There is no reason to believe that the current core devs are the best choice for the job of making all technical decisions about Bitcoin's future.  Sure they've got some skills but that does not make them the Gods some of the community make them out to be. They are the guys that were around at the time Bitcoin was emerging who had nothing better to do and were savy enough or lucky enough to jump on the Bitcoin train early.  Most really good devs are really busy developing software.  Bitcoin core is currently in the hands of a few kids who were hanging around crypto fourms in 2010.  That needs to change.

Why would you commit your coins to just any node?  Creating a viable node will require tying up large sums of Bitcoin.  Why would anyone do this if it did not make them money?  It follows logically that their will be only a small number if well connected nodes and they will control the network.  With limitations on the main blockchain, transactions will become expensive.  If this were not true, what would be the point of lightning networks?

Ready yourself for the herd of knuckleheads here to tell us that this doesn't matter.  A miners market is very bad for Bitcoin.  If the miners are able to make too much money they will stockpile Bitcoin instead of spending it on electricity and hardware.  They then be come bearwhales.  As soon as one of them panics and starts selling there will be another crash.  The best situation for Bitcoin as a whole is were mining is just barely profitable.  Then the miners sell most of the Bitcoin they earn, like they normally do.

1. Segwit is complicated and is thus a step away from the KISS principal.
2. There is significant risk that a bug or security hole in Segwit could bring down Bitcoin.
3. A lot of people feel that Segwit was mainly designed to further Blockstream's goals.  Blockstream, who pays many of the Bitcoin core developers, hopes to get a return on their investment by implementing Lightning networks which are not possible without Segwit.  This is a potential conflict of interest.
4. Some miners fear it may reduce the fees they will be able to collect in the future.
I do not know if these are good enough reasons to block Segwit but they are legitimate reasons worth some consideration that have nothing to do with secret agendas or conspiracy theories.

What are you talking about this article delivers all the fluff and BS that the title promises and I am very pro Bitcoin.
"The graph I chose to show you looks kind of like the graph around the time Bitcoin went to the moon."  This is the kind of stupid arguments for buying Bitcoin that we don't need.

I'll never forget the blank look on Karpeles face as he walked into his office, iced frappuccino in hand, in the middle of the Gox crisis.  Good to see he's still not having a clue.

Wait a minute.  So you're smart enough to find a freelancer in the Philippines, send Bitcoin, attach pictures to an email and create a Web presentation about it but too dumb to resize your own pictures?  Was this just to prove a point?

But the supply of liquid BTC will go down.  Presumably this event will not affect demand so unless other factors intervene the price must go up.

The price will go up because of reduced sell pressure.  Most miners sell most of the Bitcoin they earn to pay for electricity and hardware.  This is self evident if you crunch the numbers for building out a mining operation even in locations with the cheapest power.
Therefore, when half as much Bitcoin is created every 10 minutes then about half as much of that Bitcoin will be sold every day.  (Some bonehead is going to read this and think I'm saying that 1/2 as much Bitcoin will be sold per day.  Read it again.)   Currently I estimate miners must sell about $600k USD worth of BTC daily.  This should go down to about $300k at todays prices when the block reward halves.  This is a significant portion of the market and will likely lead to rising prices.

You could say 1 bit = 0.025 cent.

Great, next time I want to lock up my Bitcoin and then send it all to the same person I'll look for "lightening" network.  You know you could do the same thing in one transaction on the main chain right?

@_date: 2017-05-25 21:10:04
Right but my Bitcoins can only participate in one channel at a time.  Therefore they must be locked up with one entity.  I have to hope that that entity is centralized enough to be able to convince enough other people to lockup coins with them in order for a network to form.  This will result in a small network of gatekeepers which get to decide what it costs to send Bitcoin.
In the example in the video, there is no network.  There are just two entities on a single channel and they are sending 100 transactions when it would be much easier to just send one transaction.
You think it's bad now with the control a small group of miners is able to exert over the network?  LN will make things much worse.
