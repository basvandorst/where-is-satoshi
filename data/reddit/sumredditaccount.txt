You are probably comparing the prices of two different exchanges. One is being liquidated on bitfinix and you are using another exchange as reference. Usually those going long on btc are liquidated when the price falls because they run out of margin (depending on the leverage they use). So they are liquidated because Bitcoin is falling, just like people shorting bitcoin are liquidated when the price increases enough to have them run out of margin.

Damn you missed some serious gains the last few weeks. RIP

Ok than there is a delay with reporting in the bot. The meaning of liquidation means they have no more margin to cover the price fluctuations so their positions are automatically closed by bitfinix. These are not voluntary. Read up on margin trading if you are confused about it.

There is nothing condescending about my replies. I'm just telling you what whale calls means

I'm not going to take a side here because the market is complicated but would you have held when bitcoin went from 1000 to 100 over many months? Or would you have sold before it went down 90 percent?

Why are you showing liquidations to support your point?

They are getting liquidated because they run out of margin due to price fluctuations.  They are in response rather than being the cause

While I don't disagree with it being a poor comparison, to act like the stock market is some safe haven from huge losses is delusional. Having "fail safes" and being "regulated" has not saved it before. That being said, not sure it is ready to go bear yet.
