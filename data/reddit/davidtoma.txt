How exactly does it live up to its name if "Trezor" isn't even a word...
EDIT: Okay, I get it. You can stop with the downvotes and sending me wikipedia links. Maybe start reading replies everyone once in a while?

Do the guys who make the Mycelium videos drop acid before doing them?

The banks don't like it because it's decentralized and they see that as sketchy so they don't want their customers using it.

Just checked it. This is great. I plan on starting something small with a couple of friends and accepting Bitcoins as an option. This will be very useful for that.

"Bits" is the most useless measurement of Bitcoin. It's like measuring Zimbabwean Dollars.

How about we continue being hipsters and keeping bitcoin as "underground" as possible.

What about PayPal? Do they still freeze accounts involved with Bitcoin? I know they allow merchants now, but I'm still wary of it.

wait what?

Oooohh, That explains why Google came up with basically nothing when I searched "Define Trezor"
Makes sense now.

You can tell because there are random pixels around the replaced areas. Also, the edited text is significantly clearer than the rest of the image.

Chase. I have heard multiple times of them closing accounts after using bitcoin.

What an idiot...

Do you think I've gone too far?

Kindof a general question, but how can I use a debit card to buy the bitcoins if my bank (and most if not all banks) are against bitcoin in their TOS?

It is much easier ti find VPS or Dedicated server hosts that accept bitcoin and since it's ridiculously easy to set up a Minecraft server, a VPS might be a better choice (If you know the basics of how linux works)
Cubedhost used to accept bitcoin at the address  but its giving a blank page on my phone. I don't know about PC monitors.
