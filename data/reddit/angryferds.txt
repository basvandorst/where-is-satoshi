How much bitcoin (in USD) is actually the average range for newbies and young folk? I see everyone here investing thousands or tens of thousands into BTC, while a young student like me can only put in the equivalent 6-10 USD every time I decide to buy in.

But he took profit money to buy the truck. I would argue that scraping off parts of your BTC off the table to buy real-world goods from time to time is not bad. After all, that's the only time you actually profit.
At the end of the day, "HODL-til-I-die" will not give your profits until you've traded them out. Until then, they’re only “net” and “on paper.” A relatively unstable fiction waiting to be realized.
Of course, investing into the technology (and not for the profit) is a different discussion.
