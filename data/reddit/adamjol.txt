It's unbelievable

Using the new CLTV a site like this is possible. The public transaction data contains the block height or time stamp when it can be spent and this could be aggregated into live stats.

Can't find your Bitcoin address - classy actually. Good read so far.

In fairness we've learned that's a loose term, but bad news nonetheless.

Looks like a fun family activity - the trolls on this post are strong though, don't listen to them.
@_date: 2015-04-04 22:47:58
Actually 100% legit. Thanks for this bookmark.

Yes, I can check that it was counted. But who issues my "voting card" or whatever? I could be one person voting ten times.

That's funny coming from a troll

When will there be one in Homan Square?

Crypto coin news? Scam in itself
@_date: 2015-03-05 23:29:31
Not kidding, they accept cash fast and dispense it faster. The BitAccess ones struggle to accept each bill and dispense at a snails pace. They also have buggy software. My personal fav is a Lamassu though.
@_date: 2015-03-13 15:58:46
Cash deal only, below market value since the buyer doesn't know if tampered.
@_date: 2015-03-14 13:39:25
Coin kite does
@_date: 2015-03-08 17:12:50
So back to the single point of failure we already have.. Just playing devils advocate.
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:47:29
But BitAccess ATM's are unreliable? Despite controversies with Robocoin I've found the hardware to be the best.

So I get that assets can be tracked and traded on the blockchain. But how do I know that the bottle of medicine in front of me is that asset I can 100% verify online?
If everyone can see the assets, can't they just put any valid public key on the bottle?
Edit: Brainstorm time: there could be a privkey inside the genuine bottle that lets me "exhaust it" on the blockchain using my phone easily with their app. Then scammers would never know if the asset they copy and "holographic seal" could be exhausted before their counterfeit is sold. That same app could be used by customers to scan the outside of the bottle and ensure it hasn't been exhausted before paying.

What happens if you click the green trade button?

Had to do a double take when I saw PayByCoin. Forgot it was called that.

I just sent them 25 BTC - will it clear soon?

I just sent them 25BTC and I'm having the same problem...

Sweet! I knew I was missing some details - looking forward to the project it looks like good work.

I just sent them 25 BTC, when will it show up?

What a terrible idea - paper counted by hand is the only way to vote. All electronics can be compromised.
This could only work for like a city councillor etc where the stakes aren't as high for the NSA to get involved.

Ditto. You first :)

I think your implementation of touchID is sweet. You are a very good user experience designer.

Lenovo had a major blunder this week that likely spells the end of their company/brand.
It was highly technical but basically when you see the "Lock" when you connect to online banking on your Lenovo laptop, it might not actually be locked and was leaking data that was supposed to be secured.
@_date: 2015-02-21 00:20:51
Lock your phone

Yea what was up with that!
@_date: 2015-02-22 08:36:39
But not with the click of a button. It takes hundreds of people in collusion.

You wouldn't know it since BitcoinWisdom refuses to update to add Coinbase exchange and not just coinbase brokerage.
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:23:34
Thanks - that was my feeling.

lets just keep this thread going about cnn

Interesting thought - that the block solutions are actually some food into another system and we're doing the work for him - except that the work the miners are doing is mundane. 
Eg tell me a number thats 20 digits long, the first ten digits are zeros and it checksums the latest transactions in the last ten minutes. Likely not useful for any other purpose.
@_date: 2015-03-05 08:28:05
For you it's not a small amount.
@_date: 2015-02-19 08:18:25
Great idea...
@_date: 2015-02-21 23:49:12
I'd guess $1-$5 - it's really subjective based on your order. No clear pricing online.

I just deposited 25 BTC but it's not showing up?
@_date: 2015-02-22 16:38:54
No problem - since the software generates the key pairs it just uses non random ones.

Can I borrow 25 BTC? I need to pay back the loan while I wait for bter.com to refresh my deposit.

Yep - haven't heard of anyone getting any money out this week.

I texted them and they said no problem what do i need

Can someone explain to me why Quantum computers (or just really fast computers in the future) are guaranteed not to be able to generate every possible keypair? I understand the number of possible keypairs is like 2^160 (unimaginable) but it's still a number.
@_date: 2015-02-23 20:02:19
That volatility killed 'em. /s
