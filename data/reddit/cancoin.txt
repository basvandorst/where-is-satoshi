Our wallet is infinitely less intrusive than coinbase and we don't hold user keys. Our exchange will be p2p and our wallet is already mobile. We LOVE coinkite! Proud to be in the same category and just as secure as them. We're the new kids, we're not going anywhere and we're awesome.

When I say "proof of work" I actually mean "proof of product" which we will be rolling out over the next quarter and will include the multi-signature wallet and p2p global marketplace.  Signup for our beta and stay in the loop.

Use the ones you trust the most. Blockchain.info is good, but my balance has been -$9.56 for a long time...(which is weird) aaand we just released our wallet in beta so maybe it might be of future use to you.  (you can play around with it using testnet coins. If you're saving it for a long time create a paper wallet and keep it somewhere safe.

We're a small Canadian startup of three.  Our developer and ux designer are brothers and our startup founder and director is an old friend of both. Together we have the talent, skills and knowledge to compete with the biggest players in the space simply through proof of work. We're moving slowly and surely but because we don't have "circle" funding Cancoin is a part time passion.  Our mission is a little altruistic in that we want to empower the people of the world and no lack of cash will stop us. We want to impress and satisfy the overall Bitcoin community and help newbies feel safe when using/buying/selling/storing BTCs.  You can follow  to speak directly to our founder and PR director.

Hey reddit, Our first public introduction of our company, Cancoin. Sign up to be first on the list for our wallet release and global marketplace. Follow us to the moon!!

This is great. For people worried about companies like this or changetip using offchain txs i think they need not worry. Once they are over bitcoined....they will buy more.

Good on bitcoin.org moderators!!

My gf just returned from holidays in Siberia, Russia. She knows im into btc and she mentioned it amongst her friends (age 24-26). In a group of aprox. 10 she said half had heard of it and "knew" how it worked....So despite attempts at blocking info the youth is still engaged and interested in this experiment. 
@_date: 2015-01-29 20:40:32
testnet can be found at

thanks for the tip @_date: 2015-01-07 16:46:00
great tip @_date: 2015-01-29 20:41:15
yes, more bullish. 
@_date: 2015-01-15 23:09:20
there are many more uses cases then illicit goods trade; remittances, international money transfer, micro-payments, financial services... and the list goes on and on and on....
@_date: 2015-01-07 16:22:05
that sounds like it might take more than 48 hrs
@_date: 2015-01-07 20:13:27
never heard of that. thanks for the tip @_date: 2015-03-22 21:58:51
i suppose this awesomeness assumes true transparency in all assets.
@_date: 2015-03-22 22:02:25
True decentralization is very difficult when dealing in physical goods that need storage/care-taking, though that would be ideal.
 
@_date: 2015-03-05 20:31:05
so what incentives a teller to risk their life trading money?
@_date: 2015-03-08 18:16:22
TED is a cult with many rules. Participants PAY upwards of $10,000 dollars + to participate. Perhaps this is a reason. 
@_date: 2015-02-20 06:30:55
Everything is in stealth - happening behind closed doors, getting it done right. Dell, Microsoft, stripe etc. don't announce they are accepting btc and then start developing. 
HUGE Monumental uses of the bitcoin blockchain will come to fruition over the next 2-20 years and in the end the value that needs to transfer over the same amount of tokens will increase ----&gt; until bitcoin and the blockchain are as hard to dislodge as the current paradigm.
@_date: 2015-02-10 18:55:29
there are still 7.3mln bitcoins coming down the line.
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:35:06
hmm, A cnn show during primetime would really help ; )
@_date: 2015-02-23 17:23:42
Pressure from other payment providers? Leaving bitcoin as an option is free so im curious to hear why they removed it.
@_date: 2015-03-05 03:01:23
What is the incentive for a "teller" to become a teller? Why risk accepting money from strangers? Surely tellers will charge a fee - where does the money come from to pay the developers if it's free? Very curious.

Dont do business without multisig. &lt;---full stop!

We've been in beta for 6 months at  you can use testnet coins with that wallet (the exchange is not there).  Our wallets are 2of2 multisig, meaning you have a key and there is an encrypted key on our cc server. Our exchange is 2of3 multisig, meaning the buyer has a key, the seller has a key and cc has a key. All keys are secured in a 24/7 uptime secured facility on HSM's.  We built this system based on what this community asked and with security and ease of use as our main focus. Of course, we think people will like the UX and UI as it is sleek and beautiful (majorly biased).

 coming soon... we're not asking for community money, we are self funded. We're also as close to decentralized as possible. We found that instating complete autonomy in the exchange is very difficult because of scammers. We use multi-sig escrow and we arbitrate bad deals manually. i.e. if one of the transacting parties doesn't fulfill their side of the contract by not paying or sending payment the coins are locked until a resolution is found, including legal prosecution (in worst case senario). Based on a reputation system and a voluntary verification system cancoin will use what we believe is an even balanced method of exchange where all parties are protected. Our wallets also use HSM's, BIP32 protocol (BIP44 ready) and no personal info (save an email) is necessary for an account. Localbitcoins 2.0 - next month - Cancoin  
@_date: 2015-02-21 18:44:38
cancoin - launching next month - will be P2SH 2of2 (multi-sig) and not require any personal information except an email. You will also be able to trade on the go similar to localbitcoins (except with a 2of3 multisig escrow in between).
