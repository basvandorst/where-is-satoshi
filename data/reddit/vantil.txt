You had one comment that was facetious because you apparently didn't have any other response to my questions.  Your other comments ITT have been straight up asinine.  You're either a troll or an idiot.  I was trying to give you the benefit of the doubt.

There is an old systems engineering adage that "The whole is greater than the sum of its parts".
Your ideology contends that parts should work independently rather than as a whole if that means that the whole is under the tyranny of  (*gasp*) a manager.
An engineering firm operates on the basis of design engineers working for program management, who in turn work for executive leadership. These engineers design technological advances which are sold by the company.  In return, the engineers are paid a salary.  By your definition, they are wage slaves.
However, without the leadership, vision, and direction from management, engineers would never design a system that functioned properly, could be mass produced, or could be created in a reasonable amount of time.
Imagine, how *amazing* our national highways would be if the civil engineers and construction workers who designed and built them had subscribed to your ideology.

In what governmental system are people able to survive without work?  


Care to elaborate on this?  How does one keep from being exploited?

I was under the impression that that sub was for people who embarrass themselves by pretending to know what they're talking about.
Or am I thinking of a different sub?

Isn't that the same thing?

By your standards, no engineering firm would ever exist.  
Enjoy your ideal world without technology and infrastructure!
