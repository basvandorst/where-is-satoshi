@_date: 2017-12-21 16:42:25


Full stop. Every individual trade is a taxable event if you turn your crypto into anything other than the original crypto.
This can get pretty complicated pretty quickly which is why I recommend a CPA so strongly.
Either way your cost basis wouldn't be zero. You still spent money initially. Even if you bought in at ten dollars.

Nah fuck Charlie. If he doesn't have enough faith in his own coin to hodl, then neither do I. "Its about transparency" is a cop out he tells to the sheep. Satoshi never sold his coins. (But I guess he's probably dead so that may be a moot point)
If he said he was buying back in at some point, or if he said he needed to support his family then whatever. But that's not the case.

Shit you could even make a new exchange that doesn't suck.
@_date: 2017-12-21 02:52:52
Just to make it painfully clear, the IRS does not fuck around with shit like this. They will absolutely rape you with interest and penalties. If you have substantial income from crypto (like a significant part of (or more than lol) your yearly income) then just go to a CPA and get them to do your taxes. My firm charges ~$2-300 per return but you're getting someone that went to college specifically for this, and are certified by the state to do this. The upside to this too is it helps adoption because you'd be exposing someone to crypto that might not have otherwise heard of it!

If, for example, you bought at 5k and 20k, your losses from 20k go against your profit from 5k. If you bought a little at 5 and a lot at 20 you'd probably end up with a loss. If you bought a lot at 5 and a little at 20, you'd probably have a gain overall.
This is ofc with made up numbers, and assuming you sell the entire thing. I do recommend talking to a CPA if you have big gains from crypto.

A full crypto society would largely function just like ours does now. Your employer is already reporting your earnings to the IRS. They already know. Your bank is already reporting interest income and some dividend income. A tax return is your chance to say "wait! My tax liability is actually lower because of xyz!" As far as property taxes? Your local government is already sending you a bill, you have to pay it out of pocket.
Now if you are talking specifically capital gains and losses in a schedule d, then yes it would be difficult for them to know that you bought/sold bitcoin. But in a world where btc (or whatever) has  replaced fiat, you aren't going to be buying crypto.

Capital losses are deductible, but only up to 3k before triggering a carry forward. If you invested every penny in a shit coin you would have 97k of taxable income (100-3), and would be able to  take a loss carry forward.
See its notice 14-21 Q-6, which explicitly states losses are allowed. The instruction you are quoting pertains to property such as houses and cars.

Yeahup, and they have also stated that you realize a gain and loss on it.
Q-6: Does a taxpayer have gain or loss upon an exchange of virtual currency for 
other property? 
A-6: Yes. If the fair market value of property received in exchange for virtual currency exceeds the taxpayer’s adjusted basis of the virtual currency, the taxpayer has taxablegain. The taxpayer has a loss if the fair market value of the property received is lessthan the adjusted basis of the virtual currency.
