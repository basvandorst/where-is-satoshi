If the patent holder has money to throw at lawyers and the other party doesn't they can tie up claims and just make any claimant give up from lack of funds.

Sounds nice. The banks around here are heading towards automation through upgraded ATM's. Some of them don't even take coins, it's frustrating when you have them all counted out in the right bags/amounts and they just refuse.
@_date: 2015-06-23 09:36:12
I use them, they're a ripoff for conversion so I only use coins that aren't worth counting. 2 minutes to get €20 vs over an hour.. Anything lower than 20c just isn't worth the time.
I'd gladly put them in to a BTC machine instead, that could be easy to do if the machines where talking back to base or a BTC service (but that seems like the hard part) The one I use at the moment prints out a receipt you can use for groceries or claim back at the customer service desk so it's not too far off a BTC coin machine.

No, they're not likey to buy a bitcoin when they see the price so they won't even become first time buyers. Unless they do their research and learn how divisible it is.

Faulty wiring, coiled power cables leading to an inductive loop or overloaded circuits. Hard to tell but that place looks like the door to a wiring nightmare.

They won't ban it. 
It was used in ransomware, you can track everything when you have control of the tumblers and can raid exchanges. When you leave a paper trail that everyone has access to it's amazing!
They'll ban the other shitcoins that promote and enable privacy.

So your using the Satoshi as a concept as the lowest value while everyone else is using it as a fixed fraction of Bitcoin?

Your right, it'll all turn out to be scam in the end. They always do.

Paypal has gotten a bad name with bitcoin so many people don't trust it due to the ease of "I didn't get my goods! Get me my moneys back paypal!" and the lack of proof of delivered bitcoins (I've been told it's against paypal t&amp;c's as well)
The main way to get btc's or mtgox credit is to go on the bitcoin forums and look for reputable traders on the market forum -  Just don't rush in to a trade with someone that has a low post count. Read the forum for awhile and some of the previous threads to get an idea of how things work.

It won't encrypt your wallet automaticly, you have to tell it to encrypt it and provide a password/passphrase so you can decrypt the wallet..
To answer the question, if you click on settings and the option to change passphrase is greyed out then your wallet is not encrypted.
*edit - Also there's a lock in the lower right hand corner that will say "Your wallet is encrypted and currently Locked"

There was some guy on the bitcoin forums giving 0.1 to go to a site and tweet a message advertising the site and bitcoin guide he/she had made. The method they used for tweeting was... suspicious to say the least, gives them more access to your twitter account. Perhaps it's not intentional on the users part but it really looks like the service they use is there to harvest user data tbh.
There's always the betting sites, like that [Kamikaze one](

Does amazon have it as an e-book? Been looking around a little and can't find anywhere to buy it except for the German versoin.

Besides the really obvious, reputation and ease of getting your hands on the cash. Also the volume moved, whose to say you'll get to sell at the higher price on the other site.

Some banks do that with chip and pin, it's rare but happens sometimes here.
"How could someone use your card without the pin number! You must have given it to them."

I had a look through my account this morning and seen 25 failed attempts from Russian or Eastern European IP's in the last week or two. I didn't have time to look into it more but I'm sure there's plenty more failed attempts. I have 0.05 with them from recent purchases, time to get that out when they're back up!

Sorry for the second reply but it seems that the person that offered the 0.1 btc has been warned now, harvesting twitter account info/access.
Look twice before accepting free virtual currency.

Perhaps Paypal is the T-rex and bitcoin is the asteroid of looming extinction.

If the difficulty stayed the same it might take a year but it keeps going up so it'll take longer to pay itself off.

I don't blame you, that page is a rambling pile that doesn't have much info, the news paper article they posted is from nearly a month ago. "Burning the bond holders" is what Iceland basically did and they're fine, although they seem to have a brain in their head compared to shambles that is the Irish government. Wasn't the Cyrpus problem the opposite? They didn't default on bonds and had to pay them so they screwed over deposit accounts?
At the moment the Irish Government is talking about raising the retirement age and forcing people to pay 15% of their pay in to a pension fund. I haven't bothered investigation if they'll make it mandatory to have a private pension or if they'll manage the fund themselves. If they manage it themselves then it's basically a tax. We've had a huge pension reserve that would have been used for those that didn't have a pension, that reserve got raided a few times to bail us out of problems and they won't be able to replenish it.
TL:DR Current public pension is drying up, retirement age going up, mandatory contribution to private pension so they government doesn't have to pay any more money when people retire.

This is probabaly aimed at the people who have never used bitcoin and it woild serve as a push for them to find out a bit more.

Pension contributions aren't taxed at the moment but the pension target they're talking about is more then likely the public pension fund that the government manages. It's a huge amount they've dipped in to a few times and now they won't have enough to pay public pensions when people retire. They'll force people to get their own private pensions instead of them relying on the state to pay the pension, which they could have done if they didn't waste it.

In the US? I can't see many people doing searches to get basic info on their own currency.
I haven't heard anyone use the term "US doller" it's either dollar, and the use a prefix to specify a different currency, or American dollar.
