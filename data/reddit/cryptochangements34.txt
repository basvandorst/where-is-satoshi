Lower fees, are however, what they want

[Some major musicians like Mariah Carey and G-Eazy accept it for their merch]( along with other assorted services, similar to Bitcoin. Monero is also replacing Bitcoin on DNMs. The thing that used to really set Bitcoin a side alts in terms of merchant adoption was the major retailers like Steam, Microsoft, and Dell. Those retailers have all dropped Bitcoin, so between Monero and Bitcoin I would say the merchant adoption is pretty similar.

I still don't see Monero or Ethereum going anywhere. Lightning takes a stab at their goals but they are still light years ahead of lightning in those aspects.

Like getting it integrated in merchant sites? It's pretty much the same as Bitcoin. Just more private.
@_date: 2018-01-09 18:22:42
It is slightly more difficult for developers, but for a merchant there are a couple tools available so it's pretty easy.

But if you want to use Bitcoin as currency *today* your purchasing power fluctuates with the market since most things are still priced using fiat exchange rates

Trolling != skepticism Though you are probably right that it probably wouldn't stay as civil as Monero, a lesser known coin without loads of "infighting".
@_date: 2018-01-15 18:30:41
Monero uses ring signatures as **one** of the technologies to keep transactions private. A mixin of 10 means a ring signature with 11 members. 1 real, 10 decoys.
@_date: 2018-01-10 02:34:46
I went to the site myself and saw that it was no longer an option and thought to myself "well fuck". There was definitely reason to believe that it was dropped, but people probably should have waited for an actual statement from Microsoft before they lost their shit. Of course you are on r/Bitcoin so there is always tinfoil hats and brigading. Do your own research.
@_date: 2018-01-09 22:38:25
There are definitely more little shops here-and-there that accept Bitcoin, but those are rarely used. The point is that they are both only used at select places online along with some other random shops here and there downtown

They would have to at least start using segwit first
@_date: 2018-01-05 17:01:49
I just saw a youtube advertisement for bitcoin. It was made by Blockchain (the company) and was actually pretty informative and didn't even mention their own services (though they did show a 1-2 second clip of their own wallet). I thought it was pretty awesome until they said that you can send transactions across the globe for only a few cents, which use to be true but is now a blatant lie.

People who think like OP are quickly turning Bitcoin from a currency, to a store of value, to soon just a speculative asset.
@_date: 2018-01-07 21:35:30
I decided to look into this myself. A year or two ago I had looked into adding funds to my account with Bitcoin, but decided against it because I didn't need to buy anything from microsoft at the time, but IIRC this was the only way you could ever use Bitcoin with Microsoft. I now googled "Microsoft Bitcoin" (c'mon it's not hard people) and found [this article]( from their support site. It says it was last updated August 2017 (at the bottom). I then followed those steps to try and use Bitcoin to fund my account and the only options present were: Credit/Debit Card, Bank Account, and PayPal. Maybe I did not follow the instructions correctly, but **I do not see Bitcoin as an option**. **Do your own research guys**. Hopefully I just didn't follow the instructions correctly
Edit: add emphasis on **Do your own research**

If you're going to post a donation address, at least make it a segwit address...

What is the difference between accepting through coinbase and "regular" accepting Bitcoin through BitPay?

Now im wondering if there is a tool that supports segwit to make it 3catcafe
@_date: 2017-12-26 01:27:27
The fees are based off the **sending** wallet. If you send from a legacy address, you will have to pay legacy fees. Once you transition to a segwit address, you will be able to benefit from lower segwit fees

Maybe they're not hodlers and just really excited about the revolutionary tech? Probably not... but a man can hope
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:46:21
I would have rather heard about somebody's experience using a *real* wallet, preferably using a segwit address, and seeing how that went instead of Coinbase which is basically an exchange. Anyways, thanks for sharing the experience.
@_date: 2017-12-25 20:19:26
This was my first wallet back in the day. I didn't know they support segwit. I guess I'll be recommending this wallet to noobs from now on.

If you don't have the keys to your coins, they aren't yours. Period.

Literally every time I mention Bitcoin to a group of people at least 1 of them says "its gonna crash soon", but of course these people have no idea how Bitcoin even works...

This is fuckin gold... or should i say BitcoinMoonGold^tm (BMG)?
@_date: 2017-12-26 15:25:46
You would lose like $20 in fees just transferring the BTC, so putting in only $50 probably wont work out

Don't take investment advice from strangers on the internet. Especially on reddit where everyone is here to shill their coin that they have a vested intrest in.

Where the hell did google take you? There was no premine/instamine/ICO/whatever-the-hell. It was fairly launched and us currently being CPU/GPU mined
@_date: 2018-05-21 21:58:15
So what's the situation with fees? I just sent like 10 bucks between segwit addresses for like 4 cents and it got confirmed in 2 minutes...

I was just watching that yesterday. Highly recommend.

Making a Bitcoin faucet isn't new...Is Dogecoin revolutionary now?


That part is very import here


They definitely did. I talked to the guy a little bit. At first he wouldn't even do it until they upped the price (and of course he got death threats after revealing the bug well ahead of time), it was still kinda a rip off for the way he saved their asses.

Electroneum is a fork of Monero, which doesn't share any code with Bitcoin. Electroneum is still a shitcoin though
@_date: 2018-06-12 03:07:56
Monero actually develops stuff, all electroneum did was make a fake mining app after raising millions in the ICO and still left in a critical bug and then royally screwed up the emergency fork so bad that the network halted for hours until they payed somebody else (who now develops a Monero wallet, which is easy to use and helps adoptions) to fix it for them.

If he's wrong, that would make one hell of a porno
@_date: 2018-03-18 05:02:51
I assure you that merchants want fiat. Until a merchant can pay their bills, taxes, suppliers, and employees in BTC they will want fiat. It would be much more practical to convert say ~70% to fiat instantly through a payment processor and say ~30% in Bitcoin.

What was the fee though??

This would be the perfect time for a "**USE BITCOIN**" poster. Imagine a time where none of this data leak shit would have been possible if everyone used Bitcoin.

Who launders money with BTC? If someone really wants to avoid Uncle Sam at the casino they probably are looking for Monero
@_date: 2018-02-28 03:54:55
That's like like 99% true, but I still think the fentanyl thing was a low blow. Obviously fentanyl is bad shit and it's all over the news as "the big bad evil drug" so associating Bitcoin with it makes it sound way worse than it is. Yes, you can buy fent on DNMs, but I would bet the vast majority of Bitcoin/Monero drug purchases are for "soft drugs" like weed, shrooms, molly, DMT, etc which hurt like nobody. Basically, by saying that it's main use is killing people (he did say that cryptocurrency itself is directly responsible) he is using people's fear/hate of fentanyl to make people fear/hate Bitcoin. As other people have pointed out, saying "less than 1% of Bitcoin use is for fentanyl and hence it is evil" would be like saying "less than 1% of Microsoft Windows use is for child porn and hence Bill Gates and Microsoft are evil"
