Wait... but the trailer features E. Voorhes (big block traitor), Roger Ver (big block traitor) and G. Andresen (big block traitor). I don't understand, C. Shrem (who was recently released from jail for doing illegal things directly connected to bcoin) is the only one who understood that small block is better for the future...? Why is he hanging around an ex. con. and why are these people featured in this gem about Bitcoin? Aren't they the enemy?
@_date: 2018-01-01 23:54:01
Was it not a long con? I'm sure the director of the documentary is biased.. Why would he, out of the 4 people 'famous' people, feature 3 traitors? Do you think Amazon, who still doesn't accept bitcoin, is behind all this???

Wait but the CEO of Coinbase is not E. Voorhees nor G. Andresen nor R. Ver.... And the only other one is Shrem who is a convicted felon so is probably never going to become a CEO of anything. I'm confused, why are you suddenly talking about CEOs of BitPay or Coinbase? We weren't talking about them....
@_date: 2018-01-02 00:27:27
Sure.. I'll give it a watch.. But if it turns out the majority of old school bitcoiners was right (bigger blocks were not that bad) and we just listened to the few that were left, well I wouldn't know where to turn!

Did you store them in a faraday cage?

Deterministic brain wallet (the ability to convert 12 words into an HD seed) did not exist. The only way to keep your private keys back then was backing up your wallet.dat file.

It's not a single private key, the funds are not stored under one address. He'd have to have stored hundreds upon hundreds of distinct private keys.

You can easily setup armory offline on tails and store the private key on the encrypted persistent volume. [See more here](

I thought talking about altcoins was against the rules of this subreddit.

I'm not sure Chrome's actual source code is available for review. [Chromium]( is and you can always build your own reviewed version.
If you don't trust google's build of the authenticator you could still get the source code, review it and then compile it and run that build on your phone.

Correct, about the age of the latest post of I guess I had my sort order wrong - I'm not the one who listed those subreddits though, but I'm sure glad they did!
I never said I want those links removed (I have nothing against girls getting paid to show their parts - power to them I guess). I just don't think the first community link on the sidebar of should contain pics of asses... Yeah please think about putting them in a separate list a bit more towards the bottom (no pun intended).
And please "the next request from you or your type would be to remove them all together"... You have no idea who I am, so relax, read better and don't 'recon' anything, OK? :)

It's a very very small market.
Looks likie there is only a couple of buy orders and one sell order.

Valid point, either way.

You are absolutely right. What I meant is the fact that the platform has been open sourced is a good sign: at least they don't rely on obscurity.
@_date: 2012-07-11 21:30:05
You can always setup and run Authenticator offline from an android emulator on a 'secure' computer. It doesn't need to be online at any point.

The whole platform has already been open-sourced for more than a year.

That's one of the defining feature of Armory. You can expect it to never not relie on bitcoin-qt. Why lose time reimplementing Bitcoin-Core and risk introducing new bugs when there is already a very well maintained codebase that does just that? Armory concentrates on the things you couldn't do with Bitcoincore, like wallet seeding or offline transactions. If/when a major security bug will be found in Bitcoin-core you wouldn't have to wait for the BitcoinArmory team to code, build, test and release a new binary of their implementation; you'd be able to install the new bitcoin-core and would be quickly sorted out!

'Recent events' most probably refers to FinCEN.
I dont see anything stating that price of bitcoin has spiked. What are you referring to?
What i meant by whales 'shorting' mtgox is: it could be possible for someone with a lot of btc to fill a lot of buy orders, crash the price and rebuying more bitcoins at a cheaper price at the end of the operation.

You should take a look at this:

The first blocks had only a very few number of transactions. As usage grew, so did the number of transactions per block. It just takes much more time per block because there is much more data per block.
@_date: 2013-04-01 02:29:05
Fair enough. I misunderstood and thought you were saying that they had officialy stated the price of bitcoin had spiked (to its maximal absolute level; that it would never go higher). Off to sleep for me now ;)
@_date: 2013-12-03 00:47:21
They'd cover the risk of fraud with a 'small' fee (probably around the same as right now) and would punish/ban accounts involved in fraud. Could work that way.

I made a rather large order (+1000$) with them last summer. I ordered from Europe in the midst of the summer holidays. Order took more than one month to dispatch, got stuck in customs and came back to them. After a little bit of back and forth with them they gave me ample apologies and a full refund. I then went ahead and ordered a top tier asus laptop and promptly received it. Very happy.
@_date: 2013-05-03 07:37:03
Isn't this perhaps because they cashed out the BTC sometime after the actual sales were made, and luckily had more value than at time of sale?
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:27:05
It would work as long as everybody doesn't ask to withdraw their BTC at the same time.
To have [fractional reserve banking]( based on BTC you'd need the government (or something) to guarantee the ability to lend BTC in case of a bank run. I don't think it's possible with BTC. It would be possible if we used fiat currency, based on BTC.  But that'd mean having to trust the government (or something) to guarantee its value.
