Without being specific I could just say BTC, but in all honesty I have a certain level BTC I am trying to reach through sales, once I reach that amount I will HAVE to convert to fiat to buy inventory, pay bills, etc so right now keeping it 100% BTC isn't possible. 
There is no firearms wholesalers that accept BTC - that I know of.

Woah man, we have a very normal brick and mortar store, a lot of other people sell guys online, we are trying to open up to more business. The no tax thing is not illegal at all, because its an online sale, and you are shipping to another store.
Do you pay tax on anything online? 
If you come to the store you are still required to pay tax. 
Okay, falsify information? No, 72454 is the zip code for my store, if you actually checked out the website you could see that it's not even my website. This is the website of my supplier, anyone who has a perfectly legal gunstore like mine can register with galleryofguns and set up a section for their own store. 
Anyway, thanks for your concern though. 
Edit: you reminded me arkansas state residents do have to pay the tax.

No I am not kidding. I called pay pal before I listed my bitcoin and they
 assured me I was protected to sell Bitcoin on E-bays web site.

I didn't use the best word when I said 'several' how about we just say 2? 
I was specifically referencing this:  
Two year old post where someone was scammed.
