Couldn't your private key be encrypted and stored in some other secure physical location. That way whenever you used your physical wallet (say by scanning it at a store), the scanning device would verify those BTC are yours (maybe add in pin verification) and then complete the transaction. 
Does any of that make sense?

But security...

Sorry for the double post.
If the vendor was trusted though, it would act pretty much like a current credit card system right?
Or it could even be a third party who verifies and decrypts everything instead of the vendor. I'm assuming that's how most banks/credit card companies do their stuff.
Customer/Card(sends encrypted private key)--&gt;Vendor--&gt;POS system--&gt;Authorization 3rd Party (decrypts private key, performs transaction, and verifies,)
Authorization 3rd party(sends back confirmation)--&gt;POS system--&gt;Vendor--&gt;Customer/Card
voila transaction complete

Ok, so this "card" couldn't verify without sending the private key. 
What if no transaction was completed until the user verified it with their private key later? Like, you go home and get a credit card statement. Is that too similar to having a credit card just for BTC?
Also, sorry if my questions are stupid. I'm a bitcoin noob.

Explain yourself.

YES! This is exactly what I was searching for. Is this the only provider of this service?
