That is zoomed out 
@_date: 2018-09-26 17:11:51
Already did!   
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:46:23
Actually my observation is based more in reality than your naive optimism 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:10:27
Good luck with that 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:08:10
You’re missing the forest for the trees

Have fun being perpetually stuck below 7.4 for the foreseeable future.  5k here we come!
Edit:  based on how few people downvoted, I’m guessing there are others who feel similar.  Bitcoin is dying a slow death regardless of how many of you post “to the moon!” 
@_date: 2018-09-19 19:04:57
Look at the movement of the price since it’s peak.  Every high point has been lower than the previous high point, not a good sign.  Unless it is able to beat the trend and gain above 7.3, then it looks like we are just witnessing a very slow death.

It actually is the number associated with the Sun in ancient astrology (planetary Magick squares).  Look it up dweeb 
@_date: 2018-09-26 18:10:44
What reality is that exactly?  The potential reality that may or may not occur?
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:28:47
Maybe! I have no clue what I’m talking about 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:08:16
False equivalencey 
@_date: 2018-08-01 18:14:48
Get ready for 5k 
@_date: 2018-05-24 13:45:00
Sell drunk, buy pizza 
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:58:07
You engaged regardless of my spelling so you point is rendered moot.
@_date: 2018-05-27 13:57:18
The conspiracy unravels! And I would have gotten away with it to if it weren’t for these meddling miners and their coins!

I’m concerned about your sodium intake.  Try drinking more water.
@_date: 2018-06-29 15:04:48
Literally none of you know what you are talking about.  You are all guessing.
@_date: 2018-06-05 14:07:50
Hi. New here, been lurking in the daily discussion thread for a couple months now and I literally just see the same things said over and over and over.  It’s pretty funny actually.
@_date: 2018-06-06 18:50:36
Sure you did 
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:16:11
Are we zoomed out far enough?
@_date: 2018-11-24 19:15:41
Things aren’t looking too good are they lol 
@_date: 2018-12-08 14:47:20
Lol @ every user calling every other user ignorant.  None of you knew what was going on 6 months ago and none of you know what’s going on now. 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:56:43
That’s like comparing Flint Michigan to a desert and saying “well at least they have water” 
@_date: 2018-12-08 22:22:57
...but that gives you an even worse picture.  
@_date: 2018-12-08 15:55:57
You mean one thread I commented on from r/dating_advice ?  
That’s not an actual subreddit ya dingus 
@_date: 2018-12-08 20:47:18
How about now?
