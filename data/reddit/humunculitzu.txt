I don't identify with either side, but the only pro-bitcoin presidential candidate I know of is a Democrat. That being Andrew Yang.

Given he is a Guardian of the Galaxy, and he goes way beyond the moon, saying just the moon might be a little limiting.

I said presidential candidate.

No, obviously it is because up is in all uppercase, underlined and on the bull half of this picture where as down is all uppercase, underlined, and on the bear half. Duh.
@_date: 2018-05-30 16:37:27
I don't think hodlers really watch the market that closely. We scoop up when we can or want to and just sit on it.

So what you are saying is I need to sell just enough for it to jump off so I can sell everything else for a lot more?

You only lose money on crypto if you sell for less than you paid.

As you can see from my super analysis here, bitcoin will definitely go up, down, side ways, backwards, do nothing, or some combination of the 5 potentially at the same time. I can say this with absolutely 100% certainty

You see a crash, I see a good time to buy.
@_date: 2018-06-18 18:59:16
Depending on how you look at it, literally anything could be considered "gambling" to some extent. When you buy basically anything, you are taking a gamble and betting that whatever you are buying will solve whatever problem you bought it to solve and be worth the price you paid for it.

You have no idea how correct you are.

Until it is like 1bil USD/BTC it is down, right?
@_date: 2018-02-26 06:52:03
Lol, I noticed something like that. Not with BTC but I think it was with QTUM I set 2 buy orders. 1, much smaller at a higher price and 1 quite a bit bigger (quite a bit bigger for me at least, not for most though) at the price I actually wanted. It worked out surprisingly well.
@_date: 2018-02-24 06:19:54
Any idea how long they normally last?

In that case as well go balls to the wall crazy and go all in with 10.02

Bullshit, I know exactly what the price will be tomorrow. It will either, up, down, or the same.
