A miner can lower the reward for whatever reasons.
An example would be [block 
Another one is [block  (the coinbase output was 50 BTC, but there were also transaction fees).
Note how some of block explorers process such blocks in a wrong way: [block  on blockchain.info](

I've recently updated the site with the newest altcoins. It shows and uses in calculations only those altcoins which have a market capitalization of more than $100k. Any suggestions are welcome!

I think it's easier for them just to configure The Great Firewall of China in a way so it would block all connections from the outside world for a day, or even for a couple of hours. That would be a mess for Bitcoin, because all the blocks mined by "the outside world" will be orphaned and all the transactions included in these blocks will be reverted. Such a mess can severely damage Bitcoin.

No, it didn’t. Stop spreading lies.

Why do you think this is the case? ��

Examples for the most significant alts:
* Ripple - 
* Litecoin - 
* BitShares - 
* Dogecoin - 
* NXT - 
The analytics are available for more than 200 altcoins.
You can choose an altcoin in the drop-down menu by clicking on the title of the altcoins graph (sorted descending by capitalization, it also has a search field). Additionally, there is a list of altcoins in alphabetical at the bottom of the page.

Of course it has. You can’t make “standard” transactions only, sometimes you’ll have one input, sometimes two, three, etc. Other times you’ll be withdrawing bitcoins from an exchange in a transaction with 10 outputs, and so on.
Either way, “fee per kilobyte” has also increased by the same magnitude.
Date — Median fee per kilobyte — Average fee per kilobyte  
2017-01-01 — $0.66425 — $0.77085  
2017-02-28 — $1.73755 — $1.90272

This block was mined by Antpool, they have set the soft limits to 935 and 750k: 


@_date: 2017-03-05 17:21:37
The average fee per byte is growing with the same speed.
@_date: 2017-03-05 19:09:50
You know what ‘median’ means, don’t you?
@_date: 2016-03-01 12:06:11


@_date: 2017-03-06 07:03:25
Yep, but you can find median values on the chart :)
@_date: 2017-03-05 17:18:48
Look at the chart, there are median values as well as average.

The first two spikes in price (May 2011 and March 2013) are almost invisible because of the scale. The pre-2014 era actually looks more clear on a log scale.

The same graph on a log scale:

That’s the catch — you can’t distinguish bugs from valid code without human intervention :)
And that’s right, there’s always been the 21M limit of newly minted coins in coinbase outputs. But before that bugfix everyone could create any amount of bitcoins out of thin air and that would be a valid transaction.
Was it a bug? Or a feature? From the “code is law” approach that was a feature :)

Thanks! It uses two different databases for different purposes. I’ll be working on the About page in the near future, so I’ll try to include some technical details in there.
@_date: 2017-01-24 02:29:51
I get your point, but how can you be sure that an overflow wasn’t the desired behavior?
@_date: 2017-01-18 18:51:54
51% is the theoretical lower bound, while in practice no one is going to hard fork at 51%. That’s why there’s an asterisk on the chart.

Originally I was going to publish such a chart, but this takes time, so maybe tomorrow.
But you are right, there’s a spike:

Yes, right now the wiki covers only the Bitcoin Core developers, but I hope that in the near future we'll cover the largest mining pools, developers of alternative proposals to Core, and many other persons and projects. 
@_date: 2016-02-02 14:13:09
Yep, you can submit articles about any companies or projects in the cryptocurrency sphere (well, if it's not something like a HYIP, of course). So it would be great to see an article about BitHope :)

The easiest way to do this is to use developer tools in your browser — you can see the list of loaded resources there. The other option is to use a plugin like Ghostery — not only it shows the list of analytics services and spy bugs, but also blocks them (not all of them unfortunately).
@_date: 2019-01-21 18:00:32
Most of the points are easily verifiable (no cookies, referrer policy, no use of analytics, no use of CDN providers). Anyways, it’s always a good idea to use Tor when browsing crypto-related websites.

Try  it’s possible to filter by balance there.
Currently there’s no software allowing to do that without relying on 3rd party APIs.

Well, it’s a question of terminology. In my view, hard forks split the chain into a «majority chain» and a «minority chain» whilst soft forks must not do this (by requiring the majority of the hashing power).
And, I believe, this property (not splitting the chain) is superior to the property you described (strengthening rules). Thus, «soft» forks without a proper voting mechanism (e.g. without the mechanism at all like in v.0.3.1, or mechanisms requiring 25% of the hashing power for activation) become «hard» because they potentially create two chains (or «unqualified», fair enough, once again, it’s all about terminology, and it’s endlessly debatable :)
@_date: 2016-10-15 12:58:33
The 1 Mb block size limit was introduced in 2010 (v.0.3.1) and technically it was a hard fork.
@_date: 2017-05-02 05:26:00
That’s exactly what the original chart shows.

@_date: 2016-10-15 15:33:42
I disagree. While lowering the limit could be indeed a soft fork, doing so without a proper voting mechanism will lead to a chain split if the majority of miners won’t follow the new rules. If Core maintainers decided to simply change the MAX_BLOCK_SIZE constant value to 500.000 in let’s say, 0.13.2 release, without using the mechanism described in BIP 9 (and this mechanism didn’t exist in 2010), that may lead to two different Bitcoins. I don’t think that falls into the definition of a soft fork.
@_date: 2017-05-02 08:56:38
Yep, it’s in there:

Maybe I don't understand something, but:
1) Mr. Maxwell writes this:


Then this:


How can you possibly implement that without "numbers"? "If miner wants to create block M% bigger, he needs to pay N bitcoins". Who decides on M and N? Isn't that "specific limits"?
2) Miners who decide to raise the cap will have two options:
a. Just raise the block size limit
b. Pay N bitcoins for M% increase each time
Why on Earth they would choose to pay instead of simply increasing the cap?
It seems that it's just another so-called "solution" (like BIP102, etc.) proposed just for stalling the real increase.
