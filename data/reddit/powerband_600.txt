Is the general consensus that BFL is a scam?

I was doing a bit of digging recently and came across this. They may well be legitimate: 
Still skeptical of course, but who knows.

Oh I realize, but I do want to be around BTC for a while, and I'd be interested to see what the network looked like in 2-5 months. And who would be a good, reliable alternative to MtGox if I was looking to get in, say, today?

Close to 2k USD (who knows what that buys in a few hours) certainly not a significant investment (I'm no Warren Buffet) but its what I could afford to lose should it all go pear shaped.

Hahaha, didn't even notice, good point though. Like I said, still skeptical. The article also states they aren't performing at the original spec, so who knows.

I'm looking long term. I like the concept of BTC and am interested in riding it out, regardless of what happens in this current runup.

That sounds pretty solid to me, I was leaning towards buying some (about half of my available USD) now and holding on whilst I wait to hear more about whether the ASIC vendors are actually shipping. I definitely am interested in the long term with BTC though, I find the whole concept of the currency fascinating and love learning about it, so I want to stick with it for quite a bit.
