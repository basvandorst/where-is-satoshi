This is what frustrates me most about DPR's huge screwup. I'm just some 20 year old who enjoys smoking pot - certainly not next-in-line for starting a drug empire - and yet, if the relevant [transcript]( of his conversation with Redandwhte is to be believed, he made dumb arrogant mistakes that I think even I would have known to avoid.
For starters, why was this even carried out on the DPR account? I understand that the initial blackmail from Friendlychemist was sent directly to DPR, but by actually *ordering the hit* using that account, he instantly lost his ability to make any plausible claim that it wasn't him in the event that the servers did get seized and the messages read.
Secondly (this is the part that relates to your post, fattyforhire), DPR made the first move in asking for the hit. He clearly tried "subtlety" with his "I wouldn't mind if he was executed", but all it took was *one* additionak message from Redandwhite before DPR lost his patience/nerve and just straight-up put a bounty on his head.
How dumb do you have to be to ask somebody - about whom you know literally nothing except for the fact they deal drugs - to kill someone they know personally at your behest? DPR didn't even try to hide the fact he was a novice to hiring hitmen (in fact, even the $80k hit he quoted has since been shown to have been a fake 'killing' by an undercover agent) and yet he took basically no precautions with regard to asking for the hit.
Honestly, I think he'd be in so much less shit (still a lot of shit, but *much* less) if he'd just created a new account and sent the same message to Redandwhite. But knowing DPR, he'd probably have called the account "altoid". Sigh.
