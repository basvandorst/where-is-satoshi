Damn coinbase.

Markets more often than not, run in years, not months or weeks. You either HODL or learn to scalp. Both are not for the faint hearted.

Take car. Go to mum's. Kill Phil. Grab Liz, go to the Winchester, have a nice cold pint, and wait for all of this to blow over.

It’s hard not to be cliché.

This could be used in copious scenarios.

Paper notes are completely 100% clean and take up no energy whatsoever. The machines that make them run on happiness.

“Don’t require energy” - laughable quote. 
What are ATMs made out of? Metal
What are cash registers made out of? Metal
What are vaults made out of? Metal 
Notes are made out of... paper
How do they get the paper? Deforestation. -which includes the use of machines, which are made out of metal. 
How is the money cleaned when it gets to the banks? In a machine. Also made out of metal. Also fuelled by happiness. 
How do you make all of these metal objects? With another machine i.e a cast. Which is made out of metal. Oh yes and with people either designing, maintaining and operating. 
Do I really have to mention the ink? 
To do all of these things, you have to use a fuel type e.g. diesel, petrol, oil, coal
I could really go on all day listing things but I don’t want waste any more energy. 
I just want to finish off by saying you really need to stop getting drawn in by one statistic without considering other variables. You and others like yourself need to get off your high horse and take a look at the bigger picture. That is very big problem with people these days. OPEN YOUR EYES, THE FUTURE IS HERE.

We’re still pretty much at ground zero. Banks and fiat are still dominant in society, but as the days go on, more and more people become wise to cryptocurrencies, it’s all a matter of patience in terms of bitcoin to become the go-to global currency. 
One bitcoin ATM at a time my friend. 
*EDIT* - Be happy in the fact you have knowledge and investment this early on. There will people people raging over the fact they didn’t jump on the train when you have. 
Also Bitcoin will never have the anonymity you speak of, you should take a look at some privacy coins.

Sounds to me like you have missed the last bull run and have joined the market in it’s ‘depression’ stage. There is light at the end of the tunnel though, markets will recover and you will be feeling less worried when you start seeing gains. 
And no, it is not easy unfortunately. Even the greatest day traders have their bad days.

If you love bitcoin, you wouldn’t be concerned with the price at all other than the fact that the masses will see it as more desirable. True lovers fight for the tech. 
@_date: 2018-06-23 08:33:24
There are so many variables to consider and speculate. IMO, it’s been 10 years since the last massive financial meltdown and it going to take something like that for the masses to turn to btc.

That’s a very popular get out of jail response. Obviously there is no way to prove that god doesn’t exist, however, can you prove to me today that he does exist without using a book that was written thousands of years ago? I don’t think so. 
And before you say he came to you in a dream, I’d like to trump your ‘god’ with the Cookie Monster whom appeared in my dream. You want to know what he said? He said told me there was no god. Only the THE COOKIE MONSTER!

Ahhh the good old cheat sheet. Will never be outdated.

Does anyone have a stat for how many ICO’s fail?

Here you go, have some karma.

Everyone used to think the world was flat.

CFDs aka biggest piece o’ crap around. Nonetheless, people who are not crypto savvy will simply see ‘bitcoin’. The subliminal work continues.

The price isn’t dependant on whatever Johnny decides to write in his article.

Contacting apple seems your best bet.

A go-to website would be crucial, almost like Trip advisor, so someone living in/visiting a place could see a list of places in that offer lightning payment.
Any web designers.. get on it ;)
