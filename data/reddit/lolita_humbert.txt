I think patriarchy and these stereotypes are hurtful for both men and women, but more for women. Would you like to convince me otherwise? I'm totally up for debate.
I'm sorry if I seemed sexist :/ I'm a man myself, and I just consider women's issues to be more important. That is not to say I don't care for men's issues, or that I hate men. I'm so sorry :/

What stereotypes were enforced by the woman? How did she oppress people?

I god damn hope this wasn't the big burst... lots of people's savings were transferred to bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:22:12
Very stupid, I have to say. Still feel sorry for them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 18:29:15
Ah, the good ol' "nerds are whores" sterotype.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:48:04
Ah, okay. Now I wish I would've waited a couple of hours till I bought.

Of course it's not good that she made that joke, not saying so. She's an asshole and unfunny, but retaliating with a joke as stupid makes you worse.

I'm a dude, so no thanks.
@_date: 2013-04-10 19:23:33
I guess I didn't consider that, true. Tunnel-vision happens to me quite often, so I guess you're right.

Was just looking for a quick answer, sorry for spamming this subreddit.

I don't care how it makes me look, I want people to think for a second about stuff. People on reddit seem to think that complaining about or drawing any attention to *anything* that doesn't regard white atheist middle-class American men is just whining. It's a double standard I'd like to get rid of, and I'm doing it comment by comment.

Being a prostitute is nothing bad, and I fully support it being legalized. What women or men do with their bodies is their own decision.
But what is bad, is calling people whores. Whore has a negative load, there is no doubt about that. Also, calling people whores for liking sex, having a lot of it, or using revealing clothes is bad. Call people prostitutes only if they are such, and don't attach a negative image to it.
Women are oppressed through media, advertisements, jokes, and the cultural hivemind. Go see ten movies and you are bound to see a stupid blond woman, a pair of boobs, a ["manic pixie dream girl"]( a woman who only gets better once they get a man, a crazy woman, etc. Women are objectified, sexualized, and generalized negatively. You could watch some of (reddit hates her but she's actually pretty okay) Anita Sarkeesian's Feminist Frequency videos.

Yes, it is. Also, she did not enforce any stereotypes or try to subjugate oppressed people, unlike the guy who replied.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:52:33
I didn't say the joke made by the woman was right, did I? Calling people whores is bad, whoever's being called it.
Also, subjugating and oppressing already oppressed groups of people who have defined stereotypes formed around them, and enforcing those stereotypes *is* worse than doing that to white middle-class men.
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:36:27
Yes, they should be. Thanks to the no-image-macros/memes rule in the subreddit is much better.

It's been over two hours.
@_date: 2013-04-10 17:19:43
What are we supposed to do, then? Just keep writing academic articles and complain on our own forums? Is all discourse outside of our own community banned?
@_date: 2013-04-10 20:01:05
No. The market is right now less stable than ever.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:53:40
Calm your moobs.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:46:43
I don't post there, but I think this post is absolutely sexist, no denying it. Should be deleted.
Also, jokes don't live in vacuums. They create pictures of people and aspects off culture. So jokes are not "just" jokes, and therefore I can complain about them.
@_date: 2013-04-10 16:51:59
It's not that they're offensive, it's that they're harmful. This particular instance is implying that the woman here is a prostitute, and in its wake it also leaves a picture of not just the woman in question but of all women. It uses the image of women as inherently sexual and "man-wanting" beings, and thus enforces it.
