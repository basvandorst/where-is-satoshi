Is there anything Bitcoin can do to avoid the problem of block size having an effect on orphaning and solve the problem is talking about?

disagree on the PoW. you are comparing two separate algos both of which are now asic only. the total amount of global hash is limited to the available specialist hardware.

Miners have to validate the block before the build on top of it, they can only do this by downloading the block first.

I guess it doesnt matter since they no longer sell consumer machines. They just mine for themselves.
@_date: 2015-06-05 18:49:38
You are wrong. Headers first do not help miners, they have to validate the transactions of every announced block before they can start to build their block on top of that. So they need to wait for the block to be downloaded.

War is always good for certain (big) business. It's never good for the masses. When things collapse, wealth is redistributed and the top get richer. So no, it's not a good thing. Neither is saying things improve after the war - because that's a no brainer: Once you burn everything to the ground, growth is the only possible outcome: so do we fix the economy by bombing everything flat? don't answer that, since they probably do sadly :(.

Pending their closure... that they have admitted this publicly rather than try to fix it quietly (which they obviously cant or they would have done so already), is a pretty clear indication Gox is going down.
How they will close down I dont know since they say they cant transfer money out... I got out **months** ago. I told people to do so, and now you cant even xfer BTC. Before it took days, now you may never see your money again. They've obviously run out of coins - which should never happen on an exchange because they take fees and should always have a surplus of fiat and coins.

No, the inputs cannot be mutated because they are what is recorded in the blockchain as being spendable in the first place.
When your software sends the payment, you have a record of the payment + the txid. That is fine. What goes wrong is if someone takes that payment broadcast and rebroadcasts it with a mutated signature (i.e. the same valid sig but with padding). They get a different txid - if that is confirmed, then those inputs get spent. If they claim they never got the money you would look at your txid and see it's not confirmed. That is why you record your txid and the broadcasted payment details. To verify if their claim of non payment is correct, you can look up YOUR copy of what YOU broadcast and check the inputs. Hell, you could even rebroadcast your transaction - because it has the same inputs. If those have been spent already it wont confirm. What you DO NOT do is make a new transaction with new inputs.

@_date: 2014-03-11 17:49:05
I have news for you. The first person that broadcasts the tx spending your inputs will win and the rest wont even relay, let alone be picked up by a miner (since the first tx will be broadcast to the entire network in a second and stay in the mempool, thus no-one will relay a double spend). And for 0.01BTC I wouldn't expect lots of people to be trying simultaneously that might have a chance at propagating a competing tx because they start simultaneously from other sides of the planet.

BUT, there are a ton of people who don't hang out in Reddit etc who would never have necessarily gotten the news, and a ton of new people who joined MtGox recently and may not even have known about any issues.

Right, and unlike previously where extorting money required some measure of risk (since physical money needs to be collected buy the criminal), it's possible to ransom, get paid, drop person off at random location. At no point does the attacker risk contact with the police except at the time of the kidnap. This is a really big risk and not to be poopooed.

Gox generate the txs, store in the DB and broadcast them. Their API is not picking up on txs from the blockchain, these are records of txs generated before they are broadcast so their back end can then tract the txs. That is why there is the ntxid fyi.
If someone got hold of gox's private keys, they'd simply have spent the money, but it woult not be showing up on the MtGox API stream.

BTCe are not anonymous. They are to you, but not to the police. They have many financial links that will require AML/KYC so frankly, if they do something, they will be found. And I am sure the US know who they are already.

I thought side-chains are mined, but there is no block reward, only transaction fees. What am I missing? This leads to a pegged currency much like Mastercoin was attempting, but it's still an alt-chain, and it's still (merged)mined, just the incentives are different.
A side chain could also be used to store data from the main chain, but again, it's still a mined chain - afaik, there is no way to keep the security benefits of a distributed decentralized database without a proof of work aka mining process.

Longer term maybe, but remember BTC is new, and there is very little economy and ecosystem involving it. Price history is short unlike gold. Short term, if things escalate I bet heavily downwards - bearing in mind, Bitcoin is very much in a bearish downtrend since the announcement of China (look at the 1D timeline at bitcoin wisdom  MtGox only accelerated the downward motion.
What I am very sure of is this: if we get bad news from NATO meetings and this escalates more, there will be blood on the markets, as well as the streets.
@_date: 2014-03-22 20:25:23
Trend change in a few months does not mean new ATH in a few months and I never said that. 3-6 months later is when Wall Street gets involved. We will definitely see the market go sideways and then begin a bullish trend but not for a few months at least, maybe as long as 6 months at a guess. When the next ATH comes I don't know, but the trend will change - this is the year of adoption and for the more mature markets getting into Bitcoin. It's also the year when regulations in the US will be cemented and begin to give certainty. eBay and Paypal will never accept bitcoin until there is clear regulatory certainty. 
I expect to see the low 400's again and then sideways. If it fails 400 test then we'll need to reassess, but all indications so far show 400 as the bottom. Overall, Bitcoin's long term future is very bright but for now most of my trades are short.

No. Front running is trading ahead of news so that you get an unfair advantage. Front running in the real world happens around 10-50ms before news is released, because HFT is used. Here there is no HFT and a significant selloff started just before the news was released. That my friend, is front running... and it must have been done by someone at Gox, surely Gox themselves. No-one else knew the content of the report.

@_date: 2014-03-20 21:37:30
All the good news is setting the stage. Unless it's something pretty earth shattering like Paypal or eBay then dont expect market trends to even blink. Wall Street get involved 3-6 month from now, the game will change. But we're still a long way off really. Regulations need to come in the US since Paypal/eBay wont touch it until there is regulatory clarity.
It will come, and when the trend change comes, it's going to be mind blowing, but it's going to take a while also for the market to recover from the shocks it's been put through since December. Patience, but in my opinion, buying between 400-550 is going to be a good long term bet. If some really bad news hits, expect prices to go down more.
This is my opinion of course, and I've been saying the same since 850 a few months back.
That's the last point about a bear market - bad news has a strong effect. good news does not have much effect.
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:59:51
How do you explain the timing of the dump before the release of the news? This has all the hallmarks of front running which you can't 'prove'. That's the point, that is how front running works in every other circumstance. But it's obvious every time it happens, but rarely results in prosecution.

Worse, he claims double spending is traceable because you'd need to sell into USD. Gavin obviously knows an attacker would buy into an altcoin and perform the double spend that way.
1. send BTC to exchange
2. buy altcoin and xfer out immediately
3. cancel 1 with a double spend.
You now have your original BTC and the altcoin.

but not without centralization (including centralized trust) and friction. that is what bitcoin brings to the table. it's completely frictionless and has value in and of itself just like gold. nothing backs gold, nothing backs bitcoin, so their value is accepted in and of themselves. bitcoins can be teleported, gold cannot, and even with financial instruments (IOUs etc) it still will not put gold into everyone's pockets: unlike bitcoin.  I get you "in theory" but frankly, it's not gonna happen, and that is why bitcoin's value can exceed gold's.

I wouldn't call it a bubble, just highly overbought and going to correct sooner or later. But selling at $1000+ was wise because you have to ask yourself the question, "if I cash out now and the price continues to go up, will we see $1000 again?". You can see, even if you'd sold at $400 you'd still have had the rebuy option. The problem with the "to the moon" crowd is they think once the price goes up, they will never be able to buy again at that price. Even people at BTCe managed to buy at $102 recently after a massive margin-call cascade. And you can quote me on this, expect to see $400 **again** in the not too distant future.
Just to finish up, the wise sold out at ~$1000, took out their original investment money + some profit, and then rebuy MORE bitcoins with the remainer. The even wiser would have taken some of the profits and bought silver and gold. Next time, do the same ;)

Hardly the point. Legally required to, as opposed to what's right are not the same thing. The Nazis actions were legal under their laws - didn't make it right. 
MtGox owes the bitcoin community the truth and transparency and they gave been anything but this. There recent statements were the result of things getting SO unmanageable that they were compelled to do something because otherwise they risked complete collapse. That's the truth.
Bitcoin is exactly about transparency. That is what the blockchain is - full disclosure. Systems that will develop consequently with zero knowledge proofs etc. allow trust with privacy, but it's still completely transparent.
Gox are self serving, arrogant and secretive. It took Mark Karpeles *days* to even show up on the github ticket regarding this these issues. 
So please, take your legal this and legal that and go shove it - MtGox needs to do the right thing, not hide behind smokescreens.

I can tell you are no programmer and have no real understanding and are hell bent on wining at any cost. So be it, but you really shouldn't embarrass yourself like this. I mean, defending Java as something secure is just plain ridiculous - they can't even manage to patch the 0days faster than they are discovered.
Face facts, PHP might not be the best designed language (to understate), it runs about 80% of the internet (

People gonna hate. Peter is disruptive to the status quo because he is willing to challenge and push boundaries. Commit history does not define your status as a core developer. That fact is, he is influential to development of the core: through peer review, case testing and security. It's not all about just committing code. Mike Hearn is a good example of that too.
Amir Taaki is yet another, someone who Gavin has shown great distaste towards, yet is an innovator and massive contributor to the bitcoin space.
When reading between the lines understand Peter is dubbed the chief nay-sayer and is often the one to expose shortcomings in others proposals - things people might have though about for a long time and invested a lot of time into, ripped into shreds because he sees another angle no-one considered.
Mike is another personality who there is a lot of negative rhetoric against. Sadly, the bitcoin core developer community is like that.
Gavin has shown himself to someone who is very status quoist and easily manipulated by government. I think it's well meaning, but he's in a bubble and some of his recent proposals to bitcoin core leave one scratching the head.
You should read this rather damming report  because it sheds some interesting insight into the world you are investigating.
One thing is clear, Peter is radical, visionary and very capable. Watch some of his talks and read some of his papers. 
It's quite possible there is a lot of jealousy surrounding him, but look at his history, he has a tendency to be right, even if over cautious because he really has a passion for this space.
My own opinion is the Bitcoin core developers have their head in the sand regarding certain issues. Just like everyone was all "51% can never happen" and yet one pool got itself in a position to do just that. They didnt, but the point of Bitcoin is that you shouldnt need to trust, it's supposed to be trustless.
Treechains is an honest attempt at solving mining centralization and anyone who claims it's not a problem is drunk on the koolaid.

No, he's mixing up the argument. I bring you back to the point in hand. I asked for gox employees to spill the beans. You people come up with all sorts of irrelevant nonesense as to why that cant happen. The only valid point made is **if the employees signed an NDA** it might get an employee sacked or liable to a civil case (if they are discovered and they can easily do things anonymously). Getting sacked from a bankrupt company is probably not so bad, nor can they afford to file frivolous court cases I am sure. Nothing else said is relevant. Enough already.

The thing with "out of band" is you still have to broadcast the tx otherwise you cannot be sure of ownership. If you and I agree a trade out of band and off the block chain, maybe I just hand over a private key to you. Problem is you dont know if I still have a copy of that key. I might just sign away the funds after you step on the plane. Really, until transfer happens on the blockchain, nothing is safe.

The API simply shows what MtGox have processed using their software, that's it. But given Gox said they only had 2000BTC, now we know that was a lie. They have been processing 180,000BTC through their own software and this is the output broadcast to the blockchain. There is nothing to assume the funds were disbursed to customers, or that they will refund customers....
I would also like to pull you up on "internal addresses". There are no such thing. All addresses are hashes of public keys, and all transactions are on the blockchain. WHO controls the private keys is probably what you mean. No-one has suggested funds were sent to customers.

Actually, hating PHP is not really justified in and of itself. The problem lies in that PHP is a language that allows idiots to slap together things that work without any real understanding of proper software design. A good programmer can write very elegant PHP code, but they have to be well trained. Look at Symfony2 or Doctrine as an example of what PHP can be achieved elegantly. Drupal or is an example of very inelegant hackathon code that is buggy and insecure.
PHP clearly can scale well because Facebook use it, albeit with a compiler, but none the less, PHP runs most of the web, and includes very high profiles sites.

When you pay, you just sign a message and broadcast it. If it doesnt meet basic requirements, there is no obligation for nodes to relay that, and thus your message would not be heard by any other nodes and not any miners (who would write it into the ledger after verification). Miners may not pick up a transaction in a timely fashion or at all, if there is no fee. At the moment, no fee can work, because miners get much rewards from mining anyway.
Just pay the damn fee and you wont get any hassle.

@_date: 2014-03-08 17:57:19
Wrong. The 180,000 BTC absolutely is controlled by MtGox. Who else has access to their systems in order to process transactions.
We also have seen the code which takes cold wallets and disburses them into multiple addresses for processing by hotwallets later. The way and rate in which the 180,000 was split matches the code.
There is no credible reason to believe funds have been given to any customers, or transferred outside of MtGox control, and in fact given the above, it's quite safe to assume they are well in control of MtGox.
We have no idea about the intentions, right. But we can be completely sure those coins belong to MtGox and are under their control.
@_date: 2014-08-01 09:17:12
It is absolutely controlled by the BF by proxy. Don't pull the wool over people's eyes with technicalities.
Also you are wrong about the concept of core developers. There are people who can merge other's code who has direct push access, but that doesnt make them a core developer, it makes them a "maintainer". It's part of any good QA process. In fact you will notice even maintainers mostly dont merge their own commits, they let another maintainer do it after it goes through the same group discussion and vetting process as everyone else's.

Because there is space allocated for no fee transactions in blocks, and first relayed to will fill the mempool of all nodes anyway making it impossible to broadcast a double spend even if it has a fee attached. That is why an attack would require simultaneous tx from separate networks, preferable at different ends of the planet. It is basically not so easy. And for high value, like buying a house you would wait for confirmations anyway.

In any regulated market where it is prohibited yes IANAL :) 
This is what people often don't understand about Bitcoin. You often hear people say things like Bitcoin is unregulated and use that as an excuse to almost justify thefts and so on, not realising that normal crime is crime regardless of the context. But in the case of regulated markets, there are rules and prohibitions specifically for whatever they regulate. Take the US laws on money transmission as a good example, without the rules, the activity classed as money transmission would not ever be deemed as illegal... but you can go to prison for not complying.

You are now mixing up two things. The malleability issue yes, the spamming of transactions yes - none of that is in question (you dont need to reexplain the tech I understand all that already), but you are asserting that MtGox has fallen over because suddenly none of their staff could identify transactions because there has been mass spamming. Not true.
The mass spamming started AFTER gox's statements (as has been proved). What was happening before then was an exploit by a few in order to commit fraud and was going on for months. Gox has been bleeding bitcoins for months.... as early as November for BTC withdrawals actually...

@_date: 2014-02-09 22:51:56
They are simply verifying and settling transactions and then writing that in the blockchain log. The "sums" are just a Proof Of Work method which prevents forgery and allows decentralized, trustless consensus. Ignore the popular explanations, it's just as simple as that. The rules set by bitcoin all a miner to issue currency to themselves when they solve a block in the blockchain. Everyone else agrees because those are the rules set in the software.
The Proof Of Work is simply a hash of the (block+nonce) which produces a long (hex) number. The number needs to be less than a given target number. If the resulting hash (number) it too big, you increase the nonce and redo the hash (over and over) until you get a result which is less than the target. This proves you did the work. it's easy for others on the network to verify since you publish the block + hash + nonce. To verify you just do hash(block+nonce) and test the resulting number is less than the block target: i.e. to do the work takes a lot of repetition, but verification can be done instantly.

My point exactly. I have sent wires for thousands regularly and never had any problems. They ask for KYC the first time and they credit your account the day following you send the wire, so if I wire on Monday, the money arrives Tuesday. Every time.
IMO the only problem BTC-e might get is if the USA tried to take them down on some bogus charges. But that is why, BTC-e (which is now the No2 exchange, and actually No1 if you include their entire BTC volume over all their trading pairs) has banned US citizens and any payments from the US banking system. And even after that, they are still basically No1 or 2... tells you something huh?

I dont know what you are trying to imply, or maybe you just want to keep some false hope of MtGox surviving. It's over, very much over. Whatever people had is gone, and Mark will go to jail. That much, is obvious. I am sorry for yours and everyone else's loss.

No, because ntxid is not generated by the network. They were generating payments and tracking them using their txid. They changed the API to generate ntxid so they could track the payment even if someone rebroadcast the transaction with a padded signature which would alter the txid. We know gox was not tracking addresses because core devs were in communication with Mark and talked about their processes.

I fee sorry for you man... but if they turn withdrawals back buy BTC and leave pronto. Been telling people about this impending issue for months.

Well stuck has been used by MtGox and the community to mean, I withdrew my money, it's showing in my account as withdrawn, but not appeared in the blockchain yet.
Stuck implies blocked movement, as in tried to move, but cant because of an impediment inhibiting. But what we see here is not blocked movement, it's funds being moved about freely. Gox has a chunk of investors money, but they havent owned up to this, announced it, nor made efforts to pay people back, even a small percentage of their debt.

There is space. They are considered valid txs for relay. But in the future if there are more txs competing for inclusion into a block, there will be more competition for free txs and more delays.

The MtGox exchange used to dictate trading trends. If you were trading elsewhere, you could be sure that if something started to happen at Gox, it would spread to the other exchanges. Not so now. In fact, Gox is so dead, sometimes it doesnt even respond to huge movements on other exchanges (like Stamp and BTCe).
Taken on the world stage, Gox is WAY less than 3rd position. Bitfinex is higher than Gox, they account for 25% of Bitstamp's daily volume + they have their own - they are easily 4th by BTC/USD volume. Then you have the Chinese exchanges, even adjusted for their apparent tampering of the figures, Gox figures way down the list. Sure they have the odd time when there is a bit of volume, but by in large, people have moved away. Gox price also reflects the inability of arbitrage across the exchange and we know that not only is USD illiquid, but Bitcoin too! Which is frightening.
Slightly off topic, but the most surprising thing of all is the first place goes to BTCe despite it's awful trollbox. Now in terms of USD trade, it's oscillates between Bitstamp and BTCe, but actually, in terms of BTC traded, BTCe is the top exchange (across all pairs).
Anyway, stay away from MtGox, they are incompetent, and their corpse is beginning to smell rotten, even to the many Gox apologists. I believe Gox probably lives of new people due to their prominent position on bitcoin.org and high price (which is basically not real, but n00bs dont know that.).
@_date: 2014-06-12 18:10:35
Actually when Bitfinex adopted the maker / taker fee structure they removed the 100BTC minimum for hidden orders. Now you just pay the taker fee for hidden orders of any size. That was months ago.
KYC/AML is strict on Bitfinex. If you deposit or withdraw USD, the first time you must supply ID and proof of address just as with any bank. But you do it once, and that suffices and they dont ask over and over.

Here is another facthe reported corroborated from external sources 
@_date: 2014-01-03 23:40:01
Surely if you sell your bitcoins and buy them back then you are back in the investment? I mean if you bought at $100, sold at $1100, then the price dropped and you bough $1100 worth at $500, what is situation there? No dollars are left over. Simple capital gains rules surely? e.g. the same as if you'd dealt in stock and shares.

@_date: 2014-02-13 11:41:19
Interesting assertion, but someone has been looking at the blockchain and running stats over at bitcointalk and the number of malled (sic) transaction has only recently become common (since Gox's announcement). Therefore it's a stretch to assume they couldnt find the UXTO's any more. I am sure they noticed this and lead to a "oh fuck" moment, but as has been pointed out by many (including myself), withdrawal issues have been going on for months so someone could have been exploiting this for quite a while.
for the record, I dont want people to lose their money... but I am not trading on any positive assumptions personally.

Sorry, but that is petty. I agree php is horrible for many reasons, but you can hate most languages for their quirks. PHPs weakness is enabling unskilled and untrained programmers to make things easily. Used right, PHP can be just as valid a choice, and some different languages suite different purposes.
Proper training is the key.

Bitcoins probably not. If they were stolen, wave good bye. But the the Japanese Police are now involved, so is their FSA and it looks like US authorities have issued subpoenas also. 
And fresh news from two-bit suggests that there might actually be a bigger conspiracy-to-defraud from big name players in the bitcoin space.

I might remind you it is ILLEGAL for a convicted felon still on probation to start a company. Funny how this company is running another long con, just like before?
Go research how long cons are done - they tick all the boxes.
They are committing massive fraud because they are using deception all the way to get money from people. Fraud is theft. End of. 
If you don't want to believe please su because you are endangering other people from losing their money.
There is nothing BFL sell that will make it's money back by the way. Not a single product - and why, because they offer products like the 600GH/s miner that look like they would be profitable now, but because (they know they will deliver late) you will never see your money back. That's pure evil.
And by the way, they also were doing under the table sales of mini rigs when they were not supposed to be available. As in, turn up at the door with $100k and you get a mini rig. 
And let's not forget the mining they have been doing on people's equipment when they should have been sending them out. So mining while the difficulty is profitable and then shipping them out when it's not. That is more theft.
They are clever crooks.  Stupid crooks get caught immediately. But theft can be executed in very convoluted ways which make it much harder to point the finger. But they ARE stealing. They are lying, and they are engaged in a long con scam.
I've said my piece and will not respond further to your pedantics.

Not really sure what he's talking about. As someone who follows the code changes at github, there is a pretty decent amount of activity.... and on the list, a pretty large amount of innovation protocol wise.
Remember not all dev happens in the code base, there are also BIPS and these are non-trivial involving a lot of maths and can be very hard to understand.
So called HD wallets, stealth addresses  and CoinJoin are three pretty notable advances, not to mention a LOT of work on the reference implementation.
Sorry, but he's just not right here...

I think it means they think there is something worth sniffing about MtGox because they don't investigate things unless they have some suspicion of being able to gain intelligence. I am sure MtGox was a great honeypot before, but now maybe they can nail them too. MtGox was used by SR and for SR transactions remember... there is a lot more to this than meets the eye, IMO.

Hong Kong is an economic freedom zone. They don't even use RMB in Hong Kong so it's a whole different set of rules there as far as I am aware.
Obviously there is a huge difference placing a hidden order at 0.2% fee and the maker fee you pay if you place a non-hidden order. So it's still expensive and discouraging I guess. Hidden orders dont even make sense for small quantity IMO.
@_date: 2014-01-10 10:03:23
Spot on. They give customers the ability to configure where their hashing goes - but that means their sys-admins can change it since they have access to everything.... but remember, CEX.IO does't have that full 38% of the hash power, it's split between their own equipment and those who have miners outside of their facility and are just using the ghash.io pool so the issue is significantly less problematic.

I think you under estimate how large the GPU mining infrastructure is. 200GH/s is a drop in the ocean. Maxcoin is chugging about 10TH/s alone and it's all GPU miners.
And miners move where the profit is, and the profit is not determined by how much a coin is mined... in fact, mining hashrate lags behind profitability since they flock to coins after they become more profitable.

Yes, if you see the tx on another node after it is sent (with a fee) then it's pretty sure the payment will confirm. There is no need to wait for a confirmation unless it's a particularly large amount.

Fair point,but I think you are over thinking it. Bitcoin may be the name of Bitcoin but it's also a term like Web. So they mean it like Web 2.0. At the rate Bitcoin Core makes released we're hardly going to see Bitcoin 2.0 in the next 10 years. The next release will be 0.10 ;) and they'll probably never get to 1.0, letalone 2.0

Bad analogy here because here Gox have software which generates the txs to broadcast and that is what is recorded in the api. Since they are valid txs that we can see resulted in being mined, it proved that whoever has the private keys is also able to use Gox software to create the txs. Seems an unlikely combination when one could just spend the funds anyway.

Clearly, you need to believe the developers since if this was really the problem Mark claimed, bitcoin would have had to have been fixed immediately.
Look, all txmalleability says is when you generate a tx and broadcast it, when it confirms, the txid may or may not be the same as the one you generated. That is it. Nothing else.
So if your backoffice is tracking the tx by the txid you generated and broadcast, it's possible that what actually confirms in the blockchain will have a different ID. So it's just a tracking issue. 
Given this was known about since 2011, it's well known that you should track payments by other means, and not the txid (until it is confirmed). That's a business logic issue, nothing to do with bitcoin protocol.

Note what I said about a free to allowance in each block. That is a space allowance. If you sent ants with a lot of inputs aka dust, the tx would be large. The larger the tx the less priority it is given when no fee is attached. A single input tax with no fee would likely go through very easily.

It is very simple. If a customer claims a transaction has not been committed to the blockchain, don't verify using the txid, but look if the inputs were spent. If you need to broadcast again or make a new transaction, simply use the same inputs, that way, no double spending can occur.

This is exactly one of the scams MtGox pulled. They were short on BTC a long time ago and used AML/KYC crap to confiscate 80,000BTC from customers. Stamp's behaviour points to a bitcoin solvency issue. Yes they "proved" their reserves in February, but they did so with an audit done in November. I am surprised no-one picked up on that...

Lol. The pool has been ranging between 48 and 51 all day. Look about, plenty other screenshots from others.
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:53:14
I am just clarifying a point. People in general and your post (to me) does not emphasis the technical detail of how payments are sent, i.e. a message is broadcast and relayed across the entire network to all (most) nodes which then sits in the mempool. Even if someone tries to double spend, most nodes wont even relay that because they already have the inputs waiting to be spent in the mempool.
This is why you can rely on a tx providing you see it at another node. The problem is bitpay seem to only have one node in one location, when really they should be running several full nodes at different global locations which can then feed back info to their main server since it's clear a broadcast may not be relayed to every node, and some might get missed. 
That is by the way where the so called ability to double spend comes from, which is also why it makes it so remote. It assumes the double spend reaches a miner BEFORE your tx (and that that miner solves the block).
@_date: 2014-03-06 08:20:29
Nodes will not relay transactions the contain an input that was already broadcast, so it will never even get broadcast. You would have to simultaneously broadcast separate txs from different networks.

You obviously don't understand the nature of the scam and how it related with mining difficulty. They knowingly lied about their delivery schedules. None of the products will ROI. They lie to people to fund their R&amp;D and make a profit. They refuse to give refunds as REQUIRED by law. As such they make a profit regardless of whether the end customer's miner will be able to make back their investment given the rising difficulty levels.

simple, they short bitcoin at 1:1 leverage. if the price of btc goes down they make back the same USD value. if the price goes up, they lost btc but the value of the coins goes up to make the shortfall. there are also other options like futures contracts or options, but so far there arent any options contracts (that i am aware) for bitcoin. in any case using these strategies one can preserve the fiat value of the coins and not be exposed to volatility.

@_date: 2014-02-18 17:18:37
Because the transaction cannot be made to look like it didn't happen. You can and always track the script inputs, not the txid which is not fixed until there is a confirmation in a block.
If you resend a payment, you should always spend the same inputs, or at least one of the inputs you sent originally so the network can detect a double spend.
It was entirely their own fault, and know about since 2011 - written on bitcoin.it wiki which is owned by Mark Karpeles himself.
Bitcoin transactions are by very nature malleable, and some are intentionally so. Mark knew about this issue, and when  he implemented his own native bitcoin wallet software, he chose to track payments by the txid (a hash of the entire transaction message) rather than by a hash of the elements that cant change.
Further, his staff were badly trained and easily duped.

They don't consider Bitcoin under their rules because they regard Bitcoin as a decentralized virtual currency with _no administrator or controllers_. The reason e-gold and liberty reserve et al got hammered was because there was a central party to go after.
A contentious hardfork where a group of people are able to force their wishes could easily make Bitcoin centralized or have the appearance of being centralized, at which point it's not unreasonable to assume they _would_ change their opinion.

There are no ASICs on the horizon for Scrypt. Some people think they might be able to do FPGAs but you have to understand it will not scale up. The benefit of FPGA will at most be the ability to run the same kh for less wattage. 
Again, you have to understand the mechanics of Scrypt to understand it cannot be scaled up like ASICs, that's absolutely for sure. I'd rather not get into the specifics, but there is plenty on litecoin forums about it.

Actually, no bitcoins are ever sent. One simply broadcasts events signed by public keys which are then added to a public blockchain. Clients read the chain and can determine if money has been signed over or not.

Regarding mining - the norm with CGT is to assign a value at the time you receive the asset. When you liquidate the asset you calculate CGT based on the difference. If you mined a bitcoin today, your price could be assumed to be market value.
There are complications because mining is not free, so there are hardware and running costs which can no doubt be used to offset value.
Certainly at this stage you need an accountant and you need to be as honest in the disclosure so in the end if there is a difference of opinion, the worst that happens is an adjustment on the bill, which could even go in your favour. But an incorrect disclosure could lead to claims of dishonesty and then all bets are off.

Go to key management and import key, then scan the public key. it will add it to the wallet.
If you want to just the balance, you can go to cold storage and scan the public key.

My apologies - I got my BTC eventually. The for the record, I made three withdrawals. two large ones late 7th. Then one small one for 1.1BTC in the morning. The payment for the small one came after 6 hours. One of the large payments was sent after about 24 hours, then the final one came about 12 hours after that.
WAY TOO LONG for a bitcoin withdrawal. No excuses, sorry. There is a problem. Support answered once and then never updated the tickets...  Remember this was not a broadcast delay, this was a lack of a broadcast at all, and they were clearly sending people's smaller ones manually but prioritising them (like by 1.1BTC which was made several hours after, and arrived first).
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:07:51
I made a separate 1.12 withdrawal today, 6 hours later it got sent. By larger ones are still unseen. This proves, they are selectively honoring requests... just like BFL did with the Jalapenos in the beginning to keep the orders flowing since most people had ordered the small units, they figured they could get away with keeping up appearances while they bought themselves time.

Critical flaw here: the hash should be performed locally and the hash uploaded to the server. It can be done in the browser in javascript, or using the android app itself.

that argument is bullshit. making a fork popular is not as easy as changing the code. next, 99.999999% of people cannot code, so even if they dont like something, they cant change it. thirdly, if you are adding a feature or fixing a bug, you have to forever therein merge with upstream to keep your fork up to date. forking is great for code contribution within a distributed VCS frame, like git, but open source is not the freedom you say. far far from it. change is expensive.

This is why you should force a refund via Paypal. You can always cancel a sale before delivery and often even a few days after delivery. That is the law.

By volume, bitstamp is generally equal to gox now. So in terms of size, they are the only 2nd choice.

Because you have no idea, given a certain input to a hash algo what the output will be. hash("cat") and hash("mat") will produce completely different hashes. Since the target is taken from the leading digits of the hash (converted to a number), the hash must meet be lower or equal to the target.
Each nonce you increment will cause a wildly different hash. There for there is no way to predict what nonce you should use, therefore, your of finding a wining has is random - i.e. you must be lucky. Since everyone is hashing a slightly different block (the payout address for the mining reward is at least different even if everything else was equal), so therefore your chances of wining against everyone else are basically random.
@_date: 2013-11-07 07:43:10
Use a BIP0038 private key then the private key is protected by a password. You can generate them at  - select paper wallet and encrypt. Because it uses Scrypt, it cannot be brute forced (because scrypt makes unusual demands to generate even one hash so it's not possible to do many per second - even on a high end computer).
@_date: 2013-12-12 19:46:38
It's quite simply. Git has the same tamper-proof mechanism used by the blockchain because each commit  takes the last commit hash as one of it's inputs. Secondly, the author uses PGP signatures. You simply keep a copy of git on your machine and if someone tampers with the repository you are going to know. Changes are incrementally quite obvious. Tampering is self evident - and there are enough eyes on the projects to raise alarms if something does happen.
That same "set of eyes" is what has alerted the world to companies issuing bogus SSL certificate, so we know it works in practice.
Don't let paranoia turn to blind panic.

You just don't understand margin trade evidently. Margin trade is used the world over for stocks, futures, etc etc. Check the SEC for information: 
Lenders put money up for margin trade and earn interest (called "swap"). Lenders money is secured because to margin trade you need a certain amount of funds to trade yourself. If your position goes out by more than you can afford to close it by, then you receive a margin call and the position is auto-closed.
Bitfinex is the first exchange to have real margin trade.

People dont want to listen to it, but MtGox definitely having more problems than they are owning up to.
Don't worry, people here are stupid with greed. They see higher prices at MtGox and they dont want to believe it's not real. Fortunately Bitstamp and Bitfinex exist (and bitfinex often has prices higher than MtGox) so if you really need to cash out at MtGox prices, you can do so at Bitfinex.
What's extremely fishy for my regarding MtGox is how Bitstamp and Bitfinex and BTCe (!!!!!) especially BTCe all have zero problems with withdrawals via wire... and BTCe is so out there it's almost what you'd expect from a Tor site - they just dont give a shit about anything (but they are honest) - yet they are able to process ten millions of dollars a week each....
Intelligence wanes when large amounts of (easy) money are involved. Be wise - stay away from Mtgox. While they might not be dishonest, they are proven incompetent and uncommunicative. They are having more problems than they are letting on and this is 100% shown by delayed BTC withdrawals. And fuckoff to anyone who harps on about cold storage - The aforementioned exchanges all use cold storage yet their withdrawals are pretty snappy - Gox is trouble, and that's just the facts of the matter.

@_date: 2013-12-26 12:57:45
I really hate the way the media explains mining. What miners are doing is building the transaction ledger. In doing so they get to issue themselves bitcoin according to the protocol rules. A miner cannot do whatever they like because the rest of the network needs to agree on what they do.
The "math puzzle" they are doing is just part of the "proof of work" that ensures they cant just make up the transaction history, or rewrite history. It involves complex cryptography which means the past history is somehow encoded in the current transaction block.
So a miner basically does the following:
1. Listens on the network for broadcast transaction
2. Checks if they are valid
3. Includes a bunch into a "block"
4. Issues themselves 25 BTC or whatever the current allowed amount is, to an address they own
5. Include the hash of the previous block
Taking all that, they then hash the data with an ever increasing nonce until the hash meets the "difficulty" criterion. This is done to (a) slow the network down and (b) make it computationally expensive to do so thus making it infeasible to rewrite the entire history (previous blocks) or even a small part of it.
This also creates competition between miners since they are all competing to find the solution to **their** block - first who gets a valid hash value and broadcasts it to the network wins - then everyone else will drop what they are doing and start again, this time including the new block hash instead.
@_date: 2013-12-07 20:24:39
Yeah. Fact is, they account for decent percentage of Bitstamp's daily volume.
The last 24 hours is 
Bitfinex 46663 BTC total volume
Bitfinex own volume is 11549
Means they accounted for 35114 BTC at bitstamp, who's listed as having 88136 BTC volume in the last 24 hours 
So **Bitfinex accounted for 40% of Bitstamp's overall volume** in the last 24 hours.

They are not being aggressive. They just have fucked up laws and this stuff fits so they think. The only problem is bitcoin is not a currency so it cannot flout foreign exchange laws... it will take a lot of high profile battling in court for this, or, for the government to specifically regulate it.
Overall you chaps are way to "oh everyone is out to get us" mentality. Just understand that different countries can have wildly different legal systems in place.
For example, some countries everything is legal unless prohibited.  In others, everything is prohibited unless specifically allowed.

Sorry, but these coins do not have anything like that. The problem is a lot of coins are minted and never traded.
I can release a coin today with a premine of 21MM coins and they start trading on Cryptsy or other small exchange for whatever value, I cant suddenly claim just because *some* coins are being traded at around $0.05 that I have a market cap of $1MM.
Litecoin/Bitcoin can claim these market caps because coins are being traded en mass, not just being minted for pump and dump.

The are paid to the miners. The idea is eventually, when block reward goes away, the fees will still make it worth while to mine. Obviously by that point we could be up to VISA's 20,000 transactions a second or whatever...
So currently miners get the block reward (25BTC and the transaction fees).

If you use an SSD drive, writing over your files will not work - there is no way to secure erase from an SSD. This is because each SSD cell has a max number of writes before fail. So when writing to the same file, the SSD will just write to other less used cells rather than overwrite the ones already containing your file. Worse, some have a little backup memory so there is absolutely no way of erasing a single file.
What you want to be doing in these cases is creating a Truecrypt container (that is an encrypted file) which you can mount as a hard drive. You can store your keys in there. Now you can delete that container and it will just leave a bunch of random shit on the SSD.

No, it's pretty certain it cannot be reasonably brute forced. Scrypt does not get substantially faster by CPU power because it's memory intensive.  There is no way to optimize it down like you can with a standard hashing algo for example.

You are missing the point. Coin ownership exists only by what is recorded on the blockchain. Coins are deposited to "addresses". Those addresses can only be spent by using the private key that owns them.

I've had a similar round of stupidity from them.

No **this does not harm bitcoin** and here's why:
Privacy requires BOTH parties to behave. A is a well known address, B is someone who takes their privacy carefully. B generates a new address but sends to A, now we know we probably can get B's identity from A.
Next, Satoshi recommended this. we just got lazy.
Lastly, reusing the same address is exactly what enabled the Android/Java Secure Random attack that lead to 55BTC being stolen recently from blockchain.info details here: 
The large mining pools can de-prioritize transactions to reused addresses thus providing incentive to use unique addresses. This does not stop addresses being reused, but it now puts pressure on wallet providers to implement BIP32 which makes new address creation automatic and transparent to the user.

Simple. Open an account on bitstamp and bitfinex - get verified and then send three equal amounts to each exchange. $1MM is not a large buy, but obviously you should buy in bits and various levels so you don't affect the price.

Metoric rises can be bubbles or they can be s-curves. We ain't close to the vertical yet either.
bitcoin is a honey badger, and it doesnt care. We are monetizing a currency... not a stock. The maths are clear. If this succeeds as a popular currency, the value has to be hundreds, no, thousands the current price.. and then some.

I do. Look, this is a PSA. I'm not asking for help. I am not the only person with this problem - MtGox is not processing bitcoin transaction - from 1.1BTC up to 62BTC not being processed after 18 hours. That's not normal - used gox for a long long time and never ever had this issue. Maybe had to wait 30 mins once, but not hours. 
Their support has not been helpful.
There are problems at MtGox. There is no question about this - maybe they got hacked and are concealing losses? Who knows. They have problems.
We also know their fiat withdrawal nonesense is deeper than it looks - otherwise Bitstamp would be experiencing the same problems. Their volume is comparable to gox, yet they manage to process fiat wire transfers without any fuss.
This is a PSA. If you dont like it down vote it, I am only trying to warn people that Gox problem is getting worse now.
@_date: 2013-11-07 19:03:07
that is exactly my point.... they should actually have a surplus of BTC because they are getting pretty hefty fees. 
I think Gox has been juggling and this only came to light because an arbitrage opportunity occurred at Bitstamp causing a flood of people to request withdrawals - so they ran out because they have been up to something.

What would you consider "popular use"? I'm obviously not saying bitcoin will be at peak popularity but I am saying in 12 months from now it's use will be wide spread, and growing wildly. I would expect more major retailers to have taken it on include more highstreet brands. Bitcoin will be a household name and many many people will be using it 12 months from now.
We will enter the s-curve of growth probably in 2015 - that's where it goes vertical - literally to da moon.
I am happy to work out specific terms of the deal. I am very confident of winning.

When you think there will be  a price adjustment, you see with the view to buy back a little cheaper. Do the maths to find your zero profit buy back after fees. This was you accumulate more coins and more value.
Don't invest money you need and you will have less emotion. I bagged 8.86BTC extra from this crash doing this. It's not easy, you gotta study the markets and ditch that emotion - and overcome greed (oh, just a little more, oh I'll wait just a little more.... syndrome).
The price will rise and fall remember, that, but history shows BTC is bullish - so DO NOT CASH OUT your coins if you end up on the wrong side of a trade. Send them into cold storage and wait.

Sorry dude, but you have this all wrong. Bitcoin cant be killed, and sure this is a chilling effect, but it was only to be expected after such news. Companies have just got scared. The government will come back later with their regulations and everything will continue as normal.
This is why I keep telling people who are all "fuck the gov, fuck regulations" why actually, government involvement is good because it gives confidence to the masses. 
There will come a point when bitcoin is so big it wont matter but in the beginning, governments are actually helpful to the movement. They cant stamp it out because it's going to get more and more powerful on the world stage. Cant be ignored. But govs are right to tread cautiously imo.

Before everyone opens their mouth, they should go read the forums a bit and see what the Bitcoin devs are saying. At the moment, the ill-informed and screaming (because they can) and as a result you have stupid comments like OPs which clearly show zero understanding of the fundamental issues.
The bitcoin devs are not going to allow anything shitty into the bitcoin code, period.
As for building databases from the blockchain, it's happening already, nothing you can do about it - that's public mineable data. BIP32 (go read about it) solves a lot of problems and reinstates some wishes of Satoshi.
The problem is online wallets and wallet software havent bothered to implement it yet... if you want to put pressure, go bug them to implement this important feature. It solves a lot lot lot of problems and makes data-mining very hard.

It's not more complex, it's just a more complete account of what you need to write. As they get more inquiries they are going to require more information. Since all of this is NOT COMPULSORY for paypal to do, you need to understand they are doing you a favor and spend the extra few minutes to make sure they get all the information they need. If you have not already opened a paypal dispute (and had it closed for the 45 day expiry limit) for example, they can just refused to do anything special for you.
I'm also  quite surprised at the impatience of some redditers - they are expecting a response same day and on weekends - again I state: PAYPAL IS NOT OBLIGATED TO HELP YOU AT ALL for claims out of the 45 day window. Be patient. You will get a reply one way or another. Just wait for it.

Since your company will want fiat payment, just use the options to cashout immediately on payment. MtGox have a merchant option for this for example and probably BitPay (havent looked), so the amount of BTC to pay is calculate at the time of sale, and immediately converted to fiat t the going rate. That way you get exactly the amount you need. Avoids risk since the idea is to accept payment in BTC (gaining all the benefits), not to speculate in currency as an investment. Before you freedom fighters downvote, the fact is, what we need now are people accepting BTC. Replacement of fiat will happen in it's own time, first we need to get BTC flowing.

Sigh - this is exactly what Satoshi intended. Read the paper - he did not intend addresses to be re-used. Never, we got lazy. There are actually cryptographic concerns when addresses are being reused - it's not safe theoretically. So I dont really care what you think is best, Satoshi already said address reuse was not good, and that is what we are going back to because that was Satoshi's wish in the first place.

Surely another approach is the confirmation time. If confirmations happened every 2 minutes instead of ten then we wouldn't need such large block sizes. I realize that's a tall order because in order to reduce confirmation time the block reward would have to be adjusted down so there are still only 21 million coins mined over the same time period.
But right there, reduce down to 2 mins with 1MB blocks you have just increased transaction capacity per second by 5 times.

I agree about India for now, but don't underestimate India. The amount of wealth there is pretty frightening too... and they have nasty capital controls just like China.
I don't think any company that has capital controls will appreciate any money transfer system they cannot control. As much as China understands bitcoin, I dont think they quite appreciate the value of the bitcoin ecosystem can become compatible to the Yuan money supply. What happens at that point is anyone's guess.
Remember a countries ability to manipulate money is key to their power and control over the economy (for better or worse). Bitcoin is a huge spanner in those works - but I doubt they believe BTC can becomes something large enough to enter that scale yet.

I don't know how it is in the US, but in the UK goods can be seized "on paper" without actually being taken away. For example your house could be seized which then forbids you to legally sell your house, same goes for other assets, including cash. It does not have to necessarily be "removed". I suppose it could be feasible to seize someone's bitcoins on paper, thus making it illegal to spend them (i.e you go to jail if you do). This would assume the coins can be linked to an identity.

The trick with chargebacks is this: The CC company informs BFL there is a dispute. They give BFL a couple of weeks to provide proof of delivery. BFL use this period to ship and deliver the goods. They can then dispute the chargeback because the goods arrived. This doesnt work with Paypal - since right now, if you follow the methods in  the will just refund you because BFL broke their TOS (no pre-orders) and they have had so many complaints about it.

My advice to anyone is invest now. Even if it's 1 BTC.
Max Keiser said, when it was $350:
"think bitcoin is too expensive? it will look cheap when the price is $500"
Even at $1080, the price as of now, it will look cheap when it's $10k. And if bitcoin succeeds, which it will, they have to be worth a lot more to provide enough value to go around. 1 bitcoin will be like winning the lottery soon. 
Buy as much as you can afford (to lose).
that's my heartfelt advice to everyone.

ASICs are already messing with the money creation - all bitcoins might get issued 55 years early at this rate (according to thegenesisblock website). There was never a risk of government overtaking network capacity. Already just with GPU the network become 8 times more powerful than the combined power of the worlds top supercomputers. Infact, ASICs could be the undoing since you just need Intel/AMD chip supergiants to come alone and fab  25nm under a defense contract style budget and you could create in order of magnitudes of hash power for relatively little money. The GPU based network cannot be scaled so easily by one entity. This is exactly why Litecoin was created.

Just to clarify, the nonces are incremented serially from 0 because it's just as random and more efficient than randomly choosing nonces and having to keep track so you don't pick twice. It's random because the hash will wild vary (unpredictably) as you increase the nonce.

They *may* ask for ID but if you wire money it will be credited anyway. If they want ID after the transfer is credited, you will know when you press any withdraw button, it will has there is a hold. In this case you just upload ID+bill to the support area with your username and usually the hold is removed in 24 hours. Transfers for me take 24 hours - faster than Bitstamp!

But this is just paranoia nonsense.  AML/KYC is a reality. Just because Bitcoin is something new doesnt mean somehow AML/KYC should not apply to fiat links just as it does for **everything** else. Even buying a car with a large amount of cash has AML/KYC requirements attached.
The fact is, once Bitcoin goes fully anonymous and there is a pure bitcoin economy, AML/KYC will be unenforceable. But that is not the point.
The next thing is a matter of gov monetary policy. China is saying they dont want financial sector playing and creating derivatives with a current unknown and little understood "volatile commodity" because it could have knockon effects to their financial system: China get's it very clearly. But if they wanted to stamp it out, they would have just done it (forget enforceability). They already did so with QQcoin years back.
Clearly they recognise bitcoin has something to offer but they want to insulate their financial sector from bitcoin for the time being until they understand it more. That is a GOOD thing - the last thing bitcoin needs are corrupt bankers fucking things up for us.
The fact is, this is good for BTC. It's good because of the publicity, it's good because of the recognition... and eventually it'll be good because govs put bitcoin in a box that sends a signal to more regulated financial sector that bitcoin is a good thing.
And it's damn good for traders - events like this are fabulous ways to increase portfolio from the ensuing panic. 
Bitcoin is showing great resilience.

You are incorrect. 
bitaddress allows you to create encrypted private keys (BIP0038) - so even if someone steals or photographs your paper wallet it's not gonna matter. And btw, brute forcing a scrypt based key is not feasible at all. It's just not gonna happen.
bitaddress generates the keys client side in your browser, not on the server so a generated key cannot be intercepted.

When it jumped to $20, people though it was too late. When it jumped to $50, people thought it was too late. When it reached $266 people though it was too late, today at $320, you will think it's too late. But bitcoin is only getting started. The panic buying hasnt even begun. Just wait till it hits $1000.
And remember buy in the dips. if you are a day trader and learn the art of selling just before a sell-off correction, you should rebuy the dips. If something horrible happens for a while and the price tanks and you don't get a chance to trade that change - DO NOTHING. Just move the coins to cold storage and forget about them. Fiddling is your worst enemy. Invest what you dont need to spend then you wont have the need to fiddle or try to be over smart.

If you see Withdraw Hold this happens usually the first time you make a wire deposit. Their bank wants KYC/AML. BTCe is just not good at communicating this fact. Once you are done with their bank, you are "verified" so wont experience this problem again. I suggest bitstamp or bitfinex to exit your money though - you can sell at a higher rate than BTCe. Bitfinex trades LTC.

If you stick an order for $1MM of BTC, ie 1,370 BTC at current prices, then you might affect the market price. So you would be better dividing the buy over two exchanges, and also buy up over time. Making orders of ~50-100 sync on each exchange and expect to pay in a certain range. Do it over the day. I didnt see your edit. But overall, ~1400BTC orders are nothing special to write home about - just be smart so to influence the market. There are other buying strategies if you are a whale, but it requires more funds than $1MM to execute.

Cold wallets take exactly 1 confirmation to fun. You transfer coins out, wait for a confirmation and they can then meet their obligations. The fact is, people have been waiting for 24 hours. It does not take 24 hours to get coins out of cold storage - it takes 10 minutes. If it was overnight at gox, fine, they get to wake up and fill the hot wallets,.... but they had 24 hours already.

It's the number of dollars above or below the current price. So the example you go long at 800, price rises to 810, you then set a trailing stop ASK at say 5. The stoploss will get triggered at 805. If the price rises to 812 then then stoploss would be raised to 807 and so on as the price rises.

Bitfinex is good. I have good experiences with Btc-e too. Best place to send your money in first at least. You wire the money, it arrives the next day usually. The first time you do it and money arrives, check the withdraw button and if it says HOLD - you should send your ID docs to support in this case, as the bank has asked for it.  Be warned, BTCe accounts need to be open for 3 full days before they allow any withdrawals at all.

The source is open by virtue of it being published source. That is open source. Closed source means you, the public, don't get to see the code.
Open source has zero to do with whether outside contributors are welcome or not.

There is a fundamental difference. Your money exists in a shared ledger called the blockchain. That's the **only** place it exists. You absolutely cannot make a physical representation of it. A paper wallet, physical coins, phone wallet app, software wallet etc only hold the private keys used to sign messages that can be broadcast to miners to then update the public ledger. 
You can destroy a piece of paper called a bank note, then it's gone. You cannot spend it. The ability to spend requires the physical token. Bitcoin only requires the private key which can be replicated in a number of ways.
My point is you can always convert your electronic money into physical notes or other physical instrument ("taking it out of the computer"). You cannot do this with bitcoin - it's fundamentally different.

You evidently don't understand the maths nor the technology behind IC development. You can do anything you want, but whether it scales up and is cost effective is quite another matter. FPGAs have always been able to do scrypt by the way, it's just they cannot do it as well as a computer can because they have much less memory. Early tests were a $300 FPGA got like 12kh vs an 7950 which managed 630kh (and costs $300). So it's not that you can't make an IC to do Scrypt... you get the idea I hope.
@_date: 2013-11-03 17:21:47
A cold storage wallet is one where the private key has never gone anywhere near a computer. BIP0038 paper wallets are perfect for this because you can just send money to it without ever having to load it up. If you do need to spend it later, you can load the wallet into blockchain or something, spend what you need, then transfer the entire amount back to a new paperwallet (encrypted). Safest way if you are super paranoid.

Said like a true American. When will you guys realise China account for WAY more BTC daily than the rest of the world combined. Huobi itself has more volume than the entire BTCUSD market. China is a big deal. Prices hit gold parity because of them, and price halved because of them. Stop living in a wholly existence - China matters. And for that matter, China matters in the world economy - you cannot deny their importance. What you say is the same crap that the US spouts about their economy yet who is the biggest holder of US debt - China. Who us the biggest creditor of the US - China. 
China matters a lots. Like it or hate it, but it's a fact of life. Sure as death, sure as sunrise.

Really important quote:
"Even if a bad guy does overpower the network, it's not like he's instantly rich.  All he can accomplish is to
take back money he himself spent, like bouncing a check.  To exploit it, he would have to buy something from a
merchant, wait till it ships, then overpower the network and try to take his money back.  I don't think he
could make as much money trying to pull a carding scheme like that as he could by generating bitcoins.  With a
zombie farm that big, he could generate more bitcoins than everyone else combined."

The problem is there are a lot of bots trading now. Over the month they buy and sell and very small margins as their 30 day average increases the fess go right down so they can trade on very small swings of price, less than a $1. That's why manual day traders of little volume cant really do much since at current prices you need a spread of $1.30 or so to break even. Bots trading at 0.4% or whatever only need 80 cents or so... and so it goes.
