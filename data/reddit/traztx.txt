Congrats.  You've just come up with the new "proof of nodes" concept!
Whoever has the most nodes wins! ;)

Demand is higher for coins that are more secure.  Regulating stolen coins increases security.

It's interesting that they will search multiple exchanges to match the best price to each order.  I wonder how they will avoid piling up coins on lower price exchanges and piling up USD on higher price exchanges.  Are they limiting to domestic exchanges that are quicker/easier for arbitrage?

As long as someone has an account with more value than the phone used for 2FA, the phone shouldn't be carried around, subject to being dropped or getting wet or left on a table at some cafe.
Consider getting a new phone for everyday life, and take the old one off your service.  You can leave the old one in a secure place and just get it and turn it on with wifi whenever you need the 2FA from it.

IDK.  I wonder when I'm watching an altcoin ghost town.  Huge bid/ask spread.  Level II just showing the same makers waiting.  Spontaneous large transactions appearing randomly inside the spread.  Maybe it's bots taking faster than level II can post new maker prices.  But still, I wonder...

Dumping it all in a market sell will plow through bids, giving you not such a good average price.  Also you'll pay a "taker" fee if you do this on GDAX, which would be a good choice in exchange if you want to withdraw the $ (GDAX = Coinbase's exchange)
Putting it all in a big sell limit order may cause people to see resistance in upper price action, also causing a dip in offers.  If each order is above the highest bidder, then you'll be a "maker", which I believe is a free transaction fee on GDAX.
Consider ordering a series of SMALL limit sells, and wait in between each filled order, so that your sales don't impact the price action much.

No.  I think it's safer to diversify

Well, more like a more secure market place.
Consider that theft violates security.  Refusing to buy stolen coins helps to reduce the incentive to steal and sell because those who refuse are opting out of demand for such coins.
Therefore, the thief (supply side) has a smaller set of buyers (demand side) available.  Smaller demand = lower price.  Here's what these buyers offer: "We know that those guys aren't buying your coins, so we can either buy from them at the common price or you can entice us to buy from you for a discount."
Alternatively, the thief will need to remove any sign of the coins being stolen, hence "laundering" the coins.  If the coins don't look stolen anymore, then the set of buyers available is wider because it includes buyers who refuse stolen goods.

Consider shorts, "FOMO" or "fear of missing out", momentum plays, and "pump and dump clubs".
The pump and dump clubs pick an asset to pump.  They work together to buy up the asset, which can cause the price to rise if they have enough funds.  Some members might even get on trading social media and mention the price action.
Outsiders (people not in the club) may see the action as a sign of support for the asset.
Bears who hold shorts may decide to cover, which adds to the buying.
Bull FOMO players worry that the asset is only going to get more expensive if they wait, so they buy too.
Momentum players buy because of the belief that they can get in and out before the buying frenzy loses momentum.  Some may set a limit to sell higher and others may use a walking stop-loss to wait until the price reverses and then sell.
The pump and dump club stops buying and lets these other players bring the price higher.  At some point, they are given signal to dump.
Then they start dumping.  This can cause the rise to reverse if they have assets to affect it, so they might sell as well as sell short. This can trigger stop loss sales from the outsider momentum traders.  Outsider bears may sell short from FOMO.  Outsider momentum players may short too.
Some outsiders benefit from this manipulation, though.  People who held before the pump could see the action without a good reason and take profits, for example.

Buy low sell high

Do binance or bitmex have margin/shorts?  Would withdrawing coins borrowed by shorts force a buy to cover?    Could that issue be a factor towards freezing withdrawals?  I'm wondering if resuming withdrawals could create a short-squeeze like situation.
@_date: 2018-02-07 23:31:35
That's the original cost.  The average price is "whatever we can get for this asset".  It comes from supply and demand.  After mining, the remaining supply comes from people selling their assets.  The demand comes from people buying more assets.
If demand is higher than supply, the sellers can ask a higher price.  If the demand is lower, the buyers can bid a lower price.
I think you probably understand how price can be higher than cost, because holders don't want to sell at a loss unless they have to.
But how could price be lower than cost?
One scenario is the seller who needs funds to handle an emergency.  Something broke that needs to be fixed, or bail a family member out of jail, or whatever.  They don't have time to put up a limit sale and wait for someone to eventually buy at that price.  They need the finds now, so they sell even if this means at a loss.
Another scenario is when demand generally comes down.  When this happens, people can profit from selling short assets.  This is when you use a margin account to borrow someone else's coins and sell them, then buy later at a lower price and return the coins to the original person.  The original person still has the same amount of coins.  The short seller, in this case, profits because they sold high and later bought low.

For sales tax, require merchants to ring up purchases and add the tax at the time of sale.
For income tax, require employers to report wages.
For capital gains tax, require exchanges to gather customer info and report transactions.

Today I bought some BTC for various amounts of PPC as the PPC/BTC price spiked up.  I'll sell some BTC for PPC later on when the PPC/BTC price settles back to normal.
You're welcome =)

Business regulations often create barriers of entry which result in fewer but bigger fish in the pond.
Do you have examples of protective regulations that avoid this issue?
@_date: 2018-02-01 14:01:15
I've been buying whenever the price goes down and selling whenever the price goes up.

The difficulty producing new coins regulates the increase in supply over time (BTC available for miners to sell).
So you have miners willing to mine and sell as long as there are buyers offering more than the energy needed to produce new coins.
So the floor price in relation to a mining business is the cost of energy.
If the price goes below that, miners shut down and after a couple of weeks, the system auto-adjusts the difficulty to make it a little easier.  This creates a new floor that is lower than before.

I've heard of bitfinex offering margin accounts and shorts but have no personal experience with them.

Exchanges allow buyers to post bids at whatever price they are willing to pay for coins.  They also allow sellers to post an asking price at whatever they are willing to get for their coins.  These are called limit orders, because they limit the price that they agree to.
So, if you want more coins, you can look at the best asking price and decide if you want to buy from them at that price.
If a lot of people like that price and buy from it, then eventually those sell orders will be all filled and then the next best asking price is from people who posted orders a little bit higher in price.
If there are people willing to buy from those, then their orders get filled and more buyer will need to buy from people who are willing to sell even higher.  This is how the price goes up.
Conversely.  Some people are ready to sell coins to the highest bidder.  If enough of them sell, then the bid orders all get filled at the best price and we are left with bids at lower prices.  If there are people still willing to sell at that price, then those orders get filled too.  This is how the price goes down.

Maybe someone or their bot is managing to pick up 10-40 BTC at the difference in price and the "walls" are limit orders for arbitration.
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:49:36
Exactly right.
However, in some situations arbitrage is more challenging.  A few months ago, there were reports of coins trading at higher USD on Korean exchanges due to the difficulty of moving dollars out of that country for arbitrage.  A popular price charting site, coinmarketcap if I remember correctly, decided to exclude those exchanges because their prices were not reflected in the rest of the world's exchanges.  This caused some traders to believe the price had declined substantially and some people blamed that for some of the panic selling that came afterwards.
Arbitrage for crypto trading pairs (such as ETH/BTC) aren't as sensitive to difficulties moving assets, so they tend to reflect prices pretty closely from one exchange to another.

Sure, but the differences from the barriers of entry can be quite extreme when we compare regulations.
For example, medicine.  I'm guessing it took a huge amount of resources, perhaps in the billions, to be able to produce and sell Desoxyn.  Meanwhile, there are meth labs, in poor rural areas, investing perhaps hundreds to cook a similar drug for the black market.  Of course, it's highly risky to invest in prohibited business, but it does indicate that there is a substantial and artificial barrier of entry created by the centralized institutions that govern and the powers that influence them.  Imagine how much lower the costs of healthcare could be if tried-and-true medicine engineering designs/methods were open sourced and in the public domain.
Another example is in the farm equipment sector.  There is an "open source ecology" idea emerging.
I agree big difference in start-up for auto factory vs flower shop.  On the other hand, big difference in today's florist dealing in tulips than during the "tulip bubble" back in the 15th century, heh heh.
@_date: 2018-04-17 21:19:34
Wouldn't an unbridled market also lack barriers of entry?  In a regulated market, larger interests are able to push for regulations that raise barriers of entry and therefore lower competition.
@_date: 2018-04-13 20:23:26
I didn't think you could deduct those fees.  I figured on just eating those costs (they are really small for me).
