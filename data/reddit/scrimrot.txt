As such, for there to be an agreed to change, everyone would need to adjust the setting at the same time.  This versus downloading and installing new code.  Either case is coordinated work and consistent with a hard fork.

I agree that hard forks are serious business.
My suggestion is a hard fork that preserves the status quo, but enables quick response when their is mutual agreement.
If deployed with a configuration with 1MB limit, anyone altering it would have the same results as someone recompiling the code and running it on the production network.
I think I'm missing something, so I appreciate your comments.
@_date: 2015-06-11 13:46:54
The soft limit could be set by social contract.  The software could be modified such that it rejects any blocks greater than its soft limit.  That effectively makes the soft limit a hard limit, and an easily changed hard limit.
All the engineering can be done upfront to assuage the concerns of those that believe the network can't move quickly.  The initial limit could be set at 1MB to address the concerns of those that think that there is not yet a problem.
Compromise should be the name of the game.
@_date: 2015-06-11 14:30:41
My contention is that the 'rules of the game' are different for all nodes even now.  Anyone can run whatever code they want to.  But they don't!  The same forces that are at work now would remain in place.
Status quo would be maintained with the functionality for larger blocks deployed. 
This is less of a technical solution than a political one.

When option 1 doesn't accomplish the goal, try option 2.  Things are simpler when everyone is using the same infrastructure, but to your point, there are other options.  Bitcoin is benefiting from the network effect, but this is clearly a long-tail situation, and there will be other solutions.  A small percentage of those solutions will have significant share.  The size of that share will be inversely proportional to Bitcoins ability to meet the need.     
@_date: 2015-06-23 14:17:07
If I understand correctly, regardless of the blocksize, LN offers the advantage of zero-conf transactions and extremely low fee microtransactions.  
Both of these better the Bitcoin ecosystem greatly, so I am not convinced that the Blockstream guys need the smaller blocksize.  I take them at their word and believe it is really about fears about centralization for them.
I'm in favor of GA's proposal.  If we find that the number of nodes is falling, I trust that we'll come up with a solution for that as well.

@_date: 2015-06-11 14:11:25
But a hard limit that is easy to change.  In my opinion, such a solution is a reasonable compromise for both camps.  It preserves the status quo and gets a version of the software out that can quickly and easily respond to a change in block size if there are scaling issues.
The economic majority of hashing is never going to be bound by whatever you or I think, code, or propose.  They always do exactly what  they want to be doing at any given moment.  Those guys can sling code too, at any time, to implement whatever policy they want.  "But what will they do" is FUD and a tactic to hinder progress, whether consciously embraced or not.  Nobody knows or can predict the future.  However, what they are saying they are likely or might do is of course valuable input to the decision process.

Well it wasn't at the tip of her tongue.  I had to remind her that it was "digital cash".  She then nodded knowingly and said "that's not going to catch on".
I usually ask at stores if people take bitcoin.  I don't expect them to.  I started doing it more as an opportunity to educate for those with interest.  What I was surprised at is the number of people that know about it.
For those working the register, they usually say "No. {pause} But that would be cool!"  When I've had a small business owner's ear, the answer has been consistent - "I am familiar with it. I hear it isn't doing well (from the news).  And besides, I want cash!"  When I then try to continue the discussion, I can sense that they have already shutdown on the topic.  They are closed.  
It is harder to change someone's opinion.  It is much easier to cultivate a green field, where the person knows nothing about the topic.

I think the problem is simpler.  In the risks benefit analysis, there are clearly too many perceived risks vs the perceived benefits.
I recently had my hair cut and asked the young lady if they accepted bitcoin.  Once reminded what bitcoin was, she said no, and that she was fairly certain that it would never catch on.  I asked why she thought that and had no answer.
For her, the topic is a non-starter.  There would be little appeal to her, from what I perceive to be her daily concerns.
They say the teacher appears when the student is ready.  Bitcoin is missing the killer app that grabs the attention of the average person.  
Bitcoin and all it offers will not cause bitcoin to take off.  It will be the killer app that requires bitcoin.
I don't know that that killer app might be, but it will be something that young adults care about.

Yes, I can easily imagine the case where the support guy is waiting on information to pass along from engineering.  It is so easy to get caught up in addressing the problem, and sending a "we're working on it" message isn't fun.  It's much more fun to send a "fixed!" message.  So they work with another customer... then another.  And the issue becomes a bit stale with little communication back to the customer while it is being worked on.   Exceptional customer support organizations address this meta problem.

Offended isn't the right word.  I speak with some people that are technical, curious about technology, and capable of understanding it, yet they make excuses for why they aren't getting involved "now". 
They might be financially risk averse.  One in particular, I happen to know is just stupid when it comes to money.   But I think it is more than that.  I think it is related to something intrinsic in human nature.
They are afraid of failure.  They are risk averse.  They are afraid of being wrong, almost more than anything.  Even if it costs them in the long run.  
They are not trail blazers.  They are not leaders.  They are followers.  They won't convert until the world converts them.
I've even tried to gift them.  No go.  That tells me it really isn't about their money being at risk.  It is about them being exposed, and being wrong.  
How do we convert these people?

But most caches will provide old information.  That's what they do.  It is typical for an application to invalidate caches when the information changes, or for a cache to refresh after a timeout.  That's how they work.
Caches are also frequently used in financial applications, because our banking system is so old they frequently display invalid cached information.  We are just so accustomed to it, that we accept it.  "Oh, that check I deposited still hasn't cleared."  What does that mean?  It is still in process.  It should be reflected in the balance (and sometimes is), much as a bitcoin transaction in-flight is acknowledged.
Go check out the balance of your 401k online.  It'll likely tell you that the balance is accurate as of some date.  That is cached data.  How much do you owe on your mortage?  You can't even get access to the true balances without calling.  The values you see are ALWAYS cached values.
I think you know what you are talking about; you can only say so much in one line.  I'm sure you were thinking of transaction systems.   This response isn't so much about your answer as to highlight how antiquated our systems are.
As for Mongodb, I think the biggest issue is its ability to scale given its locking model.
TLDR - We often see cached data in today's financial systems that don't reflect our true balances.  We're just used to it.

Two quick things from personal experience:

2) My friend was out and about without a wallet, but had the phone.  Was supporter easy to send bitcoins.

I was asked for same for a $1 credit card purchase.
Initially the transaction was approved and my account was credited.  A few days later when I logged in the "lastest activity" displayed that the transaction had failed due to "fraud detection".
What is interesting to me is that I had earlier made a larger purchase using the same method and there were no issues.
I understand the KYC regulations, but I'm not ok with them telling me that the transaction is good and then backing it out after the fact.  
The irony is that I was using this small transaction to create screen captures demonstrating how great and easy the service is.
I say tread lightly until they work things out.  I'm still a believer.

I was going to donate to DWB the other day, on the heels of having just donated to Wikipedia.  My donation to Wikipedia via bitcoin was incredibly easy.
I was on my phone and didn't have a credit card.  Maybe there is a way to mail them "cash".
Point of the matter is that if they accepted BTC, they'd have money from me at this moment.  In fact, because of the circumstances and their not accepting BTC, they don't.
Update: Writing this was a good reminder to donate, and I am on a computer.  And you know what, I don't have my credit card with me!   Cash is just fine when it is convenient.  It isn't always convenient, and in fact, I think they only accept credit cards.  I'll get that donation off to them soon...

@_date: 2015-01-27 22:46:53
We currently don't exactly have this situation, but I do agree with your observation.  The difference is that should the gov't introduce their own digital coin, then the gov't digital coin could have a number of benefits of bitcoin.  Namely cheap transfer of value from one person to another.  There are a number of people that won't touch bitcoin because they think it is "fake" and has no real value.  Those same people might start using gov't coin rather than bitcoin.  Whether it would be a gateway currency, and they'd in time start using bitcoin, or whether they'd just stick with gov't coin, who knows?  Probably a mix.
In any case, I think that the introduction of gov't coin is a certainty.  I have no idea what that timeline might be.  At present, I kind of hope I'm dead before it happens, and I have no death wish.

Point taken.  Not one of us can accurately predict the future.  My concern is about the timeline needed to react, which is why I advocate increasing the hard-limit, even if a soft-limit of 1M continues to be maintained.
To be successful as *I* define success for bitcoin, we need a system that can scale while maintaining small tx fees.

A higher fee will jump those that are spamming but a point canbe reached wherethe actual volume of people that care about their transactions being commited, regardless of fee,  exceeds capacity. Based on the test,  that value is extremely low for a global network. I believe that induction would show that the required fee in such a scenario is infinite. We need a better solution than "higher fees".  Fees alone don't address the problem of scale.

Personal preferences aside, this makes a lot of sense to me.  
The central banks get their coins and associated control.  Those that want government backing, feel safer in dealing with it, and begin to use.  It is legal tender and usable to pay taxes.

There is a market for exchange between all of the coins.

Your fair game doesn't look so fair to me.  All you're doing is creating another set of chips, and handing out the majority to your set of friends.  Sure, I can do some work to get some for myself, but the amount of work I have to do is much greater now than what you and your friends had to do.  Yes, your system is more fair, but I wouldn't say it is completely fair.  
Why am I being penalized for showing up late to the game?  A game that I've only just learned about.  
Oh, you say if I don't like it, I can start a game at my own table?  And I can manage the chips however I want?  Well, your table won't abandon your game because you like that you are sitting on a stack of chips.  The same goes for the original game where the chip holders like their chip distribution.  
If I create my own table, all I am doing is creating another group of empowered chip holders.  Yet another group at another table that controls the majority of chips that can shove new players around the table.  
I can see why you are excited about your game, but as a new arrival - meh.  Yes, it looks better than the first table, but in the long run, I don't see that it's going to work out much differently for me.

I'm happy to report that both coinbase and my bank (Chase) immediately asked for the authorization, so lawnmower is using the 3rd party APIs.
The bank I connected is a credit card only, so I feel I have more protection there.
Coinbase is TFA, so I am protected there are well.
Even though they are using the vendor APIs, Lawnmower could be doing a man in the middle attack, so I immediately changed my associated passwords.
As someone else suggested, I wish the would up the threshold for purchases to minimize fees.  They do have a multiplier on the "change".  Right now, they purchase at $4.

I have seen the red cross be a godsend for those who lost their homes to fire. They are there and provided the resources and organization that provided much needed stability during a crisis. I am happy for that even if it is a for profit organization, which I know they are not,  at least legally. 
I have known many that have worked for their blood collection services and at least locally,  it was run as a for profit business and the employees were treated with a factory mentality. It was shameful. I will never donate blood via the red cross again. 
The red cross is a large organization and the management might differ from one place to another but I believe most would be surprised to learn how the organization is run behind the scenes. Without a doubt they do some great much needed work but they are not fueled by compassion alone. This is an organization that is money driven. 
I prefer to donate to other organizations that are better managed and driven to deliver a higher percentage directly to the intended but in some cases no other charity can "bring it" like the red cross. In the case of large disasters such as Nepal has suffered,  it might be that a donation to the red cross is going to have the most positive impact because of the scale even if every dollar doesn't make it to ground zero.

Consider an ELI5 analogy:
Goal: I have $20 I want to give to you, but over a person of 10 years.  I also want to give you most of it earlier in the period.
I decide to give you certain amounts each year using the following schedule:
YR     AMOUNT
 * 1    $5
 * 2    $4
 * 3    $3
 * 4    $2
 * 5    $1
 * 6    $1
 * 7    $1
 * 8    $1
 * 9    $1
 * 10   $1
In the example above, $20 will be given in total, but more than half ($12) during the first 3 years.

As a seller of BTC, I'm not sure it is a good idea.  Love the idea of purse.io but if someone is using a stolen credit card to make the purchase, then the cops show up at the address that the items were shipped.    
I think it is fine for a buyer though...

Buffet is consistent.  He doesn't believe in asset classes such as precious medals.  He chooses to invest in things that "work" for him and return a dividend.  Why have a nugget of gold that just sits there and maybe appreciates, when you can instead own a stake in a company that might not only appreciate, but can be a source of income along the way?  Hope I didn't do his view an injustice with my summation.

Same age.  Had the CoCo.  Can't remember if the memory was 16K, 32K, or 64k.  Am I even in the right ballpark?
What was great about the CoCo was -- the color of course, but that it seemed a bit of a game machine too.  It had cartridges - project Nebula comes to mind.  But I think I remember buying games on cassette tape in 8.5x11 inch bags with a single page cover sheet.  Bedlam.  Had to first load them via Bload.  Fun times...

Amazon handed out $10 codes too in the early days.  I had no idea what they were.  Why would I want to order a book online when I could leaf through one on the shelves at B&amp;N and bring it home that night?  They got my attention and first purchase with that $10.

Nothing is as treasured as a light bulb moment.  People highly value realizations that they come upon themselves.  Let us not force the horse to drink, but instead, lead the horse to the water, and let the horse decide for itself by asking the simple questions:
Should a bank control your purchases, or should you?
Should government define its people's interests, or should it reflect the interests of the people?
I don't know what serious of questions make the most sense, or might prove the most enlightening, but I'd love it if we had some go to, eye opening questions that could simply embody some principles many of us seem to share.

While SI units might be correct, the term 'bits' seems to be becoming more popular.  One bit is equal to one μBTC, but by taking bits to two decimal places, we extend to satoshis and encounter a familiar notation where 0.01 is one satoshi.  This is comfortable for many were the smallest unit occupies the hundredths position.  It is also easy to remember that the base unit of a 1 bitcoin is 1 million bits.
For example:
* 0.01 bits =  1 satoshi (smallest unit currently supported)
* 1,000 bits = 0.001 BTC
* 10,000 bits = 0.01 BTC
* 100,000 bits = 0.1 BTC 
* 1,000,000 bits = 1 BTC
* 10,000,000 bits = 10 BTC

I suspect that many are slowly loading their personal wallets before ushering in the masses.
@_date: 2013-11-17 23:58:34
You are likely right.  I do wonder what the fallout will be.  From a practical standpoint, one should keep their holdings distributed across multiple addresses.  But with such a crash, each of those addresses might in the end be holding zippo in value after a collision and not because the coins have been lifted.

When?  No one knows.
BTC has been a public technology from the start.  What we see now is the growth curve usually only seen behind doors by VCs before a company goes public.  Like you, so many people are coming with the mentality of trading a public company.  So there will be sell-offs, but the equivalent of VCs, those that believe in a much higher valuation, will jump in.  There corrections are good for the long term prospects for growth.
Some of those corrections will be painful.

Yes, XBT will flourish as a currency when prices have stabilized.  People will then be able to transact in XBT without immediately converting to fiat.  Additionally, people will then be able to begin thinking about product/service prices in terms of XBT.  Exciting times ahead.  I expect it to be a long and exciting road.

Here is a fun thing to do that means nothing. Taking your numbers as fact for US, if each of those 313M people each had an equal share of those US dollars, they'd each have $3.7K.
Equating that dollar value to the equivalent BTC share of 0.067 would put the value of 1 BTC at $55.7K.
This calculation is pretty much meaningless, but I find it fun.

Sorry - I should have indicated sarcasm.  We in the US never transitioned, even thought everyone in my generation was only taught metric.  We sometimes see metric listed next to our (imperial?) system, but it is ignored by all natives.
My point is that for legs to grow strength, they need to stand on their own.  I believe prices should be listed in BTC units if that is where we want to go.  Provide crutches for those that are learning, but if you lead with non-BTC unit, there is no motivation to switch.   Human nature.
