You're right. It isn't. I got my figures mixed up. 
A majority of households live with $7-10k credit card debt, and $30k student loan debt, going by last year's Federal Reserve statistics. 
You have my apologies for spreading misinformation.

I got my numbers mixed up. Really sorry about that.
These are the actual numbers, from the Federal Reserve last year. It's still bad, but not as bad. 
Again, really sorry. I'll check my numbers before posting in the future.

Oh no, it's most certainly an actual currency. Or, rather, it's a currency vehicle for investment purposes (and illicit uses, but we don't talk about those). 
It's got a centralized issuing authority, exchanges to convert it to and from a backing currency, and a standard value system that keeps it from being a stagnant container (A bond, more or less.)
It's most certainly a currency, in the same way Dinar or Aureus is a currency. However, it acts as a vehicle for other currencies, and not strictly a currency in and of itself. It's also similar to the way EBT credits are considered a currency in certain impoverished communities, so chew on that for a bit.

Well, I'm not a member of the The Neckbeard Alliance of Teenage Atheists... I don't have a neckbeard, I'm not allied with anyone, and I'm not an atheist. I'm just a dumb kid who spends too much time on Reddit.

Certainly. Last year's Federal Reserve statements.
However, I made a slight mistake, which I would like to rectify.. That's the average student loan debt, not credit card debt. My apologies.

Really? A runaway currency skyrocketing out of control, and we never thought it was going to crash? 
That's the textbook definition of naïveté!

It's true! Over 90% of our adult population lives with $30k in credit card debt. 
That's a testament to not knowing how to handle money, and living outside our means. Problem is, when the country's based on habits like that, it's difficult to think differently.

We all knew it was going to crash eventually, right? I mean, I was honestly wondering how high it could go before it went sailing back down... And this crash was a case of market manipulation through DDoS, so there's no telling how high it would have gotten had this not been the case.

It's kind of interesting how so many "currency investors" who invest in Bitcoin know nothing about currency investment vehicles, such as Bitcoin...

Ah, yes. The subreddit was very, very ignorant about the market's impending collapse. That's the nature of Reddit, though, isn't it? 
I'm an outside speculator, I don't actually trade. Still yet, I saw this crash coming months ago, and I believe I've made several statements saying it probably wouldn't make it over $200 before a market collapse. I still wonder how high it would have gone if circumstances hadn't transpired as they did.

The entire reason education is getting more expensive is because student loans are getting bigger. The bigger student loans get, the more of that money the school wants, so they increase prices... And student loans go up again, to cover it. It's a vicious cycle.

It's also what caused the Great Depression. 
It's never a good idea to buy stocks with money you don't own.

Sorry, I don't really follow the subreddit. I don't really do the whole Bitcoin investment thing either. I'm just an economic spectator who likes speculating. 
@_date: 2013-04-11 18:55:47
It was, by what I've read, a small group of investors who dumped all their bitcoin at once, then used a botnet-based DDoS to cripple the exchange until their transaction was complete. 
It wasn't an inside job, but it was criminal, and showcases the flaws in the current system. 
@_date: 2013-04-12 01:44:46
I'm not sure, that's just what I read... The Verge? TechCrunch? The Economist? Don't know. If I find the article again, I'll link it to you.

I'd be surprised if the market didn't rebound within a couple weeks. It's a rapid growth investment like any other, and can be treated similarly to incredibly volatile companies on the NYSE.

Oh, I'm well aware that many people have no other option than to take out a loan, or a card, or go into debt for their day-to-day. That's what a majority of Americans do, even.
That doesn't make it right, of course. It also doesn't make it sustainable. And it's certainly not the only solution, but it's often the easiest one. And, sure, it can be argued that it's also not entirely a bad thing. Until you don't pay your bills, you keep borrowing, and you never work on getting out of your hole of ever-deepening debt.

The only question is when... Honestly, I hope it pops soon... But again, when the housing bubble burst, we went headfirst into a recession that's still not lifted... I wonder the damage the education bubble could cause.
