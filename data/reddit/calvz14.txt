Who else would be in your top 5? I’m a bit newer to the space and it would great to have more articles of this caliber to source knowledge from. Thanks

I actually thought you misspelled that for a second.

Wow, thank you so much ���� the technical stuff is awesome. I have been looking into and have recently taken a stab at a implementing Schnorr as outlined in Pieter Wuille’s BIP.  Wanted to add in a Pay-To-Contract/Taproot (Aaron’s article on the topic is quite good) like feature or maybe take a look at MuSig next. 
Having access to more in depth information on the latest stuff here and for things like lightning network routing will be really helpful in tinkering around with stuff I want to try and implement. 
I will anxiously await Aaron’s reply your tweet. Thanks again.

I believe as it stands right now the 2/2 multisig required to open a standard lightning channel hits the blockchain as a Pay To Script Hash (has an identifying address format) and then the full script (which contains the public keys of the parties involved) must be revealed at channel close. 
With Schnorr and a scheme like MuSig, instead of using a script which specifies the multi signature, you can instead lock funds to a public key formed by combining the public key of each party. Funds locked to the combined public key can be spent by construction of a combined signature (this represents the collaborative channel close). But don’t pay to this combined public key just yet. Instead tweak the key and “mix in” a commitment to your script that contains all the non-collaborative channel logic (time locks/fund recovery). Then, finally pay to the hash of this tweaked public key. 
End Result: All multisig and script based transactions hit the chain with the same form as a normal Pay To Public Key Hash (P2PKH). When channels are closed collaboratively the data on chain looks no different than any signature you’d see for any other transaction. If you need the fallback case to save you in the event the other party misbehaves, it’s there.

POS means "piece of shit" rather than Proof Of Stake in this case right? Just to clarify ��

I understand most of this part, but how do nodes "get" the merkle path/branch for each transaction in order to verify its inclusion in the tree? Where is the path information stored? 
Edit: it sounds like the merkle path is calculated when requested by a client rather than being stored. Not totally sure how this provides the benefit of faster look up time. Perhaps the path can be calculated in a clever way.

Good questions. I have tried to think of some answers to this myself. The best I’ve been able to come up with regarding taxation is that Bitcoin is not a replacement for a legal system. The government will need to (continue to) require that companies report the salaries of their employees so that they can accurately calculate any given person’s tax liability for the year. While they might not be able to see every transaction every individual makes (a good thing imo), they can still come down on you with legal action should you not save enough to cover your tax liability at years end. 
On this topic I think it really wouldn’t be too much different than a return to a pre-internet, cash dominant society (prior to the 90s). Government instituted personal income tax sometime around 1913 and although I can’t say for certain how effective they were in collecting this tax, they were at least able to accomplish collecting on some level.

One day after I downloaded a 3rd of his entire series of shows. Eerie

Another point worth making is that Bitcoin never needs to achieve the transaction throughput of VISA to be an immensely valuable network.  
It could be the case that BTC doesn't get its primary utility from consumer payments, but rather as the best store of value, or from cross-border, near realtime international settlement.
Layer 1 transactions (those recorded on blockchain) will likely become way too valuable to use for small scale transactions. This is where layer 2 solutions like Lightning are awesome. 
It will be awesome to see BTC compete but it does not need to beat centralized payment networks in order to change the world. 
For comparison, gold is not used for small scale transactions and has a market size of 3 trillion globally by conservative estimates.

Sounds like a greedy solution. That's what I was thinking as well. 
So perhaps just maintain the mempool in some type of sorted fashion by value (maybe a max heap) and then just extract the max values as you fill your block. Hmmm. I'll look into it. 
Appreciate the response.

Could you ELI5 this? Is it essentially people with a short position getting called to pay? If so wouldn't something like an extremely large buy have needed to raise the price triggering the call in the first place? I'm somewhat of a noob when it comes to the short side of things. Thanks ����

Actually laughed out loud ��

So some body with fat stacks came in and started buying which got all the short sellers margin called ?
EXCELLENT. Appreciate the detailed response
