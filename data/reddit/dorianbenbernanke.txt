UBC adds a parallel chain for lite nodes. It does not offer a way to make transactions that are not on the main chain; full nodes have to see the same thing as lite nodes.

It's a security risk to put that many coins in a hot wallet. So separate it into different wallets only makes sense

It's not a question of the software existing, it's a property of the mathematics. To generate a particular address, unless the hash function has an enormous undiscovered flaw (not to mention the surprising properties that would have to be found for secp256k1 ECDSA), you'd need to try numbers of numbers greater than you can imagine.

Most modern hardware gets at least 1 Ghash/joule. At the US average of $0.12/kWh, this works out to 3×10^16 hashes/$. At the current difficulty of 5×10^9, it takes on average 2.15×10^19 hashes to find a block. Thus it currently costs about $715 in electricity to mine a block. At the current block reward of 25 BTC, Bitcoin would need to fall below about $30/BTC for mining to become unprofitable for miners with 1Ghash/joule hardware and average electric rates. Of course, this is just looking at the immediate effects of a sudden price crash; under such circumstances mining profitability would recover somewhat after the next difficulty adjustment, with only the lowest energy efficiency miners shutting down permanently.
So even if the exchange rate crashed suddenly and severely, it would be unlikely to disrupt mining.

Standard credit card swipers operate on plain magnetic-stripe cards, which can only work by giving up your private key and so aren't capable of realizing most of the benefits of bitcoin.

I'm not sure what you're taking about. You should never share a private key under any circumstances; doing so fails the first word of private key.

That's actually a myth Litecoin dealers instigated by defining the come-up as happening sooner, despite very similar pharmacokinetics.

The alt chain is a summary of the main chain; it is *generated from* it. Nothing is ever moved from the alt chain to the main chain, except for the single header used to implement merged mining.

Off-chain transactions are not bitcoin, they are internal accounting. They lack nearly all the benefits of bitcoin, and are a good way to get yourself goxed.


If you reread the OP, you'll notice that the block reward doesn't figure in to the estimates given. If you're suggesting that half the hashing power will leave the network when the reward halves, you're predicting a catastrophe (the bitcoin difficulty doesn't adjust well to large dropoffs in hashing power) based on poor understanding of economics.


This is true, more transactions don't substantially increase mining costs; increase in transaction volume is the only thing that can solve our problem.


Web wallets are an ugly part of bitcoin history, but are used a lot less than they used to be (mercifully). Decentralized, trustless, off-chain transactions can't really be done through bitcoin, though Open-Transactions comes close and seems like it could integrate well into the bitcoin ecosystem. Ultimate Blockchain Compression has nothing to do with off-chain transactions.

The Free Exercise clause specifies that no law can be written specifically to apply to your religion; you'd have a hard time arguing the tax laws your religion conflicts with were written in anticipation of your religion's existence.
