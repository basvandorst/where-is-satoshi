I made money in the dotcom boom in high school.  I mined bitcoins, forgot about them, and sold 1500 of them at the height of the bubble.. I still have ~~1500~~ 820 left (bitfinex drama).  I run a very successful bitcoin analytics company.  Three months ago I bought $50k of CPXX stock when they were $1/share, when they were bought out I bought a plane.  And I literally took my wife out to lunch at the next state over.  I don't have to impress any 18 year olds.
Again, I know full and well who the CFTC are.  You don't seem to understand the terms of the agreement they came to.

Oh I fully understand.  I have recommended in countless threads and it doesn't click with anyone to actually seek advice to know their options.  Personally I think, unless they come out in surprise bankruptcy, they are playing with fire.  In my case, I have a pretty good claim for my entire funding amount.  By nature this means someone else will collect a larger haircut.  If its because they didn't report the problem, then I could really care less.

Why the need for insults?  We were having a friendly conversation.  Why don't you stand in front of a street paver and try to collect pennies instead of assuming the person you are talking to is a redneck that makes 20k a year.

DId you miss how OP didn't get anything for his judgement when they went bankrupt?  Okay keep that in mind, because I don't think you understand how debt is structured in a limited liability company nor how bankruptcy works.  If you sue for $50k and get a judugement of $50k, that is a lower percentage of total debt than if you sued for $150k and got that judgement instead.  When bankruptcy comes around they will pay out to those who had judgements first, then secured creditors then unsecured creditors.  
In the bankruptcy proceeds, if you hold a smaller total % of debt, you will be forced a larger haircut down to 0% like did.  This is why a common tactic for attorneys is to sue for 3x the amount so you can negotiate down the judgement during bankruptcy.  That way maybe OP would have gotten 5% of his judgement.  
Does that make sense to you now or are you going to keep up with the snarky responses to topics you obviously have no clue about?

in my country it was not illegal nor unlicensed.  bitfinex is not our customer so i am not aware of their coin movements.  we do have a tiger team working on a historical analysis of the blockchain but it is currently limited to supporting the loss of our funds.  if we find information that law enforcement may find useful we, as always, turn over the information.

Okay so you lack at reading comprehension.  We will not be interacting anymore.  Good day.
For anyone else following along (and wishing to verify by xposting to you don't get a binding judgement for more than the actual loss *when it goes to trial*.  When you are negotiating you can actually settle for a higher amount than just the actual loss if you include things such as attorney fees, lost wages/income, pain and suffering etc.  When you present your case in a trial and both sides argue their points, no judge would  grant a judgement more than your actual loss.  Where is being deceptive is that if you went to trial and the other side did not show up then you are awarded the entire judgement even if its greater than your actual loss.  Because.. you know, the defendant has to argue why higher judgement number is not fair.. no defendant no argument and only the plantiff's word matters.
What is completely clueless about is that in a bankruptcy proceeding, it doesn't matter what your actual loss is.  You are not arguing whether the claim is valid when you are in bankruptcy.. the exact nature of bankruptcy means all claims are valid and you are trying to settle them so you can continue business.  So the bankruptcy court needs to settle the (in this example) $150k.  Maybe there are only $1m in assets and $2m in liabilities.  Your $150k claim is a greater percentage than your $50k claim.  That percentage could mean the difference between getting 0% like or at least some money back such as 5% of your claim.  I'm sure would be happier with $2.5k rather than $0.

Karpeles was in talks with the DOJ for a year before MtGox collapsed and no one knew anything until Ulbright got arrested.  Don't be surprised if international law enforcement is involved.

that is less than 5% of what I have in investment accounts.  that is a little more than 10% of the value of my home.  that is about the same amount remaining on my car loans.  that is the same amount as a credit line on a single credit card in my wallet.  
i won't talk about my business bank accounts that have 3x that amount.
if my identity is being questioned, i do not want my financial institution authorizing anything without me being there in person.  this is why your established banks have multiple branch locations and a strict a set of policies and procedures they all follow.  to ensure the security around the fucked up rules that the various politicians, which you all voted for might i add, have set in place.
EDIT: also what secured credit card do you have that your cc company won't overnight air a credit card to you?  when i lost my wallet on a plane at 10pm, amex concierge services booked a hotel room for me and had a replacement card waiting for me at the front desk by 8am.  it sounds like it's time to step up your game and stop worrying about the bitcoin revolution and secure your own financial future.

your understanding appears to be in your head.  so the appearance may not be accurate in your head, just as it appears the economy is getting better -- yet we cannot raise interest rates.  so i'm awaiting your source as well.
otherwise, since there is no source for what is in your head, i will just point out the 70% of internet traffic that is streaming (read: youtube, hulu, pornhub, etc) and that bittorrent is not included in that number.  bittorrent's usage is increasing just as i explain in my original post. blizzard has incorporated bittorrent into their installation client.  openstack/vmware supports bittorrent for image retrieval, steam for installing as well.  so yes bittorrent usage is increasing but not for it's original use case (pirated movie downloading).  all i am saying is that bitcoin may not grow in the way you are expecting (MOONSHOT TO REPLACE ALL THE CURRENCIES)

So you don't think that a bank working on bitcoin and other cryptographic systems to be innovation?  what the fuck is the point of bitcoin then (and yes the last banks I worked for had trials of bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies in a lab environment working with their existing systems as well as banks doing some pretty cool things with big data).

@_date: 2015-12-13 20:06:36
your counter example is one you state of your own.  i am waiting for corroboration from a validated external source.  you cannot provide one because none exist.  however i can point out the events leading up to and including nixon shock ([here is a link to reading so you can understand what happened]( be sure to also read about the [bretton woods system which is exactly what your counter example is](  long story short,  countries went off the gold standard because of exactly what i stated.  the us and other rich countries could just hold their money and become even richer while everyone else was spending all of their reserves going broke.  so every other country went off the gold backing to build up their reserves.  the united states were the last country and they were forced to because their reserves started dropping as other countries were allowed to float against the usd.

Aka venmo, apple pay, rebit, google pay, visa, etc.
Money transmitter businesses are all closed-loop ledgers which must adhere to strict regulations.  Whatever they use on the backend is perfectly legal (and bitcoin works well here because it has built in accounting) as long as they follow MSB regs (make sure you're not a turrorist).  This is why bitcoin is useful, it allows ANYONE to be a money transmitter.  What people fail to grasp is that bitcoin alone is not the entire part of the equation.  They need to make money too, and if apple pay and visa are doing it cheaper with an easy to use platform, then expecting your user to learn bitcoin and acquire them through shady means to lower your costs means no one will use your platform.
This is why banks have interest in bitcoin on the backend (pawn off the ledger work to poor saps that offer their electricity and compute power for free) but almost no one has any interest in using bitcoin in the frontend (doubly so if you look at all the negative press bitcoin receives for things such as malware, hacks, drugs, and exchange failures)

Kind of like torrents right?  The govs shut down the centralized kazaa's, limewire's, and piratebays.   So bittorrent was created as the decentralized fileshare.  Except hulu, netflix, etc. stepped in and suddenly no one needs bittorrent anymore.
The technology is still used in many places (steam, battle.net, openstack) but it's been made transparent and only to increase the user experience.  Will bitcoin follow the same saga?  Only time will tell, but remember it took govs a few years to motivate and destroy napster, winmx, aimster, etc

You don't think Saddam provided stability?  Gadaffi?  When these tyrannous leaders were removed look at the first thing that disappeared.  If you think the Arab Spring was so stable, lets look at Egypt, why is the Army pretty much running the country?  Did you miss all of the IEDs that magically appeared and shiite vs sunni mosque bombings that started *the day after* Saddam was hanged?  Because that shit didn't happen every day under Saddam.  He would find you, murder your family and torture you.  But hey it was entirely unstable and lawless since there was no peace!!
Think about what happens when Assad out of the picture, they can implement a sock puppet which won't go and launch chemical weapons in genocide which creates freedom fighters who eventually become terrorists.  
I mean do you just think stability means peace or do you actually subscribe to the meaning of stability can only be achieved with peace.  Because Israel is stable but it sure as shit ain't peaceful on the westbank.


The fact that you do keep shifting goal posts and changing stories and refuse to address my statement that "Saddam saying he will sell oil for euros" is just as fabricated as "Saddam has WMDs" means you have lost the argument and you have resorted to equating stablity to peace so you may argue a point i do not care to talk about.

Lehman, Bear and Merrill were not banks.  They were investment firms that died because they were peddling the bad investments.  The investments washed up and they owed people money.  The banks bought them (Chase, BoA, etc) because for them it was pennies on the dollar.  However the banks did not start buying these firms until the government forced bank of america to merge with Merrill Lynch (remember Lehman Bros collapsed entirely).  
GSA denied banks from packaging known bad loans as investment vehicles.  Credit-debt swaps is an example of a bad loan investment that has nothing to do with banks and escaped the language of GSA (and the new dodd frank act).  Selling a package of subprime mortgages that the banks knew were bad is an example .  The removal of GSA enabled banks to legally do this.
Let me repeat, the subprime mortgage did not cause the problem.  Investors buying these loans thinking they were all A+ loans is what caused the problem.  GSA would not have let these investors purchase said loans.

That is not how loans work.  They do not create money out of thin air, they loan out money they have that others have lent to them (a checking account is called a **share account** because it is *shared* with the bank).  The money that "comes out of thin air" is from those that pay it back.  This manifests itself in the form of inflation^[1] which the government monitors and implements controls to reduce inflation (print additional dollars if too little in circulation or buys back the dollars if too much in circulation)
This is banking 101 and [any freshman econ major](can politely explain to you.
[1]-e.g. mcdonalds took out a loan to pay for their latest whooper sandwich R&amp;D, it costs them $1m in interest.  they raise the price of the whopper by 5 cents, which gives them the loan money plus $1m in interest. that 5 cent raise is inflation

Actually the banks do not want these crazy policies.  You have witnessed it with the repeal of glass-stegall which the banks lobbied for (wahoo less policies! more financial destruction!).  Instead you have freedom and patriot act senators and congressmen and left and right wing political pundents that push for these crazy KYC/AML policies to prevent "terrorism".  You know, after a whopping 3000 people were killed by a terrorist act.  Go TSA!
Yet we still allow anyone to drink and get behind a wheel of a car contributing to the 3000 deaths **per year** without a single s.o.b.e.r. act passing through the house or the senate or the executive privilege of the president.  Democracy at it's finest.
But keep telling yourself that it's the banks that want more burden and more costs chipping away at their profits.  That's some really fine logic there

If you just purchased the item with a credit card in the first place, you get chargeback protection.  At the same time, you can purchase the equivalent fiat amount in bitcoins from (eg lbc, circle, or other) bitcoin exchanges .
TL;DR: why do automatic rebuy when you can purchase with a cc and buy bitcoins at the same time.  that way you get (chargeback, fraud protection, airline points, etc) benefits of a cc and still hodl bitcoins. but then bitcoin merchants stop accepting bitcoins.  bitcoin plummets in price and usability.

no this is how SMTP works. [Read the RFC](
you are connecting to the endpoint and delivering mail to the endpoint.  the recipient can be anywhere *because smtp was not meant to be authoritative per the RFC*.  somewhere between 1995 and 1999 (the early internet) SMTP became the defacto protocol rather than actually improving it.

I work in oil, not the us government.  The us government has a vested interest in seeing it's currency proliferate through the world (but so does every government).  Guess who spends a lot of USD?  The oil companies.  
WIth that said, we do not work directly in USD but we build out all of our estimates and costs in USD, even if we are accepting oil from OPEC, Russia, Turkey, etc.  Why?  Because USD is the accepted world reserve currency. (This should answer your question about why the us is prepared to go to war to protect the USD, because it is a position of power).
USD is used to determine the price we buy and sell oil at, but it is not used directly.  My company will not accept a check or wire transfer of $50m.  That is just not realistic.  But we have financial employees who will manage the transfer of a $50m asset.
You know who buys our oil from us and pays with wire transfers/checks?  Small independent gas stations.  Hell even Exxon, Shell, etc. *manages oil delivery costs for their franchise locations*.  The owner just deducts the cost from their profits and wire transfers (there's the action you were looking for even though it's usually ACH initiated by the franchise parent) back to the parent company.
The amount of actually USD in oil is very minimal, but because USD is used *everywhere else*, oil is priced out in USD.  Next are you goign to tell me that we shouldn't label our oil barrels as a barrel and switch to Liters because reasons?  
so my point still stands, you have no f- clue what you are talking about.  would you like to come to my office and learn more?  i can setup a day of meetings and our team can explain this to you as an interested investor

problems with your statement.
* inflation has been steadily occuring every year at roughly 2%.  so it's been whistling and apparently we are seeing the best of fiat money right now (citation: [MIT]( [BLS](
* prior to the fdic, banks just closed.  the last time banks were too big to fail, jp morgan took over (citation: [panic of 1907](
* here we find ourselves again with banks being too big to fail, after we, the people, voted to remove the regulations which prevented banks from becoming too big to fail (citation: [glass-stegall act of 1936](
money, while being the central issue, is not the problem here.  the problem are the politicians we vote into office.  until we change this, we will not solve this problem :(  for instance, we are trillions of dollars in debt due to wars, healthcare and tax cuts... but this is not so all i can do is point out what has happened to finance in history and hope we the people can make the connection

I was with you up to this paragraph.  Banks are highly innovative, you should go work on the IT side of a bank sometime.  You will be surprised at what they are working on.  Uber is not displacing the taxi system, it is just another player in the taxi game.  Bitcoin is not displacing the financial system, it is just another player in the financial game.  And it is not doing a good job considering that every Apple|Samsung|Verizon|Walmart Pay system is bypassing it.  That said bitcoin has it's niche which will not be replaced, but it is in no way a threat to financial companies.  If anything the companies will use it along side their already existing products.
SO once again, this system is this way for many reasons.  You do not wish to actually study the history behind all of the actions leading to today so you can  just knee-jerk respond with a simple one liner such as


you have no idea what will give or why.  you just see your bank account not going up as fast as you would like and blame others for not being able to sit around and twiddle your thumbs as you make money like your parents or grandparents did.   THAT system had to give, it was not sustainable, and it is giving right now.  We are returning to the standard of living that was common in the 1900s, low interest rates, service-based industries as the norm, etc.  Trust me, bro, I was once in your shoes.  You can either fight change or you can accept it.  I accepted it and now I am making $300k+/year.  I don't like the political system or banks anymore than you.  They have robbed me in more ways than one.  But I also see why they are robbing.  Because people like myself would not give anything back to those same insitutions which others actually depend on.  So I said that's okay.  You may not be able to get a job and you need welfare.  That's fine.  I will pay my taxes for that.  People need jobs, TSA needs warm bodies.  I'm okay with being groped when i get on a plane if it means more families can eat.  But I won't sit around and bitch and not do anything.  I am quietly amassing my fortune and then I will strike.  Until then, smile and be merry.  You could be somewhere worse.
Speaking of worse, you are also forgetting that there is the advent of technology. You know when the internet came around I thought it would be a boon for education.  Now millions of people could sit at home and become smarter with all the information at their fingertips, but no one predicted streaming video to take off the way it did.  Now the internet is an extension of consumable prerecorded content.  Yes it enables things like bitcoin, but the simple fact that you do not understand what brought the banking system to the way it is today and how intertwined it is with today's society shows that the internet, with its vast realms of information, has failed.  So please consider this as you age, bitcoin is not the platform that will correct everything.  
Bitcoin, if anything, reminds me a lot like gnutella.  A great idea but poorly conceived due to the nature of destruction.  It will evolve and advance into something we use on a more regular basis but will look very much like the current system we use today.  The only way to change this is with violence, which I do not think you (nor the rest of the country) are ready to accept.

Now we have the ability to make the change (not paying your way to win in traffic court as an example), maybe asking your mayor to change the law or petition your congressman/senator.

    ( ) Technically illiterate politicians
    ( ) Extreme stupidity on the part of people who do business with spammers
    ( ) Dishonesty on the part of spammers themselves
    ( ) Bandwidth costs that are unaffected by client filtering
    (X) Outlook
    and the following philosophical objections may also apply:
    (X) Ideas similar to yours are easy to come up with, yet none have ever been shown practical
    ( ) Any scheme based on opt-out is unacceptable
    ( ) SMTP headers should not be the subject of legislation
    ( ) Blacklists suck
    (X) Whitelists suck
    ( ) We should be able to talk about Viagra without being censored
    ( ) Countermeasures should not involve wire fraud or credit card fraud
    (X) Countermeasures should not involve sabotage of public networks
    ( ) Countermeasures must work if phased in gradually
    (X) Sending email should be free
    (X) Why should we have to trust you and your servers?
    ( ) Incompatiblity with open source or open source licenses
    ( ) Feel-good measures do nothing to solve the problem
    ( ) Temporary/one-time email addresses are cumbersome
    ( ) I don't want the government reading my email
    ( ) Killing them that way is not slow and painful enough

You are missing my point.  These investment firms you are talking about did not underwrite mortgages. They did not take their own underwritten mortgages and sell them to other investment firms.  They were the investment firms buying the mortgages and relabeling them as short-term A+ mortgages.  GSA does not prevent that.  The GSA prevented banks from selling them to investment firms as highly rated investment products.
The fact that they (investment firms and banks) are now housed under one roof means they cannot make those movements anymore without penalty of fines and jail time. In 2006, there were no penalties for the banks (mortgage underwriters) to sell to investment firms while knowing the investment firms were selling them as short term profitable investment vehicles.
You obviously did not read the PDF which clearly explains the provision of GSA which prevents *banks* from selling *certain securities* to *investment firms*

seriously, this is right about when policy changes were being made to support federal oversight of the banking system (i.e. the fed and their goal of maintaining 2-3% inflation).  if you do a similar report from 1815 (and even to/from 1865), you will find some serious inflation pointing at unregulated bankers doing corrupt and shady stuff which damaged the entire country.  hell the civil war was all about money and the north trying to inflate away their debt to the south.  the south continued slavery in defiance because their dollars were becoming worthless (they had to pay their slaves to pick cotton AND repay their loans at a higher rate? etc etc war)

No. they were not banks.  They were not FDIC insured.  They were not banks.  They were not regulated as banks and as such GSA, BSA, and other banking regulations were not applicable to them.   I will not say it again.


and thats why the government forced the purchase of merril lynch, because the fed realized the investment companies were acting as banks.  now they are part of a bank, they are subject to banking regulations.


exactly, so we both agree that the GSA did not prevent issues that were borne outside of banks.  the subprime packaging of loans as investment vehicles was not one of them.

When you withdraw your ChangeTip Dust (as OP is describing) now you are giving ChangeTip data mining gold as they can track your social and transactional history.
On one hand we should be amazed that technology like this exists.  It represents a huge cry from spacecraft powered by the equivalent of an 8088 to what we can do today.  On the other hand, the Big Brother aspects this creates is overwhelming to not take into consideration.
For that reason, I do not support ChangeTip and immediately "clean" my coins as soon as foreign matter breaches my frontline.  I hope we all heed OP's advice and I hope I have made it a little bit more clear of the potential dangers of supporting all bitcoin companies as even some of the best intentions in history have been proven to have a nefarious back or sidestory.
With that said.  The lightening network and even sidechains provide enough protection against this tracking.  We need to get Bitcoin 2.0 past the blocksize hurdle first, though...

it's a public ledger, you can investigate yourself to see where the coins come from.  that is the whole purpose of the trustless decentralized nature of bitcoin.  no longer do we have to hope the banks are monitoring donations to ensure there is no fraud.  this work can now be outsourced to anyone! you, or me, if we were so inclined!
you act as though a majority of mining is done by foreign entities.  bottom line is, if they can convict DPR based on his bitcoin movements then surely they can see when someone from Isreal or Japan sends Rand Paul bitcoin

ha i know.  but you know what everyone forgets about markets? is that you can make money both ways.  for instance, the fall from $1000 was actually very profitable for many people, especially as the btc shorting options increased.  i got on okchina and shorted 20x from ~$600.
everyone here is saying the us dollar and other fiat currencies are going to fail, so why not make some money while you're at it and buy volitility indexes? (personally i think it's because people are pumping btc but fully plan to cash back out to fiat if there is another spike)  Volitility being at an all time low, i purchased options which expire 7 months from now with a closing price of 40/share.  seemed a bit ridiculous while VIX was sitting at 15/share but that 45% jump makes my options look pretty valuable.  
so while i have not realized it yet, i can cash out and buy a new car now if i wanted (i will not, i think we have room for another 20% jump)

I fully agree, a lot of people who talk about the economy don't really know about the economy and make stuff up.  I mean you should hear some of these conversations I have with non economic majors (I got my phD in economics), they tend to just make up their own economic theories which hold zero value.  Sounds kind of like this.


Your government needs to control it's currency.  This is no different than USA firing drone missles into another country or China coming out with a new stealth mechanism for their submarines.  They need to keep their power (in this case, a good storage of value).  Sometimes their national citizens do stupid things (car manufacturers go belly up due to incompetence) or are bamboozled into stupid things (subprime loan crisis).  Then the same government must protect their citizens.  Devaluing their currency will protect everyone (not just a select few) against larger problems when done correctly.
Within all of that, you will still have a fringe outset of citizens who exploit the protections to increase their wealth. I believe this is the problem people have with devaluing of currency.  Realistically, macroeconomics proves that inflation is almost necessary since we as humans are constantly inflating.  At some point we need to balance the need for personal wealth and the continued growth of humanity (hodling money does nothing for me and everything for you).  For instance, here in America, we are at the crux of that balance shift (minimum wage almost doubling) as we have been growing personal/economic wealth for almost 20 years while ignoring the people who keep the country going. 


This is a very real problem and is called a Currency war.  We don't want war, but China also doesn't want America's dirty recyclables that China then needs to spend money on to put it back into production.  China has asked that we send only clean recyclables but to make sure we, America, understands this, China lowers their currency to increase the power of the USD (and lower the gains from exporting the crap from America).  Now China has a valid tactical hold against USA and USA must truly consider changing it's recycling practice.  This actual war I described, while entirely possible, has a lot more factors -- and the currency war is not to force america to recycle, but to force america (or any other country the war is/are between) into accepting the other country's monetary policy.
Then there is the issue about savings.  The idea behind fiat currency is you don't hoard it, you make money by putting it to work.  Investments make money.  The bagel shop you started makes money.  Your house makes money.  Your bank account does not make money.  On top of all of that, there are extremely low risk investments that will easily beat inflation (AT&amp;T comes to mind)


Bitcoin's utility is low.  There is a lot of risk in bitcoin which makes it dangerous.  There is no saying that bitcoin will be worth 50% what it is today in 10 years.  It is extremely unlikely that USD, EUR, CNY, etc will be 50% less in 10 years.  There is no saying that litcoin will take over bitcoin, etc.  That said, those who didn't invest partly in Apple, Pets.com, Netflix, Tesla early on are still kicking themselves.  Those who invested everything into e.g. Netflix was probably really scared when netflix dropped from $80/share to $15/share.  Those who invested a little bit are the ones who are very comfortable today.  
TL;DR: invest in bitcoin, but don't go balls deep unless you're 21 and are okay with potentially losing half or more of their money in 15 years

Mastercard's typically cater to the lower credit limit crowds.  Most cards which require below a 700 FICO score are mastercard.  You really think serious bitcoiners will make a dent when this demographic also includes single parent families, lower middle class, people rebuilding their credit, etc.

I am not disagreeing with your assessment of smart contracts.  
I do not believe you are considering the fact that those funds held in escrow provides a mutually identifiable transaction (token) in a trustless environment. Or in otherwords, the blockchain of DRM.  During which time you have a temporary "pay out" in the form of a token which allows access to temporary use of digital goods.  The temporary pay out can last for a set amount of time (producer does not receive goods until timelock passes) or indefinitely (token never expires in digital content or provides a decryption key).
That is entirely a smart contract.  If you cripple smart contracts to prevent DRM you, by definition, cripple smart contracts.  This is also a reason why Bitcoin is heralded as an excellent financial platform.  The smart contract language is so dumb, one cannot do meaningful DRM and such helps avoid "noise" on the blockchain.  Altcoins such as XPM or NMC shine as a DRM/featureful smart contract platform.  


DRM is entirely adjustable but the content owner has a lot of leverage.  Restrictive DRM, though fast, easy, and convenient for everyone from post-grad college startups to established corporations takes power away from the end-user.  Which is what, I believe, the satoshi philosophy is built upon.  Not saying DRM, EVIL, DOWN WITH DRM.  I'm saying lets keep the smart contract language dumb and keep DRM out of the platform, like what (OP) is advocating.
Sidechain to NMC or start a lightening network called DRMcoin if you must, but keep the cruft out of Bitcoin 2.0

these questions are pretty trivial (how do you walk a btree? -- at the max this is 3rd year computer science knowledge at a basic 4 year uni).  which makes it seem like they are trying to hire more talent at very low cost.  i would not be surprised if they made an offer of $45-$50k for a remote development position.  they will likely also offer to pay you in bitcoin which means your $50k could be as much as $150k if bitcoin reaches the next leg or as worthless as $30k if it drops.  me no bueno.
for comparison, my last remote dev position paid $130k.  my current (remote) position is paying $160k.  both of these jobs are/were in the financial field.
tl;dr: coinbase is likely not trying to find top talent unless you can write some really efficient code and even then you may be a lead of strictly jr devs making only $85k/year (which i guess is a lot if you live in the middle of nowhere with decent fiber)

great you didn't create inflation.  but i did because paying for a $50k car at 2% interest when my $500k investments are making 8-13% means a better outcome for me.
i guess i don't know what easy access to loans you mean but ~~everyone~~ a freaking high majority in this country needs a car to get around and so car loans are good business.  maybe if you stopped fighting this stupid argument about loans and started fighting for a way to reduce dependance on these loans these easy access consumer loans wouldn't exist.  but we can't make that happen because no one wants to put the effort in to do that.  instead we find a way to give more consumer loans by asking for and getting cash for clunkers *which destroyed perfectly working vehicles so people would take out more car loans*.  that's you, the people, doing that.  not the feds printing money.  but we are not the most educated country, so it's not surprising when things like this happen.

Of course you don't think, you have no idea about economics.  You are going by gut feeling of what you think nature should do when trillions of dollars moves hands every day.  You need to actually study the "idea behind fiat currency".  There's a lot more than just youtube videos and websites.  Go read up in the national archives just exactly what was going on in 1907, 1913, 1924, and 1931.  Then, when you're done with your history lesson, I recommend enrolling in econ classes at your local community college.

Easily hits the multi million dollar range.  As a way of saying thank you for admitting your crime we will punish you not so harshly.
You may not like it until you realize it's the exact same thing that happens when you get pulled over for speeding.  You plead guilty, the judge knocks off the points and you just pay the fine.  Even if you were doing 90 above, recklessly driving, etc.  You have money and show true remorse? Guess what, you get a lower penalty.  You mouth off to the judge, don't show up, or don't have money?

Lol Billions will be saved?  When it comes time to move funds with oil, you are not moving a few hundred thousand.  You are moving a few million, more like a few hundred million.  Sometimes it's not an actual check/wire transfer but rather the escrow of an asset.
AAL wants to cash in on the cheap oil, so they immediately turn over the deed of several $15+ million dollar buildings they own directly to the oil downstream companies.  the oil downstream companies in return gives them a contract of X million of barrels of oil on specific delivery dates etc.  this contract can then be turned around and sold later for other assets.
in this example there was zero cost for wire transfer, only the cost of drafting the contract so it is amicable to both parties, and the actual deeds and physical oil.  gauranteed by a signature, a handshake, and the enforcement of the us government judicial system.  PetroBitcoin is hard pressed to find a use case in that scenario when the cost of lawyers, flying personal to and from meetings multiple times, etc is still a fraction of 1% of the total revenue made on the deal... even if you factor wire transfer fees into the mix.

i'm 100% serious.  the 2006 banking failure was due to the removal of the glass-stegall act.  between then and 1936 we did not have banks cozing up with investment firms to package subprime lending into investment vehicles.
look, i'm not saying banks are not operating a pyramid scheme and staying ahead of the government.  i fully agree they are trying to do some underhanded shit just to increase their wealth.  what i am saying is that *they are not backed by the government for the purpose of operating a pyramid scheme*.  i say this by reminding you of the panic of 1907 when the government **was not involved in the banking system** and the very same "inverted pyramid scheme" collapsed.  the government, not backing anything, watching banks suffer and collapse. JP Morgan then stepped in to fix the problem.  In doing so, JP Morgan basically took on a monopoly of the banks and began doing negative things (such as using his extreme weight to drop prices on the stock market).  In 1913 the federal reserve came into action because failing banks *didn't want to be bought out by shiesters like Morgan*.
History is a hell of a joke, right?
@_date: 2015-12-13 19:31:28
you mean 50 years of inflationary pressure.  prior to the nixon shock usd was backed by a deflationary asset which limited the amount of control the federal reserve had to control inflation.  it just so happened we were the only country that wasn't broke or war-torn for a 60 year stretch so that limitation was not apparent until the rest of the world switched to fiat.
yes, your beloved fed which you love to bash was opposed to removing the gold standard until we were the last country backed by it and it was apparent that we were not going to get our way.

MZM isn't just checking deposits.  I don't think you knww what you are arguing about.


And what about the part that the bank must keep x% of a reserve?  Isn't this part of the federal reserve's inflation control policy?  E.g. the fed could always turn to congress and suggest increasing this reserve number to control inflation.  but because they have a host of other options, this is a moot point except for a last resort

JPM could prevent transactions they don't like from going through [for under $1b](  This will disallow blocks with a majority of transactions going to address A, thus allowing votes to address B to accumulate.  Or you could just disallow all votes to both address A and B once address B has reached an amount greater than address A.

But you see, unlike bitcoin, I cannot create multiple "wallets" (or accounts in this case).  So the money just sits there and can easily fall out of sync with a manual ledger.. especially when interest comes into play.  With bitcoin, I can create a wallet and just move the funds there.  When the time comes I can send the private keys (or i could use nlocktime to withhold anyone including myself).  Regardless, I get the final say about how my bank account is spent.

How do we know those people did not read lockheed's patent and are now plagiarizing?
I think because it took almost 10 years for anyone else to consider this means that a very smart fellow at lockheed was paid for his idea so the company could publish the patent.  Lockheed in turn made money from his idea and offers to the patent creator protection of the patent.  Just because there is a large corporation which you may not agree with on the list of patent owners doesn't mean the idea is not an obvious one.
Lockheed has also been using a real-world application of this patent for at least 6 years.  How do we know any of those multiple people never worked with lockheed and are leaking intellectual property?  You do not, but you do know this one guy several years ago first came up with the idea and patented it, none of these other people in the thread did that.  Maybe it wasn't so obvious.
I will leave you with [this](  A rudimentary idea on how to structure your texture maps.  John Carmack came up with a structure for storing textures for Doom in 1993.  John Carmack may have came up with it independently and the solution may not have been obvious, but that doesn't mean we should completely abandon David Kirk's vision (note: david kirk has never used patent law for financial game and instead did so to ensure everyone else is aware of an elegant solution).

I'm on earth where bulk processing rates are much, much cheaper than pay-per-swipe.  This statement:


is still valid, but because you are processing your payments at once you get a transaction fee *on the entire batch transaction*.  It will be above 25 cents, but if your bulk fee is 1% then $500 only cost you $5 if you had 1 swipe or 100 swipes.  
Of course this depends on your merchant provider.  For instance, authorize.net allows this but a smaller merchant provider will not (see circle, payanywhere, etc)

This is being downvoted for no reason.  It is true, there is a conversation the OP is not having in order to spread FUD about credit cards.  The merchant has a duty to reduce fraudulent charges, this includes verifying identity (signature, id card, etc).  **If a merchant follows their payment agreement, a merchant is not liable for fraudulent chargebacks**.
I run a brick and morter store, I train my customers on opsec well and we have never had a chargeback.  I also run an ecommerce arm of our storefront and we employ security checks which has resulted in 2 (valid) chargebacks over the entire course of our ecommerce site which has been running for 5 years now.  
Just as say about MtGox, don't let a few bad apples spoil the bunch, don't let a few bad merchant actors make you believe credit card chargebacks are rampant.  OP did something wrong and is not admitting to it for upvotes.
EDIT: how many stores have you been to where a young person swipes your card without even so much as looking at the card?  you can commit chargebacks against those merchants without fear of repercussion.  you may not do that because you have morals, but a lot of other people do.  when you are hassled to see your id?  that is a merchant doing it properly.  the difference is the merchants that don't care can usually afford to write off the loss, meaning *it doesn't truely matter to them*

right, but your webserver needs to talk to tor via a socks proxy. if your webserver spawns a process which uses system calls to determine it's hostname/ipaddr it could very well return the ip adress to the webserver which relays it over tor.  think man, these are computers we're talking about.  they can branch in almost infinite ways, what do you think a computer bug is?

If you are talking about TCP/IP, then you can create your own protocol (base it on TCP, i don't care) which can have an accounting field which could pass eg a bitcoin address (why you would do this i don't quite understand yet).  If you are talking about the TCP protocol which runs atop TCP/IP, then you are talking about the [3 bits]( of reserved, but not for accounting, space.  Again, I don't know what you would do with that.. set a flag?  Don't expect to send this across an untrusted network since other (bad?) TCP implementations may drop or destroy data in that field.

yes.  a bank can use bitcoind locally and tweak the settings so they are not using 100% cpu all the god damn time (and get away with 1 transaction as they guarantee their whole network).  it would take some premining but they could essentially ramp up their internal bitcoin addresses to match 1 satoshi = 1 USD.  now they can use this internal bitcoin system to facilitate "instant transfer of money".  the exact god damn way bitcoin is supposed to wipe banks out of existence.
the problem with your second statement is the bank can now offer the same features that bitcoin does meaning the masses will not need to learn an whole new technology when what they have is working perfectly fine for 90+% of americans.  further more, joe schmoe doesn't need to memorize a bitcoin address and give up his fraud protection.  i don't think you truely understand the use of credit in the states and how much people rely on fraud protection for the recovery of their money.

The fed maintains a server which allows scheduled transfers.  Both the bank and the fed have teams dedicated to operations and management.  If this were bitcoind, you wpuld have ops teams to manage servers, developers to fix bugs in the bitcoin software etc

If you are trying to kill off USD and move to a cashless society wouldn't you need to criminialize the use of cash?  What easier way to limit cash by making it a crime to deal with amounts of a certain limit.  As inflation kicks in, that limit gets smaller - shrinking the pool of cash users to flesh out the criminals.  This is where bitcoin is going to be great.  Once no one uses cash, the only criminals to catch are the one using antiquated fiat.  I mean lets look at it today, bitcoin enables the purchase of passports, drugs, and weapons, wouldn't it be the next logical progression, for let's say street thugs, when a gallon of gas costs $100/gal?  The working class will continue to purchase things via their CurrentC, Apple Pay, and credit cards. What will the real users of bitcoin do?  The answer?Adapt.  Bitcoin will be worth $10,000 a coin to continue enable the black market to thrive.

We sat with them going *back and forth* for 9 months before we gave up and demanded our money back.  They refused, we simply smiled, said thank you, and walked to our lawyers office.  The lawyer wrote a nice demand for our funds,the next day we received 50% back and an offer to resolve the issue with free professional services  .  At this point damage was done and we only demanded the other 50% back as we had a competing solution already in place and performing correctly.  
During this time there were no, insults, mentions of parties, or reasoning of lost income.  We knew the risk and accepted it when we bought the product.  Turned out our risk came back to bite us, no need to sue for damages -- however if they had not returned our money we would have sued and damages would have been factored in and BMC would have been in for a world of hurt.
So bottom line, there are errors on both sides of this story.  Robocoin is not in the clear, but *Metalab should have been aware of the risks and should have not put the full amount up front*.  That is just not how business with large sums of money works.  As far as I am concerned, all of these problems are surrounding metalab's infancy of a company and lack of leadership experience.  Had you had real executives working the project, there would be no public backlashing (does not look good in front of a judge), there would not have been a lease until a working unit was in hand, there would not have been any "surprises" about customs.  This is what you plan for when you deal with physical goods being delivered from a foreign country.  Further, you **never pay up front without someting tangible at that high of a cost**.  Maybe 30-40% deposit, additional 20% on delivery, additional 20% on setup, remaining balance 30 days after initial setup.

Well, we start by comparing bitcoin to the internet.  
* RIP was a major component of the internet, which works well, but was abused.  It's successor, BGP, was designed around centralization.  
* In a similar manner, Gnutella was a decentralized protocol which served as a real world example of how attackers could undermine a decentralized network (very similar to the structure of the bitcoin mining network, just with a much lower cost of entry).  
* Bittorrent, like BGP, fixes this with centralization and a decentralized component *for performance*.  
* Lastly, SMTP is a prime example of a usecase for which centralization is a key requirement and how decentralized email is just not a reality.
* Tor is another prime example, you have supernodes to manage the directory listings which are centralized points but the routing is decentralized for performance (compare to freenet which has 1/200th performance of tor but is completely decentralized)

Because we didn't (gold standard) and the great depression occurred.  And the government was helpless until the war began (read up on our presidents and congress at that time.  they are all eating living like kings in washington while 50%+ of the nation is starving).
Then we did and we avoided a financial meltdown in 2008 (we are still paying the price, but i think we can agree that the price to pay in the form of stagflation and horizontal growth is cheaper than all out financial armageddon). Even mini hiccups like S&amp;L scandal and oil embargos were mitigated by federal reserve interaction.  Prior to that it was left to capitalism to serve as the economic gas pedal.  Which is fine in times of booming growth, but when the oscillation reverses, corporations are the last place to look for assistance..


Exactly bitcoin is the extra layer ontop of USD.  Bitcoin is just another payment processor, not unlike bank accounts or credit cards.

Mine gets 99% spam, but when I need to work with a client that may or may not have a scanner I know they have a kinkos nearby or some other method of accessing a fax machine.  Now I have their signature, now they can get their product without sending me a check.
If they do have a scanner we use a dropbox style service for signed documents.
If they use bitcoin, we receive a specific amount of bitcoin which is recorded on the blockchain.  They tell us the amount in email so we have proof in court should the need arise.
We still have a fax machine and still check our mailbox everyday.  If anything email enhanced our lives just as bitcoin does, but it will not replace regular post or fax machines yet.

A company does not do better than inflation because their assets are still in USD which is subject to the same inflation!  
A commodity which is finite does not inflate, by definition because we humans, the users, are inflating which creates deflationary pressure.  Look at dogecoin, which by definition does inflate, and you can see the inflationary pressure.  Converting all your dogecoin to a company that operates 100% in dogecoin doesn't decrease dogecoin's inflationary characteristics.

Depends what you mean by mainstream.  Computers in general were not mainstream in the mid-90s.  One could not walk out of their house and pull a miniture computer out of their pocket (i'm talking general purpose computers not your silly ti-82 graphing calculator), but networks and the internet were mainstream for computers during that time hence the 4 leading online services integrating the internet into their services.
We are comparing apples to oranges.
Bitcoin is a protocol so it is no different than HTTP, GOPHER, or bittorrent.  The technology for bittorrent has been around and in use since the mid-90ds as well, are you saying it's now mainstream because the killer app for bittorrent is facilitating movie piracy?  If so, bitcoin already hit mainstream in it's ability to facilitate illicit drug purchases.  Bittorrent being used in eg openstack, blizzard installers are all recent, and arguably, breakthrough developments but did not make bittorrent any more mainstream than the piratebay/demonoid did.

Well those are the 5 largest examples I could think of.  Bittorrent and tor usage eclipses Bitcoin.  Gnutella probably had almost 5x as many nodes as bitcoin had in it's hey day.  Similar with RIP/BGP.  SMTP was just an example how some things are reliant upon central authorities.  Within the scope of bitcoin and banking, the central authority (read: government) needs the ability to control it's nations currency -- it has been proven several times in the last 100 years at least in the US.  If there is a separate USD currency that is inflatable independent of bitcoin -- what is the purpose of the extra layer?  why not just leave it at the usd currency?  *because you, the person, lacks control*.  So do we leave the ability to fix national disasters to public control or private control?

What I don't get about bitcoin is that eveyrone is saying bitcoin will replace banks.. but bitcoin cannot provide loans, bitcoin cannot manage your debt, bitcoin does not insure your funds.  Yet bitcoin will replace banks.  Well gee, let's compare this to another application: Openstack.  Openstack can do eveyrthing VMWare can do, so VMWare should be shaking in it's boots.  Except VMWare joined the Openstack foundation and now VMWare still has a complete product line which is superior to Openstack, even though they are contributing back to Openstack.  Openstack enables the cloud for millions of small developres and admins alike, but walk into a real (read: enterprise) IT shop and you still see VMWare and Cisco and HP running the show.  Moral: don't expect bitcoin to take over and replace banks, expect banks to pick the benefits out of bitcoin and use it within their products.. that is what open-source enables companies to do

you have to sign the same forms with bitcoin! you don't just magically erase the bitcoins from existence, they were once in your possession, now they are not.  you have to sign some forms and eventually get charged taxes and thus you have ultimately transfered a limited amount of money.
same concept, same outcome.
how about you get to writing to help change both policies.  I don't like to declare my funds anymore than you like filing schedule c's and figuring out your tax basis every quarter.  but mindlessly cheer leading bitcoin while ignoring its pitfalls is foolish at the very least
edit: also, you can still wire your funds, you just have to declare your funds to the bank rep, they can type it in for you because its electronic.  if you have a good enough banking relationship, you can self start a wire without any bank reps involved.  but no, that's not possible because you don't think it is.

So basically instead of JPMorgan, now you can go to OpenBazaar and other 3rd parties.  So really, banks are not in danger of going anywhere because they could adopt all the functionality of these same 3rd parties you mention.  Much like how some investment companies are now run by banks.  
I don't think I am being a troll, I think you, sir, are the troll if you think a bank will refuse to innovate and die when it is the banks that led a number of the innovating financial tools.  Just because bitcoin isn't one of them doesn't mean they can't adapt to support similar functionality.  For an example simply look to banks vs western union or banks vs paypal, the fact that you could email or phone call some money should have ended the banks reign right?  Now banks offer person-to-person payments similar to paypal (now that x.com's patents have expired).
I think the future is different from what we imagine, a hybrid of banks and bitcoins is what to expect, not the replacement or eradication of either.

lastly, bank to bank communication occurs in 10 minutes, its outdated regulations which prevent banks from wanting to innovate.  want them to process faster like in the UK?  write your politician and ask for stricter ACH transfer times (do not ask to remove this regulation else banks will just go slower)

Because we "printed" those dollars when we initially created bad loans.  In other words, we removed regulations to protect us from the very thing that happened.  Instead of setting precedent and putting the blame on congress, congress authorized the current printing of those dollars at the 2008 value of usd (which is cheaper than the 2004 value of usd).  QE funneled that actual printed money directly to the funds and bonds who were holding garbage debts.  In doing so, we neutralized the toxic debts that are floating around the world, but due to how loans work, we have not finished weathering the storm that we created in 2004 with lax regulations.  
In laymans terms the printed money from 2004 no longer exists but the money that was created from that printed money still does and is causing the turmoil you see today.
Let me put it this way, had we not bailed out the banks we would have truely "printed" trillions of dollars that would have failed with the bad banks.  What do you think would happen if trillions of dollars disappeared over night?

What is the point, the same argument can be made about cash in small claims courts as well.

So what you are *attempting* to say is that no matter what you use to fund your purchase the courts can get your money back.  **Which I never disagreed with**.  I am saying *compared to other refundable methods of payment*, eg credit cards, *checks are just as difficult as cash as recouping lost money*.

Gone are the days when you could call customer service and ask them if there is an outage and they FIX the problem as you're on the phone.  Nope, not anymore today.  They outsource fixing the problem to some guy who failed out of high school but had a very strong understanding of mechanics.

That cannot be done away with, remember it only takes $1m to topple bitcoin's decentralized trust architecture.  That is peanuts to most governments.  Just as with railroads and cars, the car crushed railroads because rail travel was too limiting.  Then plane travel, with the advent of the DC-3, decimated rail travel.  How do we know that bitcoin is not railways?  A strong currency backed by a strong network is what has kept the us dollar alive, bitcoin when faced with massive downward pressure will be unloaded similar to the gold flight of recent times.
It is highly safe and I fully agree that payment processors are shaking in their boots, but since an inflationary currency has proved to be a core fundamental platform for governments.. bitcoin by definition cannot replace a central bank.  I 100% agree that those "tiny" banks in the middle of nowhere US will see an upheaval in their business, the larger bank of america and chase banks will not be phased by bitcoin.  You underestimate the need for fast liquidity, which large organizations depend on, that bitcoin cannot provide without creating volatility within it's network.  
Your arguments are basically advocating for a two-tiered monetary system where the poor can use a decentralized bitcoin which is subject to attacks similar to the internet and a more efficient network used internally by centralized banks not unsimiliar to internet2 used by universities, governments, and wealthy corporations..  I fear we need to plan for a future where a hybrid of banks and bitcoin/cryptocurrency technology is used.  Remember, we were also supposed to have flying cars by 2000, we just now achieved direct injection and hybrid-electric.

you are trying to say currentc cannot replace bitcoin purely because of it's design. i am telling you that you are wrong.
i have also said napster's design was superior to itunes -- if the song doesn't exist in an official library, you can head to another users library and access the song.  way better than itunes who, if they didn't have it, left you SOL.  napster went public first, too.  suddenly itunes is out with an ipod with DRM and there went napster.
i don't know how i am trolling when i am pointing out competing technology which loses due to an external force.  i could use betamax vs vhs, a new technology beat an existing technology based on user preference.  you don't think the same can happen today?  if you say no it cannot, then carefully ask who is the troll

hi, infrastructure architect for a major bank here.
wire transfers complete within 15min for most banks, it requires coordination with central banks.  to most countries that's two hops but some are three or four.
ACH transfers complete in 10 hours for some banks, up to 48 hours for others.  the 48 hours are due to incompetent banks.  seriously their it goons are so bad we have to spend all day to ensure they submit properly (let me put this in perspective, it is cheaper to pay 15 people $175/hr to manage daily ACH transfers than it is to fix the problem. ) sometimes it takes more time, but then the bank is getting fined so they work really hard to hit that 48 hour window.
with that said banks like PNC, TD ameritrade, chase, etc can settle ACH transactions in 2 hours.  Td ameritrade, settles internal ACH transfers (account to account or Td bank to Td ameritrade) in 10 minutes.  they also have a serious infrastructure, by making their ACH process in parallel rather than in sequence, they can clear transfers almost instantly. capital one and chase are similar.  your local credit union?  they probably have 20 servers total and push through 5000-10000 transactions daily on old hardware.  their batch job starts at 12:01 and doesn't complete until 6am, or sometimes as late as 10am (this is also why your local credit union can notify you of incoming checks, because their volume is much smaller)
so yes, CPU is a huge bottleneck becausd it costs money to redesign and purchase and deploy and maintain new hardware.  also software, credit unions and small banks must outsource to 3rd parties who gouge you on development and support costs, so its not as simple as throwing up the latest win2012 image and loading your cics emulator..especially if you are still interfacing with mainframes.
look at it like the digital TV conversion, there are still people out there who dont know analog TV is gone.  or like the hybrid movement, we can offer 40mpg on all cars, we just can't all afford it yet.  and adopting bitcoin wont solve the problem instantly until it becomes a mature technology (or compare it to Linux, no one used that for critical servers in 2000 but they were in 2010 after enough money was pumped into it...)

Yes, but the thing is credit cards have been around since before the 1980s.  Just because responsible money usage is not taught in schools doesn't mean it should be ignored.  You have a credit card.  Your credit car pays for all of your monthly shenanigans.  At the end of the month, you pay that credit card (or for the less disciplined, as soon as the charge appears on your credit card, you make a payment immediately).  If you find unworldly charges that you didn't authorize you dispute and chargeback.  
Otherwise you are not losing any money since it is debt (and unrealized debt to boot).  The pull-payment worry you talk about is mitigated by the buffer of the credit card.  As you work to resolve the issue, your actual positive net worth does not change (your money is still in the bank).
To close, I just had an issue where my card has been devastated by fraudulent uses.  I mean outright massacred to the point where even **I** wonder about the future of plastic credit cards which we have today (i believe amex tokens will be the next direction).  My bank accounts still have $4k in them, so it's not the end of the world for me.  In fact there are innovations happening within the banking industry that allows you to activate and deactivate your visa card, so these issues we are talking about is moot.  I will let you know when it that is available on a credit card.  Until then, consider [simple bank](

Right, i think i understand that bitcoin acts as a transfer of value as directed by the blockchain.. but it doesn't explain how loans can be facilitated by bitcoins.  I am probably understanding this incorrectly.
Bitcoin itself has a facility to provide you with bitcoins as long as two constenting parties agree to it.  E.g. if you agree to loan me 1BTC, bitcoin would generate and provide me this coin, i pay you back which you in turn return to bitcoin minus the agreed fee.  That makes much more sense now.

I did because you are providing a service and using bitcoin doesn't magically shield you from laws (see mtgox, charlie sherm, etc).  
I see you have issues remember what we were recently talking about.   We were talking specifically about a USD tipbot using credit cards.


If I wanted to incorporate BTC tipping, it would be trivial to program it in -- but the btc tipbot does that already.  Right?  So why would I include BTC in a USD tipbot.. you can't tip USD in a btc tipbot so please help me understand why I am limiting myself when the comment was that i could make a usd tipbot and you blasting me saying it's not possible.  So what is it, not possible or am i limiting myself.  I mean am I so dense as to misunderstand that a usd tipbot should be limited to usd based tipping since it is a... *usd tipbot*.  I mean I just can't comprehend the lack of logic used in your most recent post which is starting to form an alarming trend.


You just described a money transmitter, like paypal or Western Union.  This does not replace the function of a bank.  I cannot get a bitcoin loan.  I cannot trade bitcoin for securities.  I cannot leverage debt with bitcoin.  You have told me interesting uses for bitcoin as a transmitter but nothing that would put bitcoin on par with banks to enable a government to support it's society.  Bitcoin companies will never loan you bitcoin because of the deflationary design of bitcoin.  Bitcoin companies cannot leverage debt, because there is no debt within the bitcoin system (or your bitcoin banking system which you are claiming).  A government cannot give their citizens bitcoin when they are broke or disabled, so when a country goes broke, it is at the mercy of whoever else has bitcoin to buy out that nation.  I cannot give BTC to apple in exchange for a share.  Bitcoin is not a very useful financial tool to replace banks with.  I will stop stressing this point because I don't think you fully grasp it.
I'm not even going to touch your comments on mesh networking because you have no idea how chargebacks and ERP systems work.  You have no idea about how network devices and computing devices are interconnected.  It's not just the network between the office.  It's the network in the office, those routers aren't free they cost money to power up and keep cool.  In fact that entire comment sounds like you have no idea how money is structured and used in the real world.  
Keep up the fight of bitcoin taking over the world.  I will be waiting here with your welfare check when you come back to reality.

No you didn't.  You got a chip that is designed to crunch numbers at a specified speed.  You do not need to use it for bitcoin mining on the public blockchain.  You can use it on testnet, on your own blockchain etc. With that said, how can you rationalize 8 months of damages when it can be shown that you can mine MORE bitcoins on a lesser-utilized bitcoin network?
Please think like how a judge is supposed to think, look at everything rationally not OMG I DIDN'T GET MY MINER IN TIME AND CANNOT MINE BITCOINS.

@_date: 2014-11-06 03:57:46
Scenario 1.  
I can control who gets my card, I can also control who gets to use my card for recurring payments.  It is way more convenient to have to deal with a mysterious charge once rather than going to every provider, ensure the target address is currently valid and then send my payment *every month*.  Strictly from a consumer experience, of course.  Hacker me wouldn't have that problem.  So I guess bitcoin is meant for hackers who can't manage their money and forget about fine print in contracts which they signed saying they read and adhere to all of the fine print and not to be surprised when a $30 payment shows up on your credit card on file that was described in your fine print.
But if you would rather have bitcoin so you could skip out on a payment you are obligated to make because you don't like a company's yelp review... by all means please don't let me stop you!

you must talk in absolute values during the time period.  beyond 2 months you had no idea what the value of btc would do, so you cannot claim damages on that.  only on what you paid (converted to the government's local currency) vs what you expected upon receipt of the hardware (converted to the government's local currency).

really hate to burst your bubble, but telecommunications are all voip (packet switched) until the last mile where sometimes its converted to copper [at the CO]( sometimes [in a green box in your neighborhood]( sometimes [in a gray box on the side of your house]( sometimes [directly on your network device]( and lastly sometimes [it's the earpiece of your listening device](
Fun food fact: All LTE phone calls are VoIP calls since LTE does not have a native "voice" packet.  Instead a modified protocol is used over IP with heavy QoS to ensure stability.  Plus "land lines" are simply non SMS enabled phone numbers.  The numbers are maintained by [NECA](  
When you order a "business line" you are doing nothing more than assigning yourself a phone number and registering the endpoint in a giant dictionary that anyone can dial and reach you.  Yes you read that correctly.  Modern telephone systems are no different than Skype, iChat, or google hangouts.  However just like Bitcoin this is too difficult for some people; To setup a voip server and configure a network connection that never fails, and manage individual phones flys over the head of simple people...  So they turn to turnkey VoIP providers (kinda like credit unions) or they turn to do-it-all-for-you providers like Comcast or AT&amp;T (kinda like big banks) because it's easier. 
NB: did you know Comcast business and other "business voip" providers just provides an SLA on the internet line coming to your place of business?  then they put a fancy looking cable modem with a battery in it and connect it to a cordless phone.  All VoIP, but they sell it as a "land line to your business".  The markup is ridiculous like 500% but people still use their service.  It boggles my mind too.
Bring this thread full circle, yes, this ad reads like bitcoin in 2014, but in 2034 we'll be looking back and laughing saying why did we think bitcoin would replace what's already in place.  It makes it easy for folks who don't need to memorize 51 character deposit addresses.

Wow, 1999 called they want gnutella back.  That's exactly what the nullsoft boys said when they came out with gnutella to counter napster. "Napster is centralized" they said, "being centralized kills efficiency and enables control, here is gnutella completely decentralized!".  And within a month transfer speeds dropped to 4k/sec due to the decentralized nature of gnutella.  Other protocols came and went, WinMX, Kazaa, Limewire, etc.  Finally bittorrent with DHT and magnet urls came about and guess what is currently the number one file transfer platform?  Not gnutella, not any of it's decendents but a completely new protocol not even designed a platform: torrent.  Now torrents today are a hybrid of supernodes (centralized) and a distributed network (decentralized). the decentralized aspect enables fast downloads, the centralized aspect allows for consolidation of resources - e.g. a file cannot be transfered if you cannot find a seeder, you cannot find a single seeder on a decentralized network.
moral of this post is that if we are using the internet as an example for bitcoin remember there was a long time where the internet was not efficient and it took multiple tries until the bugs were ironed out.  with that said, no one was jumping on cocacola.com or fb.com back then because *there was no utility value*.  those buying up all the bitcoins today hoping to affect a status quo shift may be burned in 10 years when the next cryptocurrency (CurrentC?) takes the lead

No, I could do this under the personal liability that is myself.  You think tipbot is a corporation shielding the owner from liability?  No.  In fact, the writer is only a subpoena away from house-ravaging damages if someone can prove to the court that tipbot caused losses and damages.  No different than a USD tipbot that I created overnight.  There is *nothing* limiting *you, as an invidividual* from opening a merchant or business account.  Instead of providing a tax ein, you provide your ssn.  You are, in the IRS' eyes, a sole proprietor.  You do not have shielding from liability that corporations provide (by registering a tax ein), you must still pay all taxes, report quarterly, etc.


With that said, yes I would paypal or dwolla or use some other cc merchant processing system for my tipbot.  3% of .30 is... $0.01.  Now let's do some math on Bitcoin, shall we?  .30 = 0.0006138 BTC.  In order for me to send that to someone else, I must pay for a transaction fee for confirmation priority.  Today the average is 0.0001 BTC.  *Let's maths.*
0.0006138 + 0.0001 = 0.0007135
Or $0.35.  I think I would even be more successful than the existing tipbots out there.


Further, I could accept paypal, visa, master/eurocard, and amex and accept payments globally.  Today.  Without having to pay yet another transaction fee and assess any tax liabilities on an asset which fluctuates drastically


I don't know if you do anything with computers in the real world, but out here we use SNMP which provides counters to every single thing your device is doing.  You want to route packets? We are counting the size, data, etc of each packet.  You want to get granular and count based on tenant? based on individual device?  individual packet type?  yea, that's already being done.  Then you have your (distributed) set of analytical servers which are processing these counters, referencing other live datasets such as price and calculating exactly how much each server costs per tenant, per device, per packet-type (you want to charge based on how many TCP FIN packets are sent, guess what, we can do that).  You can apply your charges in anyway you see fit.  Want to apply a 95th percentile to them?  Want to only charge RST packets destined to comcast?  Happens. Today.  Then this all ties into your prepaid system which can be anything.. your internal ERP system but, for your purposes, we can also plug in a CC processor, BTC processor etc.  You see the mesh network concept lies in the mesh network.  Extending it to use bitcoin is no different than extending it to use usd.  Which is done today, in every Fortune 500 company for all of their data chargebacks, etc.  bitcoin is not doing anything new here.

Why oh why do we keep saying a decentralized system will replace a centralized system when it is *proven* that it cannot.  Look at every decentralized system and you will find a centralized point of containment.  Bitcoin gives you no centralization around the blockchain. 
The other day I heard people talking about how manipulation is rife in the markets due to lack of regulation and there is nothing that can be done about it.  I mean that statement alone should put any serious investor and user of bitcoin at pause.  How can you replace a legacy system when the nextgen system is not ready yet (eg this new system of bitcoins does not enable government support)?  It's kind of like the new ATC dilemma...  How do you assist the poor and homeless when there are no bitcoins to give out?

No shit we have high taxes, because we keep buying shit we can't afford. But to say we pay more in taxes than food, clothing or shelter just means you are rich and you want to hodl more money so you can afford your gas while you indulge in libations on your vacation.  Some of us haven't had a chance to go on vacation because our shelter costs over 50% of our income (still more than our 28% tax tho).

I think you are missing the point, since you are just classifying it as an argument rather than a viewpoint.  So I'm sure the remainder of this post will be lost on you.


Because the rest of the world deals with an inflationary currency, bitcoin does not help for spending as it, by design, becomes more scarce as time moves forward.  This is great for holding value over longterm, but does nothing as a currency.  Making it great for banks to use internally, but which won't spur user adoption since it doesn't make it any easier for the average joe. 
This is a misnomer, you have to trust the entire bitcoin network.  That's like saying you need to trust the internet will be around tomorrow for your money to be valid.  Bank users know that they can insure their bank accounts.  Bitcoin users have no such protection.  Due to it's trustless nature, there is no support from insurance companies and actually makes it riskier.  Furthermore, as the bitcoin network grows it will just consume more and more power.  Let me repeat, power consumption will not go down as bitcoin resiliance goes up.  At some point the cost to maintain the bitcoin network will equal that of the banks.  Banks have an inherent advantage because they control the blockchain and can wait for 1 confirmation on a much much less system intensive algorithm.
I don't understand how a bank is not international, additionally, if bitcoin starts to take up adoption where it become cheaper to move large sums of money around it begs the question why banks wouldn't follow suit and adopt a similar method to increase the speed of bank transfers.  We already have wire transfers which execute in under an hour, I'm sure there are some smart mathematicians and process engineers on the bank's r&amp;d payroll to figure out how to speed that up -- by potentially using tada bitcoind!  Furthermore, last time I traveled to other countries I had no problem bringing my fiat linked credit cards with me to manage that pesky problem of conversion (and i didn't get charged fees for this service either!)
What innovations does bitcoin bring that the banking industry has not created over the past 20 years?  You cannot swap options with bitcoins, you cannot leverage debt with bitcoin.  It has created near instant value transfer, but paypal had that since x.com.  


Okay, that is good to remember when a country falls.. but banks already depend on each other for survival.  When mid-omaha bank failed, the fdic steps in and negotiates with other banks to maintain omaha bank's reputation.  That is the trust in this system.  Unlike bitcoin, if you have enough bad actors the entire system comes crumbling down (see ghash.io).  When Lehman's Brothers collapses, it's good to know that other companies wanted to liquidate their assets because it means it was worth something just not the over inflated value they were claiming prionaturer to their bust.  So it's actually good that corporations fail in this system.  MtGOX, and other bitcoin exchanges that disappear, fail with everyone's store of value.  Due to the nature of bitcoin, that value is gone forever rather than distributing the loss across the entire blockchain.
Effectively if bitcoin takes over, there is no way for the government of any nation to provide assistance to their citizens since they cannot control the flow of money.  This is fine in fuedal-system japan, but not modern day capitalism.
TLDR: all of your viewpoints support bitcoin replacing money transmitters such as paypal and western union but does nothing to address the services that banks offer to the community, market, and governments at the same time

instead you blatantly don't care about your tax liability.  I wouldn't transfer btc because you are essentially playing the markets and are taxed when you part with any btc.
just like how your tax man wants you to declare the use of &gt;$10k, your tax man wants to know when you're moving large quantities of bitcoin.  so each route has its pitfalls. when you are working in USD it is just easier to stay in USD than to jump hoops to convert it and pay taxes solely for the ease of transferring the money.

This 3% appears to be the magic number, but seriously I don't get why people here don't understand that you can negotiate that fee down to a low amount.  Payment processors still compete amongst each other and will gladly offer a 1% or more discount to your $millions/day transaction volume.  
If the argument is for small business, then they lose out on the trust provided by credit cards (chargeback, fraud protection etc).  Or in other words, majority consumers will not shop with them.  Don't go on with multisig escrow because the public is already weary when they have to use "special services" just to get a discount on something they normally wouldn't get (see 2006 housing debacle for a mainstream example)

pfft I could make a USD tipbot today. the fact is, you could have done the same with PayPal and its api before as well.. no one wanted to.
I don't truly grasp your concept of a micro transaction stream to enable a mesh network.  is that the block chain?  if so couldn't Visa's transaction system already be considered that?
as for multisig escrow, that's just pki.  keys trusting other keys, except you didn't have to worry about that unless you are moving large sums of money like in purchasing a home.  but I guess you can call PayPal and western union escrow services.  that is not something a bank needs to provide.

It's a 35 fee *in addition to* multiple days of court if the person you are suing shows up.  This does not end as soon as you file with the courts, as the defendant can bring counterclaims and a good lawyer.  In other words, assured mutual destruction is a perfectly valid defense and why you don't necessarily see these kind of bogus cases clogging the judicial system (oddly enough the ones that do are from plaintiffs/defendants with a lot of money).
So no, I'd imagine if you bought $2,000 of bitcoin by check from me and I actually sent you bitcoin, there's no way in hell you would file a $35 fee to get your money back because I would show up with a damn good lawyer and a countersuit for damages. And I imagine *I* would get that money without much effort.
If fraud was involved, then you have a chance to get your money back but OP never mentioned anything about fraud so this whole conversation is moot.  What I am saying is that checks are not refundable.  You cannot get your check back once it is cashed.  You can get other funds back to cover the cashed check but those funds have moved hands once the check has been cashed.  Or let me make this easier to understand since English is not your first language: if you gave me cash and I gave you bitcoin but you didn't think the terms were fulfilled you would have to go to court to get your cash back, **it is the same process with a check**.

Hi, lets look at this from a company risk perspective, as this is exactly how all companies determine if a move is a good move or not.
Apple Pay/Google Wallet - cedes all control to apple and google, companies who don't play with them have the risk of being delisted which affects the brand
Bitcoin - cedes all control to a bunch of random netizens.  nothing on the internet is subject to attacks so they are safe. wait, no that doesn't sound right. bitcoin would become an increased attack target and again the companies have no control which risks affecting the brand (when suzie's bitcoin wallet is not accepted properly EVERY.TIME. she goes to CVS UGH).
CurrentC - control remains within retailers control.  what is the downside (to the business?).  CurrentC could rely on bitcoin internally or externally but the fact is currentc provides a layer which minimizes risk from any other payment processor (that's what bitcon is right?)

Level II is the order book for a stock market (or bitcoin market if you want an analogy). When orders are placed, they are placed through many different market makers and other market participants. Level II will show you a ranked list of the best bid and ask prices from each of these participants, giving you detailed insight into the price action.

It was well known but we didn't have the last mile problem we have today - we were still battling the middle mile problems - which is why you say it was inaccessible outside academia and government. But there is evidence that people misconstrued what they thought the internet was.  For instance, we are talking about internet and you reference BBS'.  BBS != internet although for a lot of people who did use a BBS in the 90s thought they were connecting to the internet.
That said, delphi, compuserve and even prodigy were connected to the internet during the time you first logged into a BBS.  So the fact that that is was unknown is no more different than the 3d graphics advances that were happening at the time.  Just because it's unknown to few doesn't mean it is unknown to all...

because email does not gaurantee delivery, postal/delivery/fax services do.  this has been partially resolved by web applications (eg dropbox, irs e-file) but is far from an ideal solution for, say, filing a workers comp claim
EDIT: wow i'm being downvoted, no surprise here.  nothing in the [smtp rfc specifications talk about guaranteed delivery](  in fact, your mail server can be configured to wait a full day before sending emails.  if the remote server is unavailable, you have no insight until a day or several days later when your mail server responds to you to tell you the service is unavailable.  the other server may be misconfigured and may accept your message and never deliver it to it's recepient, but you have no idea to know that.  with eg USPS, UPS, Fedex, you can receive delivery confirmation.  with SMTP you send a voluntary read recipt which can be ignored by the receiver.  with fax, you are initiating a direct connection to the remote party, similar to walking up to your recipient and handing them the document.
EDIT2: I don't understand why no one is rationally thinking about this.

Oh you're one of those people.  Look, credit cards can be as low as 0.9% per swipe depending on the merchant.  I think it's safe to say Bitcoin's savings in merchant fees only present themselves at larger amounts.  There is still the issue of first acquiring bitcoin.  There is always some sort of fee involved, whether it is intrinsic (buying mining hardware) or outsourced (premium for localbitcoin, 3% from coinbase, etc).
Back to the original point, insurance does bring on an added cost, *which users are willing to accept* for convenience.  This is why i do not think bitcoin will catch on as a mainstream replacement...

You do realize magento is also multi-domain and offers SaaS as well?   Why do you dismiss this fact?
Then you mention Java 8 as if it's not based on it's roots from 1996 Java.  Upcoming PHP 7 is light years beyond php2 for example.  Why do you dismiss this fact?  You can't even explain what makes PHP legacy and why Java is not (even though it is from the exact same era).
Then there is the fact that companies wish to use hosted platforms which give them features.  What features does your "multi domain saas" approach give you that is differnt from Shopify? Different from Magento saas?  Why do you dismiss these questions?
Have you looked at magento ce's code base?  It also has unit testing, offers suggestions for integration testing (which we utilize using puppet enterprise), it also has analytics to provide realtime suggestions and reporting capabilities, alerts on those reports, exporting to truely legacy POS systems (think NCR systems), live help from agents which can "monitor" your user sessions.  We are using this *today*.  Your shit is not out yet, as you say.  So what exactly is your platform bringing to the mix that is better than what we already have today?  AGPL?  We don't benefit from AGPL, ergo we can continue to use Magento.

Java requires a runtime.  You can pull java apart and create your stack using weblogic, jboss, tomcat, or any other application server out there. You can run java using a local HSQL DB or Sqlite or any relational database backend.  You can use apache or nginx or checkpoint or any other http server to provide a proxy/firewall/loadbalancing solution.
I guess with PHP [you cannot run a php based webserver](  You [cannot use any other sql db besides mysql]( and [you are forced to use apache](  You [also cannot load balance PHP applications](  Oh woah is me.  What will I do if I didn't have Linux, Apache, or MySQL [(lol)](
Seriously this is your argument to get me off your case?  Do you even look at "the thousands of blogs" that discuss the joke that is Java?  Point is, you are doing a poor job at selling your java platform when valid php platforms exist.  You are getting flustered explaining it to me, a potential customer.

I seriously suggest having this discussion with a lawyer.  You are afforded special rights, of course.  But that doesn't mean that you can bend the license any way you want.  You know that time you posted to reddit, or stackexchange, or some java forum somewhere asking for help with a bug?  Yea, you may not be able to afford those special rights anymore.

ghash.io was double spending against satoshi dice for a period of 5-6 months.  it was pointed out on bitcointalk forums and ghash.io didn't admit to wrong doing but agreed to change their mining practices.  This was shortly before the 48% fiasco (you don't need 51% to double spend, you need 51% to ensure you always can double spend.  with 20-30% you can still double spend with a high probability of success...

this is serious because the fed require certain software to facilitate ACH and checking (connectdirect for all those who work in the banking field.. you know the pain I speak of).  we could very well incorporate bitcoind or other technology behind ACH but those small banks that service cities of &lt;10,000 people do not have money to upgrade their infrastructure.  
and this has nothing to do with fiat vs btc, but the cost of implementing software.  remember, bitcoin is cheap but very costly to integrate (unless you go with a third party which doesn't sit well with banks.. remember y2k?) same with connectdirect, autosys, bladelogic, and whatever expensive automation and orchestration tools they are using.

Mmkay.  You need to seriously take a step back, identify what you are trying to accomplish.. go over these licenses with a lawyer and then make a serious decision if this is worth the time.  Those three years invested will be great leverage for working for many many companies in the ecommerce field.  But based on your comments, if you pursue without doing the above then you will be on a railroad to disaster.
You have a slight misconception which creates a conflict in your statements.  How can you be against existing products primarily due to the GPL yet support AGPL which applies restrictions that further reduce business friendliness?  
How is your SaaS platform better than Salesforce or Shopify or any other platform that is out there?  How much will it cost to be competitive?  Say Shopify has a service for $9.99/month, how do you fit development, testing, research, operations, and continuity costs under your competition?

Actually, I'm calling you out.  How much do we want to bet that you just never paid that bounced check (or maybe you had an account closed with a negative balance).  Once you pay off the bad check, you are removed from paychex after up to 3 months.  If you chose to ignore it, it remains on the paychex system for up to 3 years IIRC.  
In my case, I found the bad check that had been missed when I went to open a new bank account in a new state. I immediately made good on the owed amount and was able to open an account 1 month later.

I understand you are trying to stick it to the man by becoming the man and competing against other men.. but [Ebay has a]( fully [open source]( independent commerce [solution](  Which is completely [customizable  to support bitcoin]( as well as a range of other additions.  It also has a CMS and API built-in and has the added benefit of being security tested against many many many large scale ecommerce deployments.
Then there's OpenCMS which is java based and LGPL which is business friendly.  Further all of my suggestions, even if GPL, are perfectly viable for business solutions since the usage will be in the form of SaaS which the GPL does not dictate source requirements until distribution.  The flipside is a business then extends your software and resells it putting them in direct competition with you.
I think you should pause and not ask what wants but what and or etc need.  Businesses do not want bitcoin integration, they want solutions that offer responsive interfaces, easy configuration, quality reporting etc.  If it has bitcoin, that is a bonus, but bitcoin is not the killer feature that will turn a business away from Shopify to a solution that they must manage themselves.  Let me ask you this.  What does your software provide over every other existing suggestion I have provided?

Haha.  Wordpress is free to relicense under the GPL.  But **your customer base doesn't want the AGPL** so they will fork at the last version that was GPL and rename it to SentenceFactory.  See MySQL v. MariaDB.
This means your target market, the users of Wordpress and other CMS and ecommerce solutions, do not want the AGPL.  You want the AGPL as a service provider, meaning you do not want any competition in your field.  This is why I said you are conflicting in your mission.  Which brings me to my next statement, what is the mission statement behind this entire project?  What is it hoping to solve?  What is your competition, how do you differ from them?  How can you create a cheaper product than what is out there already? etc. etc. etc.  
You cannot answer this because you say you have never talked to a lawyer.  Hello buddy, if you want to replace giants such as Wordpress, you will eventually need to provide a contract.  Wouldn't wordpress inc. have such a document already drafted?  
Lastly, AGPL does not protect the license owner when you, the entity, are using it for yourself. Eg. me taking your software and using it within my house for my own use.  No need to distribute.  Company XYZ taking your software and using it for the company's use (e.g. internal operations which never leaves the corporate intranet). No need to distribute.  You do not realize this, probably because you have not talked to a lawyer.  You should really talk to a lawyer about licensing contracts.


Which will not happen when your customer base *prefers* BSD, MIT, Apache, and GPL licenses.  As long as something exists which provides greater business value, you will never reach your goal.  Magento community edition = Less maintenance costs from distribution, less legal costs to ensure compliance, less server resources, less specialized contractors or employees, etc. etc. etc. than your intended solution.  
Just my satoshi again

Hell, I had a bank write me out of the blue to tell me an account that I opened with my parents had migrated through 4 or 5 bank mergers.  During each merger, interest accrued.  Of course this was back when we had a solid economy and prime rates of 4%.  Nevertheless, they searched me out to tell me my initial $250 deposit had grown to $1500.  I cashed that shit out and went to Atlantic City.  Would BTC-e do that? Nope they would confiscate it for themselves.
Not my money in their hands, but at least banks have a vested interest in not bilking over their deposit customers.. since I gave them the money so they can loan out and continue pumping the economy so I can collect my 4%.  Now that savings accounts only accrue 0.2%, I no longer keep my money in banks but invested in funds, stocks and bitcoin.  It's still not "my money", but I retain ownership and only do business with trusted individuals and businesses.

You do realize that Magento and OpenCMS both have "enterprise" versions which mirror the community version.  It sounds like you do not like the control which the GPL allows and you wish to restrict it further.  The problem is, again, your restriction will also restrict your customer base.  
I fully understand about multi-licensing, I am not new to the startup game.  I got my chops in 1999 and witnessed first hand how these same ideas ruined a company.  The thing is, after the dotcom bust, *startups have still not learned*.  I'm only pointing out that all of these products exist which do the same thing BUT also provide a less strict license for the community.  All you are trying to do is alienate the community to gain enterprise customers.. except there is no reason for enterprise customers to switch to you because you offer nothing different from other providers which do not limit the community version (remember those same companies who have dedicated staff to managing FOSS and their licenses inside their organization).
Let me be clear with my question now.  Have you discussed these licenses with a lawyer?  Do you truly understand the impact these licenses have on your business plan, or are you crafting your business plan around the license (sounds like what you are doing).  Because lawyers don't only talk about repercussions but help you understand what the license means both inside and outside of court.  Because if you have $4k in your bank account and a company starts using your program against the AGPL, what recourse do you have if they have $90k in their bank account dedicated to lawyers?  You can go toe to toe and you will be broke by the second trial.
Let me hit you with one more thought nugget.. if a company only uses your product inside their company, they have no reason to distribute their changes.  If they need to do something outside of their company they use Magento, OpenCMS, or even Sharepoint.  GPL/AGPL, you're still not seeing any sort of monetary gain nor community benefit.

It sounds like your problem is what why we need to keep raising taxes.  And the answer is because we keep demanding more shit from our government.

A majority of the country was for the iraq war.  Let's not fool ourselves, this was right after 9/11 and we were looking for blood.
I don't think you understand that the government is a physical manifestation of the 300+ million people who live here.  It really sucks when 150 million of them don't agree with what you think, you need to learn how to deal with it.  Trying to rile up with right-wing gargage does not help your cause.  Don't forget the republicans (who fund tax foundation) created the mess we are in today.  Also don't forget that the democrats keeps our debt going with public healthcare.  Lastly, millions is chump change when we are talking about TRILLIONS of debt.  Who the fuck cares if a website ran a few million over.. we are still occupying countries overseas which cost us MILLIONS PER DAY.  But yea lets look at a *website* for examples of incompetence.
Let me ask you a question, why aren't you running for some public office trying to affect change?  It's a little bit more comfortable to quarterback from your armchair isn't it?

Social security is not funded by our national debt.  It is self-funded by we, the people, in our SSI tax which we allow our government to borrow for other uses.  See, the post office as another example of a self-sufficient program that is ruined by greedy states
And if that's what it takes for us to pay back our debt, then there are a few other countries who are way more fucked than we are.  What is likely are international agreements that bail out the debts of one or many countries in this position of "no return" that you claim. TPP comes to mind...

They can!  have you setup or even looked at any of these other programs i have been mentioning?  Market research, man!  You should know what your competition is doing (but you should really talk to a lawyer because simply looking at [GPL source code could taint your AGPL code base]( lookup clean room decompilation techniques to understand what i am saying)


[why does reddit recommend legacy tech?](
[webhostingtalk, pretty reliable viewpoint of the hosting industry, also recommends legacy tech](
Also hasn't Java been around just as long as PHP?  Doesn't that make [java legacy tech]( too?  Why [aren't you]( making a [AGPL ruby]( on rails [ecommerce platform](
[looks like i am not along in suggesting legacy tech](  Do you even understand my viewpoint?  It is great that you are creating personal pet projects, that is awesome. I am not stopping you from doing that.  I am helping you prevent your delusion from turning into a costly mistake.  If you are approaching this as a personal project, **ignore everything i have said**, keep trucking down that route.  It will be a great opencart or woocommerce replacement for mom and pop shops.  If you are trying to make a business out of it to replace or even compete with eg sales force, shopify, or magento, then you really  need to sit back and come up with more than just a licensing scheme but also business plan, revenue and cost estimates, and contracts.  Best of luck, let me know how I can provide more guidance if you choose to monetize your platform (because remember it makes no sense to monetize your platform if your goal is to only break even or worse lose money!!!).

1) Whoa. have you not heard about credit cards with smart chips?  Just because your backwards country doesn't use it doesn't mean all CCs are bad.  Fraud protection helps in the event I  *lose* my private key.  It's nice to go to bed knowing I will get a notification if someone stole my card.. AND get that money back because a Merchant did not verify the cardholder's identity.  Not when I open my wallet and find $5000 missing with no recourse.
2) You can't offer that without size.  So yes merchants of Bitcoin can *one day* offer that service, but AMEX offers this **today**.  If you tell joe schmoe to wait 5 more years, do you think he's going to throw out that AMEX card now?
3) see 2
4) see 2

NASDAQ retains an orderbook with all the trades for the NASDAQ market.  TD ameritrade trades on NASDAQ.  Td Ameritrade can trade NASDAQ stocks internally without askign NASDAQ for other market makers.  When Td ameritrade, as a broker, moves your NASDAQ stock to my hands, it sends NASDAQ an order record to NASDAQ can hvae accurate orderbooks -- Td Ameritrade ALSO maintains its own orderbooks for tax, complaince regulations, whateverthefuck. 
 Now when TD Ameritrade needs a NASDAQ stock that it cannot fulfill (maybe you're asking for 100,000 shares and TDA only has 5,000), it goes to NASDAQ and says hey who else has this stock?  NASDAQ gives them all the MMs, ECNs, and wholesalers with stocks and the best prices.  Td ameritrade then says I want to buy xxx from this money maker.  Td ameritrade, via NASDAQ, asks for this.  this gets logged in NASDAQ's order book because a stock has changed hands (from say sharebuilder to capital one).    This whole system?  Is called Level II.
What are you still confused about? 
This is like taking a bitcoin from you and giving it to me even though you are on bitstamp and I use OKChina.  Bitcoinwisdom or any other third party BTC analytics service still aggregates both orderbooks to give you a wholistic view just like NASDAQs orderbook.  Stamp and OKC still have seperate orderbooks...

We are using them for our projects!  That's what I am trying to point out to you.  We have several users using shopify, magento, opencart, and someone just asked for zencart today.  These are not small establishments, these are large multiserver deployments that generate between $7-16million revenue every year.  Can your software reliably handle $100m+ in cummulative sales across tens or hundreds of stores?  Reporting and analytics?
How will your software add value beyond what we already have?  AGPL will reduce any value we would gain in switching simply because it will increase our costs.  You are hosted? Well great, but there is Sales Force, Shopify, Magento SaaS, etc.  What makes your homegrown solution better and how does it lower my costs?  Sales Force, shopify, etc all provide SLAs and 24x7 support teams.  Do you provide that for $5 per user per month?  Do you even know how much your hosted solution costs per user per month?
If you're not willing to work with me to make more money, then I will not work with your platform.  Are you understanding my "contridicting" points yet?

Because these companies have an interest in making this as difficult as possible to remove you.  However laws exist from pre-internet days for services that provide a credit reputation service which clearly states written communication is needed.  Since you do not have email addresses of contacts you have to settle with writing them to their legal address requesting information and/or removal.
Likely, the bank which you bounced the check for did not update chexsystems with your payments.  You could have threatened them with lawsuit but it sounds like you never reached out to chexsystems, officially (certified letter, dated with a deadline for response, etc).  
If you take a step back and look at the big picture, this is not unlike having to deal with an accident or health insurance claims.   There are regulations and laws surrounding the entire process, you can either go to someone who specializes in the process or learn and do it yourself.  
TL;DR: Even if you had bitcoin back then, you could very well be denied from private businesses if they still performed background checks on you.

Fdic doesn't reimburse you, the reimburse the bank who absorbed the new bank for their losses.  Say Omaha bank and trust closes with 8m assets and 12m in liabilities.  Chase takes over, in fluxes cash and keeps the banks moving (notice I used chase as an example as he personally began the process in the panic of 1907).  The bank eventually becomes a chase bank or restructured and sold.  All of the losses chase took on comes back to them from the central bank that Fdic oversees.
When Omaha bank and trust is illiquid and cannot open the doors until another bank can buy them, then the central bank picks a bank and facilitates the merger.  The new bank receives funds but has the option to fix the problems with the bank e.g. close accounts that are always negative, sell bad loans to other parties, etc.

So because of competition you are willing to screw over your users in order to trap them in your service?  Sorry that's an excuse from a business that deserves to fail.  You know where else I heard that?  2007, The banks.
Detach yourself from bitcoin for a second and look at how these businesses are acting.  Coinbase getting a user banned from subs because of their username.  ChangeTip keeping money from banned users while being vague on what constitutes banning.  Coinbase monitoring your external bitcoin transactions, etc.  These are all nefarious actions to ensure the business is successful.. but how is that different from banks that can charge you $40 overdraft fees when they also control ordering of charges that post to your account?

Wow your post is riddled with so many incorrect statements.


[That is precisely what the FDIC was created for.](


There was nothing illegal that happened [*since legal regulations were removed prior to the acts happening*](  It's kind of like realizing a lot more people turn into stoners after weed is legalized, but you can't go around arresting everyone who's a stoner saying they are criminals.  You need to recreate the law, eg the Dodd-Frank act.


Which is why you should pay attention when YOUR senator or congressman votes to repeal or create laws.  YOU the people vote, not YOU the armchair netizan complains online and things magically change.


I had exactly $5k in my bank account when the banks failed.  I put all my money into stocks and ETFs such as QQQ and made 314% without touching anything at all.  That inital $5k turned into $16k in 2 years.  Then the fed dropped the prime rate which enabled me to get a 30-year mortgage using the $16k at 3.1%.  I am not rich in any way shape or form (I make $38k/year lol), but I profited just the same as those rich individuals and organizations that "gambled their wealth". 
I had friends who were sitting around and commenting how everything is going to burst, start buying gold and shorting real estate.  These guys were potheads that didn't have much money but used what little money they had to better their lives.  
I had another friend who jumped in the bitcoin game at $500 per and walked away at $900-something.  You're going to tell me now that bitcoin is a system gamed to accelerate wealth inequality?  Technically those that got into bitcoin at $1/coin were laughing to the bank at you suckers buying at $300+
The fact is everyone can do that, if you're not willing to learn about economics and how markets work then you're doomed to poverty.  If you don't like that, you need to leave America because America *is a company*.

no, because the insurance companies that back FDIC (and your homeowners insurance, and your employer's insurance, etc) *ran out of money because they bought the very same bad bonds that the repealed law banned*.  would you have preferred another great depression?  because when economic velocity stops, everyone starts hoarding.  you should take some basic economic classes.  it is quite understood since the roman era that a government should have some sort of control on the monetary system.  to what extent we are still trying to figure out.  we have done nothing, and we have tried to do something.  both has it's pros and cons and we may very well find a new way to address future fuckups that appeases more people


Would you be okay with pot smokers in Washington or Colorado being hauled off as criminals?  They specifically voted and repealed the law which made it illegal.  The answer to that question is my answer to your question.


And when your senator says we need to implement controls on bitcoin.  Sure bitcoin can still operate in another country, but what good is the utility when major players are not using it?  Zimbabwe's dollar is extremely cheap and plentiful, but we're not making a technical solution using their currency.


Blah blah blah, I have a house.  If you think that's an inflated valuation, then I can tell you you are wrong because I enjoy my house and gladly find it to be appropriately valued compared to everything else I purchase and consume on a daily basis.


but somehow the banking system does?  how about the sheer low cost to completely attack the bitcoin infrastructure?  further, how about how a centralized party has proven they can attack bitcoin yet we just dismiss it as 'oh well no one can ever have 51% therefore it's moot'.

Nope.  I can take your GPL code and charge a "reasonable" amount for you to access the source.  What good is GPL code when you have to pay an arbitrary amount of money plus give up your personal information.  GPLv3 sorta fixes this, but still leaves a giant loophole for you to only distribute your software via external media and thus allow you to charge for it.  If it costs you $100k to build and host this software and you only have 1000 users, it's perfectly OK to charge $100/user to get the code (based on the language of the GPL, a court's interpretation could be different but that hasn't happened yet).
Then there's the whole "distribution" definition which hasn't been proven in court...

all of this could be well and valid and a dispute could still come your way (eg a stolen credit card and fraudulent id card), if you do not have proof that you did 1, 2 and 3, the cardholder's dispute is valid and the merchant loses the funds to visa (the merchant still has other avenues to recoup funds but it becomes harder and costlier).
i am not in any way saying you are wrong, i am saying there are still valid avenues for a bad actor to persevere.  having your employee captured on camera performing 1, 2 and 3 (or some other process of capturing your controls process) is enough for the merchant to be within bounds of their agreement.

and what exactly does your private key look like?  random data?  do you know what is running on the system to understand the structures so when you do piece it back together, you can extract the key?  in theory it sounds plausible, in reality you have monitors on the hypervisors ensuring rogue processes don't exist/cpu load is kept in check, etc.  
to put it succinctly, in my environment no one but a core team has access to hypervisors.  even then they do not have access to the virtual instances which is handled by a separate team.   on top of all of this, we audit all of our logs and running processes.  we monitor anomolies.  if you have all the time in the world, you can probably break in, but we aren't sony (we have a security team)

* we said the same thing about security with open source software.  then we have heartbleed, shellshock, venom, etc.  what is left out here is *how* open ledgers make audits "more easy".  because "more eyes" can look at them?  then why do we have the aforementioned vulnerabilities?  because more eyes doesn't translate to more *accountant's* eyes
* why are we dependent on TBTF-banks, today?  why do people bank with eg Chase, bank of america,etc instead of credit unions.  this is something that can start today but has not happened.  decentralization will force a change that society does not demand.  what happens to supply when demand is not met..

i wouldn't do that, let's keep the rfc spec the way it's supposed to be implemented.  for the task at hand and minimal complications (hence why gnutella was never turned into an rfc spec!).  we should create a payment protocol, which receives a list of requirements and returns a list of available services + costs + payment address.  upon choosing your service and sending payment, you receive a token, similar to oauth/radius/etc which you transmit via original protocols.  it is then up to the receiving app or helper app to translate it to something that the original app can use.  i think a protocol like this is beneficial and i have a use case that we could support today if you are serious about implementing this
source: i have written rfc's for several protocols (failed and implemented) and have experience in this field.  i like the idea of bitcoin over protocol, but let's make sure we're doing this properly rather than implementing a ham-handed approach that will just get reimplemented once it grows in size

Yes.  If you control access of the hardware, you can always retrieve running information.
However obfuscation is in play to slow down efforts. Many new hypervisors offer signed memory storage as well as the basic guards that randomize locations of memory allocation.  Further your application can obfuscate itself across multiple hosts.  Of course none of this stops the possibility of a driver intercepting input from your virtual console as you type in the passphrase to unlock your cryptfs volume.

Liability and capitalism are incompatible with each other.  To be honest and righteous means you can't maximize profits.  To maximize profits you have to be underhanded and undercut your competition to win.  It is the prisoners dilemma and you can only win by not playing.
To be honest the problem always existed but the citizens united case solidified the corporate veil.  Again the United states is a tort based society.  Some entity is always liable. Always.  Regulation is a compromise that straddles that line.  Sometimes it's too far (AML/KYC), other times its not enough (dodd-frank... lol).  But we are a young country, there will be some growing pains we must live with.  We need to remember that what we are doing will normalize to a common sense outcome in 1000 years.

You also haven't explained why NSA having access is bad especially when strong security principals dictate that you should use your own CA whenever you demand private communication.  So again, even if Verisign is "compromised", how does that break your communication... because you want to use google or shop on walmart?  How do you know China's NSA hasn't compromised your CA?
so to resolve this, instead of using PKI as it was designed to be used (with multiple CAs and a mix of encryption standards) you would rather start from scratch and build something extremely complex that removes protections that are in place today.  For instance, how will you validate that google owns google's certificate? Look up on the blockchain, ok. And what happens when google's private keys are stolen, google needs to update their blockchain?  How do you know the new certificate is really googles?  Because google posted it on their now unprotected website?  This is why you centralize trust in authentication.  You need trust in this application.
Remember OpenDNS has been around for over 10 years now, it did not replace the standard dns system.

There are different types of order books in, for example, there are three in the NASDAQ marketplace:
Market Makers (MM) - These are the players who provide liquidity in the marketplace. This means that they are required to buy when nobody else is buying and sell when nobody else is selling. They make the market.
Electronic Communication Networks (ECN) - Electronic communication networks are computerized order placement systems. It is important to note that anyone can trade through ECNs, even large institutional traders.
Wholesalers (Order flow firms) - Many online brokers sell their order flow to wholesalers; these order flow firms then execute orders on behalf of online brokers (usually retail traders).
Each market participant is recognized by the four-letter ID that appears on level II quotes.  Trades occur on the platform.  It is the market participant who places orders between other market participants for the reasons outlined above.

On our SAN, we can take snapshots of any volume attached to any virtual server.  We can replicate this volume anywhere, SAN, NFS, SMB, etc.  So if we receive a court subpoena, we simply snapshot and send them the data.  That is how law enforcement seizes servers, they do it for Silk road they do it for Enron. 
There are controls to avoid this, one would be to not use a third party hosting service.  But sometimes that is unreasonable, so you take the risk of your contents being imaged.  You combat this by encrypting your instance volume.  However you need to provide the keys in some manner.  So no matter what with a third party hosted cloud you are giving up control but you do that at the expense of a company that has much more to lose than you.  If AWS gave away random information for the lolz, then amazon's stock will not be worth the $300/share it is today.  Even if this happened once, a $50 drop in stock price is equivalent to removing a few $billion of dollars from the company **and economy**.

a protocol cannot replace the legal system.  lets just end that topic right there.
laws duplicate laws all the time.  it's illegal to kill people, but suddenly we have terrorism charges (see boston bomber).  it's illegal to commit violent crimes, but we also create laws that makes it illegaler to commit already violent crimes with more violent weapons (robbing someone with threat of harm is a violent crime, but it's more violent with a gun (which threatens harm)).  
this is how our country is designed, we stack laws on top of laws and then we pay lawyers and appoint judges to decipher and interpret the text and original meaning of the laws.  this begets case law which redefines existing laws.  then we have executive actions along side all of this.
regulation is nothing more than all three of these combined into one.  so of course, regulations are going to be captured by other laws or executive actions.
i really think you should take a semesters worth of civics and history.  a lot of what you are saying is from lack of knowledge.  try to take courses to become a lawyer you will understand the reason why this needs to happen.  i said a lot of the same things you said, then i worked for and sat the bar.  now i have a completely different view, especially after spending a few years in court rooms.  people are idiots and will do things without an ounce of personal culpability.  and that's just individuals.  those same individuals exist in a corporation.  but we cannot just do as you say, remove the limited liability factor of a corporation because (a) we defined that in the legislative branch and (b) enforced it with the juducial branch.  the only thing that could undo that action is a constitutional amendment.  BUT with the citizen's united supreme court ruling, we gave corporations a voice.. which means now corporate money can effectively veto undoing that action.

If the fed does not raise interest rates it's because other countries are not raising rates either.  The real reason to raise rates is to woo domestic and international investors to your currency. When we are in a global recession like we are now, every country will try to lower their rates in order to increase their exports (people/companies/governments will gladly spend another country's currency to get it off of their hands).

i run a brick and mortar chain.  we see less than 3% of our sales charged back.  this is enough that we only have to raise our in store prices on average about $0.03 to cover those charge backs.  on our website we see a lower chargeback rate of 1.27% (numbers calculated as of 1/3/15) or in other words about $0.0141 average price raise.  So by accepting consumer protection we only have to raise our prices $0.05.  we did $19m in sales in FY2014.

And how many CA's are also totally "compromised" by [GCHQ, FIS, BND, SISMI, RAW, NRS, or any other intelligence agency *that every soverign nation has*](
So either the CA allows their soverign state to access their CA (see AT&amp;T as an example), or the CA has been infiltrated by another soverign state.  In the former case, the CA is not compromised since it is well aware -- how is this different from the CIA having access to passport or drivers license data?  In the latter case, the CA has definitely been compromised but the soverign state has many policies at it's disposal, up to and including war, to resolve the issue.
Also remember, a compromised CA does not automatically mean all data will be compromised.

my pops worked in regulation.  he did not try to create more regulation, but he found so many problems with the way the business lost money that it was *necessary* to create internal regulations.  he then became a government regulator and found so many ways that corporate greed would trump common sense (dumping toxic waste into a public water source, for example) that the regulation was almost required.  
so how do you balance this?  you allow companies to do things but they will try to undercut processes to save a dollar or two.  regulation levies criminal penalties which pierces the corporate veil and allows for individual responsibility.  regulation ultimately helps prevent a sociopath from making decisions at a company.
so think twice about massively cutting regulation when you e.g. eat a chipotle norovirus burrito else you will have situations like the 2007 housing disaster (brought to you by removing regulations and assuming banks would act in the population's best interest)

Wake up, these new things like obamacare are not helping.  
Just to be clear: bitcoin won't fix the underlying problem just as moving off the gold standard didn't fix the underlying problem.

Yes yes you are correct.  But I am pointing out what started and thus enabled it all :)
The whiskey rebellion only comprised of the 13 original colonies.  As we expanded, such as to the wild west and french louisina states, we also expanded our federal government and army to ensure another whiskey rebellion style events did not even start.  So what came first in America's official history was the rebuff of an uprising by our army.  The start of the 19th centruy we had the making of civil war that was, again, stopped by the federal government's army.  
Then the run up to the civil war (mid 1800s) was ALL about finance and taxes that had been brewing for the past 50 years.  The north bought cotton from the south, then labor wages went up, the north defaulted and the south demanded payment.  The north, backed by teh feds, said no and strong armed them with the army.  So I'm fairly certain the army has been enforcing taxation and other monetary policies for the enterity of the nation's existince.  I would even say that the civil war solidified the collection of income taxes and enactment of monetary policy with threat of force
Look to other countries as examples as well.. Iran, Egypt, France, Russia, Taiwan, Koreas, etc.  Their federal army was monumental in forcing a bueraucratic regime
Also we need healthcare.

Your first statement isn't necessary for the second statement to be true.  You can release your source code with a very restrictive license to e.g prove prior art or show proof of concept (for future licenses/royalty payments).  Take a look at Microsoft, they offer source code of their major products to governments, schools and large institutions.
It's the closed source software which enables capitalism.  If you want to socialize software, you need a more permissive license but that opposite doesn't automatically mean software is closed and not trustworthy...

maybe i shouldn't call him out as the problem, but there is definitely bad leadership in bitcoin core.  as a software architect for 15 years running now, i would have defintely optimized their roadmap a little bit better.  but i also fully understand what it's like to work under an oppressive management regime, which i'm certain blockstream is

First of all China != USA, so please continue to defend their right to sell tainted food as much as you want!  Second of all, an individual does not need regulation (there are criminal laws already in place) however a Corporations do since it shields personal liability. 
We are a litigious nation.  However, at some point we need to assign criminal penalties rather than only civil.  Chipotle's CEO makes $xx millions per year but faces zero retribution if he tells his operations managers to source food from a landfill.  If that food kills someone, there is no "person" to go to jail.  You can't jail a corporation, you can only fine them.  You can fine all the money in the world but that won't stop them from killing people from tainted food.  Enter the regulation.  
In this example, regulation states you will not source food from a landfill.  As you can see, you should not need this regulation it's a no-brainer.  landfill food makes you sick.  But when the CEO says I can make an extra $2m a year by switching to landfill ketchup, you have problems.  You need to define what is sourcing food, what is a landfill.  This is all regulation is, a legal framework.  Now Chipotle's CEO can go to jail because he authorized the request to source food from said landfill.  On top of that, the person or persons affected by the CEO's judgement still has their right to claim civil damages not only from the soon-to-be bankrupt Chipotle, but also from the, now guilty, CEO.  Personal responsibility.
Again, in this example, I will not defend the CEO for making a decision to sell tainted food.
Food for thought: you know why no one went to jail for the 2007 housing crisis?  Because we removed all regulations that enacted criminal penalties for doing EXACTLY the nonsense the banks pulled with MBS, CDS, and CDOs.  When there are no criminal penalties, no one is held responsible.  Then all we have are banks paying token fines that they recoup in an day's worth of trading.

are you familiar with the prisoner's dilemma?  here is your disconnect.  no matter how righteous you are, someone will undercut you.  look at martin shrekeli and bernie madoff as examples.  there is no personal liability because of corporations, as per my original example.  i'm not saying anything new here.  regulation forces personal liability, you see?


that statement says they are.  you cannot have 100% liability with 100% profit, you cannot have 100% profit without 100% liability.  or, since we are in a technical sub, think of it this way.  in modern computing you can only have 2 of the 3, security, performance and ease of use.  notice how bitcoin has security and ease of use but lacks in performance.  as we push to increase performace we are going to lose ease of use.  visa on the other hand has performance and ease of use but whoefully inadequate security.  the push-pull you are speaking of is exactly what incompatibility is, you must trade off one for another.  simple logic and reasoning really
and as for your last statement


they *are* liable, but they are only liable civilly (read: money).  you cannot throw a corp in jail.  you cannot throw a ceo in jail because of the corporate veil.  again not saying anything new here, regulation allows us to do exactly that.  it pierces the corporate veil for only the most egregious acts, such as sourcing ketchup from a landfill.  
don't you think at least more than one person should have gone to jail for the 2007 housing crash?  we are suffering the effects for 10 years going now and *one* person went to jail.  why?  we repealed regulation which specifically disallowed repackaging risky assets.  the same regulation that stopped it when it happened in the past (in the 1900s, 1910s and 1920s to be exact).  
ergo, my thesis still holds.. we need regulation to ensure the push-pull leans in the direction of "good" capitalism.

everyone is attacking me as if i am 100% wrong, the problem is there have been many "fundamental breakthroughs" in algorithms.  i mean in the 60s people said there's no way we could scale to memory sizes were are at today because of error rates and unless there was a breakthrough in mathematics it would never be possible.  enter ECC.

In the context of crippling internet traffic, 60 second TTL is stupid.  Not only is it a DDOS event waiting to happen.  With low TTLs you can almost be assured that a large percentage of clients will ignore your TTL and default to a higher value against your wishes.  Your DNS resolver and every upstream resolver caches DNS queries for a reason. 
Which just brings out common sense questions.. You are a p2p network, why can't you round robin your dns on a TTL of 300 or more?  Are your nodes really only alive for less than 5 minutes?  Because that is botnet activity, not normal p2p network activity.  Also, a TTL of 300 seconds doesn't mean you cannot update your records in less than 300 second intervals.
[also, cache poisoning is possible with low TTLs](

We have started a blockchain analysis service to help assist companies who wish to accept 0 confirmation transactions.  Transactions that are processed with our system can be analyzed through over 500 transactions.  We have engineers that have worked at netflix, comcast, google and bing who have phds and have worked heavily on relevance in the past. 
While our goal is for 0 confirmation transactions, we have increased interest and a lot of clients who work in the financial field.  (Some of which have no public bitcoin or cryptocurrency plans which we find interesting).  As of this year we added 20 altcoins.
Some interesting points:
 - We warehouse over 150GB of transactional data
 - We process in realtime and offer an SLA of 100ms
 - We can cross reference bitcoin, altcoin blockchains, as well as external data sources
 - We are distributed across the US and EU and are looking to expand to China, Australia and Japan for worldwide coverage
 - You have probably indirectly used our system without knowing

github stores all of your revisions in a relational database of your choosing, oracle, msql, mysql, postgresql.  gitlabs, the community edition, by default uses postgresql.  
you could, in theory, pull your php code out of a gitlab sqldb and load it directly as a page.  there is absolutely nothing wrong with this and actually provides a bit of security, if through obscurity.  for instance, what if I told you LDAP could be used to store this sort of information.  crazy right? except LDAP is designed for read performance.  and is the exact reason why Active Directory uses LDAP to store DNS zone information rather than a SQL based backend.

The developers are stagnant and slow.  This conversation was brought up waaay before e.g. the Strict DER implementation.  Please tell me why the Block Size debate has less importance than removing Core's reliance on OpenSSL?  Seriously. Yes, this makes bitcoin core portable but what projects are demanding this requirement?  None.  And so the development team over at Core, amidst the corruption and scandal of the foundation being bankrupt, need to remain at the forefront of Bitcoin.  I have asked every developer directly in this sub about that very same point (why strict der vs block increase) and the answer was always the same "because we need to create a portable bitcoin core and the blocksize debate has at least a few more years blah blah". (you with the archive, go check it out)
Let's face it, the blocksize is the death kneel for bitcoin.  We all know we can't go to 20MB blocks without major issues.  Even 8MB is too large.  There seems to be mostly a consensus of a 2MB increase from people in both the  Gavin/Mike and BIP100 camps.  But we just yoyo back to the original problem, the devs of core can't come to an agreement.  And those who are voicing concerns have a financial motivation to their position, *even if indirectly*.  Normally the foundation would be like Lead Developer, collect votes, the votes say this, lets implement.  But when you have developers who's votes outweigh the others to simply turn bitcoin into political grandstanding (yes the drama with the new chairman is still ongoing) you get turmoil.
TL;DR: XT should be core.  XT is not core because of an anti-agenda within core to avoid a lot of items which were (quickly, might i add) developed outside of the hive mind mentality. XT should be BIP100.  the fundamental goals are the same.  Core should be both XT and BIP100 but can't because core developers can't learn to play together.

If you ever have a warrant out for your arrest, you can typically walk into your local precinct and turn yourself in.  Or you can go and sit before the judge to contest your warrant, but with the knowledge that you may very well not walk out of that courtroom.
It's typical for CEOs because they have the funds for lawyers.  Lawyers generally stay on top of shit like arrest warrants.  As less city, state, or federal resources result in lower punishments (you plea and save the court 2 years of litigation, they may give you 50% of your sentence on probation etc), CEO lawyers will recommend going in and serving your time.

i don't understand the logic in this sub.  it's impossible to store because trillions of combinations and maths!  and it will always be protected in the future by things like 20MB blocks because computing power, network bandwidth and storage will continue to increase!  Bitcoin Core 0.11 is moving 10GB/day, can you imagine that 5 years ago?!
no. and now you are here and you cannot imagine that a rainbow table of btc private keys is possible in the future.  i will also add that in 1998 rainbow tables of NT password hashes were thought to be impossible.  **4 years later** not only did we have rainbow tables to crack Windows LanMan passwords, but we had found a collision in MD5 space AND created rainbow tables to exploit MD5 collisions.  It's happening today with SHA1 and will likely happen to SHA2 tomorrow (in the figurative sense)

Dude, I am a computer scientist and even I think bitcoin is not revolutionary.  Evolutionary, yes.  The concept of a blockchain will be used for years to come, particularly for DRM or payment settlement (or smart contracts in cryptocurrency speak).  Not to replace a world's reserve currency.  It does *not* solve the problems of fiat and would *create* more problems for governments if it were to replace a national currency.  Simply look back to 1930s USA for a prime example of the exact same problem.
Seriously, there are many papers from respected economics and computer scientists who all describe the problems of crypto as a large scale currency.

Um, isn't making something illegal a form of censorship?  So what you are saying is it is not really resistant of being made illegal if you are just ignoring the law and still committing an illegal act.  In an extreme example, laws against murder is censorship but it's a small technical hurdle to dump someone in the middle of the ocean, never to be found again.

Having just returned from Venezuela I can speak authoritatively here!
Please remember that Venezuela is highly dependent on the price of oil.  The OPEC attack on the US shale operation has directly impacted our income. If you look at the history of Venezuela, American oil companies came in and pretty much looted the land.  They gave something like 3% of profits back to the country.  This did not help the country prosper and eventually the state nationalized the foreign companies against the American and Btitish company's wishes.  This created strained international relations that has never been fixed.  Since then, most of the country's policies have been continued to be mismanaged.
While it is great we are bringing awareness to my country's plight, please do not think that pumping BTC will help fix the problem.  There is much more deeprooted cryonism that needs to be fixed.  I seriously fear that BTC will cause additional problems around the economic situation, most notably with the elderly population as well as those who do not live in Caracas or any other large city.  More than likely more the illegal USD trade will become greater, as you can easily transport and use USD across country lines to neighboring countries or the caribbean islands for sale and trade for goods.  *no one else around Venezuela accepts BTC in any kind of meaingful way*

I fully agree, execpt China has capital controls which restrict the purchase of BTC in amounts of hand over first.  In otherwords, it is like saying every Chinese citizen has a 5000¥ weekly withdrawal/purchase limit and it goes up based on factors that only the Chinese financial ministries allow in order to protect the currency for the citizens in the middle of nowhere who have no connection to the bubble (or bitcoin for that matter) 
(and no i don't think the regulations are truly protecting the citizens but not entirely sure a 100% conversion to btc is the answer either -- likely some sort of diversification is in order but to what extent is not a topic of discussion for this sub.. maybe or can speak to that in greater detail)

*we are overpopulating the planet* so we need to find something to do with the extra people.  so we throw them in jail.  we kill a few of them.  we turn our heads when other countries violate human rights issues.  switching to bitcoin will also begin to take control of the population.  this is also why switching to bitcoin will be near impossible, because the ignorant masses will figure out it's a system that cannot be cheated, that cannot grow dynamically, cannot allow governments to provide welfare or medicare benefits, and ultimately will not use something that is not easy to use.  caring about a BIP proposal that could directly effect their money TODAY is not the same as the fed's talking about raising interest rates.  as far as the ignorant masses are concerned, things are no different today than they were 10 years ago (except today there are new people who are rich) or even 20 years ago when interest rates were &gt; 7%.  *they still think one day they will be that rich person* when in reality it is you or me taking their money (whether it be fiat or bitcoin) and laughing to the bank.  many other things will come to head (race, gender, and financial inequality/government supression e.g. TSA, FDA, IRS/natural disasters,global warming) before bitcoin becomes a **blip** on a worldwide radar.  because realistically it's been 5 years and Apple Pay already has more users/transactions.

I don't know if you realize, but performance is always going to get better not worse.  At this point performance is remaining the same to increase power efficiency. 
What is wrong with sloppy code if you have virtually unlimited RAM?  As someone who helped write sendmail, I can assure you the bitcoin code base and entire fundamental idea of PoW is sloppy and inefficient.  But at what point do you draw the line.  An ecosystem that relies on machines which do nothing but consume energy?  Or your handheld computing device?
I'm not saying the Pi doesn't have a place much like the Intel Celeron had for a long time.  But don't try to use a simple argument of writing sloppy code in a sub where the entire argument is to consume as much cpu, ram, and storage as possible to ensure security.

Why don't you take them to small claims court?
EDIT: Although they did say twice that bank of america is in posession of the funds while it clears and that the hold is part of the process of depositing a check.  It may be fruitful for you to reread those phamplets they gave you when you initially opened the account.  I bet in the terms of services they spell out that a paper check can be held for up to 15 days and during that time the funds will not be made available to you.  Further down they probably spell out what causes fees such as the NSF fee and it is probably defined as not having sufficient funds in your account.  Those two possible terms could cause this exact situation you are in right now.  You may be fighting a battle against a smart contract that was spelled out to you when you opened the account...
EDIT2: Uh oh.  [Pages 16 and 20]( It was spelled out to you right there in the agreement.  I don't get how you were robbed when their smart contract was explained in writing before you began using the account.  Even if this were a bitcoin smart contract, BOA would not have any recourse because of the computing power protecting the blockchain.

Yes, because your argument is that it has a high rate of inflation.  It's high rate of inflation has been recent and is likely temporary.  Comparing it to bitcoin which is only a recent currency that has only had a high rate of inflation is no better than the brazalian "fun bucks" you claim no one wants.  
So I am to take the word of a random Internet stranger that a currency that has been fine for the last 50+ years is suddenly on the out because it's inflation rate has temporarily matched that of magic Internet money which will continue to have a high inflation rate for the next few years.  The same exact measure which you claim makes the Brazilian currency unwanted.
I know you can't imagine what the world will be like in 5 months, but just try for a moment.  Are you saying it is impossible for the inflation rate of Brazilian dollars to lower?  That is why you need to provide citations.  Because as someone who has witnessed many world currencies inflate and deflate, your argument ("lol because the writing is on the wall because I said so, DON'T QUESTION ME!!!") is one of the stupidest ones I have ever heard

LOL you asked for "monies that have lasted 100 years".  I provide you examples including the French Franc, a money which has lasted for 100 years.  A Franc was denoted in metals back in the 1300s when it was first debuted.  Today a Franc can still be denoted in metal (coin) but also in paper.  Ergo, the French Franc today would mean the same as a French Franc in the 1400s.  The only difference is the value of Franc has changed and will continue to change as things such as, *human population growth* continues to require additional monies to support a civilzation.  
For the record, the united states was the last country to switch from the gold standard as it was (shock and surprise!) inhibiting growth.  As our population continues to grow, our monetary system will continue to adapt.  Oh what am I saying, this entirely requires thought which you claim I do not do.
Anyway, still waiting for you to show me that data where the Brazilian Citizens do not want Brazilian currency.  Or this is another example of you not thinking... I cannot tell anymore.

murder is not victimless.  a lot of the creation of the drugs on silkroad is also not victimless.  just because the buyers are middle class well-to-do folk doesn't mean the people who cook the meth or crack are...

banks also need to have at least a $1m surety bond in addition to at least $10m in reserves (depending on your total deposits, but that's the entry level req) and that's in addition to other bank regulations.  the idea is if the bank makes an egregious faux-paus, that $11m will be used to  correct their problem.  also serves as incentive for banks to not fuck up.  
banks also want FDIC for consumers (if you walked into your bank and it suddenly didn't have FDIC insurance you would probably run screaming.. see 2007 as an example).  FDIC has regulations and more requirements you must adhere to.  
so yes, banks do this everyday because of the regulations they must follow.  but hey i'm all for repealing regulations and watching another meltdown (glass-steagall, y'all)

It depends on your architecture.
Voat may very well scale nicely due to it's reliance on the .net framework.  If they are using the azure platform they are almost gauranteed to scale vertically and horizontally, so long as they don't do stupid things in their code.  Rails, for instance, scales vertically very well but does not scale horizontally well.  PHP on the other hand is great at scaling horizontally but sucks going vertical.  
Now this very high level, but there are many solutions to making a design scale even if it's an after thought.
Source: I come from a background in distributed programming and clustered supercomputing.  My work was in the top500 supercomputer list in 2002 and I have contributed many times over to MPI and the Infiniband Linux project.  So trust me when I say, there are solutions to additional monitoring and maintenance and even though HE may fuck it up, HE likely has access to many platforms, services, and consultants who can manage the very thing you don't think he can handle.

And what, besides all out financial collapse and Armageddon, do you need to prove that fiat is unsustainable (since that is also an open question)?
Also, bitcoin is highly unsustainable, largely manipulated, lacks transparency on anything offchain that people use everyday (ChangeTip, Coinbase, etc) and quite possible offer fractional reserve banking (OKCoin) without your knowledge.  Then, if you just look at it from a "protect the network" viewpoint, it's an even more unsustainable resource consumer.  I mean when energy is diverted from poor chinese towns to a bitcoin mining center, then you have to question what is considered sustainable practicies.

Maybe not.  Gold and other metals are great stores of value when shit hits the fan.  2008 was a prime example of shit hitting the fan, the entire world was ready to be impacted by the actions of global empires. Gold = very safe.  We do not have that sort of diasaster on our hands.  Yes there is credit debt swaps, but that those are not held nearly as widely as property is.  Yes there is the greek trouble, but that is being salvaged by QE EU edition (free money yo, invest overseas to get some free EUR funbucks that can buy cold hard bitcoins).  Even China's problem doesn't affect the global economy (US economy yes, but not global. e.g. Saudi Arabia and Russia won't cry when China shits the bed).
Therefore, there is no real reason for the price of gold to be so high. You can validate this by tracking stock market volitility. VXX is a good indicator.  When volitlity is up, gold and metals will follow.  We are currently riding on smooth waters and USD is leading the pack.
TL;DR: USD is more liquid, has more opportunities for growth (esp when we start paying interest on our dollars), so we are back in the era of Cash is king for the next 3-4 years until the QE EU edition bubble pops.  By then USD may very well surpass EUR

and once again, having a TTL of 300 seconds does not mean you cannot update your records in less than 300 second intervals.  a TTL directs your DNS resolver, on the system you are currently using, to cache the query response for a minimum of 300 seconds.   when you reboot your router at home, you are aware of this limitation and can take one of two options.  you could wait the 5 minutes.  but since you would rather not do that, you could flush your dns cache.  
    ipconfig /flushdns

We, america, also want our dollar to be the most powerful dollar.  In order to be powerful, we need people to use our dollars.  We incentivize people to use our dollars by paying them interest.  Yes, you as an American are affected but at the same time you, as an American, don't have to worry about e.g. oil being sold in euros completely fucking you and your neighbors in the ass.  You, as an American, will not have problem finding jobs as the higher interest means more monetary velocity in the stock markets which translates to companies keeping employement numbers up.  If you are smart, you would realize that your dollar will be getting weaker and you negoiate a higher salary.

Why should that be true [when software is not considered free speech](
The source code is free speech, you can print that in books, on tshirts, shout it in a public square if you wanted.  The minute you start shouting binary code (distribution) it's no longer conisdered free speech.  Oddly enough you know what allowed for this to happen?  DeCSS, which is software specifically designed to *break* smart contracts.

"Inflation loss"
Let's play by the numbers because, you know, math don't lie.
my net worth (assets - liabilities) is $450k.  Excluding the checking account, my combined gain is currently 17%.  So lets look at this great reason not to give 20k to inflation loss.  Inflation has been mostly [pegged at 2%]( yet again.  So over the course of a 12 month period my 20k has actually turned into $19600 ($20000 * 0.98).  Compared to my 17% gain on 430k (of which, 20k is less than 5% (20/430)) I can say that I have a very great reason.
I can say that a 2% loss on 5% of my worth is perfectly acceptable for the freedom to know that I have $20k cash available in the event of an emergency, job loss, lightening strike, surprise baby, etc.

The fact that the *IRS classified* Bitcoin has no relevance on the fact that using Bitcoin in that manner is considered money laundering.

I agree with everything up to this paragraph.  Bittorrent indirectly (different developers/companies involved) spawned from gnutella's concept.  A completely decentralized file sharing network.  Then the devs realized you need centralization and suddenly we have Bittorrent + DHT.  Blockchain is no different.  Bitcoin is MASSIVELY inefficient at the perk of being entirely decentralized (except you have centralization happening in mining and usd &lt;-&gt; btc exchanges atm).  The federal reserve is an example of massive centralization to the point of inefficiency.  You will find a balance between the two.

email is not secure.  it is inherently insecure because it is modeled after UUCP.  we have added secureish features on top such as STARTTLS and SSL, but those do not make the protocol secure. (e.g. you can have an encrypted session to your first SMTP server but each additional SMTP server does not require encrypted communication).  If you say GPG or PGP, then you are just layering a secure messaging system ontop of an insecure transport.


and what is going to provide incentive for the creation of these larger and faster pipes to enable the higher bandwidth?  if we use bitcoin and take control of money away from the government, how can projects like the internet even exist (remember it required heavy subsidization from the government)

This seems like the most likely route sanctioned cryptocurrencies will go.  The government will take on creating the hashrate and create a closed pool.  How much does the current bitcoin hashrate cost?  NASA has a bigger budget, it wouldn't take much for a soverign nation to take on the work themselves.  However America's monetary system is quasi-public, meaning an american cryptocurrency will likely be 'owned' by the federal reserve in a manner similar to central banks.

Yes yes it entirely does matter.  Banks are required to file a SAR if they found you were depositing a large number of blacklisted serial numbers.  Hello police investigation, hello possible connection to bank robbery.  Notice at no time did I say you were arrested or charged.  But your life at the very least could be made hell by the legal harassment of detectives doing their job.  It's better to just avoid this.
And i'm not talking about $200 from a blacklisted batch. I'm saying if you deposit 10-20% of the blacklisted bills and they are all close in ordering of each other it makes you a suspect.  Once enough information is gathered you very well could be arrested and have to stand trial to maintain your innocence.  The evidence could be so damning, even if only coincidental, that a jury of your peers convict you.

No.  I am not When $50k or more is on the line I can spend $8000 on a lawyer to make sure my license is solid.  But maybe you live in fantasy world where licenses are written by the whim of a help desk technician.  Literally what the fuck is your argument there?  Of course the license would explicitly state the terms of use.  It's no different from using oracle, windows, or fucking reddit.
2) exactly because there are no regulations is why institutional money is taking so long to enter the bitcoin scene.  Tangential example, the mariuajana situation in Colorado and washington.  Banks are not touching them because laws are murky and they could be charged with money laundering because of interpretation of the law.

what do you define as wild west?  i think bitcoin was in a period of wild west, just like internet telecom was in the mid 90s.  as the ponzi schemes, thefts, and "innovative products" (read: financial packages using virtual currencies instead of real currencies) have proved is that the government was watching to ensure these things wouldn't be created.  but the free market (and its wild wild west attitude) brought "investors" who thought building a darknet market would be tolerated.  During these periods, no one wants to invest and those that do do so carefully (see the dotcom era or hell go back to my housing bubble example).  Ultimately someone tries to get rich using sleezy and manipulative actions which causes the government to come in with a banhammer.  
What are those regulations?  I have no clue so you look kinda silly thinking I have some explicit regulation in my mind.  However I do know that glass-steagall had criminal penalties associated with people who conspired to package toxic products as AAA+ financial vehicles.  That is an explicit regulation that makes you pause even if you are selling them as A-rated financial vehicles because of exactly what you talk about.. regulatory uncertainty.    
That same uncertainty I did not want to live through because my neighbors were pulling all the equity out of their house to build half a pool, or begin adding on to their house, or gut their kitchen before the market crashes and they just walk away.  They walk away while my house value plummets when I just wanted a nice neighborhood to raise my kids.  But i'm sure that's just as fair as the greedy bankers who walked away with the TARP money too.

If google had remained a private company and did not take on so many investors, it would likely have started a bank as they have more than enough money to do so (you need $10mil on average to open a bank in most jurisdictions.  that is just the reserves,  there are also operating [personnel , licensing, rent, etc] expenses per branch).  Since, today, Google has many investors and a duty to perform, a bank would be seen as a waste since partnering with an established bank would cost many magnitudes less than "rolling their own".

Jesus you are slow.  Ubuntu does try to fork the common distribution whose whole value relies on being unique.  
Let me spell it out for you because you still are not grasping.  Debian has a full common package system which relies on being unique.  Ubuntu relies upon that same common package system but then alters it as it sees fit.  This means you cannot always take a package from Debian and install it on Ubuntu or vice versa.  
What does that sound like, bitcoin vs bitcoinxt?  I.e. A software fork.  Or are you going to go on about a database and ignore the fact that you can fork code and run it and the world doesn't explode.

But in reality those who are caught up in civil forfeiture are those who are doing something else which is illegal.  The random stories you hear about a family business or grandparents house are very random and almost always include a direct or indirect criminal act.  It is called trumping up charges to enhance plea deals, if you plea they likely drop the civil forfeiture case.  
As an example I have, in the past, withdrawn $2500 from an ATM over the span of 5 days.  I have withdrawn $6k in cash from one account to deposit into another (as the bank teller told me, it's faster and far cheaper to walk the money to the other bank *around the corner* than it is to wire it).  I have withdrawn and deposited a total of $12k into a single account in a single day.  And I have never had anything seized, but probably a few SARs filed against me (again nothing came from it).
TL;DR: banks file SARs for anything suspicious (**S**uspicious **A**ctivity **R**eport) including multiple ATM deposits and withdrawals to find petty drug dealers

hi i have worked for soundscan.  they literally only accept sales reports from vendors that sells music.  every vendor must jump through hoops just to get their sales data accepted.  up until recently it was based on scanning a physical barcode which was correlated with the artist or label's data of shipping inventory.  lately it includes online downloads but also requires a deep inspection of a company's orifice to ensure the downloads are of a legitimate origin and not allmp3s.ru or sonybmduniversal.com

this same thing happens during fires, car accidents, and floods.  a lot of the time its because the person thinks "it's okay *i have insurance*" not realizing that tailgating 1/2 car length will put them at fault which insurance won't pay out for (or will after jacking up your rates).  accidentally fell asleep with a cigarette in your mouth?  they will pay for your cars and jewelry and other simple belongings that are covered but good luck fighting to get that brand new fridge replaced or seeing anything near whats worth in your closet or of your computer stash.  you could pay more money to be blindly covered (e.g. they give you a check worth 60% of your loss rather than 20%) but if you never use that policy you will have thrown out all of that money and then some over the life of your policy.  basically how much you fight to get from your insurance directly relates to the actuary tables that you will be a higher risk in the future and thus premiums go up accordingly
as you said, always your best bet is to self-insure.  raise your deductible as you put aside savings to cover the deductible.  e.g. my health insurance used to be $120/month for me and my wife (not a company sponsered plan) with a $15k deductible.  then we had a kid.  now our insurance is $500/month with a $1500 deductible.  but not before i saved $36k etc
its as simple as what they said in fight club.  if the cost to fight you is less than the cost of lawyers and an extended lawsuit, they will fight you.  it's life, you would do the same thing if you were in a similar situation (read to see what i mean)

How quickly we forgot the repeal of glass-steagall.  You know the regulations that criminalized and protected our economy from bankers creating bad-faith financial products.  How quickly we forget people screaming saying Glass-Steagall will cause liquidity to dry up and force undue regulations on banks and private sectors alike.  70 years they screamed this everyone else saying 'haha yea right'..  and then it was relaxed.  And then 2006 came and went,  then 2008, now we're at 2015 and dodd-frank still isn't in place.
Yea, lets laugh at how regulations will never be relaxed when we can't remember the things that happened 10 years ago.  I am personally keeping my BTC stash silent until regulations are relaxed again (they always are, just look at the telecom industry [law preventing mabell from leasing phones.. now we have cell phone contracts] or the software industry [law preventing microsoft from including IE without default alternatives.. now we have google/chrome phones and apple/safari phones] for other examples) and then I'm making my ultimate exit


I don't cry out for the government to run my life.  I know how to save and invest wisely, however I do cry out for the government to put some controls in so others don't ruin my life.  I knew the housing bubble was coming, others believed it will grow for ever.  If I don't cry out for my government to interject and step into others lives then my life will be ruined by foreclosures all around me, economic recession, etc.  Part of my life may be controlled by the government but this is to be expected (0% interest rates suck but compared to the potential of a massive depression, i'll take the pain of 0% interest rates, alex).  So yea, I will expect some government intervention so I don't have to worry about where I am getting food tomorrow because all of my neighbors went 2x over their heads in his or her mortgage and are willing to walk away and live on food stamps because they can't fathom macroeconomics...

isn't the blockchain just information?  but you have a notion of *owning* bitcoins.   so you can entirely own information
i would think if your contract says don't copy or allow said software to be copied and then you have a massive breach of your datacenter **and the software is copied**.. you become liable for damages because you broke the contract.  what are the damages?  well by monitoring torrents you can see at least 500 people have downloaded your software so that's 500 licenses you owe in damages. at least.  at 50k per software package (because the only way you sell the software is with a support pack as well) damages due become $25m.  now i'm sure you don't have this kind of money, so i make a deal with you.
i should stop here and ask if you are familiar with [the doctrine of subrogation](  in exchange for not owing me $25m, you could grant me the rights to go after YOUR attackers to collect my money due from illegal ownership of my ware.  even though information is "out of my control" as you put it, it is still well within my control because my software comes with a license.  in order to use my software, you need to accept the license.  you are not allowed to accept the license if you did not e.g. pay for the software.  ergo your continued use of the software is a breach of that contract.  just as you cannot say "uhhh sorry judge i didn't know the speed limit is not 55 in a school zone" the judge will say go to drivers ed and fine and possibly jail you.  same with violating a software license.
and with smart contracts information is effectively finite and reproducible only to the selected few

it is simply an altcoin that is federally sanctioned and embedded into banking services with little change to the end user.  then gateways ala bitpay appear which allow an api and tokens very similar to that of every cryptocurrency out there.  maybe they borrow a little from eth, from namecoin, or other popular alts.  maybe they also expand and enhance bitcoins best characteristics.  the point is, while you are sitting here shouting "it's only an altcoin!" the rest of the world is using fedcoin and you are forced to make the switch only way later after the "early adopters" made bank on the free inflation for helping pre-mine the fedchain.

you are missing the point.  the idea was that the software was not open and you had slaved over it for a few years which cumulated with a potential sale of $10m wiped out because they already had your software which you had spent years making to sell for food for your family.
unless you think all software and creative works should be free and open to the world, in that case you probably don't like the concept of capitalistic america and are welcome to try out places like e.g. Cuba, Venuzela or most of Soviet Russia.
so please continue to focus on stealing vs infringing, but in the end we all can agree money was lost (you had to spend time to put together the 10m deal, you had to spend time to create the software, you had to spend time to find lawyers, etc etc).  of course, again, if you don't believe money should be spent on these things then this post is of no concern to you and you can just ignore it!

That is not how prior art works.
For instance, how do you know the authors of said content have not been contacted by Bank of America Corporation and offered a royalty settlement?  The data can remain available to the public but that doesn't change the fact that now BAC owns the prior art rights.  Who's going to challenge on their prior art?  Someone who made derivative works on the prior art?  That means you're admitting to using the prior art.  Which BAC has a patent for.  Meaning they can compel a court to turn royalty payments over to you.  Even if you are a 20 or 30something year old mom or pop that only has $50k in savings.  Don't think so?  Look at the RIAA or at SCO or any other linux patent trolls out there.  
Not FUD, but real life.  Now will BAC come after a good-to-do mother and father? Most probably not.  But you startup a company using blockchain tech to maybe create a raw transaction generator.  Guess who's going to come knocking for a cut of their patent?  Or maybe you're broke so they'll just require that you use their Crypto Gateway to the Blockchain.

Gold was played really well, it was an entire pump and dump  (as in, it was entirely gold speculators which sent the price rising, notice how no one redeemed gold when fan hit the shit in 2008).
Oil speculators ravaged oil back in 2008 as well.  We can't say speculation killed oil this time around, we legitimately are exporting a higher percentage of oil now and we (the usa) are causing problems with OPECs around the world.  But this is offtopic.
If you bought gold at $1920 and did not sell until $1200, you are no smarter than who bought  btc at $1200 and are still hodling now.

That solution is fine.  Until then what is wrong with regulation?  We have laws which help stop people from dabbling in the art of murder.  Why is it wrong to, in the interim, have extremely strict regulations which carry crushing fines and extensive criminal sentences.  The reason why the laws are skirted currently is because they are very vague and weak and left open to interpretation.  Dodd-frank is a shell of glass-steagall.  Why did we even allow the repeal of glass-steagall? We never had a crisis of toxic financial vehicles while it was in place because it promised jail time of multiple decades.  Dodd frank does not recommend jail time for most acts which lead to the 2008 debacle.
I don't think we need to rush into e.g. decentralized bitcoin when we have controls that have been proven to work.  We can take time to allow bitcoin to evolve and when ready (like being able to handleore than 3 tx/s lol) then we migrate there.  In the meantime, **we need strict regulation to prevent bad actors**
Also food for thought, we do not see any corruption occurring on us based exchanges.  Two things to note. 1) the regulatory climate is much stricter here and 2) there are very limited regulations surrounding virtual currencies which limits insituational funding.

wouldn't items have to come down in price so someone who now has .000000001 can afford something that costs .00000001 which was not previously affordable (not enough pieces)?
i mean what would be the point of having .00000000000000000051718 bitcoins if the price is still .00014872 BTC?
and this is assuming BTC is the reserve currency, if BTC is not, then wouldn't it float against the reserve?  e.g. 1 BTC = $200, but now we have added another decimal so 1 BTC = $20 to adjust for the additional pieces that people are expected to use.
or are we saying that prices will still be 0.00014872 BTC and people will just be fucked and unable to buy things but hey at least they have 0.00000000000000000051718 BTC

I passed by a gas station that was selling gas at $1.81 this morning.  The dollar is deflating and since China owns the largest amount of USD, they are feeling and seeing the effects of deflation first hand.  Why is this bad for BTC?  Well, why buy BTC at all when you can wait for prices to drop to buy more (doesn't this sound like a familiar argument with bitcoin itself?).  Same with Oil, same with Corn, same with water.  Ergo, prices drop.  But this is bad because we have lots and lots of USD out there.  So while the major holders are hodling, common folk like you and me can purchase gas and food another commodities for cheap. Once we have enough food and gas for cheap, we will too stop buying as much and that will cause prices to go even further.  Including BTC prices.
With that said, BTC is following world commodities right now as people reallocate their portfolios.

Hijacking this thread to LOL but also point out that while this is technically truth, the transfer of information cannot be faster than the speed of light.  Depending on the state of the objects, the state could be observed before you received information to determine the probability of a set of states.  This is why you first need to reduce your dataset by conventional means.  So you have two problematic vectors, conventional computing being able to isolate a dataset in a determenistic fashion, and quantum computing advances as larger qubit systems are deployed to increase attack rate.

Gavin Andersen making $200k is not a standout number of exuberance to you??  The same Gavin Andersen with how many thousands of bitcoins?

Also, why haven't you implemented checks for fraudsters?  We get those same rejections but we clearly state why they are declined (e.g. in your case the 3rd order would have blocked them and opened a ticket AND inform the user suspicous activity has banned them).  As someone in the ecommerce game for over 15 years now, it is better (read: cheaper) to have a fraudster call you than to have a fradulent charge go through/  Until bitcoin is a household name, I don't see how bitcoin makes life any better for consumers (you know the people we need to visit our stores)

You are comparing bitcoin to airplanes.  But I could use an equally apt comparison.  Bitcoin could be like DIVX.  DIVX did not scale.  
or how about, Bitcoin could be like HD-DVD.  HD-DVD did not scale.
or how about, Bitcoin could be like pets.com.  pets.com did not scale.
So yea you can point at things that have succeeded today, but you can just as well point to things that did not succeed.  We are still waiting for bitcoin's killer app.  Kinda like how rolls royce invented the killer app for gliders...  or maybe you could look at it another way and say gliders did not scale and corporate entities (read: boeing, lockheed, airbus, et al) took over and removed the power of flight from the common folk.  yes you can still rent a glider but it is prohibitively more expensive than flying on an intercontinental airliner..
also if you are going to use an example that clearly depends upon physics, we knew birds could fly in 1903.  as time went on we realized the same principals worked with larger values.  bitcoin is also dependent upon physics, as it will consume more and more electricity to ensure stability.  energy will continue to become more expensive.  that creates two slopes with an intersection sometime in the future indicating the do-or-die point of bitcoin.

to fake this makes life very expensive very quickly (to stop big labels from cheating the system), but this same expense is why indie labels typically do not make it to the top 40, however the youtube and free music charts are much more friendly to independent artists (even if there are easy ways to cheat that system).

look into why you should never reuse the same address.  when you direct unspent outputs to a new wallet address, the "dust" (small amounts of btc) typically moves into this change address.  so you can track where that btc goes.  it's the same way the stolen evolution, mtgox, bitstamp, and dpr's funds were tracked

How about ask the question why [Russia, and China](  and  in terms of oil ouput, both of which could easily woo countries such as kazhekstan and brazil to become the dominant oil producers) also do not sell their oil for euros?  Kinda puts a shitty break to your oil for euros argument.

Just want to make sure you are talking about criminal trials here.  Civil trials do not have the same burden of proof, jury trials are restricted to serious damages, etc.
In criminal law, and the fundamental idea behind our judicial system is that justice is blind.  This means justice goes into each and every trial with zero idea of a guilty or not guilty verdict. All the facts must be presented and interpretation of law must be established.  The idea of a peer is someone who is a person, like you.  You could very well meet the 12 people on the jury pool by luck (highly unlikely but play along) and become friends with them even if they have different social norms, cultural background etc. That is the legal definition of a peer.  Not someone who you play basketball and have known for 15 years. 
Instead of having a benevolent dictator decide your fate, 12 random people are to decide your fate and recommend sentencing but only if they are unanimous in their decision.  This is why the facts need to be presented from scratch as if the jury as 10 year olds.  I know nothing about hair braiding and might kneejerk into the same reaction you have.  However the jury would hear from the prosecutors how they found over $16m of damages caused by unlicensed hair professionals.  $16m is a lot for a local county, I would hope my county is doing something to prevent that.  Ah, thats why there are licenses for hair braiding.  Silly but its for the greater good.
I think the problem you have with this whole ordeal is that you do not find it to be intuitive or that you have a better idea of how to hold a court case.  The problem is the judicial system is designed to not be overthrown without checks and balances.  This helps prevent corruption that exists in eg the executive and legislative branches.  While judges and prosecutors can be paid off, it's much much harder to pay off 12 jurors.  All you need is 1 dissenting opinion and boom the trial is over.  BECAUSE OF THIS, making a change would require a trial in the very same courts.  Which ultimately plays out that the existing system works perfectly fine.
As an example of my last part, look at the Martin-Zimmerman case.  Zimmerman was completely within the purview of the law in his actions, but those prosecutor 'thugs' presented 'facts' which the 'jury' interpreted as not a violation of the law.  The hope on the prosecution side was that the jury would make a change, find Zimmerman guilty and thus establish case law against standing your ground.  Except the jury agreed that Zimmerman very well was standing his ground (evidenced by a dead man who can't speak, zimmerman alive and able to speak, and no witnesses).  Did zimmerman violate someone's rights?  Very possibly.  Should we jail anyone who shoots to kill?  No. And that's what the jury helped solidify in this case.
But i'm sure you're going to come back with something about how Ross Ulbricht deserved a better trial etc etc when in reality the jury heard everything maybe even felt bad for him for a little bit and then saw the full scope of what he was doing and said no one man should have all this power.  And thus continues America's freedom to implement checks and balances.
Have you ever served on a jury for something more important than a traffic offense or misdemeanor drug charge?

are you a merchant?  i am a merchant and let me tell you.  when $600k is flowing in, you don't give a damn about settlement.  ask i'm sure he knows this very well.  i would say that we stopped caring about "settlements" when we started turning $3000/month.  i very quickly realized how easy it is for a merchant to bring in $3k/month.  having an auditable record that you can go click-click-quickbooks that is provided as a free service (i mean it is exactly like the blockchain.. if i wanted to fill out the name, category, location, etc manually for each settlement) is worth more than any magic internet money that i can send across the world even though i don't know anyone on the other side of the world that i couldn't connect with via a simple email.

i don't think you get it.   i have to pay fees with bitcoin (you claim it's 0.05 today but what happens when the inflation drops to &lt; 1%, fees should theoretically rise to $5 when the blockreward goes to 0 BTC).  and if we want to move goal posts on things that matter to the cash flow for merchants, what about training of bitcoin and the new software employees must use.  that is a real cost that has a non-zero number.  i may luck out and hire someone that's heard of bitcoin but please tell me what people i can hire for the same payrate today that knows bitcoin that exists everywhere i have a physical store front.
i want  my consumers to be allowed chargebacks without having to setup escrow or other crazy multisig solutions.  we actually put leg work into reducing fradulent charges and maximizing customer experience.  if you are hit with chargebacks in this day and age, then that's your own damn fault.
so once again, cash flow is not an issue if i am actually trying to run a business, nor is chargeback and fees (they get passed onto the customer).  as a merchant, what do i gain with bitcoin?

you do realize that other currencies went full fiat well before "nixon shock".. do you?  meaning maybe your average lifespan for fiat currency is not an accurate number (i.e. citation needed).  food for thought: it's been 60 years since the average life span was 65 years old.  now it's above 75.  should we still say they average lifespan for humans are 65?  or should we account for the changes in e.g. technology which enables a longer average lifespan.  if so for humans, why not also for fiat currencies (which are well beyond the 28 year average right now)

What about China's exchange of oil for African nation's natural resources?  Is this something no one cares about, but suddenly we care because Gaddafi decided to do the same thing?  Or is the whole Gaddafi thing a completely different argument all together (destabilize the region to bring more moderate power to the middle east)


So why doesn't russia sell in euro? If they aren't trying to undermine global oil trade, why are they affected by oil sanctions and working to undo those sanctions?


Why do we want Syria, again?  For their oil?  Or for stability of the region?  To me it seems you are exchanging the word oil for stability in your mind but then your words come out reading oil.  Oil is what they, your handlers, want you to focus on.  Look deeper.


That BS about Saddam going to sell Oil for Euros. 
You still don't get that Iraq had zero to do with what saddam was doing and everything that saddam wasn't doing.  Saddam was not selling oil, specifically to america.  They weren't not doing it, they were claiming they couldn't do it for reasons.  We made up reasons for them (including WMD and trying to sell oil for euros) to go in and put in a new dictatorship who would develop and sell oil.  Everyone could care two god damns less if oil was sold for Eur (like e.g. Turkey and Norway do today)

You yourself again say that the smallest sub-unit needs to grow to price cheap purchases.  [You also said that satoshis can become too valuable in this deflationary currency](  This means to combat it, you add a new subunit because prices for things are getting cheaper (you could buy 10 candy bars for 1 satoshi, now it's only 1, then it's we need a new decimal point for candy bars).  MEANWHILE my BTC stash has NOT gotten cheaper (I had 100BTC, i still have 100 BTC as candy bars need a new decimal point).  I can now buy more good with my BTC stash (1 candy bar used to cost me .0000001, then it cost me .00000001, now it's costing me .000000001).  My BTC stash is going up in value because you are lowering the price of goods (remember you lowered the candy bar to a sub-satoshi because satoshi's are too valuable for cheap items).
So you are inflating your BTC supply by adding more decimal points, ergo 2.1\*10^17 &lt; 2.1\*10^18 &lt; 2.1\*10^19.  I think we are on the same page arguing about the same thing.  Thanks for helping me clarify.

You know who is paying for it?  The middle class tax payers who actually pay their taxes.  Just because the super elite and rich have accountants and the poor don't have bank accounts doesn't mean it's going into a null routed hole somewhere.  Don't try to act like *nobody is paying for it*.  Someone IS paying for it. 
With that said, who pays for healthcare, welfare and the like?  Also, who is paying for the loan that is sitting on my car right now?  I can tell you I am sure as hell paying for it.  I see it every month when I pay my bills and calculate my revenue and taxes.  But where does that money come from you are asking.  I can tell you I am sure as hell taking money from other people who are willing to pay for my services.  So it would appear that **I** am paying for these digital monies not backed by anything but the force of labour (or in other words, the faith of the us government which are the citizens of the united states but really translates to the middle class of the united states suckered into paying everyone's wars and free health) .

Because eventually the difficulty will grow to a point that your feeble node cannot compute.  As for your very first question, this is answered in most CS101 or CE101 courses.  You can only parallelize so far before misses in parallelization branch prediction are more costly than non-paralleled computation.  See Intel's P4 branching system for an example that was blazing fast when prediction worked and horribly slow when it missed.  See IBM's Cell (ps3 cpu) for example of less prediction for RAW I/O

fun fact: JPMorgan did not allow case-sensitive passwords until the recent summer 2015 update (this is why you were forced to change your password).  
funner fact: this breach was directly related to that weakness in their customer identity management system.
funniest fact: they were dinged by auditors on this but the expense to fix it was so great they were granted business justification exemptions several times
funneriest fact: the mitigation they provided to get the exemptions was a weak 2 factor auth implementation which sent auth codes over insecure mediums such as email AND allowed auth codes to be reused
scary fact: this type of neglect towards security is not limited to JPMorgan, but any bank, investment, healthcare, or bitcoin exchange could have ridiculous security policies behind the scene.  for instance, how many times have you gone to see a bankster, talked them up to get something from a 'back room' and said bankster leaves his or her computer fully unlocked.  or said banksters or bitcoin exchange (OKCoin comes to mind) have open power receptacles or network ports/cables sitting in plain sight allowing social engineering or other clandestine penetration attempts?
please do not look at this post with the mentally of 'HERR THIS IS WHY BITCOIN IS BETTER THAN BANKS', please look at it as companies as a whole need to better their security policies and massive penalties (% of your income, criminal penalties?) need to be put in place for those who cannot manage their own security.  if we do not do this then the flipside is a TSA for network security.  we do not want TSA for network security.  trust me.

As an early-adopter who has controlled a metric shitton of bitcoin before getting rid of most of them.  I would not equate users to transactions per day.

with all of the vitriol that's spreading through the community because of something as simple as the blocksize, it's easy for tensions to rise and sides to be taken.  who cares if i think the government shouldn't exist.  we live in a day where it does, so there's nothing anyone can say or do that will change any of that right now. so pay it no mind.  likewise, who cares if you think we need to revert back to the gold standard.  again, we're floating on fiat currency and all we can do is educate our friends and loved ones to be a least cognizant of escape routes when the house of cards comes falling.  maybe it won't, but if it does i want to be ready with at least 2MB blocks.  
but when you mute a **developer** on a *developer's mailing list* talking about that exact issue? you hurt all of us.  and for that reason alone, we should set aside differences and push for a common goal of seeing bitcoin as a viable currency and immutable ledger.  not a toxic community where arguments rage between neo-lebertarians and anarchistic-conservatives. not a community where you argue about someone smashing a phone.  seriously wtf/

so when i have to itemize all of my expenses you're telling me i can just hand my accountant the transaction IDs and say here you go, and head off to do more important work?  no.  they are going to call me and ask me who each transaction was with, the municipality where the transaction occured (you know... for sales tax), the category or nature of the sale (is this transaction an end user purchase in store, on the web, etc.).  this has nothing to do with old vs new paradigms, but very much based on laws which exist today.  when you can change the law that states we do not need to keep track of sales tax i will consider what you said, but until then the blockchain does jack shit in terms of accounting (unless you have some other vague proof that it will suffice)
and no bitcoin will not get there.  it cannot get there with a max clearinghouse of 3 transactions per second.  there is a reason why i am asking all you internet armchair 'experts' for advice, to see if you have any clue how the real world works (hint: you don't)

but you are changing the units of wealth!  1 BTC yesterday now = .1 BTC today and will = .01 BTC tomorrow.  
My 100BTC stash has not changed, *everything around me is now cheaper because I did not spend my money*.  Instead of buying 10 phones, I can now buy 100 phones.  But yesterday, the poor sod who bought 100 phones is now broke *and has no recourse*.  Now I can afford to buy 1000 phones.  But tomorrow I am broke and someone else can buy 10,000 phones.  How is that sustainable?  Replace phone with eggs or milk.
This whole discussion ignores if any other fiat currency still exists (eg the total value invested in bitcoin does not change).  Let's say the value can change.  Then you definitely *cannot* just move the decimal point.  Because now my $100 can buy 10x more BTC, meaning you are devaluing your BTC currency compared to any other currency.  Again, how is that sustainable?

No Linux could not, because the kerberos 5 libraries were incompatible with Microsoft's implementation of Kerberos 5.

Or numbers are in little endian format even though the protocol spec defines big endian.

Are you saying you would not like litecoin or dogecoin or any other cryptocurrency to be valid in California?  Ripple is the only other cryptocurrency which is being presented.  Assume the assembly are as dumb as their constituents.. would you like them to create laws that are worded very specifically to bitcoin and ignores enhancements (eg darkcoin, sidechains, etc).  Or would you like another cryptocurrency to show up and provide alternating views to enable more lenient regulations in the cryptocurrency field.  I, for one, would like to see competition come from silicon valley's inevitable cryptocurrency exchange. 
Futher, there was no "shilling".  They specifically described how ripple is different, how it is similar and then provided the exact same presentation that coinbase gave.  In other words, it is like Microsoft and IBM gave a meeting to discuss operating systems and Apple fan boys started whining about how MS and IBM both stole Apple's idea.

Correlation does not equal causation, but there is a strong association with the federal reserve managing the economic supply and technological and societal advances.  Suddenly we have a currency that can adapt with changes to the economy and our population soars.  Now we can allow "market forces" to remain the sole controller of the economy but we all saw how well that worked out between 1890 and 1930.

Leave the money there and lose 50k temporarily (that is stupid).  **OR**, sell your stocks so you have cash that will remain 90k as the stock devalues over 50%, then reinvest that 90k for shares at 50% off and my dollars will be worth 180k when the next bull market returns (that is smart).

also not imposing capital controls has a lot to do with the freefall of their currency as well.  notice each time BTC has fallen to crazy lows because of lack of capital controls.  conversely USD, EUR&lt; and other established currencies don't suffer from this problem (capital controls shut down markets during anomalous periods to ensure stability)

**yea but** we've never had a digital currency before.  remember, computers weren't created until the very end of last century.  so transitioning from physical token to a virtual token is a very difficult concept for many to grasp overnight.  in addition you still have societies coming online *who have never used a computer before*. this type of change will take at least a decade, but comparing it other large-scale changes, such as the metric system, it could take well over a century

Basically you will never expire your BTC stash because tomorrow 1 satoshi may buy 10 candy bars when today 1 satoshi will only buy 1.  I think we are on the same page so far.  So if I saved and waited for the cost of candy bars to go down (because value of BTC goes up).
Another decimal place is added since a satoshi is becoming more and more powerful as the BTC appreciates.  What i'm not exactly sure is what it is appreciating in comparison to?  USD? EUR? EGGS?
I understand the value of the candy bar does not change.  BTC's value goes up because I assume USD is going up?  Or will the BTC value go up because we are adding another decimal point?  What is the reference point to determine BTC value going up?


I don't think I can answer this,  I have no idea how a satoshi increases if there is a static number of bitcoins and it is the currency that is being used to determine value of fiat currency e.g USDBTC, EURBTC.  e.g. $1000 USD = 1BTC, 300₤ = 1 BTC and so on.  1 BTC =  1 BTC, so i'm not sure how that value changes...
This is why I have been asking how does the value of BTC change?  Back to my first paragraph: What i'm not exactly sure is what BTC is appreciating in comparison to.

if i want to send any money, i have to pay fees. which means i now have to keep a record of every fee i send with every transaction for tax and accounting purposes.  i do not need to keep transaction fee information for sales as the payment processor hands this to me.  this "hidden cost" is well worth the service compared to the  manual method of tying category, location, and other data to every transaction i make.
i don't think you have any experience with merchant sales, otherwise you would also realize that i don't pay any fees with credit card payments as well (it is deducted but we already know the cost and mark up prices accordingly so it's a wash at the end of the day -- how does one accomplish this with bitcoin?).

But it is not.  One is goverened by a group of people who are creating the protocol, clients, applications, and reference libraries and any one of those developers can introduce changes at any arbitrary moment (see the current ljr scandal).  The other is governed by a board of international users who have a mutual benefit to seeing protocols standardized (academic researchers, programmers, scientists, businesses, etc).  
For an example take a look at the 3g ridiculousness in the USA.  It did not follow the internationally recognized standard of what 3g is.  This lead to Americas playing catchup because 3g in USA wasn't real 3g.  To the point where its marketed at 3g but referenced as 2.5g.  That is not a major problem, we can figure that out (but it confused end users which cost carriers and handset makers real money).  But how about the K56Flex/v.92 debacle?  Or what about the pre 802.11ac wireless chipsets?  Consumers are stuck paying for chipsets which have to support various intricies because developers could not agree on a standard.
This is exactly what I see with BIP vs RFC.  BIP is perfectly fine for the precursor to an RFC, reference clients, or even layered applications.  But the RFC should be created to define the baseline standard for the bitcoin TCP protocol so you don't have issues like the negative client version number bug.  RFC would require that field to be completely defined, BIP appears to not be as strict.  You cannot have an interoperable protocol without adhereing to strict standards.
That is why RFC and BIP appear the same on the surface, but are completely different under the covers.  [Here is additional reading for your benefit.](

you are creating the 9th decimal place because you need to make items cheaper.  you can't get away with .00000001 anymore, now you need .000000001.  People need to afford that 9th decimal place, others do not need it and those that do not now have more spending money.  Remember you could not spend .000000001 before, but now you can.  Now those people with 10BTC can now afford even more items because 10/.000000001

how about just creating a coin with the same functions as a central bank.  i.e. no matter who mines, it goes into a central bank who pays a fee to the miners who mine.  central banks are responsible for funding any member bank.  member banks can be miners (but probably shouldn't be thanks to 2008).  central bank wallets need not be public on the ledger.  this enables government control of currency while keeping the blockchain which is arguably the best innovation of cryptocurrencies..

I don't think so.  We still need a Federal Reserve Bank.  We, the people, cannot be trusted to run scam free.  With that said, this is exactly why we have a government.  To enforce rules.  Things like citizen united allows corporate money to infiltrate the government and enforce their own rules.  Thus trying to take down the Federal Reserve will only serve to hurt us, the underbanked people (the unbanked have greater issues to worry about and mostly see the government as their savior).  We need to attack the problem at the root, corporate greed buying out our various government agencies.  We solve that by reversing silly rulings like Corporations have free speech rights.  Until we do that, we are doomed to corporations swinging their financial dick around on all of our half-completed solutions (eg. linux, openstack, bitcoin, etc).

Your solution is for the business owner to manually maintain prices for all products based on payment processor? Let's look at this for just a minute.
How much time will that take to continually manage this process?  Take x hours multiply by working days and multiply that by his hourly rate that he takes home.  Is that less than 1.74 or 2.9% of his yearly EDIT:~~revenue~~ profit (because he is using bitcoin to lower his costs and increase his bottom line)?  
Hint: it likely is not.  
Conclusion:  This is a more expensive solution.

I am intrigued to hear how the performance has improved 100x.  Are you claiming transactions per second as the performance metric which increased 100x?  If so I cannot recall when we were only able to reach 0.028 tx/s (since the hashrate [auto-adjusts to ensure consistent block times](  Or are you claiming hashrate as the performance metric, when hashrate only provides security which is not a performance metric (blockchain performance and security are inversely related, see etherium or doge as an example).
I am not trying to be a "concern troll" I am trying to keep the hopium out of serious topics such as this.  Performance of bitcoin is a very real issue that needs to be solved *if* we want bitcoin to function as a currency.  If we are moving the goal posts to just focus on the blockchain with bitcoins being used as a function of settlement network then performance as in tx/s is not an issue.

i cannot include e.g. my parents assets in my net worth even though they are on their deathbeds and their assets are all but guaranteed to pass on to me.  similarly i cannot include my entire car worth in my net worth since i have a loan of 30% of the value still open.  because if i needed to liquidate today, i would be unable to.

I understand the point you are making, I really do.  I just want to present to you a viewpoint from the opposite direction which I have had the joy of experiencing.  
In addition to being your own bank, you get to be your own insurance company if you ever lose your bitcoins.  I learned this the hard way and no longer taut "no maintenance fees" as a plus for bitcoin when (if you really look at the big picture) you are never truly getting rid of your bank account.  If anything bitcoin replaces the need for paypal and credit cards who don't charge maintenance fees to begin with.  The insufficient funds and overlimit fees are there as a service to you if you cannot manage your money.  When I could not manage my money I would blame the banks 'non sufficient funds' fee as my problem when the problem is that I only have $1200 in the bank account, that does not mean I get to spend $1500 even though that is available to me.   
Bitcoin helped me live within my means, having 3.4BTC meant I have 3.4BTC and nothing more.  Having to spend money on transaction fees AND conversion fees meant I would lose money just trying to buy coffee in the mornings.  I won't go into the time savings staying in USD would provide.  With that all said, bitcoin put me on the track of saving and learning the dark sides of investing.  In the end, I have a bank account again (it's also incredibly tough to get a bank account if you ever had a bank account close due to lack of funds), I have a credit card building my credit with my car.  I still keep bitcoin, but more for a lottery ticket for the moonshot ride.  
I will never use bitcoin to replace a bank ever again.

but the people who had the money to begin with have not changed how they deal with representative value.  100BTC yesterday = 100BTC today.  But 1BTC yesterday bought a dozen eggs, 0.1BTC today buys a dozen eggs.  Ergo, if I wait for the decimal point to move, I can now buy 10x the amount of eggs
I still have 100BTC remember, instead of having 99BTC after buying eggs I will have 99.99BTC instead.  Then in 5 days, after the next decimal point move, I will have 99.989BTC.  OK, lets assume the decimal point never moved and I purchased eggs 3 times.  Now I have 97BTC .

back in 1990-something i was in awe at the lawlessness of the internet.  freedom of speech was true back then and there were no worries about running unencrypted protocols.  however i couldn't stop thinking about how lawless the ma bell phone system was as recent as the early 1980s (anyone from the 60s-80s will remember how trivial it was to make free long distance and international calls).  that was ratched down very quickly as telecommunications scaled worldwide.  i wondered how the internet would follow that same process and we're witnessing it with NSA and other government intrusions into private communications.  obviously bitcoin will follow the same fate, as we are currently in the wildwild west of lawlessness right now but as popularity grows so does government interaction.  
there is zero chance a global currency will take hold without a fight between nations.  bitcoin as well is too slow for 7+ billion people to use, so it only makes sense that the government will jump in on the action.  anyone in this sub who says otherwise is looking for that million dollar bitcoin so they can be rich.  this will not happen for many reasons ( being bitcoin is not backed by anything and there is no way 1 bitcoin would be equal in value to my house which is physical and has real world uses)
but of course this sub is about bitcoin and diehard libertarians are the backbone of this sub's support, so what else do you expect.  i think your idea is a good one.

kinda like jp morgan when USD was linked to the gold standard.  jp morgan had so much money that he was able to bail out other banks *by himself* (see panic of 1907 for more information).  and that was back when they couldn't print it.  it got to the point that by 1920 jp morgan owned over 70% of banks.  he then helped form the federal reserve which allowed him (and his cronies) defacto control over the usd.
in an unrelated story, in 1929 banks at the time created massive financial debt in the form of creative but toxic vehicles.  so massive that it took a world war to jumpstart the economy.  a few years later congress ruled that such actions would be illegal, punishable by civil and criminal penalties.  fast forward 60 years, that law was removed.  less than 15 years later, the exact same toxic vehicles were recreated and caused a global recession.

If you have not "linked" bank accounts, you can use any email service, circle, western union, coinbase, paypal, etc to reach your original goal: to send money between bank accounts without paying to wire funds.  
Tada!  Sending money between bank accounts without paying to wire funds in the antiquated banking system that has been around for at least 10 years now.

A quantum computer alone will not "crack your key", that is not how quantum computing works.  It works by "collapsing" polynomal functions based on probability.  Your crypto function produces a possible billions of trillions of results right?  A quantum computer can fold that function down, based on inputs or outputs (or both) and reduce the possible outcome to hundreds of millions.  As you can see a quantum computer alone cannot figure out what the answer to the function is.  But with only hundreds of millions instead of millions of trillions, you can now brute force your entrance with conventional computing.  This is *overly* simplified, but the basic idea of how quantum computing can prime encryption for cracking.  There are limitations such as total qubits, quantum decay/noise, etc.  It should be assumed the NSA has access to a functional quantum computer, possibly google/dwave as well.  Maybe the russians or chinese.. but for the most part we are safe for the better part of the next decade.
How does the quantum computer collapse a function?  In very simple terms, its the same as how 1 is 1 and 2 is 2.  You don't need to ask how to define 1, it is a number and it has a value associated to it.  So when you see 1 + 1 you know there are near infinity answers but only one probable correct answer,  2.  This is the idea behind a quantum computer.  A great starting point is the quantum computing wikipedia page...

you could retire today with ~$2m and make $100k/year on interest.
if you are of the average age you will likely need $5m to retire when you are 70 to make the equivalent of $100k/year in todays dollars.  even though this retirement number keeps going up, it is entirely possible to reach this amount in your investments (trust me, i thought $2m was tough but i got there pretty quickly).  as every retired person has told me, 'the easiest way to make your first million is to save more than you spend'
bitcoin is very risky vehicle, as the saying goes 'don't put all of your eggs in one basket'.  but if you are looking for that monthly attempt to make the same run as bitcoin did from $0 to $1000+, check out after the bitcoin boom, i made a killing on WDAS, MELY, and LATF

I support the practical uses of bitcoin.  I do not support the impractical nature that this sub represents.  On one hand this sub thinks BTC is going to the moon.... With only 21 million btc.  There are 7 billion people on this planet.  Obviously we are enforcing status quo all over gain, except the bitcoin rich are different.  We still have the mark Cuban, Larry Ellison, warren buffet and bill gates of bitcoin.  This completely contradicts the libertarian movement that most bitcoiners subscribe to.  Okay so we can't get rid of classism with BTC, but at least its OPEN and FREE from corruption.  Except you have how many unknowns that hold the keys to thousands or hundreds of thousands of BTC.  BTC hits the moon and now we have the same intentions of using their money to influence others and governments.  Let's for now just ignore the legitimate uses of controlled inflation such as healthcare and welfare..
Okay that's the political side, let's look at the technical side.  BTC is a worldwide currency to enable billions including the unbanked.  Yet we can't agree on a consensus for block size and since we cannot, *we ban discussion on it in a public forum*.  1MB block sizes will really enable billions of unbanked, OK.  Then theres the whole decentralization problem.  We encourage everyone to control their private keys.. But then we require centralized ingress and egress points.  We encourage SPV clients because downloading the entire blockchsin a) takes too long and b) intimidates new users.  **the block chain will only get bigger**, meaning at some point we throw away old transactions (truncate) while relying on a select few (centralization).
Security.  We rely on a single nation for the security of the block chain.  No other nation competes with China in this regard.  But hey its okay because if they ever decide to close up shop *consensus* says we can fork and reset the hashrate... Just like we increased the block size.   Then there's the whole elephant in the room of energy consumption.  Never ending increase of energy consumption to record a gyft or purse purchase forever.  
This post ignores the fact that a centralized few own keys to the alert system!  And when any of this is pointed out?  Downvotes.  Because too many people are emotionally and financially invested.  Howmany subscribers have been buying bitcoin since they were 16, 18, or 20?  Took 401k loans to buy BTC.  Begged their parents to give them $5000 for a top of the line BFL miner they never received.  The people who were burned or lost their wallets and realized what it means to be your own bank....and insurance company.
No way too many issues with bitcoin as a currency.  Block chain technology is cool, but there are hundreds of alts that continue where BTC left off. Litecoin for fast confirmations, dash or monero for anonymity, etherium for robust smart contracts/drm.  ON TOP OF THIS, its all open source with like licenses friendly for companies wanting to utilize the block chain in private.  Just like Linux.just like open stack. Just like the internet.
What we are doing here is not important and entirely exists as an echo chamber.  Buttcoin at least starts these conversations before derailing into inane chatter about dingleberries.  A negative echo chamber if you will.  I sometimes thing the lesser known bitcoin sub's and all altcoin sub's are better avenues of communication .

And so does Coinbase.
In fact, the CEO of coinbase talked about using bitcoin in a manner that consumers do not see.  Essentially defining bitcoin as a behind the scenes payment system very much like 21.  Ripple CEO even says bitcoin and cryptocurrencies aren't meant to replace the dollar!  You can listen blindly or you can actually take an opinion of your own.
Read this again: both CEOs, Ripple and Coinbase are advocating for bitcoin to act as a payment processor but not so "you can be your own bank".  [Listen to this]( from 20 minutes.  That is the CEO of ripple speaking.  The next male person to speak is the CEO from coinbase.  This is entirely an argument for state recognition of cryptocurrencies, with Ripple being just one. 
I don't like Ripple, I don't like Paycoin, but I like Darkcoin and Potcoin.  I can't say dogecoin should not exist and then praise litecoin because one person doesn't like it.

also people like those in the articles also make a very hefty sum in a civil suit.  so do the lawyers at both sides. eric garner's family got $5.9 million(!!) for his wrongful death (this figure does not include the prosecutors and court costs). subtracting lawyer costs, it is the amount one needs to retire in 30 years.  the people who are truly fucked are the taxpayers who need to replenish the town's coffers.  problem is, people think because their presidential vote doesn't count then neither do their local votes.  but local votes are where your voice matters the most (and enough local voting in one direction swings regional votes which swings state votes which in turn directly affect national and, to an extent, international issues).  so, no one votes, and then they complain when their property taxes go up, education is cut, and (this one is common on reddit) police spending goes up.  
then you have the yuppies sipping lattes in their suburban who still think the colored people are bad and so they take these one off cases as okay because crime is low in their area.  any reduction in police spending could mean increased crime in their 80% white suburb.  can't let that happen.

have you seen lord of war?  it's pretty accurate.
it's the continuation of the cold war.  if we don't do it, russia will (see Syria).  the problem is we don't want syria to become powerful in the region because that violence will spill into our allies.  we also dont want ISIS becoming powerful AT ALL for the same reason.  so we have to fight them.  turns out it's a cluster fuck because turkey rebels also want to take out syria.  so now we have isis coming to power while the powers to take them out are fighting each other.  what's a US to do? 
also to note, part of the reason for the great depression is because we sat back and watched this type of fighting going on in europe.  we had no one to sell to because we weren't exporting munitions and no one wanted to buy from us because they were fighting each other.  once we got involved in WWII, we exported destruction.  everyone bought military gear AND we helped fund the rebuilding of europe.  and that is the sole reason why we were so economically rich in the 1940s and 1950s

I'm thinking of an idea like this but requiring the merchant to post something like a surety bond which is only used to manage the chargeback aspect of credit cards.  If you get a chargeback, the merchant is required to refund the money.  If the money is not refunded (bad merchant actor) then the funds are deducted from the bond.  The merchant is then required to replenish the bond, if they do not after a set period of time the merchant account is closed and the bond is forfeited.

Nope, 1913 was an example of what could happen to the US economy again if we just ignore it.  
Look further back to 1907 for what were the indicators of a major problem but political gridlock ignored.  There was such a massive run on banks that were over leveraged in a crashing economy that banks turned everywhere asking for loans!  The government had enough to cover the bank run, but only enough money to cover the bank run and then the US would be broke.  So instead they said no and used that money to prepare for public relief efforts. 
JP Morgan said NO to bailing out these banks, calling the banks despicable for acting in such a greedy manor.. even though he bailed out his cronie friends banks.  The majority of banks collapsed, dollars became prized possession and barter and trade became common until war.  It became apparent the banks cannot work in the interest of the people, so the Federal Reserve came into play.   
The problem is not with the federal reserve.  Its with the elected officials.  Corporate money (thanks Citizens United!) can influence politics, plain and simple.  Walmart and Bank of America has a hell of a lot louder voice ($$$) than you or I.  So they get their cronie friends in office who pass through lax tax laws while increasing income tax on us.

Yes, but that's like saying Malcolm X was a great political warrior that advanced the civil rights movements by his own actions. When Malcolm X was pushing for conflict and aggression.  Sure at the time that sounded like a position that could work, but looking at history we understand that Dr Kings silent and non-aggressive tactic worked many times over.  
During the periods of change is when you can make the greatest mistakes.  We really only lucked out for having Washington revolutionize the Americas, imagine if we had someone like Dick Cheney leading the call instead?

I don't want to replace a broken system with another broken system that would make us even more entrenched.  I would rather continue patching the broken system until the replacement system is ready.  3 days to transfer money?  i''m okay with that if it means I don't have to apply the Coinbase update to my wallet because all the major BTC holders are colluding to change the protocol in a manner that benefits them  


Why not.  We have proven smart contracts can work, so why can't we keep furthering bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to FIX these problems instead of saying "oh well it will just happen again, c'est la vie., but i got my BTC so all those other poor suckers are just that. poor"

Lawmakers should not be in the business of dictating how things like this go.  That is what a capital market is for.  When the capital markets begin abusing their power, governments step in.  With Bitcoin full control is given to the government (even if bitcoin goes against the government's interest, the government can then say bitcoin is no longer sanctioned, xyzcoin is)
Your postulation is great, but it does not match reality.  You should seriously consider taking some civic classes both on history and current day issues.  Some basic economics will also help straighten out your understanding.  I think you are describing some end state, but end states rarely if ever make it as they are described.  There will be too many entrenched interests against it which will force you to decide on a common ground.  Which is the visa gift card system.  Best of bank and cash worlds.

let's take our satoshi.  tomorrow my satoshi is worth 10% *MORE* because we needed to add a new decimal point to fund candy bars.  that is, the candy bar yesterday cost 0.00000001 and now it costs 0.000000001.  instead of going up in cost, it goes down in cost.  
in USD world what happens when the price of food goes up? you need more dollars to buy that food.  in BTC world, when the price of food goes up we add more decimal points.  *everyone* who has &gt;0 BTC now has additional money to spend.  EXCEPT, when we run out of additional money to spend, because we are saving, we create a new decimal point.  now your xbox is cheaper.  
how is this sustainable?  
isn't the problem we are trying to solve with bitcoin the exact reason why we do not want to arbitrarily expand the number of units?  ask yourself why we would want to subdivide and create smaller units if not to enrich those who actually hold BTC?
Remember, there is someone that will always hold more bitcoin than you, and they may have nefarious plans.
EDIT: you still don't get it.  you have 100 0.1g pieces of gold.  but what happens to the cost of everything else that is priced in gold.  eggs yesterday cost 1g of gold.  now they cost .1g of gold.  those that held 5g of gold can now buy 10x the amount of eggs than they could yesterday.  it doesn't matter what 10g of gold you have, the cost of eggs in gold has gone down making everyone that much more richer.  guess who benefits the most in this scenario?

no, because the central bank "blockchain" has an abstracted design that can be compared to bitcoin.  except it doesn't need millions of miners (just 12) because it is in the self-interest of those banks to ensure a robust central bank ledger (just as miners have a self-interest in preventing 51% attacks else they lose their revenue stream).  likewise, individual branches of banks have a self-interest in not colluding against itself as well.   on top of all of this, there are audits and criminal charges for those who break the regulation.

I'm still not following.. First of all how do cost of goods increase?  My guess is it is due to the increased costs for you to hire someone to produce the goods.  I would think that also means that at some point I would need to earn more money when I take a new job?  This would mean your $1 is always the same as my $1.
Second, if I were to ask you for $10, and you said okay here is $10 pay me back with 5% interest.  I would have to pay you back $10.50.  Where did those 50 cents come from?  Did the Federal Reserve create those 50 cents or did I?
I fully agree the federal reserve is creating additional loans at the expense of the us citizen, but the federal reserve does not have the power to act as an individual authority.  They are directly controlled by Congress which is clearly staffed by politicans that cannot manage their budgets.  In a way it sounds like you are attacking the federal reserve when the root of the issue are the politicans starting unpopular wars or forcing unpopular (TSA,ACA,NSA,CFAA,etc) laws, regulations, and additional government bodies on everyone.

USD doesn't deflate, ergo your example does not work.
Please reference your comment here for more information on *why* you need to divide that satoshi.  Because a satoshi grew in value and goods dropped in value (due to the very deflationary currency you mentioned).  So 1 satoshi was enough to buy 10 candy bars.  Suddenly DEFLATION! and your 1 satoshi can only buy 1 candy bar.  Suddenly DEFLATION AGAIN! and you need a new decimal point.  During this entire time, my BTC stash has not changed from 100BTC.  Now I originally bought 10 candy bars.  I'm at 99.99999999 BTC and 10 candy bars.  Decimal attack!  Now I buy another candy bar.  I'm at 99.99999998 BTC and 11 candy bars.  A wild decimal point moved! Now I buy another candy bar.  I'm at 99.999999979 BTC and 12 candy bars.  I will never exhaust my BTC supply because my candy bars keep getting cheaper everytime the decimal point moves.  Win-win-win!

why would you need the extra zeros?  that is my entire point that you are missing.


lets go back to 5th grade maths here.  ignore the decimal points what do you have? 2.1\*10^17.  You add a decimal point, you now have 2.1\*10^18 addressable units.  Add another point, you now have 2.1\*10^19 units.  How is that not inflating?

You're moving the decimal the wrong way.  You are taking 1 BTC and making it more divisible. e.g. 1.0000000BTC now you have 1.0000000**0**BTC.  If something yesterday cost  .0000001BTC and now it costs .00000001BTC then how many times do i have to subtract .0000001BTC from 1BTC until I reach 0.  how many times .00000001BTC until I reach 0.

You do not pick up a customers device and "demo" on it.  You just don't do that until you have a relationship of trust (yes she is a cousin, no that doesn't mean that she implicitly trusts him).  You see the part about how the cousin had reservations and then immediately deleted said application *because she did not know what that program did*.  Maybe she had all of her sexting pictures leaked once.  Maybe an ex tricked her to install spyware the same way.  The whole moral of the story is OP did not build trust with cousin.  Cousin, feeling strong-armed, whatever-ed her way out of it just to make sure the security of her phone was safe in her hands again.  This is the basic psychology behind sales and marketing 101.
There are many other things OP could have done as well.  First of all, demo the app in a nonthreatening way i.e. on his own devices.  Then start using kino to increase rapport.  E.g. put arm around shoulder and in a soothing voice say something like "come on, let me demonstrate how this works in the real world.  it's free money, do you like free money?  [yes] you can use this same virtual money to buy things at (insert something cousin likes) using gyft or purse.io.  do you ever do shopping online? [yes] then you would LOVE this app.  may i have your phone, I will install the app for you and show you how to get started [more willing to say okay]" demonstrate by handing cousin *your phone*.  then you, not letting her phone out of your control until the demo is over, you say "tada!" and show her the transaction.  Immediately you send the funds back minus some free getting started coin.  Hand her back the phone only after the first confirmation. I guarantee that is a sale and next time op sees cousin she would have more bitcoin.
Come on, sales is just as easy as getting laid.

first of all, i find it a bit funny that you can respond to everything else but you can't reply to this question:




No that is not what the judicial process is supposed to do, that is what *you would like it do*. What you want and what happens in reality are two different things.  Trying to change that will be akin to trying to change the stand your ground law.  It makes sense to a majority (you are in the minority, sir) and so majority rules in a democratic environment.  You are mistaken about what the judicial process is supposed to do, I strong recommend you go back to civics 101 or sit through a few (not small claims) court cases.


no they are upholding an existing law.  it was not a case of the law is worded very broadly nor a case of straight up rights violations and they need the judicial branch to fix the problem the legislative branch refuses to.  however if the law is worded correctly and the interpretation matches the law, then the "case law" you describe is actually jut the law being upheld.  case law dictates what parts of the law does not mesh with reality and is overruled by the courts.


If you murder someone you should go to jail.  If you do not pay someone $5000 you should not go to jail.  Can't get any clearer than that.


I said $16m in extensive damages to e.g. the courts, to government offices, to things that are not easily resolved by the same courts that you believe are doing things the wrong way.  If you claim to be a hairdresser and then use turpentine in my hair who's liable the hair dresser or the company who mispackages the product?  what if you bought the product from china?  is the minimum wage mom going to be able to take time off work, hire a lawyer to find peers of experts and then expect to be compensated when the hair dresser barely has $10k in the bank account?  this is why there are licenses for things such as food, and hair dressing, so if you permanently disfigure someone you can't just say 'oops didn't know that would happen', filing bankruptcy and disappearing.  no, you have to post a bond, you do a background check, etc.  because sometime in the past this was a problem.
but then again you probably are okay with removing old laws (like glass-steagall) to recreate the same problems that have happened in the past (the 2008 financial crisis happened in 1907 and 1913 as well, glass-steagall was created to prevent the 2008 crisis.  we removed that law and guess what happened in 2008... a crisis)

Seriously though, I'm hodling Ford stock because I bought it at $5/share.  Hodling Netflix from $40/share.  Bitcoin is great for those investors who have under $30k to play with and can't afford a margin account.  Once you have a real investment account with over $50k, you can play options, shorts, longs, etc. all day on way more stable commodities or businesses.

All 4xx responses are fatal in that they are errors and require the client to retry.  401, for example, is an error that the user does not see, but if you watch the wire on any sites which require authentication you will see that most clients will connect twice.  Once without authentication and once with.  You do not want to automatically send auth credentials because you do not know the location is forbidden until the server tells you (and you don't want to leak auth data).   Also, most http server implementations will also drop keep-alive sessions for 4xx responses.

Isn't it?  Take the definition of a check and you'll see that bitcoin fits the bill perfectly.   It presents a method to transfer funds with later confirmation.  Accepting 0 confirmation funds is the same as accepting checks, you have no idea if they are going to bounce (double spend) or not.  That first confirmation is akin to their bank saying yes the funds are valid.  Except we don't need to rely on banks, we can do this between any two parties in a trustless decentralized nature.
This is no different than a check, except there are a finite number of these "glorified checks" and so we can attribute a value to these checks.  That is where bitcoin as a commodity rises.  However the utility of bitcoin is very low, i.e. it can only manage 7tps, 1MB block limit, privacy issues with users who reuse addresses, etc which doesn't make it much better than a check (compare to Visa which can handle millions of transactions per day, fraud insurance, escrow services, etc)

using joe shopowner's example, yes it does.  you go from 2.1\*10^17 to 2.1\*10^18.  that is an increase in the total number of *usable* bitcoin.  now someone who was holding 100BTC can now spend .000000001 BTC instead of .00000001 BTC and can now afford to buy those cheap items because he saved and waited for his deflationary currency to spawn a new decimal point.  more importantly, joe shop owner is only getting .000000001 BTC instead of .00000001 BTC and that doesn't mean the price of eggs has followed the same decimal movement.

Effects have causes; effects can, and usually do, become causes of another effect(s); and there can be a large number of cause and effect "chains" created based on a single causal event. Thus Cause1 yields Effect1; Effect1 becomes Cause2, which yields Effect2 (second order effect); and Effect2 becomes Cause3, which yields Effect3 (third order effect).
However something tells me you do not wish to rationally discuss the additional causes that would occur as one currency goes down (simply because you are expecting others to do the work of explaining what possible second and third order effects from your ridiculous scenario are)

To OPs point.  You can just send them a strongly worded letter that you will be taking them to small claims court to resolve the issue (the bank who double charged).  If they do not act, you go to small claims court on the way home from work and you file suit against the bank which double charged.  Now you wait for someone from the bank to contact you and resolve the issue.  Just because you are one person out of thousands with an issue doesn't mean the bank is inefficient.

If the old fork hashrate stagnates due to a high difficulty and bad actors move in to start attacking the old fork, wouldn't that be an incentive to move to the new fork?  Let's move on to the next topic of no revenue.  Miners on the old network would be faced with no revenue either.  How would they know they went full retard when the computing power, the power which secures the blockchain, is now on new fork.  Why would the miners lose this battle, they are the ones with the hashrate.  If 65% of the hashrate left today, you think 35% can complete blocks in a timely manner that won't affect the network?


I never said for no reason. Here is a reason: they want to use a fork of bitcoin where the halving never happens so they keep their revenue stream. Also, I have never once mentioned a miner as a single entity.  I will [quote my original text]( please point out where I talk like miners are a single entity:


Are you telling me that a majority of miners cannot act in unison for a common goal? Are we forgettign what happened with ghash.io last year?


That is what I was hypothesising this entire time, thank you for finally addressing my concern.  It won't be in stalemate forever, I said this. The stalement will end when the difficulty lowers to compensate for the lower hashrate.. but for the network to move on with a lowered hashrate..  What is stopping someone from the new fork to attack this code-fixed old fork since the hashrate is much lower?

you cannot break up the SHA256 computation, calculating a hash is very serial.  you can create a hash in parallel with another hash, there is nothing new here: SMP in the 90s brought up serious conversation of breaking DES due to effectively halving the time to find a collision.  laughable at the time, hilariously trivial in hindsight)  but you cannot just throw cores onto silicon and call it a day, you have a very great chance of introducing defects so you need to minimize transistor size.  so you cannot apply moore's law to hash velocity.
again same example as above, you create a new chip that can crunch more operations per second.  this decreases each hash time.  you can throw many cores and crunch more hashes at one time, but you may have to slow down ops (underclock your silicon) to avoid production defects.  so moore's law is still increasing transistor count but limitions such as e.g. cost prevent you from increasing hash speed in a uniformly linear manner
@_date: 2015-03-10 14:18:58
You are saying no revenue as if that will last forever.
The old network will be at a stalemate for weeks/months/years(??) because all of the hashing power left.   Which is of greater value in the long term, less revenue or current revenue minus one month's revenue.  All the miners would need to do is collude to leave the new fork leaving hashrate at an all time low.  No new blocks or transactions will be solved due to the difficulty being so high and being weeks or months away from an adjustment.  To ensure people don't just wait out the storm, miners can actively attack the old fork so new fork becomes defacto fork.  Now the new fork has revenue and the old fork at it's new, lower difficulty will be controlled by evil parties wanting you to switch to the new fork.
To amend your statement, the miners on the new fork will be faced with no revenue, *temporarily*.

Exactly if you believe bitcoin is going to succeed you invest.  This has proven to work for Amazon, Apple, Tesla, Redhat and Canonical, Linux and the various BSDs, and Openstack and Docker.  Bitcoin is going to succeed in its goal to replace banks and replace the need for expensive payment processors.  Eventually this will pave way for adoption as a currency where merchants do not have to worry about chargebacks, an enforceable counterfiet-proof blockchain to prevent hidden taxes, and the ability to push payments rather than give out my personal information to anyone who wants it.  That's a 100% chance of your hypothetical 1000x return.  $7,000,000 sounds nice to me.  
But that's exactly my point.  This Roger Ver person has the possibility of 1000x return on $90,000,000.  Even though I will be able to retire without worry, the fact that this sole person would now have $90,000,000,000 is a bit worrying.  What kind of leverage can someone with that amount of money do.  Lobby for laws or regulations in their favor?  Start a bogeyman campaign about anti-vaccination or pro-choice?  Hire programmers to overrun development of bitcoin itself and direct forks to features that benefit only him.  All of that has a direct impact on the $7 million i'm retiring with.

I know why they charge the 5 cents, it's to cut  back on waste and decrease our use of oil/plastic bags, but it's just annoying.  You know what else is annoying?  The fact that we're still using plastic credit cards, think about the waste that creates.  Anyway, you really pay attention to those fees no matter what you make... Is my income not a common income?  I feel like everyone around me needs to maintain that income in order to support their lifestyle.  They have boats, two trucks, some have sports cars, they all hire people to take care of their landscaping, and they run and bike around wearing fancy workout clothings.  My house isn't cheap, do they all buy their houses cash?  I can't imagine that, I would think they all have a mortgage of some sort.  But $500k?  That's like $5k/mo.  Who spends that on a mortgage?
I feel like I make nothing compared to them.  But the excess I am not wasting on boat insurance and the like, I am buying bitcoin during down sessions.  I am certain we're going to see $10k before 2017 as mass adoption picks up so I'm just hodling silently.

Some people just see technology better than others and know when to invest early.  Everyone who got into bitcoin in the first 3 years became rich.  We are currently in wave 2 where people are just now hearing about bitcoin.  Those early adopters will be rich.  Then when people realize the power of bitcoin, we will begin wave 3.  Anyone who invests after wave 3 will be chasing and will ultimately be the new 99%.  This is why it is important to keep our focus on the end game of bitcoin: a global currency that ends financial corruption on an almost near global scale.  Don't ignore what is happening, we are on the cusp of an extraordinary wealth transfer that will dwarf what we saw in 2008

Billions in fines were paid because they agreed to accept TARP.  TARP made them liable for monetary punishment.  See BOA, Chase, et al all paying huge fines because they accepted TARP and were found to have deceptive trade practicies. Do you even read regulatory acts? BOA bought Countrywide who was the evil company that was doing the fraud that you said.  BOA found out about this fraud AFTER they bought countrywide.  They fixed the fraud.  TARP still says BOA is liable for fines because it's under their umbrella now. Want to talk injustice?  THAT is injustice.  BOA did nothing wrong, bought a company they thought was doing well, and turned out had massive fraud *which they put an end to*. Still paid fines. LOL

only if government regulations do not specifically forbid it.  remember we once forbade investment companies with exotic financial instruments to intermingle with our banking system.  we saw this happen constantly from 1917 through 1933 so we created the glass-steagall act to limit said actions.  so banks could not provide a mortgage-fiat interchange service.  but then we repealed glass-steagall and we allow it.  this DID NOT create any problems in 2008 and the frank-dodd act has *NOTHING* to do with glass-steagall.  oh wait yes it does, it's putting regulations back in place to limit specific XXX-fiat interchange services.  bitcoin is both allowed and caught in the mess.  we probably don't want banks messing with crypto yet (or maybe we do so we can get the damage out of the way early?)

Wow.  
So the "3g worldwide kindle service" is actually just a sim card that is allowed on select cell networks.  You see Amazon, being an international company, made deals with every provider.  If your provider supports this sim card, it will always work.  Beyond this support, if you have a data plan on an unsupported network then you can also connect to the same kindle network.  
It works because the provider allows a specific configuration such as dns lookup to a specific dns server which only returns a single set of ip addresses which are Amazon loadbalancers.  The loadbalancers are technically proxies, but definitely not defined as one per [RFC 2068](  Now what about when the Kindle is on a network with a data plan.  Unless those loadbalancers (what you call proxies) are unreachable (great wall of china, network firewalls, etc) you will always be able to connect to the kindle service.  This is how your Kindle amazingly works on your wifi too.
So yea, 2Mbit is entirely possible in some parts of the world which will see speeds of ~300KB/s.  Shades of grey would download in 4 seconds.  But when you get to middle of the sahara, ubekustan and only connect at 170kbit/s, you can still get Shades of Grey to download.  You just set up camp at an oasis for 10 minutes then continue on your way.
 
So entirely what the poster was hoping for.  Bitcoin-based worldwide data on a 3g kindle.  I'd buy it

not to mention file sharing only took off because there was no viable alternative.  everyone had to buy a song that worked with a specific device or service.  file sharing of mp3s allowed people to get the same music regardless of device.  enter spotify, youtube, pandora, which all work regardless of your device.  enter amazon mp3 and DRM-free itunes.  Now piratebay no longer has music in their top 100 pirated files.  (for those of you shaking your head ready to jump to the reply button.. Read that again: fixing the flaws of the bad implementation removed the need for a crowd-sourced workaround).
if you use file sharing as an example, it may be safe to say bitcoin could make banks and payment processors fix their problem (like eg apple pay).. but the bottom line is bitcoin will not replace banks (where am i going to go for a loan or mortgage again?) and payment processors (eg paypal is replaced with bitpay.  but you are not exposed to anything about bitcoin, eg. accept bitcoin! get paid in usd!)

Then why isn't it being used today, genius?  And I mean right now.  
Dell accepts bitcoin for consumer payments from their website.  Can you call dell and request a bitcoin address for paymetn?  Didn't think so.  When the government or large corporations make a purchase order, do you think dell says please remit in bitcoin.  I can tell you that my Dell rep makes zero mention of bitcoin when I purchase servers from him.  Shall I call him right now and ask him how I can send payment for my next purchase in bitcoin?
To your other example, So you hire one engineer and you integrate bitcoin.  When shit breaks you're going to rely on that one engineer?  Or will you need to hire several and a support team?  That support team needs to be managed, so there's additional work and resources required.  FedEx, UPS and other shipping companies are global so you need several engineers in several locations, same with support personal (since you know that affiliate in Ethopia has no idea what a bitcoin is and will need to walk through the process).  Then there's regulatory.  Bitcoin in the US is not treated the same as Bitcoin in Russia or Bangladesh.  So you have to hire lawyers to review all of the global laws and stay up to date.  You need to hire regulatory staff to ensure risk compliance (marketing is sending emails to Bangladesh? that can get an employee arrested!)
The problems I am describing require serious consideration, and why bitcoin simply doesn't exist in practice outside of minute use cases in a few countries.
EDIT: food for thought.  It cost $2.5 million for a well known financial institute to implement OpenStack in their organization and replace VMWare.  Openstack is open source and trivial, anyone can set it up!  But it cost $2.5 million in human resources to get it designed, integrated with the company, and provide a transition for business units from the legacy platform.  That's a real cost that I bet doesn't talk about when they push the benefits of Openstack.

dude, i have done substantial work in IT.  IT alone is creeping up the charts to become the major consumer of energy, and not in a good way.  the green energy standard, of which i am on the council, started over 3 decades ago to try to combat the waste of energy since it grows exponentially as technology is adopted (go look up numbers on the wasted energy from powered-off playstation 3's, you should be shocked).  we have made great strides but we still need to be aware of the damage it causes to the planet.  bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, while a very novel and groundbreaking technology, needs to address energy growth early on.  to say it's a moot point, is to say that a tesla is not a valid investment.  of course a tesla is a good investment, *if it results in a net reduction of carbon usage*.  if you drive your diesel car .5 miles a day, switching to a tesla will actually increase your carbon footprint.  so why not switch to a bicycle instead?  if your primary mode of transportation is a motorcycle (for any distance), a tesla will result in lowered carbon footprint.  problem is it would cost more and people see $$ over their carbon footprint.  same with flying, you cannot practically take a boat to hawaii from california, or transport by rail, you cannot practically take a train from NYC to LA. 
enter bitcoin.  other cryptos like e.g. litecoin offers a much lower carbon footprint with most of the same benefits of btc.  ergo, bitcoin's carbon footprint is ridiculous for something like purse.io or gyft, but is a net benefit for settling stock trades or asset purchases compared to a bank.  
so in conclusion it has zero to do with cost (although that is what everyone focuses on) and everything to do with carbon footprint.  and the carbon footprint of a typical bitcoin miner or node is ridiculously high and wasteful for the current purpose.  however if we want to talk about costs, the economics of rising costs of energy production will quickly prove that bitcoin as a currency is not viable.  think of bitcoin as the arpanet (cool tech but woefully inefficient) compared to the internet.

email was a fad being used on college campuses that was a step above the 'talk' program (the precursor to irc) but completely useless until AOL and compuserve decided to enable internet email.   did more to email than anything else and that was because aol had some 10 million users.  other isps HAD to use email to communicate with the walled garden that is AOL.  just to point out, today instant message is the preferred method of communication (see twitter, facebook, whatsapp, groupme, snapchat, etc) and most see email is the annoying spam-ridden technology of the 90s
credit cards were created by bank of america.  everyone and their mom wanted on as soon as it came out (seriously look up the history of credit cards).  it was visa that took over the "Credit card" business from bank of america.  mastercard spawned from a similiar takeover.
Let's ELI5 now.  bitcoin, the purpose of this sub, is a specification of bits that describe how applications can talk to each other.  no wait, bitcoin is a money that can be taken with you and transferred to others.  no wait, bitcoin can be used to move the value of dollars and euros and other things that cost money (ex one bitcoin for 2 dollars).  linux is a set of software functions that manages the computer you use today.  no wait, linux is just the control mechanism of the computer you use today.  no wait, linux is the entire desktop of the computer you use today.  the comparison between linux and bitcoin are much like many popular open source software today except if you look at popular open source software it does not need a lot of fan fairing or explaination for adoption.  
email came every easy since AOL prepared everyone (all you have to do is add  at the end of your username).  mac os x came very easy since they had money to make their operating system more useful and supported on other hardware platforms.  credit cards came very easy because people didn't need to worry about bringing together money at the very time of payment.  these are all examples of how world changing technologies do not require door-to-door evangelical support like bitcoin.

They will see nothing wrong with this, as they have done this all their life and it's not a hassle to give up privacy for convenience.  You are saying something else will do something about it.  That to me means you are proposing we do nothing about it because I can also see something else doing something.  And that's making cash illegal and requiring payment methods which inherently minimize your privacy (such as bitcoin).  Which is entirely plausible if we just sit around awaiting this antifragile replacement system.

I wholeheartedly agree.  I agree politicians need money to do *everything*.  How are they paying for universal healthcare?  With increased taxes on us.  How are they paying for the war against terror?  With increased spending.  I agree with this argument.  I do not understand how the tax is silent and inflation is hidden.   Congress creates bills every year that says "We need to do this this and this, we will accomplish it by borrowing against this and this".  Sometimes this causes problems and we stall raising that credit limit (debt ceiling).  But just because we, the people, stick our head in the sand doesn't mean it's hidden. 
This seems, to me, to not be a problem with the monetary supply but a problem with the people in charge of running the country.  Why are we borrowing so much?  Why are we passing bills which funds increased taxes and increased borrowing?   Why are we not doing anything to curb their behavior?  
It really sounds like you are saying whenever we create a loan we are creating inflation.  Which is exactly what I thought a loan does.  What I am missing from your argument is what is the downside to the inflation?  Today I cannot buy a milk for $1, but I can still afford to buy milk for $3.  If my grandparents were to teleport to today with their money they would not be able to afford milk.  If I teleported back to their time I would be able to buy a lot of milk.  The issue is, today's $1 is still the same value today.  Tomorrow will be the same, just as yesterday's was the same.  Is there an inherent problem to this system?  I am still able to buy milk just as my grandparents could and my grandchildren will.  What would resolve this, stopping the creation of loans?

actually it was kuwait.  and it was a cargo plane, someone didn't strap down some cargo and it got loose on take off.  in kuwait you need to take a pretty steep angle of attack away from airports because, you know.. rpgs.  watch the torque of the plane in the video.  once you have loose cargo, you're doomed :(  
anyway the cargo put the plane into a flat spin, the pilot tried to counter by nosing up but was not nearly high enough to perform that maneuver safely.. as you can see the plane stalling and nosing into the ground (another 5000ft and he would have survived)

So the answer to your question is yes.
Bitcoin is not a protocol because it does not have an RFC ergo there is no standard and can change at the whim of a few developers.  That is not what creates interoperability.  Either the devs don't care and are willing to sink a ship by not formally standardizing a protocol or they are pulling the biggest ponzi scheme off known to man.  Everyone on the original board of the foundation has some connection to lost, stolen, or laundered funds.  That makes me continue to think ponzi

If you are getting your mail stuck in spam filters, there is something spammy about your host (likely you have a poor reputation due to misconfigured mailservers).  In all of my consultations I have had with clients with mail delivery woes, I have always found things like lack of DKIM/SPF, open relays, mail servers with open http proxies or vpns.  Security services give you negative points, and then sell their reputation systems to real companies.  Sometimes its not possible for your home server to separate the vpn from the mta, luckily cloud computing is cheap and you can have a hosted service manage that for you for bits a day.
It's like the postal service, it costs you money to send mail but you can receive mail all day.

It doesn't necessarily need to.  If I take a new job that raises my income 10%, I have beat  inflation for at least 4 years.  Beyond that I would need a raise or I could use my advance on inflation to further mitigate the loss of inflation for a few additional years.  Now if I am able to take a job which raises my income beyond inflation for the duration of my life, I am okay because even though I have more dollars today, I can put them to work and they cumulative amount will still be worth the same tomorrow.  This is generally your retirement number.  If I make $2m today, I can stop working for the next 60 years.  That is not realistic, I need to 
How does the economy benefit from me taking money out of circulation and holding it?  Rather if I gave the money to a company or used it myself to start a company, my money could work for me and continue to match inflation.  This has the benefit of providing liquidity to the market and allows my net wealth to keep up with inflation.  I don't understand how investing in us is risky.  Real estate alone is not risky.  Nor is the stock market.  There are risky investments in every industry
* subprime loans are inherently risky, but AAA loans are not
* pennystocks are risky, but blue chips like AT&amp;T, GE, and CSX are not
* NXT is risky, but bitcoin not as much


why don't we print money backed by assets anymore? what was the government's reasoning?  what happened that said hey we should not do this anymore.  I can't imagine they just took a system and changed it overnight without consulting anyone.  An example, solar panels.  They did not all of a sudden become popular overnight.  The rising costs of oil and climate changes were real problems which drove the development of solar panels.  Now solar panels can compete with fossil fuels to the point that a change will occur.  In 100 years I would hope we don't just say "we used to use fossil fuels and it was great but then solar and now it's bad. we need to go back to fossil fuels"...

My point is that your initial reason for having both is a very very flawed argument.  I don't think your statement of having both is invalid.  Just that "damn that recurring payment got me again!!" is a very low priority to users.  They would rather have the conveniences of plastic and occasionally deal with a bill they forgot to cancel than to have none at all.
As for having both.. doesn't paypal already do exactly what you describe?  Push transactions to providers?  And funny enough, they also support pulling transactions and provide all of the benefits of plastic (subscriptions, chargeback, etc).  One could say paypal is the killer app that already exists.  You could argue that paypal is not distributed in the sense that regular schmoes like you or me run the confirmation network, but the question is do we really need it if 99.999% of the population is content with it?
Look at this, chip+pin technology on credit cards have been used in the eurozone for the better part of the last decade to now.  Americans are still happy with their 16+4 credit cards.  It took Target, Home Depot, etc getting hacked for consumers to realize hey this causes my coffee to cost 10 cents more and start asking what's going to fix it.  Now we're getting chip+pin.  How would consumers see the savings from going to bitcoin?  Remember we are in a capitalistic society.  No company deflates prices unless it's to get a stranglehold on the market.  Example: look at airlines.  oil prices tanked, they have locked in prices of $50/barrel for the next 1-3 years.  Do you think we will see ticket prices dropping 20-30%?  HA HA no, because they can pocket the difference as profit.  You can see this by the skyrocketing value of every airline company.

You don't need to use paypal.  There is Western Union, square cash, interact, google, wells fargo, jpmorgan, bank of america, xoom, webcrawler, tipalti, wow, popmoney, kotak  (this is all i found from two pages of a google search)... which all have the ability to send money via email.  Who is forcing you to use paypal, it sounds like the customer had the option to and decided to use paypal and the business owner accepted it.  OP could have rejected paypal funds and demanded BTC, but instead he blames it on Paypal instead of his client ignoring his payment demands.
How is that different from someone walking up to a store owner and saying do you accept BTC? "well not usually, but i will take it since you dont' have any other money..." and then store owner can't get said BTC funds converted back to USD?

Microsoft and Dell only accept BTC for their consumer division.  They could kill off their consumer products and it wouldn't be a drop in the bucket for them.  Their bread and butter comes from business contracts which are not paid for in BTC for several reasons.  (btw I called my Dell rep, they do not accept BTC for business accounts and he has no reason to assume that will change in the near future).  Overstock moves less than 1/10th of their yearly revenue in BTC.  So the few companies off the top of your head barely make a dent in the larger ocean of the economy.


If fedex stopped allowing chargebacks, I would stop doing business with them.  So would a lot of other people since you the shiper would have to go to court to get your money back in the event they fuck up your shipment.  At least today you can charge back if you use a CC (or not pay until the issue is resolved if you are on a purchase order.. do you even know what a PO is?).


There is zero cash being handled in the scenario I am discussing.  Eg microsoft shipping xboxs to walmart.  Dell shipping me servers.  Me shipping a product internationally.


Do you understand how large Fedex is?  Go google their *quarterly* revenue.  They can dictate their fees to any payment processor.  I'm pretty sure their fees are cheaper than the entirety of switching to btc AND staying with it for a 15 year period.


My bank account in Brussels is with the same bank that we bank with in LA.  I can transfer money between accounts with a few clicks of my mouse and pay zero fees.  Read that again: no fees on the transfer.


Like shipping products internationally? Oh hay they do that already!  So lets just rip out this fully functioning system for one that has never been stress tested and will likely cause additional costs.
Everything else you have pointed out is already done that way today.  The only middleman involved in paying our employees is the timekeeping my employees must do themselves.  They work 40 hours a week, they enter that in their timesheet.  Every other friday my system sends the hours to ADP. ADP calculates all of the taxes and deductions and direct deposits or mails a check to my employee.  I don't have to figure out what state they live in and do tax math, I don't have to figure out who is international and who is domestic.  ADP does that all for me.  I have already reduced my HR overhead and banking fees by siwtching to them from Bank of america.  At the same time ADP provides an API where I can fetch my finance data from them which is integrated into my ERP. Finance just verifies the numbers are correct and they go about their day.  
*how does a mature bitcoin make this any more efficient?*  will bitcoin tell me what the state county and local taxes are required to be paid? 
* **NO**.  
will bitcoin provide integration options for my ERP or will I have to develop that myself? 
* **DEVELOP YOURSELF OR HIRE A THIRD PARTY**.

would you really?  what if banks offered 3 hour ACH transfers?  that would essentially be the same thing wouldn't it?  you ACH money to bitcoin and you're in BTC.  you spend money on your debit card you withdraw BTC and ACH USD back to your bank account.
or a better question: if coinbase did this and then bank of america, chase, and BB&amp;T all offered 1hr ACH transfer, what would that do to the adoptability of bitcoin?
remember, [bigger companies]( have [gone out of business]( to [prexisiting competition]( for less. i don't care what you say, when SPRINT a fucking cell phone company can buy an electronics chain, it really makes me wonder what a company the size of banks can do to coinbase.  remember everything has a purchase price.
TL;DR: my point is banks will likely adopt the pros of bitcoin and leave behind the cons leaving companies like coinbase in the dust

Oh really.


In 16 year old terms, it means banks cannot be intertwined with real estate if the real estate is packed into an investment vechicle.  Or in other words, banks cannot be involved with selling the mortgage if they are also selling the same investment.  But no, we said "hey lets remove that law **since it's 60 years old and not relevant anymore LOL"**.  So we did.  Then banks said "hey wait, there are no laws that prevent us from selling this mortgage and then packing the same mortgage into an investment package and selling to investors!"  So they did.  Then they said "hey wait there are no laws to sell bad mortgages to foreign investors". So they did.  So yea the entire 2008 crash could have been avoided with Glass-Steagall still in place.
Dodd-Frank took it a step further and put limits so banks are no longer to big to fail.  The bonus of this regulation?  Banks have to revamp their IT systems to be able to branch off or acquire new entities on demand. Which ultimately paves the way for technologies like Bitcoin and others to be implemented in banks and commercial entities.

I got so rich off QE.  everyone was bitching about how horrible it was going to be.  I asked, why is it so horrible?  They said because it's going to be funneled into the pockets of the people who caused the problem.  So I investigated, and they were partly true.  QE was used to back MBS assets.  A lot of those assets are tied up in the stock market, ergo QE wasn't being funneled into the banks it was funneled into the stock market.  Anyone with half a brain could put two and two together: invest into the stock market, withdraw after the rise from QE.  
So I bought banks heavily tied to MBS (citigroup, bank of america, etc) and then also consumer based stocks (comcast, verizon, at&amp;t, walmart, sephoria, lululemon etc).  Along with aggressive ETFs ([powershares woohoo]( gave me an average growth of 45% each year for the past 4 years.

Bro, do you even understand how laws work in America?  There are 3 branchs of government who can control laws.  Its more than "one person passing laws without needing congress".  It's one person passing laws for the executive branch which the FCC falls under.  Congress (the legislative branch) can step in and say whoa let's pass this bill to remove those FCC laws.  Then we can live happily like that.  Sometimes it doesn't work that nicely and we get into a spat.  That spat goes through our judicial system via our courts and eventually makes it to the supreme court. Our judicial branch is the 3rd party that breaks the tiebreaker.  
So how the *fuck* are we a dictatorship if we have 3 distinct branches of government which all can make binding laws?  Maybe the real answer is the politicians you vote (or don't vote) for don't give a shit and just pomp and circumstance to appear like they are doing their job.  Every issue that has can be resolved by changing the politicians in office. But instead of trying to actually go out and vote, they whine on reddit about the blockchain... which can be attacked by any of the 3 branches of government.  And when that does happen we whine DICTATORSHIP.  Yet when we point out the same thing happens for eg Glass-Steagall Act all we hear are crickets.

You can't even find a common ground that would appeal to me as much as it would to you.  You refuse to even make that attempt.  What is the point of further conversation when someone is so blind they cannot even consider their neighbor.
You have just stated that your viewpoint is the only way forward.  You previously stated that bitcoin is the way forward.  You likely have money tied up in bitcoin so you have an incentive to see bitcoin succeed.  It is safe to say if bitcoin succeeds you will become more wealthy and thus more powerful.  This leads to the end game that you will have the ability to dictate your views upon others.  You see bitcoin as a way to force your viewpoints on others, as you think others with money force their viewpoints on you. 
You have no hope.  When there is no hope, there is only doom.  You are dooming yourself to failure which will only lead to further aggression, distrust, and deceit.  Until you step back and realize that for others to be willing to accept your viewpoints, you need to consider, understand, and be willing to accept contrary viewpoints.  
But i'm sure these words are not going to matter, you just see the keywords such as bitcoin, aggression, and your viewpoint and will likely respond with assumed notions.  I wish you the best of luck when you finally realize you cannot force your viewpoints on others just because you think your goal is "obviously correct". 
Good day, sir.

So for one month, they could not pay bills and issued a state bond instead.  Since this was not legal tender, the federal government announced what they were doing was not legal.  Since this was not legal, *major banks* refused these state bonds.  Before the state vs federal rights battle could begin, California decided to pay off the bonds and continue living life in debt.  Some thing tells me Illinois, you know the state which Obama hails from, will not be doing the same thing mainly because it is not legal and this is not the fight that will begin the state vs federal legal battle (again, no politician wants to take that on right now for something as trivial as weed).

Circle does not want to pay phone companies to investigate fraud so they raise the risk rate of someone conducting transactions purely via mobile devices.

Because forcing everyone to have insurance requires cars to be safe and forces costs to go up for manufactures which pass the costs onto you and me.  Cars would only cost $1000 if we didn't mandate air bags, traction control, and back up cameras on everyone.  Do those mandates even make you safer?

I take from your response that you are using legacy to mean obsolete which means no longer used in preference of its replacement.  Which raises the question how has bitcoin replaced legacy banking?  It would appear that bitcoin compliments and exists alongside traditional banking.

crooked banksters steal money and subvert the economy by reducing the value of a dollar.  JP Morgan bank is the very definition of crooked filled with banksters which terrorize the financial economy without fear of penalty (in fact the opposite, they get bailed out with golden parachutes going to executives for a job well done)!  JP Morgan bank began waaaay before the fed, started by a single person named JP Morgan who was a USD early adopter.  JP Morgan used said money to do exactly what the fed does today (see Panic of 1907 for documented proof).   ergo, JP Morgan started out well above the rest of the peons and then used his power, money and might to help create the very federal reserve that exists today ensuring his cronies continue their reign of ~~terror~~ power.  
considering history often repeats  itself, you don't think the very same could happen again once the 21 millionth bitcoin has been mined (or before)?  you are being extremely naive if you think the federal reserve is a fluke-one-time-event-in-history-which-will-never-happen-again-because-bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-03-28 12:49:45
I think you are missing my point.  Banks will not go away.  Where are you going to get loans, where are people going to stow their large amounts of bitcoin to avoid theft, etc.  Yes you CAN go somewhere like btcjam if you need 1BTC in a bind, but you're not going to buy a house using btcjam.  You CAN throw your cold storage under your mattress but no one with a few million dollars will ever think of doing that.
SO if status quo will not change but make things more difficult for those without money how will bitcoin fix any of that.. because the richest of the rich have the ability to literally be their own bank like they always have been (JP Morgan comes to mind). Look I'm pro bitcoin too, but I am wary about the people with a lot of money.  They are the ones that generally do shit that put us in nefarious situations (Bush-Bin Laden, Timothy Gietner/Alan Greenspan, the entire LIBOR scandal, HSBC bank, the too big to fail banks/insurance companies, etc)

PROTIP: Stop connecting to them from a VPN/Proxy/Tor.  Also, make sure you have a credit history.
I used to get these problems with the legacy banking system over 10 years ago.  I finally opened a credit card (with a $300 limit) and lo and behold my problems went away (something something establish my identity without always providing utility bills).  Then recently, and only once, did I connect to circle while using my company's old vpn (which was hosted on amazon and had a vpn + mail server ports open) and they flagged my account.  A quick (phone) chat with the rep pointed connections out that the fraud system detected anomalous ports on my system consistent with botnet based traffic.
IP-Reputation based systems are on the rise and are here to stay.  This is why I always have had and will always continue to have a static ip address that i pay for on a credit card.  Can't change the world's rules?  Then I'll play by them my way.

whoa, the internet was around but had zero development.  there were very little ingress and egress points because the costs were ASTRONOMICAL at the time.  it took government subsidies to pay for everyone's access, AOL included.  
at the time AOL came around (1992),  GOPHER was the leading information protocol.  i don't know about you but GOPHER is text based and did not support images.  AOL was graphical from the start.  AOL had access to newsgroups from then.  newsgroups was considered the internet at the time and AOL did a very good job of presenting newsgroups to their users.
I was lucky enough to have an isp that supported the internet at the time, with  free speech being uncertain, there was next to nothing on the internet outside of some informational GOPHER sites, some internet connected MUDs and MOOs, and newgroups.  AOL had TONS of content, people games and other things to do.  please do not paint AOL as something corporations created to take over the internet.  it was created to take over bulliten board systems. the internet/winsock addon in aol 2.5 that released in 1996 actually CONNECTED AOL users to the internet and AOL formally became an ISP.  Prior to 1996, if you were alive and lucid then, there wasn't really an internet.. just an inter connected network of computers (for research)

What is being left out is the business value provided to shipping  and logistics companies, cardboard and plastic manufacturers, etc.  What do they gain by switching to BTC?   There are major costs involved with switching proprietary computer programs and systems, retraining employees and providing support for customers, etc etc.  You think they will do all of this to help a small coffeeshop or a farmer in Kenya?  Ha, okay.  Chicken and Egg, you can't have greater adoption without buy-in from the companies who provide economic velocity.  And with the economy steamrolling the way it is, you will need a pretty damn good reason to eg. retool all of UPS and their suppliers and their suppliers suppliers to support BTC (especially when they likely already have custom payment setups with all the major card companies and banks)
EDIT: now that I think about it, for me to ship something from my company's location in Brussels to my HQ in LA, I just ~~call up~~ *hop onto FedEx's website*, enter the package weight and dimensions, send the resulting shipping label to my operator in Brussels and FedEx shows up to take the package.

DRAM is called *Dynamic* Random Access Memory.  It is dynamic thus needs to be refreshed every 10ns or so.  The only power that remains after the main current is cut is what is leaking from capacitors.  The longest I know is the additional 15 seconds a Sun E10000k (or larger) system takes to power off after power is cut.  Your dell will probably last about 500ms.  If you have a RAID controller, power will remain until all buffers are flushed but even then you're powering x * .5A devices, so don't expect more than maybe 3 seconds.SRAM is Static Random Access Memory, [which has a much different implementation](
[Your belief's are based upon 1970s era technology](

as someone old enough, i don't think that was the case at all.  compuserve and prodigy each had something like 10 million users.  delphi, the first real nationwide ISP (gopher, ftp, uucp, usenet and email access) had 5-7 million users in 1992.  then there was AOL, i don't have to describe AOL's popularity do I?  AOL 2.5 introduced native winsock access to enable internet based applications.  this was 1995.
it's been 5 years for bitcoin, whats the user count at right now?  the estimate is 1 million.  yeaah...
EDIT: LOL i almost forgot, in 1994 Wildcat! BBS introduced winsock access to enable internet access through 50k *bulletin board systems*.  in 1994 the concept of desktop internet that is ubiquitous today was only 2 years old.  do you even windows 95 bro?

SMTP (protocol) was vulnerable to abuse, hence the need for DKIM and SPF.
HTTP did not have any vulnerabilities in the spec but how many HTTP clients and servers (open source) have vulnerabilities on a daily basis?

Right, but none of those laundering events happened within the united states becuase of AML/KYC.  They had to go to another country.  That is why i'm saying bitcoin replacing the worlds economy will not happen.  No developed nation supports anonymous payments.  None.  Saudi is not a first world nation.  Mexico is not a first world nation.  You have made no mention of Europe, China, or even India, where there is no such blatent disregard of laws (before you mention LIBOR, be sure to google LIBOR arrests).
So again, freedom is not free, there are some tradeoffs.  You cannot allow ISIS free reign in the USA or the Eurozone.  That is just not practical.  Here's a question for you.  Should we turn a blind eye and continue to allow mexican cartels to prosper?  Al-Qaeda to be funded indefinitely?  Would you be okay with a 9/11 style event happening in every major US city at the same time?  Because enabling anonymous payments enables exactly that.  Or maybe you want Comcast to be able to lobby for mandatory cable for everyone.  You would be powerless to stop that because they keep getting money and the FTC has no way to punish Comcast (comcast can just say what money, we have no money.  just like you can say to the dea what drug money, i didn't receive any money for drugs)

Nothing to do with stigma, entirely due to prevalence of theft and low probabilities of catching the crooks.  With bitcoin you can run it through tumblers and walk off scott free via localbitcoins.  It's not so easy with USD (gotta open or buy a tumbler business, business requires a legitimate identity, identities can be captured by surveillance equipment, etc).  
Now insurance will insure anything, but you have to be willing to pay a price for it.  Or in other words, the same reason you don't drive around with a $1m vehicle liability policy when you can only afford 25/50/25 (25/50 for the rest of you).

Right.  And there's no such thing as Chex Systems which can get the poor banned from opening checking accounts.

No overdraft, no insurance and thus lower prices for all poor people!  I have an idea, lets get Walmart to sponsor a bitcoin wallet so all poor people can use that.  
Who cares what you want when society obviously wants insurance on their cards.  Suck it up and deal, or use cash and bitcoin.. no one says you need to use a pre-paid card.  Just like I'm not going to use bitcoin because of my 5% rewards credit card.

If they are astronomical, why are banks insured?  Their technology is not much different from bitcoin.  If money is removed from an account, it doesn't magically get added back in like a calculator.  The bank has to sell an asset or take a loan, etc, to refund the customers loses.  The bank then needs to call up their insurance company and file a claim.  The insurance company may recoup some of the loses (arrest a criminal, find an abandoned stolen account) but the rest is materialized in higher rates to the bank and to the banking industry in general.  The banking industry then gets together to find ways to lower the risk of loses so they stop paying increasing premiums thanks to Little Rock Savings and Loan type backs always getting hacked.
You know why exchanges won't do it?  Because (a) razor-thin profit margins, (b) higher costs to do business (regular compliance audits, external security reviews, etc), (c) higher premiums due to avoidance of b, and (d) they don't want to work together.
Note circle and coinbase are insured, but note they have some ridiculous processing fees that doesn't make them any cheaper than visa or mastercard.

inb4 moores law.  moores law applies to transistor count


this does not correspond to linear growth of e.g. cpu cycles or ops.  for example, compare the ARM Cortex A8 and A9.  both follow moores law, however the A9 is only marginally faster than an A8.  however the floodgates opened beyond that with e.g. latest snapdragon and enoyxs cpus due to being multicore with advanced pipeline branching tricks.
that said, increasing transistor count means mining chips can move to multicore solutions.  think nvidia gpus with 500+ cores

You are saying things will happen but not providing any reasoning for why things will happen.
Why would early adopters sell out of the future currency?  Why would they take useless fiat currency if bitcoin is the way of the future?  People would be cashing out of the fiat ponzi scheme, so why would he or any of the large hodlers want to cash out?
Because 
* &gt;people find it useful or speculate on people finding it useful in the future
this would mean the holders of large amounts of coin find greater value in fiat than bitcoin. (you are pegging bitcoin to an arbitrary ponzi fiat system rather than the other way around)
* &gt;a lot of coins mined now are expensive so obviously it will get more evenly distributed
but if you have someone who is rich on bitcoins and can take loans against his bitcoins and other assets.. couldn't they continue to increase their bitcoin holdings or do you think they have enough and they won't possibly buy anymore.. a gentleman's agreement?
* &gt;Bitcoin is still in its early stages and nobody should have a ton of money relative to their net worth in it
but why not if
* &gt; More people will buy or they won't hardly anyone has any so there's tons of room for potential demand
you are saying more people are going to provide more demand, so why not put all of your net worth into to it now and let everyone else play catchup?

-[JP Morgan](
Fun fact: The government's inability to provide any sort of guarantee other than "we have money" led to the control by the 1% (Morgan and the Hienz family owning a majority of all of the national banks in 1907) unfortunately this didn't last and the 1% changed hands several times during the next 30 years.  The people who were caught in the web were the ordinary 99%.  With the creation of the FDIC, aimed for the people, the government was able to truly able to bring together the rich (insurers) with the poor (people with bank accounts) and mitigate bad actors who threatened everyone
^**WARNING:** ^I ^am ^going ^to ^give ^a ^History ^lesson ^at ^the ^risk ^of ^being ^ignored ^due ^to ^this ^post's ^length..
Who were some of the bad actors?  You can look internationally for them:
* [Sir Thomas McllWraith]( (australia)
* [The Baring Brothers, Jabez Spencer Balfour, Whitaker Wright, Horatio Bottomley, Clarence Hatry, and Lord
Kylsant]( (UK)
* [Charles Ponzi]( [Ivar Krueger]( [Samuel Insull]( (US)
[Here is an interesting document which shows the transition from individual causing financial scandals to corporations profiting from financial scandals](  What is interesting to note is before the US had control of the monetary system (pre-1930 FDIC) there was no shortage of scandal.  After the FDIC intertwined insurers money with individual money, the scandals shifted to corporate greed albeit at much lower frequencies (eg once per decade rather than once every few years).  After the 1970s [Nixon Shock]( the frequency of scandals dropped dramatically.  One only needs to look at what was done during this time to understand the benefits to everyone.
In 1913 the government created the Federal Reserve to ensure economic activity would not be disrupted by a few wealthy billionaires.  The rich at this time would cause volatility in the stock markets by using their large stash of USD to skew trades in their favor.  Or in other words, the pump and dump.  Typically only largecap companies weathered the storm (US Steel, Union Pacific, etc).  In 1930, during the great depression there was nothing the US could do to encourage economic activity.  The US [Government threw money at national projects, at corporate sponsored projects, but didn't do anything to address the lack of money in the majority of citizen's pockets.](  A majority of people did not have any money in their bank account and could not get loans.  In 1933, the government finally addressed the people by creating [the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation]( to oversee banking failures and ensure citizen's money was not lost when a bank collapsed.  40 years later [the same problems from 1930 which caused the great depression, pegging the economy to the gold standard]( began to appear again which prompted Nixon to remove our reliance on the gold standard.  [While at the time was seen as an attempt to hide Nixon's famous foreign and domestic blunders]( has been praised for allowing economies to grow based upon their economic output.
So, why are you bringing all of this up?  Because a lot of people in this sub, tend to believe that bitcoin and removal of the FDIC, going back to a gold (or other) standard, and allowing persons and corporations to control your money without providing insurance is a good thing.  But history has shown this to not be the case.  History has shown that the government sitting idly as bad actors manipulate the economy does not benefit the citizens.  Further, history has shown the US being unable to inject assets into the economy to weather a storm.  It took the US forcing the rich to look after the poor to allow our economy to grow^*.  With that said, we are not in a particularly bad state but I agree we should not wait until we are in a bad state.  With that said, we should not knee-jerk into old habits (eg be your own bank! get rid of FDIC!) nor should we follow directions which we know won't work (eg removing the fed and thus government's ability to help the poor).  We should entirely be aware of who we are giving our money to (eg [John D Rockafeller](  
I leave you with a comparison.  [Bitcoin does not allow governments to inflate the monetary supply]( ensuring the rich get richer while the poor have no recourse.  [Heavy handed tactics by those who own a majority of the monetary supply](  [Manipulation]( ([bitcoin for comparison](  So when I hear about Roger Ver, the Winklevoss twins, and others who control a large swatch of coins combined with hope that BTC replacing USD, I cringe.  Not because I don't think BTC and the blockchain is a bad, per-se. But the actors involved are questionable and the rich today could very well still be the rich tomorrow, ironically, with more control than they have currently! 
*Those who do not understand history are doomed to repeat it*.
*offtopic, this is why a lot of developing nations look at the US as a great example of 350 million people standing behind whatever they do.. good or bad.  hurricane? we'll rebuild.  home values lost? we'll repay. etc

Um, c++ is a language.  When you become a developer you do not automatically understand every technology that exists. 
Ever play any video games?  Some of those guys are brilliant at how they can compress and load millions of textures into miniscule memory spaces and still provide a 1080p 120fps experience.  You ask them about voip and they'll look at you like you had six heads.  They don't understand anything about QoS, IGMP, Call Managers etc  But I guess that's why they laugh at your inability to grasp how to transform a matrix with 6 different formulas while only using one core by utilizing a feature of the xbox platform that few people pay attention to.

There are flaws with your statement.
* banks are middlemen in all of fiat transactions and the world has no problems
* if the technology cannot spread by itself it means it's not intuitive enough. Computers have and always will be designed to make life easier.  There has been nothing here that describes ease over plastic or straight green cash.
* how do you refuse a job when you are making payments that doesn't even begin to make sense and it's not even really late here
It seems like these are all issues you have with bit coin and not necessarily the ones actual users care about (99% of money holders want their funds in a bank, 99% don't care about 1% inflation unless something happens to their 75% bills/student loans, 99% domt care how they get paid but do care about the hoops/time delay in getting their money, etc)

You do not need an SSN to activate.  Further, they ask for your address and name because the 16+4 credit card protocol requires it so they can insure your card (if someone else uses your card you are not liable).  Did you know you can change the address (and name) for any of these prepaid cards that you buy?
Further did you realize these prepaid cards still provide the same visa and mastercard $0 fraud liability?  You just have to prove you are the owner of the card (I don't know how else you would do that without your name and address and a matching ID)

you are making great points which are valid today, but to consider that valid you would have to consider tainted coins a reality.  if tainted coins are a reality, what other controls will be in place?  it wouldn't just be "oh lol we say tainted coins don't matter" when the government, in reality, is telling you that they do matter.

Welp, changing my business model now. See you soon, @_date: 2015-02-23 16:50:14
Back in 2002 when I started getting businesses on websites, I would charge $100 setup and $20/mo but I also included free redesigns once a year.  No one would call me back to update the sites.  When I reached out to them they would tell me they don't get enough traffic and they would cancel my service next year.  I had 56 companies total between 2002-2003 with only 10% (6 companies) staying on beyond one year.  My profit margin was something like 95% since it cost me about $4/year to host a website.  I was the sucker who helped.  Oddly enough some of those same people called me up almost 10 years later to restart there websites.  At this point I gave them "a deal" of the same price as valued customers.  They lapped it up and it costs me even less to run a website (pennies per year).  
But I told them they need someone to constantly update their menus.  Someone to update inventory.  Someone to respond to email requests and similar.  The majority that left said they didn't have the budget to train an employee and asked if I could do it for them.. Then they realized that had a price tag and they just cancelled altogether.  This is exactly what I see when I migrate businesses to bitcoin today.

I think the regulation is to ensure exchanges and the like don't act as a fractional reserve, thus *recreating everything you are bitching about*.  So regulation would enforce audits, just like regulation enforces audits on your favorite mcdonalds restaurant that you eat on the way to school.  Oh are you saying we should remove all regulation because you know it's illegal to poison people, so we can construct a case that food-borne illness is an act of assault.  I fully agree with you.  I have been blinded all these years.  The solution is to get rid of all regulations and just leave behind the laws that that already exist (wat?)

Meanwhile people with $5000 worth of BTC wake to find their wallet.dat missing or coinbase account liquidated due to lack of egress controls on their money.
Usually if I am spending $3000 on my debit or credit card, I have advance knowledge of it.  Like when I spent $10k on my wife's engagement ring.  I didn't go hurr durr I'm just going to whip out the card and charge it.  I made a 5 minute phone call to my bank, talked to my favorite rep about the weather and finally ended the call with "please extend my purchasing power, I am making a large payment".  They didn't even care to ask what the store was, just the amount and approximate time frame.  30 minutes later I walk into the shop and allow the jeweler to make the purchase.

yes systemd vs init.d is raising a huge concern, but that is not what an RFC is meant for.  we are not finding changes in say rsyslog's tcp implementation even though the original syslog daemon is long gone.  because syslog is a protocol which has been defined.  look at MIDI, that shit is on like version 1.02 and has survived without change for 20+ years now.
bitcoin relies on a protocol to communicate between nodes.  what is being said is that the protocol can change so rapidly that it is not worth creating an RFC for.  that is what causes interoption to lag.  I used windows as an example because kerberos is defined by RFC spec, windows enhancements did not follow that spec and existing customers suffered.  another example, look at google and HTTP/2.0.  they were going to push SDY as a valid protocol with RFCs and all.  W3C said whoa lets draft HTTP/2.0 which again is defined in an RFC. 
You all compare bitcoin to the beginning of the internet, this is it.  In the beginning there were standards, in the end there will be standards.  Those that do not have standards get phased out (windows 2000 for windows 2003 not less than 2 years later).

 i don't think you understand how much money governments truly have.  with money they have power and control.  all of those privacy networks you have described all have one common weakness: control of a majority of the nodes can break privacy.  if it's enough of a problem, the government will just spin up thousands of millions of nodes in their $500b utah datacenter.  so let me ask you, what will make it easier?

Wow, so why do we have courts and a judicial system.  Why are civilians allowed to use said judicial system to repossess assests?  Because debts are backed by nothing but a promise right?  Tell that to everyone that was foreclosed upon in 2008 because we owed our chinese partners a few trillion dollars in money.

Nah, I've sent anonymous flowers with a visa gift card.  I purchased the gift card with cash while wearing a ski mask (it was -10 degrees outside).

[You do realize that the primary goal for a company is to increase the wealth of its shareholders (owners) by paying dividends and/or causing the stock price to increase]( right?  This is business 101.  You should really take some business courses before you start saying such [naive fucking things](
You know what they call a company that does not operate solely to make a profit?  [A non-profit organization](  I can even provide proof.. what state do you live in (because you know forming a company or nonprofit is a state right, which is slightly different among each state)
EDIT: More LOLs, I provide proof and you people downvote.  "oh no, my narrative is not correct, LETS DOWNVOTE AND HIDE HIS COMMENT SO OTHERS DON'T FIGURE IT OUT".  Seriously just respond with what state you live in and I will show you exactly the kind of entities you can create (generally it follows: SOLE PROPRIETOR, LLC, LLP, C-CORP, S-CORP, Non-Profit).  Unless you are a sole proprietor, you have an obligation to maximize shareholder revenue.  LLCs can be considered a soleproprietor-ship (eg if Jeff Bezos is the sole owner of Amazon LLC, he doesn't have to maximize profit). Anything with more than one shareholder puts you at risk of being sued if you do not try in your best effort to maximize profits.  This is possible in LLCs, LLPs, C-CORPs, and S-CORPs.  Seriously this is the law.  If you don't like it, write your STATE politicans.  I don't understand why we can't have CRYTPO-CORPS.  I would rather that above all, but you idiots don't write your senators or congressmen and instead bitch here.  So when I write them they say "sorry there isn't enough interest in your state yet".

So what is stopping Wells fargo or Bank of America from doing the same thing?  Let's pretend you are sending Grammy $42 and you both use Bank of America which supports funding via Bitcoin.  You log into your bank address and click "My Bitcoin Address" and see your 26 character address.  ~~Meanwhile your grammy needs $42 so you just open your Bank of America app and click send money to grammy.  Grammy's phone buzzes and she has $42 instantly.~~  Oh wait my example needs to make sure we are using bitcoin.  
Sorry.  
So you don't use bank of america app, you instead open your bitcoin wallet after typing in your 36 character passphrase.  You ask Grammy to log into her Bank of America app and click "My Bitcoin Address".  She gives you a 21 character address.  That's not right.. You ask her again to clarify.  She gives you a 23 character address.  Just to be safe you ask again and she gives you a 29 character address.  Jesus Grammy, it's not supposed to be this hard.  Why don't you click send a QR.  So she clicks the Send QR button and puts in your email address.  7 minutes later the email arrives.  You scan the QR code and get the correct 27 character address.  
You calculate $42 based on the current exchange rate plus transactionfee you punch in 0.17233 and click send.  10 min later your Grammy asks where is the $42. You tell her it's on the way, it takes up to 30 minutes to transfer the money.  An additional 30 minutes pass, Grammy asks you again for the money.  You start looking into why she hasn't received the money yet.  Only 1 confirmation after 45 minutes, "hmm network is slow today".  You tell Grammy to keep waiting.  Finally Grammy's app buzzes. She calls you up "I asked for $42, you sent me $41.13.  Can you send me an additional 87 cents?
Now how can we create the killer app to reduce this mess?  If we had a centralized app we could just give people QR codes or email addresses and map bitcoin addressess there.  So we load up the ~~Bank of America~~ Coinbase app and do exactly that.


Hope this was an entertaining apples to apples comparison for you!

To be fair, do you think they really had a case before tackling Ross and stealing his bitcoin?  Think about it.  They don't have the staff to investigate his entire infrastructure, that cost money.  That is money that doesn't come out of thin air, instead it comes from asset forfeiture.  The asset is seized and sold before trial and those monies are then funneled back into that organization and used to help build a case for the trial.  Citizens benefit by acquiring goods.  Government gets money.  Accuser loses everything. 
Everything you find after the fact is just to build the story for your case.  Doesn't help they "found" his laptop logged into silkroad.  That's the lynchpin right there.  That and Ross was a clueless techy that found himself way over his head.  VJ ran that site for him and let Ross take the fall.

No it is not.  They both involve massive clustered computing crunching numbers.  Data mining is distributed computing (see mapreduce).  Funds confirmation is done via distributed computing as well.  
Data mining is done on newer hardware with new technology.  ACH confirmations used to be slow because they were on IBM or HP mainframes.  We have since migrated to almost 70% Linux.  All of our ACH systems have run on linux for almost 6 years now. We started rewriting our ACH interface to use modern technologies 3 years ago.  **all we need to do is flip a switch**
However Suntrust bank (example) may not have these setup yet.  Guess who is going to congress asking for a delay on ACH changes?  Guess who's going to come to us asking for help once the regulation gets changed?  Look at Citibank.  They were able to shed fat and restructured ALL of their systems. They went from $3 to $50+.  Expect Bank of america, jp morgan chase, PNC, etc all to do exactly the same thing over the next few years.

Just because you can't doesn't mean others would not.  Think about it this way.  Roger Ver or Satoshi, or Karpeles, or Charlie Shrem, Don Draper. whoever.  They have a fuckton of coins.  They keep aquiring coins while you are aquiring coins.  Suddenly Coinbase who also owns a metric fuckton of coins says they are branching into a different coinspace which keeps the same merits of bitcoin.  Draper and Ver and Karpeles and Satoshi all chime in agreement.  You and you alone cannot see why anyone wants to go this way and you become an outlier.

Quantum computing does not break secure Internet, it breaks encryption where the key is mutually derived or public key infrastructures.  Shared key algorithms are still near impossible to break (but vulnerable through other means, such as eavesdropping) but elliptical curve is not impossible to break since private keys are not required in the final encryption sequence.  So all we would have to do is move to elliptical curve or rely heavily on shared key algos.  Elliptical curve is being tweaked and tested now, I'm sure as cpus increase in speed we will see it become more mainstream.  For instance, SSH is already moving towards an elliptical curve style formula.  HTTPS would be broken, but just as we migrated from SSL1 to SSL2 to TLS1, TLS2, and now TLS3, we would just migrate to ECDLP256.  Just as SHA1 was broken and SHA2 took over, ECDLP would be the next logical step.

Which is why I think this whole bitcoin fad is going to reach a toppling point this year or early next year.  Especially when they realize they could have gotten rich just like everyone else by investing in popular stocks and funds.. just like everyone else.
I used to have the same level of anger shared in this sub, lack of money, mad at economic crashes and rich people walking away richer.  But getting angry is not the same as doing something.  So after the dotcom bust, I said I'm going to ride the next wave.  If anyone didn't see the housing bubble coming, they were blinded with getting rich now (woo my house is worth 50% more --- for no good reason!).  
Thats why I'm pointing out, we are currently in an oil bust.  If anyone thinks oil is going to stay low only needs to look at a historical graph of the price of oil.  If people do not have money, they need to fix that problem.  Bitcoin won't help... In fact, if those people were to go broke after Bitcoin replaced USD.. how would they get more money?  They can't overdraft their own bank(they have no money to lend to themselves). They can't go to the government for a handout (the government has a finite limit of how much money they have too).

oh really?  here is how you can become rich off an economic crash just like "those big bankers that are too big to fail".
Put money in government bonds.  When the economic crash is over, buy stocks and mutual funds with your more powerful dollar.  Tada!  Making money by inflation, or in other words putting your money to work for you.
For instance, do we really think oil will be $50/barrel for ever?  No, so why aren't you putting all your available money into OIL stocks, etfs and mutual funds?  $OIL is ~$11/share.  It used to be $40.  You think oil will go back up to even $70/barrel?  That's 25%.  Your $11 investment today will be worth $15 tomorrow.

Right you would want a split in bitcoin, physical assets, rare and precious metals and various currencies used around the world.  Asset management 101.  But that doesn't explain how that allows bitcoin to reach such highs without having more money buy in for support. For the price to go up, demand has to go up.  If one of the largest holders is cashing out, what does that mean for everyone else getting in?  They are the demand.  Who will continue to supply the demand to the late adopters as the early adopters cash out (back to USD/EUR/JPY/CYN,physical assets,rare metals, oil, etc)?  
I'm here because someone said speculation leads to spreading of coins.  I pointed out several people own a majority of coins which is the antithesis of spreading of coins.  You started rambling some nonsense that Gavin should sell his coins and use the fiat profits for consumption which is completely against the purpose of Satoshi's Bitcoin.

so what makes this post any better?  there is nothing wrong with the "usd protocol" either.  just as the bitcoins in your wallet are not affected with BTER's hack, the cash in my wallet and money in my bank account is not affected by this billion dollar hack.  in both cases, someone's insurance company will be cutting a check and also hiring investigators to try to recover some of their money.  in the case of bitcoin it is much harder compared to usd and thus insurance rates for bitcoin are dramatically higher.  but in both cases, the majority of end users are not affected (except for anyone who's coins or cash were tied up in the hacks)

Think outside the box.  The firmware is modified to detect NTFS partitions.  When the filesystem is read it can detect certain bytes that are being read.  For instance whenever an executable is accessed it can look ahead (since it knows the structures of NTFS and PE executables) scan to see if it's some win32.sys file and instead replace it with a compromised version.  Now you are actively executing malware which CAN communicate with TCP/IP.  This malware can understand NTFS/PE, FAT/PE, FAT/ELF, ext2/ext3/ext4/ELF.  But like all malware it is limited by firmware storage and may not understand HP-SAS RAID, EMC RAID, etc.  Or maybe those are the only targets for enterprise environments.  Who knows, but the bottom line is it is theoretically possible.
And before you continue down the road of 'hur durr not possible' just google [Blue Pill]( and [TRESOR]( - [HUNT](  Good day!

Btw you just described OpenMosix.  A linux kernel patch for distributed computing from 2003. All your systems are compiled with network support (infiniband at the time) and then communicate with each other over a dedicated (optionally encrypted) link from boot (eg memory space from systems A(N-1) are available to any system).  The blockchain is a horrible idea for this, considering it is (a) write once, (b) limited to mining confirmation and subject to hashrate attacks, and (c) infiniband was 10GB and only provided a 3x improvement on single threaded applications.  Parallel processing bumped this to 200x.   You can see this technology in use today in VMWare vSphere, Oracle Solaris Zones, and various mapreduce technologies include Hadoop and Mongo.

You know why I question bitcoin?
Look at every other industry-changing protocol or protocol enhancement and look at how quickly it has been adopted: BitTorrent, HTTP/2 (or even http/1.0), DKIM, etc.
Look at every other opensource product that is not *much* different from existing products but has quick adoption: Linux, iptables vs ipchains, Openstack, Docker, etc.
It's been 5 years and we're still vying for that Killer App.  Meanwhile Openstack is being implemented by major enterprises across the world.  Linux had early support from entrenched companies (eg. IBM), same with Docker (Windows support).
This *technology* will likely be used heavily in the future, but bitcoin and blockchain as we know it won't survive outside of hobbyist projects.
i said early on bitcoin should be called a digital currency.  i also said bitcoin should have been called the Linux of the payment industry similar to how Openstack dubbed themselves the Linux of cloud tech.  instead you chose "be your own bank" putting the tech at odds with the giant finance industry.  you chose virtual currency, making people think of funny money (eg we don't call email virtual messages, we call it digital messages).  not to mention the board of the bitcoin foundation which is a who's who of persons with illegal, near illegal, and questionable activity.  
not good, bitcoin, not good.

so.. exactly what credit cards perform today (except a merchant isn't held hostage at the whim of a bad actor).  Oh wait doesn't paypal do the same thing, shock!  But I bet I am only focusing on my use cases again.  No one else uses credit cards or paypal in that manner what so ever.


Please link to where I have said that.  I never said I don't like bitcoin. I said it is ridiculous to rip and replace a working solution with something that provides no added value.  EVerything you have just talked about that bitcoin fixes or provides is already done with existing systems.


where you alive in 2000 during the dotcom boom? when millions of VC funding was pumped into ridiculous business ideas that ultimately failed.  Dialpad.com and pets.com are two well known busts that ate hundreds of millions of VC funding.  So how exactly does VC funding equate success?  (where are all those dot coms with VC funding now?)


Yes.  But nothing earth shattering enough to replace an entire banking and payment system.  I have said numerous times before the blockchain and the concept behind cryptocurrencies have many uses *outside of payment processing*.  Hell, I've said Western Union likely uses bitcoin for sending money between regions.
