As a fellow developer are you as perplexed by this whole thing as I am?
I’ll make up my own mind soon enough about how the network should scale but I’m finding it difficult to be objective. It’s like both sides are arguing two sides of the same coin. LN sounds great but, and it’s a big but, why is this being sold as the holy grail solution? The most likely future result will come from a series of changes to core, block sizes (I mean come on anyone heard of Moore’s law), side channels and add-ons
Where will you start?

For what it’s worth I’m struggling to see LN be the magic bullet. It seems like a solution that needs to be worked on in parallel to core but from what I understand it’s the main talking point here. Difficult to know for sure if just because it’s a popular topic or because it’s cores main focus.
