Trump is still wrong about cryptocurrencies in general, however, that tweet thread reads like someone else wrote it.  I don't think he actually believes most of what was posted about cryptocurrencies... But even if he did write it, that doesn't make blockchain technology any less critical.
Remember, it's not Bitcoin (BTC) that makes cryptocurrency what it is, blockchain technology is the future regardless of what form it comes in.  If Trump was educated on blockchain and initiated a USD cryptocurrency that followed Satoshi's whitepaper as Bitcoin has I wouldn't be angry at all.

I agree, which is why we need bitcoin and merchants need to accept bitcoin directly rather than going through Visa/Mastercard or a bank of any kind.
@_date: 2019-08-26 22:07:23
ok well you didn't say that before.... however, I'd be real surprised if there was a way to use Visa/Mastercard without KYC aside from buying a pre-paid card using Bitcoin somewhere... Thats kinda how Visa/Mastercard work, they want to know who you are because information is like money to them.

Honestly, you could argue this both ways, I can think of a couple ways this could be legit (well... as legit as pump and dump schemes are anyway, I see guys doing this kinda stuff on a daily basis)
But from my experience, getting a business registered with the UK can be done by anyone, from literally anywhere it doesn't mean someone's not trying to scam you.
And for the record, the majority of miners don't hold anything, they sell pretty much immediately because they need return on their investment, the quicker the return, the faster they can add more hardware to mine more and make more.
Bottom line is, if it seems too good to be true, it probably is.

@_date: 2019-06-08 05:13:41
No, you're a bank piss off... Cryptocurrency at its core is anti-bank, you defeat the entire purpose of the platform.
Edit: seriously did any of you people even read their FAQ? How the hell do you make transactions OFF CHAIN and call that secure and/or private?  Its not secure because if your transactions happen off chain then the person spending the Currency can just go and immediately move it on-chain and you dumbasses get nothing, then you have to use your insurance to pay off what is essentially a loop hole in the crypto market which will cause double-spending to be not only possible but very very common.  Usage of the "insurance" will force your company to start charging fees and people will leave en masse or you will start hiding your fees like every other corrupt bank does.

I'm pretty sure that if you want to send the coins from a bitcoin core wallet to somewhere else, you need to let the blockchain finish syncing, if you don't have the space on your hard drive I highly suggest you go buy another one, even an external USB drive will work, they aren't that expensive anymore, you can pickup at least a 1tb drive for under $100

Blockchain tech can literally be used for anything, It is a massive database and anyone in tech fields know how universally useful databases are.  It could be used to keep medical records for the life of an individual regardless of healthcare provider.  It could also be used in peer to peer contracts, cutting out middle men and allowing business owners to interact directly with consumers without the need for an intermediary, this encourages people to work together to resolve problems rather than litigate them.

Eventually, it will be both - However currently I think its only mainstream use (by this I mean, the things its mainly used for not what its always used for) is to facilitate the transfer of Fiat money in a secure way with peer to peer transactions.  I would love to see Bitcoin be the type of money that literally everyone almost always uses but we're really not there yet.  
IMO, employee's should be asking, poking and prodding their employers to pay them in Bitcoin rather than whatever your native currency is.
@_date: 2019-06-23 08:43:42
Good addendum!  I did assume the OP was coming in with USD just based on the way the question was phrased, but you are correct, if you're already holding BTC it does make more sense to look at satoshi value.
End game is important, but there's definitely nothing wrong with going after more USD in the short term, in order to use it to buy more BTC (or *insert whatever coin you want here*) if your "end game" is for example holding as much crypto as you can =)

@_date: 2019-06-10 04:47:16
Let me break this down for you:


Bitcoin Core is already doing the same things for Bitcoin as you can do with traditional money and then some, there are even things built into Bitcoin core that you LOSE when you choose a service like Crypterium, like the ability to send a message along with the coins.  Please name one thing Crypterium does that Bitcoin Core does not.


This literally means nothing, I don't care what rich dude wants to support you, and neither do the majority of people on the planet, your measily 400,000 registered users is a needle in a haystack compared to the 7+ billion people on earth who will one day use bitcoin from their own secured personal wallets on a day to day basis.


This isn't "my perspective" I'm giving you facts and asked valid questions and all you can give me a non-answers that don't even relate to the question posed.


Thanks for that, however I'm not looking for your respect either.  I'd be more interested in hearing what makes you different from big banks like BoA or Chase.


I already do seek other means of buying crypto, Coinbase already makes it super easy and I can then send those coins anywhere I want for literally zero fees.  This isn't my "point of view" these are facts and logic.  






Sure, have whatever opinion you want, but you don't get to decide where or how I voice my opinion on you since you are a public company on a public forum, aside from that like I said before, these are not my opinions in regards to cryptocurrency.  I deal in facts and logic, something you have yet to provide.
@_date: 2019-06-15 04:02:20
With Coinbase Pro, the sales are instant, if you've waited 4 days you're looking for your funds in the wrong place...
@_date: 2019-06-26 05:59:27
Well, here's the deal... The wallets I found are literally the exact same thing, minus the bitcoin logo on the front, however, the site I found does personalizations (which only cost $5) so you could just have them print the logo on it for you.  It took me all of 5 minutes to find the exact wallet.  I'm sure anyone who doesn't want to pay the asinine price can do the same.
@_date: 2019-06-26 07:08:36


Did I say that? I don't think I did say "all"... But you're not wrong, most businesses do markup their junk 100% - I don't shop at those places.  If you do your homework, you'll find companies that don't, in my case, they are local companies.

in the current moment, how you get to the alts is irrelevant for the most part, you can buy them with BTC or buy them with USD, but not all alts can be purchased with USD, but if you buy BTC with USD and then immediately buy the alt with BTC you're getting the same value of the alt in USD.
The problem is prices change all the time and then there are also fees, so the more times you convert one currency to another you're likely paying more fees.
Basically, if your goal is to get the alt coin and not BTC and you can buy directly with USD, do it that way, if you can't buy the alt coin with USD, you have to buy BTC first and then exchange it.
@_date: 2019-06-23 07:45:21
eth is a bad example to use, it is also high compared to 6 months ago, just like bitcoin... But in general, when you see an alt coin going down when bitcoin is going up that can mean it will then go up when BTC goes down/pulls back
nothing is certain though, so don't blame me if you lose all your money to alt coins.

I'm not flooding or spreading FUD, the facts are simple.  Bitcoin Core is the only app necessary to make Bitcoin a global currency which also makes yours and your "bank" irrelevant.  "Insurance" is the only thing you provide that Bitcoin Core does not and "Insuring" something which has limited quantities only does one thing: artificially inflates the value.
The fact that you keep coming back here to defend yourself only makes this look more like a scam, while your intentions may not be a scam, it doesn't change the fact that your "bank" is not necessary for Bitcoin to survive and thrive.  In fact it has done just that since it was created, and it did that without you and your bank/app
You can't even answer the simple question posed: When employers are paying their employee's in Bitcoin directly to their personal wallet of choice what good are you?  What does your app/bank give me that a personal wallet does not?
If your coins are not on a hardware wallet, they are at risk, plain and simple.  If your funds are on anything attached to the internet, they are at risk.  Show me one Network Security professional who would disagree with that statement.
We don't need banks either current or newly created to bring cryptocurrency to the world.  All that is necessary is word of mouth and communication between miners and users.  Bitcoin exists to "cut out the middle man" as a bank you are acting as a third party between the miners and the users, you are a "middle man" which is in direct contradiction to the very reason Bitcoin was created to begin with.

The saddest part of your replies is that I understand everything you're saying.  But what you don't seem to understand is that nothing online is 100% safe.  I use coinbase daily, I understand the risks and accept them.
Stop being a shill and understand that the only way to truly secure anything digital (cryptocurrency included) is literally to unplug the ethernet cable (or whatever medium you're using to connect)
I'm done trying to make this same point over and over again in a pointless argument where you don't even acknowledge the point I'm making.  In this instance we can't even agree to disagree because you're not even arguing with my point any longer.  Telling people that their digital assets are 100% safe on any platform is the most fucking stupid thing I've ever heard in my life and any Network Security specialist will agree with me.

This is how markets work, is it possible that at some point in the future Bitcoin stabilizes? sure... but we are years away from any of that happening, whether its the last currency on earth or not.  But the simple fact is that it can't be and never will be, so to make that assumption is asinine.

I've been using Coinbase for 2 years without issues.  However, I understand the risks of leaving my coins on an always online exchange and I accept those risks.  The reward outweighs the risk for me right now.  Maybe at some point in the future this will change.  But I will be the first one to tell you that your coins are not safe to store online. 
However, the OP is asking about places to buy, I've made several buys and can move my coins wherever I want after that with almost no fee's.
If you have a better place to buy than coinbase by all means, share the link.  But I feel like if you knew of one, you'd have put the link in your post, but you didn't.... so until you can provide a better alternative, how about you shut your face? Kthanksbye

DYOR is most definitely the way to go here, and I explained why.  I'll even add that, I'm to lazy to write you a mini booklet on reddit about economics.  
Nothing I claimed is absurd, but everything the OP claimed, and everything you are arguing, is very absurd.  It's not my fault you're not intelligent enough to get it.
Gold used to be directly tied to USD currency, Reagan did away with the direct links, but indirectly every time you spend cash, you're trading with gold, among other things.  Its really basic economics, seriously, go read a book or a website about it, its not hard.  I'm not going to reply to you anymore, if you want answers go find them, I'm not your high school teacher.

This type of risk will probably always be very real, but the average person probably doesn't need to worry about it, especially if you know computers well enough to ensure you're not running some type of spyware that would record this info and send it out.  You can monitor these types of things.  Most routers log where traffic is coming from and going to, so you could easily detect this type of activity.

lol... what a fraud... Satoshi would never reveal him/herself its not the way Satoshi's vision works.  I'm sure the real Satoshi knows this, but if anyone ever found out who the real Satoshi is, they would be assassinated for sure, almost immediately.  This blockchain tech is game changing and Satoshi knows it, as does anyone else with half a brain.
This is just a sad attempt to trick the real Satoshi into revealing who they are, I hope it doesn't work.  I also don't believe the guy from China who filed copyright is Satoshi either.

You have to report to the IRS in essentially a manual way right now, so if you bought 5 years ago and didn't sell anything until today, on your tax return next year you would need to enter basically what you gained from the sale, so you'd take the price you sold at multiplied by how much you sold, and subtract the price you bought at multiplied by how much you sold.  this gives you the total gained which is all the IRS really cares about, it all falls under capital gains taxes and works basically the same way buy and selling stocks does.
TLDR: it doesn't matter when you bought, but you only pay taxes on the profits when you sell.
@_date: 2019-05-23 20:19:16
I literally just said that.... But just because they haven't been hacked yet, doesn't mean they never will be.  If you were a hacker, who would you pick... The exchange with the largest market cap or the one ranked under  on the list of market cap by volume traded?
If you keep your cryptocurrency on an always online exchange you are taking the risk of losing everything to hackers, the only way to secure anything digital is by physically disconnecting the internet.

Wrong, You're missing a key term here which is to store your coins in a "Hardware wallet" as in, something not connected to the Internet all the time.  You can buy little hardware wallets like the Ledger or you could even setup an old crappy desktop in your house somewhere offline to store your coins, if its not online it can't be hacked remotely, kinda like storing your cash in a safe in your basement.

Its pretty simple to go to Binance and see over 1 million in LTC volume traded in the last 24 hours, vs coinbases measly 200k thoroughly proving my point.  
Not to mention the fact that you're completely ignoring my other point which is by far more important than "who has the bigger market cap"
Either way, you're still wrong.
