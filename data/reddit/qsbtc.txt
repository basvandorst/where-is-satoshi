From what I understand is that all BTC balances are secured by bitgo, and that bitgo will sign all transactions that bitfinex asks them to sign (ideally up to certain limits). I am not exactly sure how requests to sign transactions are handled.

If users all of a sudden were able to trade their positions that had bitcoin priced ~10% lower then the last time they were able to trade them, then they may be forced to liquidate their long positions and/or wish to sell their bitcoin held on bitfinex.

That does not appear to be the case. Bitfinex has said that not all customer funds have been stolen. 
BitGo is probably not very good for security, I would say they are better for proof of solvency. This seems to be somewhat of a tradeoff.

I understand that you can use BTC as collateral for a short BTC position. So if you had 100 BTC in your trading account, you could use that 100 BTC as collateral for a 200 BTC margin loan, and then sell that 200 BTC that you borrowed. 
I understand that you would have had to first converted that 100 BTC to USD via your exchange wallet in order to have USD in your trading account.

Selling equity would actually probably be a very good idea, assuming that bitfinex has the capital to cover a significant portion of the losses. 
It would allow customers to remain whole, allow bitfinex to continue operations, and allow some investors to potentially make a healthy profit. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:37:35
I understand that polinex did something similar to this successfully. 
I guess it would be a good investment if you trust bitfinex enough to (essentially) lend to them for several months. 
Many big banks also did this during the financial crisis, and for the most part, their investors were able to profit handsomely. Although to be fair, a good number of small banks ended up not repaying their TARP funds at all.

I suspect that this is some kind of scam designed to trick people into buying up a whole bunch of bitcoin with the hopes that some large government entity will be buying a million bitcoin in the future. 
I am no expert in espionage, however I suspect that the value of this kind of information goes significantly down once it is publicly known that someone else knows about it.

@_date: 2016-08-03 00:21:36
I don't think BitGo is for transaction speed. Neither bitfinex, nor bitstamp are affected by slow transactions. Please don't make this about the block size debate.
I think BitGo has been implemented in order to give the appearance of security, and safety, while from what it looks like, it may have actually decreased safety. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 00:19:27
I don't think BitGo is quite like having all your funds in your hot wallet. In order to breach a hot wallet, an attacker will need to compromise one system, one that contains the private keys, in order to steal BTC. With BitGo, an attacker will need to compromise two (ideally separate) systems, one that contains the signing key, one that communicates with the BitGo servers (and possibly a third that contains a list of which keys sign what addresses). There are also apparently limits that you can tell BitGo to adhere to in terms of how much to sign per day, although it appears as if the attacker was able to get around these limits somehow. 
If BitGo were to get hacked, then an exchange would simply be unable to spend any of their BTC until they retrieve their cold signing keys from cold storage. 
I think that running a full node has absolutely nothing to do with the bitfinex hack. From what I can tell, bitfinex received zero fake/invalid transactions that helped in any way the hack. It is even possible, under certain scenarios that the BitGo implementation actually prevented further theft of bitfinex's BTC.
I would also say with a good amount of certainty that bitfinex almost certainly runs multiple full nodes (the same is likely true for bitstamp)
@_date: 2016-08-03 03:35:56
~~If that is true, then it is possible that the attacker used his own BitGo address as the change address,  and tricked BitGo into thinking that they were signing an internal transfer transaction.~~
If that is true, then maybe the attacker gave BitGo two new sets of public keys to create multi-sig addresses with (along with the BitGo keys), then told BitGo to make internal transfers to these newly created multi-sig addresses, of which the attacker had two private keys to (and BigGo had one -- bitfinex had zero), then spent the BTC to his "normal" (non-multi-sig) address. 
Do you happen to have a link to where this was posted?
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:41:59
I don't think they lost all of their customer BTC. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:41:55
Well to put things in perspective, when bitstamp was hacked in Jan 2015, they lost ~19,000 BTC, which I believe represented ~3.5% of their total BTC. This represented &lt;100% of their capital, meaning they had &gt;100% of customer funds in cold storage. 
Simple math reveals that, as of Jan 2015, Bitstamp had roughly 542k BTC in total. I am not 100% sure how large bitfinex is compared to Bitstamp, however bitfinex does have a more liquid order book, has higher trading volumes, and offers margin trading, all of which suggest they would have more BTC then bitstamp. 
If bitfinex was holding the same number of BTC as bitstamp was when they were last hacked, then roughly 22% of their bitcoin was stolen. I suspect that bitfinex has more coins then what bitstamp had in Jan 2015, so I think the losses will probably be less.  
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:38:38

@_date: 2016-08-03 00:32:52
One of Bitcoin's main qualities/features is not immutability, I am not sure where you got this from. Satoshi said in the whitepapter (in paragraph 6) that it is possible for someone with enough CPU power to reverse transactions, but that they have an incentive (the block subsidy and the transaction fees) not to. If bitfinex were to offer the miners, say 2x what they lost as a result of doing a reorg then the miners would have a greater incentive to work on a chain that prevents the attacker from spending any of the coins that he stole, even from bitfinex. 
This is one reason why Bitcoin needs to scale enough so that transaction fees can be sufficiently greater then most transactions. 
One reason why I do not like this is because it opens things up for too much potential abuse, and it would erode confidence in Bitcoin for very large transactions. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:20:30
Well those losses are greater then the total amount of swaps, and it is not possible lose more then 100% of your deposit. 
I assume that the bitcoin that was stolen was not exclusively stolen from trading wallets, so 72 million will not necessarily be taken from swap holders. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 00:09:20
Do you have any kind of estimate and/or range of potential losses that lenders might be able to expect?
@_date: 2016-08-03 02:13:14
I know for a fact that there are limits with BitGo because I have had a number of situations in which my withdrawals were delayed because I had exceeded the 24 hour limit as to how much could be withdrawn from my account, and an admin had to approve the withdrawals. 
From what I understand, the attacker was somehow about to get around the limits. 
It is also possible that BitGo altered bitfinex at one point when an abnormal amount of transactions were being sent to them. 
@_date: 2016-08-17 04:09:47

Regardless of *any* of the above, there is simply no money to go around. Even if you were to win a judgment against them, there would not be sufficient money to pay out.

$40M in swaps would not even cover the theft. I looked on their walletexplorer.com wallet, and came up generally empty handed as far as finding substantially sized wallets (that doesn't mean they don't exist). It was [posted]( that bitfinex claims to have 1MM+ BTC in multisig addresses, and if this was the case then only ~12% of customer BTC would be lost, and much less would be lost once you factor in fiat, LTC, and ETH/ETC.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:55:16
The progress is good. Although the losses are much higher then I was hoping for.

@_date: 2016-08-03 23:32:51
I don't think any of this means that bitfinex can say "we got 'hacked' so we don't have to give you your money" 
It would be impossible to prove they were actually hacked if they were to try something like this anyway.

The risk of an explicit 51% attack by a mining pool is unlikely for the reasons listed. It would however be possible that a pool with 51% of the network do malicious things like orphan 5% of blocks that do not belong to them. 
It would still be possible for a single entity that controls 51% of the network hashrate (eg they own these miners) to mine on two+ different pools that they have explicit control over and perform some kind of 51% attack. 
I generally believe that the risk of a 51% attack is a lot lower than a lot of people fear it to be. 
@_date: 2017-02-19 14:08:30
I am not so sure about this.
The barrier for starting to hold/own your own bitcoin is very low, and the introduction of HW wallets like trezor make this barrier even lower. It has long made sense for someone owning GBTC to sell their GBTC and buy BTC with equivalent amount of funds, which would result in an asset that matches the price of BTC more closely, and has a cheaper price. 
None of this has anything to do with COIN or any other ETF.

What exactly will a node do if the miners tried to change the consensus rules? 
Your node might reject the transaction/block, however your node would do nothing to prevent others from accepting the block in question, and if enough people accept transactions dependent on the block in question, then the consensus rules have effectively changed....despite the fact that you are running a full node.

This proposal is essentially forcing a subset of users (the miners) to upgrade who don't otherwise want to upgrade -- if miners do not upgrade then they will be unable to validate any blocks sent to them, and will have no idea if the blocks they are creating are valid or not. 
The miners are supposed to provide security to the Bitcoin network, this proposal would do nothing other than weaken this security. 
This proposal would also centralize decision making of what gets implemented in the Bitcoin network, as those who control bitcoin.org and bitcointalk will be able to nudge users to "upgrade" by advertising that a new client has been released, and many users will blindly "upgrade" to the newest version.

If you are going to use LN, you will still need to run a full node to ensure that your channel is funded with unspent outputs, and to monitor for a closing transaction of your LN channel. It will probably be more important to run a full node than it is now if LN becomes prevalent. If the cost of a full node is 12% of the GDP, then it will probably not be economical to use Bitcoin with LN -- however if using a SPV node is safe (as it generally is today), then lower transaction fees would help very poor countries.

A 2 Mb HF (and/or with a xx% annual increase) would be one way to increase the max block size that would be more simple than SegWit. 
In order to make a change like SegWit, there needs to be consensus among a number of parties in order for it to be implemented, primarily the economy (users/businesses), and the miners. There is clearly not consensus among the miners for SegWit, and from what I can tell, there is not consensus among the economy either.

This will ultimately reduce the amount of money that Coinbase looses due to ID theft related fraud.

The total claims are known, the total assets of the Gox estate are known. The bankruptcy seems to be winding down. 
It shouldn't be too difficult to calculate the percentage of claims are likely going to be paid out by the trustee, and not much more difficult for a hedge fund to calculate how much to offer in order to get a decent rate of return.

Much of the recent rally over the past year or so has been credited to bids coming out of China to buy up BTC in order to get out of CNY.

Gemini is great for smaller amounts. The daily limit for ACH deposits is $500, with no option for this to increase, however users can generally use this money instantly to buy BTC. 
The fee for using Gemini is probably a tad bit higher verses using GDAX (if you live in a state that supports the USD wallet) at 0.25% for Gemini customers and 0.2% for Coinbase/GDAX customers. Coinbase also allows customers to transfer $10k via ACH per day, although it takes about a week to be available for use. 
Liquidity is also not good on Gemini as it is often difficult to trade six figures worth of BTC without significant slippage.

Unfortunately the decentralized exchanges that hold neither fiat nor BTC will essentially need to facilitate face-to-face meet ups for users to trade BTC/USD, and these meet ups have a very high scam/scam attempt rate, and it is very inefficient to trade this way.

The miners can engage in merged mining on the other chains, withhold the broadcasting of the finding of blocks on other chains until they would be able to create a long reorg.

I don't see why you would say they have not learned from their mistake. Their post actually implies the opposite when it says they will suspend deposits and withdrawals in the event of a fork. 
If Coinbase were to make the same mistake again, then it probably would not cost them anything. It currently takes 100 confirmations for the bitcoin mined in a found block to become spendable, and the miners cannot sell this bitcoin while they are waiting for these 100 confirmations. A miner mining on the minority fork would find the same number of blocks as before a fork, but would need to wait 4x as long (in terms of time) to be able to sell his coins, and considering that a minority fork would have a greatly diminished security, it's value would likely start to crash. All of this added together means that the miners have very high incentives not to mine on a minority fork, meaning that a minority fork will likely have very few additional blocks found after a fork.

@_date: 2017-02-26 07:19:36
You are kidding right?
If you are going to say that the nodes decide what blocks are valid, and the miners have no say in this (which is crazy BTW), then a single malicious node could connect to a miner and feed them an invalid block that would result in the miner starting work on top of said invalid block.
BTW, what happened to all the outrage over SPV mining? What you are saying is that miners should not even attempt to validate blocks, period. ???
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:42:38
The miners are the ones who provide Bitcoin security. If they are mining on an "altcoin" then what you perceive to be "Bitcoin" will be less secure, and more susceptible to attacks, even if, and especially if the POW is changed. 
@_date: 2017-03-23 23:08:00
SegWit still severely limits the number of transactions, and the signature discounts that SegWit offers is designed to make it less expensive (lower tx fee) to use LN verses traditional on-chain transactions because of the higher amount of signature data that LN opening/closing will use. 
I would personally like to see BIP101/XT activate because of the predictable capacity increases that will likely exceed that of demand for transactions, but fall short of the increases in technology, and if it turns out that the capacity increases that XT calls for is too quick, it can be slowed via soft forks (or more preferably a series of soft forks). 
Since it is unlikely that BIP101/XT is going to activate, my second choice is BU. It does need a better development team/process though. 
@_date: 2017-03-04 07:52:20


You think that Ver and Wu want a smaller transaction capacity.....you do realize they are strongly for on-chain scaling that involves lowering the per-tx cost right?
@_date: 2017-03-08 00:25:55
You are wrong. USAF will split the network into multiple chains, and if exchanges (and other users) are not careful, then they will send BTC on all chains when the customer is only withdrawing BTC on a single chain with little value. 
@_date: 2017-03-24 03:22:45
Maybe, but probably not. 
You should remember that if you use Gemini, and someone had recently sold $100k worth of BTC that you might have to sell your coins for a discount verses other exchanges if you need to sell right then (or vice versa). So even for small players, liquidity should be important. 
I still think that Gemini is a good exchange (I personally use them often), especially for smaller users, however I would still suggest that you not use them exclusively.

@_date: 2017-03-12 21:58:23
Yes, however the long term effect of SegWit is that most transactions (and their fees) will likely move onto LN and Thunder. 
The tradeoff is more transactions today in exchange for many less transactions in the future. 
Miners can also mine more transactions per block if there is an increase in the maximum block size. 
@_date: 2017-03-08 07:14:45
Irrelevant. My above point is still why Core has such a high percentage of the nodes.  
@_date: 2017-03-12 20:52:40
I am curious to see others' opinions on how this will affect the block size debate. 
On one hand, it could result in SegWit activating without the consent of the miners who provide network security, and who are the only entity who have a vested financial interest in Bitcoin. 
On the other hand, it has the potential to create a sense of urgency among the miners to consider implementing an alternate implementation of Bitcoin.

This surprises me. I would think that major businesses would have all of the various implementations of Bitcoin tested and ready that have even a small chance of getting implemented well before they would possibly get implemented so they can validate deposits and sign/broadcast withdrawals if/when it goes live.

@_date: 2017-03-20 22:11:03


My guesstimate is not very long. Miners have certain incentives not to mine on a minority chain, and they have even more incentives not to mine on a chain that is going to die off in the near future.

You are looking at the "last" price, not the high bids/low offers.

As long as the miners can communicate with each other, they will provide security to the BU blockchain, the other miners will flock to that blockchain in masse.

Right, the decision to implement a miner-led (or any for that matter) HF should be based on more than 1 days worth of data. There should be a clear majority of the miners supporting BU for an extended period of time (perhaps one difficulty cycle, but not necessarily that long).

It would be reckless to not get ready for something like SegWit when there is a real chance that it might get activated. Not being ready for SegWit would mean that the business would be unable to validate incoming transactions

@_date: 2017-03-25 05:45:23
That block was found 30 seconds after the previous block, and AntPool likely did not have sufficient time to determine which transactions not to include in a new block because they had just been confirmed. 
All of the transactions included in that block were likely not previously seen by the network.
If AntPool had not started working on this new block, then they would have created a competing block at the previous height, which would have created a block race.

This can fairly easily be faked, one user can have many nodes for very little cost. I also believe that many users do not use their own full node.

I can currently send a wire transfer for free without paying a fee with my bank, and the time from when I request the wire be sent to when the receiver acknowledges receipt of the wire is usually about 30-45 minutes if requested during banking hours. This is roughly the amount of time I would expect to wait for one confirmation due to the potential for bad "luck" among the miners during the specific period after I send a transaction. If I did not keep the balance that I keep in my bank account, then I would pay about $25 to send a wire, which is less than the amount it would take to process an on-chain transaction with LN if things keep going the way they are going. 
The effective cost (that is passed onto me from merchants I buy from) of me using a credit card is somewhere in the range of 2.5%-3.5% plus $0.20-$0.40, which Bitcoin has historically been very competitive with in the past. 
Also, it is unlikely that Bitcoin will ever scale to Visa levels, and will especially not scale to these levels within the next decade, and in the next decade, it is reasonable for technology to have improved in a way so that many more transactions can be validated and transmitted than is even imagined today.

Not true. If miners are not signaling acceptance of a SF, then there is no reason to believe they are validating the rules of a SF. Therefor if someone were to send an "anyone can spend" transaction to a miner, that is actually not an "anyone can spend" transaction, and requires a signature, then the miner would have no way to know not to include said transaction in their block.

In the 2015 tax year, I used form 8949 because the income amount was fairly large, and wanted to be able to better document my cost basis. You can freeform a description of the asset being sold, and I would not find it unreasonable for someone to describe their "bitcoin" as something other than "bitcoin". 
In years past, I had reported my bitcoin related income as hobby income, primarily because the amounts involved were much smaller. The amount of income tax owed as a result was the same as if I had used form 8949, and reporting income this way did not afford me any kind of benefit that I would not otherwise be entitled to. If the IRS were to end up not liking this, the worse case scenario would be that I would have to file an amended return with the use of different forms, but would owe no additional tax. 
I am not sure if I used the term "bitcoin" on any of my tax returns or not.

No, it wont be. Existing nodes will not relay double spend attempts.

I do know what I am talking about. 
In your example, you are correct that I do not have to use P2SH in regards to the addresses/transactions that I generate, however I will need to validate P2SH transactions once the first P2SH transaction has confirmed on the blockchain. I especially have to validate P2SH transactions that are sent from a P2SH address to me. Even if I were to decide not to validate transactions from P2SH addresses, the cost of using the blockchain will have increased because P2SH takes up additional block space then non-P2SH transactions. 
I am not forced to change my software when it comes to any HF. If I do not wish to participate in a HF, then I am free to continue using an older implementation of software.

It is really not that difficult to maintain privacy when using a SPV client because of bloom filters. 
It is similarly difficult to censor someone's transaction that is not running a full node, especially for more than a few blocks due to the large number of avenues that transactions can be broadcast.

@_date: 2017-03-23 05:27:05
There are multiple ways that transaction fees collectively can increase for the miners. 
Blocks can be kept artificially small, and the cost per transaction can increase over time, or blocks can process a higher number of transactions, each of which includes a small fee, the aggregate of which is an increase of fees. 
Most successful companies will seek to sell their products in a high volume so that their unit profit is generally small, but sell as high of a quantity of their product as possible.   
@_date: 2017-03-20 01:10:15
The nodes really do not mean anything. The major businesses all have BU nodes that will allow them to validate BU blocks, and if a user wants to be able to fully validate a transaction they receive, they can upgrade to a BU node when the fork happens. 
@_date: 2017-03-05 18:30:48
No, this is not possible. 
If you tried something like this, then a miner wanting to mine an empty block would simply include transactions he sent to himself in order to fill the block above the required minimum.
Also, the only real reason why any particular modern block is empty is because the pool is still processing which transactions need to be removed from the mempool because they were just confirmed, and if the pool were to instead continue mining on the prior block, then it would create a block race, which would result in one of the two block getting orphaned, and no additional transactions getting confirmed anyway.

He satoshi was referring to "nodes" in the part of the whitepaper that you quoted, he was referring to the miners, not someone running a full node and not mining. 
Furthermore, it is the miners who are the *only* part of the network with a vested interest in the long term heath of Bitcoin. See the relevant post that I posted [here]( as to why it is the miners who should be collectively making decisions regarding Bitcoin.

There are many major economic players who have supported and continue to support alternate implementations to CORE, as well as on-chain scaling solutions that involve a "clean" max block size increase.

The miners could potentially make a new block 457017, and subsequently build on top of it that spends the same inputs from 1GQogzZrgE4iUJ8Pu9s8CTdxSwf9KR2JBG and double spend the above transaction, and there is nothing that any of the nodes could do about it.

If polinex were to get hacked, and lose all of their BTC, and announced they were going to allow for altcoin withdrawals, but not BTC withdrawals, then they would probably get sued, and a judge would likely issue an injunction preventing withdrawals in this manor. 
IMO, more likely scenarios would be something along the following:
*Polinex gets hacked, but the amount lost is low enough for polinex to cover with their own operating funds, customers do not lose money
*Polinex gets hacked, the losses are substantial enough so that it is not reasonable for them to recover, and Polinex goes into liquidation. Customers would likely receive little to nothing due to attorney's and trustee's fees. 
*Polinex gets hacked, the losses are too high for polinex to cover but might be able to cover the losses over several months/years. Polinex would likely "freeze" the portion of customer funds that were lost (eg if the value of the stolen BTC is 20% of all customer assets, then customers would have 20% of their funds frozen). 
You can see the bitfinex hack from August 2016 for more information. 
I don't think any exchange would be able to continue operations if *all* of their BTC was stolen.

I think Satoshi was wrong on that point. As long as each implementation following the same consensus rules, there should not be any problems.

The term "malicious" is very subjective. Bitcoin core was often flagged as "malicious" by anti-virius software in Bitcoin's early-ish days. Some people consider even the option to relay RBF transaction to be malicious, yet many people are running nodes with the option to have RBF.

A fork of any kind to activate BU or SW will be contentious, this is true even if you call your fork a "soft fork".
A contentious fork that does not have the backing of the miners (I don't think the miners who are supporting SW are supporting UASF) is even more dangerous because there is the risk that Bitcoin's security will be lost as a result of this kind of fork. 
Further, UASF is going to push the miners towards BU, and will give the miners more of a deadline to activate BU by. 
The result of all this is that the risk of a 51% attack becomes the risk of a 34% attack (a much lower threshold), and there is the risk that minority chain(s) will not very quickly die off, which means the risk of wipeouts is prolonged.

Yes they do actually. A soft fork will force people onto a chain in which a specific feature is possible. A SegWit softfork will force everyone using Bitcoin onto a blockchain that uses SegWit.
OTOH, a SegWit HF will involve users who want to use this feature to upgrade, and those who do not want this feature have the option not to upgrade.

You forgot to mention that the block rewards for miners take 100 confirmations to become spendable.

There is no evidence that says this is true. Nodes can easily be faked. Services are simply getting ready because they believe that SegWit could be implemented, and want to be able to validate transactions sent to them if it is (if they are not ready they will be unable to validate transactions). Wallets....I am not even sure where to start here....again, they are getting ready so their users can validate incoming transactions if SegWit is implemented, and probably much more importantly, the fact that a wallet service offers a certain feature does not mean that the end user using said wallet actively wants this feature.

Mining equipment *must* be used for a long time in order for the owner of said equipment to have a return on their investment. While the mining equipment is being used, bitcoin must remain valuable.

Lighting is a protocol that is based on the Bitcoin protocol. If we both wanted to, you and I could open a channel that uses the Lighting protocol the day that SegWit is activated. Each of us would most likely need to generate and sign all of the relevant transactions somewhat manually though.
In the future, there will likely be software clients (similar to wallets) that will help users automatically generate and sign Lighting transactions. I have no idea when this software will be ready and available. 
I don't think that SegWit will be activated, nor do I think it should be. I believe the miners fear (rationally or not) that SegWit will pave the way for lower total mining fees in the future verses if all transactions are kept on-chain (and the max block size increased). 
I believe that SegWit should not be implemented until it is tested on an altcoin that has economic value that is a fork of Bitcoin (Litecoin comes to mind), to allow for hackers to attempt to exploit SegWit for profit, that is not possible on the testnet (because there would be no profit).

They probably actually will be. 
Bitfinex will likely eventually get these coins back, and will need to use them to repay both their BFX token holders and RRT token holders (if sufficient amounts of recovered property exist), both of which are denominated in terms of USD.
@_date: 2017-01-27 18:39:03
I am pretty sure that Bitfinex did exactly that. They lost ~36% of customer money (less what Bitfinex contributed of their own money) and returned the balance back to customers. The ~36% that was unable to be returned was credited in the form of BFX tokens, and Bitfinex is currently trying to repay BFX token holders. 
Bitfinex has also allowed customers to sell this debt if they receive an offer from someone that is high enough for the seller to agree to. No one is forced to sell their BFX token.

Here is the problem -- if someone has a 0 day exploit on SegWit, there is no guarantee that someone else has not figured out this exact same exploit. If the other person uses the exploit then it will become worthless to the person who did not use it, therefore both people have an active incentive to use any exploit they know about once SegWit starts being used on a chain with any amount of value.
@_date: 2017-01-08 23:51:05
True but SegWit is a big enough of a change that there is more serious risk of there being problems. 
There is also the fact that it would be very difficult to undue SegWit (if necessary), while it would be less difficult to undue other softforks. 
@_date: 2017-01-31 04:25:53


Immediately? No, however they often are (I presume). SegWit has been around for many months now, and has been in a state that those who do have a potential exploit have incentives *not* to use it. This means there is a larger window of time for someone to discover a 0-day-type exploit.
If you are arguing that someone with a SegWit exploit will not use this exploit on LTC, but will wait for SegWit to be rolled out on BTC, then I would say that SegWit should not be rolled out to BTC if this is the case. 
@_date: 2017-01-28 14:51:00
Bottom line is that the hacker should not be allowed to cash out his stolen coins. You can make whatever "slipper slope" argument about this that you want, however that is simply the reality. Any exchange that confiscates stolen coins from the hacker will be on the right side of the law, and any exchange that allows the hacker to freely exchange stolen coins for other forms of value will likely be liable to bitfinex for the amount of stolen coins that was deposited.

It is trivial, and instantaneous to check the source of a bitcoin payment -- this can easily be done within seconds on an automated basis from the time the transaction is broadcast to the network. 
If you were to operate under the assumption that what happened "5 transactions ago" on the blockchain has no meaning, then a criminal could simply make 5 "dummy" transactions, and be able to spend whatever stolen money they want. 
Most importantly, I think a lot of people who use bitcoin do not want to be helping fund criminal activity. When I am trading with someone, I will ask my trading partner to confirm that both the bitcoin, and whatever I am sending is not/will not be part of any criminal/illegal/immoral activity because that I not something that I want to be a part of.   
Also, this coins in question are part of what is now a hundred million dollar theft, not a $20 illegal drug sale. I think this is a very important distinction.

Not necessarily. If that block was under the 1 MB current max blocksize limit, then the hash of the block would have been different and may not have been valid. 
@_date: 2017-01-17 00:18:14
Maybe both the pro-SegWit and anti-SegWit groups are investing in additional mining capacity to be able to move the SegWit vote in their favor. 
Another possibility is that the hashrate has generally trailed the price as more miners are brought online as the value of the total block reward increases.

You are not going to be able to use PayPal -- either you are a scammer, or the person who is willing to accept PayPal from you is a scammer, or possibly you will pay a very high premium for using PayPal. 
If you are going to send a wire, I would suggest using gemini as this will likely result in the lowest total costs for you (out of trading fees, incoming wire fees -- or a lack thereof for gemini -- and slippage), unless you are planning on buying 200+ (or so) BTC, in which case GDAX/Coinbase would probably be cheaper due to slippage on gemini.

Merchants accept checks, and credit cards all the time and do not force customers to wait in line for days/months for transactions to 'clear'. Merchants can take fraud prevention measures like recording ID information from customers when they accept a 0/unconfirmed transaction. There is also little reason why a customer cannot send $100 worth of bitcoin to BestBuy when they arrive at the store (if they are planning on spending roughly $100), have the transaction confirm while they are shopping, then send an additional $15 when they end up spending more then anticipated ($15 worth of risk on a $115 transaction is low for the merchant), or BestBuy can refund $10 to the customer if they end up spending less then anticipated (there would be no reason to wait for a confirmation).
All of the costs associated with confirming a transaction are in terms of the size of the transaction. A 300 byte transaction that sends $100,000 costs the same to the miners that a 300 byte transaction that sends $10. With each additional byte worth of transactions that a block includes increases the chances that a block will get orphaned and if the miner is not sufficiently compensated for this risk, then the miner will not include the additional transaction in their block.

I don't think a mixer will accept the stolen bitfinex coins because if they do then their customer will complain when they are unable to exchange that stolen coin for fiat because the exchange they sent it to froze their account, and also because if a mixer accepts a stolen bitfinex coin, then many people will be looking very closely at the mixer's coin, deanonymizing the rest of their customers, both of which would be negative for their business. 
Also if the hacker were to gain "clean" BTC for their stolen coins 1 BTC per day, then it would take them over 300 years to get all of their stolen coins "cleaned"

I personally think that it would be best to have SegWit tested on Litecoin, or some other fork of Bitcoin that has "real" value before implementing it on the Bitcoin Mainnet. 
Doing this will give people monitory incentives to find ways to exploit/break SegWit (if such ways exist) without risking the Bitcoin network.
I would note that SegWit is a fairly large change to Bitcoin. I would also note that the "flaw" that allowed millions of dollars to be stolen from the DAO existed for a decent amount of time before someone actually exploited this flaw.

The fees will be lower for the miners then otherwise. 
The miners could benefit from micro-transactions by having them be on-chain transactions and collect a lower amount on a per-transaction basis.

If you use coinbase vault, you should have access to two of the three keys necessary to spend your funds. It is my understanding that coinbase will only spend funds after 48 hours, but you can simply sign a transaction spending your funds immidiately.

Mining is already largely centralized, and I do not see mining becoming more centralized with larger blocks. If a pool were to start to "misbehave" by acting somehow unethically, then the owners of mining equipment will move their equipment to other pools (and/or form new pools) -- just look at what happened with GHash not long after evidence was discovered that they were confirming double spend  transactions that harmed various on-chain gambling sites. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 20:02:48
The miners have invested millions of dollars on their mining equipment and if LN takes fees from the miners then the miners will lose money on their investment.
The same entities that have invested in the miners may also invest in LN nodes, however they will still lose out in their investments in mining equipment, and will almost certainly have less overall profits.

Your oversimplified comparison leaves out one very important detail(among others):
SegWit paves the way for LN down the road. LN will move both transactions and transaction fees off-chain to LN hubs, and away from miners. By the miners agreeing to SegWit today, they are agreeing to allow their income to go to LN hubs and away from their wallets.

If a channel is attempted to be closed, but cannot be entirely closed due to a parent transaction having it's txid changed, then one party could be blackmailed into receiving a lesser amount of BTC then what they are otherwise entitled to. Multisig (2 of 2) prevents one party from outright stealing funds, it does not force either party into signing transactions.

If I had known that you were considering to resign from bitfinex, I would have told you to ignore the trolls, and that your best course of action would be to not respond to them. I personally think that most of the anti-bitfinex trolls are either associated with competitor(s) of bitfinex, would otherwise benefit if bitfinex were to not be successful (eg. are short BFX), lost money on a leveraged trade when bitfinex got hacked (eg. had a long futures position on OkCoin, and was force liquidated), or something similar.

There have not been any economic incentives to try to "break" and/or "hack" SegWit due to the fact that SegWit has been tested exclusively on a zero value testnet. 
If SegWit is first implemented on Litecoin, then someone could try to steal litecoins from users, trick users into thinking they have received LTC when they have not, among other things. These kinds of incentives will allow a greater number of people to "test" SegWit

RBF is essentially a double spend, and allowing for RBF would essentially break the long standing notion that a second transaction that conflicts with a first transaction will be rejects by nodes and will not propagate. 
Multiple pools could implement the kind of service that I proposed, and would only deduct a user's account if their pool confirmed their transaction, allowing for a user to increase the tx fee for a particular transaction across multiple pools/the majority of the network. My proposal is very similar to CPFP on a user-experience basis, however it does not take up the extra blockspace that CPFP takes up.

Full nodes would not be impossible to maintain, they would however be more expensive to maintain verses if the maximum block size were to remain at 1 MB. This does not necessarily mean that the cost of running a full node will increase -- the cost of storage and bandwidth (the two primary costs associated with running a full node) will likely decline over time as technologies improve, for example, the cost of running a full node today with a hypothetical 4 MB maximum block size would likely be less then the cost of running a full node in 2012, when the maximum block size was 1 MB.  
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:11:46
No, not really. Miners could implement a policy to only accept transactions that their node would otherwise relay.

It sounds like ViaBTC is allowing a certain number of lower-fee-then-otherwise transactions to get confirmed in their blocks if users "ask nicely" aka visit their website to submit their transactions. 
One thing that I would like to see is something along the lines of a pool allowing a user to deposit a certain amount of BTC to a pool "account" then when they have a transaction that paid too little of a transaction fee, they can tell the pool to deduct "x" BTC from their "account" and treat the transaction as if it included "x" BTC plus the actual tx fee attached in order to get it quickly confirmed.  
@_date: 2016-12-04 19:12:24


It is closer to a private CPFP service.

I think you should consider reading the LN whitepaper. 
Two transactions are signed when a LN channel is opened, but only one is broadcast. If the first transaction has it's txid changed, then the 2nd (closing) transaction is invalidated and no transaction exists that can close a LN channel. 
@_date: 2016-11-27 22:58:24




It is my understanding that LN will not be possible without SegWit (or something else that removes malleability). 
With high s-value (?) transactions becoming non-standard, malleability has for the most part been resolved.....unless of course you want to implement something like LN.
Regarding "LN hubs", there needs to be some counterparty for each LN payment channel, and this entity will obviously want to take some kind of fee for their services, otherwise they would not participate.  
@_date: 2016-12-04 04:11:11
If you load your own coins then the person you are selling the coins to needs to trust you (aka the creator of the coins). I am not entirely sure how 2 of 2 multisig physical coins are suppose to work, however there will be trust involved on the side of the receiver in every potential scenario.
I am not familiar with open dime coins, however you will need to trust that the person selling you the coin is not selling a fake (knowingly or unknowingly) that is able to be passed off as legit after being plugged in
@_date: 2016-11-27 23:08:06
They might make more transaction fees when compared to today, however the LN network will take transaction fees from LN transactions. Some of these fees might eventually go the miners, however the LN network as a whole must earn a profit, otherwise the entities that are facilitating LN transactions have zero motivation of doing so. 
@_date: 2016-12-05 07:01:33
I would think using CPFP with multiple transactions would reduce privacy (which I understand that your service is generally fairly good at maintaining, verses other casinos)

CPFP uses up additional block space. If you were to work out the deals you described above with several/all of the major mining pools(whoever mines the block that confirms your transaction would receive the additional fee), then your transactions would be very similar to CPFP but without the blockchain bloat.

How can LN users be confident that channels will be closed if they do not know with certainty that parent transactions will have a specific txid without the potential for malleability being removed?




Most businesses do not send transactions that are dependent on an unconfirmed transaction -- I cannot remember the last time I received a withdrawal from a service whose parent transaction(s) did not have at least one confirmation, and every time I have deposited BTC to any website/exchange, my deposit transaction always had at least one confirmation before my deposit was used in a child transaction (to process another withdrawal, move to cold storage, ect.). 




I think I would need to re-read the LN whitepaper to discuss this with more confidence, however absent LN fees, I don't think there are any incentives for someone to send money to a third party on behalf of someone else.

You can click on the link on my above post to see the tweet.
If one person owns all those machines, then it would make sense for there to be a single point of failure across all those miners.
The owner of that mining equipment probably had a single SSH (or a collection of SSH keys all saved in one location) that was compromised, and a hacker used that key to access all the mining equipment.
It is basically the same thing as if someone had a lot of bitcoin stored in a single bitcoin address -- if the private key to that bitcoin address is compromised, the hacker is going to be able to steal all of the bitcoin within that bitcoin address.

In order to make that trade, you will have to:
0 - have $100,000 to start
1 - trust the exchange with that much BTC
2 - be able to open your position in a way so that the market does not fall too much (otherwise the trade will be less/not profitable)
3 - not get margin called prior to pulling off the attack
4 - know how much the price of BTC will fall, if it falls 25% but you think it will fall 30%, then it will be much more difficult to exit your position
5 - be able to maintain control over the miners for long enough so that the price will fall, otherwise you will be position in which you will lose your entire investment. 
6 - make sure the exchange you are trading on does not go insolvent as a result of your 51% attack
Not an easy feat. 
@_date: 2017-04-08 17:57:53
I don't think many miners will be willing to do this. If they did, then you could easily perform double spend attacks against businesses, and when that business finds out that the particular pool is confirming these double spend transactions, the pool's reputation will be harmed.

As have I, and neither do I (I had "lost" a fairly decent amount of USD as a result of the August hack). I actually made a decent amount of USD buying up BFX tokens cheaply when they were trading at .34, .45, and .58 on the dollar. A point that I would make is that, Bitfinex would have simply increased the loss percentage imposed on their customers if there were any existing solvency issues.
There seem to be a number of trolls on reddit that are spending a large amount of time implying that Bitfinex is insolvant and having problems that far exceed their actual problems. I suspect these people (or more likely person with multiple accounts) are that of a competitor of Bitfinex.

Short terms changes in market prices are largely noise.

I disagree this is something that needs to be fixed.

He has also been accused of [vandalizing]( Wikipedia pages by his peers at Wikipedia in 2006. 
I also get the feeling that his interactions with the community make the community more polarized, which is a bad thing, even if there are technical merits behind his proposals.

IIRC, ghash.io had &gt;50% of the network hashrate for a short period of time and the market did not crash, although they did not do anything to actively attack the network AFAIK. 
Based on how long the viabtc and antpool hashrate was lower than it was yesterday, it looks like control over the mining equipment was only lost for around 4 hours or so. I am not sure that a 51% attack that lasts ~4 hours (likely less) would be sufficient to tank the market as it may take some time to figure out what is happening and for news to spread. Also, shorting the market would require an additional investment by the hacker, which they may or may not have.
Also, as an FYI, if someone were to make 100,000BTC shorting on OkCoin.com (the only market that has anywhere near sufficient liquidity to make anywhere near this much), you would need to wipe out nearly all the equity in nearly all of their customers' accounts.

If we can't agree on SegWit, then what is the point in changing the PoW, which is only one reason why SW has not been implemented yet?
Also, in addition to what u/Rrdro said below, changing the PoW (unless the PoW has explicitly been broken, or is explicitly nearly broken) is going to cause long term harm on the security of Bitcoin because manufacturers of mining equipment will be hesitant to invest in R&amp;D to invent efficient mining hardware, which will make it less expensive for an adversary to requisite (either via inventing the hardware himself, or via purchasing it on the market) the necessary hardware to successfully attack the network.

There are no rules about what owners of mining equipment can and cannot do with their equipment. 
Bitcoin (and by extension Litecoin)'s PoW is secure based on the sound assumption that those performing the PoW will act in their own long term economic best interests. 
In response to your gun analogy, society has developed procedures on how to decide what is right and wrong (what is illegal), and how wrong things are (what the punishment for breaking the law is), with minority opinions being protected (via the requirement of supermajorities, often 2/3 or 3/4, or somewhere else in that approximate range), and those who make these decisions (those who enact laws) are held accountable (via regular elections) if they do not act in line with their constituents. Through these procedures, society has decided that it is wrong to do certain acts with a gun that you own.
If you apply the above to SegWit and other scaling solutions, you will see that Bitmain is within their rights to engage in this kind of activity. Those in control of media channels and of what gets put into the reference client have demanded near-unanimous consent in order to even start the discussion of making changes -- this is not protecting the minority opinion, this is giving the very small minority control via it's veto power. The community, nor the economy elected the current dev team, nor are they held accountable for their decisions (or lack thereof). Further, there is far from a supermajority of users/the economy who actively want SegWit, there is a small minority of users/the economy who actively want SegWit to be implemented, and many others are ready for SegWit.
I would also point out that nearly all banks (and their trade associations) have been against the CFPB, and many of the regulations they imposed. This does not mean however that these banks did not get ready for the regulations once they became aware they had the potential to get implemented.

If an old node thinks an input is 'anyone-can spend' then it is not validating anything. There is nothing to stop someone from broadcasting a transaction with no signature from an address they have nothing to do with. An attacker could look at the blockchain and find inputs that are unlikely to get spent in the near future.

If you were to utilize this technology in the US (that has strong IP laws) with mining equipment that you manufactured yourself (via your company), and you use this mining equipment solely on your own farm, then the patent holder would likely never know you infringed on your patent (how would they?). 
@_date: 2017-04-10 03:03:04
If you invest somewhere in the range of 3-4 figures USD worth of mining equipment, then you should be able to turn a profit mining, although if you invest substantially more, your profit margins will probably increase a little bit due to economies of scale (economies of scale apply to almost every industry). There has been more talk of changing the PoW recently, so some people may be hesitant to invest large sums of money into mining equipment out of fear that their equipment will become worthless before their investment is recouped.
Depending on the specifics of your situation, if your purchased early ASICs, then there is a decent chance that you were able to profit handsomely even if they were mining virtually nothing in less than a year.
It is not possible to "gradually" change the PoW.

Well I don't think it is possible to have an algo that **truly** is ASIC-proof. 
The point I was making a couple of posts above is that if/when the PoW is changed, then there are disincentives for economically rational entities to invest in ASICs and invest R&amp;D dollars into ASIC technology. The reason for this is because investors need to account for the risk that their ASIC mining equipment (and/or ASIC technology) will become worthless when (once the PoW is changed once, it is no longer a question "if" the PoW will change again) the PoW changes again. 
The problem with this is that when Bitcoin is in the above described situation, an entity acting not-economically-rationally would need to spend a lesser amount to purchase sufficient mining equipment to act maliciously towards the network. One might say that if/when this happens, the PoW can simply be changed again, however when the PoW is subsequently changed, there will be even greater disincentives to invest in mining equipment, and the cost to attack the network will decrease even further.

I would dispute that Bitmain makes 90% of the miners today, however the reason why they have such a large market share is because of their ability to innovate. It is unlikely that Bitmain would outright stop making new mining equipment, however if they did then others would step in and take advantage of the profit opportunities. 
I am not aware of any **unfair** advantages that Bitmain holds. Who gave them these **unfair** advantages?

No, please do not do this! VMs are horribly bad at generating random numbers, so if you generate any private keys on a VM, you will be at risk of a collusion. Also, anytime you sign a transaction, one part of the signature is the 'r' value, which needs to be secret, and should be random, if someone can figure out your 'r' value, then they can calculate the private keys used to sign the transaction.

You cannot tell that a miner is using ASICBOOST technology by looking at the block headers, u/nullc has posted this multiple times in this thread. Also, there is no reason why a private mining farm could not have the coinbase transaction send the coinbase reward to a fresh address in every block they find.

This is not true. AntPool mines empty blocks shortly after a previous block was found, and has not yet figured out which transactions were included in the prior block, and do not include transactions in an effort to not mine an invalid block. If they were to not engage in this activity, then they would not be able to mine on top of the newly found block and there would be many more orphan races.

I have it on fairly good authority that they are using a 4-of-7 multisig setup in which 7 team members have exactly one of the 7 keys, and also that each of the keys are stored on a trezor. 
One risk with using multiple cold storage addresses is that it is slightly more difficult to confirm that no mistakes were made in calculating the address, and there is a slightly higher chance that some of the keys required to spend funds in cold storage would get lost/destroyed. It is also slightly more difficult to confirm that accounts are in balance in real time, which might delay the stopping of deposits/withdrawals while things can be figured out if there is a problem.

I assume that you are proposing that the PoW be changed 1-2 years in the future. If we were to do that, then the current mining manufacturers would have ample time to design and manufacture new equipment, however there is no reason to believe that changing the PoW would result in different manufacturers dominating the market. In fact I would speculate that announcing today that the PoW will change in two years would result in mining manufacturing to become even more centralized than it is today because the major manufactures can afford to make large investments in technology that will have zero revenue for an extended period of time.
A PoW change that is announced two years ahead of time would not have the negative long term security implications that I described above, however Bitcoin would become less secure as we approached the changeover date.

Say for example that at minute '1' a pool receives a "secret" transaction (tx A). At minute '2' a user sends a conflicting transaction to the network (tx B) that a business receives, checks for double spend attempts, other conflicts and other criteria (such as RBF status, fee rate), and accepts the unconfirmed transaction. At minute '5' the pool finds a block and includes tx A in that block, making it impossible for tx B to ever get confirmed. If this happened frequently enough, then businesses would start to notice that this pool is confirming transactions that conflict with transactions they previously accepted. 
I would also point out that ghash was involved in these kinds of double spend transactions not long before they got 50% of the network hashrate (I am not sure if they were double spending their own transactions, or unknowingly double spending their customers' transactions), and I suspect that this had something to do with their fall from ~50% of the network to 0 today (and very negligible for a long time).

Bitfinex has certain types of orders, called 'scaled orders' that help large traders (whales) hide the true amount they are trying to trade from the rest of the market by breaking up large orders into smaller orders spread throughout the order book (at different price points). 
They currently have [roughly 121k BTC]( in cold storage, and roughly $90 million in USD deposits currently, and have a very liquid "open" order book (eg the open orders that are currently displayed). There is a lot of liquidity on Bitfinex, so large traders will naturally want to trade there, and if someone wants to trade a large amount of BTC that the order book might not be able to handle right away, they might watch the order book and place an order once someone else tries to buy/sell a large amount of BTC
I would expect the price of BTC to be higher on Bitfinex than on other exchanges currently because they have just repaid roughly $13 million worth of BFX tokens, so a lot of customers have USD in their accounts that they might want to convert into BTC and move into either a wallet they control or another exchange to convert into USD.

A couple of things:
*Many people have USD on bitfinex that they use to lend on the USD lending market, and some of these people will need this USD for one reason or another -- this will result in natural buying pressure on bitfinex
*Some people have BTC and need USD, and will sell their BTC on an exchange and withdraw their USD to their bank account -- this would normally result in selling pressure on bitfinex. This is not happening as USD withdrawals are effectively paused/suspended for the immediate future. 
*When there is a price discrepancy, traders would normally arb across various exchanges, however this is not possible because of USD withdrawal delays.

This would not be a good idea. Changing the PoW would provide disincentives to invest in mining technology (ASICs), which means that the difficulty would be lower. If the difficulty is lower, then it will be less expensive to attack the network via the miners. Also if no one/fewer people are investing in R&amp;D to develop ASICs, then someone who wishes to attack the network would only need to invest some money into R&amp;D research to develop ASICs.

We don't need anywhere near that level of capacity today. There isn't sufficient demand to fill up 2 MB blocks today, and demand for block space will not grow by 100% overnight (or anywhere near this speed). 
Having all that excess transaction capacity will accomplish nothing and will only cause the cost of using Bitcoin to increase. 
I don't think it is necessary to have the long term average actual block size to be less then 15% of the actual maximum block size, or so.

IMO the best way to solve the blocksize debate would be something along the lines of what BIP101 did, in that the maximum block size increased over time. If it is widely agreed upon that the maximum block size is increasing too quickly, then the maximum block size can effectively be lowered via soft fork(s). 
If the maximum block size is too large then the Bitcoin network will have to invest in a lot of unused capacity.

There are two root cause problems:
1 - There are a lot of services that heavily reuse addresses, meaning that "you" are probably trading with people that reuse addresses. Say for example if you deposit into your bitstamp account a transaction that contains two outputs each containing 1 BTC, it will be clear which output is the change address because blockchain analysis can be used to determine which address belongs to bitstamp. I understand that poloniex is an even worse offender as I don't believe they allow customers to change deposit addresses.
2 - Many people tend to deposit bitcoin into various services in even amounts. Assuming an exchange rate of $615.67/BTC, instead of depositing 59.9964 BTC (~$36.950) into a service, they will deposit 60 BTC. Unless the input is also an even amount, I think it will be fairly common for the address that receives a non-even amount of bitcoin when one output contains the even amount of bitcoin  to be the change address. In your "1c34bf81c115ab621cff572d55486682278bee9d7840dfec288269a318b2ee3b" example, if the 60 BTC output contained 8 digits of random amounts, then the change address would be much less obvious.
There is also the fact that change addresses can sometimes be spendlinked together. So if one of your addresses is known to belong to you, and you sign/broadcast a transaction with two outputs, one being a change address, subsequently sign a second similar transaction but none of the addresses are known to belong to you, then subsequently sign a transaction containing both of those change addresses, then it will be clear which address was the change addresses in both transactions, and the 'signing' address from the 2nd transaction will be known to belong to you.

If SW were to get implemented and then un-implemented, then any BTC sent to a SW address that is unspent as of when SW gets un-implemented would be vulnerable to theft by the miners, and any miner would be able to spend this BTC.

@_date: 2017-05-08 21:51:38
I don't think "who have actually implemented" SegWit is a good way to measure support. Anyone acting economically rationally will use SW once activated because it will result in cost savings, however this does not mean they support it (eg they actually want it). 
@_date: 2017-05-14 02:52:31
SegWit will result in a user sending BTC to a specific type of "anyone can spend" output, however SW also changes the protocol so that anyone attempting to spend the SW output must also provide a signature that is located in a different location than signatures are located with "normal" transactions currently. 
What this means is that once SW is activated, it will effectively be impossible to reverse/un-implement (even with a Hard Fork) because any money contained in a SW address will become truly "anyone can spend". So long as SW remained implemented, money in a SW address can only be spent via providing a signed transaction.

1 - I am fairly confident that you know that node numbers can easily (and cheaply) be faked. 
2 - It is my understanding that a 0.14.1 node will signal SegWit by default (I am not sure if it can even be configured to not signal SegWit), and users are told they need to upgrade via multiple, high visibility channels, so the BIP141 ready nodes are more nodes that are simply using the most recent software. 
3 - One could argue that whatever teh 15.1% of nodes reflected in your graph represent (it looks like they are nodes that are not signaling SegWit, nor BIP148) are actively against SW, and one might be able to infer that a large percentage of these nodes would be opposed to a HF whose purpose is to allow SW to get activated.

In order for this to be profitable, an attacker would need to be able to successfully withdraw over 21k BTC in under 10 minutes, assuming a total block reward of 12.5 BTC (which is really unrealistically low). I am not aware of any Bitcoin services that allow a 20k BTC withdrawal within 10 minutes. I am not aware of any Bitcoin services that allow a 2k BTC withdrawal in under 10 minutes. There are very few Bitcoin services that allow a 200 BTC withdrawal in under 10 minutes. 
Even if you were able to get a Bitcoin service (or a collection of services to collectively) to allow a 20k withdrawal in under 10 minutes, then there is a very high chance that the withdrawal will be dependent on the deposit transaction, preventing this kind of attack to be profitable/successful.

When a block is found, and broadcast to the network, any transaction included in that block is said to have 1 confirmation. If a block gets orphaned, transactions could go from having 1 confirmation to having 0 confirmations, and it is possible that some of the transactions included in a particular block will never confirm.
When a block is built on top of another block, the first block is said to have one confirmation. When a chain of two blocks is orphaned, then the first block will go from having 1 to 0 confirmations, will likely never have any confirmations, and the transactions included in the first block will potentially go from having two confirmations to having either 1 or 0 confirmations.
There are many major businesses that accept 1 confirmation payments, so it is not accurate to say that the orphaned blocks were never trusted because many businesses trusted the blocks when they accepted payments from their customers. 
@_date: 2016-07-24 01:48:43
What you say is true. However no one is forced to accept any forked, nor any "original version" coin. If you are a large business that accepts crypto coins as payment, you can choose to accept a forked version of a coin if you feel that such version has value. 
The fact of the matter is, that the overwhelming majority of the ETH economy (that is the businesses that accept ETH as payment/deposit) as payment and has decided to not accept the "original" ETH as payment/deposit. 
Accepting or not accepting a coin on a given chain/branch is one freedom that everyone has. When making the decision to accept or to not accept a coin, said person can weight the risks and benefits of accepting any given coin. 
One very important thing to consider when discussing the merits of the ETH fork is that it can be proven that the *only* person affected by the HF is the person who clearly exploited what was reasonably an unintended bug in the ETH/DAO code. Also, the amount of money involved was very large, making up a significant portion of the ETH market cap.

Both bitfinex and bitstamp have had over 100% of the BTC in their hot wallet stolen in the past (they had all the funds held in their hot wallet stolen, and covered customer losses when they continued to deposit BTC even though customers were told not to), and were able to cover these losses without any issues. I believe these losses amounted to roughly 3% of bitcoin held by each of the exchanges.
The current value of ETC is roughly 13% of ETH. If you were to assume that coinbase has the same percentage of ETH in existence as they do of BTC in existence, then ETH holdings would be valued at roughly 10% of their BTC holdings. This puts the maximum theoretical liability at ~1.3% of their BTC holdings, or less then half that other exchanges suffered without issue.
However even this ratio is unrealistically high because coinbase is a very new ETH exchange, so coinbase's ETH holdings is likely to be less then 10% of the value of their BTC holdings. Some of the ETH withdrawals that coinbase is processing presumably are to customers who they owe ETC to, and the solution to the relay attacks of these withdrawals is to simply not give these customers double credit. Additionally, coinbase is likely receiving some ETH deposits that did not also receive a corresponding amount of ETC, so coinbase could simply use those specific inputs to process some of their withdrawals. 
I think that coinbase might lose some money over this issue, however I think that this can probably be filed in the category of FUD.

SPV is perfectly safe for receiving funds, especially if you have already sent property prior to receiving BTC (why would someone send you a fake transaction when they can simply send you nothing?).
Even if you are not sending property prior to receiving BTC, then provided that you wait for at least one confirmation, then most SPV clients are generally safe to use. 
I am not aware of any examples of people loosing BTC because they accepted a fake transaction that they thought has at least one confirmation, was not the result of an orphaned block (which a full node cannot protect you against), AND the BTC receiver sent property after they thought they received BTC.
@_date: 2017-07-04 15:51:11
I think you actually have it backwards. Schnorr signatures will make (alleged) spam attacks cheaper. 
A spammer could create a transaction with one input and many outputs; today it may be uneconomical to combine those many outputs (which would be many inputs in a subsequent transaction) into a single output because fees would eat up &gt;100% of the transaction monetary size, and thus would never get confirmed, however Schnorr signatures would cause the tx fees to be sufficiently low enough so that this kind of transaction would get confirmed.
Transaction fees are ultimately determined by how much block space they take up.

Normally, if your private key were to leak immidiately after a transaction that spends all of your BTC in a particular address is sufficiently propagated throughout the network, then there would be nothing that an attacker could do to steal your money.
For example, if you were to broadcast a transaction that spends all 1 BTC contained in address A to address B, used a fee that would result in your transaction confirming in approximately 6 blocks, and subsequently published your private key, then, as a general rule, no one would be able to double spend your transaction spending the same input to an address an attacker controls. 
However with RBF, if you were to broadcast a RBF transaction with a fee that is estimated to get your transaction confirmed within 6 blocks,  and your private key is leaked after 3 blocks, then an attacker could simply broadcast a replacement transaction that would get the transaction confirmed within 1 block to an address they control.

The prudent way to backup your keys is to keep copies of your keys stored across at least two different mediums, and I am not sure that your phone would qualify as a different medium.
I don't think multisig is even necessary in this case as you could simply have your seed be stored in your phone to spend your money. The only real reason why you would want to have a 1-of-2 multisig is if you had two separate signers and needed to keep track of who spent what money.

Both the "r value" (the random number) and the private key are private. 
The "ELI5" version of the formula of the signature on a signed transaction is "[private key] * [r] = [signature]".
The [signature] is public, and if [r] can be easily guessed then an attacker only needs to "solve for x" to figure out your private key. 
As long as you spend all of the bitcoin "in" an address that you are using, then if you use a weak (in terms of randomness) "r value" then an attacker will only have ~5 minutes (on average) to determine that a weak "r value" was used, to calculate the private key and try to double spend your transaction with a higher fee. Traditionally, even if someone was able to figure out your private key this way, they would not be able to steal any money under the long standing notion that miners/nodes would not accept a conflicting transaction for ~24 hours even if the first transaction had not yet confirmed.

The thing is that after Mike Hern rage-quit, there was a lot of momentum for the calls of increasing the maximum block size, even if this meant doing so with the risks of a contentious HF, specifically without the agreement of the core devs (who really are the only ones who has ever been opposed to increasing the maximum block size) 
What is now apparent to me, the reason behind the HK agreement was to throw cold water on the movement of increasing the maximum block size. The blockstream representatives wanted to delay major economic bitcoin players from implementing bitcoin classic as long as possible, and the HK agreement contractually obligated many major bitcoin economic players from running classic until a time when Mike Hern's arguments would be long forgotten. 
It was no accident that only a small number of the core devs signed the HK agreement (as "individuals"), and it was no accident that there were multiple deadlines, the first of which could be explained away. 
I don't think there was ever any kind of intention of putting a HF into core that increases the maximum block size, I don't think any real amount of work has been put into the code of increasing the maximum block size, and I don't think the deadline of implementing SegWit was ever thought to be realistic.

There is even precedent for changing the blockchain in a way that is similar to what happened with ETH in Bitcoin, although in Bitcoin's case the change was implemented much more quickly then the ETH HF. Someone discovered a bug that allowed them to create billions of bitcoin out of thin air, satoshi noticed this, patched the bug via a HF, and the network forked as of immidiately prior to when the attacker exploited this bug. Anyone who had a transaction confirmed after the bug was implemented but before the network forked had their transaction reversed, although it was possible to have the transaction re-confirmed on the new chain.

Even if the protocol allowed for unlimited sized blocks, miners would not produce block sizes without bound. If a miner receives a new block from another miner, he will continue working on the prior block until he believes the new block is valid -- if it takes the miner too long to believe the new block is valid, he may find a conflicting block and broadcast said block. So with an "unlimited" block size, miners will still have costs associated with including an additional block.

Everything is kinda extreme don't you think? It should be trivial for them to hedge their risk by purchasing ETC in amounts that they leak on an exchange.

I am not sure what you are talking about. The majority of the economy is in favor of a larger maximum block size, the majority of users is similarly in favor of larger blocks. 
It is only a very small minority who just happens to control the media that want to have smaller blocks.

You are asking how to get $10 for free every week? 
There is obviously no "real" answer as it is impossible to receive anything of value in exchange for no work.

Like I said, you should not download this unless you have the technical ability to check for malware. 
You do realize that the OP literally created a reddit account to make this post right?

None of their opinions matter in the block size debate. 
Unless you are a major business who transacts in large amounts of bitcoin on a regular basis, you opinion and arguments might be listed to, but if you do not agree with a proposal that is about to get implemented, then there is nothing you can do to prevent such proposal from getting implemented. 
Using the above criteria for determining who is for and who is against raising the maximum block size, my quoted statement is true.

I actually believe that if you try to broadcast a transaction with an output to an invalid address, other nodes will not relay the tx, and if it somehow got to a pool, it would not confirm.

Your full node will reduce your privacy (because it will be impossible to hide the fact that you are using Bitcoin), and will take up a large amount of resources unnecessarily.
A SPV node will only provide incrementally less ability to "test" for "real" Bitcoin, and will only lack protect in very specific types of attacks.

None of that matters. Accounts can be purchased, names can be used and created to match what you want them to match.
Check for malware yourself, then run what you want to run.

When you buy BTC on the Coinbase platform, you are essentially placing a market order on the GDAX platform for the amount you are buying. If you are buying a lot of BTC, then your order may result in having to fill existing orders at above the "last" price. You will probably notice that the larger your order that the higher your price will be. 
If you have the ability to use the GDAX platform, you can place a limit order, however it will probably not fill right away if the limit price is the "last" price, and is for the same amount as in your example.

They actually will sell you BTC that is offered for sale on GDAX. When you buy BTC you are not buying directly from coinbase.

Sending fiat to bitfinex in order to purchase bitcoin. A bitcoin seller sending BTC to LocalBitcoins, a buyer sending fiat to the seller, then receiving BTC from LocalBitcoins. Selling mining equipment to a very high reputation buyer (like OgNasty or Blazed -- on bitcointalk). 


No I did not, I assumed that you were implying a very broad definition of "high risk" based on the venue you chose to post this on. I think very few people who regularly read reddit (and get their information from reddit) are receiving "high risk" transactions.

Many Uber/Lyft drivers already accept bitcoin tips. They tend to have a QR code on the back of the front seat with a note that says they accept bitcoin tips to that address.

I guess you are right if you want to cherry pick when something is and is not a "bug"

Bitfinex is, in my opinion, by far the best Bitcoin exchange. They are the most liquid exchange (they have the deepest order book), so you know that you are not going to have to pay a disadvantaged price simply because someone is trading a large position around the same time you are trying  to trade. Bitfinex also offers the ability to to lend both your BTC and USD (and ETH) which allows you to earn a little bit of income on your positions. Unfortunately it is a little expensive to deposit/withdraw fiat to/from your bank account as the fee for both depositing and withdrawing is 0.1% via bank wire (the cost via tether is free, however tether will charge you 0.1% to withdraw from tether to your bank, so the cost is still there).
