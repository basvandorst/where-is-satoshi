Don't worry it's never too late to get into bitcoin, also for investment purposes. If you want to learn more about bitcoin there's nowhere better to start than  watch the video, read around and if in your city they are doing bitcoin meetups, go! However, if you want to make some bitcoin, you are going to need to start a wallet, and if you really cannot afford some, there are plenty of faucets online that will pay you small amount, it won't be much but at least you won't have zero BTC.

Yeah, quite a few of them either do not have a claim button, are dried out, or are very tricky. Just do the top paying ones at least over 1k satoshi. I do not know its age.

Oops, my bad, corrected it ;)

I am probably late on commenting this, but i believe that if your average is 350 satoshi per faucet: you are using the wrong faucets. Take a look here, this is the address of a friend of mine who does this kind of thing:
I also do not think you are supposed to stay 3 hours straight on faucets, just do the top paying ones each day is not something to become crazy over.

Happy christmas to you too. Nice to know there is a bitcoin santa :D
I believe my favorite moment in 2015 was seeing the big dedication of the community during black friday. I also hope to see fees not rise for sending and receiving bitcoins.

here, use this list:

Sort of: it's mainly on the internet but you can also put them on a piece of paper somehow and retrieve them by taking a picture of a qr code on it.

Loool, no government or entity can entirely control the market, the Chinese included

That is the market depth. It basically shows you how much bitcoins need to be bought or sold for the price to reach a certain point. They have that shape because there are many buy and sell offers at many prices. The higher the price, the more sellers there will be because they'd rather sell them at a higher price, so that chart shows you a cumulative value of how much needs to be bought. For example, referring to that picture you linked, if someone (or several people) bought ~14 bitcoins at market price, then they'd be able to raise the price to 965.30 unless new offers come live on the market. The same thing works the other way around for sellers pushing the price down.

You are correct. If I were to purchase, saw, 30 btc at market price at the time of that chart, my purchase would be composed of many purchases starting from the bottom, so it would be of 1 btc at 964.24, 0.07 btc at 964.57, 0.08 btc at 964.97 and so on until it reaches 30 bitcoins, then the market price becomes when I have accumulated 30 coins this way. The very last seller from whom I buy bitcoins from may have a partial sale though, meaning that if he were the guy selling 15 btc at 966.60 (on your photo), and my order is missing, say, 1 btc, then his offer would become of only 14 coins and the market price would become 966.60

Today with green address I've had the login issue too, it's the kind of thing that you can simply wait out. Still sucks that this happens though.

Now that I think about it, if I made underwear branded as 'satoshi nakamoto' would the ladies fall for it and think it's me?

Sharia law is not bitcoin compliant :P

Quite nice, but there is a rule thats forbids candidates from accept donations from foreigners, won't this make that rule easier to break?

one thing is for sure: we definitely all want it to, if not higher :P

Interesting, inspired me to start an excel table myself. You should make this available in a few months after volume stabilizes. What time of the day are you using as reference for the price?
@_date: 2015-11-27 03:51:36
Omg! Exactly what i visualized :D
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:15:24
Isn't there a threshold after which you have to pay taxes?
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:04:49
I am afraid you'll just have to get them the hard way. Maybe you could use the midnight prices (since the bitcoin markets NEVER closes). 
@_date: 2015-11-26 18:46:33
nfc payment with bitcoin in stores similar to mastercard paypass. I know it may not sound very safe, but with the appropriate hardware, applications and people it could turn out to be something nice.
