that's a strong sign tbat something is going on. It starts like that. Several thefts with banks happened like that.
Change passwords ASAP esp. those that work in combination with your phone and make sure to disable your phone as the 2nd factor.
Hope all goes well.
edit: 2FA using apps is more secure. NIST recently issued a statement saying that SMSs are not safe. Yes, it's really easy to takeover your phone number. Sometimes it just takes a visit to a store to get a copy of your SIM card.

@_date: 2016-08-05 12:37:28
thanks for the info.
while it wont help much with recovering the stolen coins, it does help for the future to understand the culture of bitfinex.
not surprinsigly, there seems to be a lot more to it than just a security breach. Sloppiness and lack of structure is an invitation for what happened.
Hope Bitfinex can answer all this.
(and then bitgo's role in all this still needs to be completely understood)
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:12:08
note: i dont agree with the post but this is definitely something worth discussing - hence the upvote.
It would not work for several reasons. In fact, this idea of "bribing miners" coming from a core dev is just something i wish it never happened. It's fixing a hack with a hack. Dont know what's worst.
Coming up with a kind of a two-branch blockchain to implement cold/hot wallets means complexity that sooner or later will be exploited just like with ethereum.
Keeping the blockchain simple and making changes as minimal as possible at a time is the best starting point for security and bitcoin has proven that beyond any doubt.
(no, not getting anywhere near any block size discussion -- keep me out of that)
There is nothing wrong and flawed with Bitcoin itself.
The bitfinex hack was just that: a problem with how two private businesses implemented security when 70m was at stake and so many people trusted them with all those fancy statements that turned out to be thin air.
@_date: 2016-08-10 08:08:37
they start with the right foot: "Bitcoin, the preferred currency of both the nerd you cheated off in ninth grade and his crystal meth dealer, is one of those technologies that just won’t go away."
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:22:29
bitstamp uses bitgo as a hot wallet and keeps it under 2%
No reason to believe otherwise and this sounds good to me. Bitfinex had everything on bitgo and that ultimately was the problem.
@_date: 2016-08-04 19:51:14
what do you mean hy bitgo renoving all insurance info? do you have a link?
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:16:33
sorry but this is nothing but speculation on  how bitstamp and bitfinex are run. Nothing there even credibly hints at any problems. Fells more like a rambling without any facts.
fact is 2y later bitstamp is up and bitfinex went belly up so his major prediction was wrong
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:46:10
i really hope bitfinex writes a detailed post mortem analysis of the incident soon.
Now that it happened, the best way to recover and earn good reputation and trust is to show (1) they understand what happened, (2) they learned lessons and hardened their processes so they will never be compromised the same way (3) and share those lessons for the benefit of the community as a whole.
I hope they follow the shapeshift example.
And the same goes for bitgo. Maybe i missed it but i still didnt see any decent statement from their side.
@_date: 2016-08-20 14:18:34
that's a good question in fact and i think most answers below miss the point. Devs can change the code and github admins can change the code (anything preventing this?) Just because it's open source, it does not mean people are downloading and using what Devs meant. As you said, 99% will not review the code so open source only makes it more prone to malicious modification.
What open source does do is, if everybody is/was running compromised source, it will sooner or later be spotted by someone that will take the time to look at it line by line. 
and so far so good. By design or implementation, so far Bitcoin passed all tests and no fundamental flaw is known or, at least, that we dont know of.
@_date: 2016-08-06 13:37:02
worst than that: who is this "bitcoin staff" that is reachable and promises it is secure?
the article makes little sense on a 2nd read. 
this looks like more of a scam than anything

@_date: 2016-08-22 14:35:15
as far as I know, no report has been issued besides they promising they have learned the lessons and moving the coins back to cold storage. Reason is, IIRC, they are still investigating. On top of that, 1 week after there was this interview with someone (link somewhere on this sub) where they said they had made significant changes incl. a revamp of their platform - yes, in 1 week.
Biggest part for me is Bitgo's role.
Meaning: they learned nothing, they keep being absolute amateurs at security and it seems they will keep the sign on their website about being the most secure exchange -- pretty much adding insult to injury.
@_date: 2016-08-25 13:38:36
Do you have an independent cybersecurity office? Of how many? and a dedicated SOC?
@_date: 2016-08-29 13:01:24
it'd make stealing coins harder so it is a good idea. Thing is, in the end, the added protection is yet another set of keys and yet another process (getting alerts). If an attack is targetted at someone, it's just as likely that the second key will get stolen with the first and the alerts wont reach the right channel.  For a 2nd key, use multisig; for a delayed release that needs an extra confirmation, maybe use a hardware walet in a remote/safe location that needs a physical button to be pressed. I think this two-factor is far more effective than a built-in mechanism that uses the same type of controls.
So I think I agree with the second guy: I am not sure it d be that effective and the added implementation complexity could open lateral problems.
@_date: 2016-08-07 17:04:13
i aporeciate the thought process but i'm not sure keeping deposits small is the trick.
i'd just be cynical enough and (1) accept i *will* lose coins and (2) i should spread the risk and keep coins in different exchanges
@_date: 2016-08-21 00:16:42
glad we agree 
@_date: 2016-08-19 10:17:39
why do you say it was an inside job? did they release anything?
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:05:42
i would not go as fas as to say bitcoin is not suitable for payments etc, but definitely it has a lot to learn from banks that have been around for centuries and know a lot about how to protect their mattresses.
Bitcoin is going through growing pains and this will not be the last one. Until then, do not keep your coins in a single place.
edit: i agree with some form of clearing houses and some sort of a clearing period but i am not sure about allowing reversing payments. You need some central governance body that has the power on undoing a transaction and the moment bitcoin gets one it loses a lot of its charm.

@_date: 2016-08-05 15:23:42
i see that as a worrying sign to be honest. But they're still investigating so hopefully it'll be explained soon.
@_date: 2016-08-08 09:01:51
to complement u/uptrenda: with the info we have available, why would this have prevented or limited the breach?

oops. turns out they did issue a statement but i cant find it on their side.
here:   
 “We have added additional platform and infrastructure security checks; regenerated all encrypted services, including wallets, security tokens, and passwords; moved funds to multisig cold storage; re-evaluated all third-party integrations; performed a comprehensive system audit in order to identify vulnerabilities and rebuilt our entire platform on new infrastructure.”
If bitfinex really did say this, it's just remarkable how much work they did in 1week. It would take me and a good team a good 6 months.
@_date: 2016-08-24 17:34:33
bitfinex and kraken are having lots of attempts to login with credentials find somewhere else from other unrelated hacks so an explanation could be you reuse usernames and passwords.
...and, as below, if no 2FA or any other means to stop activity once they break in through the first door. Deadly combination.
i am glad you didnt have anything of value there. Go change passwords everywhere asap and from a trusted device because you may have a bug in your phone or computers.
@_date: 2016-08-12 18:24:41
finally someone asks that
Until (1) they provide a detailed + responsible report of what happened, (2) provide credible statements about what they learned and will implement after the hack, and (3) what was the role of Bitgo -- really stay out it.
Getting hacked is life but not addressing it in a responsible and comprehensive way is a strong sign that they will just be hacked again. Once agqin, kudos to Bitstamp for systematically doing the right things.
Hope i didnt miss anything and sorry if I did in advance.

It solves the double-spend problem. Nobody did it until very recently and bitcoin proved it can work. Using mathematical complexity in this way is a very clever trick even if all it does is generate heat.

to complement, it is also about fast the words can be iterated. Depending on your wallet, how fast can someone try different combinations? I dont know of any way of doing this fast with ledger or tresor (never checked) but with soft wallets i think you're better off creating a new wallet

google is not quite tracking users (let's believe it) in terms of their real identity. all they want is to link online ads with in-shop buys. because physical cards are untraceable with apps (they're physical - only that - and that's why google and apple want us to use our phones for payments) they need Mastercard to correlate the two actions. Thing is a bitcoin wallet is digital and trackable and, better than that (for google), publicly readable. Physical cards, in this sense, do help privacy. bitcoin, as is, is a privacy nightmare.
hope i'm making sense :/
@_date: 2017-12-26 10:26:38
HD basically means the wallet generates new addresses often and the new addresses are related to the previous ones. It doesn't explain transactions without user intervention.
@_date: 2018-09-01 12:19:51

yep, that's a good question and hence my 2nd comment. i dont know enough about trezor to answer. the only way would be to receive the device and sw separately and the user installs it after verification. or someone everyone trusts (who?)  could assess the code.
there's other techniques that together give some assurance but no silver bullet at all that i am aware of.
@_date: 2017-03-24 20:36:20
it means that the device runs code that anyone in the world can audit. if it was a scam, someone would have spotted it. nevertheless, see my comment just above
@_date: 2017-03-08 16:16:58
it gets technically complex to go beyond smart TVs and unless the target is not careful enough.
To give an example, just a year ago they couldn't crack an iphone standing on their desks and were begging apple to help them. So take everything with a grain of salt.
Note that I am also not saying it's not doable. If a particular individual is a target they will get in some way.

@_date: 2017-03-29 17:59:35
exactly. so the idea that has been circulating that it's fair deal and business as usual for a longer chain to overtake a shorter is a bit stretched. Longer chains and hardness of verification is just one mechanism that makes bitcoin robust against *malicious* attacks. I dont think the idea was to subvert the coin and make it another coin to the tastes of whoever holds enough power to do a 51%
@_date: 2017-03-08 15:51:03
CIA wikileaks is a long shot. Yes, "them" can/did do nasty stuff but it's not just like they just push a button and have access to your email. So keep it out of the equation because it's not really like that.

@_date: 2017-08-21 14:39:53
1. L2 solutions build in top of the blockchain. you have some reading to do. :)
2. someone recently argued that 20k per node is the way forward. But how many are there now? It's a different issue (availability of miners) that will go away soon, but it is a good example.
3. if it's so fast, why is it that with just with 1Mb blocks miners mine empty blocks? google it up. But, hey, i'll give 1btc if you send me a video.of a download in 2s of a 1Mb file. 
hint-just to get TCP up to a few Mbps takes seconds. If.you're technically minded, google up articles on issues with TCP with satellites and very broad links. You'll be amazed.
4. nodes are not as important as miners as long there's plenty of them. - say hundreds spread across the globe. Their role is not to validate transactions in real time. We should praise the fact that they can be run out of a raspberry pi and a sd card. More googling for you.
(over and out - cheers for the discussion)
@_date: 2017-08-21 11:35:31
there's a major thread today on that. Maybe it's worth checking it. Still, quick answers:
1. segwit does not add a "tiny bit". It nearly doubles capacity which solves scalling problems immediately. This is not the main point of segwit but it certainly comes handy.
2. No matter the rethoric, larger and larger blocks will never ever be able to cope with Visa-volumes. Fiber speeds are stalling and in a few years  syncing, say, 1TB of transactions every 10min is madness. SegWit enables hierachical growth (log) and this has been, throughout the history of any technology, the only robust way of scaling anything
3. verifying transactions is a good point but i dont think it is that relevant. Do you verify transactions with fiat?
hope it helps
and more than happy to be challenged
edit on specifically segwit2x - but i also think that going back to the drama of the last months for a ridiculous 2Mb blocks increase is really unnecessary and undesirable. There's far more important things to do than this.

you're missing context. Of course the soul of the blockchain is to verify who owns how many btcs. The context of my answer is the relevance of the witness block. I'd rather have it on chain - we agree - but i'm equally happy to let it go in exchange for what it provides.
About the rest, happy to know we agree :)
@_date: 2017-08-17 09:33:56
excellent point :D
@_date: 2017-08-21 13:16:34
1. with L2 solution, block size does not matter. There's even people already asking for smaller blocks. Because it will no really matter. That's the beauty.
2. Miner aggregation is healthy as it brings efficiency. Thing is it is healty to a certain point. If the entrance level to the market is so high you end up with 3 worldwide, bitcoin is dead. Ever heard of the cartel concept? Even worse, state funded cartels? Soon they will ask for editable blockchains (whatever that might be). But I digress.
3. i dont understand what you mean with the 2sec/98%. A 1TB block takes roughly the same time of a 1kB to validate... I have no idea what you're on about.
4. About miners not providing value to the network... You lost me here. Are they not the heart of the blockchain?
Now, there's issues with segwit and s2x and all that, but it surely loses all the way when compared with other types of solutions. All arguments in favour boil down to "because profet satoshi said". Even if he/they did, has the technical merit of a 5yo tantrum

But, sure, lets take all this for granted.

"Based on my conversation I got the impression (never confirmed) that he might have been more than one person"
Yes, it's a group of people. So they got a positive match for a group. The technique is so amazing it even fingerprints a group of people.
Wikileaks, your call.

@_date: 2017-08-21 12:18:08
in order
1. in 1 or 2 years, scaling solutions like Lightening will, hopefully, be common. They truly deliver capacity aligned with the right incentives (anybidy could be a channel) that is not dependent on the block size. That's effectively the contribution of segwit for the scaling debate.
2. the Log-scaling (instead of linear scaling like with just increasing the block size) will be provided by layer-2 solutions like Lightning. Look it up.
About link speeds, transit speeds are increasing and there's lots available. Last mile capacity is plateauing. You could, and makes sense, to move all mining gear to a data centre. But now you probably start to see how much this would affect centralisation. If it suddenly needs 100m to startup a mining company, how many do you expect to exist in the near future?
3. correct, your bank does :)

why is it contacting servers? it should all be offline. maybe it's giving codes based on the local time which may not be the poloniex server time
@_date: 2017-01-10 19:21:04
is it me or they did not get how bitcoin works? the 10min is there by design choice, not by any implementation limitation. am i missing anything?
@_date: 2017-08-30 18:09:05
and thanks for this. i'm thinking of going and ask himself a couple of face to face questions
@_date: 2017-08-18 14:03:36
Yes, this is all about communication. As a security professional myself, handling the full cycle is as important as the technical mitigation itself.
i think we have different conceptions of FUD. What he did is valid and helpful work. If he got carried away with minor aspects auch as versions or something, this is no way to handle ethical hacking -- hence, me using the term //posture//. Using terms such as FUD, trying to minimise the importance of his work, has no place when handling security professionally. Praise to the extreme and dont get stuck in minor and irrelevant issues.
Note, however, contrary to what i've done with other products and companies, i still recommend Trezor as you, essentially, got it right.
@_date: 2017-08-19 11:55:07
good answer :) let me just finish:
... and bitcoin mining would be the least of our problems
edit- this is to say i'm so going to steal that for my presentations

That's an interesting project.
Shouldnt be too hard for a first stab at fuzzying text - remove/insert typos, remove &amp; replace words outside a certain distribution, add words outside the same distribution but nor your own, use text generation whenever possible, ...
Then triple translate on google back and forth for complete anonimity at paranoid level 9000.

is this 2015 or i'm missing out?
@_date: 2017-08-17 10:54:49
that makes it even more confusing. so i should send the exact shown amount including the fee? what about wallets that show the exact amount and put the fee on top.
The usability issue is requesting an exact amount. 
@_date: 2017-01-04 20:21:36
that's actually the most secure way to store coins and the beginning of a cold wallet
@_date: 2017-01-07 20:46:24
dont do it and you'd probably breach the contract with your bank so if anything happens they may refuse to cover the losses
i find it too strange that circle is asking for it

@_date: 2016-12-09 15:20:19
For a moment I thought they were sort of pentesting bitcoins' blockchain. That'd be a venerable attempt.
But no, it's as amateur as it sounds. They will prove bitcoin is flawed if nobody hacks Salesforce blockchain by Monday.
@_date: 2016-11-26 00:42:40
that also counts
@_date: 2017-08-18 12:35:38
yes which makes this attack not too critical. I'd say the posture of Trezor is what is alarming.
@_date: 2017-08-07 23:14:30
that's pretty interesting. it makes a lot of sense to have a bitcoin URI - click and pay. This could be a great usability feature.

@_date: 2016-12-12 09:52:45
this is a good example of how I personally see it happening. to a large extent, this is LN just based on trust pretty much like Visa did it a few decades ago - trust and then verify.

i dont really want to jump on the bloco size debate but nick szabo is right about what is remarkable about bitcoin. not only it created a purely digital currency but also something that - so far - seems flawless in terms of security.
Back to the real world, bitcoin devs also deserve appreciation as no serious vulnerability has been found in the implementation of a system that is worth billions. It's a safe holding billions in open sight and nobody has found a way to break it.
@_date: 2016-12-21 18:11:17
i think the halvening has been already assimilated in the summer. This rally though is puzzling me. The recent german fund news helps but only so much.
I am starting to think the rally is really people shopping with btc for xmas. If so, bitcoin has indeed entered maturity. Chinese new year had a similar rally.
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:52:33
how does the exchange make money then?
@_date: 2016-11-14 23:42:06
this has been flagged before as scam
@_date: 2016-12-12 09:51:15
you're assuming bitcoin's "killer app" is paying for coffee. Many in the community (definitely not all or maybe not even the majority) does not see it ever happening. I see the blockchain as a slow but sure settlement layer (even though I dont think this should be imposed by design but rather letting it happen naturally by transactions' growth far outpacing capacity growth).
Second, about centralisation, a system that is aimed at handling bullions per day could never rely on non-professional parties like users running full nodes. So it really depends on what you mean by decentralisation. The current situation is not ideal, but if better geo distributed, i think 10s of big miners is the best we can aim at. Goal is those 10s of miners provide reliability and cost efficiency.
@_date: 2017-08-31 17:05:27
clearly a scam or otherwise someone living in the past. is gpu mining feasible at any length for bitcoin? alternatively, they may be aiming at other coins
@_date: 2016-12-26 11:08:36
I probably got the same emails and this is about their round on Bank to the future. I may have received some 3 and they all made sense as they were explaining the process for people interested in investing. It hardly qualifies as spam.
About insurance, what exactly did you want them to reply?
Still, you do have a good point about proof of reserves. Why did they stop doing it? Maybe bitstamp monitors this and can give an answer.
@_date: 2016-11-21 17:43:21
is there realy a gridlock? I thought SW was being adopted and sort of fast by the vast majority of miners. It's harder to quantify user acceptance but i'd say the vast majority is not even aware of the debate.
@_date: 2016-12-10 18:00:33
there is no goal, especially political or ideological ones. It's a smart &amp; virtual currency and hence a tool - nothing more, nothing less.
Still, it does not mean it cannot be a bridge to something else - like detachment from banks or libertarianism - but that's up to every person.

It all sounds right to me and I could add a couple more reasons. All he is propagating is good security rules especially important when the user is on its own, unlike with banks that have insurance. Browsers should never be trusted, a remote unauditable website even less and javascript is way too vulnerable. Browsers/js are so insecure that they even have their own category of attacks, Man-in-the-Browser, and they're in the top-3 of any assessment.

3B is ridiculous. you dont need a foundry. i'm oversimplifying but it's not that different than desiging a plastic box and then contracting a factory to mass produce it.
Basically, develop the chip and the wrapping hardware/software (a team of 5 could do it) and then have it manufactured). There's a big upfront cost but then. it's on a per-unit basis. i dont have a number but a guestimate would be 10m to start selling the box.

either bitpay got hacked or you did if she knew (1) you're a bitpay customer and (2) you have a mastercard?

@_date: 2017-04-08 14:47:06
lol - but i think he has a point. pgp failed mass adoption because it's too technical for most people and client support with good UI. then, storing the key has always been shady and the "pretty good" part of it ended up meaning "pretty cumbersome". Facebook/Google is doing more for off the shelf SSO/identity than anything else in the past, regardeless of how much i dont like it.
But i do agree usability issues with bitcoin is still a major problem. When people ask me where to go to buy some btc, I still dont know what to say. It's just a long story.
@_date: 2017-04-03 15:25:30
i still dont get what it is. we get paid per file dowloaded but how is it supposed to make bitcoin scale? are we paying for coffee with files?

pretty much. he should know better that a few pages of an academic article can *never* capture the real world finesses, especially on incentives and anything in the netnomics area. been there, done that. just reckless of him
@_date: 2017-04-20 12:50:39
nice article but the text is badly formated and makes it confusing at times eg., 2160 should be 2^160
for a TLDR, the project consists of doing it backwards: generate a key, find a corresponding address and check if there are coins in it. Chances to find 1 is still ridiculously low, yet, they already found 3.
I'll just assume they are good guys and will not do anything evil with them.
cyber security advice: use several addresses to hold your coins
@_date: 2017-04-12 14:20:22
this is amazing. not sure if bitcoin's blockchain is ideal for this but i certainly have nothing against either
@_date: 2016-09-22 12:57:57

crappy article. long with little factual argumentation. He just states his opinions again and again in the most verbose way and still missing the point.
@_date: 2018-03-09 18:35:13
the problem is not exactly personal data but rather consent to use personal data. sending a transaction implies the person accepts it becoming public. So i'd say there's no problem.
@_date: 2018-11-19 19:23:54
what amazes me is they actually bother counting
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:34:47
so you expect the sum of all to keep the original value pre-fork? this sort of thing?
@_date: 2016-09-07 08:52:26
But the problem is it does not solve neither the correctness of data at source (what stops a producer or reseller from cheating?) nor irrevocably links object (like an apple) to information (just swap labels halfway).
In bitcoin and voting systems, it is in the interest of the provider of the information to have it correct and factual and then there is nothing more than a record. So a blockchain works amazingly well.
This is not to say I dont trust there is a business case. I just fail to see it.
@_date: 2016-09-07 19:03:36
Not quite. Everything that needs a register to be tamper-proof and cannot be trusted to a single party is an application of blockchains. E-voting is a promising one. It has never been been solved and one after the other all have been proven to be flawed.
@_date: 2018-11-27 23:05:55
still better than a dude on the internet
@_date: 2018-11-19 23:32:49
there's 3 bch now and they're all throwing hashing power to get the longest chain. fork was on the 15th. mental
@_date: 2016-09-13 09:24:21
I appreciate the effort but those metaphors didnt really help and are unnecessary. 
Bitcoin has a scalability problem and either blocks are increased or something else like sidechains is implemented.
Increasing block sizes may not be scalable in itself; side chains or similar imply a redesign of bitcoin that may not be in the original intent of it and may fundamentally break something that works remarkably well. Are there any other options?
PS: I am only catching up on the debate and it's likely it's not as simple as this.

it sounds like a certificate problem. I just went to coinbase.com and the cert is ok. I dont have an account though so cannot check any further.
Your device might be compromised and this is a common sign. If you're technically minded, double check if you're really connecting to their real website and not a fake. or just use a couple of different devices withbthe same browserand see if it happens always.
be careful

all i've seen is the slides. i did not further googling and have no context.
having said this: laughable. Not only they do not understand why PoW is not a by-product but the essence of why bitcoin is so disruptive but they also think that just because it's got cryptography it's "secure" and the bottle of champagne is safe
question for them: how will they manage the keys?

i was lauding them - then they blew it with "On the contrary, because SE is widely used, it will increasingly attract the attention of hackers.
Instead of jumping on a promise of smart card security, TREZOR has focused on bringing an overall smart security design instead."
They broke two fundamental rules in security: aiming at obfuscation and using too much of out-of-the-box security. 
You're better off using paper wallets and burying them under trees.
@_date: 2016-09-06 17:01:32
why would we need tamper-resistance weather information? or how can a blockchain stop resellers from changing labels?
@_date: 2019-01-07 20:03:41
it's not wrong but
1. if everyone requested a Visa card, it'd probably take that much to produce all cards
2. then only so many transactions are possible with Visa
3. LN greatly helps but i seriously doubt it will ever be possible to design something that works at a world scale without some kind of intermediaries and trust

@_date: 2018-11-03 20:46:54
can you explain in more detail? you bought $1700, typed in your bitcoin address but then it was sent out to a different bitcoin address?
If yes, there's known cases of compromised browsers that detect it is a bitcoin address and then change it directly from your browser once you push submit. Some chrome/firefix addons do that.
If it was that, chances are you lost it. Hope not.

@_date: 2017-09-06 08:58:56
ignore them
the right answer is it depends on the microprocessor you use. If it is 8bit, your bitcoins will be worth 8bit. If a 64b, your bitcoins will be worth 64x times more.
this is the reason why i recommend using Windows 128-bit (for a 128x increase in your bitcoins net worth!) and, for faster transactions, using Firefox 32bit to make transactions smaller.
@_date: 2017-09-04 18:03:53

why would bitcoin help with this?
@_date: 2017-09-01 13:12:49
very curious to see if this trading sorcery works. I think they got the previous predictions right.
@_date: 2017-09-12 10:10:27
mining will forever be there unless PoW is changed. Mining is inherent to verifying transactions
@_date: 2017-10-15 00:25:53
why would you need to manualy sign a transaction? wallets exist for that
@_date: 2017-10-26 18:24:16
That's money in circulation (and only part of it) which is not really representative of the usage (expected) of bitcoin. Just the US debt is 18 trillion. Plus gold as storage of value is some 10 trillion.
Then a large number of BTCs is, likely, forever lost.
So I think a 21T/21m = 1m/BTC is more representative and realistic with massive adoption. Finally, this is at current rates.
If 10% of all this wealth goes in bitcoin, and soon, 1BTC := 100k USD.

what Ledger could do is to have the firmware assessed by a few fairly known independent people and publish the report.
also, since the article is all about the random nb generator, maybe that part can be disclosed. Chances are it's all algorithmic and the internal hw architecture of the chip needs not to be disclosed

as the guy above me says, nothing is perfectly efficient. Bitcoin may be less efficient when validating a transaction but, in the whole, has far more advantages and empowers society on a way cards do not.
Plus, efficiency right now is low.but mostly because bitcoin only handles a handful of transactions per second. When it jumps to millions, I'm not so sure it will be the case.

couldnt agree more. This is nothing but a sales pitch that uses fear to sell.
Whereas the article is obviously correct in that U2F is better than TOTP, there is nothing wrong with google authenticator. It is very very recommendable and safe. To actually bypass it you need a long chain of breaches that is just unlikely. I just wish many other sites.and apps would support it.
on top of everything, security must always marry usability.

for ledger, once you receive your device you can reset and verify the firmware. Then you can create your own key. The recents vulnerabilities are not that serious and there are patches available.
as for if the generated entropy is good or Ledger knows something that allows them to find your keys, true, that's hard to verify. i suppose we'd need a large sample of them and try it out. 
going to send them an email and report bakc :)

@_date: 2017-05-21 19:55:16
in my opinion, overcomplicating security can as problematic. the trick is multifactor: multiple steps in multiple contexts and multiple conditions so that no one and no single breach will open the gates.
In practice, to unlock the coins, the physical wallet (the ledger), the seed on paper in different places (a single one is risky) and a memorable password should be good enough. It needs all three compromised.
Just be careful with generating all the secrets in a secure environment.
@_date: 2017-05-14 13:30:46
very likely it wont because there's only 3 addresses. how'd they know which computer to unlock?
unless there's only 3 keys, which i doubt
@_date: 2017-05-26 09:20:17
in other words, "we've been hacked because we have users"?
@_date: 2017-05-21 22:20:02
maybe i'm missing something but but if you encrypt the seed with a password, and keep both pairs in different places, there's no single point of compromise: physical ledger + pin, seed + password.
btw, you could also break the seed in two and keep one part in a visible spot with some form of tamper-evident sign like an old school paper seal
@_date: 2017-05-20 12:52:41
you mean i create a wallet, use 'constant forest adore false green weave stop guy fur freeze giggle clock' as the seed and then balance instantly vanishes?
it must be the wallet itself doing something, either a non documented feature to prevent using that seed ot it's been compromised which shouldnt really depend on the seed
any ideas?
@_date: 2017-05-30 12:18:25
i think the only metric for success is near full and quick adoption and quickly. Thinking of eth/etc that, despite the fork, nobody seems to really question which one is the "real" ethereum, the full/quick could be, say, &gt;75% of all transactions *and*  in a month or 1000 blocks.

it's been done but mostly out of compromised usb sticks. also never neglect the power of social engineering which makes /you/ the vulnerability
there's cheaper and easier methods, i'd say. a hardware wallet that you can setup offline and with hardware buttons gives you decent security. Legger or trezor for example. easier to physically secure as well.

as the article below explains, ledger says it's unnecessaty and even harmful. Quite frankly, it is disappointing because they rely on keys stored internally and in a factory setting (horror film) and they ignore that best security is layered - if you can add something else, do it. In the case, i really fail to see why not add tamper-evident packaging.
I'd load the wallet with some coins make a couple of transactions and wait 2 weeks to see if they move before storing a significant amount.
@_date: 2017-07-03 14:11:39

Still, about all activity coming from your IP address, do you trust your local network, e.g., WiFi? Is it shared with anyone else? Any neighbours you might think or someone parked outside? Having direct network access to a machine opens up many attacks like WannaCry.

note he looked at it from a python perspective (py is great, py is life, etc), not a security one
@_date: 2017-07-24 08:50:42
for hw wallets with physical buttons and a screen, the key advantage is that it makes you invulnerable to compromised machines like laptops or phones. If you do it right, you never type your seed anywhere so a keylogger is ineffective. You can create the seed just with a usb charger while being completely offline.
then, in order to send out bitcoins you need to push a physical button to  confirm which is as strong security as one can get.
the key weakness is to trust the hardware/firmware has not been compromised. each brand has its own tricks.
if the hw wallet has no screen, no buttons or no convincing explanation about its internal security, you're better off with a paper wallet.

about trusting 3rd parties, i appreciate the argument but i do not read the original whitepaper in the same way. LN does not require any 3rd party to prevent double-spending because channels are created &amp; destroyed on-the-fly and nobody has to use the same at any time. Heck, bitcoin will still work as is now and a transaction can be dumped directly on the chain. The system is still fully decentralised (even more in some aspects) and the side chains are there to aid, without requiring, scalability.
anyone has a different view?

to complement below and being careful with language:
* if i pull my coins to a wallet (regardeless of which or if supports BIP148) before the split, i will have coins on both (sort of a duplicated balance) automatically immediately after the split
* then, after the split, if want to spend coins, i need to use the right wallet depending which coins i am about to use.

electrum does not completely support BIP44 wallets. Yet, sometimes it works. When you import the wallet, Electrum asks you to type in the index (cant remember what they call it). It defaults to 0. If you type 1, you get the second account, assuming it worked for your addresses
Other than that, multibit cuts it cleanly. It takes ages to sync but you'll see all addresses. Problem is multibit is being dropped.

personally speaking, i'd be happy, in general terms, with sw2x. This is way past the technical arguments about scaling capacity.
Thing is i think nobody really knows at this stage what it is about. NYAers cant seems to agree among themselves on a concrete and well-defined proposal (wrt BIP) weeks before it gets pushed put. Then if antpool is really around 51%, and considering all the threats and lack of trust, even if sw2x was clear and the implementation proven robust, there's no guarantees of anything.

TL;DR: the investment is under an Eth smart contrat which in itself is trustless. Problem is the smart contract is controlled by an external, centralised, oracle. Shapeshift provides it and has plans to allow third parties in. So it is trustless only to the point that one can trust the oracle and it doesn't get hacked.

@_date: 2017-06-01 23:35:36
the whole security field is vastly more complex than technicalities. Cards *are* secure and it's not sha1 that will break it. There are very few cases of hacking the card directly or even the protocol. Plus, they're a great example of something you are+know+have which is great password security. The challenge is more breaches, skimming devices in ATMs or detecting fraud patterns -- hence pci/dss compliance and the money they spend in fraud detection systems.
Security is better measured in risk and banks know that for centuries. SHA1 will be around for a long time. It's not a priority.

Generaly speaking, i am finding a lot of posts about UASF very misleading.  Regardeless of personal positions, lets be clear about what UASF is and what is not. UASF *might* lead to segwit, if there's adoption. Right now it is very unlikely.

even though there's things that could work (I vaguely remember something last year maybe in BlackHat) I agree it's not easy - there's just easier options.
In any case, it's not even a question of accessing keys or breaking ciphers. It's the whole lifecycle of a wallet.
I'm sorry to say but you have no idea how end-to-end security works especially usable security. It doesn't even have to be technical.
tip1- ever heard of the $5-wrench attack?
tip2- have you ever heard Google (that you mention) say they have unbeatable security? Why do you think nobody makes such claims?
You are asking people to trust you (because you're a dude on the internet) and because Google and Apple have billions to spend.

now THIS is a new approach. screw TA

i think it's just a flashcrowd. everyone rushes to either buy cheap coins or panic sell.
Exchanges are heavily based on complex APIs and they cannot handle too much traffic. It's really hard (if not impossible) to distribute and load balance their infrastructure.

the wallet holds nothing. you need your private key (or seed words). don't you have it on paper or on a cloud file?
plus, if it is the Petya ransomware, do NOT pay because it will NOT work.

it is NOT secure. see other posts and google jaxx vulnerability. 
edit- the problem is less the vulnerability itself but rather how they are handling it.

a variant of a 51% attack. if a cartel ia created with such hashing power, segwit special addresses would be the least of our problems
anyone has a different view?
@_date: 2017-06-05 18:36:50
no such a thing as security and old java version 
@_date: 2017-06-12 09:31:22
as expected and will not be the first. The wallet is HIGHLY insecure and their response to the vulnerability is absolutely shocking for a business that relies on security.

i like Trezor's decision of not using a secure proprietary element and the price of ledger. Other than that, they both seem to have good reputation.
They're both just expensive USB sticks with a button, anyway.

certificate revokation is one idea the article gave me

I have never heard of BRD but will certainly check it out even if only because you're keeping up the debate in very positive terms. And sorry if I sound harsh. This is the internet after all. :)
I fully agree a software wallet on a laptop managed by someone not technical is risky. Problem is you are also saying phones are more secure than hardware wallets - they're not and they are the best we know so far. The recent findings (and my guess is tried to take advantage of them today) are really minor.and just prove my point. Trezor may need some improvements (really minor and manageable) but Ledger so far has stood the test of time.

there's a patch already and IIRC it only affects high-end servers, not consumer laptops
@_date: 2017-06-26 20:32:07
other reasons but these two should be enough: hardware buttons for confirmation of operations and all keys are generated locally on the device (as if offline)
@_date: 2017-06-06 20:03:33
java is not secure at all and the only way to help is to keep updating which an old phone cant do usually.
anyway, no, i dont know, sorry

sorry to hear that but thanks for sharing
If i got it right, you wanted to transfer from coinbase to poloniex. Then copied the address that poloniex displayed and pasted on coinbase page. Then you submited.
What exactly went wrong? Were you on the legitimate poloniex page? or do you think the address you pasted was changed in your computer just after copying it? Something else?

not sure if there is a ELI5 way to explain all that. That's lots of differemt things.
SHA1 is a hashing function and it can be used in many ways. One that is (moderately) insecure, is to use it for data that will be stored for long periods (say, years). It's been shown that it is not too hard to fake it (google 'shappening') and (with growing computing power) it may be trivial to do it very soon. Using it for short term actions, like payments that have short timeframes (you revoke a card in hours), it's also safe.
Bitcoin uses it not in this way and is valid only for up to 10minutes (a block) so it's safe use. EMV is an industry standard for payments and they basically say they can live with the risk for the time being. There's plenty of other ways to steal money from cards before SHA1 becomes an issue. Plus, if someone finds a way to break a SHA1 hash in, say, hours, they can revoke the carda in the same timeframe.

no - your phone is the least trusted device you own. No shortage of literature explaining that. Worse: 1- most phones dont even get updates so they stay vulnerable for most of their lives and 2- they are portable and small which means they get stolen. If you lose the phone, you lose your money.
Not sure if by secure hardware you mean TPMs and alikes - even if so, many/most phones do NOT have one and even if yes, there are known attacks.
Your post is utterly irreponsible and even laughable if you're trying to build a business on it.
I'm a security professional and researcher and I don't trust my phone even to store a password manager.

i'm as ignorant as anyone else whem it comes to laws and regulations of this natute.
Yet, it's a good article but clearly seems to me out of touch with reality. Fisrt, i'll keep all that in mind next time i pay something in cash and will alert the waiter for the fact that it may be illegal. 
Even in terms of considering bitcoin an electronic transaction like a credit a card payment, payments start and end somewhere and it's those ends that need to keep records. It's not the blockchain that needs to do it. It's not even what it is for.

no need to empty your bank account but do change all passwords you can and move your coins to a different addresses from a computer you trust
do you know what hit you?
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:27:51
damn.. i thought it was Bitmain's statement and the US bill. Turns out it was the 5th Elliott wave.

dont try to outsmart. chances are that password service is biased (so passwords are not that random), they store the passwords (even if out of stupidity) or now we know you use a browser to generate passwordas and chances are you copy/paste (no shortage of broswer clipboard attacks). Really, dont give clues.
