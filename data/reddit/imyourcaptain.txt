You mean those same users who aren't getting their money stolen from a bank? Funny.

What does it matter if it's users are flawed?

To anyone who thinks yesterday was the opportune moment I hope you're selling it today, because the price will be lower.

Data? Why do you need data? It's simple, people mine bitcoin to profiteer, if they don't sell it they don't profit. Thus there is selling pressure. Buying pressure is created when people want them for their intrinsic value, but the only value they currently hold is their ability to make profit. Don't start on transaction speed and fees, that comes from usage, upward price comes from usage. Until there is a better balance between those mining and those using (that is, buying and selling daily without regard for a fluctuating value) the price will continue a downward trend. The fanatic interest of people such as those in this forum is blinding and not enough drive prices up. There needs to be either a larger adoption driven by a major event or a reduction in mining, which will only come by lower prices.

Except demand for bitcoins isn't outstripping supply, quite the opposite actually. So at this current time it is inflationary.

You say tomato I say tomato. Maybe my phrasing could have been better.
Demand will not increase as long as the price is falling, the price is falling because too many people saw it jump so high last year they got dollar signs in their eyes and are sucking the potential out through mining. Like I said the system is imbalanced and will continue this trend until a correction is found through either a massive adoption of demand or the more likely scenario, the value is too low for mining to continue.
I'll note that the price has fallen approx $13 since my first post.

What's the alternative? Bitch and moan and blame everyone else for your problem?
You don't think you can eradicate the world of scammers I hope.

You think that because people want gun control and not a ban on automobiles they don't use an evidence based approach? Do you hear yourself?

My understanding of a "darkwallet" is that it is meant to hide a user from being tracked, so no one can see how they spent their money. But this clashes with my understanding of the blockchain where all records are kept on the public ledger. 
Could someone clarify this for me?

Until it becomes bloated with bureaucracy and people complain about it to no end, I feel like I've heard this story.

Not really, if the buy to sell ratio was one to one the price would be steady, the fact the price is crashing proves there are way more sellers.

I think we should create a country where there are no laws, no taxes to pay, no hierarchy, and anyone who wants to renounce their citizenship can go there and people who talk like this can go there and all live as they will.  I wonder how that would work out?
@_date: 2015-01-14 22:04:07


Isn't that what I said?
@_date: 2015-02-02 22:16:44
Well working a job last year didn't *lose* you 73% 
@_date: 2015-02-19 14:50:54


Except if you scroll down to the last graph.


And the same pattern, plus more, becomes apparent. I don't know why people refuse to believe what's in front of them, what advantage is there to not acknowledge this is what happened?
@_date: 2015-02-19 15:28:13
Yeah you're not being helpful, you're kinda being a dick.
@_date: 2015-02-03 14:29:06
lol, maybe ease off the dope my friend

So you don't think it's at all possible that it will remain in use while something else is created and used de facto by the banks? In that scenario it becomes a niche product that doesn't die off but also doesn't take off. It's reached a point now where people will continue using it for a long time to come whether or not it displaces the dollar.
