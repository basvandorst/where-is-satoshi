I’m new to crypto but am a old war dog in stocks. When the market crashed, i just went to youtube and watched videos on how to make homemade carbonara. 
These people freaking out causes FUD, and telling them to shut the fuck up causes more FUD, so the best course is to buy more (crashes are like a money train pausing so that you can jump on) and rub one out. Now if you excuse me, its pasta �� time
(I will say I’m glad bitconnect was exposed, that will help us all in the long run. TY for that guys ��).

I’m ready to place an order for 1,000,000 POTcoins. That equals to my whore ex getting slapped to death and my dick exploding, right?? Sounds good to me ��

Wait a minute!! Tai Lopez said this himself on one of his podcasts about two weeks ago. He was talking about how there is no GPU inventory left ������
You’re quoting Tai Lopez’s insight to say he has no insight ��

I’m so sorry you wrote all that, I’m not going to read it since I’m enjoying free content by multiple positive speakers at the moment. Bye loser.

What? Why are you talking about legacy and potential lawsuits?? Again with the slight that he rents the mansion? Where do you live, O Great Crypto Genius?? I 100% guarantee you Tai rented on purpose specifically to write it off on his taxes as a business expense. And of course you work in a university, your argument is burdened with debate fallacies. 
Dude, Tai offers so much free content and advice on his free podcast that it’s ridiculous. I love his talks, and you clearly DO NOT listen to Tai since the man has a huge boner for reading. He even straight up says you’re stupid if you don’t read and seek knowledge. 
You obviously don’t listen to Tai, why are you giving your ignorant opinions on him then? You’re just parroting other unfounded crap people say when they talk about him. Do I think his bitcoin class is cheesy? Of course, and I use this little awesome feature called Skip to gloss over ads. He has even said it himself, everything he offers in his paid courses are just condensed versions of what he pontificates on his regular free podcasts. You pay for the shortened convenience only if you’re a fool. Everything else is absolutely free. I’ve been listening to Tai Lopez for over a year now and have never spent a penny. But a man offering free education would upset you wouldn’t it, University worker?? ��

Renting a mansion makes him a fraud? You do know mansion rents start at $10,000 and go up from there??? The norm is typically $25,000 monthly. Even if he is renting, he’s doing better than all of us squabbling chickens �� 
I’m not Tai Lopez, but let’s be realistic here. Tai releases a shit load of free info on podcasts. Don’t pay for the programs, just listen to the free stuff and I think you’ll enjoy it.

To be honest, if I had a corner shop and someone wanted pay for milk I’m bullion, my inner Jew would come out so hard as I rubbed my hands together and accepted it.
