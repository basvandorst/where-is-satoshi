There's no way anyone is ever going to pay VAT on the price a bitcoin. It's not viable and it's too easy to get around by buying from an offshore exchange. 
The only money they're leaving on the table is potentially VAT on exchange fees - but that isn't any real amount of money there and won't be for a few years at least.. also I expect that bitstamp may already be paying VAT on their fees anyway, so they're not even leaving that on the table.
IMO The law will definitely be changed in the future (either bitcoin will be explicitly classified as 0% rated for VAT like gold, or it will just be found to be foreign exchange which is already 0 rated) - this is just a way to try and help bootstrap bitcoin.

IMO the UK's stance is probably deliberate - but not in a bad way. They just want to encourage p2p trading to get people more involved in the bitcoin economy. The VAT issue basically makes it impossible for any UK company to sell bitcoins (and limits each individual to around £70k in sales per year).. so assuming say a 5% markup they've basically created a new cottage industry for anyone who wants to setup as a bitcoin trader to make ~£3500/yr in profit for manually processing bank transfers. Not very interesting for the elite, but lots of regular people would be very happy to be making this extra cash.
If mtgox still had their GBP bank account localbitcoins and bitbargain would almost never be used as it used to be so easy to just make a local bank transfer to mtgox.. that's an efficient way to get bitcoins, but it's a bad way to build a new economy and encourage social interaction.
