Bitcoin is just pseudoanonymous. Coins are not 100% fungible. There will never be anonymity. Just obfuscation is possible and you have to be super smart about it. Maybe for small transactions but no way millions can be 'anonymized'.
@_date: 2019-07-22 17:00:55
I never understood why would people want to taint their Bitcoin. Maybe it is good that they can be deanonymized - it is better for them if they were not connected to any crime.
And yes, Bitcoin is not fungible and never will be. Mixing services are good for criminals and a trap for unsuspecting public. I'd rather buy weed with my own wallet than with coins previously paid for child pornography I got mixing my good coins with.
Use real private crypto FFS!
@_date: 2019-07-29 18:49:45
That's just a difference between crypto and something like gold. I am not judging what is better and comparing features. I just want to use both but unless we have some proper standardized way how to transfer gold around the world for the average joe - gold has very limited use. This can be fixed but it seems only few understand it. Guys like Schiff are dumbing gold down instead of building better gold with technology. In my view Bitcoin is very similar to gold in this regard - both needs upgrades - but crypto folks understand it and try to build things - too bad gold bugs just don't give a shit about tech.

Gold guys should really wake up ASAP. I am trying to tell them that if they don't put gold on the blockchain or find some other way to lower the friction of using gold down by some real magnitude they will be having a really hard time.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:32:48
This is incorrect. You could argue the same way that crypto is centralized in vaults aka crypto exchanges - or future banks holding crypto. Where do you think people are going to store their life savings in crypto? Maybe they can dig a hole in the ground and save the seed there? They can do that with gold as well. 
The only real edge Bitcoin does have over gold is transfer across borders. That's a killer app.
@_date: 2019-07-29 17:32:36
both have big challenges - you can improve gold like this: have a network of bullion facilities that are backing coins they issue with their safely stored gold.
@_date: 2019-07-11 20:23:12
That's like comparing Bitcoin to altcoins though. The network effect is just so much bigger. Also some altcoins can be technologically better in so many ways the same way Bitcoin is better than gold. But does it matter?

Normal people store money in a bank account or with stock brokers etc. This is not something unusual. Also in the future most normal people will store crypto in a bank. I don't see a problem - you can always have a choice to store your own crypto or hide your own gold.

it's called a log scale. it's natural because it's like thinking in how much you can gain - if you buy for 5 and sell for 10 then you have the same profit as if you buy for 5k and sell for 10k. on a linear scale it would visually  exaggerate the movement during high prices and the movement from 5 to 10 would not be visible.

bitcoin is hard to change, that's true. some other crypto could step up and improve the tech. how about zk-starks? great privacy&amp;scalability. could be implemented in a fairly distributed and open coin like monero or litecoin. it is quite likely that there won't be new coins but rather the best coins get better i think. new coins are good for novel solutions and creating new ecosystems, it is very hard to launch a new coin that will be the biggest because the tech will get copied by other coins with larger network effect and people will have no reason to flock to some new coin.

Doesn't need to be a scam. No idea. But - the black market needs to have a way how to launder non-fungible coins like Bitcoin. The question is why would anybody use it not being a criminal? I think there are many but due to their ignorance that they could have more problems than anonymity they didn't need so much in the first place.
Fungible coins like Monero are the only way to go if you want privacy. Don't mix your clean Bitcoins just for the sake of privacy. It can backfire greatly.

Not that I completely disagree with you but Bitcoin in the future if widely used would move off chain and smaller transactions done p2p in LN or with other solutions that will emerge.

spam? well, i have heard some stories but it seems like a weak argument. the transactions were expensive as fuck also because bitcoin was popular. i was transacting like 10x as much personally (but i was just called a russian troll bot spam farmer whatever does that mean anyway and am a bit autistic too).

Well if you have your bitcoin in a safety deposit box only you can access then a $5 wrench attack doesn't work on you. If you are really that paranoid about your stash than you should never have access to your stash at all times. Better put it somewhere where you physically need to come and be in a contact with like in a bank - a safety deposit box. Use ledger or store the seed split in half in 2 safety deposit boxes in different banks to be 100% safe not even the bank can steal your coins.

I get it, you only see one world build on Bitcoin. But if you looked better you might find there are other worlds as well. Building predictions markets or governance structures, or DEXes. How many of those applications are build on Bitcoin currently? Most crypto development with smart contracts is currently done on Ethereum and Rootstock is still not a thing.
I'll quote you from your linked thread:
\&gt;And with Simplicity and the imminent launch of tech like Rootstock, Bitcoin's smart contracting capabilities are expanding as we go.
Ethereum has that already for years and people are using it. Thanks for admitting it  'expanded the capability' - that's what we were looking for in this thread. And I mentioned from the start Rootstock could provide - but is already behind the schedule.

What if it keeps going higher?
@_date: 2019-04-08 18:37:46
Daily still has some room to run to challenge multiple all time RSI highs - also weekly RSI only about 57.
Also note that the bear market ended with an extreme RSI on the daily, never seen before! On weekly it was at all time low.

Care to explain?
@_date: 2018-11-04 15:57:35
I suggest taking a look at the gold market. People gave up real metal very easily - most people just buy paper and are alright with it. So - I am not very optimistic that it would be any different with BTC. Yes, it's easier to transfer but also more easily stolen - most people will be fine with BTC balance in their internet banking.
@_date: 2018-11-08 18:58:51

Any shitcoin is a p2p cash system - nice use case, but there is more to Bitcoin than that is what I was trying to say.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:41:11
I think that is cowardly of you to say that. You either want Bitcoin to be a decentralised censorship resistant world money or not. You can't have it both ways. Well, Bitcoin doesn't care anyway :)

employer can obtain bitcoin by selling stuff for bitcoin, duh. if you insist on that you have to use fiat to get into bitcoin than alright, there is a fee but only on entrance - anyway - fees are normal, even in the bitcoin world, but the services are decentralised so they don't have the force to rip you off like a mob

@_date: 2018-11-20 17:26:03
Don't be naive, Bitcoin is much more than just another currency to spend for consumables
@_date: 2018-11-10 09:47:51
No because it would need a hard fork. I think it has no chance happening even with a soft fork. You will never have consensus for something like that. We don't have a consensus on trivial issues like block size. I think of Bitcoin as set in stone basically.
@_date: 2018-11-12 21:37:28
U.S. sanctions against Bitcoin would not work, they don't control the infrastructure like they do with SWIFT. If Iran starts trading with Europe, Russia or other countries in Bitcoin then US can do nothing about it. It doesn't help that they block it on US Exchanges because Bitcoin doesn't need exchanges to make payments. They would just block their own citizens or maybe Europeans because some exchanges would be scared of losing their American business - but other exchanges would crop up soon.
OK, now back to reality - Europeans are already working on SWIFT alternative which should be ready in 2019 so they can freely trade with Iran. Bitcoin is just too small and immature, but technology is already there.
@_date: 2018-11-08 19:14:00
the problem is that there is no incentive to use green energy, 
there is no regulation to maintain just enough security - price doesn't reflect that
there could be better ways to secure the network but Bitcoin will not change regardless

Satoshi invented Bitcoin after the Great Recession to give people means to financially protect themselves and be their own bank. Using crypto for paying for coffee and other trivialities is important but it is not the sole purpose nor a problem with current monetary system we want to remedy.
@_date: 2018-11-01 23:17:50
It's likely but I doubt we will ever know. Crypto was just a matter of time - it would have been invented by someone else if there was no Satoshi. It's quite obvious it is better to start it and have some control than to leave it others and have no control - I don't believe NSA was not smart enough - but maybe they just waited for somebody else to do it but of course they must have taken notice from the very start and thus take the safer approach to not get directly involved in the creation but still be involved early enough.

@_date: 2019-01-15 19:39:17
I agree that we are a long way from using powerful quantum computers - but I think you can not use your multiplier theory to compare quantum computers and normal ones. It works more like that once you have a big quantum computer it can get the task done almost instantly - but you cannot stack multiple computers/chips but rather you have to add more qubits to be able to crunch that number which is difficult - would love to read a good explanation from someone more knowledgable about this
@_date: 2019-01-25 15:25:10
lol, i wish i knew what will Bitcoin be worth in the future
your logic also fails because nobody would buy anything and just hoard investments in equities, real estate and other stuff because you can buy consumer goods cheaper in the future - and you have better guarantees of future appreciation from stocks rather then this emerging crypto asset - yeah, people don't buy goods with stocks directly but that is just a technical detail, they would if they could - no reason to hold depreciating fiat

The problem is not the trolls coming here, the problem is all the people around the world looking at Bitcoin (with their mostly leftist mindset) reading and talking about Bitcoin. We better discuss it here and look for answers - dismissing the idea will not make the problem go away.
Good that you pointed out gold's polluting issues - BUT - not sure if the argument is very good, very few people like gold these days so they find gold mining unwanted as well - and they don't understand what makes private money like Bitcoin and gold so great (because they are leftists).
@_date: 2019-01-08 16:29:12

Leftists are for big government and thus don't understand private money, or private property and don't value freedom - they want to create money out of thin air and spend it for everybody's needs. In that context they see Bitcoin as useless because they don't understand the benefits - it's just some currency you use for payment.

It also doesn't make sense to costly mine in space for gold which we have a huge stockpile here on earth already and we don't really need more. I think central banks and governments who hold a lot of gold will just push to ban such a practice anyway - as a byproduct is ok i guess

Increased usage as a store of value is more important for the price than buying stuff
@_date: 2019-05-31 20:49:31
there is plenty of gold - the question is what's the price you can mine it for. asteroid mining is very expensive and would be used looking for more precious things than gold. the price of gold needs to rise a lot more for people to start thinking of mining it in space. and asteroid mining is CERTAINLY not going to happen within 10 years.
