They still haven't verified my account, it's been weeks.

Should've used Drake.

It's in alpha.

What's USDT?
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:09:16
This is how crypto will go mainstream!

Because you're wrong? It's confirmed to be compliant to Islam.

Customs authority seizes chip cards so not really an option.

He might be a fool but math doesn't lie.

"How Bitcoin is mined" is searched more. Source: Google Keyword Tool.
@_date: 2017-12-24 09:23:05
Bitcoin is the strongest foundation. Highest number of users, developers, and miners. Companies like Microsoft refuse to work on BCH and other unproven cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-24 11:05:25
Users, developers, and miners. Read.
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:29:11
It meets all the conditions.
@_date: 2018-08-27 16:50:53
The more you sell, the lower the price goes. There aren't enough buyers that can absorb all the BCH.
@_date: 2018-08-09 00:45:41
Yes. His new book is called 'Fake'. Doesn't mean he's wrong about bitcoin being people's money though.
@_date: 2018-08-30 02:55:11
Who's the one providing the service?
@_date: 2018-08-26 21:55:32
And they can't sell their stash without killing BCH. That's the important part.
@_date: 2018-08-23 18:27:22
Isn't fake money entering cryptocurrencies as well? What would happen in the event of another economic collapse?
@_date: 2018-05-24 01:13:33
This is what I'm waiting to buy!
@_date: 2018-08-28 22:33:24
This is why you dollar cost average.

What time does he say it at? The video is too long.
@_date: 2018-05-09 18:33:15
If he doesn't understand it, he should stay quiet instead of calling it rat poison at every opportunity he gets.

I'll automatically catch on when bitcoin hits $1 million.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:39:25
And one of them was 51% attacked just few days ago. I I wouldn't ever sell my BTC because I'm sure I'll regret it in the future.
@_date: 2018-06-09 20:10:22
The supply is limited so it's bound to go up in price.
@_date: 2018-06-23 04:53:31
Cash App.

This is why you use Mayer Multiple. 
@_date: 2018-11-21 18:37:11
You should watch Trace Mayer's videos.

Or pocket it for themselves.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:01:20
Watch Trace Mayer's videos if you want to understand this.
@_date: 2018-11-17 18:21:59
Worth watching the full thing.
@_date: 2018-11-28 22:49:44
It'll get better with the recently added web payments API. Buckle up.
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:47:26
Compound profit.
@_date: 2018-11-16 21:17:34
He came up with Mayor Multiple, which has been very helpful for a lot of buyers (and sellers). Guy knows his stuff.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:31:41
When Mayer Multiple is below 1.2 or 0.9. It's hovering around 0.9 right now: 
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:25:11
It'll always go up. Supply is limited.
@_date: 2018-11-28 04:54:27
Bakkt will have a Lightning competitor?
@_date: 2018-11-20 11:58:21
Use mayer multiple and dollar cost average. The price is very undervalued now when you compare it to 200 day moving average.
@_date: 2018-03-05 06:41:31
Truth will eventually catch up.
@_date: 2018-11-30 05:20:23
I do. I shrugged Bitcoin off as scam. ����‍♂️
@_date: 2018-11-25 19:49:11
He says it's a conservative prediction and it could easily be 10 Million.
Source: His interview with CNBC Africa.
@_date: 2018-03-17 12:01:23
200 day moving average is up too.
@_date: 2018-03-18 10:58:00
Still on track.
 And I assume poeple won't let it go below $5000 since the fundamentals didn't change.
@_date: 2018-02-13 21:09:07
Bitcoin doesn't need marketing. Word of mouth is enough.
@_date: 2018-02-23 11:05:53
He should stop trying to mislead people first, greed has consumed him.
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:55:10
Only needs to grow less than 0.50% per day to hit $1M in 2020. Look up compounding.
@_date: 2018-11-23 10:00:11
Yep. And use mayer multiple to figure out at what stage the price is at right now.
@_date: 2018-02-15 19:22:38
I want to help my father retire and be worry-free about our future.

Are you an American citizen?
@_date: 2018-03-08 19:59:01
Did you wait hours for orders to fill before?
@_date: 2018-11-20 15:25:43
Bitcoin can't handle mass adoption at the moment. We have to wait for tech like Lightning to mature.
@_date: 2018-02-24 00:23:31
You might wanna consult with a tax guy then. 
@_date: 2018-03-22 00:01:21
Ethereum isn't a currency. It's an app platform.
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:51:01
No capital gains tax. Citizenship takes 10 years though. They even have a place called "Crypto Valley" where Ethereum Foundation and various other blockchain startups are incorporated.
@_date: 2018-03-25 03:22:20
Holding BTC is a motivation in itself to work on making it better for everyone and reap the rewards. Bitcoin assumes everyone will act in their own self-interest, that's the genius of it.
@_date: 2018-02-16 01:57:02
 A Porsche for me!
@_date: 2018-07-19 04:10:56
It's price divided by 200 day moving average.
Under 0.9 = very undervalued (it's time to buy!)
0.9 - 1.2 = undervalued
1.2 - 2.0 = fairly valued
2.0 - 2.9 = overvalued
2.9+ = very overvalued
@_date: 2018-07-22 09:24:49
Perfectly balanced.
@_date: 2018-07-29 07:23:35
Custodian exchanges too.
@_date: 2018-07-09 01:06:30
I was grinning.
@_date: 2018-07-18 20:09:56
Buy when mayer multiple is below 1.2, sell when it goes crazy like 2.0+ or 2.9+.
@_date: 2018-07-19 05:07:39
You bought at a good time! Good luck on your lambo purchase in the future (or an all-electric Porsche Taycan ��)
@_date: 2018-03-31 05:48:39
Mayer Multiple (current price ÷ 200 day moving average) below 9.0 is always strong buy.
@_date: 2018-07-15 19:05:19
Do that when Mayer Multiple is below 9.0 and you'll be fine
@_date: 2018-07-10 19:10:53
Most startups fail. It's hardly surprising.
@_date: 2018-04-17 15:03:55
Tim Draper said cashiers will be annoyed if you try to pay with cash in 5 years, and we'll all be paying with BTC. That doesn't seem so far since China is doing it already.
@_date: 2018-04-13 18:32:43
We need something to pay with on the internet and cards are laughably behind times, so it's not impossible if we can scale Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:26:29
I'm sure we could adopt it in Bitcoin itself or a layer 2 soluion/smart contract. No need of banks.
@_date: 2018-04-05 05:24:20
When it's below 1.2 Mayer Multiple (price ÷ 200 DMA), it's on discount. Below 0.9 is strong buy.
@_date: 2018-04-07 21:02:39
The fundamentals of Bitcoin are intact. And we're making a lot of progress with Lightning.
@_date: 2018-04-07 07:03:36
Goddess of Thunder.
@_date: 2018-04-06 03:50:20
Probably when it's out of beta.

His other company is Square, not Stripe.
@_date: 2018-04-16 13:32:36
 $1,000,000 by 2020
@_date: 2018-12-03 10:23:24
Bitcoin will always go up as long as it has utility because of its limited supply. There's no point caring about short term price fluctuations when it has been the  performing asset since its introduction.
@_date: 2018-12-12 17:02:02
Bitrefill and eGifter offer Uber gift cards too. Check which one's the cheapest.
@_date: 2018-12-03 09:18:56
Those who don't care about price are queitly building the infrastructure. It takes time.
@_date: 2018-12-12 22:28:08
Thanks again ��
@_date: 2018-12-07 20:08:41
Look up Mayer Multiple.
