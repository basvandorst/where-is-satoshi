When you travel back in time to buy bitcoin and have unprotected sex, do you ever affect the future (the present for you i guess)?

Hodl doesnt mean you have to hold every satoshi you ever bought.  HODLers are people who are in it for the long haul.  You'd be hard pressed to find deep HODLers who have never sold a satoshi.
