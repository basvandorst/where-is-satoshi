You'll have to read through his tweets from the last few days.  He's selling flamethrowers to help fund The Boring Company.
@_date: 2018-01-17 14:14:15
I think it means he owns bitcoin and really wants it to go to 40,000

Should point out that this video is about a month old.
@_date: 2018-01-29 06:14:42
Junk?  He's sold 7k of them on the first day.

Expect strong fluctuations on days that end in 'y'

People on the east coast are just waking up to this now..
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:09:19
This is the concern.  When evryone's dip buying money runs out there's nothing to stop the price from just falling and falling
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:07:47
Yikes.  Charlie Munger just said bitcoin is total insanity and to avoid it like the plague.  Not good.

Christmas dinner is going to be uncomfortable for some.

I've sold some small amounts to buy Tesla shares but other than that I'm staying for 50,000
@_date: 2017-12-01 13:24:16
This way is more confusing.
@_date: 2017-12-14 09:40:19
I sold a small amount to buy Tesla shares.  In my opinion this is better than charity since the money is being used to support a good cause without actually being spent.  I can help Tesla and still give the money to charity at a later time (hopefully an increased amount!).
@_date: 2017-12-22 14:28:04
It just got a LOT harder to convince new people to buy bitcoin in any significant amount any time soon.  It's not going to be a short road back up.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:38:48
Parabolic rises crash when they go vertical.  It clearly went vertical.  2-3000 is entirely possible.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:34:07
If it breaks above 9250 in the next 10 minutes there should be as spike to at least 9500.  If not you'd better hope 9000 holds.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:05:48
Unfortunately most of the people who were so hyped have already bought.  You need new buyers for the price to rise.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:15:17
How so?  Is $50B worth of bitcoin not twice as much as $25B worth of bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:33:04
Of course failure here could mean retest of 9000.. welcome to bitcoin
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:12:32
If 9800 (the 60min ma) doesn't hold in the next 5 minutes or so I'd expect a drop to the low 9000's fairly quickly.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:43:23
Since the peak we've been making lower highs and lower lows.  So long as this continues be cautious - fear can build in the same way greed/hype can.  To be honest I don't sense any fear at all yet which is troubling.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:30:43
How did I know this?  Because professional momentum traders are controlling the price according to technical analysis.  This is also how I know 11,400 will not be reached again for a very long time.  It's called a 'blow-off top' in charting.  There will be at best a long period of consolidation now.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:33:17
I wouldn't be comfortable at all until above 10600.  We're still in a downtrend.  As dip buying runs out we could start moving lower again
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:47:25
You're down 8 cents?  Just stay strong, don't panic.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:15:39
Breaking above 9900 would be very positive.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:51:29
The supply of bitcoin is not limited.  If the price of bitcoin doubles, then there is twice as much bitcoin and it is twice as hard for the market to support that amount.  The nominal quantity of coins is meaningless.  Market cap is the 'amount'.  Think harder people.
Fairly warned be ye, says I.
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:29:19
Another point is that after a drop like this a lot of people buy the dip, which helps stop the fall.  As the dip buyers' funds dry up if no new buyers arrive it will start to fall again.  That's why I want this to get moving higher sooner than later.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:40:07
It's reasonable to take some profits when you're up 5,10X in less than a year
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:37:18
We need to make a higher high to break the downtrend.   The last high was at 10,600
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:18:03
Lack of fear means there could be fear to come.  Right now everyone is assuming this is just a brief pause and we'll be off to the races soon.  The longer this doesn't happen the more people will question whether it will.  Some people start to sell and it becomes harder to attract new buyers to a market that doesn't seem to be going up any more.  Then it exacerbates.  This is how sentiment can shift.  Not saying it will happen but be aware of the possibility.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:00:45
Want to hold above the previous low at 9140.  Definitely want to hold 9000 or look out below.
@_date: 2017-11-30 18:17:46
Those are legal tender.  You can buy and sell things with them without incurring a capital gain/loss on every single transaction.
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:09
Do you not know what happens when a parabolic chart reaches vertical?  It crashes.  100% of the time.  This can go A LOT lower.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:02:24
Doesn't look like it yet.  I'd pay a little extra to wait for a clear break higher.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:21:22
Need to stay above 9550 or we'll probably retest 9000 fairly quick.
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:19:43
Hopefully new low at 9420 will hold, then break previous high at 9900, then need to break 10600
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:22:06
@_date: 2017-11-30 21:47:35
The lack of concern is actually really worrisome.  After a blow-off top you usually don't see a bottom until there's panic selling.  Bitcoin is unique so hopefully this will be different but I wouldn't completely count on it.  Bitcoin investors are still people.
@_date: 2017-11-30 12:58:31
The problem is tax agencies count bitcoins as assets, so there is a capital gain or loss every time you buy, trade, or spend one.  So long as this is true they aren't very useful for everyday transactions - everything you do becomes a tax event.
@_date: 2017-11-30 13:46:39
It's very, very important that it doesn't fall much below 9150.  I'd be concerned if it does - the bottom would fall out at least temporarily.
@_date: 2017-11-30 14:16:03
I'm not trying to be a jerk, and I'm actually a fan of bitcoin, but if you're investing anything other than 'fun money' I'd suggest learning about 'blow-off tops' in technical analysis.  Then look at the bitcoin chart.  If you think $2000 in the next few months isn't possible then I'd say you are simply wrong (I'm not predicting it, I'm just saying it would be pretty standard following a blow-off top of this magnitude, so it's possible).  Fear is just as powerful as greed.  Be safe.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:09:01
When a parabolic rise goes vertical you usually get a lot worse than a dip.  Hopefully bitcoin proves different.
@_date: 2017-11-30 20:58:10
Exactly.  Breaking below 9000 would mean this isn't over.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:28:23
Some resistance at 10,000 then all clear to 10,600
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:05:09
I wouldn't do this unless you understand technical analysis.  Trading is a zero sum game so if you are worse than average at it then you are at a disadvantage and are much better off hodling.  If your plan is just to buy low and sell high then I guarantee you will be worse than average.  This volatility has attracted pretty much every professional trader out there.  Just my opinion of course, it's your money so it's your decision to make.

The problem is most people follow regulations whether they can get around them or not.
