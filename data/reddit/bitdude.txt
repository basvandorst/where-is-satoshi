TOKYO, Feb 26 (Reuters) - Japanese authorities are looking into the abrupt closure of Mt. Gox, the top government spokesman said on Wednesday in Tokyo's first official reaction to the turmoil at what was the world's biggest exchange for bitcoin virtual currency.
"At this stage the relevant financial authorities, the police, the Finance Ministry and others are gathering information on the case," Chief Cabinet Secretary Yoshihide Suga told a regular news conference when asked about Tuesday's shutdown of the Tokyo-based exchange.
Speaking shortly after The Wall Street Journal reported that Mt. Gox had received a subpoena from federal prosecutors in New York, Suga declined further comment.
Japan's Financial Services Agency and Finance Ministry told Reuters on Tuesday that they do not have jurisdiction over Mt. Gox after the exchange's website went down and efforts to reach company officials failed. The Bank of Japan said it had nothing to add to a comment by Governor Haruhiko Kuroda that bitcoin was "very interested" in bitcoin.
Mt. Gox later posted a statement on its site saying it had halted "all transactions for the time being in order to protect the site and our users."
Mt. Gox CEO Mark Karpeles told Reuters in an email: "We should have an official announcement ready soon-ish. We are currently at a turning point for the business. I can't tell much more for now as this also involves other parties." He did not elaborate on the details or give his location.

1. Because after the creation of the SEC in 1934, we have had just as many booms/busts and fraud. The SEC oversaw the Maddoff, MF Global and Lehman failures. What is the point of an agency that obviously fails at everything it does.
2. MF Global was a deratvies brokers and poeple had segregated funds in their accounts. So yes, these people had cash deposists. I don't see your point either way since the SEC regulates securities. The FDIC is the one that insures retail depositors. MF Global was a lot more similar to Neo and Bee in that sense.
3. So what? He was running a ponzi scheme with deposited funds. What is your point? How did the SEC prevent this? They knew for over a decades from letters they got this was the case. Because of the SEC, people kept putting money in maddoff because they were under the illusion that it was regulated. At least with bitcoin people have to do their due diligence. When was the last time you did some due diligence on your local bank before opening an account there? Of course, never because you think the FDIC willl protect you. But it won't because he doesn't have the means during a systemic collapse.
4. So after nearly 100 years of SEC rule they still can't prevent MF global scams. Seems like they are useless. What kind of track record is that.
5. Yes, see the 800 billion TARP money given to banks. That's nearly a trillion dollars taken from you to cover massive systemic fraud in banking. Is this what you call SEC regulation success??!

No need to go through lengthy application process with CC payment processors, which require background and credit checks, large deposits or percentage of sales that remains with processors to ensure against fraud.
Not limited by CC terms as to what can be sold (as a lot of them ban online marketing products, gambling, pornography etc).

Crazy? I think you are crazy. To think anything the state does is to protect citizens is foolish. Begging the state to change any of its immoral laws is also futile. Thugs will be thugs. Only way is to circumvent them like bitcoin

The whole point of bitcoin is to not have a central authority. Don't understand why this guy is pushing for one. If so, Stick to PayPal dude.
If you loose cash, you loose it - like bitcoin. No one will give your lost cash back to you. Why should bitcoin be any different?
Bitcoin is not threatened by a better version of it - yet. In any case the bitcoin protocol can be updated.

I think we have a different notion of what property is. You make a distinction between personal and private property. I do not because a laptop can be seen as both a personal possession as well as a means of production if used by someone else.
Neither forms require a state by the way.
My guess is that you have do not operate a business and have little experience with markets so you have little personal exposure to how a business works. This leads you to your conclusions. I could be wrong, but I doubt it.

Governments are in it for the long game and slow to act. Incrementalism is the name of the game. They slowly bowl you to death.
Bitcoin is not approved and will not be. It is incompatible with theft through taxation. KYC/AML is all about taxation. They don't care about terrorism and drugs, hell they fund both.
If bitcoin is approved you might as well switch to Facebook credits, because the state will render it impotent.
The digital currency concept is out of the bag. Government resistance will be vicious but ultimately futile.

Funny you should say that considering that the computer you are using to make this was made in China along with your clothing and most of your surroundings. The Chinese workers were not paid German minimum wage, yet I bet you aren't complaining.

I find Proudhon definition that property is theft self-contradictory and unable to define the distinction between possession and private property. Who defines what is a possession and what isn't is a mystery that maybe you can help me understand. Even if there was a distinction, I do not see one being more legitimate than the other.
I would however be happy to send you $20 in bitcoin if you were to call into the show. You will get a better outlet to define your terms and express your views. How does that sound?

Matonis, Ver and Jeff Berwick are all great speakers.
Lukejr and jgarzik are statist nerds who look like geeks, with no business knowledge. Not as bad as Amir true. I would not use their PR advice as their advice on getting laid.
There is nothing extreme about anarchism. It is a philosophy that promotes non aggression and private property. The people who see it as extreme are those who need their heads examined.

You have no understanding of libertarianism. If you think stealing from your neighbor by force to pay for your healthcare/roads/etc is moral, then you are the naive one.

Fair enough, it's just that Ripple is misleading people into thinking it is open and not try to coopt bitcoin. It's a trojan horse, so sure let it be but I would not encourage newbies to be suckered into it.

This guy is just bitter he got screwed by the system, and instead of learning his lesson and walking away, he is still fighting in court.

So they are buying the real stocks on their trading account from orders placed by torbroker customers
If a fed places an order for say 1208 shares and then tries to find out who on the market has bought that exact amount, then they can trace the real world trading account of torbroker.I wonder how they intend to deal with that, or maybe that is not possible.

That's the whole issue. You cannot stop paying taxes no matter if you use or not the services. It is the exact opposite of the free market.
Let's say I have used the provided services. So what? Do you have any obligation to your kidnapper if he fed you while you were kidnapped?

We agree partially at least. I suggest you look into the ethical issues surrounding taxation - it is quite mind blowing when you get past what we have been taught since we were kids.

Interesting you are unable to understand donutmucher's point. Have you ever sad down and peeled off the legal emphamisms to understand what they actually mean.
