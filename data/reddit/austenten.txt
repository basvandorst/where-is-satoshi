You're making it seem like it was the OPs fault, but its not, apparently like spam transactions, which happens to push up fees. Now, I wonder what company might profit from promoting spam on the bitcoin network....
@_date: 2016-08-12 03:21:23
I didn't know about this. So why - and more importantly how - does the OP have so many inputs in one tx? i.e. What did he do to increase his fees?

As I said, it was created in extreme secrecy (then signed into effect by Wilson), those who attended signed in under pseudonyms, and that secrecy surrounding the Fed continues to this day. The author of that book is a director of the Seqoia Fund, a multi billion dollar investment firm. You think he's going to write an anti-Fed book? Further, I wouldn't trust 95% of books or articles championing the Fed, only adds fuel to the propaganda machine.
All this to say, you seem to be defending the US financial system, that is one of the most corrupt in the world (if not the most, when taking war mongering into account), but at the same time the best in the world at hiding and manipulating politicians and the media to divert attention away from what's truly happening.

Um, no the fed was created in high secrecy, on a private island by the big financiers of the day, like JP Morgan, and Rockefeller. More than 80% of ALL heads of the dozen federal reserve banks IN THEIR ENTIRE HISTORY are bankers, yet the Fed is supposed to serve the public. In point of fact, starting on January 1st, 2016, exactly 1/3 of all federal reserve heads will be executives from Goldman Sachs.
@_date: 2015-12-03 05:58:20


A lot of people are counting. You say "proceeds" like the money was returned to the people that the government is supposed to serve.
Congressmen and high profile politicians have gone on the [record]( to state that the Federal Reserve is a private organization, not a crown corporation, and in fact deeply affects government policies.
Glenn Beck said the same in a dedicated [episode]( and Fox fired him.
And another thing... you said:


Absolutely they did, but it will hit hardest in the near future. A country can not keep printing money, racking up unprecedented debt and not get burned. **The 2008 recession was an appetizer compared to what is coming.**  Bush ran up a deficit in the trillions, more than any president before him, then Obama has racked up a deficit more than any other president before him INCLUDING BUSH Jr.! Who do you think is going to pay all of this money back, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs? Scoffs, um no, taxes will go up, buying power will go down, benefits and pensions will either go down or will be lost despite the many years of millions of people working their arses off, faithfully paying into accounts every month, only to lose everything. Of course, one of the worst things to happen will be when the President orders banks to cap withdrawals when the national bank run happens, the stock markets crash, and all the USD everyone holds in their accounts will become near worthless. The Treasury / Federal Reserve lie can only last so long.

This is just arrogance, plain and simple. Altcoins were referred to as altcoins in the first couple of years after Bitcoin's release (2008-2010/2011). Most of the successful cryptocurrency’s were rewritten from the ground up, so are parallel platforms to BTC. New cryptocurrency platforms today are valuable in their own right, which complements Bitcoin adoption and awareness - not competes. Cryptocurrency platforms will take over niches to service industries that are ripe for disruption using this type of technology (read: most), and they will be identified by the industry they dominate and were designed to serve.

It's CPU agnostic, so it doesn't take thousands of server warehouses to mine. Proof of Importance in NEM is simply that harvesters are given a % rank relative to the network. However, rewards are random, this means you can mine XEM using a raspberry pi without issue because harvesters are paid from rewards with each mined block. The resources used seem to be RAM, but NEM doesn't seem to draw max RAM available. Anyway, it's GUI is very good as well -- dead simple to use, one button click to "start harvesting" for ex.

That original control theory blog brings me back, even more comprehensive than the [TechCrunch]( article from 2013. I just spent a few hours down the 'who dun it' research rabbit hole [again]. I think all the modules and codified conceptual solutions were from the works of many great minds, but Szabo put the finishing touches on the Bitcoin core, and [very effectively] anonymously launched it.

:-O how dare you come into the subreddit and say that this will all be one giant bubble! I challenge you to a dual, unhand me kind sir! ...but yes I agree, BTC is gonna pop in one spectacular fashion! lol
In all seriousness, Bitcoin is seeing stability, especially with countless implementations / clones of its blockchain, read Wall Street. However, BTC as a crypto will fall dramatically, especially with the bloc_size debacle, and my prediction of it settling much lower than its current valuation of about $250.

/user/kristkind is technically right: I don't think the PBOC tried to kill Bitcoin, they were manipulating the market. PBOC officials [unofficially met with bank execs]( denied having met them, or denied any official ban on bitcoin, which fuelled international rumours, and forcing huge bitcoin valuation swings, enabling massively profitable insider trading, but was more likely used for some kind of political leverage/power play.

*Most welcome! More powerful stuff:*
"This is going to be the hardest work you'll ever do," Hock said with his consultant hat on.
"Most of you will want to quit. And before it's over, quite a few of you will."
The Visa bylaws were designed for credit cards; they aren't transferable. For another, the world changes too fast, making detailed plans obsolete before you can implement them. No, he says: "Far better than a precise plan is a clear sense of direction and compelling beliefs. And that lies within you. The question is, how do you evoke it?"
Standard facilitator-babble?
Hardly, says MIT's Peter Senge, who has been through the process himself. "I first started taking Dee seriously when I heard him say, 'We spent a year developing a purpose and principles statement for Visa.' That's not window dressing," says Senge. "He really means you to blow up the whole organization. **He really wants you to dissolve the power relationships**  — everything."

Correct me if I'm wrong here, but:
If the block_size increases, that would mean more transactions per second, higher scaling down the road, great, BUT doesn't this also mean centralization will take place? Only companies and individuals with the capital to buy very fast computing rigs will be able to mine.

And your view is solely based on the show *Silicon Valley* it would seem. 
It's hard as shit to first of all build a profitable business and second, get VC or angel investor funded. Ideally you bootstrap and pay your own way, then you're not "indebted" to investors, but in either case, it's very stressful. 
Think 14 hour+ days, clients asking for adjustments and concessions, then investors do what feels like stringing along, but it's mere due diligence, they need to see a business plan at the very least, which in and of itself is quite a bit of work to complete [many startups don't even start writing a business plan, and if they do, it's half assed.] 
So you're wrong, what you describe is less than 1% of startups that get funded, and they're in the tail end, late adopter phase or buyout of their lifecycle.
The upshot to all of this is it's a highly character building endeavor.

Last I checked, you need to go to a bank and wire funds to an exchange, then buy bitcoin. In a way, this is irrelevant.

A ten minute time to process blocks could not feasibly be done in an in person remittance setting. The depositor gives you the cash, you scan it into your remittance app, then what, you ask the depositor to wait ten minutes to process? No way!

So before regulators knew that some scammers were going in and replacing real estate property pink slips with their own names, and according to the legal system, taking possession, you might ask this same question. Once lawyers - let's face it international - and regulations catch up with the crypto currency industry, this will be illegal, and those responsible should be locked up.
Imagine if your paycheques were being deposited to your bank account, and when you went to try and withdraw cash from the ATM, you were presented with endless blockages asking for more information before you could get your cash. On blatant problem is that these 'take your coins and keep them scams' keeps happening, it's a trend and goes against everything Bitcoin was originally created circumvent.

Yup, and some exchanges do it right like Poloniex: Allow $2,000 daily withdrawal limit, but if you ~want~ /need to step up to higher withdrawal sums, add more profile info to contribute to their KYC needs.
The base level is $60,000 per month, I don't mean to sound presumptuous, but if you have that much in your wallet/s, it's not a bad fraction-time job to semi-retire and have to withdraw $60,000/month in income.
Two other thoughts, if you're trying to skirt paying taxes, then I see their point of view, but for those who legitimately will pay taxes and enter personal info for an exchanges' KYC needs, then they could withdraw more each day.
2.) I don't argue privacy doesn't matter because it sure as hell does in today's online environment. What is required is more honest transparency from all sides,  government agencies, companies and individual customers.

I know most if not all of this sub-reddit users' hate Ripple, but the Ripple protofol is already being tested in the collossal Western Union global transfers network, so international digital wire transfers are already happening in the background, despite this authors claim of taking at least a decade to catch on.

Could you be more specific? Is Bitstamp forcing you to add more KYC info to your profile, are they allowing a reasonable daily withdrawal limit before KYC demands, or are you saying they are blocking reasonable withdrawals and feeding you BS PR speak emails?
I use Bitstamp, find them reasonable with one or two exceptions, but I'd consider changing exchanges if they're being dicks.
