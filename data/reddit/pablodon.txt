Thanks please do. It would probably be a good idea to show the USD value not just for the amount but also for the fee
@_date: 2017-02-06 17:49:38
That was the transaction

Yeah I just sent someone bitcoin and didn't realize my ledger nano s added a $10 fee :(
this was the transaction

I agree they are a good source and by far the biggest newspaper in Germany

I just saw that it has been added. Thank you so much ��

Proxies are usually not that reliable but a VPN should work

Ledger Nano S
@_date: 2017-08-05 00:55:05
Ok thank you. That's what I just did. I'm just asking because of the maximum deposit. So I'm making multiple orders to get around that. 
@_date: 2017-08-05 04:35:56
That's not how it works. The supply is not fixed. Supply is the amount you are willing to sell on an exchange.

That's not true. Just look at Spotify or Netflix. Most people would rather pay a small amount than deal with ads
@_date: 2016-09-18 09:24:09
Mostly convenience. It's easy to send and receive money on any computer even if it's been compromised.

I always get mad when subscription services make me wait for 6 confirmations when they could just accept 0 and cancel the subscription if necessary.

PayPal froze my account and kept all my funds for 6 months.

You can buy Amazon gift cards on there as well as other popular gift cards

Megaupload 2.0 where file transfers will be linked to a tiny Bitcoin micro transaction.
@_date: 2016-09-17 18:53:59
How long until we can actually use it?

Don't forget to buy a hardware wallet. Do not store your Bitcoin on your pc or any exchange
@_date: 2016-09-09 17:39:02
I have used it twice to buy stuff on Amazon without problems. It took them 2 weeks to upgrade my limits. But I rather spend USD or EUR at the moment and keep my Bitcoin

This might be a misunderstanding. Bitcoin itself is 100% safe. But the private key which is basically your password that gives you access to your bitcoin can be stolen. 
Just like your bank account or PayPal account can be hacked or compromised. The difference is that bank transactions and PayPal transactions are usually reversible but bitcoin transactions are final and more anonymous. That's why it is more dangerous to keep your crypto money on an online account. 
Keeping your coins stored on your computer is a bit safer but you could get a virus that steals your private key.
A hardware wallet is the best solution because it can't be hacked even when there is a virus on your computer. The hardware wallet is only designed to store your private key and to sign your transactions. Because the hardware wallet has a simple design there is very little room to tamper with it and no virus can get into it.

You can use Electrum to test the seed. 
That's what I did. I just got a new laptop last week so I gave it a try and it worked. Download electrum portable. Click recover and enter the seed. It will show your balance as well as all your transactions. After that make sure to delete electrum portable (including Recycle Bin)
Keep in mind though if your pc is compromised someone could steal your seed when you enter it. I recommend using either a new pc or if you have an old pc to install a fresh copy of Windows/Mac/Linux to be sure nothing has been compromised.

It depends how much you bought. Exchanges occasionally get hacked and the funds stolen. If you only bought a small amount like $100 it doesn't really matter. If you bought a bit more let's say $1000 I would recommend a wallet that supports two factor authentication like Electrum does. And if you bought even more I would get a hardware wallet like the Trezor or Ledger Nano S which cost about $60-100 but give you the highest security. 
And if you decide to stay with Circle make sure you turn on two factor authentication so no one can login to your account.
@_date: 2016-10-13 20:54:35
I had to learn it the hard way too. 2 Factor Authentication is a blessing and a must for emails and accounts with money

I think you are only buying/selling a BCC derivative on the exchange and not the actual asset. Just like you can buy BCC futures already.

It might not even be enough to pay for his tuition fees.

This has never happened before otherwise we would probably know. It could be an issue in the future but you shouldn't be paranoid.

What software is that?

Merry Christmas :)

That's how I do it:
Let's say you have a 24 words seed. Give half of your seed to your family and use a service for the other half e.g 
If you die your family gets an email with the other 12 words (if you don't login to the service for a month or so)
This seems pretty secure. Even if someone hacks the service or breaks into your house he is still missing 12 words.
