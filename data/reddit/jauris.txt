If you do ever want to buy stuff from Amazon, I'd suggest using gyft. You can buy giftcards with BTC and they have a sort of cash back system that BTC purchases earn 3x back on.

Sure thing, Keyboard Warrior.

Until you hit a certain threshold, iirc. Past a certain point there is no tax benefit I'm fairly sure.

I did, actually. Though my CPA and I took the route of them being assets, so I only had to pay gains on them when they were sold and I made a profit.

Nice! I'll be furnishing a new apartment pretty soon, and it looks like Overstock will be my go to place.

Well, yeah. Didn't most credit payment processors block them?

I like how being realistic somehow = bootlicking.

How about instead of being a cunt you just accept that people don't like and/or trust PDFs.

I would get in touch with a CPA (as I did), but essentially you'll be paying capital gains on any profit you make.

Ok, get back to me when you're done fighting the power. I think a recap of the results would be interesting.

Plus, imgur strips exif data automatically anyways.

For sure. I'm going to go get my taxes done tonight and I made sure to bring it up with my guy on the phone earlier.

To be fair to your dad, NYC was a very dangerous place up until very recently.

Yes, taxing you for the services you use every day is LITERALLY murder.

There's nothing wrong with hedging, especially when he took on such a high risk.

Yep: 
Merry Christmas!

Yep. I'm so extremely glad I made the investment that I did when I did. I didn't have that much debt left (15k ish), but with the rise of bitcoins over the last few days I've been able to make right around 22k in profit.
I guess now I can take another trip to Sweden like I've always wanted.
