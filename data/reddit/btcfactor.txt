What about Bitcoin Diamond? ;)
@_date: 2018-05-11 17:56:14
Why the Price ticker? Bitcoin is a global project and supposed to be a medium of exchange for planet earth. Hence, the '$' sign looks pretty odd and out of context.

This article reminded me of Fried Cat. Has anyone been able to trace him?

Yep ...among thousands of faucets which does not pay, it is one that really pays. I was paid :)

Sometimes I wish Bitcoin &amp; Bitcoin Cash supporters ceased to waste their energy by infighting and came together to fight thousands of scammy alts that are actually ruining the reputation of crypto among masses.

"anything can mean anything in Japanese" !!! OMG ...then how to propose a Japanese lady ? If I say "I Love U" ...she may get "I Hate U" depending on the context ?

 Was the voting link posted on [r/bitcoin]( while it was live?

Now we know... Satoshi Nakamoto = Dorian S. Nakamoto

But a lot of people at BitCoinTalk forum suggests these as mining alternative now a days. Their point is what costs a cent today will cost thousands of USD tomorrow if BTC price rises. So rather than buying BTC and taking risk, this is a safe option for newbies...
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:50:01
LoLz ...this is really intersting
@_date: 2014-07-20 13:58:49
Nice analysis... but I think the Winklevoss may come before Satoshi ;)
@_date: 2014-01-26 16:28:37
Thanks ...anyone tried it in person ?
@_date: 2014-11-26 20:09:46
Twitter account of the producers is  They liked the tweet about the doc link from CoinLearn.org. Check yourself =&gt;

hmm.... that is a nice learning though :)

How do u expect him to do that now ?

Welcome aboard to the world of Crypto. U may start off by playing in websites like  where u'll learn some interesting BTC Facts as well as earn some play money. Moreover this page will give u lot of common Q/A -  ....Feel free to ask any Q ot twitter

But, it is stuck there. Is it supposed to behave that way?
@_date: 2016-06-06 10:18:28
Tried with Tor. Throwing the following error...
[Error] Could not find IP.
@_date: 2016-06-06 12:03:16
U have made a pretty good analysis IMO. I think, market always tends to true price discovery in the long run. So, we need to know what becomes the true cost of the cheapest mining set up to mine 1 coin after the halvening happens.
@_date: 2016-12-22 19:34:55


True. For example, I've switched to [BestHostFree.com VPS]( as soon as they started to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:27:14
According to you, large miners could just collude under one pool to force difficulty up at which small miners wont get anything and will shut down eventually. But, I dont see this happening.
Large miners could also collude to have a 51% attack on the network. I dont see that happening either.
Some of you are so obsessed with technology, that you forget the economics part. Mining is now dominated by pools and any miner, small or big, can become part of a pool for mining irrespective of the block size.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:47:47
What about other dynamic proposals ?
e.g. 
@_date: 2015-08-25 20:28:39
Yep. Except that they will axe their own foot that way.

Did you even read the proposal or posting just by reading the reddit thread title ? Have you read the conditions being considered in the second proposal, that you are calling idiotic ? The parameters in the second proposal does not allow the max block size to go up in leaps &amp; bound. So, even if I consider, at some point of time, max block size has reached your imaginary 10GB, it is only possible when the previous blocks are close to it. That means, max block size will become a function of network's current capacity.
@_date: 2015-08-25 22:29:11
As far as my knowledge goes...
i. There is no provision in BIP 100 to reduce the max cap.
ii. BIP 100 proposes manual voting of miners through code. Manual voting might not be a good choice for automated scaling of a robust network. This invites manual errors to personal threats or bribery. Imagine if difficulty were chosen by manual voting.

1. If large miners join hand under a single pool, then the hash power of that pool will rise magnificently, thereby increasing the difficulty in next update.
2. So, large miners can add fake transactions, but pool operators can not! How come ? I dont get this logic.
3. Yes and this why the proposed algorithm does not negate the participation of small miners.

Do u think the 64MB RAM could be a barrier?

Can I run a Bitcoin full node with lightning on a Pentium III board?

I still dont understand, where is the DB in Ruby on Rails?
@_date: 2018-03-18 15:04:39
I have an old desktop computer with Pentium III motherboard &amp; 64 MB RAM. Thought it can be used for a cause...
@_date: 2019-01-31 20:10:33


Crypto is great. But, it is weak &amp; feeble in front of lynching mob or armed violence. No medium of exchange will ever have the power to extinct races. You are misinformed.
@_date: 2018-03-20 19:22:35
1. Can a 40GB external HD be used for this purpose?
2. Can a lightning node operator earn anything substantial?

Ok. So, its in China?
@_date: 2018-03-18 20:31:09
Google saying that its in US, but he is saying its in China. Now, I'm confused as fuck! Does both of these countries have a place of same name?

From this thread on Bitcointalk, it seems many Bangladeshi people are actually involved in Bitcoin -

Does it mean that after being assigned a BIP no., we'll get to see BIP 1xx &amp; BIP xx under  or there is another round of pinging process for that ?
