have a link to the CFTC approval please?
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:55:02
agree. all the OTC trading screws any real chance at TA. TA works a little until a whale buys OTC and dumps on an exchange..
@_date: 2018-09-24 01:53:01
yes. still such a young system, humans will/have to find its limits on both ends almost immediately. the ole going for the gusto... 
@_date: 2018-09-01 23:21:58
same as housing loans etc..just tokenize them too (well only the bad ones)
@_date: 2018-09-25 18:47:27
heres an interesting article. mayber the tax code for cyrptos about to change in the US at least. 
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:38:30
now almost guarantee Bakkt will get delayed by CFTC. simply because it would completely screw the CBOE if Bakkt ame out BEFORE VanEck ETF. it would render the ETF impotent.
@_date: 2018-09-01 23:20:54
The U.S. will just tokenize its inflation and open it up to global markets so the world can buy em just like alot of the other $hitcoins.
@_date: 2018-09-20 13:35:15
everyone knows you 'buy the dip'...
@_date: 2018-09-20 23:36:00
its not about ICE being prepared. its the good ole boys club needing to place nice with each other.  
@_date: 2018-09-20 22:47:27
now to see how the market reacts
@_date: 2018-09-06 00:13:32
haven't seen Elliott Wave Redux guy either..
@_date: 2018-09-19 23:36:36
All the OTC trading has made TA a joke for a long time now as well. no way to track those trades and they happen to be the BIGGEST trades as far as volume. Just us retail suckers using exchanges to buy/sell. 
@_date: 2018-08-16 21:21:02
so whats the plan, hang out around 6200-6700 until there is more adoption? or the tech improves? OR do we have to wait for more etf &amp; custodian news to move the price? 
@_date: 2018-08-16 23:47:12
day 
@_date: 2018-09-20 14:09:26
haha good deal. I was being kinda funny, referencing the youtube vid 'BTFD Buy the Dip'.
@_date: 2018-08-10 21:44:17
yes currently a completely irrational marketplace atm. If everyone knew just how big these things will impact the space... (im not talking to the people already here)
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:32:06
Im def no Sherlock Holmes but the fact that they denied ALL the others AHEAD OF TIME and not the VanEck fund says to me it will get the nod.
@_date: 2018-08-11 12:58:36
i understand. i was being a smart-ass.
@_date: 2018-08-11 02:52:06
tether got that all messed anyway
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:33:03
or manipulate it any way they (anonymous) feel with that amount of coins
@_date: 2018-08-10 16:02:31
honeslty tho, its still should be a nice fall (as in time of the year) for BTC.
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:18:14
This looks pretty cool: 
Will prolly give coinbase a run. We need more sites to fiat back n forth. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:36:17
Reading that article I would like to see a denial on ProShare ETF. I can wait longer for Van-Eck.
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:44:01
When we hit Oct 11th, the horseshit of btc needs to reset to 3k-4k before real gains &amp; money comes back in should be over. Oct 12th 2017 BTC hit over 5k and hasnt looked back. Soon no one can say well btc was only 'X'k this time last year. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 21:06:26
75% denial
25% delay
0% approval
its like everyone already has that intuitive feeling that Van-Eck is going to get he 1st ETF anyway. Even tho they all have different parameters. Most likely Van-Eck will get delayed again as well. Was Sept 30., prolly hear a week before that they are delaying again. The market will react negatively...again (even tho most already have that intuition that says an ETF will eventually get approved...)
PS. Notice they haven't jumped out in front of the Aug 23rd date for Proshares to say delay like they did with Van-Eck... Thats one of the reasons i picked 75% denial. Also notice no hype or fomo with 3 days left for decision. Just my take on it.
@_date: 2018-08-07 23:13:58
what r the odds you bought a stock at 220 bucks a share in 2015 and its worth 6746 bucks a share TODAY? ...yes even with splits...
@_date: 2018-08-16 00:11:37
good ole American SEC pissing around and pissing around until they lose the initiative...
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:58:28
@_date: 2018-08-07 00:42:31
not that kind of manipulation.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:46:22
lol nice
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:07:13
One more time pls. How is this (Proshares)ETF getting approved good for bitcoin? Still no bitcoin being held for the fund right? Or settlement in bitcoin. Just using futures. If it does get approved, will it really raise the price? It may get approved just for the fact that its using existing futures. Just keeps money from actually coming into Bitcoin. A lot different then the Van-Eck proposed ETF.
@_date: 2018-08-22 20:35:50
so exactly when does this Elliott Wave model no longer apply?? when btc hits zero??
@_date: 2018-08-21 01:13:08
thats freakin awesome haha looks like thats 2 huge dumps absorbed by hidden buy walls in the last hour muahahaha
@_date: 2018-08-21 19:39:19
lol they already setting it up... "oops the maintenance took longer than we thought" 
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:30:51
Quick Question. Im sure been asked a bunch. Just saw someone pose this question in another forum and it went crickets. You think the SEC will ever approve an ETF for bitcoin knowing that anonymous satoshi wallets holding million bitcoins could tank the market anytime they felt like it?? 
@_date: 2018-08-19 20:11:06
boots on the ground. nice work.
@_date: 2018-08-22 01:04:42
@_date: 2018-08-24 01:03:55
Also, this makes too much sense. an ETF is imminent.
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:12:32
Im interested. Do you accept bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:27:54
honestly may dip more tomorrow when mainstream gets the etf news.
@_date: 2018-08-23 02:22:19
was thinking Bakkt in Nov. to carry excitement til jan.-feb. for VanEck
@_date: 2018-08-09 04:15:44
wouldnt it be crazy if once all these etfs, custodian services, indexes etc are all in place by the big boys, they petition reg bodies like the sec to put a halt on all OUR trading on exchanges like binance etc?? to get the regular peeps outta the market and force everyone to be accredited at certain various levels to invest in their products.
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:09:18
i live in maine. robnhood may get maine by 2020 lol this state not exactly a priority.
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:59:34
4hr candle gonna close green :)
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:17:58
will be redic
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:23:52
im still learning. so they are not buying &amp; holding actual bitcoin with this ETF either? futures suck for that reason alone. money that could be coming into actual bitcoin is being put into futures and settled for cash instead.. 
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:23:46
Should we wait for more good news to come out this week so it can drop to around 5k before buying more? Funny how btc survived and actually held fairly strong thru all that SEC, CFTC, China, Korea, India FUD earlier this year..
@_date: 2018-08-21 03:56:38
your correct, i printed sheet with all the etfs coming up 23rd thru sept 30th. like 9 of them.  got mixed up.  So ill change my answer to 100% denial.
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:32:29
or delay then nod..
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:10:39
didnt care for the name either, just thought the 'round up' when using your card was a cool idea.
@_date: 2018-08-14 13:02:09
the last comment :)
@_date: 2018-08-14 02:03:17
@_date: 2018-08-23 00:28:12
Anyone have the short on how the VanEck proposed ETF is solving the issues that Graniteshares could not and was disapproved for? esp. the "markets of significant size' part. Or is that based on old info from when the etf was first proposed?
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:08:27
the truth
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:55:38
do you have a link to that SEC statement? Didnt think that kind of thing was under the SEC's perview.
@_date: 2018-08-11 01:05:41
some really dont have much of a choice but to hodl at this point i would think. 
@_date: 2018-08-20 20:56:48
@_date: 2018-08-10 15:42:41
If etf gets approved at least btc wll only drop a little. if they get denied it will drop a lot. lol
@_date: 2018-08-16 13:27:05
With future expiry yesterday i expected to see at least a little bump in up volume....
@_date: 2018-08-24 00:57:13
yes Bitmex didnt help the situation the other night.
@_date: 2018-08-05 02:32:33
yeah or Bah Habba
@_date: 2018-08-14 15:50:48
some stuff to think about, thanks, appreciate you taking the time. 
@_date: 2018-08-24 14:11:29
its not Bitcoin Bens project but YES he promotes it lol
@_date: 2018-08-25 00:27:10
congrats! your still early to the party :) they say there are more millionaires in the world than available whole bitcoins in circulation. Wait til that war starts lol. You'll be staring at your 1 BTC (..or more) certificate hanging on the wall with a big ole crap eatin grin.
@_date: 2018-08-21 20:17:04
lol a few short whales tried it last night, was fun to watch that bulls hidden buy wall suck em all up! was a nice battle until shorty ran out of btc to dump and started borrowing to try an force the short. what ya think he/she/they LOST last night? 2mil, 5mil, 10mil? most VOLUME in a long time and barely moved the price :)
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:32:17
love the sarcasm. it brings a certain depth to the daily discussion hahaha
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:40:51
also projects like Bakkt, Fidelity getting in place BEFORE Dec triple witching so as to give investment groups the NEW ASSET CLASS as an option for 2019. Then the BTC halving in 2020 as well.
@_date: 2018-10-17 22:27:30
Toyota Supra :)
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:06:27
also talks about onboading &amp; testing in Nov, trading starts Dec. 
@_date: 2018-10-14 03:12:55
lol now that's damn funny man. Shit, crypto has made a liar out of EVERYONE at one point or another...
@_date: 2018-10-05 19:20:22
imo anyone who invested in BTC doesn't really care about the fiat they spent on it anyway, 5-10 is fine by me.
@_date: 2018-10-28 00:27:30
trading into stablecoins are not TAXABLE events, trading back and forth into USD are.
@_date: 2018-10-11 01:18:47
good call. perfect timing.
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:05:39
Look at Bakkt's twittter. titled: Our team, launch &amp; advocacy. Lays it out pretty well including the bullet point * requirement for full prefunding for all bitcoin trades.
@_date: 2018-10-18 16:24:10
OIC what you mean. Good question. Just a guess on my part, probably similar to coinbase, they add a small % to the buy &amp; take a small % for the sale but yeah nowhere does it say WHAT the fees will be.
@_date: 2018-10-18 15:11:32
there will undoubtedly be a certain amount of FOMO once the price starts to really move. apprehension will hit when we get back around last dec price. agree it could be 2019 which will screw with everyone's mind that was here for last dec run lol (thinking it has to be timed just like last year)
@_date: 2018-10-05 22:21:28
not the money they spent on BTC. I wouldn't recommend spending money on BTC you really care about. That way if someone like kangarooFeet was right, it wouldn't really matter anyway.
@_date: 2018-06-22 15:50:40
there simply isn't enough NEW MONEY being poured in atm...
@_date: 2018-11-04 00:29:58
comments deadline is the 5th. they will rule sometime after the 5th.
@_date: 2018-11-27 05:02:30
so we are about due for that OTHER piece of perfectly timed FUD, where is it? what will it be? been waiting on that kick ya in the nuts while your down FUD from a fake SEC article etc. maybe it'll be, Bloomberg says Pres Trump dumps crypto..
@_date: 2018-11-14 15:55:59
@_date: 2018-11-08 16:18:43
Fing whales CANNOT stand to leave a couple hundred bucks on the table.....the ole, "i better get it befre someone else does" mentality gets so old. They would be happy to leave it right here. 6000-6700 as long as they are making that money monthly.
@_date: 2018-07-27 01:06:30
@_date: 2018-07-27 00:09:18
CBOE completely different animal when talking about who is going to INSURE the ETF. One thing for sure, if THEY get dissapproved, forget about bitcoin etfs for now.
