Two months and counting here. I've given up.

Lost access to my account last October. Sent dozens of emails to customer support, always get the same copy+paste form reply back even when I start my message explaining point for point why that reply is unhelpful.
I've never once gotten a person on their phone line.
My account has a zero balance, so I gave up after two months of constant attempts to get someone to care. It would be nice to have my exact purchase history for tax purposes, but I know it close enough to estimate. I'm just going to take my business elsewhere.

Sorry to say, but join the club. I haven't had access to my account in two months. My two factor token stopped working and one particular step of the standard form response for that issue doesn't work for me (a certain button is simply not available where they say it will be). They've disabled directly emailing their support email, including replying to messages you receive from it, and the only way to reply is to visit a support page listing your open tickets - the page requires logging in to view. So every time I send a new support ticket and get the same broken form reply, I can't even explain why I need additional help and of course they never actually read the request. You just get the standard reply for the category you picked. I don't currently have any bitcoin on my Coinbase account so I've decided just to write it off.

I have the exact same issue. Waiting weeks for a response from support.

Exact same situation. I asked them to cancel my order this week and was told it would be shipping next week. Not the response I was looking for but if you're still hoping to get yours soon maybe it's good news.

Just what it says. I visited that link and a word doc downloaded automatically. I assume containing some form of malicious macro. Whether that's from the site itself or a malicious advertiser I can't say.
