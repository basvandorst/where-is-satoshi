This is the correct answer a currency that is not used as a currency but only to dump other currency into is an investment not a currency.

What? I don't understand what this post is meant to say. Is the price like this right now? Do you want it to go to that? Hold at that? Less is often more. In this case more information would have been helpful.

Probably lost his house due to debt from Bitcoin.

But you do realize that the new rules would be beneficial to everyone, right and that they are needed so Lightning can be activated? Lower Fees are in everyone's best interest(except maybe miners)
@_date: 2017-08-24 21:02:55
This is my biggest issue with Bitcoin as a future all around currency. The max number of 21million can already not be achieved anymore because people delete them by accident. At first this is not a problem. More like yeah that's great means my bitcoins are worth more. But if that happens over and over. With the cap it means bitcoin has a limited lifetime from the get go. Until people won't use it anymore because the fractions of bitcoin that are a reasonable amount of worth are just crazy. Like 1E-40 or something even worth.

Segwit is activated on Litecoin and has been for month no issues there as far as I can tell so that Testing issue seems to be a non starter. However I can understand the Problem people have with it being done in this way.

I think I got a good question that would get you two to the point where a discussion is possible. Also I am new to this subreddit so don't rip md head off. 
How is Btc1 trying to brick all the bitcoin nodes/kill the bitcoin network?
@_date: 2017-08-25 14:24:09
Well segwit is a prerequisite(or atleast close to a prerequisite) for lightning and with lightning buying coffee with bitcoin would be a lot more sensible than now. Although miners would disagree in some way(I actually would be interested to see how they would mask their dislike of lower fees) considering they will not have as much income anymore.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:48:15
Thats a cool Idea. Though the question remains is it efficient enough at both tasks(heating and mining) to be economical.
@_date: 2018-11-07 11:10:00
It really isn't. But seeing a post like this once a week is a nice like that young nephew that shows his newest drawing off. Adoption will come but definetively not like that
@_date: 2018-03-26 17:49:48
Well we could ask the 19th century worker what they are thinking about that. I don't think that approach is really better.
@_date: 2018-03-15 15:18:52
Absolutely agreed. The issue is financial illiteracy as you put it.
@_date: 2018-03-27 08:40:36
Yes. I agree. And also this would be a good example on how to approach the subject in comparison to OP. You have made your argument gave reason and even included a source to back up your opinion. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 07:53:24
It has been falling this week. It might half within a year. So it's an uncertain time to start investing.
Giving financial advice in such a matter isn't really helpful. Especially without any reasoning why you think it might double within a year. I am not saying it can't double within a year, just saying with bitcoin displayed volatility it is very much uncertain what may or may not happen next or in a year. I think for bitcoin only a very long position is a reasonably good investment. For example 3 years at the minimum to filter out the volatility.

I mean that if you take money rules to extremes you end up supporting the subjugation of the working class. I am split on the subject of direct democracy because an error in educating the electorate can have terrible consequences(not to mention those people that vote without getting themselves informed) most politicians can normally(excluding the US for now) not be called uneducated.
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:08:43
Well let me elaborate. I dont have anything against hodling it is always a more sustainable thing to be on a long position. But I still think that even when you are just hodling it should be reason behind it. You know like: I think the downfall is happening because of this issue which will resolve itself in a time that is irrelevant for me. SO basically my argument was more about the "blind" part.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:30:27
Nice. A corporate state without real oversight. Great idea circumvent the politicians and just let the "associations" directly make policy. Fantastic idea. What you would do with that proposal is not separate state from money but introduce money to a whole new level of power. Normally government is funded by taxes which are non biased in and of itself how they are applied not so much but they are taxes and they are not bound to political favor. The issue with money and state is campaigning. What needs to happen is that the campaigning needs to be cut from outside money. There need to be rules on how much air time a campaign gets which needs to be the same as every opponent now you run into the problem who is a serious candidate and who is not. That should be done completely without using money. And only by signatures being collected by unpaid volunteers(limited in number according to the election type)  and then every candidate should get the same  funds from taxes as well to ensure no lobbying has taken place. That would separate money from state much more effectively than your idea, atleast IMHO.
@_date: 2018-03-16 14:38:46
Yes. Obviously the two are connected. Not wanting to be shot by the outcast classmate and cryptocurrency. And some people still wonder why the normal people think cryptopeople are weird.
@_date: 2018-03-15 18:12:50
At first I was like nooo that cant be right, I just spent 5minutes looking through r/bitcoin but yeah you are right think this is actually this weeks low point.
@_date: 2018-02-10 15:53:00
And the connection is?
@_date: 2018-03-01 08:36:16
That title is terrible.
That has been obvious for month. And since this is the second time this happened no one is really wondering.
@_date: 2018-03-15 14:00:36
I think you are part of the problem the guy is completely right. This Lambo moon and blind hodling going on is what makes the rest of humanity not take bitcoin seriously. That's why it takes so long for it to go mainstream, Normal people seeing crypto morons doing/saying something stupid.
@_date: 2017-09-21 13:21:13
Don't encourage something like this. Investing in Bitcoin is not a safe bet. It is risky especially in the short term. For private persons it is a general rule of investment to not invest money you are not prepared to lose. Investing money you do not have is beyond crazy. Bitcoin as a long term investment is a great idea but not when you need to take out a loan to do it.
And if that was supposed to be sarcasm. You know this is the internet you need to have /sarcasm atleast at the end.

Technically he is poised to being president of the parliament that post is not part of the government in Germany. He will be in charge of agenda for the parliament and enforce the house rules on every member of parliament, including the government.
@_date: 2017-09-09 22:57:10
You assume that short sighted capitalism is at work. That is always a good bet, however there may come a point when too many bitcoins are not in circulation anymore because they were destroyed or something and the currency is on the brink of being irrelevant. The majority of bitcoin-owners might vote to break that limit to not have to actually pay in 1E-25ers of bitcoin. Because there may come the point were the normal person won't understand that 1E-25 is actually a lot worse than 1E-24 etc.
@_date: 2018-02-21 23:22:54
That's easy I go on here once a day and unless this sub is even worse than the cluster of mayhem it normally is, I don't check the price.
@_date: 2017-10-18 22:40:55
I don't think this will truly be an issue. The purpose of bitcoin was never getting rich but having a currency that is not controlled by a government which could fuck it up. And that's just the first benefit that comes to mind. Bitcoin is not going to stay an investment forever. It will get to be a currency. No one discusses that it would have been great to buy Euro when it first entered the market compared to now. Once you deprive yourself of the investment angle you put on bitcoin that becomes a lot more clear.
@_date: 2018-04-17 10:04:32
It really isn't:
No one is backing it?
" is backed by people just like Gold."
(this one is fine I would say and was the first time it got me thinking about that part so hats off)
It is not widely accepted?
" is accepted by retailers around the globe."
(Bitcoin isn't widely accepted yet it may be accepted by some retailers but that doesn't make it widely accepted.)
Users are not protected?
" makes people in-charge of their funds."
(doesn't answer the question)
It is too volatile?
" is inflation proof money."
(doesn't change the volatility that Bitcoin does display)
@_date: 2018-04-17 11:59:54
US Dollar is accepted by far more retailers around the World than bitcoin making it widely accepted. And in the US it is the state currency. And CNY is considered money outside of China aswell it just doesnt need to be accepted by retailers. However just as an example as BTC and USD, CNY even though none of those are the official currency in Germany all three are accepted at quite a few businesses at the Kudamm in Berlin. 
That would have been a better answer than what was given in the tweet. 
So what you are saying is that bitcoin is saying but USD is volatile. Sure USD and every other currency has inflation. Which is exactly what Bitdoin could fight as you say, however right now Bitcoin is not the stable antiinflation haven it can be. The volatility is there. Saying it isn't is just stubbornness. Accepting that Bitcoin for now is volatile is just that... fact.  If you need more convincing that bitcoin is volatile in value just compare BTC/USD  with USD/EUR and BTC/EUR.
