Bitcoin is the most important cryptocurrency.  That said, there will always be others, because we live in a free world, and people are allowed to, and will themselves, create new alternatives.  That’s what Charlie did by creating Litecoin.  He didn’t create it to intentionally steal attention away from bitcoin, even though some people think that’s what’s happening now.  
I still think it’s great that bitcoin is limited to 21 million, and that’s one of the biggest reasons why I’m a supporter of bitcoin.  There will always be other altcoins, and I can’t stop that.  Many will go away, and some will stay, which is fine.

We don’t have any plans to release a debit card.
I think it’s great to see that the CNY will now be included in the SDR basket by the IMF.  That’s such a significant milestone for the RMB currency, and great for China in general.  I look forward to the day when bitcoin is introduced into the SDR basket, and I think that day will come sooner that people realize.

Bitcoin is a decentralized payment network that allows transactions to be processed in a trustless fashion.  It’s accomplished by having a worldwide group of computers (miners as resources) protecting the ledger (blockchain) through mathematical proofs (cryptography).  The blocks are limited in size, so there will always be a limit in how many transactions you can fit into a block. 
For the first 7 years of bitcoin, the size of the block was limited to 1 MB (similar to the storage size of a floppy disk from the 1980’s!).  Now, we’re running into that limit, and would like to see the block size increased, so that more people can use bitcoin globally.  A 1 MB floppy disk size limit is certainly not enough, but what is?  How will it impact everyone using bitcoin and those running mining hardware to protect the network?  Who should make the decision?  Is it a popular vote?  Or decision by committee?  These are the hard questions.
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:42:27
This is both important and hard to do.  Trading volumes are so easily faked, and it’s unfortunate that many people (and websites) still naively trust the trading volumes published by exchanges.  Unfortunately, I don’t see a straightforward answer to this.  I should sit down with Charlie and talk more about this, and see what we can do.  Thanks for suggesting that.  
In the end, trust is so important.  I urge all of my friends and family to only use the most reliable bitcoin companies.  And of course, BTCC and Coinbase are my favorites.

Are you asking about the AliPay service by Alibaba?  No, we don’t have any plans to release any service integrations with AliPay.
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:57:04
All of them! However, it’s hard to predict the exact time.  At BTCC, we’re working hard to bring to the world the best, the most convenient and trustworthy digital currency services.  We started with a bitcoin exchange, and have added wallets, merchant payments, mining pool, and new blockchain services.  There’s more to come for sure, and we’ll let the market decide what sticks and what’s best.
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:58:38
I’m a big fan of bitcoin because it’s a true digital asset; I think it’s amazing, and we have yet to reach the full potential.  Blockchain is very important and fundamental to bitcoin, but personally, I’m a bit skeptical about private blockchains, or maybe that I don’t fully understand what exactly they’re pushing for.  To me, a private blockchain should just be a private database, or one that is shared by a group of people.  It’s not open, meaning, outsiders don’t have the right to participate, and need permission.  The most important aspect about bitcoin is that participation is open, meaning that anyone can choose to participate by adding hashing power to mine bitcoin, without needing a license or anything!
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:34:27
Thanks for asking!  People ask me about bitcoin and litecoin all the time, and I always give them the same answer: bitcoin is more important.  It’s the world’s first real digital asset, the first real cryptocurrency that’s viable for everyone to use!  And the best way to get bitcoin into every country is more education and awareness.  Today, the biggest challenge facing bitcoin is awareness and understanding; most people still don’t fully understand what makes cryptocurrencies so special, as it’s still too mysterious and difficult to understand.
Down the road, when bitcoin is in more widely used, I naturally expect more governments to start regulating it.  And that’s especially true for bitcoin exchanges, as exchanges are by definition a centralized entity holding customer funds, so security and trust is paramount.  Regulation of exchanges is both necessary and prudent.
I’d love to have Charlie with us at BTCC!  But since he’s living in California, Coinbase is not a bad choice either.  :-)  We’re all in the same industry, pushing bitcoin ahead, so it’s all good!
My favorite OS is Mac OS X.  I like it because it’s based on BSD Unix.  
In terms of cryptocurrencies, I think it’s just bitcoin and Litecoin, right?  ;-)
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:09:54
BTCC has been using bank accounts in China for a long time.  It didn’t happen overnight a few weeks ago, nor did PBOC give any “green light” recently.  I think there was some miscommunication or misunderstanding from the press when that story got spread.  Our customer deposits are all held in bank accounts, and that has always been the case.
@_date: 2015-12-03 02:19:29
Besides bitcoin, I also own litecoin, and it’s because Charlie gave me some.  :-)
@_date: 2015-12-03 01:36:56
If asked to choose, I would prefer BIP 100, and the main reason is that I think blocksize increases should be moderate and made with deliberate care and attention.  It would be too aggressive to adhere to a fixed schedule of increase, given that network bandwidth does not improve as fast as storage capacity.  If you think about it, block sizes affect two things:  storage (the blockchain stored on your hard disk) and networking bandwidth (the sending around of blocks during confirmations).  Historically, these two have both increased very fast, similar to Moore’s law, but the rates of increase has been dramatically different.  So what will happen in 20 years?  So we need to find the right tradeoff in deciding the block size.
I’m looking forward to attending Scaling Bitcoin in Hong Kong!  I really wanted to attend the Montreal event, but couldn’t get away for that.  
For the BTCC Mining Pool, you’re right, we need to go sweep and update all the configs so that mine the latest version blocks.  Thanks for catching that.

I started BTCC by partnering with my co-founders, who created BTCChina in early 2011.  That was the first bitcoin exchange in China, and also the most successful.  Since we were all very passionate about this space, and wanted to bring bitcoin to everyone, we immediately got along and decided to join forces.  Starting a bitcoin exchange is easy and hard.  The idea is simple, the technology is difficult, and not impossible to overcome.  The most important aspect is to have the passion and the determination to succeed.  Regardless of what you do, make sure it’s in a field that you’re passionate about, and you’ll find yourself very motivated to succeed.  Good luck!

There’s a huge difference between how things currently are, versus what restrictions are truly in place. The former does not imply the latter.
This is what I mean: Even if most dog and cat owners are female, that doesn’t mean that only women are allowed to have dogs and cats as pets -- men can also go out and get dogs and cats as pets.  
The same principle applies to bitcoin mining and ASIC manufacture: Even if most miners and ASIC makers are in China, that doesn’t mean that only Chinese people are allowed to do that. You, regardless of your nationality, gender, age, and geographic location can also go out and acquire the hardware needed to do your own bitcoin mining. You can even design and manufacture your own ASICs. All it takes is hard-work and dedication, which is definitely NOT exclusive to China.
If miners are refusing to adopt Segwit, then that’s what it is. That has nothing to do with whether or not they are Chinese. Just remember that you (and anyone else) can go out and acquire your own bitcoin mining hardware and gather enough hashing power to make SegWit activation happen.

BTCC Pro Exchange is run by BTCC, which is based in Hong Kong. The CNY/BTC Spot Exchange is run by BTCChina, which is based in China. These are two separately-run companies in two different jurisdictions. Due to regulatory reasons, we’ve had to make the distinctions clear, and cannot offer transfers and functionality across companies and across jurisdictions.The price ceiling and price floor are automatically adjusted on BTCC Pro Exchange; I’ll go ask the team to look into it to see if we can make it adjust more frequently. Thanks for the feedback!
Thanks, 
@_date: 2017-02-18 19:12:33
Yes, for sure! As I’ve said in the past, I’m supportive of first activating Segwit then moving on to roll out a real hardfork for a real block size increase. I hope all of that can happen in 2017!

As much as I would *like* to see that happen, unfortunately, I currently don’t see any evidence of central banks or national governments buying bitcoins yet.  I expect that it will happen one day.  It’ll probably start with some of the smaller countries.

I hope so but, honestly, I don’t track litecoin on a daily basis. We’re facing tremendous pushback from governments in getting digital currencies to revolutionize finance. Getting bitcoin to win is hard enough, and I’m focused on doing that first.

I cannot predict the future, but I do hope that SegWit will get activated.
@_date: 2017-02-18 19:50:55
I actually don’t know the answer to your first question.
On your second and third questions, it all comes down to education and convincing people. It is hard to educate people about complicated topics, and it takes an exponentially larger amount of time when more people are involved. Bitcoin is already complicated. SegWit and the scaling debate are even harder and more complicated. We need more time for better communication and understanding.

I think Mobi has great potential. You’ll have to use it to get a feel for that potential. It’s a mobile-first hosted wallet that’s just based on a mobile number. With Mobi, for the first time ever, anyone in the world with a smartphone can now receive and hold bitcoins by using just their phone number. You can also send any kind of money to anyone with just their mobile number. You can send bitcoins, or choose from any of the dozens of currencies Mobi has available. Go get it here: 
Mobi will naturally track and convert BTC into/from fiat, and includes a complementary VISA debit card.  As for the actual transfers of cash and physical currencies (or goods and services), we leave it up to the users. We envision Mobi to have integrations with various bitcoin exchanges around the world, to make all of that even easier for users.  
The end goal is to have Mobi help Make Bitcoin Great Again.  :-)

There are a couple different reasons. I think it has to do with culture and with how the software industry got started and evolved in China. It also may just be time, we need more time for open source development to catch up in China. I’m not too concerned or worried about this.

Hi u/Calvinex, 
BTCC, which operates Pro Exchange, is a Hong Kong company, and is not affected by mainland China regulation.
Bitcoin price on BTCC Pro Exchange is around 6% higher than other markets. As a result, some customers who have long positions cannot close their positions — there aren't enough buyers and they cannot be matched. 
We're introducing a new fee structure ( in order to slowly lower the price premium, which previously was as high as 11.5%. 
If we had manually lowered the price by decreasing the price band, long positions would have been liquidated immediately. By allowing the price band to decrease slowly, we are protecting customers' positions. 
We project that by March 19th, the price premium on BTCC Pro Exchange will be low enough to allow most orders to be matched.
Please bear with us while we make these changes to transition BTCC Pro Exchange to a more sustainable and healthy market. 
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:18:05
Great question...  You can certainly ask me, but unfortunately, I don’t work for the PBOC, so I can’t possibly know exactly what they want, nor can I answer for them.  :-)
If I had to guess, I would say that they want what’s good for China. They have many things on their plates, and this year, they’ve started looking into bitcoin exchanges in China to give us their feedback on how to make our industry safe, and to comply with KYC, AML, and many other important regulations and best practices.
Thanks,

Mobi is different from Xapo in that we support 100+ currencies, so for the debit card, if you have money in your USD wallet, the card will deduct funds from the USD wallet for purchases.

This is something we considered, but we decided not to implement it this way. The reason is that we don’t want to expose your Mobi funds if your Twitter account is hacked.

We will continue to explore how to improve Twitter integration in Mobi. Please let us know if you have good ideas!

As members of this community, we are all sad to see the current deadlock in the scaling debate. Even though bitcoin’s price has come down from the ATH, I personally do not think it will go below USD $500.
The great thing about Mobi is that our customers can choose to convert their funds to a fiat currency value if they think bitcoin price is too volatile. Mobi users can convert their bits to another currency at any time by simply dragging-and-dropping within the app. We think this is a killer feature, as it allows people to use familiar currencies in a mobile app on their smartphone.
Thanks, 
Bobby 
@_date: 2017-02-18 18:15:04
My opinion is that the industry worldwide should first focus on bitcoin.  Yes, altcoins may have some exciting features, but it’s hard enough to get bitcoin adopted. In my opinion, bitcoin will lead digital currencies in revolutionizing finance.  We need to work hard to get bitcoin accepted in mainstream society first!
I’ve not heard many requests for “privacy-focused” altcoins from the Chinese community.  I think bitcoin already strikes the right balance between transparency and privacy with its pseudo-anonymous features.

No confirmation notification is sent to Mobi users when they send money to someone on Twitter. All money sent through Mobi to Twitter users will be automatically accepted into the recipient's account if the recipient is a Mobi user that has already connected their Twitter account to Mobi. If the recipient is not a Mobi user, then the receiver has seven days to claim the money. If the recipient has not claimed the funds after seven days, then the funds will be returned to the sender and the sender will be notified of the refund. (The same applies when a Mobi user sends funds to a mobile number whose owner has not yet registered for Mobi.)

We integrated Twitter into Mobi to make Mobi the defacto global payment platform that allows anyone to send money to anyone else in bitcoin and in any other fiat currency value. 
With Mobi, you can send money to any of the 2 billion smartphone users worldwide regardless of whether or not they have Mobi installed. The same applies for Twitter: with Mobi, you can send money to any of the 320 million Twitter users worldwide, regardless of whether or not they have Mobi installed.
To send to Twitter accounts, you need to connect your Twitter account to your Mobi app (under Me -&gt; Profile). You can then send money to any other Twitter account and the recipient will see your Tweet (or DM if you’re both already following each other). The recipient can download and run Mobi if they don’t already have an account; they'll instantly see the funds in their Mobi account.
We will continue to explore ideas for supporting more social media and communications platforms. Please give us your suggestions!

We give users a buy and sell rate for currency conversions on Mobi. The spread is very small, much lower than what banks and money exchangers charge. Behind the scenes, once your currencies have been exchanged, we use a proprietary algorithm to hedge our bitcoins and currencies on the global market in a way that reflects users’ balances in various currencies.

The Mobi Visa debit card is currently denominated in USD. We are looking into making it available in other currencies, such as EUR and GBP.

I certainly agree that the perception is that miners and Bitcoin Core developers have a contentious relationship. I think the problem comes down to miscommunication. Facilitating communication between miners and developers is a tough problem: there are hundreds of developers and hundreds of miners around the world, all living in different countries, with different languages and cultural norms, and across many time zones. No wonder it’s so hard for everyone to be on the same page!  
The solution is to have more face-to-face meetings with the help of translators, and work together so that everyone better understands everyone’s ideas and concerns. I have faith that the whole community of users, miners, developers, and industry companies actually all want the same thing, which is for bitcoin to succeed. The actual ideas and methods that different people have to reach this end may be different at times, but through trust, cooperation and some compromise, I strongly believe we can succeed as a community.
Thanks,

Hi cryptobubble,
Sales for BTCC Mint are going very well!  Hopefully, we'll continue doing this for the long term.  I think physical bitcoins is a very important market for Bitcoin and digital currencies in general, as it makes the product tangible for everyday use, in daily conversations and interactions, and most importantly, it makes Bitcoin instantly accessible to literally everyone.
In terms of how long this continues, I cannot predict.  If demand stops, then the business cannot continue obviously.  And we will also need clarify from regulation perspective.  and lastly, since our current line-up uses freshly mined coins, those are always of a limited supply.  We currently mine about 10%-12% of all bitcoins, so that's the supply with have to work with.
Currently, I don't have any plans for themed coins.  Unfortunately, we've been extremely busy just expanding our product line to offer the full range of denominations.  Now, with the launch of Bitcoin Chips, we have finally completed both the high-end and low-end ranges of the products.  
This may not be obvious, but with the current range, we are also targeting investors.  The idea is that Bitcoin investors (hoarders?) can choose to hold their Bitcoins in physical form, in these "cold wallet" type physical bitcoins.  We're trying to make that more accessible, and cater to investors of all ranges, from owning a few Bitcoin Chips, to the larger units like the Five Bitcoin, and even the Bitcoin Blocks.

@_date: 2016-11-28 01:52:37
Hi hybridsole,
In terms of AltCoins, sorry, I don't have a lot of favorites.  My interests and passion lies in Bitcoin.  Personally, I think getting Bitcoin off the ground is already such a difficult task, to get worldwide acceptance.  For these reasons, I don't spend time on AltCoins.
I support the Core team's efforts to scaling Bitcoin.  Even though there's a lot of opposition in the industry, I fundamentally believe that the most important thing for Bitcoin, is to ensure that it remains as a reliable digital asset, that the store-of-value proposition has to be strong first.  Once that's established, then the payments aspects can be addressed.  
So let's scale bitcoin responsibly, and be patient about it.  We do need layer 1 scaling for larger block sizes, but let's do the hard fork responsibly.  This cannot be rushed.
Bitcoin is still growing very fast in China.  We constantly see more demand here.  I think the challenges of Bitcoin going mainstream in China is the same as for everywhere else:  It's to overcome people's natural misunderstanding (or lack of understanding) of Bitcoin.  Bitcoin is just so different than anything else people are familiar with.
They don't understand the importance of decentralization, the idea of no counterparts risk.  The biggest hurdle to adoption right now, is actually the understanding of Bitcoin and why it's revolutionary and better than the current system alternatives.

Hi Vizique,
Your concerns are indeed what keeps me up at night (so to speak!).
I have taken great precautions to never outsource,  or depend on anyone else, for the full process surrounding the creation and handling of private keys.  I do not store a copy of the private keys, and the paper copy is printed out exactly once.  (if there are any mistakes in printing, then the printout is discarded and those keys/addresses are just abandoned.) Most importantly, the private key files are not removed from the offline computer's hard disk, and thus never transmitted to another device, or over the network. 
As for the printouts, we use a 3M polyester paper that is waterproof and tear-resistant.  It's not fireproof, but we do think this is the best solution out there.  Obviously, I haven't tried storing this paper for 50+ years and see what happens, but I have high confidence that the printing on it will hold up for many, many years. 
Also, I have purchased a lot of BTCC Mint products myself, so I have a lot at stake also.  :)
Glad you like the chips!  I love them too.  (They're the only product where they are even better when you have more of them!)

That was a mistranslation of Samson’s comment. Samson said “Core released 0.13 for miners who are not willing to adopt SegWit. 0.13 has all the improvements that are in 0.13.1 except for SegWit, including compact block relay, Child Pays for Parent, and intelligent transaction mining selection.” We’re posting a clarification on 8BTC.

Hi Cor-Leonis,
Thank you for your compliments!
The security of Mint collectibles, specifically, the security of the private keys (printed and electronic), is very important to me and the integrity of this product and business. I take it very seriously, and have spent countless hours refining the process to ensure that those private keys don't get leaked.  
All keys are generated on an offline computer, with a spinning hard drive that has full disk encryption.  They key files are never sent electronically over the network, and never copied onto any removable USB drives.  Print them out once, and then deleted.  Once printed out, the paper copies are always handled under my direct supervision. 
I can probably elaborate more on this topic if you guys have more specific questions.
As for legal/accounting status, unfortunately, we currently don't sell our Mint products to the USA due to regulatory reasons, as all of our products contains private keys which are all loaded with bitcoins.
@_date: 2016-11-03 07:15:56

Hi dskloet,
Ah!  You're asking about Samson.  I think you'll need to ask him why.
@_date: 2016-11-28 01:45:40
Hi Guy_Tell,
That's a good suggestion that others have brought up before, which is for us to ship "empty" coins, to be loaded later.
There's mainly two reasons why we choose not to do this:
1) loading of bitcoins via the coinbase transaction of the mining pool is actually a tricky business.  There are times, due to fast successive blocks, when the same address gets loaded twice.  In that case, we would need to charge more upfront, and then issue a refund.  (or need to charge a higher mark up fee.)
2) I really want all of our physical bitcoins in the market to contain loaded bitcoins, so that all people at all time, know that they can trust a BTCC Mint coin they receive (as long as the hologram sticker is intact).  This is to improve dependability and trust in our products.  That's why it's not feasible, in my mind, to selectively mine to certain addresses once we get buyer confirmation that the coin has been received.
If there are better ideas here in the future, I'm happy to consider them.
@_date: 2017-01-18 16:07:12
In other words, no official report on the talks has been released yet and no regulatory action has been taken as of midnight China time on January 18th.

Hi magicboy110,
Again, we're not currently able to ship to the USA due to regulatory reasons.  FinCEN and bitcoin regulation rules require us to obtain certain licenses, which we haven't yet completed. Even though we would love to ship to USA customers, unfortunately, this is not possible yet. 
The idea of Bitcoin Chips actually originated last year, at the beginning of this journey.  The whole BTCC Mint series has been over 1.5 years in the making.  It started with trying to think about how we can take advantage of our mining pool, which generates brand new bitcoins in the coinbase transaction.  In late 2015, I had a conversation with my brother, Charlie Lee, who's also into Bitcoin collectibles.  I floated the idea that we could do the same and make physical bitcoins, with an added feature of loading with brand new uncirculated bitcoins from the mining pool.
So with those brainstorming ideas, we imagined a whole series of coins and chips, from low denominations to the highest, a full block, known today as the Bitcoin Block.  We call that a Nugget, like a natural gold nugget. 
Since last year, I already made up my mind about the denominations and sizes.  All sub-bitcoin units will be in the size of the standard casino-style chips, at 39 mm.  And larger units should be larger, starting with the One Bitcoin at 43 mm (which is also a standard-size casino chip, just larger variety).  But for all sub-Bitcoin units, I wanted to make it all the same size, rather than keep making them smaller and smaller, the reason being: one day, they will all be very valuable, regardless if it's just 100,000 bits, 10,000 bits, or even just 1,000 bits.
In terms of launch, we decided to do the One Bitcoin first, to establish the brand of BTCC Mint.  and then over the course of the year, to release newer products.
Since Casascius is no longer making coins, we saw a huge gap in the market.  For BTCC Mint, we want to offer the community the best of class physical bitcoins.  
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:01:59
Hi AIcohoLiX,
Are you referring to the current Bitcoin Blocks?
Right now, they're made to reflect the fact that it's a full block.  So we cannot sell that to you unfunded, because that would be misrepresenting the product. And furthermore, we would have repetitional risk if you chose to re-sell it on the secondary market and represent it as the full Bitcoin Block.
For integrity reasons, all products we sell are properly marked as having the correct amount of bitcoins in it.
if there's enough demand, we can create a new empty coin/block, that's properly market as unloaded/empty.
@_date: 2016-11-28 02:05:34
Hi dwdoc,
Let's wait and see.  
Even though there are people out there who don't like what Core is doing, I still fundamentally think that they are a very valuable resource in the Bitcoin community, and whatever compromise we propose, that we need to involve the feedback and input from Core team.

Yes, we have publicly stated that we will mine according to the NYA plan, aka SegWit2x. We will not “attack” any other chains. Developers can change the POW of the software anytime they want, and fork off a new altcoin. That was how litecoin was born. As for “attack,” I’m not clear what you mean by “attacking” the bitcoin blockchain.

The NYA plan will go forth simply because people committed to this, and will make the upgrade happen in November. Hashing power will follow that plan.

@_date: 2017-11-02 02:25:11
After the upgrade/fork in November, I expect the upgraded blockchain to work well, and thus we would utilize that as the main blockchain, allowing our customers to deposit to and withdraw from that. If a legacy 1x blockchain survives in a usable manner, we would also allow our customers to use that.

Thank you! I agree that Bitcoin Core developers have done a great job so far, developing and maintaining bitcoin for the past nine years. We owe them our gratitude.

Hi, this is from our FAQ ( How do you ensure the security of private keys?
The private key under each coin’s hologram is produced on a computer that is not connected to the internet during the creation and printing process. The private keys are printed on a secure printer once and the soft copy of each private key is immediately destroyed, meaning that the only copy of the private key left is the printed private key under the coin hologram sticker.
To ensure the highest security standards, the important process of attaching each private key underneath the hologram is performed by BTCC’s chief executive of officer Bobby Lee, or under his direct supervision.
