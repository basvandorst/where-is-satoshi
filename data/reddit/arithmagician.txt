Hmmm, i think the best thing i can think of dogecoin is that it doesnt take itself too seriously, it was infact created as a joke currency, older than 99.99% of other shitcoin.
It didnt need the feel to attack other crytocurrency coins just for it to remain its usability, and for me personally i became a bagholder when i saw this masterpiece of a dogecoin video :

This much dust in only 6 weeks? I think you need to use an air purifier.
I run my mine in a dusty industrial neighbourhood, and after using an air purifier and an air-conditioner (not 2 in 1 ones, they are bad) i went from needing to clean once per 10weeks, to once per approximately 30 weeks.
The air conditioner is mostly to cool the room that the miner is in, the air purifier does all the job of cleaning the air.

My humble personal estimation for worth **x** million in **y** year and how long this **volatility period** will last:-
**x** = 0.000...1 USD ( infinitesimal ) to ∞ (infinity)
**y** = next nanosecond up to the heat death of the universe
**volatility period** = sorry to sound like a broken record, but again, next nanosecond up to the heat death of the universe
