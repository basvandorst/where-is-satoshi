This post makes me so happy. Nothing against anyone who's in, I'm just so sick of pumpers who are overnight financial advisors on my Facebook feed, talking people who don't know dick from dog ear into dumping boocoos of money into it.  When it's soaring telling everyone they're fucking fools if theyre not on board, then go silent when it falls (when you should get in).  I'm sorry to people who are down, but this brings me great pleasure. Meanwhile, my stock portfolio is up 478%, and if shit hits the fan my transaction times are less than a second. Thank you bull market! $ROKU $TTI $SGMO $COLL $SRPT

God if you're for real please take profit, and a lot of it.

You can either actualize it now for a small loss, next week for a larger loss or in 2018 for a catastrophic loss. I'd say hold if you got in under $1200

Haha this is so true. At that point it's time to forget about it or cash out, cause the ship has sailed.
@_date: 2017-12-22 16:59:22
At a certain point yes.

I honestly don't know anything about it

He could just be honest say he put the money in Bitcoin. Can't get blood from a turnip.

That's because transactions are taking two days to go through. Nobody knows the toll yet.

There's gonna be plenty more where that came from. Good rule of thumb, if my granny ask me about it, it's too late to enter. 
@_date: 2017-12-22 19:26:31
Agreed

Sounds like a better entry point to me

I agree, I don't see blockchain going anywhere.  I'm just so sick of pumpers on my Facebook feed. I feel like up until recently it has grown organically, now it's the next big thing and getting pumped to the moon. it'll go back up, but I could just as easily see it hitting 5K before it hits 40K. And when Moms and Pops, that just heard about it on CNBC, see a chunk of their retirement go from $200,000 to $80,000 in two months, they'll pull the plug to stop the bleeding, which will cause more sell off. Don't 1000 people own 40% of Bitcoin? A few people decide they want to live out they're lives as multi billionaires and sell all; it'll be pandemonium. Long story longer, if it hits 7K again I'll buy in.  But what do I know, I went to public school, and I thought it was too expensive at $3300.

The good times were 6 months ago

This is the worst advice I've seen in awhile. Using that logic the person your talking about would have been invested in bitcoin in 2010 when it was $.008 per coin.
