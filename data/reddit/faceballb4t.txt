I thought the idea was to only use money that you don't care about losing. No point in wasting years gaining a strong understanding of something that is just going to be a hobby that you throw a few thousand bucks into. That attitude is likely why bitcoin is struggling so hard. nobody wants to teach anyone else anything. If you aren't a master you are dumb for even buying bitcoin. 5k-10k isn't a lot of money for lots of people. I would be completely unphased if all my crypto vanished right in front of my eyes. How much did the average person know about money when they were saving up their weekly allowances at 10-12 years old? are we all just dumb for not learning the fundamentals of banking and investing before we opened a savings account when we turned 14? 
Even if I were in the exact position I described in my post, I wouldn't care because none of it is worth anything to me, if I hadn't bought bitcoin I would have bought something else that would likely be worth much less than it was when I bought it. I'm up by about 800% in cryptos, and still ask stupid questions like this. and I am completely fine with that.
my emergency money is buried in a safe in my backyard, and in a debit account, so I can access it whenever i want. I'd never put emergency money into bitcoin, that's just plain ignorant and irresponsible.
@_date: 2017-12-26 03:58:33
same deal w/ me that option to "Cancel and prevent broadcasting" is very deceptive. My post seems to be getting a tiny bit more attention than yours so you can keep an eye on it for answers. I submitted a ticket to their support but not really expecting results.
@_date: 2017-12-27 16:46:52
So, I'm guessing this is one of the popular features of HD wallets? 
I still don't have a good understanding of the differences between, "master seeds" "private keys" "single addresses" "wallet accounts" 
they all just seem like different sacs of money made of various materials. kinda like girls and purses. It's a fucking mystery to me. The "accounts" part is probably what confuses me the most, are HD accounts incorporated within particular wallets? or is a wallet considered HD and all accounts are still based off a master seed? 
another one that I can't figure out after this is, what is the point of making a single address at all?
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:37:52
I don't feel like converting to euros, but let's say 0.004btc (~$100usd) was bought today.
With this amount, if bitcoin reaches $500,000usd/btc you will have $2000
$100,000/btc will give you $400 
$5,000,000/btc will give you $20,000
for a more realistic number in the next year or so lets say 60,000/btc. Your 0.004btc would be worth $240

Not at all. I didn't hodl any of it, I've been slowly spending it the entire time. And, I sold my car after the ath during the big dip that happened shortly after 20k.
 I am still currently holding (not hodling) more than 5x my fiat investment, and I've spent close to double the amount I've put in. 
I'm **very** happy with each and every purchase I've made since I originally bought Bitcoin.

I don't mean all different wallets, but just in mycelium alone I have 2 HD accounts, and a couple single addresses (from being a noob and thinking it was the way to create a new address, which I had heard was important for maintaining privacy)

it's a hypothetical situation using fake numbers. I used numbers that add up to me buying since bitcoins inception. 23500 would be $50 a week since 2008, I thought that would make it obvious, i do have somewhere around that currently though, and I've only invested 1100 fiat in total, so I'm doing pretty good I think.

I'm the guy who's bike is always tuned and in perfect running condition, and while I'm out riding around I feel like a million bucks. I love knowing that the guy driving past me in his $80,000 car compares himself to the 30 year old guy riding his bmx down the side of the road and probably assumes I am envious of his "sweet" ride, when in reality, the more expensive the car a persons is driving, the happier I am that I am not in that persons shoes.
I've known for quite a long time that the longer someone spends with money, the shittier they become as a person. Broke people have 100x more character than rich people.  
If I'm fed, my dog is fed, and my clothes are dry, I'm good. 
The funny part is, I used to make well over $200/hr doing some pretty easy work, and still have quite a few things that I bought during that time, and most of it never gets touched, and slowly I have just been giving it all away. I have a $35,000 car in my driveway that hasn't moved since around August. I use it to lean against while I'm playing fetch with my dog in the front yard.
The only reason I would ever want to be a millionaire would be to have the freedom to give it away to make other people feel better. 
Nothing makes me feel better than surprising people with generosity. Not even my dog can make me feel that good, and she's my best friend.

It's worth far too much money to simply, not get fixed. There are several options, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to speculate on that, but from what I do know, I don't see btc going anywhere but up in the near future. If I had to guess, I'd estimate the chances of it being worth less in 6 months than it is currently, to be about 10%
@_date: 2017-12-18 09:54:12
The list:
@_date: 2017-12-31 14:47:15
Of course, because reasons, right? 
I've never understood this shit. Like, are you incapable of determining when a new idea is being presented, without a space to indicate a new paragraph? Or do you struggle with carrying over to the next line, so you can only read small sections at a time, otherwise you lose your place? Seriously, I've never heard a single explanation for peoples unrelenting hate towards improper paragraph structure. When people are talking, and it's transcribed, there is never splits in paragraphs, because we don't focus on sequencing ideas one at a time. If we did, conversations would be ridiculous, luckily that's not how language works. So, if you just consider that people are typing along with the thoughts in their head, most of the time, it would be a lot easier, and more direct to just write things out as one big sentence. 
But, by all means ignore every "wall of text" you come across. Just realize those walls are usually a lot less filtered, and more truthful than any properly written paragraphs.
Personally, my enter key on my laptop feels too much like the shift key under it, so I got in the habit of using the enter key on the numpad, which makes it a little tedious to use for things other than "enter to send".  
Yea, it's stupid, but if someone doesn't want to read what I have to say because my grammar is lazy, then I don't care about their opinion, anyway.

Out of all of those, I never paid more than 250sat/B except to pay my friend, because I wanted him to get it quick, so I paid about 300sat/B, which was like $7.90 to send $623

It means you can afford to lose it without getting pissed off. You knew well ahead of time about different times accounts were compromised, and unless you're a master of encryption, I guarantee you considered that as a risk around the time you first bought in. Furthermore, if you bought into an exchange, you must have known about Mt.Gox, nearly everyone in bitcoin knows about Mt.Gox so with that knowledge you can't just assume there's only one way bitcoin will screw you around.
If you trust a complete stranger with your money, and then complain when they don't give it back to you, you're an idiot.
If you're smart enough to hold an interest in cryptocurrencies, you're smart enough to understand that shit can, will, and does happen, especially when money is involved.

If it means me spilling the beans, there's essentially a 0% chance of anyone ever getting my coins.

I can't tell if I am good at trading or if I suck, but I want to get better at it and can't find any good resources to get started.. I use Quadriga and it has a pretty small (~1k btc)  volume usually, that mixed with being  a complete noob, I am playing with about $90. Whenever I decide to do some trades in a day, I usually only manage to trade maybe 4-6 times at the very most. I have profited on every single trade, but I usually only make between $3-7 over a day.. Is this pathetically low, or am I just using such small amounts, that the profits seem tinier? I am satisfied w/ my results so far since I've made around 40-50 in the last month, but can't help but feel I'm doing everything wrong. Any help would be greatly appreciated.

It's just angsty Bcash trolls. They make posts claiming they paid insane fees and exclaim how they are "done" with bitcoin forever, etc...
And anyone that comments on the contrary, they call them spawns of Satan, lying scumbags, paid shills, etc...

Do you know what "as soon as possible" means? it doesn't mean it'll happen fast, it means when they are able to, they will. It's only a promise that something will get done, not that it will get done fast. You're causing yourself unnecessary stress. Imagine how fucking swamped these people are with work, it takes 2 seconds for some noob to submit a ticket and it can take hours to explain, and resolve the issue, to that noob. Now, imagine how many times this happens in a day. The faster bitcoin grows, the more workload these guys have. Would you be able to keep up if your boss suddenly told you that you must do 6x more work than you currently do in a day, and you have to do it before lunch time, for no extra pay? You would probably tell your boss to eat a dick, and potentially(likely) quit your job, which would leave the burden on the other remaining employees to take on the work that you refused, so now they are forced to increase work load by 9x, how many people you think are going to quit when that happens? 3? now the remaining employees are faced with 32x more work than they are used to, without a raise because most of the work probably doesn't involve them actually getting paid, more likely them paying the customer. So, to keep everyone happy and not go bankrupt immediately, they are probably deciding it's worth the risk to use customers funds to give their underappreciated employees the raises they deserve, which I think is better than all exchanges just filing for bankruptcy. Bitcoin would be dead if it wasn't for these guys. have some fucking patience.

I don't know why people invest money they can't afford to invest. I dropped $1000 in mid-October and I'm not even going to consider "selling" or "withdrawing" for at least a year, and there's not a chance I'll sell for less than I paid. Either I make a few bucks, eventually, or in the unlikely chance bitcoin becomes obsolete I lose that 1k, which I already consider to be gone anyway, so I am just riding this shit out. kinda just using it as an excuse to get back into tech stuff also.

Yup, I'm in it because it gives very decent returns, but currently at the rate I'm investing, I'm aiming to grab myself a nice Ducati motorbike in 5-10 years. Also, anything that could potentially take out the federal reserve, is fantastic, in my books, even though I don't think bitcoin will be responsible for that. I do believe cryptos do stand a chance, but bitcoin in my eyes is the windows 95 of cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-11-08 12:06:43
it was basically the same as it is now. the whole chart stayed between about 5000-7500 over 4 years
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:38:39
No this is not what I'm saying at all. I'm just putting numbers down. Basically what I'm saying is unless you have multiple bitcoins now, or tens of thousands to invest in the near future, AND patience/faith to hang on for the next decade or so, that bitcoin is not going to be buying anyone Lamborghinis for a long time, or, more likely, ever.
@_date: 2017-11-26 09:54:45
People we're saying this exact shit after they sold for $70. At one point (2011, I think) a guy auctioned 10,000 bitcoins for $50 and nobody bought them.
 There's still room for growth, something this revolutionary doesn't just stop at $9,000.

@_date: 2018-03-23 18:39:59
It's an adverb as an introductory word, and only in very rare cases is a comma correct, and in this case it is quite clearly out of place. 
It's not WRONG, but neither is saying "I have one hand." (I have two hands, but I definitely have one). It's accurate, and correct, but it's unnecessarily confusing, and not considered proper.
The comment op replied to was two parts, so since the reply was split into two parts, it reads as if to say "Sometimes (memory can "...fool even the best"), followed by an arbitrary statement. In which case the sentence is formatted incorrectly. 
I'm not going to elaborate any more, but the correct, proper sentence in this case would be, 
    Sometimes this sub is the worst.

So.... 
@_date: 2017-10-30 04:11:35
Are ya? 
@_date: 2018-04-19 19:09:59
but in your method, you're actually sending the package back, and that defeats the entire purpose.... if you leave a bit of time in between before opening the package your ass is covered. I'm not going to keep arguing about this. Don't do it if you don't think it will work. I'm not forcing you to do anything. I'm just suggesting an idea. 
@_date: 2018-04-19 13:21:26
You can give your name and address, and still not be held responsible for mail you received. The key is to not open things that could bring heat until the time you think the heat has died. ie. if you order some acid or some other illegal substance, bring the mail in, and leave it on your kitchen table for a month before you open it. If LE shows up you show them the package and say you had no idea what it was, so you were going to return it back to the sender. 
If it were illegal to receive mail, people would be sabotaging and framing their enemies constantly.
If I didn't like you, I could send you drugs in the mail and then tip off the police that you're expecting a package, and you'd go to jail... 
P.O. boxes and drop addresses are a waste of time and only increase the chance of drawing suspicion
 
Using a fake name doesn't hurt anything. but if you use a different name every time you get mail your mailman will probably take notice.
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:55:05
not even slightly joking, why do you think that?
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:32:15
If it's gone when they show up, and they knew it was delivered, then you're immediately guilty unless you can prove it was returned to the sender. If it's on your table with a memo saying "return this", then you've done nothing illegal.
in the hypothetical circumstance of me "crackmailing" you, If you were arrested (quite possible) they would have to charge you with something or release you, and since you've done nothing illegal there's nothing to charge you with.
Besides the way I have described, how would **you** "not accept" something that is left in your mailbox?


If you don't want to use/agree with the method I suggested, you have no obligation to do so, but it _does_ make sense, and works better than using a drop/po box, without a doubt. PO boxes are very, very risky.
@_date: 2018-04-19 18:03:42
I know multiple people that have been doing it that way since before SR even existed, and at least 2 occasions where charges were laid, and then dismissed, so I'm more than content in using this method if needed. Even if police, or whoever were concerned did know about the scheme, there's nothing they could do anyways, as, like I said earlier, it's not illegal to receive mail. As long as they can't tie the source of the purchase to you, (which is incredibly hard to do, since proving who was behind a computer screen at any given time is VERY difficult) then you are innocent in the eyes of the law, and it would take one hell of a good prosecutor to actually convict you.. 
Again, if this _weren't_ the case, I could send a kilo of heroin to your house, and have you thrown in jail for 10 years. You realize how many people would be doing this (why take your competition out with guns/violence, and risk your own life, when you can quietly have them locked up  just by sending them a package in the mail?)
@_date: 2018-04-19 20:56:41
I'm talking weeks, to maybe one month at most. If anyone is going to show up and confront you about a package they will show up within the first few days most likely, in which case it's perfectly believable that you just hadn't gotten around to returning the package
@_date: 2018-04-19 15:56:46
she wouldn't need to. It's not illegal to receive mail.
