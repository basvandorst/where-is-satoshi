Peter Schiff (even though I hate the guy sometimes) said markets take the stairs up and the elevator down which is very true. Crypto markets not only have entered a recession but a depression IMO ( I'm going by % in the red and sustained levels, we're in day 2) Bitcoin recessions lasted just a few hours then the rally was always right around the corner, it's not this time around. my 2k target is just your typical 90% old school crash from the top (which was 20k last month) It would put it at 32 billion in market cap. China and SK fud ain't helping either. I hope it doesn't go that low but if it does, I wont be surprised.

Anything Ver touches is shit, won't go to the site but I can tell you  what the deal is here in FL.   20-300 bucks, no ID. 300-1100, need to swipe your ID @ the ATM. 1200-7500 need to swipe your ID plus enter your social security number in it. That's it. That's just for Florida, haven't used any in other states nor have I bothered to look it up. Hope it helped.  If you need to cash out large sums and stay under the radar there's other options available. Simply going to ATMs and pulling out 300 bucks every day for X days is just a damn pain and hassle.

It's not a bad idea, it's just the amount of money you need to make, let's say. 100 bucks a day has gone up and sourcing the latest tech in miners is not easy at all. In the long run it will be a good move IF (the price of Bitcoin keeps appreciating over the longer run) and you decide to hold. 100 bucks a day in bitcoin over 31 days is 3100usd. But those 3100 usd over a 1 year and 10x rise would be 31k. Now you would need idk how many miners to achieve that but the cost would be somewhere around 16k*** Just an estimate. You have to ask yourself if spending Xk is worth Xk in the long run, if and only if the markets perform to the degree you would need them to. If they don't you can adjust or even sell your gear to minimize loses. If you just buy directly you are tethered down a bit further to price swings and idk what your risk tolerance is, this sub has a balls to the wall, no prisoners approach to the situation.

There's two huge problems now, when btc went from 100 to 1200 then down to 120 not many people owned it. Now.... 80% have been mined, lots of people bought in @ 17,18 and 19k respectively. There's tons of people sitting on a 45ish% loss as we speak. They aren't "hodlers" they are people who got burned and don't have the same mentality as the majority of us here. By 2025  another 50-80% decline will effectively kill bitcoin since the ones at the top would either have to sell at a loss or "hodl" til some new blood enters and I don't want to think of that outcome.

An RSA key is not a problem solver lol. With a public key (which there's zillions posted online) you can ram keys at it (takes years, but eventually will take minutes) til it cracks wide open and the btc is there for the taking. My idea was to have a way where X days, weeks or months your btc is moved from private key to private key to make it harder to steal if the key is figured out by cracker.

@_date: 2018-01-25 16:04:24
I always followed the price throughout the years and came to a simple conclusion, in the LONG run, even when it looks like you're mining at a loss (for the moment at least) you will always come out ahead and profit a good 6-12 months after that. I got back in early last year. Geared up and bought a ton of gpus to mine alts and trade for btc, can't complain it's been great and if these so called "analysts" are correct then by October I'll have enough to buy the 2019 Mustang GT500, which will be my lambo I guess. I don't plan on depleting ALL of my BTC but just some to cover a significant portion of the purchase, I set myself up in a way where I benefit from BOTH the loss in value of BTC and appreciation by third party contract mining. If the value drops, I make more in BTC in terms of mining ppl alt coins. When it goes up I just make less BTC but the $ range is semi constant. I didn't wanna just buy directly, I wanted to protect myself a bit so I bought a ton of gear to mine, if every single market goes to zero ( which I doubt it will at this point) Then I can just sell my cards and whatnot to the gamer people. I bought my cards last year @ 220 a pop,. they're going for 739 online and with no end in sight of a price reduction, I opened up a corporate account with AMD to get the best deal possible, the cards were going @ 279 retail so a 59 dollar cost reduction per card was a profit I didn't have to realize @ the moment. So far so good, I'm back and I'm not letting it go this time. lol

This is alot worse that it feels like right now and simply "hodling" is not a viable strategy.

There should be more questions, does this person want to pay taxes on all that? You can dump them on any exchange @ market price and withdraw to your account. Read up on every exchange tho, that's serious currency your'e going to be dealing with. More restrictions will apply rather than the ppl playing around with 1 and 2k at a time. 
Edit: I'll give you my personal advice, look up as many exchanges and find the one best suitable for your needs, I wouldn't even think of dumping that much on the market @ 1 time. The exchange can fuck you good and take it X months to get back to you after they freeze your account for some stranger with no KYC doing something like that.

lol. Bitcoin hitting 100k next year. I'm trying to install a lightning node but I'll admit I have 0 skills for this, just doing it step by step. There's 1373 coins out. If LN comes out in full force and works how it's being sold that means 1372 coins became obsolete overnight.

@_date: 2018-03-16 12:30:02
It's obvious a good 90-95% crash was imminent, I stated that late Dec and was called crazy. The shitty part is that it's taking sooooo looonng. We're going down to 2-2.5k range, I wanted to get there fast so we can bounce back but the length is just juicing the FUD and further puts downward pressure on Bitcoin. That coupled with central banks wanting to make their own DC (digital currency) is not good at all. We need to further accelerate the crash down to 2k so we can start rising again and FAST!

Depends on what you call "data" most corrections suffer a 80-90% drop. So from a top of 20k that would put us in  that range more or less. We never came close to those levels, I would've preferred we got there and fast, faster we hit 2k the faster the trend back up would've been.
@_date: 2018-03-24 14:32:44
I had about 2k back in the day that's unrecoverable for me now, it isn't like this hasn't ever happened before.... I bought 20 bucks of btc @ 6 cents each in 2010 also...

Nick, any tech that these "far superior" coins have can be implemented into Bitcoin. It's just code, it's nothing. It's not patented software guarded by laws and nations, lawsuits and BS. Once lightning kicks into gear at the end of this year most ALT coins will be worthless. Alt coins can only promise faster and cheaper tx, when they can't do that then what? Every coin tries to outbitcoin one another. What happens when it costs 0.00001 USD to move 10 million dollars in an instant thru mainet? Name recognition will be a big player in the coming years. 
@_date: 2018-02-15 14:14:04

This is obvious, every shitcoin out there will fail because Bitcoin was very slow to evolve at the start. Bitcoin is back to being cheap and fast, when you take that perk away from 99% of the market what do you get? A worse failure than the 1929 crash in shitcoins. This includes ETH imo.

A floor is a resistance level where the price of X does not go under a certain price point due to buyers coming in the market. Normally considered a floor when 3 price confirmations deem it a "floor" Same goes the other way with breakout and ceiling resistance.

It was stagnant for a few years til it was reintroduced into the financial news cycle again. Just look @ every year from December til Feb. I've been @ this since 2010. It can go to 25 cents tomorrow, it wouldn't phase me much anymore. The "biggest crash" I saw was 6 cents to 12 bucks then down to 20 cents lol.

Maybe there wasn't any and just whales jerking everyone off. 
@_date: 2018-03-06 20:06:41
Yeah but you need millions of ppl swiping that card everyday to keep the party going. This company might get 100k ish ppl on board then 1% doesn't sound viable.

I still got my 2-2.5k predictions up, it will rebound but it still needs to bleed out tons more. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 14:53:12
lol what? One year it went from 100 to 1200 then back to 100. We went from 1k to 20. I thought we were going to 2-2.5k. (Which still might be a possibility since we're still a downtrend.)

What are they worth now?
@_date: 2018-02-12 17:29:26
I do agree we should make a system where smaller transactions are easier understood (think of the older ppl for this one) that could be somewhat comparable to USD. I personally don't see the btc number and simply use a fiat based estimation. I''ll send 10 bucks worth of bitcoin and it will look like 0.xxxxxx. What I do know is that as time passes the amount of Bitcoin needed to pay for goods and services is going down. Bitcoin does have an intense deflationary property which would hinder the proposal for decimal changes and new naming. More time is needed til it starts accelerating in value and creates a new floor around 100k because whatever is constructed now would not be fitted for future use.

For the confused ones here. The survey was 1000 kids. 212 of them said they used their student loan money to invest in crypto. Now, a 100 bucks from that 10k loan could've been used, it doesn't say the amount the 212 kids used to invest in it. It could be 10 bucks per kid or 10k. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 02:39:00
It's digital real estate on a decentralized transactional network that will not be subject to corruption by central banks or govt. The more of the digital asset you hold and own. (i.e Bitcoin) The more you will be able to transact over the network. We're still in the wild west of this shit so buy and hold on.

I remember some of you trying to sound like the voice of reason here (well it's a credit card, it's not the customers money) Let this be a reminder of why we are here. The banks are not your friends, they don't give a flying fuck about you, they don't care if you can pay your bills or not, if you're sick, hungry. Their job is to make as much money as possible, off every single jackass that has an account with them. Do we understand now? Do we?

use the CC to buy metals. sell metals @ jewlrey stores and get the fiat, back into the bank acct and buy crypto with that. The GG (good game for the nubs) loophole they found was that. If everyone loads up on crypto @ these ridiculously low prices and bails on the bill. The people holding the crypto will be richer than the CC companies overnight. 
@_date: 2018-03-01 14:14:22
Well that deescalated quickly. Weren't we gonna hit 100k?

It's not that it's not going to happen "anytime soon" It's what they CAN regulate is mere on and offramps. Bitcoin itself is unregulatable (if even a word) No govt body has the cojones to get behind a podium and say that.
