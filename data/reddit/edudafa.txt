They won't use what they can't control.
So they have to create these kind of nonsense things.

According to Credit Suisse the total global wealth in 2018 was around 317 trillion USD.
So, if Bitcoin ever became the backbone of the global financial system, (we just have to wait a little more), you could take the total global wealth and divide it by the number of Bitcoins in circulation, and you'll end up with the value of 1 Bitcoin in that scenario.
It's pretty amazing.

There're 2 types of keys: public keys, used to receive bitcoins; and private keys, used to sign the transactions you receive, so you can spend them elsewhere.  
The public key is generated from the private key.  
If your bitcoins are in an exchange, you are likely to only have access to a public key, generated by the exchange's private key. If you have a mobile or a hardware wallet, the private and public keys are created by the wallet.

That's fine.
By a key, I mean a private-key.  
A private-key is what grants you, ownership of any amount of bitcoin you may have.
It is important to know the basics of how bitcoin works. Look on the internet for videos and books about bitcoin, so you can understand it better.

I'm not acquaintance to cashapp or ledger nano, so I strongly suggest that you go to [bitcoin.org]( to inform yourself.

Move your bitcoins out of coinbase to a hardware/paper wallet, then delete the coinbase app.
Who knows what could happen in the meantime, you must always have control of your keys, or the Bitcoins are not yours.
