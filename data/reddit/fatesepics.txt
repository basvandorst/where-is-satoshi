Binance making too much money on fees. I can go on robinhood and buy and sell stock for free.  Actually a bad thing for the consumer that they are making so much money in that respect.

They want you to put more in before they pull out the rug.

As a person who lives in New York, a lot of exchanges are not compliant here but imo Coinbase pro is best to go fiat&gt;btc/eth/ltc and Binance to go btc&gt;other crypto. Sucks that you can't trade options or take leveraged positions on these platforms but I don't think there is a legal platform to do this in NY for retail traders?

He's not wrong. This is going to be one of bitcoins biggest hurdles. Some people don't want to be their own bank.

If  Buffet says he is buying apple, he is selling. If he says bitcoin is crap, hes buying.

Bank run didn't happen but interesting to see how some banks were handling the threat.  Pretty telling.

I've looked for Spedn and Flexa in the google play store, they don't exsist.

Most people dont know how electricity works, most people dont know how the US dollar works. It just has to work and be adopted. One of the fastest ways to do that is people seeing higher prices
