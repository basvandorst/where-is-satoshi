Hello, I'm Alberto, CEO in Coinffeine.
Not yet, but we are working on it.
Coinffeine has a big spanish Bank, Bankinter, as a partner ( and we are talking with most of banks in Spain for integrating our technology with them, turning banks and payment processors into Bitcoin exchanges but without touch bitcoins, because they are saved into the desktop wallet and exchanged in a P2P way.
The bank in this model is just a payment method. Instead of transfering your money to an exchange account, you will be able to buy or sell bitcoins with the balance in your bank account.
There are many others payment processors which can be used by Coinffeine like Dwolla, PerfectMoney, Alipay or even Paypal. 
The case of Paypal would be useful but unlike Okpay, PayPal is so much expensive. Okpay is charging a fee of 0.5%, so buying bitcoins in Coinffeine will be more cheaper than Coinbase, for example.
In the first version of Coinffeine/Okpay you will pay 0.5% in FIAT fees if you are buying and 0% if you are selling.

BitsQ is great, and the community needs as many decentralized exchanges as possible. That been said, one of the main differences in Coinffeine is the ability to set automatic exchanges, automatic limit and market price orders like in a centralized exchange.
