  sign up and you can buy SLL with your debit or credit card and immediately  exchange it for btc. you will  have to wait 48 hours your first time you exchange the SLL for bitcoins but after that its pretty quick. only bummer it has like an 80 eur transaction limit per day. elt me know if you need help signing up.

3 more to go. i was thinking  somewhere not  like seattle or california.somewhere where there is a smaller crowd of crypto junkies. that way there would be room to grow together. I wouldnt want a line out the door when it opened. I would want it to slowly creep into the light.

True true but if you are in desperate need of some coin for the first time buyer with no way to get verified at an exchange in the end the price will rise and cover the fees but i agree its not somewhere  you want to get the majority of your coins from. He can try  but got to be careful not to get scammed.

I had the same amount on a bitcoin qt wallet moved it to my newly made blockchain.info wallet (before changing the transaction fee to nothing ) and it just swallowed up the amount for the transaction fee. So make sure you check the settings of both wallets before moving it.
