I understand, and I think that's awesome. I'd love to help out of you guys ever make it up to NY. I just expected something different than what it was. I don't mean that negatively, just matter of factly.

Ha. Not at all. I've actually never been to any type of coding convention before, so I probably just expected something that it was never going to be. My main problems were that it seemed disorganized, and the speaker on day one wasn't a very good public speaker. I'm on vacation in Fl, and was really looking forward to looking more into Bitcoin and the things people can do with it. 
It seemed like no one really knew what was going on, and a bunch of the things scheduled for day one were pushed back until day two. 
EDIT:: I should also note that I was only a spectator. I didn't put any prep time in so I decided not to compete.

I don't mean to be a hater. I'm incredibly happy that we're seeing bitcoin spread. I had just expected more. I'm not oblivious to the fact that I had unrealistic expectations. 
Like I said, I wasn't prepared so I didn't participate. I was signed up for spectator tickers. I'm watching the live stream now while I work on stuff. The party wasn't bad, it just didn't seem to be as code focused as I had assumed it to be. The drinks were the cheapest(money wise) that I'd had on my entire vacation and I was grateful for that. 
Seriously though, I wish everyone the best of luck and I hope the event continued smoothly.

Yeah, I was at day one super excited. Once we got there it was so sloppily run I decided not to attend day two and three. The drinks were cheap though, so they didn't completely fail. 
It also wasn't as big as I thought it would be.
