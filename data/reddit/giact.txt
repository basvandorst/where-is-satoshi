Bitcoin already has a "timestamp synchronicazion" protocol that is used to judge block timestamping (the mechanism that prevents a miner to mine the next block with a timestamp 1 year in the future).
Therefore, it could also be used for transactions (i.e. do not accept pending transactions too far in the past or in the future, and do not accept double spending versions of currently valid pending transactions).

There is a problem with your assertion.
Dried tea leaves contain about 2g of potassium every 100 g.  
(source:   
That means about 20 g of potassium per kg of dry tea leaves.
Potassium in nature is slightly radioactive (because one of its naturally occurring isotopes is radioactive).  
Potassium in nature has a radioactivity of about 29 Bq/g.  
(source: 
Therefore, dry tea leaves should have a natural radioactivity of at least (20*29) Bq/Kg = 580 Bq/kg, and that's just from potassium alone.

Basically, the mathematical "core" of Ethereum is described here:  
It's a Latex paper, so if you don't have the tools to generate the document, you can (usually) find an up-to-date version here: 
In brief, the paper describes what the blocks in the blockchain must be like.  
So all implementations know which blocks must be approved or rejected.  
It also describes how the Virtual Machine works (how each instruction must affect the "state" of the blockchain). So all implementations know what the result of a computation must be like.
Like I keep saying, it's completely deterministic.  
There is nothing undetermined in the computation (everything an instruction can "read" is in the blockchain, everything an instruction can "write" ends up in the blockchain).  
There is no even any chance of infinite loop (because of the "gas" mechanism: computation is limited by virtue of it costing something that must be paid in advance by the sender).
If you have evidence that the paper contains a bug so that two correct implementations of Ethereum might end up without consensus about the validity of one block, it could be useful if you actually told me where/how, so I can try to reproduce it, then report it to the Devs to get the paper fixed.

More like, "it's not fair for others because they will get much later than us".  
If Bitcoin succeeds as "global currency", even those who are getting in now will be early adopters with an unfair advantage.


Well, if I had to decide, I'd plan it in reverse: increase mining rewards progressively instead of decreasing them progressively.
It's still not an optimal solution, though.
The best might be to allocate an equal share to each new participant, if somebody finds an elegant way to counteract sybil attacks (i.e. forging duplicated identities).


Simply because you are basically favoring people not only because they dared risk, but also because they happened to come in contact with Bitcoin by chance and also because they happened to be already in favorable economic conditions to invest in Bitcoins.
E.g. imagine Bitcoin becomes the global currency and that North Korea becomes a democracy 20 years from now and they finally get access to the Internet.  
No matter how daring or hard working or smart or capable or good willed those future North Koreans will be, they will probably never be able to "earn" ~~less~~ more than an infinitesimal share of the Bitcoins we (have or get to give to our children as inheritance.  
And why? Cause they were not blessed by luck nor social status.
~~What I am not liking about Bitcoin is that it's basically creating the equivalent of an aristocracy.~~ Based partially on risk taking, but also based a lot on luck (early contact with the technology) and previous social position (we Bitcoiners can afford investing in Bitcoin because we already are economically privileged, compared to most of the world population).  
_Edit: that's not even true. I am actually kinda neutral to Bitcoin creating the equivalent of an aristocracy. What I don't like is when some Bitcoiners trumpet Bitcoin as if it's going to create some egalitarian revolution._

 * If there is a problem, Charlie can intervene and sign a transaction giving the money to either Alice or Bob, and the receiver can add their signature to receive the money.

With the way I had it in mind: if a pending transaction is "too far in the past" (e.g. one minute) it should be rejected by a node. 
If Bob connects and t1 is too far in the past, he will reject both (in a big enough network this should not be a problem)  
If only t2 is too far in the past, he rejects t2.  
If both are within the threshold, he accepts t2 and passes it along.
This way I know that if I do not see a double spend from you within one minute, your chance of double spending are greatly reduced (you could still manage it by colluding with powerful miners).

Ultimately, even the current structures are voluntary.  
You are "free" not to take part of the state and leave its borders or be isolated in a prison.
Imagine some utopia where the whole society is a giant voluntary association of non-statist anarcho-capitalist individuals who all agree on not doing *X* and not dealing with people who do *X* because *X* is "wrong".  
If you want to do *X*, you would be free to live in total isolation (i.e. exile/prison).  
How is that __functionally__ different from how states currently work?
Besides, it's not very likely that the governments we have now are the result of some malicious intelligence planning and guiding them since the beginning of human history... they are more likely the "evolution" of voluntary associations of free individuals.

You should read it as "hidden cost per transaction for the bitcoin userbase".
Because that cost is hidden, and it's spread among all users.  
And it does not factor in the cost to miners.


To the group of "bitcoin users": yes it does.  
But if the price crashes that much and miners do not unplug their hardware, then it means that miners are mining at a loss and then it's miners that are subsidizing the bitcoin network.  
(Of course, I guess that at that point miners are very likely to unplug)


Again, yes. That's how it would cost to bitcoin users as a mass.
In that case, miners would suddenly make a lot of profit since their cost stays the same (at least until new miners rush in driven by the profit increase).
I actually had an interesting conversation about it in here:

You have addressed why you think it's good enough to timestamp blocks, but not why it's not good enough to timestamp pending transactions.

That's not true, unless you (mistakingly) assume that all crypto currencies past present and future __must__ be designed with a limited total amount of minable coins.
If a pre-mined crypto coin does not have such a limit, then the pre-mined amount divided by the current amount becomes infinitesimal with time.
PS: you are also wrongly assuming that all crypto currencies past present and future __can__ be forked. It's entirely possible that in the future somebody will develop a crypto currency with a not-open-source license that could still be trusted (e.g. by being source-available but not open).
@_date: 2014-08-23 08:01:39


This is rhetorical nonsense.
Let's analyze it:


How? Why?  
Don't you think it's entirely possible for some people to believe in a falsehood that simply does not affect their life at all?
E.g. some farmer in the middle of nowhere might believe that moon landing was a hoax... perhaps he might even believe that the moon is made of cheese... the truth would not "come at a very high cost" to him, even if he does not embrace it.


And what does this even mean?
Let's set aside the subject of Bitcoin for a second.  
What does "X is akin to pure truth" mean?
* "akin" denotes similarity but not identity
* "pure" denotes that whatever it's attached to can have various degrees of "taint/purity"
How would this even work with "truth"?
Also, how do you apply the quality of "being (pure) truth" to anything but a statement?  
And our "X" here (Bitcoin) is not a statement.
Personally, I think that vague rhetoric like this is very likely one of the reasons why some dislike "bitcoiners" (note: not Bitcoin itself, but bitcoiners).

If the source is available and anyone can read and verify it but not "open" (e.g. if the license is restrictive and does not allow forking for commercial use) then it "can" be forked in the ontological sense (nothing can stop you from actually forking it in the privacy of your home) but it "cannot" be forked in the legal sense (it would be illegal to do so, so your forked version is not likely to spread).
From the point of view of cryptographic strength, the license does not need to be "open", all you need is being able to review the source code.
Check this for a better clarification of what I am talking about:  


For example:
* It discourages hoarding of currency, thus encouraging using the currency for actual transactions
* It partially removes the unfair advantage of being an early adopter
* It prevents the inevitable disappearance of all coins over an infinite stretch of time


Except that the USD does not give you a stable and knowable supply.  
And is not decentralized.  
And cannot be easily sent over great distance in short time.  
And everything else the blockchain can be used for.


That's opinable and probably based on your feelings only.

It's not a language, it's actually bytecodes and a virtual machine.  
But that's beyond the point.


By having the code and its input and its output are completely deterministic.  
So, as long as nodes are running proper implementations, it cannot fork.
Now, I agree that writing proper bug-free implementations of this is obviously harder than writing proper bug-free implementations of non-turing-complete blockchains.  
But it's not a logical impossibility.
Eventually, the project could employ mathematical formal verification.  
[If it has been done for a kernel]( I don't see why it cannot be done for something much simpler like a virtual machine with some dozens of bytecodes maximum.


Did you read the papers?  
Like I said, the consensus mechanism has already been formalized... and it can work because the computation is completely deterministic.

Not exactly.
Hashing has little to do with PGP.
PGP security is based on certain mathematical problems (factorization and discrete logarithms) and certain unproved mathematical conjectures about such problems (i.e. that they are "computationally hard").
Further discoveries in mathematics might undermine their security.  
And quantum computing, if it's proved feasible, has a very high chance of accomplishing the same.
Of course, brute forcing alone is also a way to attack it, but it's definitely not the only (or biggest) threat.

Yeah you misunderstood.
My idea is: nodes could use transaction timestamp to validate __pending__ transactions (those yet to be included in a block).  
If invalid, it gets rejected and not propagated.  
If valid, it gets propagated and, if the node is also a miner, it gets considered for inclusion in the next block.
If a transaction gets included in a block, it's not "pending" anymore, so it's accepted no matter its timestamp.
(Perhaps, we could also enforce that the timestamps of all transactions in a block must be in the past relative to the block timestamp itself... for coherence. But that changes little.)
