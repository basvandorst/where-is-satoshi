what site were you looking at for silver bullion for btc?  Have you had any success with them?  I am thinking about going this route but am worried about receiving the bullion with all the volatility.

"if predictions hold, we'll be seeing $50/coin, at the least, by the middle of summer 2012."
who is predicting that price?

That is true, I am trying to think of a way to ensure credibility for this.  Are there any trusted 3rd party wallet services that would hold the coins  until certain terms were met?  The raffle would need to be completed and the paperwork would need to be signed before the coins were released.  If the terms weren't met the coins would be refunded back to the address that sent them the coin.

I guess it might be helpful to know where the car is :) I am currently in Portland, Oregon.  The winner of the raffle would need to pick it up or have it shipped to its destination.

That is true, I was just trying to have a simple way of having a 1 to 1 so that it would be easier to track in an excel or in a table format.  This way could work as well.

Not really for an 04.  Most are highway cars and by this age they usually have closer to 200k miles on them.
@_date: 2013-03-10 15:22:13
That might be a good idea, does anyone have experience with  ? or are there other auction sites?

I am not really sure, I haven't done one before.  I would be completely open to any ideas. 
I was thinking about creating 300 addresses, anyone who wanted to enter the raffle could send 1 bitcoin to 1 of the open addresses.  After a coin was sent to that address it would be "closed" and the next address would be used.  People would also need to email me their name for the drawing so I could associate their bitcoin raffle ticket to their name.  The printing of the tickets would be done live and the drawing would be done live, anyone have any ideas on how it could be done so that it is completely transparent?

True, when I was thinking of this idea the coins were a bit less, the last week with the prices have been crazy.  At current prices the raffle would probably be 250 coins

This is kind of what I am thinking on how to do the raffle.  I will create a list of 300 possible address, similar to this table
| Raffle ID Name	| Bitcoin Address			|
|			|1B9YzGSL1JV3xtdwiNg9PCwJjTH9A7Qt2b
|			|188RQkBeRmzJAfZXwRxYVQHU9z28tkoc8M
Once someone enters the raffle they will need to email bitcoinvw the address they used and their name.  Once this has been verified the list will be updated and that address will be deleted so no one else uses it.  After the 300 tickets are gone the printing and the raffle will happen live by using justin.tv or youtube.com.  Does this sound like it would work, or is there a better way of doing this?  I will work on getting lots of pictures taken and create an official Ad for the car with the VIN and history of the vehicle.

I have seen ones that are this year in good condition go for over 10k.  Plus this would include snow tires, a roof rack with Bike and Ski mounts.  
@_date: 2013-03-09 22:48:09
That is a valid concern.  I would probably be weary of entering a raffle not knowing if I could trust the person running the raffle.  I am trying to think of a way that this could all be verified.  I really like the idea of doing the bitcoin raffle, but without some way of making sure all concerns are met I may just have to try and sell it private party for USD locally.
Sounds like a bitcoin raffle site that can verify the items and hold the coins until the raffle terms are met could benefit the bitcoin community.

Thanks, I will need to come up with a way that all of this can be verified and transparent.
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:49:51
Good to know :), Once I get everything figured out I will let you know.
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:58:47
@_date: 2013-03-10 02:57:14
Not a bad idea.  I would have no problem if someone in Portland wants to verify the car.  Anyone up for it?
@_date: 2013-03-10 00:51:15
hmmm, good point.  Didn't think of it like that
@_date: 2013-03-09 22:19:10
I think this could be verified through the block chain.  If an address is used twice then 2 transactions would be associated with it and the one that came in 2nd would be refunded.  
Or maybe a better way would be to email bitcoinvw asking to enter the raffle, I would reply back with an address that they would send 1 coin to.  Once the coin was received their name would be entered and added to the list.  Only the first 300 people would get a reply so there wouldn't be extra raffle tickets sold that would need to be refunded if an address got used more than once.
@_date: 2013-03-09 22:55:23
I am open to all possibilities :)
