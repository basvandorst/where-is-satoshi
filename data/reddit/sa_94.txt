An interesting idea for sure, to anyone saying there would be an mpg increase it would be completely negligible. The truck is already generating the power required via the alternator. As long as there is enough battery capacity and the alternator can keep the battery charged then the engine won't be working any harder to maintain the power output.

I'd definitely recommend the raspberry pi option. It's fairly straight forward using a tutorial and if you have no experience with coding then this is an excellent opportunity to learn some fairly basic stuff.

Absolutely, the Raspibolt guide posted below is excellent.

All good here, buying when I can. Not really bothered about the price, it'll go up at some point so there's no point getting stressed about it. 
I'm going to set up a full node with lightning in the next week or so, much better to focus attention on the technology rather than price.

Is there anyway you can open a bank account that will allow you to do a bank transfer? It'd make things a lot easier. I used to use localbitcoins and bank transfers before Coinbase started taking UK bank transfers and never found the fees to be that bad. I'm also in Scotland btw and haven't heard of any ATM's, which city are you referring too?

Indeed, I'll contact them and let them know about my poor experience and my opinion of shitpay.

I sometimes forget how little you can do before you're 18, I think your best bet is to try and talk to your dad again. Sit him down and explain to him what Bitcoin is and the potential it has for the future. You seem like a smart guy for your age and it'd be a shame for you to miss out on getting in at this price range just because of your age.

Some of my friends got interested during the last rise and now think 4k is a good price to get in at, I made sure they understand not to invest more than they can afford to lose and all is good. :)

This is not an anti anything propaganda story, it's what happend. My transaction went through fine in the end and in fairness it was actually less than an hour before it showed as paid on the Trezor site.
 I just don't like that during that time I was unsure of what was going on, may be this is how it's supposed to work but it seems pretty stupid that my transaction was confirmed and yet it wasn't showing anything on the Trezor site of things. 
To make things worse the option was still there to  send a payment via Bitcoin, I'd have thought that once I paid they'd know that and at least set it to processing or something.

I don't know where my problem is but thanks I'll do that too.

Or just "Use Bitcoin" as "work for" kinda makes Bitcoin sound like an employer or a company of some sort.

I really can't understand why people are selling at these prices, there's going to be some serious fomo when it starts to go back up and I'm just going to be sitting here laughing.
