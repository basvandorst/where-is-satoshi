Okay here are major things that you need to include in application, which are not yes/no answers.
First thing is that non refundable application fee of $5k needs to be sent together with application.
* Copy of your company incorporation docs, doesn't matter US or outside US. Contact address for every person in your company like communications, complaints department and so on. Also some other terms I didn't get. Need to spend time on googling or ask Lawsky for help.
* Detailed description of business that will be conducted, and also what was already done historically. Must include details of your products/services and in which jurisdictions you are going to operate.
* Everything related if you have anywhere else money transmission or any financial services activity licenses. If you are either applying, have applied, were denied. If denied, tell why.  
Also if you were somewhere subject of regulatory or enforcement subject - tell why.  
Provide insurance policies if yo have any.
* Provide full bio of each company stakeholder, director etc and also their whole employment history for last 15 years. Also provide organization chart and management structure.  
If company's stake holder is not a person, but entity, then provide full reports of that entity - financial statements for last 2 years, company description, shareholders, owners, directors etc, if its fund then all its holdings aswell.
* Going back to describing business activity - describe in detail proposed operations which includes information on staffing, systems, procedures, **banking relationships and a letter from bank that says that they are aware you are using bank account to conduct virtual currency related activity**
* Moreover methodology how fiat value of your btc is calculated.
* Specimen for all arrangements and flow of funds &lt;- **That shit is confusing, have a look section E points v and vi**
* Provide current financial statements. Another confusing part is **H** *iv*.  


This probably means to provide personal tax report?
* Now comes the BSA/AML. All policies and procedures have to be provided that meet  


Also who will be person(s) who will do day-to-day compliance stuff in your virtual currency start-up
* Here comes the surety bond part. Yay!  


* Provide **fingerprints** of company people who will have access to customer funds whether denominated in virtual currency or fiat.
* Provide background report for every director, principal etc. Background report is not something tiny like *doesn't have any past criminal cases*. Background report must include following: **comprehensive** credit report/history, civil court records, criminal records, education records, employment history, personal and professional references, media history, regulatory history, all credit relationships. Whole thing has to be done by the licensed private investigation company. **So it means more money needs to be spent than just $5k application fee**
* If registered as MSB, then provide copy of FinCENs letter acknowledging it.  


* Written policies and procedures required by, or related to, the requirements of 23 NYCRR 200 for: compliance; anti-fraud; cyber security; privacy and information security; business continuity and disaster recovery; complaints and complaint resolution. 
Now scrolling down, last 1/3rd of that PDF are forms that needs to be filled out. These forms are
* Authority to Release Information
* Background Report Certification
* Personal Financial Statement 
* Litigation Affidavit – Individual
* Litigation Affidavit – Licensee/Applicant
* Questionnaire
* Statement of Ownership 
* Taxpayer ID 
I think these forms are related to the requirements I listed above so that some of these requirements must be filled in these forms.
Conclusion is it's a big joke to have this burden when you want to get up and running a bitcoin startup.

thanks for answers. current use case for individuals if not purchasing stuff, then it's remittance. I don't know what incentive would I currently have to do purchase with Cuber instead of CC. Same incentive as bitcoin.
Cause it's Euro only, and SEPA transfer is like 38 cents (at least in Estonia) there is again really no incentive to do transfer via Cuber. Cause it means extra hops for sender and receiver to move money in/out from LHV bank.
If you are going to enable USD as well that's great. How much fees there would be then? I see that approach very similar to Transferwise if not completely same except ur transactions are on blockchain inside Cuber, but when moving into fiat, then banks are involved

When dealing with financial data, don't ever use NoSQL solutions, MongoDB is one of them. They are faster than relational dbs because they have loosened ACID. MongoDB + Hadoop e.g for statistics is good use case besides cache.  
With Coinbase size platform I wouldn't recommend even MySQL, but rather PostgreSQL because it has more robust ACID or even Oracle if you're willing to pay licensing fees.  
**EDIT**: Interesting what may have caused this. Clearly with relational db a single transaction would be:  
*insert new row into transaction history for incoming transaction*  
*update user balance*  
In case of failing at either of these 2 steps, transaction would have been rolled back and that transaction history row wouldn't even be written and never appear for the user. Instead, the occured exception should have been handled somehow.  
Clearly on Coinbase these 2 steps are not considered as single transaction, because second step "update user balance" didn't happen. Doesn't matter if MongoDBs document update was used or SQLs insert and update commands.  
**I'm off to recalculate my coinbase balance and I'm recommending the same to everybody else**

okay, false alarm, i figured it out. yesterday the balance was showing from all 3 addresses, now in this version they are separetd into 3 accounts and could check them separately that indeed in the 2 other addresses had remaining 30%.  
I couldn't find now where to show the total balance of all addresses (im sure before that release i saw it somewhere in settings).  
Imo now the account tab is still not so convinient, I see under 1 account 1 address, but it should be 1 account - n addresses. I assume you guys want to have it like wallet32 has? So it should abstract away the addresses in accounts overview tab, and just keep the account name and when clicking that view more details would break down by addresses

Estonia doesn't have VAT excempt for bitcoin like other European countries did it. So that means bitcoin startups don't exist there because you are required to add VAT 20% tax to any bitcoin transaction. Basically same thing that Australia did recently.
@_date: 2014-12-31 18:33:04
Sorry if this was confusing, this was what I meant exactly that computers use floating point calculations and it is not precise. And what I would stress again is that Javascript doesn't have native/included support for precise calculations. Whereas Java has built-in support [BigDecimal]( type that does all calculations precisely. Or PHP having official [BCMath]( module
For javascript you have to rely on one of the countless 3rd party libraries like math.js, accounting.js or [others]( Also what would be the chance of new developer choosing node.js and doing monetary calculations with default arithmetic operations and of course not doing unit tests and then trying to debug for example such situation where **+** is concatenating instead of doing addition?

I've lived in Europe and now living in US and am developing financial software I see how behind are the US systems.  
In US the cheques are mainly used, doing the transfer between banks requires some 3rd party service like popmoney (takes 3 business days), paypal etc. Or each bank has their own transfer method and there doesn't exist some unified method.  
Just today tried to do a transfer within Citibank to a friend using Citibank Global Transfer and the transfer didn't go through with a generic error message. Had to spend time by calling support and they couldn't help me, so I convinced my friend to accept bitcoin that he agreed and did a transfer within seconds!  
Another difference between Europe and US is that in US the bank account number is sensitive information sharing it to somebody requires trust, because once you share with somebody, they can do a pull transfer from that (coinbase, paypal etc etc). Oh, you are writing cheques to everybody, they see your bank account number there too!  
With SEPA you do transfer in your internet bank by writing recipient account number (IBAN) and his full name. Account number is not sensitive, because nobody can do pull transfers from that. Clearings happen 5 times a day and transfer can arrive on same business day or max next business day if either of the banks won't put it on hold because of suspicious transfer. Oh and the cost for wiring between any European bank is fixed 0.38 € (38 cents), in US its 10-30$ if it's not some banks own developed transfer service or 3rd party provider.  
Last thing is i'd say European banks have higher security measures to login into online bank. If in US bank you need only username/password in European bank it's atleast a combination of username/password+pin calculator. Other combinations like ID card with smart card reader or mobile-id (like 2FA)

to view balance you just need to know the address.
There is misunderstanding and the correct statement is that public key IS NOT EQUAL bitcoin address.
Address is derived from hashing public key with RIPEMD-160 algorhitm which generates a 20 chars long address, compared to public/private keys that are 32 chars long.
To spend the coins from some particular address you need to have the private key to it.
Just use any wallet that you keep control of private keys. Easiest would be to have any iphone/android wallet. You can transfer your coins from coinbase that that wallet once u have downloaded and launched it

authorities are retarted, different state institutions in Estonia haven't yet agreed what is bitcoin. Local tax authority doesn't say its alternative payment method, but just service, that's why VAT tax on top of it, whereas AML agency considers it as an alternative payment method. But ministry of finance doesn't have any opinion yet and is waiting regulations from European central bank. And while this wait may take years, people are going out from estonia to pursue cryptocurrency startups, especially to the countries who are positive for bitcoin and eagerly inviting talent to their country.

Javascript doesn't have good support for currency/monetary calculations where precision is important because computers use floating point arithmetic by default.  
Doing financial apps in Javascript is a joke, that's why Bitpay had to completely rewrite their bitcoin core first version, because it was full of bugs.  
I wouldn't recommend choosing not mature language/technology/framework for writing financial/mission critical apps, Node.JS is one of these new technologies. Also looking at bitpay job offerings all they require for engineers is knowledge of node.js, do they really make all their backend in that?
For the persistence layer/datastore I don't recommend MongoDB as we have seen Coinbase failure in displaying user correct BTC amount in user's loss (even though you can't be sure it's Mongos fault, there may be 1000 other reasons). But using NoSQL solution that you are not even sure if it has stored the record successfully after every write operation. Remember when Foursquare was down for 8 hours because of MongoDB internal critical bug?
Also weakly typed languages like Javascript, Ruby, PHP may be more error/bug prone and discovering bugs because of that may be troublesome.
What I would recommend for backend is to use relational database like PostgreSQL, MySQL, SQL-Server, Oracle.
Besides BobAlison mentions if developing for smartphones choosing their native languages and bitcoin core then c/c++ there are other types of apps for bitcoin like **web apps with pure front end and or backend with API**. For web apps I would go with Java / C++ / PHP / Python.
Java has extremely good enterprise support and is used alot in financial applications as is C# - Spring or any other DI, Spring MVC, Vaadin, GWT etc.  
PHP is not considered full blown programming language but just a scripting language, but is very mature and easy to start with. One of the most popular framework for enterprise apps is Symphony2 and is used in some serious websites.
To end a post here is one tweet:  
"Q: Why the f*ck start ups want ruby on rails developers?  
A: It's hipster technology. They create an internet startup with Rails or Node.js on top of MongoDB. The have .io domain with a name that normally ends in -er but they removed the 'e'. They code in Sublime Text on their Macbooks while sitting in Starbucks. When people ask about their work they refer to themselves as a "code artisan""
And then they rewrite the app in Java :))))) (i.e LinkedIn, Twitter)

u're right, lbtc is middleman a.k.a 3rd party in transaction because they take 1% fee.
not to be money transmitter they have to just become a listing service and not hold users bitcoins and not take a fee for every transaction. they can monetize for example with sponsored ads etc

@_date: 2015-08-12 19:45:34
when would be sufficient involvment, when they take 50% fee? a fee is a fee, therefore they are 3rd party in a transaction between buyer and seller. but i'm not saying now they need some license, just stating the fact about them being 3rd party. it's same as ebay probably, does ebay need a money transmitter license, since its same thing that commodity is being exchanged?

selling bitcoins for anything that is tied to credit card is a big no, since it can be easily charged back.  
make sure that the cards are purchased with cash and receipts are included. though this is also not always 100% safe as receipt printers are only $50 on ebay.

Maybe as a broker its not worth the time and effort put into educating these first time buyers because they need to buy very miniscule amounts of bitcoin just to pay for some ads.
On the other hand I've seen here other bitcoin selling websites (satoshicounter, paxful, libertyx) helping people from backpage get their first bitcoin. IMO we need to get more people get interested in bitcoin and should all promote it and educate together to show how superior it is to current payment options

Can anybody list all upcoming decentralized projects where bitcoin is the only currency to be used?
I mean like on OpenBazaar you can buy only with bitcoin, on Augur you bet only with bitcoins, even though it's built on ethereum, right?
Any other upcoming dapps?

bro, its far more than $5k. background checks are each $2.5k, financial statements of each person, recommendation letters and tens of more other things. as co-founder of coinbase fred ehrsham said, total cost is about $40k
@_date: 2015-07-09 11:24:52
as you can see fee was 0.0005 BTC and transaction got confirmed in like 8 hours.
Then did another transaction (1.7 BTC) on that address with higher fee 0.001 BTC (because i knew I had to increase fee) it got confirmed next block.

Just saying that russians themselves were killed too by russians, not just estonians. Basically on whole Soviet Union territory were killed about 100 million slavs, they are not complaining or bringing it up as certain other nation. Source: my Russian great grandfather and his two sons were sent to Siberia and executed there in 1938, his third son was kept alive who happened to be my grandfather. Accusation was that my great grandfather was a German spy.

It all comes down to no incentive over creditcard. Even I would think myself twice before spending BTC at merchant over credit card.
Good luck with marketplace!

u can always prepay to ur balance with cc bigger amount.  
real issue is that ISPs don't allow to resell their traffic so it's kind of gray area.  
but i'm sure that it will be still done by somebody, cause we can see good examples of airbnb and uber which r also kind of in gray area

doesn't work European Mastercard, it says "address match could not be checked". It's not debit, but creditcard.  
And when you add new billing address and choose another country, you can still only choose US states.

fold buys bitcoin, then fold sells bitcoin with 20%+ premium and goes buys the gift card on gyft.com etc.  
right now there are starbucks, target and whole foods, in no time all other merchants whose gift cards can be purchased at gyft.com will be at fold too
@_date: 2015-03-10 20:39:49
u can have these premiums by selling coins on peer2peer marketplaces.  
yes, u could do just arbitrage without giftcards, but the cycle would take longer because you need to acquire coins again by wiring to exchange which takes time.  
but in this case you have a website where people send you coins to get their morning coffee, so there is no time delay of sending money to exchange and buying coins back

I'm selling coins in person. I already met the buyer and ready to do the trade. I don't have enough coins in my wallet. So I have to rebuy back instantly from some exchange. I rebuy back. I send out to my wallet. Now I have to wait for 1 confirmation until the coins are spendable from wallet. Today it took over 1h to confirm next block. During that time with the buyer we just have some awkward talk about some bullshit until coins get confirmed. Bonus: some buyers after buying want their 2-3 confirmations as well, so more wait time.

How could multisig be utilized in peer2peer marketplace where a trade can be anything between 1 minute to 24hours? Say localbitcoins example.
Is 2-out-of-3 multisig currently used during active trade between 2 parties the way I describe it?  
Lets say I ordered some item from seller and coins went from my marketplace balance to multisig escrow and they will be released to seller upon my confirmation of received product.
What about if the trade window is like 1 - 5 minutes and trade can be cancelled? Then coins are moved back to non multisig address? So there is wait time when transferring coins back to normal address until they are confirmed.  
What about the case when the coins are just sitting in my marketplace balance and are not in active trade? How could the marketplace utilize multisig in this case so there wouldn't be situation of marketplace being hacked? How bitstamp is using now bitgo exactly?
