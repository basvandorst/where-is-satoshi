That's a good idea. Thanks.

Thank you for the useful information. Looks like it's not that straight forward.


If my 24 words get compromised the security left is only as strong as the passphrase, no? So the passphrase needs to be extremely long and made in a secure way. That's why i thought seed mixing might be even more simple.

Wow, i never thought i would be featured in one of those posts.
First, sorry i was rude to you. I'm very glad it worked out for you.
Just to explain my reaction: at that time we were barely out of the bear market and i hodled through a 85% drop. After the entire year at like $250 the price doubled to $500 in a very short time period and dropped back to $300 like a rock, just as you made your post.
You also didn't specify what amount you invested, i pretty much just reacted based on the headline and assumed you went YOLO all-in with a large amount of money because of the recent 100% rise. Investing $3750 at that time was pretty much risk-reward-sweetspot and as it turned out a very good decision indeed. Kudos to you.
I think my general point still stands though, Bitcoin is a very high risk investment. At current prices maybe more than ever. Invest responsibly (which you did).

Or someone had to create more bitcoins... oh wait.

It's pretty accurate for the 2013 bubble...

Finally relevant again.

I thought companies in China weren't allowed to accept bitcoin through banks? aka the 2013 China-Bitcoin-ban? Did this change now?

Delusion level: over 9000. Bitcoin is HIGH RISK. Don't gamble your daughters futures dude wtf.

People who are willing to pay $20 - $100 for a transaction just don't know there are other ledgers with practically zero fees, one is even more secure than Bitcoin in terms of PoW. 
Informed people are just the first to switch to better methods. Altcoin transaction count is through the roof. This will not end well.
