I cancelled my BFL order too. I understand they may be acting in good faith and if I lived next door to them or knew them personally maybe I would feel differently, But the counterparty risk was just too great. After several delays it comes down to no recourse if they go under. If not, who knows what the mining rates will be by the time you eventually get your hardware. 
This is a Bitcoin problem. No regulation, no insurance, no chargebacks. Same as cash. I don't normally like to give huge wads of cash to people   in exchange for a promise with no recourse. 
I'm sure it will all work out in the end. I have been in gox since I bought my first BTC there for $2. I DID trust them. I am grateful they let me out in Bitcoin. They DO seem to be acting in good faith. But when the governments and banks want to squash a little bug, they usually do.  The beauty of bitcoin is that it seems to be unsquashable. Not so for gox.

I guess that is why I didn't understand. I was 100% in cash. If gox goes down, would my bitcoins be mine or theirs? could they liquidate them? Would the blockchain identify them to me? Would I get them eventually? These are questions I don't want to find out the answers to. I do know if they go down that any fiat would be gone.

I considered all of that. Which is why I gave them the benefit of the doubt  5 weeks ago. But when they lie, that to me is death. Plus, the situation has changed. When I went to cash, I figured I will get my cash before gox goes down and then bitcoin will as you say, become very cheap, and I can buy them back elsewhere. 5 weeks later I had no cash and gox going down is not the same threat it was. People have gotten a lot of bitcoin out, (I was not the first out, I was WAY late and I consider myself to have dodged a bullet), and gox is ALREADY down - dead man walking. Last 24 hours Bitstamp has 50% more trading volume than gox. Gox is no longer the market. Do you think any of those who fled gox are going to ever go back?

Average volume used to be around 25,000 BTC per day. Now it is 7,000. As of right this minute Bitstamp volume is 10,173, Gox is 7,313 for the previous 24 hours. If Gox loses all it's business, it doesn't matter if they want to default or not. Coinlab has $5,000,000 of theirs, the gov't has $3,000,000, give or take. Add litigation and compliance costs and without enough income, they will be out of business whether they want to be or not. 
The prior comment about them being in default NOW is pretty accurate. They are in default in USD, just not in default in BTC yet.

Here's what you should do: Take $10,000 and wire it to Bitstamp or whoever. Buy at current 128 price. Pay about $100 in wire transfer and trading fees. transfer remaining $9,900 in BTC to Mt. Gox. Sell for 10% premium. Now you have $10,890 in Mt. Gox. Have them wire you your $10,890. You just made a $890 profit. Let us know how that works out for you.

The interesting question to me is whether people getting out of Gox are driving up the overall market with all the other exchanges just following the liquidity premium up and up. And what happens if the shit hits the fan and something bad happens at Gox. Is a panic to get out possible? Or is Gox able to process non USD withdrawals enough for arbitrage to keep BTC/USD from going thru the roof on Gox. If Gox goes under, does that crash bitcoin prices because of a loss of confidence? Or is it the opposite, since Gox is really the only place anyone can buy large amounts of Bitcoin without moving the price in a huge way? Does the potential fall of Gox create a lack of liquidity for people wanting to buy Bitcoin and paradoxically move prices higher? Any thoughts?

So yeah, "Get your shit out while you still can". Absolutely.

I did like the little Yubikey dohickey. Ah for the good old days 6 months ago when Gox was invincible, BTC only went up and a free Yubikey came from Japan securing my BTC from everybody (except gox).

I don't understand this comment either.
This business of they can't get any USD out except maybe in a few months is very worrying. Bad shit is happening to them. Seizure, litigation, hugely declining volume, customers like me fleeing. Unless the non-US markets are enough, that leaves GOX with a whole lot of USD on deposit, not much Bitcoin on deposit, low trading volume and a lot of expensive problems. If they go under there is not a damned thing you can do to get your USD from them. It will go to their costs and creditors and too bad for you. Now if Gox trades Bitcoin from their own holdings, that is a whole additional topic. If Gox can't send you your USD, but they can buy Bitcoin from other places, like Bitstamp WITH your USD, then they can make the arbitrage profit and keep any stampede to Bitcoin to get out under control, and profitable to boot. 
At this point there is just too much that is not known about Gox. 
But I have seen other situations end badly. Namely Intrade (got my money out) and Bodog (got my money out). Nobody with any sense should wait for a few months to see if Gox ends badly.

Absolutely true. You take no loss in Goxbucks. Only in USD.

I don't think you have money in gox. When Gox was the market I would have agreed with you. The big players would rescue gox to preserve their VC plays - not necessarily for a "piece of the pie". But now Gox is not the market and "nobody wants to buy a lawsuit" as the saying goes. (Coinlab, US Gov't, etc.). I no longer see anybody coming to rescue gox.

I considered that, having seen it mentioned elsewhere. But there would be some delay in that as well and my fear level just got thru the roof. Not to mention that IF the market is rising (not saying it is, but the day I tried to start my withdrawal it was 120 and now it is 140) that that has to be taken into account as well. When I went to cash I felt a pullback to 90 was likely. As it went to 140 and I sat twiddling my thumbs for a month waiting to get the cash, I wasn't happy. I am feeling a little more bullish (despite my strong preference for buying cheap) and may just stay in bitcoin. Whatever move bitcoin makes is likely to be more important than the savings from a "priority withdrawal" which could still take days or ????. Basically I told GOX I had been waiting a month and they gave me a canned "there is a two week backlog" response and I researched and saw NOBODY getting any $$$ out. To me the "two weeks" was a lie and at that point my money could have been gone for good. I appreciate gox cancelled the wire transfers so I could go to bitcoin and get out but I am super happy to be out of gox. It was to the point where I really couldn't think of anything else so sometimes 90% is a lot better than the possibility of 0%.
