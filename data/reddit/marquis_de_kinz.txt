Same, i crossed the whole country from top to bottom and back up. Not seen a singl sign of BTC adoption

No "fees" but a ridiculous spread

Which he's so good at explaining to...
@_date: 2019-10-14 04:41:17
So where are we at in the cycle right now?
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:29:39
Can't argue with that
@_date: 2019-10-13 20:21:31
Well it just crashed 300$...

Engraved? I was wondering about this earlier. How did you engrave the seed? Because I'd like to do the same, but wouldnt want to provide the actual seed phrases to a stranger to get it done
@_date: 2019-10-17 04:50:31
Wouldn't this also mean that there is this underlying potential for the price to crash really hard if all of a sudden big stack holders started selling off their BTC?

Touchy much? You answered your own question, they are **new**

Well if he cashes out, it's not a "truly private currency". So technically it wasn't the answer he was looking for, but my point still holds.

Depends on the tax Group you're in. But Yeah... Taxes are ridiculous over here. It's enraging! Even more So if you Look at how Taxes are spent by the state...

How many times do we have to look at this shitty meme? Sometimes,... most times, if you have nothing productive to contribute, it is best to contribute nothing.
Show me an interesting paper, some research on the impact of cryptocurrency on our societies, or a link to an article... Anything productive/interesting/insightful really. Something that let's me come out smarter than I came in. Not this mental diarrhea that has been posted and reposted a thousand times.

Just the first one. And only if the Account the money got sent from is tied to a german or austrian bank
@_date: 2019-12-28 14:56:53
You don't. Instead, you spend it directly
@_date: 2019-12-21 22:12:25
Again avoiding to adress his question. You  would do just fine as a politician
@_date: 2019-12-19 10:50:45
Judging by the size I'd say at least 3

Although kraken demands a Selfie with paper to confirm id no matter what.
