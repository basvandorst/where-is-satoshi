What if the Satoshi key died with Kleiman but Craig was still involved in bitcoin's inception? He's maybe overstepping his claims but it's possible that the truth lies somewhere in between him being a complete fraud and him being the sole inventor.

In his own blog post  Gavin indicates that he may have lost his skepticism by the time of the demonstration. 


In this mentality, critical evaluation could be very difficult.

In the leaked documents to Gizmodo and Wired, it's interesting that no connection was established between Hal Finney and Craig Wright, or Hal Finney and David Kleiman (except through Satoshi, by Hal Finney's accounts). But since they've both given up the ghost, it can explain the bold move by Craig to claim he is Satoshi, because he knows he is the sole member alive that can make the claim.

Or maybe the different members of Team Satoshi were in it for different reasons to begin with. Some for the technical challenge, some for the social implications, and some to jump in on the mining game early in the hopes that the currency would take off.
Considering the unlikely combination of Finney/Kleiman/Wright, it seems like a likely explanation.
@_date: 2016-05-05 11:05:53
They key died with Dave Kleiman/Hal Finney.
Maybe CSW was more frank with them.

[Possible that he is deliberately obfuscating proof to discredit himself and trying to throw extortionists off?](
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:02:48
He could be the deceptive bad apple in the Team of Satoshi.  [my hypothesis](
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:16:38
Yes, there is allusion to Kleiman's death having occurred under unusual circumstances. 
Kleiman holding the wallets make sense, but seems strange that CW tries to pretend that's not the case.

You could say many instances of open source software have people's productivity (leading to revenue) tied up - OpenOffice, Java, Linux, etc. So stakes are quite can be quite high.
It's true that they do have foundations or backing of corporations though, but there is also a lot of bickering leading to forking and introduction of many distros. 
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:14:20
Wow, very well articulated.
Though if Satoshi's identity were indeed Craig Wright, it seems he would not have a very strong following as a decider at this point. It seems likely he was involved in the Satoshi Team, but may have been the least technically competent and least likeable member...
But I think Andreas's point is that it *shouldn't* matter and we should no longer care. Yet it does because people need an origin story. However, under these circumstances I'm not sure the impact of the persona will be much greater than initial disappointment. Though knowing who possesses the single largest collection bitcoins  might help a little to predict its volatility.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:04:59
Fair enough.

I approve this typo.

Who says you need a degree to be knowledgable about a subject?

Even bad PR is good PR?

He can himself be convinced beyond *any* doubt, but could still be fooled in reality. I guess it's more a semantic question of whose doubt are we talking about - I assume any level of doubt that GA can sustain.
@_date: 2016-05-03 16:35:06
It seems like it would take someone with CW's big and elusive personality to push this visionary cryptocurrency out there in the first place.
But as a mouthpiece, CW's writing style, attention to detail, and persona seems very different, though.


I wonder how plausible this is.
His knowledge seems to point he was involved somehow; definitely not as sole inventor but somewhere in the loop. I think the world is disappointed to find this hero a flawed character who seems to be in it for personal gain rather than altruistic reasons that the world had hoped "Satoshi" to have. So regardless of what proof he shows, we will continue to doubt. Because we can, and we want to.
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:25:14
I guess I'm going on his intimate knowledge of Bitcoin's inception that was enough to convince Gavin.
@_date: 2016-05-06 14:26:15
Thanks for the clarification - I was confused.
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:17:58
Again, he may be able to assuage his own doubts and still be factually incorrect.
@_date: 2016-05-06 13:28:57
Wasn't Hal Finney involved with PGP development and was active at that time?
@_date: 2016-05-04 18:18:23
He was linked to from a [BBC follow-up post]( but I haven't seen anyone else press him about it (at least publicly). Is this a thing?
@_date: 2016-05-03 08:02:31
These statements can in fact coexist in the space of logic:




He can be personally convinced but be duped at the same time.
The most likely explanation for possible error in GA's evaluation comes his own blog post 


His skepticism has been suppressed and so it's not surprising that he may not have been as critical as he could allow himself to be at this point.

There could have been one asshole on the Satoshi Team that played well for perceived future gain.
@_date: 2016-05-04 14:14:27
I agree totally.
Is there advantage with the ATO for CSW claim that he is the primary Satoshi and the bitcoins belong entirely to himself, or no?
@_date: 2016-05-03 17:22:07
Yes, and yet there could have been elements of truth. Craig Wright could have been involved in the first team and corresponded with Gavin in some instances. He may not have the full technical competence of the other team members so he's struggling now (or he doesn't have the original key), but at least in conversation part of it could have been genuine.
