No, the smart-traders will get rewarded at the end. Let me give you a small example between a associate of mine and myself.
I discovered a alt-coin around Feb-March(fuzzy memory) called Ravencoin it was virtually unknown at this point, but doing some digging i knew i hit the jackpot it had ties too Overstock.com.. I quietly mined this coin for around 2 months with this other individual. It proceeded to go from 80 satoshi too 900+ satoshi while BTC was maintaining a price of $10-11k. I Sold 80% of my portion around 700-800 satoshi.
I netted 6 figures and a huge smile on my face while the associate of mine decided to 'hodl' he could of easily cashed out around $400k but now its worth around $100k at most. At anytime if i wished i can rejoin Raven(trading around 240 satoshi now?) and get 4x the amount for the exact same price. Hodling is a pipe-dream.. just cause you sell doesn't mean you can't rebuy back in... i don't understand the mentality of morons like yourself, but thanks for buying my bags i guess lol.
