Wait... so lots of small buys don't affect Bitcoin going up... but lots of people FUDing and selling makes the price drop? Make up your mind... Do you think the big whales are catching FUD from little guys?
@_date: 2018-01-02 22:36:41
It's going to be a hard mental hurdle for people to get over. Everyone seems to want Bitcoin to hit $20k... nobody wants to BUY Bitcoin at $20k.
@_date: 2018-01-03 01:21:53
Short answer.. nobody knows. You're basically asking us to predict Bitcoin value in the future...
If it were that easy we'd all be millionaires. Do your own research and invest if you feel comfortable and think it's a good time to invest. Is now a good time to invest? I don't know... it's different for everybody. If you think Bitcoin is going to hit 20k per coin, yeah why wouldn't you invest right now? If you think it's going to fluctuate around $15k for months... then maybe don't buy? You didn't miss the ship if it jumped nearly 10% in a day just now... 
People have been thinking they missed a chance for the past several years... Just jump in and get your feet wet. Put in what you're willing to lose and just hold until you get a return you're happy with.

With how volatile it is I'm honestly surprised people still think they can day trade long term successfully. An 80 cent coin today might be worth 90 cents tomorrow, or 70 cents... or it could go up to $2 overnight... How are you supposed to predict this stuff? Magic? It's called volatile for a reason.
You could be happily buying/selling for 1-2% gains per day, and then go to buy back in the next morning after selling on a dip, and see that it rose 10% overnight. Now what? It now costs you more to get back in the game, and you don't know if it will grow 10% more or drop back down to where it was the night before. Yes, every growth is going to have a dip... but knowing when that dip comes is basically impossible.
Unless you find some coin that is dropping and rising 10% or more each day, and you take advantage of that for weeks, then you're going to miss out when it shoots to the moon and goes way over what you were trading for.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:24:47
I bought at $4k and it went up to $19k and I didn't sell. I guess I'm dumb. I couldn't predict it would go up $15k more and then stop dead. If only I knew it would more than quadruple in value but not quintuple before dropping.... dang. I guess I should have never bought at $4k...
@_date: 2018-01-22 03:34:40


Might want to mention this in your initial post...
@_date: 2019-07-08 01:42:50
I think I'm really just trying to say that you shouldn't buy on an impulse. Do research. Find out if the current price is fluctuating a lot and then make sure not to jump in on the investment when there's too much going on with it. When it jumps up 20% overnight, that's not the time to jump in. Unless your plan is to buy and quickly try to sell at the high point (dangerous gamble) then the best time to invest is not when it's seeing crazy daily swings.
If you have faith that BTC will be worth way more some day, then it's better to buy when it's dropping. It's a discount buy then, not an irrational buy based on emotion or fomo.
@_date: 2019-07-11 18:27:16
Dude, I made so much money off of Funko Pops you don't even want to know. Not even joking.
I bought up everything early on and then 5 years later they are hundreds of dollars a piece. If I could go back in time but not be able to invest in Bitcoin, I'd 100% go all in on Funko Pop Chase figures. $10 figure selling for $300 in 5 years? I'll buy a few thousand and retire in 5 years time.
@_date: 2019-07-12 01:02:45


I don't really think so. Funko Pop aren't exactly the same as Beanie Babies... The main difference is that Beanie Babies were intentionally manipulated to have rarities and their value was really just based on how rare the plush was, and not so much any sort of actual value for the person who bought it.
With Funko Pops, as you stated, they have their hands in nearly every franchise... What this means is that these figures generally mean more to the people buying them, because the figures represent a loved character for that person. Beanie Babies were literally just various animal plush with different colors and styles.  
A Batman figure or a Luke Skywalker figure is very personal to the person buying it. They like that character specifically... so there's more value there.
I don't think the value of Funko Pop figures will just crash out of nowhere. There's too much demand for the different properties for that to happen. I think they will reach a tipping point in terms of price, but it's more like they will just sort of hit a price point that people just aren't willing to pay. So the real trick is to just make sure you're not buying them for that maximum value price point.
I don't think they will continue to rise in price over the decades but instead just flatten out with maybe a few going up or down a bit from their "settled value".
Again, Beanie Babies was like an overnight craze. People bought them purely to get rich quick. People buy Funko Pop figures for much of the same reason, but that's only a small portion of the people buying them. Most people buying them just like the figure, like how it looks, like the character, etc. So the chance of a Beanie Baby level crash is pretty much non-existent.

Would that matter? I don't think they are legally obligated to fill your Bitcoin order. Just because you want x amount of Bitcoins at x price doesn't mean they have to deliver that to you. They gave OP his money back... so no harm done. He lost out on potential earnings but all he's really going to get out of suing them is a big attorney bill.
@_date: 2018-01-03 00:26:15
Just think of all that potential bitcoin you missed out on by not constantly selling at highs and buying at lows throughout that entire journey! You could be a billionaire right now if only you could go back in time and give your past self a printout of the price graph for the past 2-3 years!

You can buy it through binance but you need to buy it using btc, ltc or eth... So you can buy those somewhere else and transfer them over.
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:30:14
It's meant as a cryptocurrency... sure... but people have been buying it to make money since its release. It isn't fair to say that isn't what it's meant to be. It can be both.
Why do people buy gold? To make money. Why do some people buy houses or land and just sit on them? To make money. All of that has other uses too... but money can be made from them.
I don't think it's a Ponzi scheme considering anyone can benefit by investing in it at any given time. It has its ups and downs. If Bitcoin climbs up to $100k per coin... people who jumped in even now will benefit greatly from it. It's a gamble, yes... but so are most high risk high reward investments.
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:40:41
But... what if it grows 3x-4x in another few years? You could be looking at a cool million instead of 250k. :)
I guess my motto is that I'm only going to sell when the money is pretty life changing... Like quit my job type of money. I'd hate to get out and find out I could have just retired off my investments in 5-10 years instead of waiting 20-30.
@_date: 2017-12-31 08:29:59
That moment when the price goes from 15k to 20k and doesn't come back down... and you sold at 15k while other people held... Then all the sudden they have far more earnings.
You could play a dangerous game of buying and selling constantly hoping you time things correctly... or you could just buy early and hold... and never have to worry about selling at the wrong time.
If you could so easily predict the dips and rises you would be a billionaire right now. No reason you wouldn't be... Because you're so confident you could just invest every penny you have into Bitcoin when it's low, sell when it rises, invest all that back when it hits a low point again, etc... You should now be a multi millionaire... Something tells me you aren't.

How would you suggest I measure it?
I spent USD to buy the bitcoins... so of course I'm going to measure it to USD. Why wouldn't I? The fact nobody is saying anything about tether? You mean you read a few articles speculating something and now you're concerned everyone doesn't know about it too? Because it may or may not happen?
I'm concerned nobody is saying anything about Cthulhu coming down from the sky tomorrow and obliterating life as we know it... nobody is talking about it but I swear I read somewhere about how it's going to happen... so since nobody else is talking about it I guess we're just all doomed.
@_date: 2017-12-29 08:26:02
I think the problem is you're making it sound like it's more likely to plummet to zero than not. "Quite possible" is a bit of a stretch. "Very small possibility" is more like it.
I think most people understand that investing in cryptocurrency is a gamble... but I think most people would have the sense to sell at some point if it dropped down to almost nothing.
I know that I bought in for a certain amount and if Bitcoin drops down close to that amount I'd just cash out and be up instead of waiting for it to drop below what I bought in for. I'm in until it starts losing value for me... so I'm not too concerned with it hitting zero because I'd cash out long before that.
@_date: 2017-12-27 05:36:01
So what is the likelihood of Bitcoin hitting zero? If you can't do the math, don't make the claim. Right now you're just saying "it's possible" which is exactly the same as saying a nuclear war is  "possible".
@_date: 2017-12-28 20:36:18
It follows nearly the same curve as BTC and ETH... compare the graphs. If BTC goes up, LTC goes up. If BTC goes down, LTC goes down. How many vendors accept it? You could say that about any of these speculative cryptocurrencies.
It's odd that you single out LTC as it's had more overall growth in the past month than any of the top cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-23 04:37:42
Well, Jan 10 is less than a month away so I guess we won't have to wait long for you to be more than likely wrong. Just from the fact that you're calling it "dead" if it gets below $200... and it wasn't even $200 a month ago, tells me you are being overly dramatic.
I guess it's a good thing I bought my LTC when it was at $53 a coin. I guess even if it's "dead" I'm still profiting.
@_date: 2018-09-05 23:06:52
No thanks
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:06:18
Well everyone except the cynical people who think it's a ponzi scheme... :)
I'm not saying just buy bitcoins either... Buying into other crypto currency in its early stages could potentially make you rich in a few years time. It took Bitcoin what... 5-6 years to blow up this big? It's because more people finally discovered it and invested in it. If one of these potentially better crypto currencies becomes popular, we could see a similar growth in a much shorter span of time.
$1000 in a $1 crypto now could be a $2,000,000 snowball if another currency ever hits the $20k mark.
@_date: 2018-08-15 17:49:40
Does anyone think this could really affect the trade volume? I know I would have loved to sell my bitcoin at times and buy back in at times but the idea of waiting days/weeks for the bitcoin to fiat conversion was always what stopped me.
It's been easier to just hold my btc instead of selling and buying back in on Coinbase.
@_date: 2018-08-09 19:53:21
I honestly think a lot of people really are just FUDDing though. A lot of inexperienced people see the numbers dropping and they think the ship is sinking so they spread that fear everywhere. A lot of "this is it for Bitcoin" type posts are actually people who believe that, and want someone to tell them otherwise.
@_date: 2018-08-08 17:09:40
It's not like the money vanished. It went to someone else.
@_date: 2019-11-27 05:22:09
No pin on phone, coin base account set to auto-login, no 2FA.... AND he left $7000 on Coinbase just sitting there.
Lesson learned, I hope? It's like leaving a stack of $7000 sitting in the locker room and hoping nobody takes it.
Like... I was dumb enough to leave my money on an exchange for way too long but at least my phone is password protected and I have 2FA set up on Coinbase. After a scare where someone got access to my e-mail and tried to get into my Coinbase account, I moved all my money to a hardware wallet.
Keeping your money on Coinbase is just really really dumb. When I contacted Coinbase to warn them that someone was attempting to gain access to my account, they just locked me out of my account entirely and it took me weeks to get back in to retrieve my money. The guy was literally trying to get my 2FA changed by trying to fake a photo ID and claim he was me.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:25:42
Your entire strategy relies on reading charts after the charts already exist. You can't read the future. You say people who bought at $7600 "fucked up". You say they "should've bought at 7k". But you only *know* this because it's happened already. It's easy to say what someone should have done when you can look at the charts after the fact.
I'm just confused as to how you can say "I try not to predict the future - I'm interested in the here and now"... Because isn't that the way you make money? Trying to predict what will happen? It's impossible to know if Bitcoin is going to end up or down on any given day. So how do you know when to buy or sell? It's all a guessing game but you speak with authority like there's some simple system in place that lets you profit all the time.
Again, anyone can look at past charts and say "here's where you should have bought and sold" this doesn't make you an investment genius, it makes you a person who can point out the obvious.
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:38:42
It hit probably hundreds of thousands of all time highs over the course of it's existence so far. Considering it could go up pennies in value at any given moment.
@_date: 2018-06-14 21:20:35


Not by the people who are trying to get others to invest in it... Is that hard to understand? The people saying "Bitcoin is gonna blow up! buy now!" are just people who bought bitcoin at a low price and want it to be worth more. They didn't invent Bitcoin.


There's no vision from early investors... they just want more money. Most don't care about the tech. They just want more people to buy Bitcoin so that the value goes up.


Because of the product he created. Not because he also just invested a bunch of money in something. Wow... does your brain work? Seriously I'm really curious how you can't see the difference here.
One guy actually created a website, got investors to help push it farther, and then profited from his hard work and dedication. A random early Bitcoin investor created nothing, did nothing other than buy some Bitcoin, and now is trying to get others to invest so that the value of their purchased Bitcoin goes up. That's it. Pyramid scheme.
Bitcoin itself isn't a pyramid scheme, but the concept of early adoption and then convincing others to buy in order to drive up the value of what you own is 100% a pyramid scheme. If you buy 100 bitcoins for some price and then get thousands of people to raise the price, and then you sell your bitcoin at a profit, you essentially just took the money from those people like a scam.
"Look at all the value this coin is going to have! Invest!"
*coin gains value and you sell*
"Well it had value until I sold and then it dropped! Sorry!"
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:42:33
You mean the small percentage of early adopters are benefiting the most? and then the larger percentage of people that come in later won't benefit anywhere near as much? So basically like a small point that grows outward over time to form the shape of a triangle.
When I think of triangles, I think of pyramids... now what sort of scheme has early adopters benefiting by encouraging others to adopt in later? Hard to put my finger on the term used...
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:21:24


Eh... again, easier said than done. If I buy a coin for $100 and then it goes up $101... do I sell for profit? People have thresholds of how much they'd like to earn back... At some point you're going to buy and the price is going to drop more... and more... and more... and then what? Unless you're saying we should know when something is going to drop.
How about people who just bought bitcoin at like $7600 hoping it would go up a few hundred dollars and then they would sell? Then it plummets down nearly $1000 and is sitting at around that right now. How does your advice work for them? If bitcoin goes back up to $7700 do you advise they sell then? Even if that might take several weeks/months? Even if it's showing trends of climbing up for the next few weeks to $10000?
You make it sound so easy... and that's why I have to argue with you. Because if it were so easy to invest in crypto for profit, literally everyone should be profiting. It's insulting when people just stroll in and say "buy dips and sell highs" or even "just sell when you're at a profit, duh!" because it's never that straight forward.
@_date: 2018-06-12 19:16:02
Not really the same... he created something. He had a vision. He wasn't running around asking people to invest in Facebook so that he could get richer off of each person who joined the fold. He had to put in work and actually do something. Pyramid schemes are simply "I invested in this thing early and now I need to convince others to invest in it too so the value of it goes up and I can cash out and leave them holding the bags."
@_date: 2018-06-11 19:48:33
You must be a billionaire by now with this strategy... Sell on the bounce each time! Brilliant! Now if only we knew where the top of the bounce was so we could do that... I mean that's really easy to say when you look at an old graph. "There is when you should have sold"
Not so easy when you're looking at the current graph and don't know where the line will be tomorrow.
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:02:55
Yeah you have to consider early on in Bitcoin's life, people bought a few hundred Bitcoin and then lost track of it or forgot they ever bought it, and it's unlikely to be recovered. Even today if you just lost your wallet info your Bitcoin are just floating around in limbo.

@_date: 2019-06-29 07:14:09
It really isn't fine because you're losing so much value for your dollar.  
Sure, it might seem fine buying in at 19k if you plan to hold until it's 50k. But you could have bought over 5 entire coins for that same price if you waited to buy at $3500. So is it really fine? If he waited 24 hours he could have bought a full bitcoin for $3,000 less and used that $3,000 extra to buy even more bitcoin. He could have had nearly 1.25 bitcoin for the same money.
Buying high means you also have to wait longer to see profit.  People who bought at 19k are still waiting.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:28:08
The farther it goes up, the more chance it has to be red later on
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:35:00
lol... pretty sure someone said exactly this when it ran up to 19k... and then plummeted down to 3k.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:32:34
I mean you say no losses but yet here you are saying how you lost out on profits because you sold.  
So why buy now? Do you think it's going up? Just because it's literally on an upswing at the moment? It's gonna dip down again eventually. Buy on the downswing, not the upswing. This is common sense. Don't make the same mistake people made last time where they were panic buying at 18k thinking it was gonna just go up forever and then being stuck with their BTC when it dropped to 3k. This massive jump up is temporary. A correction has to come.
What you're doing is literally investing via FOMO which is a terrible way to invest.
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:25:10
If you bought BTC for $13k in 2019 there's no way you're gonna be driving a Lambo in 2 years.... unless you bought several BTC in which case you're looking at spending upwards of $39,000 and you're probably not sweating it anyway.
Nobody buying 1/8th of a BTC at $13,000 is gonna be a millionaire from BTC in 2 years.
@_date: 2019-06-26 00:34:16
It's gonna correct eventually. Give it time. This is the same scenario where it went from 11k up to 19k and people were unsure when to sell or buy.
Buy if you think BTC is currently undervalued. That's really all there is to it. Do research and figure out where BTC should be in a few years. Is it more than it is now? Then buy. Is it less? Then sell.
@_date: 2019-04-02 19:03:05
I mean 1 BTC right now is like $4000 so it's not some extraordinarily out of reach amount. I'm not sure why anyone should be proud of holding 1 BTC at the moment... Unless you're really broke and own 0.001 BTC or something.

But cold storage costs money... that 40k-100k is going to dry up... and then what? You're dead and can't pay to keep your body frozen. You know what they do? They thaw you out and probably just incinerate the whole deal. Also if the company goes under for whatever reason... what happens to your body then? Most businesses don't survive several decades let alone possible hundreds of years before there's a safe way to revive a frozen body and make you healthy again. Even if they have the tech to unfreeze you, there's no guarantee they will have the tech to fix whatever your cause of death was in the first place.
But hey, I mean it's still better than just rotting in the ground... if you really want to come back to life again.
@_date: 2018-03-09 21:36:28
Haha I mean yeah at some point in the future people won't want Bitcoin anymore... but that could be when we're all long dead... It could be 5 years from now or 500... It could be when the Sun is about to die and nobody wants Bitcoin anymore because there isn't a point. I'm not arguing semantics with you. I'm arguing that you can't predict what everyone is going to want in the future. If so you should currently be a billionaire because you could have predicted that Bitcoin would spike up to $19000 because you apparently know what people want.
@_date: 2018-03-09 20:58:14
Easy money... you just have to predict that it will go up at least $1000 within your lifetime... No problem!
Here's the dilemma: Where do you buy in? Anywhere? What if you bought in at $19k waiting for it to hit $20k? Welp... guess you've been waiting for months now.
Say you buy in at $8890 and it just never hits $9900 for the rest of the year... Then what? Lets say it hits $9900 and you cash out your easy money... When do you buy back in? You wait for it to drop back down to $8800? What if it doesn't do that for months? If you could know where the bottom/middle of a steady rise/fall was... then you could just nonstop make money investing in crypto.
This just isn't the case. Your entire strategy relies on the price going up by $1000 within a reasonably short amount of time, so that you can sell at a nice profit... but then your plan also has to rely on the price plummeting back down so you're not buying it at $9900 or more... as it just gets more expensive and eventually will stop climbing and you'll be stuck.
Also... what currency are you selling bitcoin for? If it's not cash, then there's no guarantee the other crypto you sell to won't go down with bitcoin... in fact it's highly likely. So you can't sell BTC for say... ETH... because it will probably drop just as much.
If you're selling BTC for cash... well have fun being taxed on every profit and also eating fees on every transaction.

@_date: 2018-02-07 22:13:16
The issue with this mentality is that if you're thinking something is going to be worth something 50 years from now... it won't be.
The things that hold value after many decades are usually things that nobody thought would be worth anything in the future. Comic books from the 50s are worth tons because no kids back then thought about preserving them... Comic books from the 90s are worth jack squat because everyone bought up all the  issues and protected them in sleeves thinking they'd be worth millions. They are worth less now than their original price in some cases.
If too many people get the idea of preserving something for future profits, then there's going to be an abundance of that something in the future so the price won't change.

That's a silly fact though. Sure both are 5x your investment... but what actually matters is how much you bought.
He spent like $100 and sold for roughly $500... making a whopping $400 profit.
Buying even 1 coin at $4k and selling at $20k is a $16,000 profit. Just a slight bit of difference there.
It boggles my mind that people don't realize going from 6 cents to 30 cents is not a huge leap compared to going from $4000 to $20000. It's about scale, not just "it's the same because it's multiplied the same amount!"
There's a reason TRX is trading at like fractions of a cent difference... because it's worth a whole $0.02 so if it were to suddenly go up to 10 cents someone could have been a millionaire if they bought enough of it at 0.02
That's not really likely to happen though, or everyone would be doing it.

It dips every day, but not necessarily back down to the amount you sold at. If you sell at 10k and then it goes up to 10.5... then dips to 10.2... then back up to 10.5... where do you buy? Then it goes up 5k more... where do you buy? You wait for it to dip back down to 10k months later? You're out of the game for months?
You make no sense. Obviously in hindsight you can see the dips but when you sell you can't possibly know a dip will surely come that will be lower than your sell price within the next few weeks. You could be waiting a long time to get back into the game.

The whole paradox with people regretting selling or not buying bitcoin before it blew up is that had everyone bought it or not sold it back then, it wouldn't have reached anywhere near the insane amount per coin that it reached.
It made overnight millionaires BECAUSE only a few people held when it was that low. It's like first edition comic books from the 50s and 60s... They are worth tons because most people didn't think to preserve them or hold on to them. It's the same concept. Had you held on to all of your first issue comics and kept them mint... you'd be rich right now... But you didn't, because... not many people did... and THAT is why they have value.
Bitcoin is quite similar in that there's a limited amount, and for a long period of time people didn't see value in Bitcoin... then the value increased a lot... and the few people who didn't waver actually benefited. Now you have the people jumping into Bitcoin like people jumped into buying all the  issues of comics in the 90s. You might turn a small profit short term but you won't ever see those astronomical gains because the ship has sailed.
The trick is to find something limited that people aren't valuing enough right now... and predicting that people will value that in the future. Then stockpile the heck out of that thing while it's cheap and then wait.

The government doesn't care if you're off by a few dollars... they just want their cut. Not paying any taxes on it at all is going to get you in a world of hurt. Just giving you a heads up now. Saying "it was super hard to track!" is not going to cut it when the government audits you.

I mean... it also has all the hallmarks of the run up to over $19k back in Nov/Dec too... Just depends on your outlook. You don't want history to repeat itself... when it's bad. But you do want history to repeat itself when it's good... so uh... just hold on and see what happens?
Also I mean if you think it's going to the moon and you put your life savings into it... what is a setback to 5.8k going to matter? Unless you sell at 5.8k then you're totally fine. You could buy 100 Bitcoin right now and not lose a single dollar if you only sell when it's worth the same or more.
Even if Bitcoin dropped to $100, as long as you don't sell, you don't lose money.

So what you're saying is go further into credit card debt to put 10x more money into bitcoin so he can be a millionaire by 2020... gotcha!

It's implied. I mean what is the point of knowing if people think it will continue to go up? It doesn't give you any useful information to ask that, unless you're going to base your investments on what people "think" is going to happen. You're literally asking for their prediction... so it might as well be fortune telling.
If enough people think it will go up... what does that matter to you? Again... are you going to invest more if you get enough "yes" responses? The only conclusion I can come to is that you're basing your investments off of what other people think will happen.

I mean you can think this about any sharp rise... But it's silly to think this way because like... why now? If there are players large enough to manipulate the market, why pick today to do it? What's significant about it? Why wouldn't they manipulate the market at this scale more frequently? If they can drive up Bitcoin 10% overnight, why not do this once a week and really cash in? They know when to pump and when to dump, so there's no risk. So yeah, doesn't really make sense when you think about it...
Unless you're trying to say that they wait months and months until the "time is right".
@_date: 2018-07-24 22:48:01
You're asking people if they can literally see the future. No. Nobody here knows what Bitcoin is going to do. We can only make predictions... Which are useless, because ultimately what you choose to do is either right or wrong. It's a gamble.

And... you don't think the whales believe they can drive up Bitcoin over 20k at this point? I mean... you can't be scared of whales cashing out all the time. It's bound to eventually happen. It isn't market manipulation... they just have a big piece of the pie... so when they decide to sell, it hurts everyone. What can anyone really do about that?
The "whales" are just trying to profit like everyone else. They have way more skin in the game... so it makes sense they'd want to play it a bit safer. They aren't going to drop millions into bitcoin and then wait for some other whale to sell first and be out millions when the price drops.

It's funny because I hadn't checked the price in a day... and it was at $8200 last time I checked... I saw this meme and though "oh boy, I guess it nose-dived"... so I checked and it's at... $8200... it basically bounced back before I even saw it drop

Just hope you don't end up like the guy who spent like a dozen bitcoins for a pizza back in the day. :) Glad to see someone using it as currency though... and someone accepting it.
I just don't think I can be that free with my bitcoin spending when the price is hopping all over the place.

It could certainly go under 8000 but it also could certainly not... and go up to 30k and you miss the boat. The point is to buy when nobody else is... That's when you should invest. Not when it jumped 10% overnight. But before the jump. At this point it's already "too late" to get in on the juicy early profit from the current spike. At best you are gambling now.

No shit. Didn't say it was a smart thing to do.

I was dumb to leave my money on Coinbase and at one point someone obtained access to my e-mail and was trying to get access to my Coinbase account... going as far as trying to create a fake ID to get my 2FA changed. So I took precautions and contacted Coinbase to say that someone had breached my e-mail account but that I secured it, and to just be on alert for someone to attempt to claim they are me and trying to change my 2FA.
So what does Coinbase do? Locks my account completely. I contact them saying "no, I just wanted you to be vigilant if someone contacts you in the near future claiming to be me and wanting to change my 2FA". It took me weeks of e-mailing back and forth and showing my ID and providing account details in order for them to unlock my account that I never asked them to lock.
You can bet I transferred every last bit of money I had on Coinbase to a hardware wallet shortly after that.

As long as you hold and not panic sell then you haven't lost anything yet. People fail to realize this way too much.
If you bought at $18k or something and held until now, just wait because within a year it's bound to break over $20k and then you will be up instead of down. :)

I bought a Ledger Nano directly from their website. Make sure you buy directly from them. Don't trust third party suppliers as they could tamper with the hardware. The website has good instructions on how to set everything up. You can also google some how to videos on how to transfer money from Coinbase to a Ledger device.
First time using a hardware wallet and it was really simple to understand and set up. Just make sure you're recovery word sheet is blank when you get it, and write down the words the device gives you. Those 20 words are crucial to keep safe and secure because that's the only way to restore your wallet if you lose or destroy the hardware wallet that you have.  
Anyone selling you a wallet that already has a word list is just looking to scam you out of your money, because they will wait for you to load up the wallet and then use the word list they provided you to access the wallet and clean you out. The word list should be for you and you alone, and you're the one generating it from the wallet itself.
