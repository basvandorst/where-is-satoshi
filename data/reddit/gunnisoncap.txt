I sent 0.5BTC from my Ledger to Binance for $1 fee to see what happened, fully aware I might be taking action if it stuck in perpetuity in the mempool.
Cheap but it took 5 days to arrive.. cannot WAIT for Lightening mainnet adoption. Everybody please get nodes up and push for exchanges and wallets to adopt.

Only speculators focus overridingly on price because they plan to cash out.
For various project communities I am involved with I care about their success and that’s how it should absolutely be with Bitcoin. 
The challenge for 2018 for this community is pushing through the required changes to sort out the transaction volume, scaling and (currently ridiculous) fee issues.
That is what is making BTC only a store of value as its big proposition right now instead of an effective digital currency.  That is why price is the primary focus here - you care about how much your bar of gold is worth because that’s all it’s there for. If Bitcoin was being used more transactionally we would be continually buying and selling in it so spending and reacquiring.
At present the velocity of money in BTC terms is awful with mentality that somebody who paid 20 BTC for something 4yrs ago made a huge mistake.  No, if you kept all your money in BTC and thus every bit of fiat were transferring back to reacquire more BTC then spending it on things too is right and what Satoshi designed it for.
Hodling is a mentality for a store of value proposition only, not a usable currency.  This community needs to decide whether it wants to be a currency too, because if not others are stepping up to supersede it for that function rightly.

What gives Bitcoin its value is perceived authenticity (as a currency) that fuels its demand, and assured scarcity.  The latter is inherent in all coins, but they lack any perceived authenticity and accordingly the ecosystem dies off eventually from lack of usage.

That's a fair point although widespread and long term usage is a consequence of authenticity. In effect without it, nobody uses a token.

Best part about the correction is the chance to reuse this one!

You're on the money, I work in the area and fair to say volatility is how we make money. The crypto markets are a beautiful swing for long and shorting, if there's a sharp drop it's just a transfer of money between people. One persons loss is another's gain at their expense.
