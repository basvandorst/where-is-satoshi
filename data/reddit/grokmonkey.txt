And I have no idea what the catch is. It's an intriguing concept, but I refuse to participate without even a vague, "big-picture" idea of why someone would bother and why it's actually worth physical goods/services.

I disagree.
Besides, even under the 'correct' definition, I'd argue it is still fiat money as it derives its value entirely by the governance of the bitcoin system and the claim by the bitcoin system that it is worth anything. I really don't see any distinction between a physical group deciding arbitrary worth and a non-physical group doing the same.

It's not uncommon to use the term fiat money less literally, as I was doing. I understand the literal definition well.
I understand the block system as well (conceptually, anyways). It's just something so totally *new*. Because of it, depending on how far Bitcoin ends up reaching, it could be merely novel, well utilized technology, or a revolutionary tool of dark-nets.

Okay, now which am I describing: USD or BTC?
@_date: 2011-06-13 03:20:16
I understand. Just illustrating the definition I was going off of, as well as that it's accepted by Merriam-Webster. Probably should've noted that in that post, but you know what they say about hindsight.

Don't fret, I understand all of that. I was merely trying to illustrate I was going off of a less literal definition to begin with and the less literal definition was widely accepted (or at least accepted by Merriam-Webster, but they're usually used as the benchmark for this sort of thing).

Yes, I understand that much. But it claims not to be fiat money, yet seems to have no worth other than an arbitrary value, meaning it *is* fiat money. If it truly *isn't* fiat money, then something truly massive is going on behind the scenes that no one seems to be aware of, which would be worrying to say the least.
And the block/mining system is also strange, though it is a fantastic, smart way to verify existing bitcoin and intrinsically account for what's going on with the currency.
