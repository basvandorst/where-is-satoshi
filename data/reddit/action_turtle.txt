Perhaps not getting Fiat rammed down their throats will allow come kind of growth, and get them out of this madness.
I’m not sure they should be putting it all on this petro coin, but moving to crypto should pay off eventually. I hope it all works out, and they lead the way for other small nations to follow
@_date: 2018-01-23 21:15:50
Good. Gambling 200coins, at this price, is just for greed. You are a millionaire already.

Raspberry pi is a nice idea, but might be complicated for users. You just want to pull the board game out and load up the app... I was thinking along the lines of running the ledger on all the phones connected over WiFi, or just a simple shared database on one users phone, and it just pings that with simple data...
@_date: 2018-01-06 22:10:08
Ah cool!
Sorry, I mean having the phones go with the game. So in monopoly you use paper, and in new versions they give you a credit card with reader, but in this crypto game you can use your mobile to keep track of your money/transactions
@_date: 2018-01-17 12:47:26

... yes, we agree, but until fees get down into the pennies it will not be a currency.
Not really sure what people are expecting at this point. Unless fees plummet, bitcoin will be nothing more than a market savings account

@_date: 2018-01-06 22:48:51
I’ve not seen that game, I’ll look it up.
Personally I’d stay away from online services, as it becomes ‘a thing’. Server maintenance, hosting, extra costs etc. Keeping it all local saves a lot of issues in the early days. In the future, online connectivity would be nice

... it’s not useable as cash. I can’t buy things with it as fees are a farce, and times are too slow. I have a Nano S with coins on it that I can do nothing with apart from “store value”... So what would you call it?
@_date: 2018-01-31 09:52:51
I should of elaborated, but yes, this is what I'm not sure of. If they just replace 'print' with 'mine' then its back to square one. Moving to a crypto that has found its value, litecoin for example, will take the power out of the "leaders" hands, which is probably the way to go. Time will tell, but I just hope it works!
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:16:57
Lacking any real thought, imo. I mean, they are using fiat lol.
Sure this can be done in a nice way. Probably a kickstarter candidate. Get a prototype made up with paper and pen. Then advance it if the idea works. Make a Kickstarter, and try to get it built! Board games do get funding, so it’s not a bad thing to try
@_date: 2018-01-06 21:00:20
I think it would make a good game. Might have some copyright issue though?
Also, I think it should have a wallet app for the players phones too, could be fun! I don’t mind helping with that. Will be nice to design something game based, current I’m making designs based around data entry ����

@_date: 2018-01-06 22:44:05
Shouldn’t be overly complicated tbh. I could probably design it over a weekend/a few evenings.
Building it might take longer. As you will need to build iOS and Android versions... but all you would want to do is create a temp database on 1 phone, and all other phones ping that with transactions. QR codes to scan and send etc, wallet totals and fees taken. Will be fun. iOS and android developers could knock it out in a few days.
@_date: 2018-01-06 23:21:06

It is favouritism, 100%. They are nursing it and doing all they can to keep that price high. I would not be shocked if for a day or two nothing but buy orders are processed, and a “bug” appeared for sells!
I have no ill will against alt coins, not even this one, but after this clear manipulation to try and favour bcash, I hope it crashes and burns! They have single handily set crypto back years in the main stream and in traditional finance sectors in the space of a week!
@_date: 2017-12-01 08:51:25
You can enter the rabbit hole here...
Also, if you are looking to start day trading, bitcoin is probably not the market to start out on. It’s way to wild at the moment, imo. Try learning on forex or metals first

Give it up... no one is sending a sob story money
@_date: 2017-12-12 21:38:36
All it will do is get bitcoin more prevalence. Which is good. I have already notice people talking about bitcoin and it’s only Tuesday night!
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:46:10
I use coinbase to get my bitcoin, they show litecoin as you go through the journey. I took a read up on it, and it seems like the day to day coin we need in society. People are saying it’s the silver to the gold of bitcoin, which really makes sense. So I figured, get a few, worth a gamble. I only have a small amount right now, but I’d like 10-20 in January if I can afford it.
Really, it *should* rocket up once bitcoin is looked upon as gold by the masses, and litecoin is for coffee... time will tell. You might as well get a few, dump them in a phone wallet, see what happens in a year
@_date: 2017-12-21 11:58:26
At the moment. In the future (we hope) that you would buy products and services with crypto and be paid in crypto. Zero need for fiat.
Personally i think banks will just turn into mining centres and then loan people crypto with interest.
“They” have to keep us in some form of debt for society to continue its path of slavery 
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:23:23
�� this feels stupid, and probably obvious, but I’ll ask it anyway; why was this not thought about during creation?? If bitcoin is to replace fiat then surely the system should have block sizes and structures to allow millions/hundreds of millions of transactions a day all over the world, at speed and at a penny a time? It should also be affordable to run on a small scale, not at Chinese industrial level
@_date: 2017-12-01 10:17:20
So, people borrowing fiat to buy crypto, in the hope they can covert that back into fiat, and still make a profit after interest and fees?!?! Nothing can possibly go wrong! Good grief ��
@_date: 2017-12-21 19:23:12
Eh. If your in a panic, just sell it. Bitcoin is a bumpy investment, only put in what you don’t care about.
Personally, I’m just going to hold it until one of two things happen; it becomes usable as cash and I can spend it. Or it hits a level where I can cash out £100,000+, what ever comes first
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:49:41
They bundled some litecoin with my order. And I even got free shipping, just had to pay a separate handling fee. Worth it though, as i find it hard to walk, so having some lite-weight coins in my pockets will be great!
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:39:10
Currently bitcoin is for holding large sums of money and holding it, like gold. I cannot see it being used as a currency in its current state. Like you, I feel the fees are a farce.
@_date: 2017-12-23 09:45:38
Didn’t know this. Thanks. Some people have sent traction’s out and they will never be processed ?? Seems like a terrible system, miners shouldn’t be able to pick and choose what transactions they process, should just be first come first serve, else your being held hostage to what ever fee they decide. Has to be bad in the future ??

Serious question, as I’m in UK; how is this going to work? Wouldn’t Netflix, for example, be pissed off if an ISP held its service hostage for more money? The ISP wouldn’t have to pay Netflix anything either. Netflix could loose millions of people overnight

So bitcoin will be obsolete �� I’d hope not
@_date: 2017-12-08 16:02:50
It’s an interesting conversation to be had though, thinking about it. What if I never convert back to fiat? What would happen if I started accepting bitcoin as payment, and only used bitcoin to transact... the UK government would have to tax me in bitcoin. If they want to exchange it to fiat after, then they can, but they can’t get me to exchange it.
Look at it this way, say a social construct was formed over something else, say grains of rice. I’m paid I’m rice, I buy things with rice. Wouldn’t I have to be taxed in rice? They cannot force you to work for fiat, you can work for what ever you want.
Funny you would make this OP, as it was a shower thought today.lol
I’m sure governments will enable crypto tax payments as soon as they notice shops and services accepting it as main stream payments... but we are going to have a big gray area for a good year when they sort that out, lots of tax free earnings will be made all over the globe
@_date: 2017-12-02 14:11:29
Think they are capping it at 20%+- . They feel this will cap people’s losses and profits and stabilise things.
Personally, I feel that once the bankers get involved, it will ruin all these “bitcoin day traders”, and that *will* stabilise it. Thousands of people setting sell orders when the price drops a few points as they are panicking about loosing £50. It just triggers a huge sell off, then a few hours of up and down as people try to “buy the dip”. Once the bankers get in and their computer algo’s suck up all the small fry, it will balance, and then go up at a steady pace year on year. IMO.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:53:10
No, they tax the profits on the oil... but you cannot walk into a shop and use oil to buy things... that’s the difference.
I’ll read that, see how it relates to HMRC and other places in the world. Thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:40:37
I’m not telling people to not pay tax, I’m asking how is it going to be done.
@_date: 2017-12-09 14:23:27
I say “point zero, zero, zero, two, five” etc. When explaining it to people for the first time. Also tell them about the 21 million coins etc.
I do 100% agree that a term for “penny” needs to be found, so that normal people can understand. And it needs to be in easy to read formats. Thinking of price tags in supermarkets. “0.00000025btc” for an Apple, is just hard to map out in your brain. I’m not sure on the answer. Perhaps it just has to be taken as it is, and we all need to learn the new format.

@_date: 2017-12-05 09:18:10
People need to have trust in bitcoin. The general public is still not aware of what it is or does or how it works. Yet if they see bitcoin on the list of payment options on PayPal, right along side visa and MasterCard etc, it gives it “credibility”, and more eyes will be drawn to bitcoin.
Plus, millions of sites use paypal as a service. This would instantly put bitcoin in the general public. It would also be handy for the website owners, as they could receive fiat, if they wish, as PayPal can do the conversion. Or just receive the bitcoin.

Sort of good, I guess. It’s so businesses can accept litecoin, for example, but take payments in bitcoin, dash etc. Saves the customer the exchange part... I wonder how much they wet their beak though ��
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:29:15
Yeah I found that it’s a cash market strange... the reason other markets work is something changes hands at some point. If the bitcoin is never actually bought and sold, only betting on its price, it’s not actually going to effect the real bitcoin price. If anything, it will just get more people to buy bitcoins directly.

Use a paper wallet until you can afford a ledger wallet. If it’s only a few hundred worth then store on your phone for now.
Under no circumstances should you be storing crypto on a pornware infested laptop, that also happens to be running windows!! You might as well post your private keys on 4chan and be done with it 
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:10:34
I was thinking this. Unless they tax you in bitcoin, it seems like a busted system. If you get paid in bitcoin, and spend bitcoin, surly they would need to tax you bitcoin? If we all agreed to use rice as payment, and got paid in rice and bought things with rice, wouldn’t we have to be taxed in rice... if HMRC, or IRS, want to convert it to fiat after then they can.
A mismatch in value is bound to happen. Look at this year for example, you could of spent 1btc in January, and it’s worth £xx.xx and now it’s worth £xxxx.xx in fiat, what they going to tax you? They have to tax you a percentage set in bitcoin, so it’s all relative. If we start using crypto as currency and not gold, it’s going to fuck governments up
@_date: 2017-12-24 14:07:16
Try these, should do the trick it’s what I use... US versions should exist 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:57:29
Umm. Well first off, you shouldn’t really dump all of your savings into one basket...
Anyway. I have read that the market will be capped to 20%+-, so it will stop being so wild. I’m not 100% sure on all the details. With bitcoin being open to the markets, the price will sky rocket, as the supply is limited. But, another point to note; it’s going to be leveraged and sold in small bits. Much like Forex, you don’t buy an entire GBP, you buy and trade the ‘pips’ basically. So even if you read that “bitcoin has plummeted X points”, your coins value will not be that drastically reduced.
It’s hard to explain, and as I say, I’m not 100% on it all, but if you are that worried, sell it all off now. I only have 0.25 coin, so I’m just holding with zero fear of it dropping.
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:21:35
Yeah I picked up a few litecoins, it’s made me nearly £200 this week or so... it’s doing well, but always feels so small compared to bitcoin lol. It’s probably going to make me more money over the next few years than bitcoin as I’m late to the party, but just lacks the excitement of big numbers �� ask this time next year, see if we are more crazy once it’s at 10k a coin
@_date: 2017-12-10 09:29:19
I’m not up on ETH. The reason I avoided it was due to the hack it had during the year. Again, only a hunch, but I can’t see big business taking a coin seriously if it’s been hacked.
I look at things how major players might see them, not as I wish them to be... of that makes sense? Lol
@_date: 2017-12-21 17:24:59

@_date: 2017-12-18 18:51:15
That’s a lot of calculations to be made, on every single transaction by millions of people. How are they going to police that? Even more so when people will spin up new wallets in minutes with no ID.
Let’s say, once the fees are fixed;
I buy coffee, btc into owners wallet, he directly buys beans from venezuela in btc, he farmer does god knows what with it at his end. All staff, equipment, transport etc paid for, everything done in btc. The transaction lists will be huge, with lots to work out...
I can see this is where the banks get in. They hold the btc account like they do our current accounts, then they do all the calculations for you on a transaction to transaction level, keep record, and then inform HMRC/IRS, and then they give you a bill. Will be years away, but they will have to do something like that really

Bitcoin has to reach a million at least if it’s to become a gold standard. Just way too many people on earth to share 21 million coins, and 21 million is years and years away. By the same train of thought, litecoin will also need to sky rocket, but as it’s the day to day coin, it has to fully replace fiat, so that’s going to be a long process. I’m guessing it will take 10 years to get into 100k+
Again, all my personal thoughts on the subject, I could be way off
@_date: 2017-12-07 11:12:25
No problem.
I would stay clear of the finance sector all together, it’s rule and regs everywhere. You would be better to have a business that, for example, sells equipment related to bitcoin. Then mine and trade coin on the side...
Your main issue is once they find out your basically day trading through the business. They will then apply different rules to your tax. But then again, you will also be able to declare losses on your tax return through trading, so could balance out. Best ask an accountant on the rules for that.
Also be very careful you are not seen as an investment business. So do not trade for other people, at all. This will bring banking codes into it all... again, not what you want to mess with
@_date: 2017-12-02 16:15:34
I think what OP is getting at is they want “normal” price tags. So 0.0000183btc is a huge visual difference from £5.99 (not real conversion). So when we go into a shop we can see an item priced up as 1.2btc. Makes it easier to visualise costs and change given if it’s put into blocks off 100... well, I think that’s what they are trying to say lol
@_date: 2017-12-10 12:11:46
@_date: 2017-12-12 22:16:24
I would assume the price would hit 0 quicker than 100% of owners can cash out. At that point, your just giving it away, no fiat needed? 
@_date: 2017-12-17 21:52:05
No idea. I see it as nothing but an investment account. Litecoin was looking good for day to day spending, but people are just jumping into it and holding that too, so I’m guessing fees will fuck that one up soon.
For crypto to take out fiat, we need to spend it

Trade as a limited company. Employ yourself. So you will own a company with with one employe that’s also you. Pay your self minimum wage, then take directors dividends. Then pay corporation tax on the profits left over after all your deductions. Put all mining and computing equipment through the business. Set office up in your house, claim part of your mortgage as rent. The list goes on for stuff to claim back.

@_date: 2017-12-05 10:08:55
Thats my plan, real estate. Fiat money is a joke, and pumping bitcoin profits into anything that connects to fiat is not something I want to be apart of. I want to sell my bits directly for a property or properties if it hits silly value lol. In this world, the only truly valuable thing you can have is a roof over your head. Shelter for you and your family will *always* have a value, no matter what. Recession or boom. Fiat or crypto. War or peace time. Shelter for you and loved ones will always come first, and therefore will always be the most truly valuable thing you can possess

I think I see what you are trying to say, but fiat has no value what so ever. It’s just the current system in play. Bitcoins value is shown in fiat to give people an idea of what its “worth”. So you know that you can swap 1 bitcoin for 11k in fiat which we know can be exchanged for, say, second hand car. You could also go directly to the dealer and give him 1 bitcoin, removing fiat out the equation completely. Perhaps the dealer values bitcoin more than you, and says he wants 0.9 bitcoins, as that’s his price...
The bitcoin is not worth anything, fiat is not worth anything, it’s value is based on what we determine it is. You could use rocks as currency as long as everyone else agrees to its value. Which was effectively the silver and gold systems of old.

Serious question. How difficult/pricey is it to just set up a processing rig? No mining, just processing?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:10:19
So your hostage to the miners then. If they want £100 a transaction, then you have to pay it or never have it transferred ?
@_date: 2017-12-26 12:42:08
Ah yeah okay, abbreviation threw me off. Thanks anyways lol
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:45:36
Why are you freaking out??
@_date: 2017-12-06 08:32:27
Cool. I can see these becoming very popular. Thanks for the info
@_date: 2017-12-01 09:47:30
And so it begins ...
@_date: 2017-12-15 10:22:06
Interesting, I’ll take a look. Sounds scummy as fuck
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:22:20
Only sell half, as it’s probably going to go up more into next year
@_date: 2017-12-09 17:37:12
�� dip.
Take a quick look at all the other non-crypto markets. Look at daily, weekly, monthly and yearly. Then compare to bitcoin. It’s just normal up and down of a market, just bigger numbers, moving faster.
Play around with this;
Apple are making money hand over fist, yet you wouldn’t even bat an eyelid when they have a “dip”.
If you have so much money invested your panicking over it, then you have put too much in. If it’s not everything you have, and your still panicking, then any kind of self investment is not for you. Probably better off giving the money to a business and let them gamble it into “low risk” hedge funds. A reason so many people loose money in self investment is down to emotion. Panic buying and selling.
@_date: 2017-12-18 18:30:22
As I say. At what point is the thing you are earning classed as money? Until crypto is classed as cash, how are they going to tax it? I could of been earning 10 BTC a day last year, spending them and paying bills. Not once trading them back for fiat. What do they tax me? Say I accepted an alt that’s not even on the radar, how do they tax it? If two people agree to trade, it’s valuable. The rice argument is silly, but it holds true. People can exchange what ever they like.
The currency market is stable. If I do a bit of work for 200,000¥, when they pay me, it will be converted as it’s routed to my account. Easy to calculate tax, and then I pay the tax. If I have no intention of converting crypto to fiat, they will have to bill me in crypto, and bill me in the type of crypto I use. In the UK they will tax me the minute I cash out of crypto, until I do, they can’t do anything, currently. Could be different in the US.
Once it’s so widely used the governments will have no choice but to bill people in crypto at the percentage they require.

It’s it’s only use at the moment. Can’t spend it like cash, that’s for sure
@_date: 2017-12-18 16:02:10
Na, people just want to be rich and are taking the gamble on litecoin... “I missed the bitcoin millions, so I’ll buy 5k worth of litecoin and hope it rockets like bitcoin”... is basically the reason people are using litecoin 
@_date: 2017-12-05 10:12:02
Why use a throwaway to make OP then answer questions with your real account?? ��
@_date: 2017-12-04 21:10:08
Oh so the email is just something for a placebo then?
@_date: 2017-12-09 20:55:40
Have a quick read below. Basically I’m betting on litecoin becoming the new cash, with Bitcoin to become more of a trading coin.
I could be wrong, but the setups feel like that’s what is going to happen. No harm, if I loose a few hundred pound, so be it.
@_date: 2017-12-05 21:53:12
Is this the same as my question the other day?? 
I’m still confused, as unspent seems like it’s just waiting for me to finish the transfer. My hardware shows the amount I want, but the transaction still shows unspent money
@_date: 2017-12-11 10:01:48
Novelty and fun
@_date: 2017-12-05 09:00:30
Add PayPal to that, and bitcoin sky rockets
@_date: 2017-12-23 12:16:23
Thanks I’ll save that for later
@_date: 2017-12-15 18:28:09
Correct. That’s what I think
@_date: 2017-12-05 22:11:38
Okay, so is it the fee or something maybe? As I transferred 100% from coinbase to my hardware ��
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:30:37
It’s fishy as hell. In the UK it’s off the table completely until January now.
I think they are panicking about mass sell off, as millions of people have the cashcoin for “free”, so the second they have the chance they will sell. That would push millions of £€$¥ out the market in minutes. Let it happen I say. The market will determine bcash’ value. If each coin ends up being worth £0.01 then so be it.
@_date: 2017-12-23 18:53:29
I know this is not much help, but tell them it’s none of their business, and your not going to dish out private information about your bitcoins. If it’s a problem, you will go to a new bank.
Asking where money comes from is way out of a banks remit, unless you are applying to borrow money, that is?
@_date: 2017-12-23 10:34:39
How much would it cost to run a node, process transactions on AWS? Might be good to spin up an instance and process nothing but low fee transactions. Just enough to make even on the cost of the AWS setup, like a non-profit node. If that’s even possible, I’d do it.
Bitcoin is more than a quick buck. I wish everyone would just work on killing fiat and not trying to earn fiat from bitcoin ��
@_date: 2019-08-13 11:23:14
1,700BTC famous?
@_date: 2019-10-11 12:28:22
They want cash so they don't have to pay the tax. Best way to have 'cash flow'.
They would use bitcoin instantly, as long as the taxman couldn't find out the amount they have taken
@_date: 2019-06-22 00:48:45
Probably due to your attitude more than anything
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:42:01
I think it will, just that most of us won’t be here to see it. Only 21million coins will be made, they have to push the value up if they are used like gold is today
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:24:36
Once it goes into the futures market at the end of the year/start of next, you can sort of short it... if that’s what you mean.
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:34:47

Wonder how much he earns a month... must be a day trader. 85k is not pocket change to the majority. 10k and below is ‘blow off, be annoyed and move on’. 85k is big money imo, if your not a day trader, and a good one at that.

I’m a late comer, so only 0.2btc here. Chances are, I’ll forget all about it. Come back in 10 years and cash out to get £10,000 or something. Doubt it will be a life changing sum of money. Bought them as I’m sure I’ll get some return, just not a big one

That I’m not sure of tbh. Good point 
@_date: 2017-11-03 09:35:31
I’m just under £600, started with £500 Tuesday night. Also had to pay Coinbase fees etc. I’d just buy a few hundred worth and see what happens. I’m aiming for around 2k-5k worth, but doing it bit by bit. £500 going in next week

It’s just not wide spread enough to take off, yet. The day you can pay with bit coin in every store, like you can MasterCard or visa, that’s the day you will feel safe. Until then, it’s just a stock, and like any other stock, it *will* go up and down. 
@_date: 2017-11-17 09:45:47
You did, but what he’s saying is that millions of people are just putting money in, then taking it out at the next price jump. Some people have no interest in long term, just a quick profit 
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:44:54
Would it only be profits once you convert it back to fiat? Can’t really tax you on a profit that could evaporate next week, surly?
@_date: 2017-11-06 20:03:53

Apple have humans and scripts to verify the apps. One of the reasons it takes so long to be approved. It’s a good process, I’ve submitted a few times and as its a humans you can talk over your app, send them videos and credentials etc for testing.
If you put a clone app up, such as this, it *should* get picked up and rejected. But never say never, I guess.
@_date: 2017-11-07 12:05:44
Thanks. Seems like it will hold my hand then, which is good. I’m just unboxing all this now, going to transfer everything from Coinbase and bread to the ledger. I’m hoping this will be a simple “send” command ! Any pitfalls I should be aware of before I start?
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:08:59
Fair enough. No need to worry about it until you need to
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:26:30
Really?? That’s robbery !!! And this app has not been pulled yet?!?!
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:43:49
All of us new guys are getting ripped off, as we pick the simple and easy methods of getting bitcoins. Don’t worry about it, if your going to keep buying more and more, then worry about the fee. You will probably just keep this for 5 years and that £6 will be irrelevant 
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:21:03
Dump all of it into a hardware wallet. At least you know you won’t loose it
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:18:57
What’s wrong with the wallet? Loosing funds or something?
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:58:14
Interesting. Thanks. I’m new to all this really, so all seems a little wild
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:21:47
I’m only on 0.2btc. I really can’t see it turning into £100,000+ anytime soon, as 1btc would be worth millions! The uptake is just not fast enough, and the usage is too small for it to explode like us late comers are hoping. The millions will be made by the guys who have 20+btc that they got years back.
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:35:07
I think I’ll put it all in Trezor. I’m getting a new phone next week, so I’d like to have zero balance in this wallet before erasing the phone.

They are trying to charge me £17 fees for £457 worth of coin?!? Anywhere else cheaper. Iv used them before and the fee was £5 or something. This is stupidly high,imo
@_date: 2017-11-21 08:29:45
From what I can gather, it’s now pointless for us at home to mine bitcoin. I’ve wanted to mine for ages, put power costs in the UK are a joke

I set up bread last night on iOS. Seems fine to me
@_date: 2017-11-27 14:15:15
Ive been waiting for a dip to buy more... still waiting. I’m just going to buy it. The dip might gain you £10-£20 more coin at most... is it worth waiting for. The dip could come after even more growth, so you will be no better off anyway
@_date: 2017-11-06 19:06:24
Personally, I think my £1000 will turn into £2000 tops. Some seem to think it will rocket to make us all millionaires, or at least up in the hundred thousands. I can’t see it
@_date: 2017-11-14 11:23:21
That’s a lot of growth! I hope you are right, time will tell. A lot will need to happen for those figures though. We will need it to be more mainstream. I’d like to see people spending bitcoin more too. That will help the value massively. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 17:11:16
Apart from “Keep your money off an exchange”, it’s all the same points anyone would give on stock/trading
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:14:42
The more I read, around the bitcoin subject, as I’m new, the more I feel it’s going to sky rocket. But then, after 5-10 years, it’s going to level off and perform like sort of gold standard... I think that each country will create its own crypto, the IMF will get involved, and Bitcoin will be left as the backing currency, much like fiat was mainly backed by gold... Well that’s my hunch anyway lol
@_date: 2017-11-01 14:07:22
Yeah, I think getting a few hundred each time it drops could be a good idea. I don’t want to dump tens of thousands into it, I think I’ll stop once I get to £2-5k. See where I land in 5 years time with it
@_date: 2017-11-05 17:21:22
General feeling towards 2X is that if you are given them, keep them for a little bit then dump for bitcoin. Or just straight off dump them for bit coin...
Personally, I want central banking to die a very quick death, so I want bitcoin to take over and take real ground. I’m dumping my “free” 2X after a week for bitcoin. I think the initial price will bubble up, then we will all kill it !
@_date: 2017-11-28 08:28:54
?? What country is this
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:35:20
Ahhh naughty, so people assume they are getting bitcoin, but end up with bitcoin cash
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:29:01
Serious question, as I’m new; why can’t two exist? We have lots of fiat variants, why not lots of cryptos? Really we should only have 3 or 4 for now, to help adoption, but once we get to coffee buying, surely it’s going to be a free for all? I’m even going to guess that all the central banks will also get in on this at some point. “Great British Bit” etc
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:32:29
At this point definitely, but it needs to level out at some point to be fully usable

Just had this email from coinbase. Nothing huge, but interesting that they are still planning for a fork. Some useful times for people in that mail too, so thought I’d post it
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:52:33
I see... Is that the “lightening” changes that are in the process of being built?
@_date: 2017-11-06 18:04:01

@_date: 2017-11-23 17:06:42
I like to see this!! People using bitcoin day to day will push it mainstream 
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:09:10
But what is tether?? How do you get bitcoins for a magical currency? What’s behind tether?
@_date: 2017-11-01 12:08:25
I have now spent £500, purchased today and last night... even with the fees and the transfer costs to my wallet, I’m now at £514.07 . I used coin base, so can only do £500 a week it says... I probably won’t get more until my hardware arrives anyway.
How much have you bought? As £14 in less than a day strikes me as a lot... so I’m interested in others returns.
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:06:50
As they are creating their own crypto
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:36:25
Yeah all sorted now, just a busy night I guess. That’s a good thing lol
Thanks 
@_date: 2017-11-27 09:13:48
... did you buy lots of coin  Else how is this possible 
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:53:10
At the moment... in the near future, once speed and fees get more favourable, it might change. Time will tell I guess 
@_date: 2017-11-13 12:02:20
I think bitcoin investments are for the long game. Seems to be something you need to set and forget really. If your looking at the price and it worrying you, your day to day is going to suck lol
@_date: 2017-11-16 10:34:10
Once you buy, you can send the coins to your hardware, can you not?
@_date: 2017-11-15 14:45:32
Give it a rest
@_date: 2017-11-27 21:02:48
�� but I sent some to my hardware, and received them all, well, I think I have. My wallet matches the coinbase BTC sent. Then I check the transactions and the transaction is split... so do I not have all the coins?
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:40:26
As the email says , you will get both. Not sure what B2X is going to give you, but at least you have some I guess lol
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:46:20
Might even buy a couple of those too lol. If nothing else, once the price jumps up I can use it on the website for a little more discount 
@_date: 2019-06-16 08:19:24
If bitcoin was the only currency in the world, what would the numbers look like when you turn *all* the other machines involved with fiat (from ATM’s, to all the equipment in every bank, to all the card readers, card production, transport that moves paper fiat, etc etc)? It will probably balance out overall
@_date: 2017-11-15 18:15:52
I really want more day to day use on bitcoin, I feel it could hold it back!
I’m new to all this too. It’s definitely a job of some sort lol
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:44:19
Buy Ledger or Trezor hardware wallet and take it with you. Then you can load it up and trade again
@_date: 2017-11-09 13:20:50
So increasing blocksize is not needed then? What else can they do?
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:32:03
Cool. Okay, well at least it will happen, even if it will take a while
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:34:43
Yeah true. I just can’t see “them” letting “us” trade and do commerce without wetting their beak... they will want it to be regulated through them at all stages. Mainly for profits, tax, but also to track crime etc. People sending currency around the world freely is outrageous, for them!!
@_date: 2017-11-23 19:36:54
Would the fees drop if more people used bitcoin? Profit with small fees at a larger volume?
@_date: 2017-11-13 15:22:05
Umm. Seems like it could go on for ever. Perhaps I just drop a little off current price. Thanks, at least I know I’m doing it correctly!
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:25:53
Think it was a joke mate lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 16:19:46
Easy. Click send from coinbase app, scan ledger wallet QR code from chrome app, wait.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:45:40
Having it mineable by more people is nice... apart from that, it’s just another coin
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:42:13
I’ve done some some forex trading, but it’s small movements. So my tiny £500 pot wouldn’t jump up and down many times at £20-£70 jumps over the course of 3 days... it’s great for now, but to be taken seriously and to be adopted, it needs to be steady, imo.
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:37:05
Let’s hope the rate of adoption is fast then
@_date: 2017-11-09 08:23:56
So after reading this, the upgrade *has* to happen. The size needs to increase... surly the answer is to just increase bitcoin, and not fork off a new coin??? Is it not that simple?
@_date: 2017-11-15 17:10:27
How will they get lower? More miners?
@_date: 2017-11-01 11:55:01
You hoping for half a mil? Lol. How many years will that take, so you think ?
@_date: 2017-11-01 07:38:33

All good now though!  Coins are in
@_date: 2017-11-21 15:33:38

@_date: 2017-11-07 13:18:39
I have just (30mins ago) sent everything from bread and Coinbase to my new Ledger hardware. Both Bread and Coinbase are now at £0.00. So I should be fine now until all this forking stuff is over? I was going to keep some in Coinbase to get the 2X copies, but sounded like a lot of messing around
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:20:02
What are the risks of leaving it in during the fork?
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:40:20
Seems like the thing to do. Time will tell.
Btw, What’s the point in giving everyone B2X anyway? Won’t it’s value just plummet to £0?
@_date: 2017-11-04 23:20:16
Nice!! Good use of it
@_date: 2017-11-04 17:11:30
How many coins? Like a little jackpot being from that long ago!
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:13:13
BALLS OF STEEL
@_date: 2017-11-08 10:52:07
Would that mean the bitcoins I put into my hardware yesterday will still be available on the other fork next week? Or did I pull them too early?
If that’s the case, I would need to pull them off the new fork and store those in hardware too??
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:28:04
Why are these forks being made? Cash grabs?
@_date: 2017-11-15 13:05:41
Do you have an article that accurately explains the difference? As I’m interested 
@_date: 2017-11-16 14:15:40
Anything under £1000. Once you get into 4 figures, put it on hardware. No harm. Digital wallet is for your spending money, really.
@_date: 2017-11-16 09:00:09
I would mine, but I’m from the UK so electricity is outrageously expensive... it’s a shame
@_date: 2017-11-07 15:01:31
... don’t get a lone to ‘bet’ with. It’s madness. Just get what you can afford together, and use that.
Also, sounds like your not flush with cash, so only spend what you can afford to give away.
Like you, I missed the boat all those years ago. At this point, the chances are the €1000 will only go up to €1500 in a year. We won’t be making millions like those who got in years ago and own hundreds of coins. The interest you pay on the €1000 loan will also eat out of that profit, to the point you have to ask yourself, is it worth the risk for €100???

I do not know enough about the problem to suggest a solution. I thought the lightening code might give us some relief.
As more people come on board, perhaps more focus will be given to scale
@_date: 2017-11-02 19:03:11
Fair enough. I think I’ll be doing something similar tbh. B2X should be comparable with existing BTC hardware then?
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:33:52
Can you still use bitcoin on it? 
@_date: 2017-11-15 21:45:42
What is it, to start with?!?
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:17:08
Surly you can drive to an ally, hand over some notes and get your drugs with out the hassle of crypto?!?
@_date: 2017-11-23 23:10:27
Thought it was coming in the first half of next year... I’ll see if I have the article saved. Might of just been a projected release
@_date: 2017-11-15 08:38:49
Good read. Made this issue easier to understand. The want to make crypto payments as easy as using a Visa card is great. But everything else about the Bcash just seems like a cash grab, with no real honest intentions. Shame.
On the flip side. What needs to happen for bitcoin to be used like an everyday bank card? Anyone have an answer for that? Any business available to make this happen?
@_date: 2017-11-07 18:18:38
I’m worried that the UK and US will make crypto illegal... I just can’t see them allowing us to avoid the stupid fiat money system
@_date: 2017-11-04 20:33:52
At the moment I’d love it to go up times a million, but I’m wondering at what point we will see it be level and then become useful in day to day life
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:34:37
Put in as much as you are okay with loosing. Put it in hardware. Forget about it. Come back in a few years, and see what happened! Trying to keep up with all this up and down will cause you nothing but concern 
@_date: 2017-11-07 19:09:20
Yeah maybe. We will see.
My wish is for fiat to be removed entirely, and bitcoin to replace it.
@_date: 2017-11-07 13:06:28
All done now. Double checked the ID’s. I used QR codes so couldn’t go wrong really. Now I wait for it to dip to buy some more, then wait I guess lol
@_date: 2017-11-11 13:42:52
Is it US only? Looking to buy some more bitcoin next week, or when it drops a little more. Coinbase rate is stupid
@_date: 2017-11-07 11:43:04
I have a ledger coming in the next few hours, how is it better? 
Tbh, this is all more hassle than it’s worth. I would of just bought bitcoin after the fork if I known all this
Edit: Ledger Nano S just arrived. So will sort my wallet out very soon
@_date: 2017-11-02 18:31:12
Okay. I have £500 in Bread, so I was going to do another £500 in Coinbase just to get the B2X. Then move all £1000 into some hardware, when it gets here. Just starting out, literally a few nights ago, so it’s all low amounts at the moment until I’m sure I know what I’m doing.
@_date: 2017-11-14 10:12:45
Realistically, how much could us late comers make? Been thinking about it this week. I only have £1000 worth, can’t see that reaching £100,000, but what’s realistic? £2000-£4000 in many years time?
@_date: 2017-11-15 19:08:02
Once you transfer them to your ledger wallet, for example, are all ties cut with the place you bought them? Got mine from coinbase, and sent them to my ledger. I’m assuming they are now in my total control, is that correct? The transactions being public record is confusing me tbh... 
@_date: 2017-11-21 14:28:43
Buy any amount you can. You don’t need thousands to invest. 
@_date: 2017-11-23 16:59:16
Oh okay. Makes sense else people couldn’t send you coin easily.
Yeah I’m using it for holding. Might add a little more cash to it soon though. Waiting for a decent dip. I want 0.25 coin, I have 0.19 at the moment. Then I can just forget about it, and hopefully sell once I have made a good profit.
@_date: 2017-11-15 10:46:12
With people trading in contracts, will they also slip into buying actual bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-03-22 19:25:14
WE KNOW!
@_date: 2018-02-08 08:45:57
How are you getting on paying every single thing in your existence with crypto? As I know my bank won’t accept it for my mortgage payments, supermarkets wont take it for food, Esso won’t give me petrol, the list goes on. 
It’s all very well and good throwing around the “we don’t need banks or fiat” shouts all the time, but currently, in the real world you have to use fiat for basically everything.
@_date: 2018-02-02 14:37:09
... You would of made back your crypto losses? ����
@_date: 2018-02-01 16:32:57
Until we can spend crypto on everyday items, you need to expect shit like this at every turn
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:19:53
Millennials are broke, and crypto is a 'quick buck', which they need so they can buy houses and such.... not really surprising
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:27:13
Man, Iv got lots to learn!!! Thanks 
@_date: 2018-02-12 12:11:33
if you wait long enough, they will all be correct
@_date: 2017-10-31 23:23:39
It has a little green tick, but under the amount it has the progress indicator which has not moved...
Maybe it’s just taking a while as the system is busy? It’s my first go, so I’m expecting it to work like a bank transfer, so all in at once, but I’m guessing it’s bit by bit.
Thanks for the hardware info. Makes it easier in future then!
@_date: 2019-09-21 22:42:26
After today’s pounding this is fitting
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:36:29
I found this; Coinbase - Buy Bitcoin &amp; more by Coinbase, Inc.  android might have one... 
I’m looking to buy, might try this
@_date: 2019-09-14 21:49:17
You are not allowed to use that currency!
Lots of love.
Land of the free ����
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:20:24
Hey. What app is that your using to buy? I’m looking to buy some, not sure where to get them or store them. Every site looks ‘scammy’
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:01:38
How much was the fee ? Serious question
@_date: 2018-04-23 18:40:50
Anyone recommend a system I can program that’s free? Like MT4 but geared towards crypto
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:14:43
I would of thought each legit dev would buy all the main domains as soon as the project went live. Average people will be scammed by this! Filthy
@_date: 2018-04-30 13:36:41
7 cents is not bad. I’m looking to add crypto payments to a gym, but fees killed the idea last year
@_date: 2018-04-05 17:33:05
Fair enough 
@_date: 2018-04-24 06:57:58
Thanks I’ll take a look later today
@_date: 2019-05-11 16:14:33
People want to get rich, Fiat rich, quick. If bitcoin makes a constant climb so people think they can gain a few hundred percent in a month, then it will explode again. If not, it’s just going to bounce up and down I’m small amounts forever, like the majority of stock
@_date: 2019-05-30 12:12:37
Of course!!!
@_date: 2019-05-02 09:38:26
Usually it’s done with USD, is this progress?
