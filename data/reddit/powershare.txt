Hmmm interesting, if we compare it to fiat, FIAT has a big value because governments guarantee you can pay taxes with that, that is a demand driver for the fiat. IF bitcoin can be that then HELLO adoption, price movement doesn't matter in this case because you can always have spot price. correct me if i am wrong.

A very good read! Very informative! I can't believe I've never read this before. It's straight to point, it's interesting and it's informative, what more can we ask for? It illustrates how important Bitcoin can become. I would recommend this to anyone who wants to get to know the industry.

Well, if you think such news no longer have big impact on prices. A few years ago it would make the price raze up immediately. None the less it's still great news. I only with other countries would see this as well.
