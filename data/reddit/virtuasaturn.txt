One useful action would be the repeal of the 16th amendment, the abolition of the IRS, and its agents returning to private life so that both currency and property can be exchanged freely without the need to track every single exchange between every human being.

Meh, I know it's not probably not happening anytime soon, I just like to jump on the sky-high idealism on this sub. It's, at minimum, more fun than being realistic and serious n' shit. 
Edit: in the words of The Simpsons' Nelson Muntz, "I prefer illusion to despair."

Right on comrade! Welcome to the SRS and anti-libertarian masses of the reddit "fempire!" In the name of love, equality, and fairness, we must kill all rich people! /s

The actual crime is *state theft of earned money* through confiscatory taxation and regulatory schema. When you say "damage done to somebody," I hope you mean done to whomever earned the money by the state..

Does anyone else feel afraid to express their opinion here? I feel like if I say what I really think about "our" government then the jackboots will be at my door in no time..

It's extremely sad. The supposed land of the free is no longer a safe place to express our political opinions..

FinCEN should be abolished.

This is concerning as fuck. If the state co-opts bitcoin, it loses its power to be subversive and to create real liberty-oriented change.. All we want is to be left alone!

"With representation" is just an excuse for bureaucrats to hide behind the principle of majority rule as though it justifies the exploitation of individuals who do not want. My rights are not subject to majoritarian approval.

Positions and policy changes? How about: 
-give up the war on drugs and decriminalization schemes alike and outright legalize
-legalize currency competition
-end spying on financial transactions
-end income taxation
To name a few..
