Definitely not Bitcoin then. Paying a transaction fee and therefore being literally penalized each time I use it how I please sucks.

That's because you're not supposed to hold currency indefinitely. You're supposed to spend it to enrich your life and invest it to have more money to enrich your life later.

Put it in an index fund? Treasury bond if you're scared of your own shadow level of risk. Then again if you're interested in bitcoin, just doubt your risk averse.

BTC is a commodity. Y'all wouldn't want to HODL if it was an actual currency.

Why will it become a store of value? Why will it become a means of exchange? There's no evidence to suggest that. Volatility in price is high as ever and shows no evidence of changing which will scare most major business away from adoption preventing it from being a means of exchange.

Almost never as long term investment vehicles. Currency is used to purchase investments or loaned out but it is rarely used as the vehicle itself (focusing on retail investors here)

Define a currency and a commodity for me then analyze the traits of BTC. Let me know what conclusion you're forced to arrive at.
