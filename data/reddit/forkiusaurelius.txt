According to the article, Razormind have 260 staff across London, Belfast, Manchester and Vancouver.
The registered office however, appears to be someone's house. (
The company was incorporated on February 19th, 2016. CEO Jawad Yaqubs LinkedIn profile however says he worked there from 2009-2010.
The telephone number that Razormind give on their website appears to be associated with a potentially scammy site called wapbill.net (
The companies registered secretary is a man named Phil Sturgeon. His LinkedIn profile states that he worked for the company from September 2014 to August 2015 (remember the company wasn't incorporated until February 2016).
The pair of them are contacts with a man named Simon Callender on LinkedIn - who according to his profile is currently a project manager at "Razormind Networks Ltd", a company with 2 registered directors - Phil Sturgeon and Yaqub Jawab. This company was registered on April 22nd 2014, and dissolved on December 1st 2015. Their annual return is currently overdue. (
Phil Sturgeon had some nice things to say about Simon Callendar on LinkedIn, in relation to his position as a hotel night manager:

Look up **any** of those people, the things they have accomplished, their inventions, the awards they have received.
To be under the delusion that the current batch of core devs are the only people on the planet capable of working on bitcoin is frankly absurd. And more to the point, even if it were true, Bitcoin would have an astonishingly low bus factor.

Consider that the security of the blockchain, a product of miner activity, is central to giving the blockchain value to users. And value ascribed by users is what enables the miners to continue mining for profit.

Who said anything about bcash? Honestly it's difficult to talk to you because so much of the conversation only takes place in your head.
My original point, which I stand by, is that the Core developers are not unique snowflake unicorns who cannot possibly be replaced.

If they're unwilling to continue working on Bitcoin after November, they will be replaced by equally good developers who are willing.

Don't be confused by the name, HashCash was not a currency in any way. It was a method of eliminating spam emails.
[*"Hashcash is a proof-of-work system used to limit email spam and denial-of-service attacks"*](
It's very surprising that, after 38 comments, nobody else corrected you on this point.
Having said that, credit is absolutely due to Adam for his pioneering work. Bitcoin may not exist if it wasn't for his efforts. On the other hand, the claim that "Bitcoin is HashCash extended with inflation control" is outrageous, and I think does more to damage Adams reputation than to enhance it.

How do you define "super, super majority consensus"? Certainly something like 95% is actually really unfair. It basically gives the 5% veto power.
Say you had 100 people in a room. 94 of them were in agreement on something, but 6 assholes can spoil the day for 94 other people because they happen to disagree.
51% is the only fair threshold. It means 49% of people need to be prepared to swallow their pride and go with the majority. That's very tough.
We saw something similar in Britain recently, with 48% of people refusing to accept consensus. Would it have been better if the referendum required 60%? Then we would have had 52% of pissed off people instead of 48%.

BitFury accounts for less than 8% of the hash rate. You need at least 15% to even activate SegWit before it times out in November.
Even if you had 50%, your chain wouldn't activate SegWit for a month. At the moment you have 0.3%.

This trips many people up, especially people from certain European countries where the title 'engineer' is not protected.
In my country you do not have to be chartered to have the word 'engineer' in your job title (my job title is "Software Engineer"), but you do have to be chartered to call yourself an architect (even a software architect).
Not sure about the US, but in Europe there was a informal effort across the industry to use the term "Software Engineer" rather then "Computer Programmer", as the latter has some negetive, geeky, connotations and belies the professionalism of the craft.

* SegWit activation times out in November.
* The BIP148 chain will need to mine 2016 blocks in order to lock in SegWit before the time out.
* In order to mine 2016 blocks before SegWit times out, you need at least 15% of the current hash power
* You have 0.3%

Yeah that's one way of looking at it - a peer-to-peer way of making a payment.
Still, if we're talking precursors to Bitcoin, we have to be talking about b-money, not HashCash.

Because SegWit makes block size a much more loosely defined thing.

He obviously wasn't talking to you bro.

True and irrelevent.
With a handful of miners, it's going to take months or years for the BIP148 chain to reach the next difficulty adjustment. But you have a hard deadline in November, if you can't activate SegWit on your chain by then BIP148 is a complete and total failure.
In order to activate SegWit you need to mine 2016 blocks by November. In order to mine that many blocks at the currently difficulty, you need roughly 15% of the current network hash rate.
You have around 0.3%.

With no miners, you will not have a chain.

With no miners you have no chain.
With no chain you have no users.
With no users your coin has no value.

They released a feature which directly threatened miners income, which required the miners to approve it, and then they acted surprised when the miners didn't overwhelmingly support it.
They did this, despite the miners telling them in bright blinking neon letters exactly what it was they wanted over a year beforehand.
Pretty silly if you ask me.

SegWit only gets activated on the BIP148 chain once 2016 blocks have been mined. Have you run the numbers to see how long it would take to mine that many blocks with the tiny amount of hash rate you have dedicated to the BIP148 chain? hint: it's a lot longer than 1 months.
SegWit will not activate on the BIP148 chain in August, not unless you can get a significant amount of mining power behind you.

And what about the November deadline? If you can't mine 2016 blocks by November you won't get SegWit at all.

Blockchain.info [launched]( the [Thunder Network]( over a year ago.


Tell me more about how they're a "parisitic company who add no value" and how they "could have been a leader in layer 2 solutions".
You fucking idiot.

What's the reason for your certainty? Seems like a lot of BIP148 supporters are unable to distinguish between hope and reality.
@_date: 2017-06-10 06:50:29
So you haven't read the white paper?
Because if you haven't, your opinion is worth nothing.
