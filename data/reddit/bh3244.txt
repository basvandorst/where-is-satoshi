If the computer recognizes it you may be in luck. I would boot with it as a secondary hdd in another computer, which I think you may have done. alot of times passing a magnet over things doesnt work as well as they try to make it seem in the movies. so hopefully you have something left on there.

@_date: 2013-04-16 14:38:31
Well, it doesn't work. When things go bad people like to have someone to blame, people blame short-sellers. 
“Our research challenges the notion that banning short sales during market downturns limits share price declines,” the NY Fed concludes. “If anything, the bans seem to have the unwanted effects of raising trading costs, lowering market liquidity and preventing short-sellers from rooting out cases of fraud and earnings manipulation.”
It's the same thing with bitcoin, look at all the fools who were saying btc is going to $200,000 buy while you can and stuff like that. As soon as bitcoin crashed they start to blame bots and outside investors and other things that only become a problem to them once they are losing money.
@_date: 2013-04-16 11:58:09
The day traders will not ruin bitcoin, you need people like this to keep the market healthy.
One of the biggest problems I see right now with bitcoin is that there is no easy way to short it, as no exchange has taken it upon themselves to set something up like that. Without being able to short bitcoin, it allows the price to rise to inflated levels.
