3 dollars for coffee, 15 transaction fee, and I have to sit and wait 4 hours for confirmation.

If it weren't for people like the guy who bought a pizza for 10k Bitcoins, we wouldn't be where we are now.

Who said that? I'm not even sure what you are trying to prove.
Stop being a dumbass.

Your point? Market valuation is based on a variety of factors, the largest being actual investments. Of which Bitcoin had very little of, up until until 2013.

Both? What is gold? What is silver?
The only reason the USD is worth anything, is because we say it is. We back it up with our existence.
Your account is literally a living FUD.

Good shit.

I probably just won't pay. I'm small time, so it's not like they give a shit. Going to audit me over me not paying $20?
Not worth my trouble.

Hit me up if you need a loan.

14.4 feels bad. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:39:05
Yep, that's the one! Thanks.

Where do I actually see it for myself, I have seen people post images of them, and that they have been going down over the past few days. The backlog that is.
But what website checks that?

What did it say? Mods removed it.

IT'S HAPPENING BOYYYS
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:22:29
But then I'll incur fees for moving. Isn't there a large log of transactions right now? If I were to wait until there were less, I could incur less fees right?

This. I want to believe in Bitcoin as much as the next guy, but this isn't normal if we look at data.
Not trying to spread FUD, just pointing out the obvious.
I'm still going to hold, even though I bought at majority at 15, feels bad.

Am I the only one seeing Sanskrit or whatever this is? Everyone is replying like they can read it. 
@_date: 2017-12-25 22:18:17
I am just a boobs buying Bitcoin on coinbase.
 Can I use a segwit address on there? If so how?
And is it worth it?

Same. Put another 120 in at 7, was telling my friend at 930 to buy. He said he was going to wait for another dip.
When we got out of the movies an hour ago, I checked my Blockfolio on the way home, and called him. He wants to die since he missed his chance for a lower price by minutes if he'd listened lol.
But now he is buying.

This is good right? What does it mean? Still a noob.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:31:45
Wouldn't it make more sense to report the higher than gains you gave, because you are at greater risk of being audited?
@_date: 2018-06-13 02:03:37
Lmao

What app is that?
