Maybe you miscalculated tax or forgot about a previous transaction until you got up to pay. Maybe your phone crashed. Maybe your phone isn't scanning a payment code correctly.

No, they're not secret (as shown by the email in the OP), they're subject to change without notice. They're a business, and they're allowed to dictate the terms of the business they do within certain guidelines (for instance, they can't arbitrarily choose to refuse service to black folks). If you don't agree to the terms they set, you're welcome to do business elsewhere, as many in the bitcoin community have chosen to do.
I'm not saying it doesn't suck if you want to buy mining equipment online, I'm just saying they're within their rights to say "we don't want to process transactions on a certain type of goods."
@_date: 2014-01-30 20:21:49
I'm not sure how a declined bitcoin transaction would have been significantly different in this situation. In both situations, the electronic transfer of funds fail, the customer gets flustered and embarrassed and their only recourse is to either walk away without their purchase or buy it with whatever kind of physical money they have (fiat cash, bitcoin vouchers, gold coins, whatever).
The only difference I see is that the clerk wouldn't be the one telling them their transaction was declined, which is just as easily solved by having a self-service card swiper instead of one behind the counter.
Am I missing something (not sarcastic)?

I mean, it's not *that* hard to obscure large transactions over the blockchain, is it? Yeah, a mobster would have to be an idiot to send 500 bitcoins to a fellow criminal's address in one go, but five thousand (fifty thousand? Five hundred thousand?) smaller transactions would be harder to trace, no? They didn't bust Silk Road through the blockchain, they did it with traditional sting tactics.

I vote in favor of more strict moderation, and not just with respect to altcoins. "Let the up/downvotes decide" is an easy enough argument, but it really starts to fail once a community gets as large as this one. There are a lot more casual subscribers to this subreddit than active participants and contributors, and those folks aren't always thinking strictly about whether a post is truly germane to the subreddit, if they're paying attention to what subreddit it was posted in at all. If it's interesting to them or provocative enough, it gets the upvote, even when it's not on-topic.
Considering there's both and I see no reason why posts along those lines shouldn't be redirected toward those subreddits where they can be seen and discussed by folks who are interested in those topics.
And to those folks who advocate simply not clicking on links that don't interest them... I find this argument patronizing. Nobody's complaining about the effort it takes to scroll an extra half inch down their reddit front page when an irrelevant article get posted to It's more about promoting a favorable signal-to-noise ratio in the subreddit. When people come here and the top ten posts are about altcoins and general financial news, it means that this subreddit is not as useful a resource for learning about and discussing *bitcoin*.

Well of there are places that accept bitcoin legitimately *now*. We're talking about your hypothetical scenario of bitcoin being forced into a black market through heavy-handed regulation.
Your explanation utterly fails to address what I'm talking about. If governments make it illegal to buy bitcoins and illegal to sell bitcoins and illegal to accept bitcoins as currency (through whatever means they have available to them, which are considerable), it doesn't matter how "interesting" bitcoins are. There will be zero incentive to use them because they will cease to have value as a currency.

You're missing my point; I'm really not trying to be confrontational here. My "who gives a fuck" statement is completely unrelated to the fact that I don't think this community exists to settle outside arguments.
I'm just saying that your argument, at it's core, is not about bitcoin, even if that's what spurred it. Nothing about bitcoin is in contention. You guys are arguing over semantic interpretations of the term "fiat currency": whether "fiat currency" is limited only to those monies given value by a government or whether it can include other monies given value by a non-government entity/group. I said "who gives a fuck" because it's an argument over the subjective interpretation of a broadly defined phrase, ie. the kind of argument that neither side will ever win.
Edit: This is like arguing about whether a tomato is a vegetable or not. It doesn't change or have anything to do with the intrinsic characteristics of the tomato, like it's taste or nutritional value. Rather, it's just bickering about which person's interpretation of "vegetable" is better. Nobody's wrong, you're just defining your terms differently.

Where is there enough of a concentration of bitcoin users to make this cost-effective?
Edit: Thanks for the downvotes everyone. In the meantime, would someone care to take an actual crack at this question from a business owners' perspective?
I understand that the physical cost of implementation is probably pretty low, but you'd still have to spend time training your employees to use a new system. How often can you expect a bitcoin customer to come in? Is it going to take an extra 30 minutes for your employees to remember how to accept bitcoins every time? I'm very curious whether there are specific areas with enough bitcoiners to make this feasible. Right now, we have a climate where a lot of *online* bitcoin businesses--who should theoretically be able to reach the entire bitcoin community--are going belly-up; can a physical business expect bitcoin payment to actually increase business or will it just sit unused?

It seems that cash would be easier for most folk, as in-person transactions will no longer run the same risk. I suppose some percentage of the anonymous percentage will still want to order online, but I get the feeling most folks use SR because what they want is not available locally. Staying anonymous is what allowed the online black market to exist, but it isn't what makes it attractive.
Also, there might be some resistance from finance companies at first, but I see no reason why they'd want to keep turning down free money, assuming we're talking about actual legalization and not something that merely pushes drugs into a grey market. We haven't seen them turn down payments for bongs or medical marijuana bought legally.
@_date: 2012-12-25 20:11:24
That's fair I guess. I had a feeling it boiled down to one of those kinds of issues; people who get really into security/privacy tend to desire it on principal rather than practicality. No judgement on that, as I tend to lean that direction too.

Fair enough. You're absolutely right that the method listed is probably traceable.
@_date: 2012-07-02 20:20:57
In that case, there's still a huge divide between a bitcoin's intrinsic value and its accepted value, so BBQcopter's point still stands. The value that has been assigned to bitcoins is independent of any intrinsic value they have.
@_date: 2012-06-05 04:39:20
There's nothing illegal about bitcoins inherently, so there's no inherent need for anonymity. Some hacker/libertarian-types prefer privacy on principle, but if you have to ask this question, I assume that doesn't apply to you.
If you're planning on using bitcoins for illegal activities, then yes, of course you would be better off being anonymous--bitcoins are dead easy to track and there are any number of places along the way where your bitcoins might be tied to your identity. If you're planning something illegal, I would very seriously think twice about using bitcoins until your understanding of the system is vastly more complete.
@_date: 2012-08-08 20:45:52
Definitely going down. The most recent price rise has been speculation-fueled and the bubble is about to burst.
@_date: 2012-06-05 03:37:51
Besides the fact that the OP didn't mention any paranoia about being traced, most all fiat money to bitcoin transactions are going to be somewhat traceable. Unless you have a trusted source to sell you bitcoins for cash, you're better off anonymizing your wallet *after* you buy the bitcoins, unless there's some odd reason you need to specifically conceal the fact that you've purchased bitcoins at all.
@_date: 2012-07-21 18:50:35
I mean, I get your first point, but is there an IRL bitcoin "community" anywhere? It's going to take more than one person bugging local businesses, you know?

Dollar bills provide some insulation against the imminent nuclear winter. Bitcoins would simply be lost in the EMPs.
@_date: 2012-04-24 19:15:56
Well, for one, we're already seeing a lot of economic and social instability in highly connected nations (think about Greece, Egypt)... Bitcoin might not be ideal for the specific situations we've seen, but I think it's certainly a plausible situation within the decade.
Second, there are a number of experiments that turn bitcoins into physical currencies. Give the currency a bit of time to mature, and I'm sure we'll see more of it. This certainly could aid adoption in less-connected areas.
@_date: 2012-08-28 03:04:17
I agree that there is an audience, I just don't think it's a very significant portion of the overall potential. I can't imagine that there are a lot of folks who wish to keep their donations to Reddit anonymous, and similarly, I can't imagine someone who wants to donate being deterred by the lack of a btc option--for the example you gave, for instance, it's impossible to know how many of those donations would have come in through other means if btcs couldn't be donated.
I'm sure that there are a few non-donating members of this community who might donate if it were an option, but I just don't see that number being very high in the grand scheme of things.
@_date: 2012-07-21 19:33:09
Yeah, I don't know anyone else who uses them. I have a lot of friends who are vaguely interested, but when I start explaining how one obtains bitcoins, their eyes glaze over. The benefits of bitcoin over fiat currency are just not tangible enough for them to justify keeping a separate bitcoin wallet (not to mention paying the exchange fees).
I think IRL applications will come, but not before a more robust online economy gets going. Once we see more folks whose primary incomes comes to them in bitcoin to begin with, we'll see a greater expansion offline.

@_date: 2012-08-28 03:40:00
I can only assume it boils down to "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Every argument being put forth ITT as to why reddit should be accepting bitcoins applies to *literally every other person or business in the world that accepts money*. Sure, maybe reddit's demographic is slightly more likely to use bitcoins, but that doesn't necessarily translate into more donations.
When it comes down to it, you've really hit on the only real reason to implement btc donations: there's no reason not to. In big business, a lack of disadvantage just isn't typically enough to get folks to change from the tried-and-true. That's what small start-ups are better at.

It's acceptable to discuss things here, it's not acceptable to post your thread from elsewhere on reddit with no context except the implication that the other guy is wrong. That isn't spurring discussion, that's asking us to win your Internet argument for you.
Like I said, you guys aren't even arguing about whether bitcoin is fiat currency or not. You both agree entirely on what bitcoin is and isn't. You're arguing about what "fiat currency" means.

@_date: 2012-03-02 23:09:33
Maybe it's for the long game, but if nobody has any faith in the currency, nobody's going to bother structuring businesses around it.
I just feel like for every cool new bitcoin idea that gets put out there, there's three or four businesses shutting down, and not always because they don't have a sustainable business plan--the hacks are a big deal too. Eventually things could smooth out, but I could also see bitcoin losing its critical enthusiasm mass before that happens.
Just my take.
@_date: 2012-07-29 07:33:35
Was it in a case where you were selling a non-tangible item? As I understand it, there is no protection for non-tangible item transactions.
@_date: 2012-12-25 05:27:19
Can I ask why? Obviously, if it's sensitive, I don't need to know, but it just seems to me that it would be almost universally more simple to just buy bitcoins on the clearnet and anonymize them or buy them with cash offline if anonymity is your only goal.
@_date: 2012-08-13 15:37:51

@_date: 2012-07-14 00:55:06
I mean, we all know that bitcoin has conceptual advantages that keep stacking up. That much is obvious to anyone with even a passing interest in bitcoin.
I'm just trying to warn of confirmation bias. When you read on a daily basis, it's easy to forget that 99.99% of folks don't even know what a bitcoin is. For those folks, I'm willing to bet that they will take a 3% hit on some purchases, as opposed to converting their cash into a volatile computer currency they don't understand. Never underestimate the power of laziness and ignorance.
That all said, I don't want to come off as a doomsayer. One major backer pushing bitcoin could be the only push it needs. If I knew what the future held, I'd be doing something that rich people do.

I have used a moneygram at Walmart before. No red phone, just fill out a form and hand it to the cashier at the money center. It asks for personal details, but as far as I can tell, they are never eroded in any way; never asked for my ID or anything. There were at least two cameras on me at any one time, but I suppose a ball cap and sunglasses would partially cover that if it really worries you.
From what I've read, it sounds like moneygram transactions are pretty inconsistent with the amount of personal info they gather and/or verify. Sometimes they give you the third degree, check your DL, the whole shebang, and other places will just send the money, no questions asked. It seems as though, in a way, this makes the whole thing more secure; whatever records are kept must be a bureaucratic nightmare.

My first concern was simply that I think it's bad manners to link to an argument you're having with only the implication that the other guy is wrong. Relevant to our community or not, it just felt like you were trying rouse a posse of folks you thought would agree with you to make sure this guy knew he was wrong. I understand that this might not have been your intention, so apologies for being accusatory. I just personally think it's better reddiquette to handle this kind of situation in a different way: summarizing the discussion you had and asking for opinions or even taking a screenshot of the comments in question and posting them. We still get all the educational value that you're talking about, while avoiding any possible appearance of intentionally adding fuel to a flame war.
My second, and entirely separate point, was that your argument was more over the semantics of the phrase "fiat currency" than anything intrinsic to Bitcoin. This point was not meant to imply that your subject was off-topic, it was only meant to add to the discussion; really, it's mostly the same point that BBQcopter is making up above me. The "who gives a fuck" comment was my unfortunately blunt way of saying that arguing about semantics is ultimately pointless; it wasn't meant in any way to imply that the readers of don't give a fuck about discussions like this.
Hope this clears up what I was getting at. I'm sick of the downvotes too.

I don't necessarily agree with the OP that bitcoins are poised for exponential adoption, but I don't really understand your reasoning either.
It seems to me that bitcoins have taken off where there was a niche that needed filling—where it was *convenient* for them to be used. I don't see anything "inappropriate" about buying coffee with them, and I don't see any inherent barriers to such adoption.
Care to explain further?

Same way virtually every other member of the economy could omit bitcoin as a payment option? I mean, I know there are all the hypothetical advantages, but it just isn't that big of an audience.
@_date: 2012-06-23 22:00:35
Where you're thinking "when," everyone else, *especially* those running publicly traded companies, is thinking "if."
Right now, there's no guarantee that bitcoin will become anything more than a footnote in history; to act according to predictions that it will not only become a major currency, but actually topple the financial systems we know is *hugely* presumptuous. I could honestly see Apple getting involved if things move beyond the fringe, but that's where things are right now.

Yeah, ok, I've heard the slogans over and over, but some ecosystems just can't support life.
There's a breaking point and at some point, people aren't going to keep investing in a platform where all the biggest players continue to wither and die. I'm not saying we're there yet, but I think the 'survival of the fittest' cheering every time someone goes out of business or gets hacked is a bit pointless. It's not like we're dealing with a mature economy here, we're dealing with something very new and volatile.

I agree with almost everything you said.
My only nitpick: I really dislike the phrase "anonymous Internet money." For one, it oversimplifies the tricky anonymity issues of bitcoin. More importantly though, it emphasizes aspects of bitcoin that are not entirely central to the concept of unregulated crypto-currency.
Basically, that it can be used anonymously and that it can be used on the Internet are both nice, but if that's your pitch to the gold+silver guys, it's no wonder they don't like bitcoin. Neither are inherent to the bitcoin design--it's a fairly trivial matter to turn bitcoins into a physical commodity that can be traded under one's real identity.
Unless I've misunderstood your use of the phrase?
@_date: 2012-06-23 19:07:09
Apple wouldn't invest in an open source project like that. If anything, they'd form their own offshoot, but so long as fiat money is still worth something, it ain't happening. They're in the tech business, not finance.

Guy asked why something should be illegal. Dude responded pointing out that it wasn't illegal in the first place. Question answered.
@_date: 2013-06-06 21:38:56
To be fair, it's going to be hard to attribute it to any one thing. During that same period, laws were made more strict and enforcement was increased, but education was also massively stepped up.
Personally, I can sympathize with the idea that it is not drunk driving per se that should be illegal. It's not the fact one one drank and then drove that is the crime, but rather than one unnecessarily put the lives of others at risk.
@_date: 2013-12-14 16:18:54
Yes, that's exactly what I'm getting at. I hate freedom. *commence eye roll sequence*
What I'm getting at is that the insane amount of customization options means that every android a consumer picks up is a different user experience, sometimes radically so. Metaphors don't stay as consistent from device to device, or even within the same device at times. If you're up to the task of customizing everything to your needs and desires, then you have an incredibly powerful tool for doing so, but that's just not something everyone is interested in.
I probably shouldn't have called it worse; I tried to qualify it with "tends to be." It has been my own personal experience, but I didn't make it clear I was expressing an opinion rather than objective fact. I just mean that the Android experience is wildly inconsistent, which makes it seem inferior to newcomers (like myself) who haven't had a chance to tailor their own device.
It's two very different design philosophies. They each have their merits. I prefer Apple's design, even if its software is less versatile.

* If you're going to claim that a law against drunk driving causes more harm to society than good, you need to back it up with evidence.
* These are all decent arguments against the current justice system, but not really against the concept of outlawing behaviors that risk the safety of others in general.


The threat of a DUI may or may not be an effective deterrent, but physically removing a visibly drunk driver from the road *definitely* mitigates the risk to others.

Ah yes, let's skip right to the name calling. You're clearly interested in having a real conversation about this. Not sure what you think I'm lying about, since all I did was recount the last few comments of this thread for you, but that's fine.
Edit: Just to be more clear, the question the first guy should be asking isn't "Why should carrying $10,000 across the border be illegal?" (because it isn't, as pointed out by the second dude), but rather "Why should you be required to declare your $10,000 in cash to the government in order to travel freely?"
@_date: 2013-06-06 22:06:41
Incarceration is a whole new can of worms. As for being an idiot, I don't much have a problem with it until it infringes (or significantly risks infringing) on others.
I know "risk of infringement" sounds like a slippery slope, but only really in the philosophical sense. In practice, it isn't impossible to get a community of people to agree on certain behaviors they deem too risky to the safety of others to allow. True, the current governmental entities of the world have created some oddball laws (the example of driving drunk on your own uninhabited property came up earlier), but that's more of an argument against bureaucracy than against the concept preventative/mitigating laws.
(Also, fwiw, there are of course laws on the books designed to prevent the authorities from ever finding out about your private drunk-driving adventures, even if the act itself remains illegal. So long as you don't hurt anyone else [which would mean that your activities risked the safety of others in the first place, which made it a crime in my book anyway], punitive action of any kind is extremely unlikely. Maybe still wrong on principle, but something to think about when discussing this stuff in the context of the real world. Sorry for the tangent.)
@_date: 2013-06-07 05:25:57


Were we arguing? I'm genuinely curious if your claim that drunk driving laws do more harm than good has any substance; I hadn't yet seen this claim.


Of course not. I hope I didn't imply anything of the sort. In any case, this is again more of a complaint against a particular application of the state's force, not against the concept of laws against behaviors that put others in harm's way.

It's not pedantry, it's marketing. The point is not to be objectively correct, but rather to present bitcoins in a more appealing way. Considering the implications of the word "virtual," I think it's entirely appropriate.
Would you call your MP3 collection "virtual music"?
@_date: 2013-12-21 03:01:44
I said as much up above somewheres, but I think it bears repeating:
The point of a discussion like this is not to arrive at an objectively correct description of bitcoin (a Sisyphean, if not outright impossible, task), but rather to come to an acceptably accurate description of bitcoin that inspires confidence on a wide scale.
One could make a case that "virtual currency" is an accurate way to describe bitcoin, but the use of the word "virtual" implies that bitcoin is nearly, but not actually, currency.
One could also easily make the case that your suggestions are accurate descriptors, but they have even less wide appeal. People don't walk around calling the dollars in their pocket "fiat currency," even though it's more descriptive and informative than "cash."

Your point was that the roads should be some kind of insane, Darwinist death game, and when someone pointed out that unsafe drivers can kill or maim otherwise innocent victims, you whiplash over to the insanity that is "if a law cannot prevent all bad things from happening, we are better off without laws." Stick to the point.


I posit the opposite of whatever you posit. Since neither of us has a lick of evidence, we can just call this a wash.


There's that, maybe. There's also the fact that police can pull over a drunk/reckless driver and take them off the road *before* they commit what the OP thinks is a "real" crime. Not everyone is as rational about self-preservation as you or I, and I'm hard-pressed to think of a reason those with poor impulse control should be allowed to endanger the lives and livelihoods of those around them. Even if a law doesn't completely eliminate crime, mitigation is better than nothing.

We found some sort of master password that allowed an admin to log into any account on the network.
When they figured out that someone had learned the password (never realized it was us), they changed it. For the life of me, I can't remember the second password, but it was simple enough that we guessed it as well within a couple of days.
