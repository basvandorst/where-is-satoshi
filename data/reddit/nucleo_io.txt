We only support payment methods which are know that bank chargebacks are not easily possible (e.g. we will not support paypal). But there is an open risk here because basically every bank can make a chargeback specially if a crime is involved (Alice used a stolen bank account).
In that case the arbitrator cannot help anymore as the BTC payment has been already released. But Bob can contact the arbitrator to report that fraud and the arbitrator will put Alice on a global fraud report. That will make Alice's account useless, as every trader will check the other peer against that fraud report before starting a trade.
Of course Alice could just register a new account and repeat the scam. But there are certain reasons why that will not be efficient for her.
1. We store the encrypted bank account details in the blockchain with the registration. During the trade process the other trader can verify that the bank details are matching the one from the registration. So Alice cannot reuse her bank account. She need to use another bank account. But she cannot create 100s of bank accounts as that will alert the banks with AML monitoring. So her potential repeat rate is limited.  
2. The trade volume is limited. The limit will be initially small like 1 or 2 btc, later we can relax that limit up to 5 or 10 btc, depending on the experience. A criminal using a stolen bank account want to cash out all the money in once not only a few hundred dollars. So Bitsquare will not be a good option for him.  
3. If Alice repeat to request a bank chargeback she will make herself suspicious to her bank. For most banks it is a lot of paper work and they don't start that process easily (see above we will not support those where chargeback is easy).  
4. If there is a high fraud rate additional security measurement can be used. We will offer OPTIONAL bank account and/or identity verification against an arbitrator. So if a user decides he wants to have a higher reputation with an "I am verified" icon, he can do that, but its completely optional. Only the arbitrator knows then the bank account data or in case of ID verification the data used for ID verification (different levels from social network ID to real life ID). We think that this measurement might be only needed in regions with a general higher fraud rate. The user can define from which country (seat of bank account) he accepts trades, so regions with a high fraud rate will stay isolated and will trigger those additional measurements to make the trade safer there.  
5. Every trade contains a contract signed by both parties. In fraud case the users can use that contract out of system to use the traditional legal system. Again that is completely optional, we don't support that in any form directly, but the contract which is available might be useful if a user will go that path.  
In summary: We try to minimize that risk by a set of measurements and to try to make it not preferable for criminals to use Bitsquare for their activities.  
There will never be a 100% safety, same like for any other process where money is involved (a friend of mine was victim of a stolen bank account case at localbitcoin and lost his money, remember MtGox,...)

I am planning to rename the project to **BitSquare** (bitsquare.io).
What do you guys think about that name? Is is a good name?
The reasons for a change are: 
- It helps the project more if it is a more neutral name. Bankrun has some provocative and political touch. I like it but for more mainstream people it might be too extreme. For the project it is better if those mainstream people use it as well. The bigger the user base the better.
- I will redefine the project it a bit into a more generic P2P market place. You can buy anything for BTC. Fiat or any goods. Transport of the non BTC thing will be post or if fiat also bank. The concept is exactly the same. 
So BitSquare is more generic: Square as a symbol for people to meet to interact. 
Satoshi square was some inspiration for it....

Another lesson to not trust central infrastructure for our decentralized bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:18:57
Everything is decentralized. There is no company behind it, all is open source, there is no one who holds the fiat nor the btc. Btc is hold in a 2of3 MultiSig and fiat is transferred directly (like in localbitcoin).
So main differences:  
- Bitsquare does not hold any bitcoin  
- Bitsquare does not know the trade participants, therefor cannot collect private data of them  
- Bitsquare does not do the arbitration directly (in case of dispute) but use a decentralized and open arbitration  system  
- Bitsquare is no company its an open source project  
- You dont have any KYC style registration

Hi, I follow that project a while and like the basic ideas a lot!
But I have a few questions also:
- I saw in the code base some code for a server. Which role does that play?
- How many payment processors will you support? Will it be open also to use without those processors? What if the gov shut down those 2 or 3 companies, or force them to shut down their APIs? 
- Isn´t it too much restriction with the payment processors for people not having access to them (China)?
- How fast are the payments? With several rounds the trade will take much longer...
- How do you protect agains blackmail attacks? The rounds may minimize the risk but the users can define to use just 1 round, right?
- How do you protect against system attacks (e.g. NSA or big banks trying to bring it down, they don't care about costs, or a competitor take some costs in account to kill a competing project)
- What if the peer cannot continue without bad intention (death, harddisc crash,...)?

If Bitcoin would go in that direction there would be no reason why we use it at all. We could stick with governmental/banks controlled money.
When you start with that, where is the line to seperate other cases? It may start with something very clear for nearly all people, but will lead soon to the form of censorship we have seen with Wikileaks/Banks. 
A technological infrastructure is not a tool for executing political/ethical problems. It is designed to be NEUTRAL. If you break that you introduce much more problems than you solve.
Maybe its easier if you see it as layers:
Bitcoin is a basic neutral layer. There will and can be higher layers which have more complex interactions with different kind of problems. Those layers could be interchanged if some will not work well in reality.
But the basic layers need to stay free of any political/ethical influence.
It would be like to censor from the alphabet the letters which are used for bad words ;-).
Nobody suggests that we need to control the alphabet. 
If somebody publish a racist statement or make false accusations in public we have some tools to fight that. To fight on the base layer is simply wrong and would just destroy that layer itself.
So what you are suggesting is a direct attack on Bitcoin.

I will investiage the chargeback issue and add the results ot the paper. In the EU with SEPA there is no chargeback AFAIK, at least with my bank I know it for sure.
I have also another idea how to solve that problem (if its a problem). Will add that to the paper soon.
The banks does not know its BTC trade related. If you do a private person-person tx and don't mark it as "BTC trade" the bank has no clue about the nature of the tx. The difference to localBitcoin is that the government/banks can shut down a company or their bank account (China). But they cannot shut down 1000s of private bank accounts.
They can communicate. As long as both a honest they can find a way to solve problems. I will also add a rollback feature. So if both agree they can make all btc tx undone.
Optional an escrow could be added as well.


But why not win money instead of losing it, if the only thing to do is click a button.
Nash does not cover 3 things:
- sadists
- political attacker (bring down the system at any cost)
- economic attacker against the system(take in account a loss to win outside the system -see gold silver manipulation) 
I will add a solution for the system attackers soon in the paper.
Against sadists a reputation system will be probably the onyl solution, but have another idea in mind also, but that needs more time to layout. 
Will add all that to the paper soon...
There is never a perfect solution, also BTC is not perfect. We can only aim to go in the right direction. 
At least the centralized exchanges are a real problem and a wrong part in eco system for a decentralized currency.

If any party does not receive his money (either fiat or btc) then they can call the arbitrator. The arbitrator investigate to find out who was failing the contract and take the security deposit form the failed trader and pay out the fund form the 2of3 MultiSig to the honest trader.
The arbitrator can either work wiht traditional methods (like localbitcoin escrows would investigate) or they can use a cryptographically secure method to find out the true state of both bank accounts by using TLSNotary (

In fact exactly the same structure can be used for a P2P market. Replace the Fiat with an article to sell and the Bank transfer with sending the article by mail. There is it the P2P market. The collateral should be probably higher then with Fiat, but that can be choosen freely....

The fiat is transferred from one users bank account to the other. To prevent scam there is an arbitration system as main protection. The arbitration system itself is also P2P and decentralized. Think of it as localBitcoin but without company and any central entities.

There is much wrong with all those centralized exchanges and infrastructure around Bitcoin. It is a shame that there are still nearly no decentralized solutions for a crypto currency which was not designed in a decentralized way by chance.

@_date: 2014-02-14 15:21:30
Ok I understand your point now. I see that as a basic risk with Fiat and as the whole concept is designed to work inside the legal framework there is not problem to explain the bank that you bought btc with that tx. The government will forbid companies to deal with btc not private persons. In the case that it gets completely illegal, like it seem to be in Russia now, the usage of the tool will be illegal as well, so we will not recommend that. If people use it, they have to know and take the risks (also with undercover agents).
I am thinking of a way to introduce a legal contract which gets signed by both. That way a lot of the problems could get solved. But I need to think more about that and dont want to discuss that now (otherwise I spent all my time on Reddit an dbtcTalk ;-)). I plan to update the paper in a few days, with more details about the raised questions and problems.
It seems that a few things needs better explainations and also more investigations (reversibility).

@_date: 2014-05-31 10:49:13
Nice approach, but I see a few fundamental flaws with that concept:
- The trade time is very slow: if you have 100 rounds it is 100 times the payment processors tx time (which might be a few minutes for OKPay and hours or days for normal bank tx). What is the actual tx time for OKPay?
- To keep that trade time acceptable you are restricted to those payment processors with open API (Okpay,...). There are not many of those available, so it is very limited to a few companies. If the government wants to stop that kind of exchange, they just have to make pressure to a handful companies. How many payment processors like OKPay exist? Can you name them? I assume not more then 10.
- It is very easy to track those tx as coinffeine tx due the clear tx pattern (repeated micro payments). 
- It is questionable if the payment processors will support/accept that, as they normally dont take a fee assuming a client average behaviour of a few tx per month. If you make 100s or 1000s of tx a month it produces more costs to the bank as they will earn with that client, so an economic orientated bank will kick out that client. If they take a fee the exchange becomes too expensive.
- In case of higher price volatility (very common in btc) there is an incentive to change the strategy and take the loss of the collateral in account to start a new trade taking the advantage of the new better price. That is more risky the lower the collateral is/the more rounds you use. For 100 rounds it means 1% of price change which can lead to a strategy change. At localBitcoin that kind of "future trading" is a common problem.
- If you reduce the rounds to a lower number and increase the risk value per round than you get a serious blackmail risk. E.g. if you trade 2 btc for 1000 EUR and make 10 rounds you have a risk of 100EUR/0.2 BTC. As there is an asymmetric risk stake (one lose more then the other), a scammer could use that weak point to blackmail the other party with a signed tx where he change the output to his favor. That way the other peer can decide to accept the blackmail and lose 0.05 btc or not accept it and lose 0.1 btc. An economic rational trader will accept, so following game theory that will lead to a failure of the exchange. You can only mitigate that problem with lowering the risk stake which means more rounds which comes with the usability problem of longer time and depending on the payment processor with too high overall fees and with the above mentioned risk of price changes.
- There is no protection against an system attacker (competitor, nation state, banks...) who takes in account financial losses to ruin the trust/usability of the exchange system.
- I assume (not sure about that, have not read all the details) that there is a double spend risk, as the first deposit tx has a timeout the BTC seller could have spent with another tx the inputs makeing the following tx invalid. If the other peer has already done the bank tx he would lose those payments.
- I assume (also not sure about that) that there is a malleability risk as well with the dependency of the payout tx to the pay-in tx. You cannot use reliable a tx id as long that tx is not in the blockchain.
- The case that the other peer cannot continue due unintended problems (accident, disc crash, death,....) cannot be covered by a 2 of 2 Multisig locked tx.
And my last concern: 
- Who is behind that project? You got some funding from investors but there are no details open to the public. What is the business model behind it? An investor wants to earn money some day. If you dont take fees how they should earn money? 
The only speculative idea which comes to my mind is that some parties might be interested to get an pseudo decentralized exchange. In such an exchange the information flows over a few payment processors, so it would be very easy to gather the information about all the trades of such an "decentralized" fiat-btc exchange. So it could be used as honeypot attracting people who avoid centralized exchanges due the regulation and control they have about their clients. The promise that the privacy is only leaked to the other trader is not true if there is not a huge variety of banks you can use and if the bank tx is easily detectable. And as stated above normal banks will lead to unusable slow trading times, so it will be limited to those few payment processors.
Sorry for beeing so negative, I would love to see some decentralized Fiat-BTC exchanges. I just see too many open unanswered questions combined with too much marketing and snobbish statements like "we already have code whereas most of the other projects are still in the idea phase".
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:12:10
Change the bank. There are many payment processors out, where you can open a free account quickly. Banks which are just useful for tax payment should be called differently.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:22:51


In reality it will not be a problem as long other exchanges exist. You can even buy a tiny amount in forums or get from some faucets. Also the collateral could be set to 0 for very small trading volumes. There is no risk that the other could steal something, just the risk the he does not continue the process and your funds are locked. But assuming a non sadistic peer that should be also no big problem in reality.
NOTE that even in that case there is no economic reason to behave unfair - no possibility to steal the others funds. Just the possibility to hurt the other without winning anything for yourself -&gt; sadistic behavior.

That is the logical consequence of centralized exchanges for bitcoin and probably the only reason why the governments are not more restrictive with bitcoin. They know that they have full control over those companies - they are like banks basically, and bitcoin has very poor anonymity properties. Combine that and you have a pretty powerful tracking tool only accessible to governments and those exchanges.  
Thats why decentralized exchanges are needed like  or decentralized marketplaces like

Thats why we need 
@_date: 2014-12-24 14:28:56
That is why the gateways are so critical:  
If you are able to connect a real persons ID to a bitcoin tx ID you have the starting point for tracking that tx to the next points where it leaves the blockchain to another gateway.  
That graph reflects important relationships and a government who has much more data for cross-mapping can derive quite a lot of information out of that.  
All those centralized exchanges are perfect gateways to create those financial information graphs and therefore lay out the base ground for such potential surveilance.  
The mechanics of our capitalistic society makes is nearly impossible for real decentralized systems to compete with the centralized models due lack of business models (how to earn money with decentralized projects?).  
That begins that you cannot even gain some press coverage for such projects without paying for press coverage or if you are not fitting in the VC dominated and regulatory friendly new bitcoin economy.  
How much have you read about real decentralised projects (i don't mean those who just use decentralised as marketing term) in the bitcoin media? And how much do you read about company X receives Y $ for just another centralized service?  
Bitcoin might fail due the lack of decentralised infrastructure.

The proposed system could be automated when using APIs of money transmitters. Setting up a local trading agent who auto trade should be possible in theory. BUt the first goal is to keep is as simple as possible to make it more realistic that it will get developed. Also to be easy to use and to understand.
For more complex solutions like you described above, you also need to consider the legal framework. As soon as you are handling money in behalf of another person you are confronted with regulation issues. Only person to person trade is private and out of the scope of regulation (as far as I know/understand).

@_date: 2014-02-25 12:48:13
I think there is another problem in the concept: 
The fiat micropayments (break up the trade in small chunks) are easily trackable. So if governments start to make preasure to btc bank interactions (China) they will easily spot those bank tx as bitcoin trades and force the bank to prevent that (shut down the account).
EDIT (Added):
And another problem is the trust problem into the software which controls the OKPay bank account.
For non-tech people it is impossible to prove that your software is not a malware and may steal from your account. That might be more a communication problem then a real technical risk (2FA) but it will be hard to convince people to trust you. Even for tech people it will take much effort and time to read all the code and compile it on their machine to be sure it is not a malware. 
Also access to a bank account attract criminals even more then access to a btc wallet. So your project will be targeted by them. 
Don't get me wrong. I appreciate that you are working on a solution for a P2P Fiat exchange, but I think there are more problems in the way as one may think initially (my experience). And to deal with money is serious business.

Interesting project!
I have just 2 things I consider problematic:
1. All is based on a centralized infrastructure (servers), which is a basic problem of all lightweight wallets, but becomes a real problem if more users would use mobile wallets (specially in developing countries) and the idea behind bitcoin is the contrary - decentralization.
2. I personally does not feel comfortable to meet a unknown person and exchange cash with him. It depends much on the country/culture, in some places it would be a invitation to get robbed, even if the system is designed that you cannot get robbed of your btc. Thats the same issue with localBitcoin. I was never even considering to use the "meet in person" solution there, just the bank transfer option. 
But beside that, I appreciate a move to more "decentralized" trading solutions! We must get rid of the dependency to centralized exchanges/banks IMO.

- Add account (identity connected with bank account nr.), a reputation system based on successful trades and a blacklist for banning teh account of fraudsters.
- Add incentive to earn money when trading closest to the average price (See chapter Market maker in the paper for more info)
- Use contract to define all the trade details
I think that concept is now sound and we will move forward to the technical side.
It is of course a lot of work to implement that all, but many parts can be seen as optional for the first step.
With a modular architecture those parts can be added, improved or excahnged over time.
Any input/analysis/criticism is welcome!
And of course if you are interested to join us, we need more dev and brain forces!
We are also on IRC freenode 
The paper will be transferred soon to the wiki on

I assume you can build a P2P marketplace based on that idea as well, but I have not elaborated closer yet....

Was not my idea, the idea was already used in several projects. In fact Satoshi described early an escrowed marketplace which is not far away from that concept as well.

What makes a merchant service?   
1. Easy to integrate payment solution  
2. Fast conversion to Fiat  
Alternatives to existing:  
-&gt; 1. Selfhosted readymade systems like Wordpress did for publishing  
-&gt; 2. Trading bot on a decentralized exchange  
I know both does are not available atm, but not because its so impossible but because decentralized systems lack of business models for investors and therefore the money flows to the old school systems, making bitcoin less a decentralized solution as it could be.

Same when you buy from ebay and get your money via bank transfer.
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:37:13


That cannot happen until Guy B has signed the payout tx.
There is no situation wher you can steal the others funds. The collateral only serve as incentive that they behave fair and dont create aloss for the other party (without winning anything for themself). With collateral alway both lose something if one behaves unfair. Escrow is only needed if one trader would die or a hard disc crash. That should be so rare that with small trading volumes it could be taken as kind of "trading fee".
E.g. if one trade of 1000 fails you have a fee of 0.1% overall.

They are based on a payment processor who can track all micropayments to a bitcoin trade - so not much different to a centralized exchange.

Thanks! ;-)
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:53:03
Yes in that case the collateral was too low. The offerer can choose the height. I was only considering price volatility which could lead to the same situation (even the time window is normally very small between tx publishing and bank transfer), but that the bank transfer cost are not known before and could lead to a cut I did not consider, but that is a possible situation. But jsut increase the collateral to 20% /20 USD and all is fine again. The 10% was just an example. 
But thanks for the input!

And for the tl;dr generation: 
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:18:36
At the end its a political statement. A P2P exchange can never compete with the comforts and features of a company exchange (or maybe some day, like BTC is superio to Fiat). To use it is a statement against the control of banks and governments.

Does anybody know more details about these projects?
coinffeine is from the same guys who have published a whitepaper on pauv.org (not available anymore). 
It is based on a very similar idea (Nash equilibrium).
Seems pretty different to my approach

Good so if banks close business accounts. Bitcoin have to live in a decentralized environment without the new Amazon (overstock), Visa(bitpay) and Goldman Sachs(circle).
Whats really needed are P2P market places, exchanges and services. The people who pushing Bitcoin mainstream are betraying the original reason why bitcoin was created. It is not just a new payment system. It is a DECENTRALIZED system. Thats the real difference. Where we see that replicated in the bitcoin ecosystem? ATM nearly nowhere. That is the real problem. 
@_date: 2014-10-28 16:51:00
And they only become active in case of a dispute.

Yes we are open source ( and we will offer a way for adding country specific payment channels, but we also want to be sure they are safe against bank chargeback.   
Details are not defined yet as we need to research more the specifics of different countries and payment channels.  
We have an open issue in github specially for that:  
If anybody likes to help us here it would be very appreciated!

Centralized solutions for a decentralized currency is a contradiction!
@_date: 2014-11-05 17:47:05
We are focussed on currency exchange. Open Bazaar is a general purpose market place. Initially we only support BTC and any Fiat currency. Later we want to add BTC to alt coins exchange. It might grow to a market place as well, but thats probably then another project. 
@_date: 2014-08-27 11:10:39
We will discuss that, thanks for the interest!

Congratulations! Looks awesome!

If anyone cheat, both lose. You cannot win money with cheating. if you play fair the trade will complete like inteded, so that is a win over the cheat model (where you lose for sure as well as the other). there are 2 situtaions where they can cheat the possible loss is one time higher for Alice, and one time higher for Bob so overall fair distributed.
@_date: 2014-02-25 12:30:19
yet we are 4. but open to more of course. but still in the concept phase...
@_date: 2014-06-25 14:03:50
Donation models might work for a few projects (with enough marketing, luck or big names) but there are much more projects which nearly got anything with donations or crowd funding. So that model is pretty limited. Unfortunately the "tragedy of the commons" tells you that people who dont contribute to the overall success of bitcoin will gain more, so it is a negative incentive to be active and spend work/btc to work on a btc open source project. Why it is still working and projects get developed will have many different reasons, but one thing is true for all those projects (including bitcoin core dev). It does not scale well (you might find a hand full of devs but not much more) and there is work which is simply not so fun to do it as hobby (writing complex test cases,...). Of course there are projects which got super successful like linux, but all in all I think those are the exception and to network effects can make a already successful project even more successful, but it might be very hard for new projects to get into that dynamics.
TLDR; Donations are nice but not enough. OS projects suffer from good funding solutions.
@_date: 2014-02-14 16:00:22
Somethin with Satoshi could be nice...
Satoshi.io - but non-tech people dont understand io....
Also I would prefer something shorter...
 
@_date: 2014-10-28 22:49:38
Regarding Open Bazaar: Yes once Open Bazaar is out you can use that as well. The main difference will be that Bitsquare is specialized on exchange (btc/fiat, later altcoins as well) and openbazaar is a generic market place.   
Open Bazaar is probably the project closest to our philosophy and we share quite a lot of parts from the concept side.
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:07:08
Yes could be that this will go in optionally. I think escrow without SSL dump has not much value as the escrow cannot prove a bank tx screenshot if its real or photoshop...
One goal is the keep all simple and let plugins extend it where necessary.

Yeah it's a shame.  
Would cash by mail be an option in your country. I know that in Spain for instance its illegal to send cash by mail, so that might be a difficult solution as well.  
Later we will also support alt coins instead of fiat, but that will be probablay no help for you as well.  
Can you think of any alternative payment channel for fiat which would work good in your country?   
Meet in person like with localbitcoin might be another option.

In case of a dispute the arbitrator get called to solve the problem. Note that arbitrators are not holding any funds and are not a centralized entity (everybody can become an arbitrator).
@_date: 2014-02-13 16:24:05
Additionally a reputation system could be introduced. It is not elaborated much in the paper, but it could help with the trade with 0 BTC situation.
@_date: 2014-10-28 18:47:44
How do they prove it on localbitcoin and others? They also cannot contact your bank directly. I think they have a set of methods which are all not perfect but work good enough in reality (see  for further description of possible methods).  
The perfect solution is to use TLSNotary. With that the arbitrator can find out without doubt the true state of both users bank account. See  for more details.

No it not like a built-in escrow. It based on the Nash equilibrium concept. See the paper for more details...

Just ansered here a similar question:  
@_date: 2014-12-03 15:25:07
How do you define decentralized?  
My test criterium is the lack of single point of failures.  
And that is certainly not fulfilled by Coinffeine. There are several single point of failure build in just in the basic design (limited to payment processors, micro payment can easily be spotted by the payment processors so the payment processors have control to support that project or shut down those accounts, non disclosed investors - what is the business model?,...).
Beside that the concept has serious security flaws (blackmail like mentioned by 2of2 MS,...)
@_date: 2014-12-24 18:32:43
There are other ways to build fiat-btc exchanges in a decentralized way:  and openbazaar.org are examples that it is feasible (though ambitious).
@_date: 2014-02-14 13:54:41
It is free to choose the collateral. I will discuss that in the paper more as it seems to be not clear enough. 10% should be enough in normal times (volatility). Stay tuned for a paper update in a few days....

Just to clearify, Bitsquare is very different to what you described. See the overview images posted above (
@_date: 2015-01-12 11:39:37
How do you define decentralized?  
I use the "single point of failure" test.  
None of the mentioned projects would pass that test.  
Why is decentralization important?  
- Any central/controlling party who has access to fiat or btc can misuse that control for theft OR hackers use that weak point  
- Any central/controlling party which stores information about the trade process (who trades with whom) might be put under preassure some day to reveal that data to government/tax authority OR use that data to sell out (user data are traded as new oil) OR hackers/NSA just steal that data  
- Bitcoin is only anonymous if you cannot match a address to a person. When you have the information which person bought/sold bitcoin you have a very important coin tainting tool. Coin tainting attacks the fungability of bitcoin and would destroy it as money.
Ask yourself what makes Bitcoin special?  
Low fees? Digital money?... that can be done by other solutions as well (Paypal, Ripple,...).   
What makes Bitcoin really speacial is that there is no single point of failure!  
Satoshi was very aware of the dangers of a system which can be shutdown or corrupted if there is a single point of failure. Maybe that was one of the reasons why he stayed anonymous.  
Satoshis political motivations is documented in some early posts as well in the whitepaper:

Thank you!
@_date: 2015-01-13 00:35:04
We at Bitsquare (bitsquare.io) are working on a fully decentralized fiat-btc exchange. Later it might add crypto to btc as well. To use atomic cross-chain was considered for the crypto-btc part but as the development effort sums up for every altcoin that seems less scalable as to utilize the actual user to check the altcoin block chain and use the arbitration system needed anyway for the fiat variant as main protection mechanism against fraud.  
Time lock does not help against people who are trying to hurt the overall system even if they cannot earn money they might have other incentives (competitor,...). So an additional protection will be necessary IMO. A security deposit is at Bitsquare next to the decentralised arbitration system the main protection.
@_date: 2014-02-13 14:42:12
Yes the software would do all in the background, the user has only simple GUI.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:40:00
Its the relation value-profit. With that argument you would need strict payment controls in every restaurant. One could just leave without paying but 99.99% don't do it. 0 conf payments would only work in similar situations (pay coffee) and not in anonymous relations. Though it has some value and no single dev should have the right to force the whole ecosystem to his idea. That shows again that there is some big problem in that area (beside politics around blocksize). 
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:48:28


We have many "just good enough" products/technologies which have been very successful. Credit cards are a security-wise a disaster though the whole world use it, because it is so easy.
Usability is often in contradiction to security. The right balance is key.
@_date: 2015-07-24 10:55:28
So it RBF will happen Bitcoin is not suitable for fast low-value transactions. 10 minutes is for most those use cases a No-Go. People will move to alternatives (like Ethereum) with very fast confirmation times and which support also 0 conf for low value tx. 
Congrats to remove a potential use case for Bitcoin.
But anyway, it is actually better to move away from that "Bitcoin is king" idea. That carries too many risks anyway. We need a freely floating ecosystem of special purpose currencies which can be exchanged (near) friction-less. Bitcoin will have due its hash-rate it's strong position for a high secured block chain. Others will fill the gaps where Bitcoin is not a proper solution. Nothing which will speed up adoption but good in the long run.
@_date: 2015-07-24 11:08:56
The main achievement of Satoshi was the solution for the double spend problem. It is not perfect but it is getting safer with the number of blocks under which the transaction is buried. 
The 0 conf situation is of course much less secure as when the tx made it to the first block.
Though that is also not a guarantee for a double spend (GHash.io has executed that against a gambling site). With the same argument - that because a double spend is possible for a 0 conf, they will happen, independent on that context (low value tx) - you could claim that if it is possible for miners to misuse their hashing power to double spend a transaction with 1 confirmation they will do it. You clearly don't get a guarantee that this will not happen, thought its clear that it is a question for a personal risk analysis: What can I lose if that happens (a small amount of money), what can I win if I take the risk (time, convenience).
