Everyone has to start somewhere.  They could be doing the research to understand it before actually starting mining.  Not knowing now doesn't mean they'll never know.

It's pseudonymous, not anonymous, and exchanges in the US have to gather your information in order to legally exist.  If you want to avoid the taxman (which I am not recommending), you need to put in a little more effort than trading on Coinbase.

Binance let's you transact and withdraw 2 BTC daily before you need to verify.

You can request higher limits.

That's.. not what fungible means.

Not morally right, but certainly understandable.  If we helped everyone up instead of punishing them for surviving, there'd be less motivation for crime.

If you have millions in Bitcoin, consider taking some gains and investing them in more stable investments like index funds.  Learn about the concept of Enough, and realize when you have it.  Enjoy your life.

You need an emergency fund.  Shoot for $1000 so that you can handle minor surprises.

While lying in bed tonight, my wife asked if I wanted to HODL hands.  We held hands for a bit, then, when I took my hand back, she told me I had weak hands.
Thought you'd all get a kick out of that.

GDAX covers the fee.

It was definitely around since at least April of 2013, since I bought some ~$40 then.
Edit:  And your 2011 must have been before the first crash, since I was buying at $7 in 2012.

Looks like crazy popups and you have to sign up for an account?  No thanks.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:10:28
No, because your cost basis is $1000.  You bought for $1000 and sold for $1000, so your profit is $0, which is the amount on which you owe taxes.  You still need to file it, though.
@_date: 2017-12-30 19:14:39
The forks make holding super annoying.  More coming in 2018!  Ugh.
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:14
Pretty sure you owe the taxes as of time of sale and it'll be on you to get the money you're owed from the exchange.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:28:22
If OP sold for a bunch of money this year, they need to pay quarterly taxes, or they'll be hit with a fine for underpaying.  This isn't the case with a day job because taxes are withheld from every paycheck.
@_date: 2017-12-28 19:50:31
I don't think that's how money works.
@_date: 2017-12-23 05:31:22
Totally 100% true.  
But I'd also like some money.
@_date: 2017-12-18 13:53:31
If you make enough profit, consider paying quarterly taxes; otherwise, you'll be hit with a fine for not paying enough through the year.
If you're not making that much, you can wait until 2019 or increase your withholding at your day job to cover the taxes you will owe.

GDAX covers your fees.
@_date: 2017-12-30 21:26:50
Try to transfer it to GDAX (same company, same login, can transfer immediately).  GDAX covers your fees.

They make money on trades, and this keeps people trading or buying on their platforms.

Got lucky with timing, and the fee was attractive to miners?

So, we can't go back below $5,000, right?

You wouldn't add more satoshi; you would allow satoshi to be subdivided, such as into mSats.

As far as I understand, GDAX covers the fees for you.  Check the transaction and you should see the fees that were paid.

If you sell for a bunch of money on January 1, you need to pay quarterly taxes, or you'll be hit with a fine for underpaying.  You don't need to do this with a day job because you're paying taxes with every paycheck.
@_date: 2017-12-30 18:59:35
Little different here.  Each coin is like a stock - some companies will do well and some won't.  This is more like buying Ford when you already hold Apple.  (Of course, with stocks, you have the benefit of good index funds, and we don't have that in this space really - you have to diversify manually.)
Edit:  To be clear, diversifying across asset classes is also a good idea, so I don't disagree with you there.  But adding different cryptocurrencies to your portfolio is also diversifying, same as having ten individual stocks is more diversified than having it all in one.

I wish we could get everything for USD.. buying A to transfer, exchanging to B to then exchange to C because of the trading pairs available has been SUPER ANNOYING.

They're the same company but different products.  GDAX authenticates through Coinbase.  GDAX will cover your fees for you, but Coinbase won't.

They're normal people and have a variety of family dynamics like everyone else.

If you're self employed, you should probably be filing quarterly taxes.

I dunno; this is fun.

@_date: 2017-12-30 21:29:31
You do have to file, though.  It can offset your taxes.
@_date: 2017-12-08 03:06:34
Yep.  You owe short-term capital gains on the difference between your cost basis (buy cost) and your sale price for the coins that you sold.
Example:  I buy 0.1 BTC for $100 in January.  I then sell 0.01 BTC when we hit $10,000, giving me $100.  I now owe taxes on my $100 sale minus my cost basis on the 0.01 BTC, which is $10.  So, I owe taxes on $90 in profit.
@_date: 2017-12-07 05:10:48
The gift giver has to file the taxes, not the receiver.  (Also wouldn't owe any money, just need to file in case they go over the tax-free lifetime limit.)

A few years ago, mBTC were called millies and uBTC were called mickies.  From what I'm seeing now, it's just mBTC and bits.  Bits is definitely easier.
