That's only what matters to you. Plenty of people will sacrifice one of those 3 to get superiority in the other two, and for good reason. I don't need it to be 100% decentralized if all I care about is a fast and free transaction. Each coin has a purpose, Bitcoin is the OG but plenty of alt coins serve a purpose and it would be woefully ignorant to say they "aren't real".

Roger Ver is a disgusting human but there if there is one thing he is right about it is that the fees for BTC are killing it slowly

They can't even reach a consensus on how to solve the scaling problem, driving a wedge into the community. I'm not arguing that they don't have the best devs - but they definitely don't have the best team right now. A team takes teamwork - and it seems there is none of that right now in the BTC development.

@_date: 2017-12-01 19:48:11
Their rationale is that they believe they can time the market and therefore aim to profit off of selling high and buying low 
@_date: 2017-12-01 19:33:47

@_date: 2017-12-01 20:28:03
Well... if I put in a bet for $10M that Bitcoin will reach $15k in 2 months, then you better believe I might put another $3-5M into bitcoin to help it reach that price

Noobs are freaking out about the price. Calm down people, **there's a lot of reasons for this mini-dip and none of them scare me at all**:
1) It's Monday. Nobody gets paid on Monday. Sportsbooks cash out their bitcoins on Mondays to pay the bettors who want to withdraw their wins from the weekend. 
2) It's too late to make bank purchases before the split on coinbase. This is a theory of mine - everyone was rushing to buy coins before the split on coinbase. But if you buy them today or later, you won't get them in time via bank transfer. So if you haven't bought before today, it makes sense to wait until after the split. 
3) We spend less than 2 days in the $6k-6.99k range. Literally just 2 days. That is by far the shortest we've ever spend in a K range. We will be spending more time in the $6k you can bet your money on it 
4) Uneducated beginners are clueless about the fork. Just read half of the posts on this subreddit today "Question about the fork.."  "I don't get the fork..." a bunch of people scared about what is going to happen selling off their coins
5) Beginners who got in on Friday at an ATH are panic selling because it has dropped below $7k and they think the gravy train is over. They aren't aware of the factors that long term hodlers understand - market manipulation, FUD, FOMO, Volatility - they just know that the $10k they invested is only $9k now and they aren't willing to see how far it will drop 
**When will the price go back up?** 
1) Wednesday &amp; Friday, when people get paid
2) 3 Days before the split - Last chance to purchase coins 
Chill, people. We will be dipping back and forth across $7k, probably dipping toward $6,500 tomorrow before pushing back up toward $7,500 this weekend. 
**IT'S ALL IN THE DIPS** 
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:33:08

I learned this one the hard way. Deposited 10,000 on 10/28 and it STILL hasn't shown up in GDAX. 
Price has gone from $5,800 to $7,400 
@_date: 2017-11-01 17:07:30
The deposit is listed there as pending, but no mention yet of the transfer to GDAX

@_date: 2017-11-29 19:36:07
That seems kinda mean 
@_date: 2017-11-07 20:23:58
Hell no. Withdraw before the fork? Why would anybody do that? You will buy in at a higher price in all likelihood.

You don't report until you take it off the exchange 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:36:26
If you purchase with a debit or credit card it is instant, bank transfers take 10 days (used to take 7 but there is a lot of purchases backlogged).
You will get the coins locked in at the price of purchase, but you won't have the coins in your account for 10 days. 
@_date: 2017-11-04 02:19:22
Really don't like this advice at all. The true believer in bitcoin would want to crush 2x so BTC cements its value and lifts off. The right way to do that would be to buy now, sell the 2x coins, and buy more BTC. If everybody does that then BTC skyrockets and 2x plummets. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:07:34
I'm buying $12,000...
I could have just bought straight away at $5700, but now it's $6500... that's almost $1,500 I've missed out on as a result of the decision to deposit funds instead of paying the fee. 
Personally I think it's going to go up at least $100/day for the next 15 days 
I really just wish I would have known how long the deposit would take. There should be a more reliable window than "2-4 days" when it looks to actually be more like 6-8 days 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:13:24
I just keep telling myself that in the long run that $1,000 difference won't mean much 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:21:10
Well yeah... it's a $10k sell wall not a $9999 sell wall ;) 
I do understand what you're saying though... if the key is just to see "10,000" on the ticker, then that would suffice. To retain the 10,000 ticker we will need to eat through the coins listed at 10k, which is why I listed those. No fun to play for touches... I'm playing for keeps! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:17:00
Yes, that is correct. You never have "100,000 worth of BTC" - remember that. You have "20 BTC" and you will receive "20 B2X" not "$100,000 B2X" 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:43:45

A bank transfer to GDAX isn't the same as a Bank Transfer Purchase on Coinbase
My GDAX transfer for $10k took 7 days, but a similair purchase through Coinbase took 10 days
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:01:47
Incorrect. If you are on an exchange like Coinbase you will be able to make independent transactions 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:08:54
Yeah I'll try to update every hour
@_date: 2017-11-01 15:56:46
I think from now on I will just be paying the fees instead... lost out on almost $1k of gains already!! But I know the price is in a steep climb because of the upcoming fork... I should have known better.

$10,000 sell wall is still at 1,400 coins.
That's down from 2,000 coins yesterday, but we still have a ways to go. I don't expect it to break 10K for 2-3 more days. 
@_date: 2017-11-01 16:24:12
Hoping I can buy this weekend! 
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:52:06
You buy 1 BTC before the fork, and you own 1 BTC
Fork occurs. 
You now own 1 BTC, and 1 B2X.
That's it.

Those are only the limit orders currently placed. Those are a bad indicator of movement because they can be quickly cancelled and they do not provide any info on market orders.

I would be surprised if it fell that far before the split, but I will get some too if it does. To me that is the floor before the split, but I wouldn't be shocked if we hold steady past 7k either. Nobody really knows!

It just means bitcoin cash had it developed into the tech, and B2X is going to rely on the Exchanges for replay protection. 
Anybody who thinks that selling one will cause you to sell the other is just spreading FUD

All 3 scenarios are terrible indicators of what you should do with your investment. The depth chart doesn’t include any info about market orders, and those will be the determining factor in the market price. 
@_date: 2017-11-07 17:00:04

@_date: 2017-11-07 17:15:44
I'm well informed and am holding plenty of BTC. You saying there is a fight for the real bitcoin are the one who needs to get informed. A lack of replay protection doesn't mean there is a fight for BTC, it just means that the exchanges will handle the replay protection which is probably a good thing anyway. Who do you trust more, every individual holding their BTC, or an FDIC insured institution? 
There is a lot of FUD spreading on this subreddit about the fork, and it's totally unnecessary.

Nano is a significant risk to the BTC P2P empire don't you think?
Mining is not sustainable. 1mb blocks are not scalable. Lightning network is a joke. Fees for transferring money go up as the network usage goes up.
Tell me how Nano doesn't beat BTC in every way for a P2P currency?
No mining necessary, no fees, scalable with hardware, and nearly instant tx.

Personal prediction is this:
Now - Fork : People suffering from severe FOMO bully the price up to $7,500 
Fork Occurs: B2X starts out worth around $750, BTC drops to around $6,000 
4 hours after fork - trading opens: Users sell B2X, re-buy additional BTC. 
B2X drops to $300
BTC Back to $7,000 
Fork - January 1st, 2018: BTC rises to $10,000

I'm not sure it will fall. I plan to immediately sell my 2x and spend the value buying more BTC. If everybody else does that, then BTC skyrockets after the fork. 
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:42:52
A threshold at which BTC are sold in large quantities, in this case ~$1,050,000 worth was sold upon the value reaching $4210. Typically this is done to enter a short position, believing the price will drop within coming hours or days, in order to re-buy the BTC at a lower price and re-enter the market with the same # of BTC, and some cash in hand. 
@_date: 2017-10-27 23:14:54
It's less likely that occurs on a stable exchange than if he were to try and manage the fork on his own
