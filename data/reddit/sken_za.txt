they already said that the most likely scenario is to socialize losses among btc holders and margin funders, so if you are not in that category you should be fine
@_date: 2016-08-09 23:48:40
because the ceo is busy finding investors to keep this multimillion dollar exchange a float. he does not have time to deal with butthurt ignorant peasants like you that lost 2.32432435 bitcoin in this ordeal

they dont have to pay you shit if they declare bankrupcty. besides you dont even know they are paying or not, you are going by an internet rumor
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:19:43
according to reality, where do you think the money is going to come to pay for the haircut genius? if the investors call bankruptcy they are protected and not forced to give you a nickel from their money to you. no matter how much they fucked up

as long as there is no way to liquidate the bfx coin for 1 usd, i considered that money lost. i dont have false hopes of seeing it back. but i have hopes to keep the rest, because unlike you i live in reality where i know that if this goes through legal means, i will see less, years later.
you still havent explained where are you going to get all your money if you sue them
@_date: 2016-08-06 05:32:08
the site has nothing to fucking do with the btc. they are two different things, can you stop the bs for a second and tell us what the hell is actually going on? ask your people how much time is going to take them to have the site up FOR REAL. give us the truth man
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:23:05
i was talking to people reading this post that lost btc, not just you. i have most of my funding on fiat thinking that is safer than btc since its on an actual bank account rather than some wallet, but if i lose that as well, so be it. i just want this to be solved as quickly as possible
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:57:19
you are partly to blame for trusting your money to them
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:52:56
what is going to happen to the usd accounts of your customers? will they be able to keep those funds?
@_date: 2016-08-05 03:18:46
hey zane great job you are doing so far. couple of questions tho. if i have a bunch of fiat usd in my margin trading account, will that fiat count as part of the socialized losses?
if i have an open short for say 20 btc, will it be deducted from my margin trade account fiat?
lastly, is the whole BFXcoin really a possibility? seems like a good idea tbh
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:14:19
your thinking is so naive, that is pathetic, you live in fantasy land if you think you will get a better deal if you involve police and courts. it will take many years, and it will be costly, and in the mean time you lost the trading opportunities during those years, and if you get any money back it will be on USD at btc prices = 604
funny how you trusted bitfinex with your money a day before the hack, but a day after now they are worse than satan. did someone bent your arm to give them your money? how delusional is for you to think that there were no risks for giving your money to complete strangers? wake up, get real man
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:25:33
where you in the chriss dunn group?
@_date: 2016-08-09 12:29:29
is bitfinex still accepting kyc forms. i submitted mine through the website is that service working?
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:23:51
the best solution is to give bitfinex some space to figure out a solution and not just jump and start suing. the day that cryptsy closed its  entire operation was the day the first law suit came in. did any of these people got their money back? Nope, the ceo moved to china and opened a new exchange there. Gox was forced to declare bankruptcy in the us because they were being sued as well. Did anything came out of that ligitation as of today? Nope, not a single cent, and the CEO is already free. If you try to do this by legal means you are fucked. this is bitcoin you knew this was a risky deal, now accept the consequences. i have a bunch of btc and a bunch of fiat, i know that at least 2/3rds of my btc are gone, and im ok with that. i accepted the risk, i knew that a hacker could fuck my shit up, or that the copany could just run away with all my money, i lost, now i want my access to my fiat and my left over btc and move on.
this is the wild west, you all proud yourselves to be in this position, people are going to fuck you up, but the rewards are also greater. fuck the haircut, fuck compensation. the people that lost btc should just take the hit, and move on. we are losing opportunities here for trading

is it possible to withdraw via tether?
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:27:24
Hacking is part of the risks of investing in bitcoin Dumbass, that's why is high risk, what's you think the price is reflecting?
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:50:50
if it being with 3 then bitfinex has your btc, if it begins with 1 then the hacker has them
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:23:58
if you decide to take this to the ground, do you honestly expect to see a cent before the end of the decade? nope you wont, at best you will probably get like 20-40% back, at 604 prices minus legal fees. In the meantime BTC will probably be at 4 digit USD valuation, and you will be left out because you are a baby that cant be reason with and decides to fuck everyone up because you cannot get your way
@_date: 2016-08-03 22:21:55
wallets are property of the owners, they are not assets of bfx. keep your filthy fingers away from my fiat
@_date: 2016-08-05 15:25:02
all btc holders including non btc hacked accounts and margin funders will be socialized. 
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:49:01
the only thing i found fishy about all of this is BFX quick response to absolve Bitgo from any responsibility. Also Bitgo made an announcement implying they are innocent and that they "did their job", which is retarded since their job is to protect their clients bitcoin, regardless of their implementations. I suspect that BitGo is much more guilty than what we think, but in order to contain the scandal to just BFX they probably arranged a deal ($$) with bfx to keep quiet about BitGo's culpability
@_date: 2016-08-09 14:22:40
legal team? for fucking 4k LOL? fucking kids these days watching too many lawyer dramas. yeah it sucks for you that they did this, but you wont do shit about it because 4k with a "legal team" will only get you an appointment to hear if your case is worth their time (which it isnt)
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:14:22
yeah once its my funds are set up free quickly by bitfinex i will, but i might not for idiots like you that want to call the cops and freeze my assets
@_date: 2016-08-06 14:34:35
that could be true, so what? are you going to sue them? no one has ever seen a single cent back if they take this route. the only times customers have seen their money back is when they work with the exchange. yeah this might be an inside job, it does not matter, you play the game, you lost, take your leftover coins lick your wounds and move to another exchange
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:32:11
we need an update or something man, people are getting impatient. you said something is happening today. are you going to change the story again?
@_date: 2016-08-08 16:42:49
are you guys considering using usdt so people can withdraw their fiat?
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:25:51
its unlikely that thats what happened
@_date: 2016-08-08 19:24:04


yes you are, why you think btc is considered high risk dumbass. the risk of exchanges getting hacked is priced in, wonder why btc went from 600 to 480 after the hack? btc is not in a vacuum. bitfinex is not fucking NYSE, or NASDAQ. no one forced you to send your btc to bitfinex, were you complaining when you were making big bucks on the long run 2 months ago and on the short last month? now that you are aware of the risk you took, embrace it and stop whining about it


there is no other exchange for americans were you can margin trade with liquidity except bfx, once they open they will take their money away, realize there is no other place for shorting, they will come back and start trading again
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:12:52
bitcoin theft in a multinational operation is not as legally well defined as rape, you are only going to raped even more with the legal fees. stop being a little coward and just accept the consequences of giving money to total strangers that will rape you over the internet, because that's what you did when you send your money to bitfinex
@_date: 2016-08-08 13:16:20
i want to see the parties caught but most importantly i want my money back, calling the fbi and say that bitfinex stole your money is going to do the opposite. wait at least until the smart people move their money out, then you can call whoever you please
@_date: 2016-08-05 13:24:33
because this is bitcoin no one really cares and those in power are probably glad this happened. Theres no evidence of a conspiracy so far, im open to it, but so far is mere speculation. someone was shorting at OKcoin, well the market look like it was about to pop, so there is no real mystery there, it could be connected but there is no evidence so far
@_date: 2016-08-08 18:53:17
that's what you say to anyone that disagrees with you?
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:18:42
as of today, and probably for the rest of the decade, there is no legal system in the planet that is going to sort this problem in a competent and timely manner. just like in the wild west property rights were poorly enforced due to a weak rule of law. all you can do is defend yourself. you accepted the risk when you give bitfinex your money. rewards are great in bfx but so are risks
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:13:45
What exactly do you expect to get out of this?  You won't get more than what you already got, that's a fact, it only goes down for you if you take legal action, you will only be fuxking everyone else that is not a moron and call the cops
@_date: 2016-08-08 07:37:10
Dude what are you talking about bitfinex is not fucking nasdaq, if you want safety go trade there, the reason why you are here is because profit is greater, and that's due to risk, if you shorted this hack you made a lot of money, that's the reality of this markets, if you got hacked you lost money. It's on our hands to not lose our minds for this and have irrational expectations from a law suit

enjoy not seeing a dime in 5 years (if lucky).
