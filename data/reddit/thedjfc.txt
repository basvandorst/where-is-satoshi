Yes. Selling bitcoin into Peso is a taxable event.

Because you might be able to send it to him through already existing channels. And that would save an on chain transaction.  If you only send 1 transaction then no, lightening isn't any better.

@_date: 2014-07-02 06:54:44
I'm 100% sure it's because of bitcoin.
They told me "The activity in the account doesn't match the profile intended for the account"
All I do with this account is pay student loans, pay taxes, and buy and sell bitcoin: lot's of bitcoin.

Obviously, as there is a decent sum of money involved, I will be offering cash bounties for information that helps me get my coins back.  "Throwaway43572" thinks this is a Mt. Gox address... I'm trying to verify that myself, but it definitely makes sense given the context.  If anybody is a lawyer, or even better somebody at Mt Gox, I will reward/retain you to help get these funds back.

Pure and simple.  100%.  That's not Fedspeak, and anybody who models for the Fed wouldn't be shocked by a finger in the air analysis that you pulled out of your ass.  You cannot predict the adoption rate of something as radical as bitcoin as you can with other technologies.  And no self-respecting Fed employee would claim to be able to do so.

I think it has everything to do with it.  Why else would they close my account?  The only thing suspicious is bitcoin money going in and out.
@_date: 2014-06-02 15:59:12
So we've proved that it's Mt. Gox.
Is there anybody around in the Mt. Gox tech department... anybody at all I can speak to?
Pls send the coins back.

@_date: 2014-03-10 17:12:27
The point is we shouldn't have to agree.  If you have a cartel for fee acceptance, then bitcoin will have a difficult time when even people like me (who aren't complete retards) accidentally pay a .00000001 fee instead of .0001.  Basically you should always have your transaction done, just at an annoyingly slow pace.  If a real cartel forms around block mining, some transactions just won't ever happen.  And that's a very very bad thing for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:56:17
I just asked Coinbase to do so.

I copied and pasted the wrong address.  I immediately realized what I did.  I posted on reddit here:
A kind Redditor proved to me that it was indeed a Mt. Gox address.
I retained a lawyer in Tokyo.
I reached out to Bobby Lee of BTC china who connected me to some people in the know.
My lawyers contacted the trustee of the fund.
Mark Karpeles is a good guy as well.
The court in Tokyo agreed that these are my coins and they were returned to me.  I gave the redditor a reward.  I made a donation to the BTC foundation.  And I now have legal fees to pay.

He's still involved as far as I know.  Not in control, but can relay messages around.  From what I could figure, he's a great guy who's a bit tormented by the current situation.  But overall I get the sense that he's not done, and we will be seeing him again.
Don't forget what Mt. Gox did for bitcoin as a whole.
Without Mt. Gox, there would be no bitcoin.

Hi.  That's me.
PM me and I'll get you the details of the lawyers I used in Tokyo.  You should be able to recover most of the coins.  Don't panic.  It will cost you a bit in legal fees, and I suggest some sort of goodwill donation on top of that, but touch wood we should get these back for you.  The lawyers/administrator of the bankruptcy went through all of this for me, so the trail is pretty much blazed.
Will be away for a bit for a few hours, but I'll get back to you.
I know EXACTLY how you feel.
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:04:58

I've copied and pasted my bitcoin address hundreds of times.  This time I got it wrong.  I'm very sorry that I did that.  I wish I hadn't.  Let this be a cautionary tale: be deadly sure who the address belongs to.  And for God's sake send a test transaction.
@_date: 2014-06-02 14:49:59
Did not.

Maybe unpopular opinion here but Bernanke handled that pretty well. The questioner doesn't really know what he's talking about. He's obtuse at best, conflating currency swaps to extension of credit.  It's not like the Fed just handed foreigners cash. They swapped USD with major world central banks. 
Because USD is the reserve currency of the world right now.  One day we will do the exact same thing but with BTC instead.
Bitcoin is great, but not because of this.

A year ago I had a mining operation with 9 GPUs chugging away (wouldn't do much these days) but my apartment came with free electricity.  Additionally it was always too cold during the winter and the bitcoin mining kept my flat nice and cosy.

This is Nasdaq OMX in Stockholm. JPM (as a broker) probably bought this Bitcoin fund on behalf of it's clients. Once something is listed on an exchange it's not very common for brokerages to discriminate what you can and cannot buy.

Lol. It's a PowerPoint.

Uh what?  Buying $10B will definitely move the price.

Bitcoins will trade for EXACTLY $6969 forever.  This is a verifiable and self-evident truth.  Last I checked They were below $100 per coin! Holy fucking shit that's a bargain for something that will settle down $6969!!!!

Stop thinking of your wealth in terms of USD. If the price goes up to 30k that just means you did a good trade before, when you locked in your BTC. 
When you sell your BTC, that's when you're buying into USD.  Flip your perspective upside down.

Dealt with this guy yesterday.  First transaction didn't go too smoothly (I guess the deals on his site don't apply to New York).  He seemed nice enough and did take care of the order, but it cost me a bit more BTC and time to get the deal done.

I agree except for the fact that some transactions take almost a day to confirm due to scalability issues.
