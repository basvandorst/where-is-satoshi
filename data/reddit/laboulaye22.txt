Someone has to trailblaze.
@_date: 2018-01-11 23:59:28
Lightning + time will do that for us.
@_date: 2018-01-09 14:22:05


Or because it's cheaper than paying per month.
@_date: 2018-01-23 22:01:44
Thanks, saved me the trouble of looking for the tweet!
@_date: 2018-01-31 00:56:47
Some exchanges have said they're waiting until the Core client had fully implemented Segwit support before making the switch. Once the full release is out, then that's further pressure on them to implement it.

Did the same a few weeks ago but 11 sat/byte. Wonder when it’ll confirm.

Wow. Their dishonesty is truly mind boggling.
@_date: 2018-01-31 15:28:28
Just wait. ETH will fall back below 1K again. Before it goes back up, of course. I'm thinking around $700-800ish range.
@_date: 2018-01-25 17:35:11
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:33:19
I just did the same thing!
@_date: 2018-01-30 19:11:43
Bloomberg reporting on two month old ~~already reported~~ news. They've updated the article, too. Wow.
@_date: 2018-01-16 14:50:57
Can confirm.
@_date: 2018-01-30 04:38:34
20/28. Better than I thought considering all the dates.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:36:30


Understood. Will send boomer nudes.
@_date: 2018-01-12 18:27:46
Kind of canned response but we'll see. They should really put out a comprehensive statement on this shit not just "we're working on it!" Whenever they do address it at more length they come off as very defensive.
They should be jumping over giraffes to let their users know they've heard their concerns and are working to fix things. Not these curt one sentence non-responses. They haven't even done something as simple and basic as admitting that people are unhappy with their service! They just continue to "address" the criticism indirectly instead of head-on.
@_date: 2018-01-17 15:08:00
I know I get my Bitcoin news from the bank!
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:37:43
Where are you seeing this?
@_date: 2018-01-17 20:44:11
What did I just watch...
@_date: 2018-01-16 02:14:33
Jurassic Park.
@_date: 2018-01-05 18:54:27
What does UTXO mismanagement actually mean? From what I understand, they have a bunch of bitcoin they can't use because the fees would bleed them. Is that correct? I'm just not exactly sure what is meant when people say they didn't manage their UTXO set properly. Does it have anything to do with batching payments?
@_date: 2018-01-28 20:41:32
Keep a backup wallet with a small amount of coins and then transfer those coins instead of your main stash. And don't advertise how much bitcoin you have.
@_date: 2018-01-24 21:50:35
@_date: 2018-01-27 03:13:06
Yeah, just pointing out that it *did* go from an ATH 20K to 9K. So you could at one point relatively recently (in non-crypto time) get 9K bitcoin.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:47:14
I agree a better solution needs to be implemented. I'm just saying in the meantime there is something we can do to clean up our dust.

I don't understand how anybody takes this guy seriously. I first heard of him when I was in high school without any knowledge of stocks or financial markets or any of that shit...and I heard him talk for a couple minutes and knew not to take him seriously.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:36:05
Once Lightning is fully deployed on mainnet, if you want to run a Lightning node, will that be separate from my current full node? Am I going to have run a full node and a Lightning node?
@_date: 2018-01-31 03:53:15
Yup, like I said, I probably just misread the title when I Googled it real quick.
@_date: 2018-01-25 20:35:47
Only one future expired so far. That's not a pattern.
@_date: 2018-01-30 22:26:14
Before the article came out (when it was just that original tweet) I Googled it and thought I saw something from back in December mentioning it. So, I thought it was old news at first. Obviously now I can't find it because every link on Google is of today's news. I only looked quickly so I probably mistook it for a different article.
@_date: 2018-01-25 13:08:35
My 11 sat/byte donation to Andreas just confirmed, too!! 
@_date: 2018-01-30 23:49:34
I didn't click on the link. Just looked at the headline/date on Google.
@_date: 2018-01-17 13:16:55
@_date: 2018-01-28 23:47:12
Is there a source for this? I looked in the show notes for the video but it's not there and I can't find anything about it...
Edit: Never mind, found it: 
@_date: 2018-01-23 19:13:52
Which has been strongly discouraged. Lightning devs would prefer everyone stay on testnet for now as people have already lost funds.
@_date: 2018-01-16 22:10:14
Double bourbon neat. Make that two.
@_date: 2018-01-11 13:18:28
You can use it to pay for fees on Binance.
@_date: 2018-01-27 02:40:57
It did drop to 9.2K on GDAX for a short time when the CBOE futures expired.
@_date: 2018-01-24 16:34:20
Climbing shoes! Doing it right.
@_date: 2018-01-13 23:50:56
Ah, OK. That's what I figured but just wasn't 100%. Thanks!
@_date: 2018-01-18 13:37:12
Think we've already been living that nightmare for a while now...
@_date: 2018-01-13 14:12:54
The post explains it pretty well, what don't you get?
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:19:20
Nobody is saying otherwise.
@_date: 2017-12-04 23:24:38


In the spirit of this statement care to send some coin my broke ass way? No? Darn... :)

I was verified about a week ago. It only took 3 days for me.

I've wanted to get a dog forever. I know what I'm doing with my bitcoin earnings when I cash out!

Love your reply. Probably didn't do anything to calm her worries!
@_date: 2017-12-24 21:58:30


They changed it back to $5 minimum, I think, but said they will continue to "monitor the network."
@_date: 2017-12-13 02:06:07


Is there some place I can learn more about the specifics of such limitations?
@_date: 2017-12-12 16:56:56
What is the argument that he's making? That Bitcoin doesn't work as a currency because people will hold it as a store of value instead? And that makes BCash a better candidate to be used as a currency?
Sorry if that's obvious but while I've been aware of Bitcoin for ages, I've never really looked into the tech and stuff behind it or other cryptocurrencies.
@_date: 2017-12-15 22:35:21
I wasn't being sarcastic.
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:23:23
On the surface, that appears to be a positive thing, though? Will Lightning Network fix that issue and therefore BCash wouldn't have that benefit over BTC?
@_date: 2017-12-26 13:56:15
I think there's a line to dance between ignoring them and addressing their bullshit so others don't fall for it.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:22:27
I understand completely. I can't wait for all this mess to get sorted out.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:58
10 800 and sitting back.
@_date: 2017-12-24 22:13:33


Edit: I see you edited your post so you must have seen it!
@_date: 2017-12-12 18:50:43
Yeah, it'll be interesting to see going forward how this all shakes out. Exciting time in the world, exciting time.

Some of us are able to tell the difference between a serious tweet and a meme/joke tweet ;)

It was a pleasurable experience watching all those liquidations come in last night. Anybody shorting at 10.8K might have some success, though.
@_date: 2018-02-08 17:54:19
Thanks, will check it out!!
@_date: 2018-02-09 12:19:41
Yup. I'm as skeptical of Coinbase's motivations as the rest but I think all exchanges need to be given some slack. They were NOT prepared for the insane volume increase. Some of them handled it better than others, for sure, and did Coinbase probably try to push an anti-bitcoin agenda? Yeah, probably. But guess what? They're implementing Segwit and Roger Ver is on InfoWars shilling BCash instead of CNBC. One more battle won by BTC.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:20:41
Like I said, that remains to be seen. It's not my preference, for sure. But I was just wondering what you meant specifically by the Valeant comparison, which, other than one company (if you want to say Goldman is a competitor to Poloniex, OK) buying another company, it's not the best comparison. But whatever, I agree that it's a less than desirable situation. Although you could say that now Goldman has a financial incentive to see crypto thrive. 
@_date: 2018-03-04 14:24:45
Regarding your second criticism, I get you, but I think it's obvious hyperbole to highlight the crazy crypto volatility. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 09:48:13
You missed the pertinent part of his comment.


Which requires Lightning.
@_date: 2018-03-29 12:05:16
I'd say you'll do decent if you just hold this position. I just bought now, too. I plan on selling around 10K though and buying back around 5.5K.
@_date: 2018-02-26 14:44:29
Wait, what does this have to do with Valeant?
@_date: 2018-02-02 13:22:49
Well said, my man. Bitcoin is a teacher of harsh lessons. On the way down **and** on the way up.

Everyone's an allegedly something or other now.

Pretty sure they have a cold storage wallet, too. Somebody posted it in the comments to the Twitter exchange between McAfee and Binance.
@_date: 2018-02-10 22:48:47
Maybe he will hold our private keys for us. You know, to keep them safe?
@_date: 2018-02-01 11:14:16
I don't support Bcash but I agree with his perspective. This is good news but it's nothing to get too worked up over...yet. The title of the post is definitely a little hyperbolic..."goes all in" lol. It just says there's growing demand for mining chips. 
@_date: 2018-02-08 10:51:21
Could=will or are.
@_date: 2018-02-26 15:12:16
Eh, a company bought another company. I'm not sure what comparison you're trying to make. Whether this is good or bad remains to be seen but there's nothing inherently insidious about it
@_date: 2018-02-27 00:52:04
What the fuck.
@_date: 2018-02-15 17:12:22
You're literally saying this in every fucking thread and it's not even relevant to the discussions.
@_date: 2018-02-09 13:05:29
Actually, if you believe one conspiracy theory you're more likely to believe in others. Which I'm sure is why Roger went that direction in the interview. He's not stupid, he knows the demographic that watches Alex Jones.

I'm sure they knew two weeks out, a week out. A lot of work goes into launching a new coin and they've done it before so I'm sure they had a timeline.

It's interesting that I just watched a presentation by Tom Lee who also said that 1 BTC would be worth $10 million.

IDK man a lot of the good traders on Twitter were all bullish when we were at 6500 (myself included, though I'm definitely not an expert).
Tone Vays and Richard Heart are not the best people to listen to, IMO, though.
@_date: 2018-04-03 12:49:48
Yeah, they raised the fees for less than 100BTC and 1000 ETH trades. It's really, really bad. Better to switch exchanges if you can.
@_date: 2018-04-16 20:30:14


This. Are there those who intentionally fuck people over and abuse the system purposefully for gain at the expensive of the rest of us? Yeah. But most people legitimately think they're doing the right thing and are trying to make the world a better place.
