You are correct long term, but if you look 50 years back most of the companies are gone also.
Anyways walmart is spending a ton of cash on foreign stores all around the world, and has no plans to stop buying them up.
It bought massmart in africa recently, and is still expanding in china. As long as it continues to open in new markets it's going to be fine for a long while.

One other issue with amazon is it can't compete with wal-mart in the food department. The costs of shipping food ups/usps etc are just far too high. Wal-Mart is also investing in a new green fleet of shipping trucks to reduce costs of shipping which will only help further dominate the food market.

You should provide proof of such things. No community should tolerate any type of blackmail scheme by any person.
