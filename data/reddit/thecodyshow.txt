once a US exchange is up and running with proper deposit methods, you will see it start pouring in I bet

i think if this issue gets sorted out prices will go back over 800

bank wire to the exchanges is 1 day or 2 days. why cant that be good enough? Honestly curious. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:48:47
potentially yes but those other exchanges were created years after gox with proper coding and staff. It is much less likely.

fair enough. you are right that this is one of the best uses in bitcoin reddit to mention dogecoin. and I looked at the OP history and he isnt some doge pumper. It just seems every time i come on this reddit someone is posting about how awesome doge is and then i look up the price and it is dropping in comparison to bitcoin.

has anyone bought vogogo stock? It seems like its going up in price at a pace similar to what iv seen in the past on havlock but this time its through an actual stock market (toronto stock exchange)

is this legit or is it just richard shermans site?

are you verified? I say go with coins. lets say you get 6.5 coins. If you end up being able to withdrawal the coins that is $3737 right off the bat. 
You are as likely to lose it all leaving it as cash as you are in coins so may as well have a chance for it to be worth much more if the btc withdrawals work.
Also Mt. Gox hasnt done withdrawals of cash for months. the coin issue has only been a week.

someone coming into the shop and saying the atm is over priced and undercutting their business is not the same as competition. Go rent a space and get a money transmitter license and then see if you can offer way lower prices... 
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:40:19
its so stupid i say if this matters then you shouldnt buy bitcoin lol. you should go to school and learn about how price is irrelevant for something that can be sold in fractions. its about %gains and thats all that matters if you are using it as an investment
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:22:19
i think the market is over it and gox wont have much effect on the price of bitcoin in the future.

its probably to do with how those 2 day passes automatically convert to a 30 day subscription if not cancelled which is not possible with bitcoin
@_date: 2014-04-08 18:11:14
i would just use an atm to start or localbitcoins.com. Just meet in a public place and make sure the coins are in your wallet before giving the cash over.

without those functions you cannot day trade properly especially without having a massive amount of coins that can actually move the price.
Risk is there forsure but I only keep around 15 coins on the site and as I earn money I funnel it out to my paper wallets. I just use the 15 coins as collateral so I can margin.
It has been working out great with my most recent strategy. I sort of picture 400 as a low and I only margin buy and I keep the margin 1:1 so not dealing with massive loss or gain potential.
I only margin buy because I dont want to send more of my own money and I dont trust myself to sell properly because it can jump so randomly and then i instantly think im missing the boat and buy back at a loss.
I margin buy when it dips hard so like when it goes from 480 - 440 quickly, i then set a margin buy at like 435 so it randomly hits but then the price is back up to 440 quickly. at the same time i set the margin buy i put a stop around 20-30 bucks per coin less so I know exactly what i am risking to lose. Around 400 its easy to put your stop just under so it doesnt randomly hit as moving below $400 requires some massive sells. 
Once i have the stop set and the margin buy has filled I set a limit sell at a profit that I believe can be attained "easily" meaning if there is low volatility i set it around 10$ per coin about what i bought at so I know its chance of filling is very high. When more volatile i try to snag the sell around 20-30$ above what i bought for. 
I never work with selling my own coins and keep my daily income goal between $100-$500 so i dont get greedy. Since i started this im up $2700 in the last week and a bit with 0 trades happening at a loss out of around 13-15 total trades in this time frame
1 other thing. If im actually at my computer and actively trading, i set a trailing stop instead of a limit sell so i can hopefully cash in on more gains. this requires price to go up by like $20 instead of 10$ so i set a 10$ trailing stop and let it ride. I hope they impliment it so I can set a trailing stop based on a limit sell.. aka buy at 430 and set it so that if it hits 450 a trailing stop of $10 kicks in. this would be AMAZING. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:41:01
have you never seen a site like this one? 
If you hold your mouse over the green line near the bottom it shows that around 2 mill of coins sold would drop the price below 700. 25 million would drop price mUUUUCH lower.
A private auction is just them agreeing to a price and all coins going for the same price....
@_date: 2014-01-29 17:57:17
brilliant if you have paid for a space and have your own business. Standing infront of a machine that was bought for $20,000 and trying to stop it from getting business is just straight up slimy.

do you think their fee will be 5% when there is atms on every corner and bitcoin is used by everyone.. god so many cheap f*cks on reddit who have no idea how business works and dont ever think from a business perspective.

well if you were day trading you could have made 5-10% on your money today.

Im fairly sure its insider trading. There was a 5000 bitcoin buy wall at $110 yesterday on gox and as it was getting eatin up there was a very similar amount of bitcoins sold on bitstamp and other exchanges.

try running a business in an industry that is growing this fast. they bought 5 atms months ago and always said the last 4 were being delivered to them early 2014. THey planned on setting them all up in canada but then other companies were setting up in canada and the UK went full pro bitcoin so they changed their business strategy. How is that being shady? that is adapting to change. 
they didnt bash bitstamp they came on here to say their bitstamp trades were frozen so they couldnt process trades. that is telling the truth about why issues were happening. It wasnt the atm that was malfunctioning. 
Show me them bashing robocoin that is a straight up lie. 
@_date: 2014-05-23 17:51:10
good luck not buying more hahah. its a slippery slope. i cant stop 
@_date: 2014-02-11 22:06:22

really good question. dont you need to pay a miner fee or anything for these transactions, and is that satoshi returned to the original address when it isnt confirmed for long enough?

YOu are the moron if you can be so sure this isn't happening that you are willing to be this rude. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 23:32:48
well i bought at 70 per coin but i sold half at 520 yesterday hoping for a drop in price, if it doesnt work out I will obviously buy back because I believe in bitcoin long term but I do honestly believe that price could drop more in the coming days. 
I also realize it could shoot up but that sort of goes against all the information given to us including the steady decline in prices. I am by no means cashing out for good but Iv had lots of chances to sell and buy back in cheaper that I never bothered to try so this time I am giving it a shot with some of my stash
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:27:33
personally i think if you have 100 bitcoin or more you are set. it either will make you a millionaire in the next couple years or you will lose all of it or most of it but still not be suicidal lol.
That is the sweet spot for me that I am working towards. 
@_date: 2014-05-20 23:16:22

i think the "drop" in price that evryone is saying is going to happen on the 31st has already been priced into current market price for weeks. 
I really dont think there will be a big drop or a drop at all. If there is a drop it will be short term.

i have lost amount of money that i wouldnt have dreamed of even having before i got into bitcoin but I stay positive because honestly I think once we get some more regulation and exchanges etc, the next bitcoin bubble will blow $1200 out of the water. 
I dont agree with just watching your stash go down but if you can handle it in real life it may be worth doing at this point. 
It is always this point where everyone is so worried and are selling that things start to turn around. 
Just remmeber a lot of the price crashing is people with massive stashes selling to buy in lower, not just selling to get out of the bitcoin market.

doesnt mean what I said isnt correct. 
@_date: 2014-04-15 23:23:41
iv seen hundreds of posts on reddit about people petitioning amazon or emailing customer service etc so they have heard of it a ton but mostly from people wanting to buy with bitcoin i guess. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 17:02:38
too good
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:01:33
i think a lot of people were thinking the same and that is why price has been dropping

it was 9am not 10am sorry. i forgot where i got that time difference from and turns out it was japan or something.
Are you pointing out that I was an hour off? because my point is still relevant for 9am vs 10am
@_date: 2014-03-20 23:34:38
i dont know if there is an unconfirmed transaction when using coin base because its not just going from 1 address to the other. I would just wait an hour or so.

tiny buys and a good price, dont sweat it, it will be ok. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:43:44
I disagree and the link you just sent me has this in it 
"Wells Fargo's anti-money laundering chief, Jim Richards, has launched a group to examine how the bank might safely offer Bitcoin-related services or banking arrangements to virtual currency entrepreneurs, the Financial Times said, quoting people familiar with the matter."
@_date: 2014-02-28 00:21:37
i voted and cant beleive how many people answered it should be banned. straight up jealousy and ignorant. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 21:36:26
i think that price will rise very rapidly on all exchanges and then what you are talking about will happen for a lot of the coins but it would most likely not bring the price below what it was before the announcement. I actually think overall price will go up because everyone worried about the gox issue can now get out of there and get back to bitcoining. 
@_date: 2014-03-12 19:57:40
I have tried to raise as much money as possible each year for a bursary for the high school Dan Scoular went to. He was a military member who was killed in a car accident on duty. 
Each year I find I have to pretty much harass people to donate because of how much personal information and work it takes to donate. I have linked the page where I have collected donations but it has been a tough go. If you check the link you will see the full story. 
Do you think setting up a website that can accept bitcoin would work? Are there fundraising sites that use bitcoin that I can post a bitcoin address to donate to? This website gofundme.com was very useful but maybe there is a bitcoin version? 
Many of my friends and family are starting to get into bitcoin so this would be amazing! 
The bitcoin address I use is 1J9tv8NVsYPP2bmr55V245F7u6VKrC8VuV but only a couple friends have donated since I have to ask them directly and send my bitcoin address and walk them through the process.

this is great actually. the further we penetrate the states with bitcoin options the further we get to the moon...
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:01:51
this date has already been taken into consideration with current market prices. if they announced they are shutting things down on the 31st the day of then you could expect a big crash.

@_date: 2014-02-24 20:41:53
pretty sure it was twitter that was at fault! lol.
Personally I think it may be a way of rebranding. maybe the next news we get from gox will be that someone is buying them out. 
@_date: 2014-04-17 22:25:04

it said the cold storage was wiped out because of an error in the hot wallet..
thats physically not possible, wtf are they talking about. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:02:50
you dont spread the risk if its all digital currency lol. you just set yourself up for even larger losses when prices are going down. dogecoin vs BTC had dropped by 70% in the last 48 days so your diversification would have lost you WAY more than if you just bought bitcoin :S. The portion you put into dogecoin would be down 70% more than what your bitcoin portion is down. 
If you want to diversify, dont just think digital currencies! 
@_date: 2014-01-16 23:28:13
i have a feeling they will go privately rather than crashing exchanges so they get the most money possible. i dont see why they dont just keep the things though.
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:08:21
Ok i see where you are going with this. Bitcoin being stable and US dollar dropping would be a massive reason so it sort of pushes are reasons out of the picture but aside from that Id say based on my personal favourites:
1) instant international transfer of money for free basically
2) the "i have money on me all the time" aspect.. being able to pay back a friend for a debt with the tap of a phone etc.
3) not worrying about banking hours to get money etc.
4) not having to give personal info online for payments as well as not worrying that you forgot you set up a subscription and havign them auto charge you
5) definitely merchants pushing bitcoin for discounted prices etc. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 20:18:26

btc china will announce their accounts are closed sometime between now and the 15th im sure
@_date: 2014-02-04 21:34:02
it doesnt work that way with the cult mentality of other coins. they literally get the entire reddit over to bitcoin to make sure their posts stay on the front page.

you sure about that? this one is different. half as many coins allowed per trade and also allows people to sell not just buy. you dont need to be accredited either.

they arent worth anything anymore didnt you get the memo today! :P
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:53:33
I just think that they would account for the lost coins based on trades and holdings prior to them finding the glitch. Unless they are pulling a full out scam I think that they would stop people from having coins stolen for trades done after the glitch was found. I could be wrong but I could be right lol. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 02:52:53

this is unreal!!!
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:48:10
quite the opposite I would say. Think of all the large institutional money that will flow into bitcoin now that they have set guidelines. Its annoying for the small timers dealing with day to day bitcoin purchases but for the value of bitcoin this will help prices go up. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 21:41:14
you would be surprised how many people have got androids because of bit coin. i will be buying android as soon as my contract is up and iv been iphone since they came out. 
Its not just the bitcoin enthusiasts they lose its all of the people who listen to bitcoin enthusiasts advice. 
im sure it would ammounts to 10s of thousands of lost iphone sales. 
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:30:27
cool that is great new! 
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:36:09
i think its great timing, i have a fair amount of coins and choose to buy low rather then sell on the drops trying to buy lower. 
maybe not the best way to do things but atleast i never take losses. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:31:39
why are you so dumb? I was making a point that it is only easy to buy things with checking cards and gift cards because you are in america. If you live in another country where you cant get a credit card this still allows you to purchase things with bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 18:34:46
to me i think btc is easier

r u serious or joking i cant tell?
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:37:21
I dont disagree but that could have been the excuse they could have justified it with in their heads. I would like to know if non localbitcoin related accounts are having the same issue. 
EDIT: I know you said they probably didnt know it was localbitcoins but they still new it was bitcoin related without you being an exchange or other type of business.

how old are you and do you have any trading experience lol?
that logic is completely out to lunch. there is no possible way a high volume trader could buy bit coins, sell them at a profit and cause me to lose money if I am just holding my bitcoins and not trading.
I would LOVE to see you try to explain how that could work.
@_date: 2014-02-27 18:59:41

without a doubt he does 
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:02:40
well your post sort of explains why they would switch given that both are equally easy to use. If US dollar value is dropping it would make more sense to use bitcoins because they would not be following the same pattern 
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:20:55
What was the method of deposit you were taking from US customers? Wire transfers? 
@_date: 2014-05-21 21:53:25
i dont know about you guys but to me it looks like bitcoin is in full snowball mode and it cannot be stopped. I am going back to my thinking that prices will easily be over $1000 by the end of 2014. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:50:38

running a fractional reserve exchange is still only possible with atleast some bitcoin. I dont think there was any doubt that they still had SOME coin left.

that just wont happen either. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:33:27
like I said, doge fans just do anything they can to mention it. Why not just leaving out the comparison to doge. The same argument can be made using litecoins or any other coin or just speaking specifically about using fractions of the coin without having to compare to another coin. THis is just an observation of mine from being on here since dogecoin was created. 
@_date: 2014-01-22 00:47:07
they see that someone is claiming amazon will accept bitcoin so they use the size of company and people they know to contact amazon and see if this is true or false. 
@_date: 2014-03-19 18:11:49

@_date: 2014-03-28 17:12:02
I just messaged the owner of the bitcoin related company monetas who is set up in Switzerland to see if he has any advice, Im sure he knows the best ways to do that. Sounds like bitcoin could be the best way to do things for sure
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:41:23
why do people keep talking about dogecoin like its so popular. i swear its a bunch of internet forum goers who own it and really noone else. They mention doge as many times as possible because they are scared if they dont it will disappear. Maybe its because the price keeps dropping?

its not the money its that he can test it out to see how a purchase would work. Even 5 bitcoins from a money perspective is useless to him. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:33:48
pretty sure its just to inflate price so someone can sell the coins that they bought yesterday for around $400 a piece. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 19:41:16
you are very uninformed for someone who trolls the bitcoin reddit. plain dumb, helicopter dumb, just dumb. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:47:25
This is what i think too. we got ahead of ourselves so as axtual addoption happens we are catching up. I absolutely expect us to break 1000 within 2 months though with a couple more big names accepting bitcoin. also when overstock and tiger direct start shipping internationally it will get people riled up. 
also, most people who dont have coins have been holding off buying some because everyone says its over priced etc and they arent just going to hop on board because 1 or 2 retailers accept it. THey will start buying when its just a normal thing to do and that will definitely push prices up. 
@_date: 2014-05-16 17:35:09
Great responses thanks guys! 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:12:10
some places? its only mt gox that is low because you cant withdraw coins or cash from there so it basically doesnt really exist. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:08:45

@_date: 2014-03-12 22:23:05
thank you for explaining. I definitely see the difference between the discussion quality here vs bitcointalk. Sometimes on reddit you really need to spend time to sift through the junk to get to real conversations. 
That being said, reddit does have some great discussion so not bashing it. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 22:15:59
buying at 400 isntead of 550 is a huge deal but you are right, 530 or 580, if you are going long term just make the purchase. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 22:56:49
if walstreet put 5 billion into bitcoin then prices would almost double which would cause bitcoin enthusiasts to keep buying more and then any onlooker who sees the gains happening will also jump in and then you get the snowball effect. 
also, china only got us to 1100 because the banned bitcoin or spread enough BS that people thought it was banned and ended up selling. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:56:14
why does everyone complain about how /bitcoin needs to be nice? 
We all come on here to read about bitcoin for many different reasons and it gets annoying to see 50 of the same questions, or 50 of the same article because everyone wants upvotes. 
This isnt preschool we dont all have to hold hands. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 03:18:42
Is this a new link?
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:01:49
the 2 answers so far are perfect. merchant adoption and user adoption are completely different. Price had already factored lots of merchant addoption so now that it has actually happened it is actually more likely to lower price as bitcoin holders unload a bit of their stash to buy cool stuff from these new merchants.
Bitcoiners are more likely to spend their coin much faster than new people buying bitcoin because these merchants now accept bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:26:49
and once you sign up to one of the sites i recommended you will see how easy it is to day trade. you just sell and buy as you see fit and hopefully earn a profit. 
today for instance i woke up early, saw the news about the ceo of bitinstant so i sold a bunch of coins because i knew price would drop. sold at 809 rebought at 740. almost 10% profit! 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:19:00
I truly believe in the saying "sell on the rumour, buy on the news" we all know what china has done now and we all know mt. gox fucked up. its just a matter of time before we start a new phase of prices going up. Im not saying we are definitely at the bottom but I have a strong feeling we close! 
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:59:22
i agree but this is only a concern short term. merchant adoption = bitcoin going mainstream which will lead to people and media getting over the fraud and theft and ponzi scheme crap. 
Also merchant adoption will lead to more exchanges and payment processors and eventually people like google and paypal etc incorporating bitcoin. Once it is extremely easy and safe to buy bitcoin that is when we will see huge user adoption. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 00:43:49
id say when bitstamp announces they are back in action. Or mt gox has a real update. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 22:37:35
why do people keep reporting on this. THe news has literally been "coming soon" for a year. How is that news?

Hi Nathan,
When i want to send coins is there anywhere on facebook I can click or do I need to have your webpage bookmarked separately to go to when i want to send coins?
@_date: 2014-01-24 20:58:50
because you cant transfer US$$ out so people have to buy coins so they can transfer them to another exchange in order to sell them which raises the BTC price. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 20:29:09
it said 88,000 coins 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:42:53
i glanced at that article, did it say they actually just let it sit there or is it just some stupid reporter saying those could be the losses based on an old statement of how much they owned? 
THey easily could have been day trading between now and then to minimize losses. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 22:54:33
if bitcoin becomes a major method of money transfer the value will still be much higher than it is now even if it never reaches currency status. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 20:12:43
it disappeared,. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 22:57:04
you cant be so sure about that tulipcoins. i just dont think shorting bitcoin right now is a safe bet especially for someone brand new to trading who most likely doesnt have a ton of coin to begin with. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 20:50:25

oh there will be another boom forsure in my opinion. within a month or 2. how prices are going right now is awfully similar to when it sat at 125 ish for a long time and then went heywire. 
I think the next boom will be banks and wallstreet etc buying into bitcoin
@_date: 2014-03-26 18:18:38
Im starting to find it hard to conceive a way that bitcoin will fail long term. So much money and talent flowing into bitcoin every day.

very proud
@_date: 2014-01-15 21:20:39
i disagree 100%. We want more merchants to start accepting bitcoin and the incentive for them is that they are saving on fees. If we force them to pass us on right away it will slow adoption. 
As a consumer with bitcoin hoping for savings just be happy that more merchants accept bitcoin because it will help increase the price of bitcoin and therefore earn you profit. 
Once the market has been saturated and a large percentage of companies accept bitcoin it will be time to push for the savings to be passed onto the consumers. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:06:01
bought at .7 and sold at 4.7 just like you guessed lol (a few sold at 4.9 but id say 4.7 was my average). absolutely insane and it took my tiny  investment and turned it into the real deal. a lot of fun but really just lucky to be into bitcoin at the time and too greedy to just let the price go up. 
Edit: holy crap I just realized who wrote that!! lol bbbbbubble! I bought those asicshares because of something you posted! Thanks. I think I actually messaged you a few times about asic related questions. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:08:13

@_date: 2014-04-09 20:13:11
what sort of ignorant question is that? Im not saying it guarantee will. they asked me to speculate on price. a regulated US exchange that aparently is going to be insured will definitely attract investors, especially wallstreet types. Id be 100000% surprised if second market launches and it doesnt help price go up.

such a nice car! wow. but.. 225,000? i dont really have much knowledge regarding pricing high end vehicles but that seems in the price range of some ridiculously nice cars. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 00:43:37
you probably started reading halfway through an arguement between me and that other guy. if you read earlier messages you will see the connection i was making :)
@_date: 2014-02-13 19:03:48
what are you talking about? 
@_date: 2014-04-25 20:10:42
lol thx for what?
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:56:27
id say its mostly bitcoiners buying back in because they saw an uptrend. To break 700 we will need some new money moving into bitcoin. It will happen and I wouldn't be surprised if we see prices head up more this weekend. 
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:33:56
LOL. do you even know how margin buying works? Iv made a ton margin buying ever since bitcoin started crashing.
I have a lot of coins myself but want to keep them and not panic sell. However, i dont just want to sit there losing money so instead I margin buy during dips and then close the margin and take the US$ profit. For instance if I sold right now at 445 I just made a $220 profit in $US on the margin buy I did an hour ago...
Im sure you dont know how a stop works either do you? I set a stop after I bought at 434 so it auto sells at 414 so my max possible loss in US$ is $400. the biggest risk is being greedy. do I take $220 right now or do I wait for it to go up a bit more and close the margin with higher gains.  This margin buy strategy has worked 12 times in a row as of late.
@_date: 2014-01-29 18:37:28
Umm if you owned a business and someone walked through the front door and started selling the same product while saying yours is trash and over priced you would be ok with that? 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:57:16
i agree but it seems to me like they dont want to grow faster than they are capable of and seem to be focusing on good customer service for current clients rather than marketing themselves on these forums to get more customers. 
Just my observation but I agree a formal post on here would be helpful.

@_date: 2014-04-07 20:03:00
which is a great thing. unless there was a massive advantage it just dilutes the purpose of bitcoin. Plus if some magic feature was invented they should just update bitcoin to include it. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:19:33

cant the developers make it so that any transaction of less than a certain size dont show up in our wallets? Especially ones that are not paying miner fees.
There must be a filter of some sort that the devs or wallet software companies can do?

@_date: 2014-01-20 22:06:41
there is no incentive for them to destroy bitcoin. people would learn about the double spend right away and it would crash bitcoin. there is more insentive for them to keep things going as they are.

if they hop on board and you already own bitcoin, you will win from this happening.

@_date: 2014-01-28 00:19:42
buy or hold. 
if there were news about someone using us dollars for crime it would not effect the price of us dollars. Bitcoin traders use any negative news to start a panic sell so they can sell coins and buy them back cheaper. dont give your money away to them! 
@_date: 2014-04-11 20:49:33
so many websites today trying to pump up the price. its gone up but doesnt mean something or another will make it drop again before the 15th. 
China still has btcchina in their back pocket for shitty news. They will most likely announce they have had their bank accounts closed as well.
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:26:02
it shouldnt do too much I think short term. but them doing this is working towards a landscape where large institutional investors feel comfortable investing in bitcoin which will surely make the price go up. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 17:44:56
this is great to hear. I use bitfinex every day so glad to know atleast for now they can be trusted. They should do these audits once every 3 months at least.

it doesnt destroy it as an investment. It is a great way to transfer money. I think the IRS ruling will change after some discussion but in the meantime its definitely great as an investment.

hitting new targetmarket and getting publicity for the addition of btc options. then they are just sitting there ahead of the curve so when everyone is accepting bitcoin they already have been for a long time. 
Thats a pretty good reason and I would hope google would think about these benefits.

@_date: 2014-04-01 21:40:17
you are about to have a ton of people who dissagree with your message and I agree with them. 
It is completely unsafe if you are a derelict. Soon there will be insured holders of bitcoin for people too useless to store the coins themselves.
I think that digital currency will always have the risk of theft when storing yourself as basically you only get robbed if you do it wrong and that is the reason insured bitcoin holders will be a big part of the economy. 
Think about it, anything you do on your computer can be hacked one way or another if your computer is completely infected or there is a key logger etc. 
@_date: 2014-06-06 22:57:45

@_date: 2014-01-23 20:56:15
im not going to argue with someone who just discredits any other point of views. You are from america i am sure and your views are based on what option you have access to. not all countries have this option to buy gift cards etc.
If any country starts really buying up bitcoin it will cause prices to rise and then all these people you say dont give a shit about bitcoin will buy bitcoin because prices are going up and they can make some money.

@_date: 2014-04-09 18:26:02
100% agree. I am a crazy person when it comes to investing and often hop on ideas instantly as I fully understand the concept of losing everything you invest but also understand the upside. 
I had this same epiphany though once I had bought because I began to research and understand it all and now its basically my biggest hobby aside from a couple sports. Bitcoin is amazing when you really understand it. 
My only concerns are 51% attack and the issue with number of transactions that get accepted per block but thats about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 23:19:08

This reddit forum made me realize how little you actually need to be a major holder if bitcoin really does go mainstream. Seems like the average holder has less than 5 btc! 
@_date: 2014-01-24 18:47:07
how much the price changes over a certain time period, can be changing by price going up or down.
example prices have been volatile this year because the price has gone up and down by large amounts. If the price was only bouncing between 800 and 805 for a whole year then we would say that is not volatile at all. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 18:00:44
I believe it had something to do with customer accounts still being reviewed and that some bitcoin related companies did not necissarily disclose everything they were doing. who knows though.

wait a bit! theres no way it will climb to 700 anytime soon. it may go up a bit and fluctuate but I would just just my money on an exchange and watch what happens. If we get something that officially says mt gox is going bankrupt and they dont plan on rebranding there will be another drop in price. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 19:04:48
that is the first true thing you have said. since the big sell off bitcoin went from 500 or so up to 800 and is now steadily sitting around 810. when a stock is not constantly going up that does not make it in a down trend.

I use bitfinex and I trust them to no end. I have had an amazing experience and their customer service is very quick to reply. I also have experience wiring money to my rbc ACCount and it was deposited the next day. 
THey should chime in though and give an update. I think that they are not big on marketing and their exchange speaks for itself.

I dont know why but websites and games that cost us nothing but are valued in the billions just makes no sense to me. Obviously its from ad revenue and whatever other sneaky tricks they have but does anyone really buy stuff that is advertised on these games? 
If i really try to think about it I literally dont remember a single product advertised in game.
Can someone explain how this company makes money? 
@_date: 2014-03-25 21:52:58
im in the same boat haha :) 
i dont care if i can use bitcoin to buy coffee locally. I will use bitcoin as a store of wealth and a way to transfer money quickly with low cost. Ill use bitcoin as a currency in the future once it is much easier and more widely accepted. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:58:21
and sit there with 200,000 in cash? use ur brain this buys bitcoin too. Also, eventually it wont need someone sitting beside it. This is a long term investment. In 2 years bitcoin will most likely be much more mainstream and every person wont require someone to hold their hand through the process. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 23:00:09
if it was me and it was 2K i would buy all bit coins and cross my fingers i can get them out of there.
My opinion is that gox will eventually figure things out and let people withdraw coins. 
No new coins will be stolen because they know about that bug and I think that if you kept it in cash and this came down to a legal dispute you would take forever to get the cash and may never get it so your chances are higher to hope to be able to withdraw the coins. also if it works out rather than getting your 2K cash you could sell the coins you buy for a heck of a lot more on another exchange once you can withdraw them :) 
@_date: 2014-01-22 23:28:17
bitcoin atm machines! also once you are actually signed up with an exchange it does not take more than 2-3 days to send money from your bank to the exchange to buy them.

i would want btc rather than cash on that site i think. your taking some good gains there selling at 350 and buying back at 275
your stuck with mt gox anyways so your better position in my mind is to sit with bitcoins rather than fiat

@_date: 2014-03-14 21:49:37
there is an article where overstock mentions there was a massive surge and it has slowed down to a steady pace of 30K a day or something. that really isnt bad considering how many people own bitcoin and the fact that most of us are hoarding because we think prices are going to shoot up soon.

merchant adoption actually means lowering of prices if it isnt matched with user adoption. People who dont own bitcoin wont just go and buy some within a day or 2 of hearing tiger direct is accepting bitcoin. its a much longer process than that. everyone who owns bitcoin right now in my opinion are just hoarding and we need new people to buy before prices start spiking again

@_date: 2014-04-09 21:19:13
id say your bet is more foolish. If you can invest into bit coin and know your deposits are insured, a lot of wealthy people will give it a shot. im not saying all of them but more than there is now when there is no safe exchange.
Also day traders may want to play the volatility. The more traders it attracts the more the overall money in the bitcoin ecosystem there would be and therefor price goes up. 
@_date: 2014-02-21 21:06:06
insider trading just makes more sense because mt gox could actually transfer the coins out after they buy them to sell on other exchanges where as customers would not be able to withdraw the coins to sell elsewhere. However it is possible that it could be someone other than mt gox but they would have to be very confident that gox would eventually release coins otherwise it would not make sense for them to buy coin on gox while selling other coins they own on other exchanges. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:04:34

I agree, they layer their book with bitstamp so they really dont need to attract the volume that other exchanges need in order for there to be enough liquidity for solid trading.

if bitcoin becomes a major payment system then how is that a failure and the end of bitcoin.

What if you have poor credit but want to shop online?

you dont know what you are talking about.... people are speculating that if the coins are sold on an exchange it will drop the price because of how exchanges work... if you understand that then you should understand why it can lower price.
If it is sold in private auction then the exchange price doesnt get affected.

@_date: 2014-01-23 20:11:47
umm just because companies are skeeky. I have a friend who runs an exchange and quotes bitstamp prices for exchange but then if another exchange is cheaper he will actually use that exchange to make the trade so he makes more money than the quoted fee.
I dont think that exact example would apply to bit pay but i do believe that they probably hold onto coins when prices go up and use other trading strategies when prices are going down etc so they make more than the fee they are quoting. 
@_date: 2014-02-06 22:48:18

love it. dont really understand the technical side of the blockchain that well but I dont see why this couldnt work. I know I would use it. 
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:49:27
It works like this. New money comes in, it attracts more investors because prices are going up from them buying in. THey sell at profit, buy low and keep doing this as prices go up. You are the one giving them money if you are buying as prices go up trying to chase them and then they sell and prices drop. If you are not part of that parade and already own bitcoin you just ride the wave as prices go up.
These investors dont buy a ton of coins and then sell it all for a profit and disappear. They just keep selling at peaks and buying back lower as prices overall increase. 
Thats not my imagination thats years of experience.   Now lets see you try to explain your theory of why im wrong lol. 
@_date: 2014-02-12 18:07:57
lol does this person even know why prices are dropping? This research he has done is based on typical markets and speculation. How can this predict that a temporary bug with bitcoin would crash prices over night.
so stupid to analyze bitcoin this way. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 17:45:31
bitfinex hands down, especially with the ability to margin buy when you think we are in a dip because price can go back up so fast and if you dont have cash on the site to buy more this is really the only option. 
You could sign up, move coins onto the site and use them as leverage to buy more, no other site would you be able to move coins onto it and buy more coins instantly. 
@_date: 2014-01-17 22:45:15
i cant believe they wouldnt just set it up. obviously an influx of customers were going to come in asking to buy food with bitcoin. could have easily capitalized on the extra revenue and press positivity!

its what im doing. i just dont understand how someone getting burned for money laundering should matter. If someone uses US dollars to fund an illegal operation obviously the US dollar value would not go down. 
Bitcoin traders just use any excuse to cause panic to temporarily drop prices so they can sell coins and buy them back cheaper. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 02:36:10
how would they explain the low cold storage amount though? THey would have a means of realizing it was dropping much faster than would make sense

some will have sold their coins around 600+ and then got to buy back at below 200 though or atleast below what they sold for. If mt.gox starts allowing withdrawals its not like everyone would be at a loss. 
@_date: 2014-06-05 19:42:48
when sell walls go up price moves up to that wall and then they pull the wall causing prices to go up further. The intent is to help price go up. Not down.

real-ly cool. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 23:48:49
check prices right now they are headed back up. i fully expect it to be over 800 within the next day or 2. this is just people selling thinking they can buy in cheaper, not people actually cashing out.
Also, if you are really nervous and this is important money to you, you can always cash out a portion. I would still wait to see the dust settle as far as todays news goes. I fully believe prices will head back up to where they were before. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 18:36:12
i use my coins to buy stuff. but i would not spend money on wire transfers and exchange fees just so i can use it instead of credit cards if I didnt have a chance to earn money from it? 
Your arguement to that is probably something like "then why is bit coin useful?" The answer is that when price goes up and bitcoin goes mainstream the costs to buy bitcoin won't be as expensive and hopefully, eventually you wont even need to have fiat currency. 
Its the potential gains that help grow bitcoin to a point where it can be mainstream. It is important to sustain the bitcoin ecosystem.

The main reason for my post is to ask if there is a bitcoin version of gofundme.com?
@_date: 2014-01-17 19:47:18
no because you need to be very wealthy to get in on this auction and they could be receiving the coins for anywhere between 10% and 50% off. Most likely a 25 mill bitcoin purchase will only be happening from these buyers because of the discount so they would not just go and buy 25 mill on an exchange at market price. if they wanted to buy 25 mill on an exchange it would increase the price far to much for it to be a good investment for them.
all coins at the same discounted price... much different story. This means that your comment about how "they would have bought on an exchange" pretty much 100% not true. 
@_date: 2014-01-28 23:07:27
i dont know iv been following it since january last year and now that it is actually worth a fair amount (700-1100) bad news drops price faster than good news increases it. I think as long as there is any uncertainty about government intervention people will be reluctant to pay more than this amount for 1 bitcoin. 
I also think bitcoin will be worth over 10K a piece within the next 3 years though. Maybe way more than 10K
@_date: 2014-06-06 23:33:45
both are good deals in my opinion. Plus. doesn't buying a celebrities vehicle come with a premium on the price lol...

the site went down yesterday right? everything prior to that was speculation. i know this has all been priced in but an official "your money is gone, gox is shutting down" statement would definitely lower price even if only for a few hours or days.

smart marketing, i think customers should know better though. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:50:05
whats the downside. bitcoin is far from dead and i dont believe there is a cost to implement if you use bitpay etc? i dont really know what the fees at the beginning are though. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 20:05:23
or you just ignore them until they adjust their rules. they needed to get some guidelines out there but doesnt mean they are set in stone for the rest of time. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 23:30:46
load your coins onto bitfinex and start trading. best gambling i know! even have a chance to get really good at it. When you pull off a good trade you get the exact same feeling as winning an awesome hand in poker. 
@_date: 2014-03-21 21:17:28
so its still there? that is a stupid place though I agree. They wont get any random traffic, only bitcoin enthusiasts. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 22:39:17
im going to buy a bunch more in the next couple weeks, I hope it stays at this price or lower. I dont expect crazy price increases until 3rd quarter this year though so should be fine. 
@_date: 2014-02-27 20:16:35
ahh ok thanks. 
@_date: 2014-04-16 20:49:56
they should buy up all of the coins that mt gox is liquidizing to provide initial liquidity for this exchange ;)
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:40:30
Look at this chart OP, you dont know what you are talking about. Its your exact thinking that gets bears a shit load of money, they can stop selling, let price go up a bit and then sell at a higher price. There is no stable uptrend. 
Oh and dont forget Im pretty sure a lot of people think mt gox could be bought out or saved in some way. If anything official comes out we will see a huge drop in price if it confirms that they are going bankrupt or disappearing etc. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 19:50:47
maybe this can help the irs ruling to change? I assume he is basically saying if bitcoin is not a currency he cant be charged? 
@_date: 2014-01-29 20:41:09
haha iv dealt with this as well. luckily convinced a bunch of people to buy who have ranged in profit from about $5000 to $40000. Needless to say those people are not calling me an idiot or lucky, they are calling me smart hahah :) 
@_date: 2014-06-07 07:34:25
wow you are embarrassing. give it up
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:17:33
if you are investing in bitcoin hoping it will go up I would try to do a bit more than $35 at this price. Sure it could go up 100X but chances are slim and if that happened you would only have $3500 and you would feel silly for only putting $35 in today :P
of course you are most likely extremely young so maybe those numbers are much more appealing to you. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 17:40:12
I loaded this up once and blew a lot of money tipping people. Kind of scared to add money again lol
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:04:34
i dunno i didnt invest so i just saw an article today saying ceo explains everything. didnt even read it. sorry for wrong info lol. 
@_date: 2014-01-24 17:48:40
hope this gets shown
@_date: 2014-04-03 03:37:24
or they have a gambling addiction indeed lol. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:32:57
with 2 btc id say hold. your in the market. if you sell now and it goes up you probably wont buy back. If you hold and just think "im willing to lose it all potentially" there is a good chance you will be looking at this decision in a year or 2 as a great one.
There are lots of people who had 50-60 coins etc when price was like 50 cents a coin, it went up to 30 bucks a coin then down to like 1 cent. If people sold and walked away, they wouldnt be sitting with all this free money today. 
Another bubble can EASILY happen again.
most people here dont know that bitcoin went up to 30 and down to 1 cent. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:40:07
thats not possible. its a good thing for the price if the coins were lost rather than stolen because it means of the 22 million that will ever exist 850,000 of them are gone making the rest more scarce. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:38:35
most likely they are referring to an escrow service where as the money is moved to a 3rd party account to show it is available. It would stay there until both parties agree that the work has been done (aka the product ships). I dont think there is a functioning legit service that offers this yet but it will definitely be common in the near future i would imagine. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 00:45:59
of course why not? i would hope that i could replenish my stash for the same cost though otherwise i would just use cash instead. 
this is only because i have the exact amount of coins i am happy with from an investment perspective. if they are worth a butt load in the future then i wouldnt really care about replenishing my stash after making a big bitcoin purchase. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 20:31:17
that they fixed 
@_date: 2014-04-03 00:15:13
no problem, and best advice i can give is if you are in bitcoin and it starts crashing again. sell some coins and increase your stash as price goes down rather than panicing and cashing out only to want to get back in later and having to start over. 
@_date: 2014-02-28 18:20:53
bummer! Hope that works out. I checked it out and atleast it seems those stock prices are going up rather than down at the moment. 
at least its better than getting Goxed! 
@_date: 2014-02-24 19:29:39
what are you trying to say exactly? people shouldnt have said price was stable because they should have been able to know the future? It was stable until this gox drama. 
@_date: 2014-03-01 00:56:28
haha so your saying everyone should abandoned bitcoin because its going to get hacked eventually? Im pretty sure you are one of a very small amount of people who this that. 
@_date: 2014-04-11 00:37:14
ya this is crazy. i think its time for even old money to cash out for a bit even if its just to buy back lower. we need us exchanges with firm banking relationships otherwise bitcoin will stay sub 300 
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:46:14
thanks allthefoxes. honestly i was just giving you a hard time because I knew a title like this would go over much better and start real conversation and questioning :) 
@_date: 2014-02-14 21:32:11
nice!

@_date: 2014-01-16 22:18:02
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:56:08
seems like a pretty big deal. as a bitcoin user i dont care if the company i use my coins at keeps them or uses one company or another to convert  them to their preferred currency. They are still allowing me to use my bitcoin to buy stuff at their stores so that is definitely a win. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 22:42:57
why would people ditch bitcoin when it can but updated to add missing features. the infrastructure and amount of computers contributing to the blockchain make it unlikely that it will every be worth dropping it to go to another type of crypto. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 23:18:20
was jsut reading that naughty america is now accepting bit coin on the front page of this reddit and saw a quote from the CEO that basically says EXACTLY what i wrote above...Id have to say this sort of backs the fact that i presented something to argue about. 
“In the United States, we can use our credit card to go out and buy things. We can go use our credit card to buy adult entertainment, we can use our checking account, all these different things. But, when it comes to these other countries … look at India, they don’t even have kissing in the movies. So, think about those countries and what could happen with something like bitcoin.”
@_date: 2014-03-05 23:06:35
they are straight up bankrupt. there liabilities are much hire than their assets. Like dogeholio said. possibly, months down the road, you could get cents on the dollar if you are part of the lawsuit. 
@_date: 2014-06-03 22:49:33
walk over to cointrader's office in vancouver and buy it on the spot. 
@_date: 2014-01-23 20:32:18
fair enough. they arent saying its profitable mining though lol. luckily these cards have other uses so hopefully noone gets burned this way. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 19:45:45
i mean ask :) 
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:13:38
they should have an option in this poll about accepting partial payment in bit coin
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:08:42
you need to have an account on a bitcoin exchange to buy from your phone or computer which takes time and you have to send in identification and wait to get verified. 
@_date: 2014-04-01 23:35:01
You're welcome! and thats awesome you are on here and thinking about investing. If i were you and you do invest $35 you should put it only a paper wallet and make a couple copies and keep it safe. also write down the address so you can just keep sending money to the paper wallet as you save up and in a few years you will have put a lot more than $35 and if bitcoin has gone up you will be light years ahead of anyone your age financially. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 20:49:37
haha i hope that bitcoin gets so big that anyone buying now is still considered an early adopter! 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:49:48
until it becomes useful... if bitcoin is going to catch on this is one feature that lots of companies will need. as an employee i would want 10% of my earnings to be paid in bitcoin right now! Im sure im not the only one.
You sound pretty ignorant, 
@_date: 2014-01-31 22:17:09
other than that is there any other risks if you are buying the insurance for 20% of the profits? 
@_date: 2014-02-21 02:17:04
y? for hyping a 2 second increase in price on gox?
@_date: 2014-02-21 06:22:00
Did saying that make you feel superior, you're a creep. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 21:55:27
DUDE, bitcoiniacs has an online exchange that costs .5% to buy bitcoin! the charge is a convenience charge for people who dont want to give away their personal information and want to get coins instantly. I bought bitcoin from this atm at 335 per coin with a 5% fee and the price was over $700 per coin within a week. If i went through the trouble to sign up to an exchange and get verified I would have wasted a week and paid twice as much.
THe atm fee will go down once there are a few more atms in vancouver, maybe even as soon as there is 1 other machine. They pay someone to be there full time and they split the fee with the manufacturer. This article mentions something like $20,000 is done per day. THats $1000 in fees. $500 of which go to bitcoiniacs. take out the cost of paying an employee for 12 hours which is $144 and that means they make $356 per day on average. That  goes towards paying off the $19,000 ATM price and most likely goes towards the interest they are paying for borrowing money to buy the atm. 
If more manufacturers create atms then maybe some will sell them without asking for half of all transactions fees which means they could cut the fee in half to 2.5%. If 2.5% didnt inspire people to come and try to undercut sales then they could probably get rid of the atm "chaperone" and charge even lower of a fee. 
@_date: 2014-02-11 18:55:39
good point!
@_date: 2014-04-09 23:01:59

or the upside lol 
@_date: 2014-02-20 00:16:23
i used a calculator and it said that is midnight tonight pacific time.. 3am eastern standard time... is that correct? 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:43:00
people are buying hoping that what is happening is actually someone buying out mt gox. 
We are not close to the bottom if it turns out gox actually lost all the coins and is shutting down
@_date: 2014-04-02 22:19:28
why would you make the title of this to sound like its a bad thing. everyones first glance will think it has to do with bitcoin crashing. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 22:50:22
im sure u are right 
@_date: 2014-01-24 19:03:35
amen haha
@_date: 2014-03-06 23:53:57
cool thanks! Was seeing if it was related at all to what happened with Cointrader (they announced BMO shut down their accounts)

You know you could still do all those things if a bank worked with bitcoin right? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 22:59:37
honestly i think around 1600-1800
@_date: 2014-04-16 17:22:29
what is this? 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:51:38
because you have to jump through a bunch of hoops with customer service to prove identity. 
@_date: 2014-04-10 18:26:24
why is everyone so worried about losing all your fiat if you truly are fiat haters :P keep your coins yo. 
@_date: 2014-05-15 18:34:34

@_date: 2014-02-22 00:01:20
meth probably 
@_date: 2014-04-01 21:50:49
for now though, for you to say bitcoin has failed makes me just think that you have failed in understanding what is happening in the bitcoin world. 
@_date: 2014-06-04 19:49:43
why do people complain about the 5% fees? The only reason they are using the atm is because they are too lazy or dumb to use an exchange lol. 
@_date: 2014-02-24 22:10:30
if you cant figure this out they can unlock your account if you email support. 
@_date: 2014-02-19 03:26:48
you didn't look at the settings but you were asking them to add a setting? lol
@_date: 2014-04-02 21:39:13
i have been buying a ton on the dips but selling as soon as it bounces up a bit and then repeating every time the price drops suddenly. so im probably not helping lol. 
@_date: 2014-02-17 19:48:56
whats this about? 
@_date: 2014-01-28 00:23:40
oh LOL nice work ur rich now good job selling for less than 3 bucks. 
@_date: 2014-01-13 20:40:09
very cool 
@_date: 2014-03-04 20:07:33
this seems very relevant and awesome
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:26:27
isnt this one of those situations someone can enhance the image qualify and steal the coins? 
@_date: 2014-01-31 18:02:48
this is really good news if true
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:15:59
you are right but if you are holding and buying rather than trying to play the market then we are definitely going to make money from them joining the party.
@_date: 2014-03-03 22:10:42
thanks ill try that too. 
@_date: 2014-02-22 00:29:43
Im just saying they found the bug and if they lost the coins i dont think they would just let people keep buying imaginary coins unless it was full fledged 100% fraud. 
I think the people who would lose coins are people who bought before the glitch was found if they are trying to be legit and not commit theft. 
@_date: 2014-03-04 23:16:58
was totally thinking it was going to be him when i read the title. 
@_date: 2014-03-27 18:27:31
... noone is saying you have to use an atm. You pay for the convenience. not everyone wants to go through the hassle of setting up an account online and also a lot of people dont feel like uploading their personal info to those websites. Its really not hard to 'get'
@_date: 2014-02-25 20:08:26
lol i think that announcement that popped up could be from someone hacking the site to help create a price rise. i think price is going to drop heavily again sometime soon, 
@_date: 2014-01-30 17:59:01
bitcoiniacs have all proper licensing to do what they are doing in Canada. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:56:03
47% of them also probably dont own bitcoin and are pissed they didnt cash in on the 2013 boom lol.
This kind of info can be taken with a grain of salt in my opinion. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:33:10
i wonder if the cost would make it a bad idea. if this was going on with no other bad news i feel like it wouldnt affect price or anything and the spammer would just be wasting money. 
@_date: 2014-01-30 02:33:19
I saw lots of people posting that they were today
@_date: 2014-04-02 20:11:27

@_date: 2014-03-04 20:47:12
have you seen this on reddit yet? I dont think you have. Notice the document says february 26th as well so I wouldnt call it old news even if you saw this document when it was released and spoke russian. 
@_date: 2014-02-25 18:56:21
maybe. 
@_date: 2014-03-11 00:16:26
this is a great idea! I 100% support this decision. For 5K that is a pretty good way to get bitcoin out there. 
@_date: 2014-05-08 22:14:25
they are desperate. Id love to know how often people post about bitcoin on the dogecoin sub. probably close to never.

What bad news out out of canada?
All those other things I agree with though. im sure another run up in price will be just around the corner. 
@_date: 2014-02-13 23:13:41
way to take my example out of the copy and paste...? 
im not going to sit here and come up with a bunch of ideas or message the developers but someone spamming transactions is not a big hurdle for them to overcome. 
@_date: 2014-01-29 22:13:02
lol obviously. you should re read my post though. i said their online exchange is .5% and their atm is 5% so i dont understand your comment 
@_date: 2014-03-07 20:58:13

@_date: 2014-02-13 20:21:09
youd be surprised. id say most of the price drop right now is from people selling to buy in lower using the bad news as fuel for the price drop. 
@_date: 2014-05-27 19:46:38
i know people who hold lots in blockchain wallets with 2 factor set up and they seem pretty confident. I prefer better options but Im sure you could get away with just using blockchain wallets
@_date: 2014-01-20 20:30:31
send a message to coinbase or email. they will set you up and walk you through the process. apparently its really easy to do and they will implement it for you. Also i think you get $1,000,000 worth of transactions with no cost and then its like 1% fee after that or $3000 a month if you think that would end up being cheaper for your museum 
@_date: 2014-04-03 01:56:44
first time i have ever mentioned that and im almost 100% sure that people who bought in 2013 who arent fully obsessed with bitcoin dont know much about what prices were like before. 
@_date: 2014-01-21 23:04:28
just remember most people into bitcoin think its going to probably go on another steep price incline soon so they rather use regular fiat to pay expensive bills like dental work. 
As more people jump on board and prices stabilize you will receive more and more inquiries and purchases in bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-04-03 19:40:09

i bought them from a guy in my town actually. havent actually earned any but i bought my first coins when it was much cheaper.
Its acceptable to ask that forsure as long as your next question isnt " how many coins do you have" :)

just a couple articles used that number but I highly doubt it is true now that I think about it. 
@_date: 2014-03-28 22:15:27
well if they are getting shut down it makes sense that eventually people have sold what they are going to sell and the rest is being cashed out. 
@_date: 2014-03-07 18:36:13
its the mt gox coin movement, if it were getting sold or even some of it, the price would go down so people could buy back in cheaper. and its friday ;) 
@_date: 2014-03-12 22:04:53
in todays world companies valuation are not based on as much hype as that though. They actually have revenue and 100 million internet nerd critics keeping them in check!

@_date: 2014-01-23 01:43:26
you have no idea what your talking about, I follow bitcoin every day. check this graph and you will see it is clearly not trending down. over last 30 days its trending up except for a big spike that lasted only 2 days on a weekend. 
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:02:51
its relevant in that the bitcoin community have actively been promoting the shift and that the op makes a point that it is a good time for people to do what they can to persuade apple to accept bitcoin related apps so they do not lose customers. 
I agree its not direct but i come here for bitcoin information and I found this info relevant and it also makes me happy lol. 
@_date: 2014-02-20 08:10:36
no just watching because I think the whales trying to scare the market just found their bottom price and are now buying back in. Too entertaining to go to bed. 
@_date: 2014-02-14 17:57:13
i have not sold on any dips and I kind of wish i had every time and bought lower. I know how the market works now but im too stubborn to move my coins to an exchange from cold storage lol. 
@_date: 2014-04-07 22:54:52
hope you get this figured out!

@_date: 2014-02-25 00:16:40
common lets be serious. They obviously keep a lot of it in cold storage. any coins in cold storage could not have been stolen. just cuz theft has been going on for years doesnt mean it would have been on a massive scale. Mt. gox would have noticed otherwise
@_date: 2014-03-12 23:04:10
much more logical explanation than anything else iv heard.
"canada doesnt matter" etc lol

ill throw this into the positive news column but doesnt mean to much until they let the exchanges run their business properly and allow merchants to accept bitcoin.

whoa! this is serious actually considering stripe just announced they are testing bitcoin.

i think you are over analyzing a bit. i spoke with the owners and i know for a fact that their intentions were 100% to go all canada and then these other oportunities presented themselves due to government statements giving them pretty much a 100% green light to operate in those countries. 
@_date: 2014-01-15 22:51:18
100% yes lol. cant lose! regarding the crash it went up to 1150 then down to 450 now sitting around 850. it has been proven that prices of 1150 or more are possible so i think it can easily get there again within the next few months. (or weeks) 
@_date: 2014-02-25 22:30:08
no... we are the largest exchange? lol common this is not believable at all. THe same people who helped dump price are helping temporarily raise the price and winning on every change in direction.

I see I got downvotes while I was writing the actual message I wanted to share. Is there a way to post a proper comment when creating a new link post rather than adding a comment after the topic has been posted? 
@_date: 2014-05-30 19:28:41
only if you are dumb would it take 2 days to teach you. Most people I actually take the time to show how to use it takes me about 5-10 minutes. Not everyone needs super security when they own a fraction of a bitcoin or even a few bitcoins. A wallet like blockchain.info with 2 factor added is good enough.

Chris odem is still part owner of monetas jus doesn't work there so I assume some of the technology still exists as part of monetas?
@_date: 2015-08-15 14:53:52
They dropped open transactions? I thought it's just that Chris odem left but didn't take the technology with him?  He's still a part owner of monetas just doesn't work for them?

why isnt there just a bitcoin bank. 5 bucks a month fee for anyone who is too rookie or scared to handle holding their own coins. THey could also provide investment type charts and graphs to show the clients how much interest they are earning on their investments etc. Seems like a no brainer to me. Id pay 5 bucks a month no problem. 
@_date: 2013-06-12 19:36:08
dont they sell anything else? I keep hearing about the USB's but there is only like 2500 sold or something. Where is all the other revenue coming from? I believe over half of dividends each week is coming from sales...

ya either that or you're wrong lol. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 23:51:19
Cant all old transactions be removed from the blockchain and just stored separately so all the bitcoin nodes dont have to carry so much date for the blockchain?
The reason the 1mb exists is to stop the blockchain size from expanding too quickly if im not mistaken?

this is a very dumb reply. Why would it not mean they want to work with bitcoin if they are adding a way for their high net worth clients to invest in bitcoin?

ya they made a lot less this time than last time

pretty sure people think that a second digital currency will be needed if block size and other issues come up from over usage of bitcoin. not to replace it but maybe to handle small transactions or a niche type of purchase or use. Exchanging between digital currencies is as easy as pie so 2 can co exist pretty easily. 
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:54:51
see right below. Friedcat the owner explained they are already working on generation 2 chips. Most peoples concerns and the reason why share prices werent moving was because they thought asicminer would lose market share but this news shows they are already working on generation 2 stuff while all the other guys are still trying to get their origional product out! Its going to be a long time of strong market share and high dividends.!

its headed back up. Its probably trouble shooting again, moving some hardware etc. People are more scared to sell based on guessing why hashrate is down and be wrong and then have to buy back in at higher than they sold. 
Same thing happened last week PS.

id say do it that way and in the "how to" part of your site say if you want to send a certain amount please include a .0001 miner fee otherwise recipient will receive .0001 less than you intended or something like that?
I dunno, or just have people learn how to use the thing. however the auto replies saying it didn't work can be a bit spammy so maybe its best to include the tip...
@_date: 2013-04-24 20:17:33
nice! Now write a little blurb about why they should and post it here so everyone can just copy and paste it and hit send by email. Youlll triple your ideas effectiveness this way. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:12:31
why wouldnt they just use bitcoin.. they can make money in so many ways by using bitcoin and could focus on exchange fees etc.
@_date: 2013-05-02 16:53:19
this is completely false in my opinion. people get scared when there is no big news coming out and sell because they dont see their investment increasing. We just need some good news to come out and it will go up. You cant compare this to some terminology from graph readers.

I agree with you. There is 40 repeats of stupid articles every day, just because there is 1 or 2 threads a week about asicminer stocks doesnt mean you have to get your panties in a bunch. Its still a good investment so if anything it may be nice getting people aware what is out there to invest in,

stock up on the currency and tell them to put their money where there mouth is and say if it doesnt double in value in the next 3 years you will pay them 5 grand, and they will pay you 5 grand if it does double.

they should promote americans to invest in bitcoin and take a bit of the wealth from the rest of the world as it catches on globally lol. Could help the poverty level. Think if US accounted for 60% of the early adopters, that would distribute lots of other countries wealth into US.
@_date: 2013-04-12 22:32:04
he says its here to say and that hes seriously considering putting 2-3% of his wealth into bit coin and we all know how huge of a following this guy has

lets hope they are good numbers and they feel like bragging then lol

any idea if you can transfer shares from btco to bitfunder or the other way around? 
@_date: 2013-12-27 22:11:52
the savings through bitpay are guaranteed. I dont think the writer knows this. If visa was 3% and bitpay was 1% and they automatically exchange to the vendors preferred currency, that 2% savings is 100% set in stone. 
Id say thats a pretty important reason to accept bit coin and I dont like how the writer brushes that off so easily. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:47:05
they wont be using this i dont think until regulation requires it. if it ever does. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 20:49:07
not to mention a store could accept bitcoin for a much lower cost than credit cards with 0 chance of fraud.. that is fairly useful as well if you ask me.

I dont understand why professional writers so often dont take 2 seconds to get their facts straight before the write an article. It says the peak price of bitcoin was around $200. It would probably take one google search to find out it was more like $266.

@_date: 2013-05-21 17:39:43
best way to think about it is to compare it to your average dividend paying shares in a mature market. Normally 1-5% a year is the range of dividends. Asicsminer shares are paying almost 50% based on their share price so I think they are undervalued.

spending small amounts actually will indirectly increase bitcoins value. Even if you are losing out on the gains from that small amount you spent, you are contributing to bitcoins future as a currency and the adoption speed.

hahah im serious thats what i did. when i first bought coins i printed a few hundred paper wallets (each page has 7 or something) Just under a month later i just wrote the number 1 beside one of the hundreds and put coins in it. Did again to a few others. Now I have paper wallets from months ago that I can use any time in the future when need be!

looks like that wall ended up lowering the price! 
@_date: 2013-08-23 19:55:32
i agree, if bitcoin really takes off over the next few years even a 5K investment will have you looking pretty financially strong in that time frame. I would considering investing that much right now if you have access to it. Even if it is a line of credit because you can slowly pay it off. I think this fall we are going to see a price run. I bet by the end of december prices will be stable over $200. 
Thats just me though.

@_date: 2013-05-17 19:33:04
remember that bitcoin owners as a whole become more and more resistant to bad news. Drops are very short lived and require worse and worse news to actually drop at all. I dont expect it being lower other than maybe a few bucks over the weekend. Once all the news from the bitcoin convention this weekend hits the internet on monday I expect prices to start climbing more rapidly for a bit. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:12:49
if i just have coins in cold wallets this doesnt affect me in any way right?
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:44:26
iv been watching today and id say best strategy is leave most of those stocks alone but maybe with 5 or so try to sell before dividend and by back at a lower value. There is a bigger spread than the dividend but only for a few lucky people watching the prices all day... is it worth it? probably not since im wasting my time at work lol
@_date: 2013-12-12 23:29:53
if more people invested when it was $1 for 1 mbtc then it would no longer be $1 for 1mBTC lol :)

@_date: 2013-05-22 21:03:53
you have never invested before have you? thats around 43% per year. Most dividend paying stocks pay between 1 and 5% per year..... dont forgot the value of the stocks can also rise which is also earnings.
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:52:10
I dissagree. I think that it may affect the max value per coin so from an investment perspective the existence of alt coins may suck a bit. But if bitcoin becomes 100,000 per coin instead of 120,000 per coin and an alt coin like litecoin handles some smaller transactions to help bitcoin run more smoothly then that isnt so bad.
i think an alt coin only will be valueable and exist if bitcoin cant fix issues that arise from scalability problems,

where do you think prices will be in the next 2-3 weeks?
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:15:53
lol this is horrible logic. That price drop happened within minutes. You are assuming the other option is watching the market literally all day and somehow loading an exchange in time to get that drop (which happens to take an hour so you would have missed it anyways)
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:51:00
also you dont just go buying bitcoin for yourself when you have a ton of other expenses around christmast/holiday season. This is not perfect science and obviously there are lots of exceptions but I think his Point is very relevant.

but for people who are just trying to get into the bitcoin game and are scared of technology and dont care about hiding their identity would easily prefer a service like this as opposed to having to be their own bank and worry about paper wallets etc. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:08:19
that doesnt make sense though as the market value of all bitcoin is like 13 billion or whatever. If it was being used for 10% of B2C transactions in the world there is no possible way it could only be worth 12 billion? There wouldnt be enough coins to do 10% of all global e-commerce B2C transactions if they were only worth what they are today. 
That is a stupid way to judge value on his part and makes no sense.

yep and it depends on the person as well. I wouldnt lend to anyone. basically i just lend money to friends to fix their credit score and help them get approved for low interest lines of credit (5.5%) instead of the 20% credit cards they are used to and they pay me back with the line of credit and i earn a fee for the work. only do this with people who have high paying salary jobs who just let their spending get the best of them.

@_date: 2013-04-29 18:23:03
To avoid this it could stay completely anonymous and you could charge your fee in bitcoin. Remember to create a website with a nice design would not cost alot so the risk of taking bitcoins as payment wouldnt be too bad. If you are paper walleting all the money and only leaving a small amount in an online wallet you wouldnt have to worry about theft so large that it would put you out of business

@_date: 2013-11-15 23:55:46
when the market value of bitcoin is in the 100 billions it will sure help. THere may be price fluctuations but you wont think of the dollar amount swings, you will think about the percent swings.
If a coin is worth 10,000 one day and $9,900 the next day that would only be a 1% change which would be considered pretty darn stable. 
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:11:40

as bitcoin stabilizes people with lots of coins will be more likely to invest in thinks like these stocks because they wont care about being liquid to avoid losing money in crashes.

maybe if it was accepted today and 1 billion in sales happened tomorrow that they converted to US right away.

@_date: 2013-05-03 16:38:01
this is 75 million. by the time mt gox would have to pay they would have earned 100X that money if they lose. more likely a settlement. Like Turd said, this doesnt affect the value of a coin. It just means these companies realize bitcoin is the real deal. Its actually a good thing
@_date: 2013-06-25 20:41:50
exactly. They were up the high 40's maybe higher if my memory is correct which means they have the hardware. It could be anything from a glitch to a power outage etc. 
also the hash rate that everyone is used to checking is just based on mined coins not the actual power of their machines so if they have bad luck for a bit it seems like they are running less miners.
@_date: 2013-12-02 19:49:17
it doesnt
@_date: 2013-05-14 18:27:07
ya I follow all things bitcoin and I just think this is what is needed more than anything. A company could keep 95% of their holdings in cold storage so they are secure. They would accept monthly fees in bitcoin so that it keeps thing simple and customers can expect longer withdrawal times for large withdrawals so that the company could take the time to remove coins from cold storage! 
@_date: 2013-07-05 19:10:25
whats wrong with cutting your losses? your basically telling people who invested their hard earned money into bitcoin to just have blind faith and HOPE for the best.
@_date: 2013-05-17 22:51:15
I just want to be on the most liquid market thats all. Not related to price directly. If I sell all most stock on bitfunder i will lose quite a bit when re buying on btct.co. 
How many stocks do I need in order to transfer them rather then selling and rebuying? 
@_date: 2013-06-24 23:31:14
ya very strange that the one tracked on asicminercharts hasnt moved since this morning. maybe they wanted to start a new address for their mining profits (or had to)
@_date: 2013-11-23 00:20:12
i dotn think any on this list are lost. they all have transacted in 2013. i doubt anyone who had that amount of coins and who has moved them this year would have lost them.

most likely lots of exchange money going back into bitcoin now that the chinese have seen how far the crash when down. its not like everyone got their money off the exchange instantly, they just sold and left it there i bet. 
@_date: 2013-12-19 19:20:00
I really dont think it matters. bottom line is all entrepreneurs are focusing on building the bitcoin infrastructure because they are not earning their incomes based on the price of bitcoin. It just makes sense to roll with the most established coin which means alts will take a LONG time to take off.

thats speculation though. and in reality bitpay can sell the coins on the spot if they dont want the risk.
also when overstock or amazon accept bitcoin its not like they will start doing millions of business per day. the amount of transactions will go hand in hand with overall addoption of bitcoin. if we have reached the point where millions would be getting spent on these websites per day through bitcoin then it is basically guaranteed the price fluctuations will be MUCH less due to market saturation. 
its just picking information how the writer wants to present it and it seems in this sense fairly negatively.

id say the only legit price we have seen was between 105 and 120 so I compare prices to that. I think a lot of people know that the news from Gox about being able to withdraw US funds will affect prices so people are waiting around and not buying. 
While people are not buying, the normal sale of coins is happening from business like bitpay and the average joe who wanted some fiat for that long weekend camping trip etc.

ya free is obviously better but Its not like you cant do cold wallets yourself, this is a service for the beginners and people who dont mind paying a fee. 
If this service existed im sure many more people would get into bitcoin and therefor prices would rise more quickly. With that happening the $5 month fee would be far less than the speed at which prices rise.
If there was a service like this where my money was guaranteed then I would probably have about 10X the amount of bitcoins that I have right now.

paper wallets work fine. print off a couple hundred. wait a few weeks and then randomly select ones to put coins in. Works like a charm. If someone hacked you they will try right away and find emply addresses. I couldnt imagine they would want to try hundreds of paper wallet private keys either. and they especially wouldnt try all of them a few weeks after they were generated.

20 mill in comparison to 35 million is not at all close when we are talking about it being compared to a 75 million lawsuit. One would take just over 2 years to cover the amount being sued and the other would take almost 4 years.

sounds like were on the same page! its so people cannot take more than 3K a day which avoids money laundering rules set in place by the banks.

One of the exchanges should reach out to the people holding these funds and offer to help them do a private sale if they infact want to liquidate. Will avoid affecting the market.

we recovered from that last crash too quickly to doubt bitcoin in my mind. over the last few days lots of new good info has been coming out. Im sure we will be up to the 1150 ish prices on bitstamp within the week

@_date: 2013-11-23 08:08:42
of course you can... i see this arguement too often. how could you not call someone stupid if they made 10K from bitcoin in a month and then took it all out. If someone left a quarter of their gains in bitcoin and became a millionaire i would tell the person who decided to take all of it out the dumbest person in the world and id argue with him until they realized how dumb they truly were
@_date: 2013-05-03 20:44:04
that was talk not action, they could be saying that to distract people while they are secretly fighting it etc. If they were to actually do this, that is an entirely different thing. 
@_date: 2013-07-03 18:46:23
lol i love wednesdays i just bought more shares for way cheaper than they cost yesterday. Whenever dividends are announced people try to sell to buy back in lower. it doesnt make any sense!
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:51:02
i still dont understand how this logic works. If it becomes a major medium of exchange obviously more people will be trying to get a hold of bitcoin so they can transfer money and therefor increasing the value. Its not possible for it to become a big player without the price going up. Much higher than $1300.
Rubish logic.

Is there anything different between the TAT.ASICMINER shares on bitfunder which are like the 100th of a share version compared to the ones on havlock investments?
or are they the exact same... price seems identical but the amount of trades on havlock is like 100X as many
@_date: 2013-12-04 00:10:58
you get rich because of something i think you wouldnt just try to distroy it. why not just cash out 100K a day? why sell 80 million in one day?
Doesnt make sense unless it is someone whos main objective is to destroy bitcoin which i doubt people who got rich from it would do. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:14:24
the cost is higher for 100 of those than 1 full share so if you are going long I think full shares are by far the better option. Not to mention you get 100% of dividends instead of 95%.
I agree with the liquidity though but look at the order books for the full shares. They are very easy to sell at not far below the lowest buy price!
@_date: 2013-05-16 19:33:02
hahah i want both of those to be honest as long as they are onezies 
@_date: 2013-04-24 17:06:52
lol this is a good call too many omg the price dropped 10 bucks. it wasnt even at 150 yesterday. whats the big dealio someone just cashed in some coins good for them! 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:56:47
it will come tomorrow or later today. THe passthrough is run by people who are busy so they dont push on the dividends instantly. Not to worry!

This is not looking good. 20% less mining revenue this week. Percentage of total hash is down to 12% of total network from 23% and their hardware is sold out :( I'm thinking low dividends for a while
@_date: 2013-04-24 21:18:42
i bet they lower fees soon. THey could hardly handle the load as it was because of being so short staffed. Higher fees probably kept the growth in check. I actually got a call from them on the weekend saying they hired a bunch of new staff. 
@_date: 2013-11-29 21:21:48
i call it a correction but i think we have a while before it happens and the drop in price will be gobbled up soon after. 
@_date: 2013-07-29 20:53:53
yep i am just arguing this guys posting. Yes it grows in value depending on how many people use it just like anything in the world. Its amount of use is derived from how useful it is. This guy doesn't seem to understand why bitcoin exists. 
Its not just here for people to tell their friends to buy it so their coins are worth more.

From a bitcoiner in china
I am using China Telecom's network, until now at least network traffic related to Bitcoin is OK.
Keep in mind that law in China works differently from that of West, in two ways:
1.Anything not explicitly permitted by law is technically prohibited;
2.No one will enforce the "not permitted yet not explicitly prohibited" part of the law until someone sees a chance to make money or directives are received from "relevant organs".(so yes we break laws everyday)
In this case, I guess it's China Telecom's management's own idea, not sure at which level the decision is made, but there must be some interest groups related to CT already feeling the threat of Bitcoin.

i 100% agree with the OP. and regarding buying bitcoins as gifts. i doubt that.. id say much more likely that the people giving them as gifts have big stashes and are sharing from that. Atleast thats what im doing.
Also to support his claim i cashed out 15K a couple weeks ago for vacation and christmas presents etc. A large amount of people who have done well in bitcoin got into it this year so a christmas cash out makes a ton of sense. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:57:35

also it drops so much because its not a deep market. If there were more people asking to buy at 800, when that guy sold it wouldnt have moved the price. Once the amount of activity doubles on the exchanges, theoretically large sales should drop the price half a quickly. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 20:39:15
wish there was more atm's. i am from vancouver and the fees are a bit high on the atm but with the way prices move paying the fee is totally worth it to skip the buying process of signing up with an exchange. also go local bitcoins they have decent prices most of the time and you can make a purchase right away. dont worry about a full bitcoin it is irrelevant. 
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:37:40
yep i agree but im just saying i dont think it would be able to move fast enough for 13 billion to be enough to be recycled to cover 10% of all ecommerce b2c transactions thats all. It would literally only be possible if noone held bitcoin for any other purchase and every bitcoin used to move money was instantly put back onto the exchange.
I wish i knew how much money is transferred daily in ecommerce b2c! I feel like it would be a lot more than 13 billion worth of bitcoin could handle if they are doing 10% of it.

doing the math its not as much of a bubble as you think. If they can give around .02 per week per share that justifies the current price easily.

I really want to do this myself but my regular job is far to tedious to take on a side project of this magnitude. I wanted to put the idea out there for anyone to scoop up.

@_date: 2013-04-24 23:06:52
once i disconnect though are the generated wallets still real?
also, what happens once i print them off and reboot. I can see you would just send money to that address but then what do I use to gain access to that address once i decide to take it out of the paper wallet?

@_date: 2013-11-29 17:17:48
the steps you mentioned above would be for your second and 3rd purchases I would think. I highly recommend using localbitcoins.com. Create an exchange account while you are bored for future purchases. Get started the easy way. Eventually there will be ATM machines everywhere to buy Bitcoin. Part of the effort now is that you are getting in early and your efforts are rewarded. 
@_date: 2013-11-23 07:45:37
anyone who has made serious gains from bitcoin and cashes out 100% of their holdings is a complete idiot
DO you realize you could have taken 60K and left 20K in and you would be a millionaire in a couple years if bitcoin succeeds?
you are either lieing or extremely stupid
@_date: 2013-10-22 22:07:45
why wouldnt you just explain it to us so we dont all have to do the same thing?
@_date: 2013-12-06 00:13:06
Thanks I was just argueing that if they had 10% of ecommerce b2c transactions that the value would have to be much higher than 1300 per coin because 13billion market cap would not be enough to move around 10% of all ecommerce b2c transactions. 
it just wouldnt be possible because this is not centralized so if i sent money to someone, those same coins wouldnt be able to be sent by another person to whoever they are sending it to. THis would mean the value of the coins would have to go way up so that you didnt need to send as many coins and still be able to move the amount of value needed.
@_date: 2013-11-21 18:45:53
they set rules for people accepting bitcoin as payment for goods and they regulate the exchanges so you need to follow the rules when buying or selling bitcoins.

did you see the list of what gift cards can be bought. Of course people wont buy coins to buy gift cards. However, people with large stashes, especially people who have earned a ton of money from bitcoin would much rather just use them to buy gift cards rather than paying the fees to cash out on an exchange. (not to mention the issues with banks seeing massive deposits into peoples accounts when they cash out)

awesome I own 10 full shares. Should i keep them as passthrough or should i ever consider of getting direct shares?
Not sure what to do now that I own 10. should i just sit back and enjoy the ride?

Is it better to buy full shares or partial?

amen! everyone i talk to says its too late but thats BS there are many reasons why bitcoin has the potential to be worth thousands per coin

that is very weird. I wonder why they want to come onto reddit to talk crap? Do you think its people who never invested so they like to see people who want bitcoin to do well be wrong?

because there is a limited supply of bitcoins, if they want to buy coins demand will be larger than the supply, people will start selling for more and more because they can.

so are you saying it is more profitable to buy fractional shares? I love to hear multiple points of view on this. I think i have enough full shares so all my future purchases will be fractional ones anyways because dividends arent high enough to wait for enough to buy full shares!

this is not making sense. you only get notifications from online wallets lol. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 18:51:27
as bitcoin stabilizes people with lots of coins will be more likely to invest in thinks like these stocks because they wont care about being liquid to avoid losing money in crashes.
I bet tons of money will go into bitcoin related stocks in the near future.

Haha have you guys seen the website where you download the app. There is a chart on the right that shows downloads in the last month. The day they accepted bitcoin the chart spikes instantly straight up. If that doesn't show the value of accepting bitcoin I don't know what does!!!!

buy 500 worth and save the rest for if there is a drop or if it goes up by another 5 bucks a coin then maybe drop another 500 and start watching again. too hard to know when to buy but doing it this way gives you a good chance of coming out on top overall

there are graphs on the website where you buy and sell are there not?? it should show growth of the price over time.
@_date: 2013-12-18 19:54:40
this is a good time to start dollar cost averaging. maybe buy $100 -$200 a day for a couple weeks. I think we may not be at the lowest price but I think that it wont get much lower before people calm down and it starts going up again. We had $150 support all day long without china. I think we have a much higher support now even without china as many new people have got involved. 
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:53:11
i dont understand what this means at all? THere is kiddy porn on the internet does this mean i shouldnt use the internet? I dont see how this affects anyone using bitcoin? 
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:20:30
or they could just set up contracts with exchanges in as many countries as possible and start the process. If they covert the money themselves in those countries im sure it would cost them less than the wire transfer costs.

there must be a ton of people who fit this though that invest with fidelity but yes if the average joe cant do this then its not as large as this article makes it seem.
However it means fidelity wants to work with bitcoin which means they could implement further options for lower net worth clients,. 
@_date: 2013-11-15 19:19:48
sell everything you own and buy now ;)
but honestly i would do $1000 right now and then the rest after the senate meeting next week. Unfortunately the meeting could cause prices to go up if its purely positive but if it turns out to be more negative we will get a flash crash and you could scoop up some cheaper coins before prices start going up again.

i think the best way especially for small amounts is basically saying you bought the coin with your own money. pay tax on any gains when you cash it out.
if you are doing lots of work for coins go approach 1.
@_date: 2013-11-19 01:04:09
i disagree with this post. i think that once the world understands bitcoin more a lot of things will accept bitcoin with one confirmation. also growth phases are tricky. as it levels out im sure they will be able to make sure confirmations happen every 10 minutes.

bitcoin is a perfect value transfer it just needs to be used by everything, banks, vendors, people etc.
banks just need to suck it up and know they cant charge so much on transfers anymore. (or anything for that matter lol)
they need to regulate criminal activity and money laundering i guess. 
@_date: 2013-05-08 22:12:32
they have customer service? lol ya its bad
what are you trying to get done? There is no real need to have customer service on that site if you are doing things properly. 
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:27:43
bitcoin is a decentralized online currency that allows you to transfer money with little to no cost and can be transferred anonymously as well as save vendors who accept bitcoin the fees it would otherwise pay credit card companies. It has a set supply of 22 million bitcoins so its value will rise rapidly if it gains wide acceptance and protects you against issues such as inflation caused by the government recklessly printing money. 
@_date: 2013-05-02 21:04:50

I am not against donating by anymeans but this arguement is complete irrelevant.

a good thing about the wealthy top 100 are that they are wealthy because of bitcoin. natural human instincts would indicate that they have a bit of respect for the system and would not just fire sale all of their coins and screw up the price. 
just my 2 cents though 
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:37:47
all 400,000 shares are already owned and they said no more shares will be created so there wont be dilution. A lot of the shares are privately owned so if more are coming onto the open market, they are not new shares, they are just current owners selling theirs.
@_date: 2013-06-17 03:57:15
lol I knew someone would say this. I think north America drives a huge portion of the market and price. 
@_date: 2013-12-28 00:02:57

of course it needs to rise for it to be efficient. if there is only 12 billion worth of bitcoins..that is not enough value to handle the amount of money needed to be moved if bitcoin because a major payment system. 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:10:21
its all based on market size. if bitcoins market cap becomes 100 billion instead of the 8 or whatever billion it is right now. even 100 price swings will be less than 1% change in price. 1% swings is small, still more than what the canadian US currency conversions change on a daily basis but would be considered fairly stable

@_date: 2013-11-29 18:23:19
or they will take out money slowly because they dont think this is a short term bubble. as others jump on with their own small amounts they fill in the void of these large investors taking out earnings. 
Them helping with growth isnt a bad thing. they also dont find a money tree and rape it dry and go back to their 10-15% gains per year on other investments. If they can stay in bitcoin and just keep making large gains they will. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 19:10:21
thanks! ill watch each week to try to take advantage of this
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:06:19
also tracking gains and losses and if they take their fee in coins then the business model would not rely on any banks and therefor would avoid the issues that exchanges are having with their bank accounts being shut down. 
I agree with what you are saying about indemnifying the users but people are usually ok with giving info to reputable websites so if getting some personal info is what it takes to make this work im sure the people who would benefit from this service would be ok giving up the info. Most people who are extra private about their finances are usually also the ones ok storing their own funds.

just googled how much is spend in ecommerce yearly and it says 256,000,000,000 in 2011 which was up 15% from 2010 so I can only imagine what it is now. a 10th of that would be 25.6 trillion i believe instead of 13 billion but maybe this number is including all kinds of other transactions? Im not sure if im missing something here.

who gives who first when you meet in a starbucks or whatever? Do you grab their money before you give the coins? WHat if you send the coins and they just run away?
@_date: 2013-12-12 00:18:28
nice! How come she doesnt set up an account with bitpay to accept bitcoin a lot easier? 
@_date: 2013-06-05 18:38:37
when difficulty increases does that means less coins are created per day or is it still 25 every 10 minutes? 
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:50:58
thats literally not possible as the highest price in the last few days is .001 and the lowest price is .0005.
That means the max you could have made is 2X your money... and you would have had to time it perfectly.
Why you gotta lie?
@_date: 2013-04-29 19:33:17
haha yea i guess there will always be issues. It will be exciting to see what comes next as far as safely storing your coins/
@_date: 2013-11-13 22:57:24
dont fully cash out. you just got 5K profit for nothing. maybe just take out 7500 and leave 2500. it will be worth 5K in a couple months :P
@_date: 2013-05-23 20:05:13
then you are fluking out and you are telling people this is a stock to make money on but really you are fully day trading this stock. Most people dont have time for that and it usually doesnt work out the way you apparently have done in the last half a day. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 00:02:08
im probably going to keep putting every dollar i earn towards asicsminer stock lol. fairly sure no other bitcoin related stocks are showing that kind of growth. 
@_date: 2013-05-29 23:39:07
i thought these cost 1.99 bitcoins?? that price is a pretty big mark up. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 21:59:06
Also i saw this reddit post today and noticed they got the word out really quickly and did a massive press release. You could message the opp and ask what his tactics were for getting this information out to everyone so quickly. 
@_date: 2013-10-25 23:47:12
pretty sure it went like this... if you tell us your keys we will minimize your sentence...
@_date: 2013-04-29 18:24:33
people put money onto exchanges all the time so the concept would be almost identical to starting up an exchange. I actually think this concept would be much safer as the bank would keep most of the money in paper wallets because there wouldnt be the need for constant easy access to the funds to buy and sell bitcoins. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 23:33:43
i really am tired of these posts because they never seem true and i just get inspired to lash out. I havent seen 1 "im cashing out" post without some extremely hard to believe facts.
for this post: 
1) Why would you cash out all of your coins? Leave a few if you believe it will keep going up.
2) basically any amount of money invested last year would mean you are very well off from bitcoin right now. another reason to leave some in there. If you invested $1000 even you would have somewhere around $80K maybe more. You buying them 80K gifts? 
@_date: 2013-04-12 23:30:07
its about awareness. if people follow his lead and diversify and include bit coin investment in the equation its a good thing. He didnt say its a quick buck he said its a long term thing for this to catch on. Its perfect publicity combined with perfect investing advice.

what do those big buy orders lead to though not sure how it affects price other than to stop it from going down. Can it potentially push price up ?

they can adjust fees i believe. also they need to exist so people keep mining otherwise everyone would quit mining once there are no new coins to be mined.

@_date: 2013-04-24 20:44:10
i just charge 5% flat fee they dont know what your exchange fee is at so that is more lucritive if you are able to buy with low exchange fees.
@_date: 2013-05-03 19:22:00
I wrote that trading should be similar or more as time goes on as bitcoin is becoming more well known. multiply the 30 days by 12 and you get my number.... NOT INCLUDING OTHER CURRENCY TRADING. If you honestly think 20 million revenue is a better estimate than my math you are insane
@_date: 2013-04-18 22:32:54
ya im not spending any at the moment so im not too worried and i have it backed up. I hope they can find a way to defend against this though! Ps arent hackers supposed to appreciate the idea of bitcoin not trying to destroy all related sites with DDoS attacks?
@_date: 2013-05-17 20:52:25
all they are doing is mining coins so it shouldnt affect prices. Technically the more coins the lower value per coin so they are doing the opposite. 
Adoption of bitcoin is faster than the mining though so thats why price doesn't slowly go down. 
@_date: 2013-11-22 17:44:28

@_date: 2013-05-03 18:17:59
Is there volume in the last 30 days not 593,163,567? Based on mtgox USD only. I think they have a lot more trades in other currencies based on bitcoincharts.com Dont they make around .5% on average for trades?
I may be missing something but wouldnt that mean revenue just from that USD amount above is $35,589,746 in the last 30 days?

i guess thats fair.
I didnt know class action implied that, i though it was just when people got together to sue. Not that a few people get together to sue and make it public and then anyone affected could jump on the bandwagon

@_date: 2013-05-23 04:08:24
based on just mining yes that is the value but they should be able to keep releasing new generation equipment and sell old. Plus with the value of the company they can probably expand their business as time goes on into other fields.

asicminer is taking most of the money that usually goes into dividends and using it for product developement. There are supposed to be some mass production of product to be sold in october and november. If you can wait I believe they will go back up then when dividends start blowing up. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:59:11
you can eat with 1900 bitcoins cashed out lol. dont be silly. people who get rich from a smart investment dont just pull the plug 100% when they are up so much, it makes more sense to leave a bit. there is no indication that this current price will be the peak. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:44:36
also argue that you dont need to put lots of money into bitcoin in hope to make gains on your money. It is working as a currency right now better than it being an investment. The fact prices are slowly rising now that its stable is just a bonus

i dont see why they wouldnt adjust again. for the next few years it is great to have a close reference point to regular currency. Paying .0000024 for a coffee just gets confusing. now its 2.4 mBTC. its not just to make it seem like bitcoins are cheaper it creates a reference point that is easier to comprehend.

@_date: 2013-05-17 23:50:54
my worry is that you would only need to sell 3 shares right now to lower price to 1.8 but on btct.ca you need to sell around 45 shares to lower the price to 1.8.
Mind you I havent looked often so maybe this is a one off? I just want to go long and forget about this altogether so I just want to make sure I dont tune back in a year from now and not be able to sell my shares.

Hey Locksley,
Are you trying to get some news articles to write about tippercoin because I feel like this is revolutionary and needs to be talked about on more than just reddit. 
@_date: 2013-08-28 06:16:57
tech savvy buyers may want to cash out of bitcoin without having to go through a bank as well so they will get business from those types. Also anyone too lazy to set up an account with an exchange. especially when price is rising. In Canada to create an account and get money in it can take a week or more, their fee is much smaller than waiting a week to buy yourself if prices are climbing. 
@_date: 2013-12-27 23:40:30
are you talking about credit cards? Because it is not you as the customer that pays this 3% fee. Its the vendor. Not sure if you know what you're talking about. Im not going to downvote you but i dont believe you know where these savings are going. its the vendor not you as a customer. 
@_date: 2013-10-29 21:55:19

jsut found a better website that says total world eccomerce B2C volume is 1,221,000,000,000 for 2014. 10% of that would be 122,100,000,000. I dont understand how bitcoin could handle that much volume per year if you consider all the people using it for other reasons, holding it, coins lost etc.
The value would have to be MUCH higher than it is now for that to be anywhere close to possible. 
Ok thats the best I can do with my inexperience lol.

@_date: 2013-08-29 21:16:30
this was in april or whatever when everyone was flocking to bitcoin and then the only way that people know how to cash in and cash out stopped working so people panicked and sold. Also people who knew what was going on sold thinking they could buy in lower and therefor further dropping price.
mt. gix went down a bunch of times after that but people were used to it so it didnt affect price.  
@_date: 2013-06-12 17:18:29
couldnt agree more
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:09:55
ya there is some seriously failed logic because if bitcoin was used for 10% of global B2C transactions there would definitely not be enough bitcoin to go around if it was only worth $1100 a coin.

it probably wont do much until mt gox announces if they will be bringing back US withdrawals. the current price drops to me feel like its because no new people are buying coins because they are waiting to see what happens. THe price drop is from mined coins coming quicker than new people buying coins.

yes but 10% of B2C transactions per day is most likely much more than 13 billion. or atleast so much that it would not be possible for those same 13 billion worth of coins to make all the transactions.

i think they added an extra step by whats actually being transacted being a coupon so that they can prevent the chargeback problem?
Looks like they are charging a huge markup though..

come onto mt gox! Or virtex! 
@_date: 2013-11-01 19:17:35
@_date: 2013-11-07 00:39:32
its because of the 1.75 million dollar wall on gox stopping price from going up. without that wall the price would probably be its normal 10 bucks ish higher
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:22:50
also dont forget there was a massive screw up at mt gox exchange which started a crash and got followed up by US income tax day on monday which im sure lots of people had to take money out to pay their taxes. Even I put around 4K i had saved for income tax to try to double it within a couple weeks before it became due. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 06:42:41
at current prices the dividends are at an extremely high percentage of the stock price so its not as much of a speculation as youd think.

they can update bitcoin to include any needed changes you dont need to start a new coin
@_date: 2013-06-05 19:51:29
400,000 shares X 2.5 per share. more like 100 million 
@_date: 2013-04-26 22:18:33
the only one where this works it btw-e and they its a russian exchange.. the rest are usually darn close to mt gox

a quote from the same person says that bartering is technically allowed in china using bitcoin right now because the government has not specified. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 18:32:02
was this posted on may 6th? seems like its not a big deal if noone mentioned until today?
@_date: 2013-11-27 07:44:37
its actually 7% fee and the cost to convert from Canadian to us to buy from bitstamp is another 5%. not as bad as you think. Try loading an exchange, $50 fee, 4 day wait time, then another fee to buy coins. That is going to be a hell of a lot higher than 20% with the way prices are moving these days. once it settles down im sure the fees will too. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 00:25:48
i couldnt send them a message?
 
@_date: 2013-11-29 19:48:11
I dont think it would hurt if bitcoin black friday goes well. they could just say,for our X amount of clients we processed X amount in total sales during X time period.

whats your problem the guy is correct that the average daily price hasnt moved much lately

can someone please explain what this site is? 
@_date: 2013-11-22 00:09:13
got 10 bucks woo
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:43:40
id probably start with the fact that major venture capitalist money is being put into bitcoin with many VC's having faith in bitcoin success. for instance, the person who first invested in twitter put 5 million into a thing called coinbase last week which converts coins to currency for people looking to accept bitcoins for their businesses
that takes away the risk of crash for businesses. 
Maybe also talk about gyft who now accepts coins so people can actually use bitcoin to buy from big companies. 
@_date: 2013-12-24 06:34:18

@_date: 2013-05-09 19:48:57
dont you guys realize that people with a ton of bitcoin dont want to be loading exchanges and sending money to their bank accounts in large amounts? Much safer to just buy gift cards here and there!! not to mention most banks get suspecious when money keeps getting wired into your account. especially large amounts. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 01:50:33
Are you saying this wil cause prices to drop?
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:57:39
ok then i may believe you lol. i just see so many people saying they are cashing all their coins out because they think its time. if you really did become a millionaire because of bitcoin then it would make sense to leave some in because there is obviously more potential. not to mention id feel obligated to atleast keep a little bit of skin in the game.

people keep saying bear market but with bitcoin any major retailer hopping on bored or large start up company could send prices skyrocketing in days.

@_date: 2013-05-03 22:05:16
there are so many things that could throw the btc price trends completely out of wack though. This works if you are comparing pure speculation but if something like ebay accepts bitcoin or government makes it illegal it completely throws any comparisons out the window.
@_date: 2013-04-15 19:12:04
It was actually the fact that I couldnt load my exchange account quick enough and people on some online groups I was in were begging for coins so I just decided to sell some of mine. I also felt like there would be a correction so I felt ok doing this as I didnt believe it would keep going up 20% a day lol. 
@_date: 2013-05-21 03:10:17
id be carefulk with your logic if you are trying to make some money in bitcoin as I believe this stock is extremely under priced. anything that pays over 2 % dividend in a week will most likely slowly increase in value until that percent is much lower. Just dont hold out based on it being a 0 sum game and then regret it later. Coins can be mined for another 127 years !

Dont forget guys that technology will significantly increase over time so I think they will make more money from selling higher end units as time goes on. We get portions of ALL company revenues paid in dividends.

I agree. I wish that chart was better and I could find out how large the spike actually was on the day they started accepting bitcoins and how long that surge sticks around for. Perfect market data to send to other vendors you want to accept bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-05-09 21:00:46
who cares? its not artificial if people who own bit coin can purchase all of these great every day items. 
Once Gyft reports how much extra business they are getting im sure people will realize that if they accept bitcoin they can benefit in the same way.

their company could understand sales will be low while market grows and price is constantly rising. they still pay 1% to bitpay instead of 3%to visa. They would have to do it out of spite towards bitcoin.

they could also use an alt coin for tiny transactions. like bitcoin would be your savings and used for big transactions and an alt coin could be your pocket change for fast small transactions. you can transfer btc to alt coin basically instantly.

they are 18500 per unit... they bought 5 of them. Get your facts staight before you talk trash. They make around 5% per transaction as well so after $370,000 in transactions either from cash to bitcoin or bitcoin to cash they break even. 
This can easily happen within a couple months.
@_date: 2013-12-13 23:04:26
because by 2140 if bitcoin still exists it will be on a massive scale and i think the security and ease of use and purchase would be so advanced that it would just be a better way to pay for things. 
@_date: 2013-11-28 17:31:31

why don't they just buy a ton of bitcoin and then announce it is legal they would allocate a similar percentage of the wealth to themselves as thye currently have with fiat
@_date: 2013-05-22 17:32:30
i think the best comparison for this investment is holding bitcoin vs holding ASICMINER stock. I wouldnt say buying a bunch of bitcoin just to get these stocks is such a good idea because of what you said but if you are holding bitcoin you may as well put a portion of it in these stocks as your worry about bitcoin value dropping is irrelevant in this scenario.

THat is 35,589,746 based on a year so 20 million is farrr off unless you think that is close? And im not including any mt.gox trading in other currencies which would bring it over the 35.589 mill.

everyone sell now! lol
@_date: 2013-05-23 19:44:25
i dont think thats high enough for a bubble based on current steady prices. It was 170 last time when stable prices were much lower. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 16:36:24
hahaha no doubt. i actually was just anti hyping the company so i could get cheap shares since everyone seems to not know how to think for themselves and panic sells happen at the drop of a dime lol

great update thanks for keeping everyone informed. I really hope this limits the new posts about bitinstant that is tarnishing this reddit right now.

Thank you! I look forward to watching it :)

you need bitcoins to get those shares! depends where you are from in regards to buying bit coins

@_date: 2013-12-23 22:15:25
even send us the public address so we can see 2000 coins lo. ur just a straight up troll why do you think everyone is giving you a hard time? 
@_date: 2013-05-16 17:15:45
I have already invested through bitfunder. Is there any reason I should be using a different site or am I good to go? I am just contemplating if I want to invest a large portion of my coins and want to make sure its a good investment
any insight? 
@_date: 2013-06-26 18:47:25
go for it but the relevance is only to you. Id say 70% of the people on this reddit have asicminer shares. 
@_date: 2013-05-23 18:57:43
nope. mining does not affect price. some people may just cash out their shares to bitcoins too right. it would be very minor even if it affected it at all
@_date: 2013-05-21 21:29:45
ahh ok i just read your post wrong, (rushing)
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:16:55
hope not lol
@_date: 2013-05-17 19:17:37
that doesnt make sense does it? It is a 100th of a full share how can it all of a sudden be 2% of a full share? 
@_date: 2013-05-23 03:19:03
It is most definitely worth more based on dividends. Why should a few people have thousands of these shares and make hundreds off dividends each week? If price going up is a bi product of more people getting in on these dividends then that is totally legitimate. Id say until shares are worth 10 bitcoins a share they are worth it.  Over the last 2 weeks dividends are .05706564 per share. Multiple that by 26 to get a full year thats 1.4837 coins per share. At 10 dollars per share that is still 14.8% return which is much higher than most mature market dividend shares. 
@_date: 2013-05-13 19:07:34
well what is the negative feedback? May help us form a rebuttal 
@_date: 2013-10-31 23:28:21
i think enough new people will dip into the market with small purchases and it will inevitably increase the price. also big players like wallstreet investors etc aint scared to buy at 200 if they believe it will go up. they should be hopping on board soon
@_date: 2013-11-07 06:45:52
im buying I see 33% increase in a day I know a good opportunity when I see one but ill just get out in a few days to be safe
@_date: 2013-05-16 18:21:12
oh nice. That shit CRAY!
@_date: 2013-11-29 20:46:20
lower highs? pretty sure we reach a new high every day.

this makes me happy.

i agree i just sat there watching for 5 minutes and it sounds like a downsyndrom gang bang 
@_date: 2013-07-04 18:06:39
Using millibits as the standard denomination is a good idea. I think it will be more likely they purchase small amounts of coins this way
@_date: 2013-05-03 04:15:39
do you support the idea to sell some of your coins to try to buy in a bit lower? quickest way to get money on the exchange/
@_date: 2013-11-12 17:59:14
a bunch of my friends bought at $250 exactly. They wanted it so bad I sold them from my stash so when it crashed the next day and they were down and I had sold the coins to them they were absolutely livid. I convinced them not to sell and really explained bit coins benefits above and beyond that of an investment. They kept the coin and now they are texting me every day saying how stoked they are that the price keeps going up.
@_date: 2013-05-21 17:15:54
i want one! 
@_date: 2013-11-19 00:31:52
i think its because a lot of people found it hard to hold on through these insane increase. lots of early people but thinks like pizza for excessive amounts of bitcoin. also a lot of people probably cashed out along the way shrinking their stash. I think maybe around 2,000-5,000 millionaires as an estimate. some of those being excessively rich beyond a million. 
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:06:56
ill be coming by with 1 mill to test that theory..
@_date: 2013-06-13 16:56:41
fair enough. But yes I just mean that people make mistakes, i can think of a major screw up by basically any large corporation off the top of my head. PS: Are people getting their money from Bitinstant yet? 
@_date: 2013-11-05 06:08:02
I always thought the QR code that generates a 6 digit code that is needed to log in was 2-FA??? If I am wrong what is thing I am referring to? and should I have both the phone thing and the 6 digit code generator?

@_date: 2013-06-11 21:08:52
ya im pretty sure it was a lie and they were just trying to get attention or hurt Gox rep. 
@_date: 2013-11-21 20:07:54
it usually goes down friday afternoon stays low over the weekend then blasts up early week because of all the new money hitting the exchanges. 
@_date: 2013-06-11 23:43:17
Go here 
@_date: 2013-05-30 17:19:41
those are different. 
@_date: 2013-12-10 18:59:56
the problem is the block size. only so many transactions can fit into a block which is solved every 10 minutes (estimated). If too many transactions happen in that time frame some cannot be processed on that block and there for they are pushed back to the next block. If volumes get so high without bitcoin figuring a way to grow the block size then other coins will be needed to take away some of the transaction volume. 
In the above scenario something like litecoin would be good as like the pocket change to bitcoins savings accounts etc. Good for making small purchases like coffee etc. 
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:12:20
excuse me? Im not saying it doesnt suck but every time it happens its forcing the bitcoin related sites to up their game. Do you not understand that? 
@_date: 2013-04-19 23:14:05
I have also been able to take money out from the site with ease. Why do you need to speak with them to do that??? 
@_date: 2013-12-10 22:31:17
also! tell her superiors 
@_date: 2013-07-05 20:11:11
ya i pulled out of those once i started seeing people panic selling bitcoins, i knew the stocks would drop right behind it.
@_date: 2013-05-21 23:45:45
lots of rich bitcoiners they are more of a fun item than anything
@_date: 2013-11-30 00:04:34
isnt their system down from too much volume? lol
@_date: 2013-06-11 20:04:56
I think this is pretty cool! 
@_date: 2013-12-11 20:01:55
there has literally been over 50 articles posted on this reddit about this jp morgan bs.
its not even real either, they renewed a patent that they had from 1999 or something like that. it maybe had like 2 things in common with bitcoin so its pretty irrelevant. 
@_date: 2013-12-20 20:36:43
also you are cherry picking info. If you're complaining that you can lose your money so quickly then you may as well consider that you could have bought for 450 a day and a half ago and could have sold at $773.

@_date: 2013-04-19 23:14:56
these exchanges have people calling and emailing non stop asking stupid things like why is there lag or why are the markets so volatile etc. Its understandable for the small exchanges to have trouble getting back to everyone. 
@_date: 2013-05-03 16:30:22
less liquidity. people probably sell when prices are headed down most of the time so in those situations you would want someone to buy the coins off you instantly so the price doesnt go down even more.
aka if the price drops more than .5% when you are trying to sell then it doesnt matter that the fee is so low.
@_date: 2013-11-07 20:03:47
prices need to go way up so that a 10 dollar increase or decrease in its value is not a big deal. 
@_date: 2013-05-22 22:34:04
sorry i mean like no extra tranaction fees. cant you pay a bit extra to make things confirm quicker? PS your explanation is more correct though I was just guessing haha
@_date: 2013-06-25 21:38:59
if they can make them for cheap then they can do both. They dont want to go over around 30% of the total network so they can produce enough themselves to stay at that level but then they can also gain revenue from selling ASIC's to other people. 
@_date: 2013-06-05 22:17:35
not to mention the dividends are paid in coins so if prices go back up to 130+ we wont have skipped a beat. Getting that 9% drop would have been next to impossible and even if you saw the drop your saying you would have sold right before the drop and bought back at the very end of the drop. And you didnt consider the fees required to buy and sell coins on most sites adding up to more than .65% combined.
@_date: 2013-05-21 19:23:29
cause their share price would drop by a shit load and the money they saved in dividend payout would be much less than the affect on the share price of which they own most of. 
@_date: 2013-05-14 17:18:16
id like to think that 10 grand would be worth stealing by now! but thank you for making me even more paranoid!

@_date: 2013-04-19 18:50:52
so far so good. i bet lots of people didnt even notice it went down. no server lag right now either and i didnt see any lag prior to so maybe they had to just take it down for a minute for an update?
@_date: 2013-04-18 01:21:36
markets mature so they get less and less prone to this and also more and more people get into bitcoin with less and less of their total net worth so expect each dip to be less fierce. 
@_date: 2013-12-23 22:14:47
your edit is just more trolling lol 
@_date: 2013-07-17 22:47:21

@_date: 2013-05-15 20:56:58
thanks for the message I found out how it works. Dont worry about the auto reinvestment. It wouldnt rebuy a share until you have enough to buy a full share and the ones I bought are 1.7 bitcoins so that would be months before it auto rebought.
the dividends goes into a wallet on bitfunder and is deposited on fridays. If you buy shares before the dividend is given you will get that whole weeks dividend even if you bought that same day. 
With your dividends its best to just reivest them yourself into those 100/th of an asics shares that are also on bitfunder. 
hope that helps!

@_date: 2013-11-21 20:18:24
it will soon enough. bad news overall but not bad news for bitcoins longevity or for bitcoins value. taxing it means it will work its way into mainstream. 
@_date: 2013-05-17 21:07:15
people who bought shares during the IPO got 5000 for 6 grand. They sell the passthrough shares to make money and then when you own the passthrough shares you get 100% of the dividends that are paid to that real share.
@_date: 2013-06-27 05:06:15

its up to 1.8 now I think. I bought another 10 shars after our talk as well so im pretty stoked. Its massively underpriced if you compare it to any other dividend paying stock in the world. (or atleast most)
@_date: 2013-05-13 06:22:03
Because there isnt much wrong with bitcoin. THere just needs to be more companies taking away the risk to the consumer like a bitcoin bank that insures your coins so they cant be stolen etc.
If they issued a new language in america everyone would just stick with english. Same idea. Its the most well known with the most infrastructure. It just makes sense to work on it rather than other coins.

@_date: 2013-12-19 00:45:27
ur fine just dont sell, i feel like you must have known that you could lose it all but you are far from that point if you just leave it for a while. i dont see another big drop in price coming, everyone has panicked and now are seeling the light at the end of the tunnel in that there is other potential with bitcoin above and beyond a china bubble.

hah sorry i was rushing through no offense I didnt read every word but coinbase is partially ran by people who have dealt with all these laws. Most of the other start ups based in America have people with experience in this as well. 
@_date: 2013-12-11 19:54:43
big time. i think it could happen but the proper licensing is millions of dollars. I could be wrong but I think that is what is holding things back. although it may be even worse than that and companies just simply cannot put atms in public.
