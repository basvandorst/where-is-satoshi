I think we need to remember that bitcoin is global. The dollar is fairly weighted globally. I don't think its weighted enough to directly compete with every other countries currency directly as a pool. They would have to seriously sway the perception of A LOT of people all at one time to make this happen. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:14:30
It is. I meant that in your case you would cash out 1k, 850 being profit.

I believe it. I paid cash for last semesters college tuition $3,011.00 for 15 credits at a community college in Minnesota. They offered me a student loan for $24,823.00.
Edit: I file my taxes by myself and my parents don't claim me as a dependent.
@_date: 2017-12-03 07:07:03
I think its 20k in total profit gained across the board of all investments? I'm not a tax professional.

A different group is starting on the 10th. Technically Sunday night. 10th will be first full day.

How ever long it take for bitcoin to be around 120k per coin to be worth $1000. That's not profit either. Just cashing out for 1k.

I feel like I saw something a hand full of months back. Something like 22 million. I can't find the article. This could be completely a misunderstanding. I should have rephrased the question. It was intended to be for a clarification.

That's why I said "essentially". Now think logically for a second. People take loans all the time. The ones who are suckers are those who do it without a plan. Taking a loan to buy bitcoin would be risky. Taking a loan to start a business you have a plan for and are passionate is not stupid at all. Do you think every business is owned free in clear? I don't have real facts on this but I would estimate there is less than 1% of businesses that operate without some form of debt or another.

I did see a new ICO that is working on this. It mediates as a trust less escrow service, it is one of the only shitcoins I have interest in at the moment. This is because it isn't trying to be bitcoin it is more of a service that you can use bitcoin on. (I forget what its called if someone has the name that would be great. The white paper was very  intriguing) 
@_date: 2017-08-14 16:50:42
There isn't technically an account. Unless you, yourself make a monumental mistake the likes of your trezor being "hacked" is close to impossible.
@_date: 2017-08-15 17:38:04
If you send it and technically don't make a profit, I.e. take in only the amount you put in for the purchase, you pay nothing in taxes.
@_date: 2017-08-13 19:38:43
That's not funny that is being smart. A super low interest rate from a bank would be essentially "free" money compared to the ultimate loss that would be had in selling based off the trend we are on now. 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:44:30
Just read the whitepaper

Call me paranoid but I use a simple excel spreadsheet. I don't like the idea of an app with many permissions and possible trading apps being on the same device.
@_date: 2017-01-02 15:48:32
Being that bitcoins get lost forever when someone "loses their key" would it matter if the IRS found everything out? Any money that is used to purchase bitcoin right now is already taxed before purchase. Wouldn't it work like a Roth? You technically could only get taxed on your gains when you sell. But how about claiming a loss? How would they ever be able to prove that it wasn't lost? And then you could just allocate your money to a different currency? I feel like the IRS would bury itself if it jumped in and actually tried to gain full control of this.

That's not true. The coins aren't actually stored on the trezor. I could light my trezors on fire right now and still use my coins freely.
@_date: 2017-08-06 20:37:10
Yes I ordered from them, every thing appears to be the same as my original purchase. They shipped the same day and everything about the box and actual device seemed to be untampered with. Re flash the trezor and update and everything was in good order.

I feel one of the most important things as an individual in this came is awareness. We can't control price fluxuations, fork threats or any other geographical or political speed bump. Fiat to me is a come and go thing and it can be perceived as safe in a delusional way. You have these delusional  insurances under the FDIC and you can claim bankruptcy and come out relatively unscathed if you make a big mistake. Bitcoin mistakes are always the individuals fault. If shit goes south. No one is going to bail you out with free coins. Let your guard down and misplace a paper wallet or recovery and no one is hurt but you. Your the protector of your own coins. Before I ever move any amount of coin I always triple check why, what, and where I am moving them. One letter or number in an address and those coins dissapear.

Relax. Aldo remember that fees aren't percentage based either. Should have sent more coin for the same fee.

Its not really stolen. What if I were to ask "how much money do you have in your bank account? I'm making a new currency and matching you one to one. I will distribute it to you personally if you have cash, or leave it up to the bank to distribute what they are holding onto."
Pretty sure the bank would tell you to get bent as that wasn't the original scope of their business model.

I've always understood that satoshi has tons of addresses with 50 coins. I am pretty sure in the white paper he states you should NEVER use a single address fr more than one transaction. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 16:35:23
Yeah you should buy now. 40% ganins usually signal it should do the same again today.

I do understand why people mine crypto to make less than a dollar a day. Blows my mind

Yes under the transfer/deposit tab on the top right of the desktop page
@_date: 2017-10-21 15:53:16
What ever you need to tell yourself. That 24 hours of electricity used to accumulate that dollar would be worth arguably more if you kept buying. (I'm figuring around 215 dollars a year to run a basic PC non stop) if you would have spent that 215 around the 3k/coin mark you would not stress the PC for 1 minute even and still be in the black if you sold right now
@_date: 2017-10-18 13:35:43
I would suggest sitting on them since you have made it this far. I would pull out your 8 bch that I assume you still have available for spending/fun money.

If you connected your bank account to coinbase you can buy 2k weekly at default and can apply to increase that limit

Sell the cheap shity side of the split and claim total loss on my coins to irs. Then be completely off any radars. 
Edit: in all seriousness if you are never noted on paper to have purchased the "extra" coins unless you have the money wired from an exchange their is virtually no possible way for this to be tracked.

Another possibility, to bad there wouldn't have been some strange way to block chain our identity into a safe place to register as a miner in someway that would prevent the capitalization of mining as a business and kept the users in control. I guess a question could be this.. If everyone was forced to mine their own transactions would we benefit as a whole?
@_date: 2017-06-28 00:03:28
the Bette question would be to find out if the company you wish to purchase from updates their cost and when the price of the product is determined
You can buy 24/7 365 no open no close

I understand the incentive to mine in crypto currency I'm just trying to start a conversation. Do you have any ideas on a possible "pre-patch" that could have kept miners from essentially governing transaction cost as they do now?
@_date: 2017-06-28 17:58:06
If I am not mistaken I believe it is pretty heavily regulated. In america I believe you need federal licensing and each individual state you conduct business in needs some sort of licensing. (I.e. people who live in Minnesota aren't allowed to trade on gdax without some sort of workaround)
@_date: 2017-06-26 00:44:24
I know that It would be very difficult/impossible but bitcoin is pretty complex in itself. I guess I am trying to understand is this... Do you think satoshi would have ever predicted miners centralizing the crypto world and if so why don't you think he (it,they) didn't somehow prevent it?

If you leave your coins sit there is a good chance that in 2-5 years even if the price just starts recovering you will have made more money than the interest lost on inflation in a savings count
