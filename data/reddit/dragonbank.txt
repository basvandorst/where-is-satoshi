On a publicly traded company not on bitcoin.

Well that open sucked...
@_date: 2017-08-14 21:25:00
Except I am up 468 percent in 6 trading days.

It is based off of shares like any other publicly traded stock but because most of their profit comes from mining, exchange, and proprietary trading value they are also based off of cryptocurrency value. Since they don't work with any fiat currency if crypto were to fail they would be useless.

I will probably be holding. This isn't just some worthless penny stock. They are almost at a 1 billion dollar evaluation and have a proprietary use that no else has. They are working in a market no other public company is in, and no company, private or public, has it all in one package. I'm not going to pretend I know there actual worth but if they could do what they have the potential to do they could outsize paypal. The key to that is can they do it or will they fall apart.

Thanks my man. You might have joined the ship late but I think we are all riding the same ship to the moon.

Obviously you meant futuristicly. As in next week when BTC hit 1,000,000 USD.

Not to spoil your party but I got in at .41
@_date: 2017-08-15 08:33:09
I'll probably comment again at market open.

You said bitcoin is a better investment than any publicly traded company but I just said the publicly traded company I bought into is up 468% in 6 days which absolutely demolishes the bitcoin ROI.
