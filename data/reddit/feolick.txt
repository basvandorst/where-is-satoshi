Yes, use a wallet where you control your own seed &amp; private keys
Coinbase is a custodial account, so if another fork happens, you won't be able to receive any of the altcoin

No, depending on the cost of living in your area, $400 a month could be a lot or very little. For instance in places such as SF, or NY, $400 a month would not even cover rent. I don't know how much your salary compares to the cost of living in Turkey, but as long as you can cover what you need, budgeting the remainder for fun items/investments is entirely at your own discretion.

Not sure how much your salary can get you, depends on what you can get in your country. In the US, most people would barely survive off of 400 a month.
As long as you can properly budget and manage your money without dying I guess you're good

You will need a better PC cooler if your i7 is hitting 86C, something is wrong with your PC setup if you're hitting temps at 86C consistently
@_date: 2017-12-01 20:06:28
newegg, microcenter, amazon, bequiet has good pc coolers, cooler master, thermaltake

Depends on which bank you use, but most of the time there's a delay from a several day to a week as the funds get transferred.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:38:26
If you're bad at timing the market, dollar cost averaging is your friend
@_date: 2017-11-28 23:52:57
You should only invest what you are willing to lose. Bitcoin is very volatile, and there's always the likelihood you could lose everything.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:49:37
You can sell your bitcoin on coinbase and then transfer the USD to your bank account. Keep in mind though the IRS has been hounding coinbase for a while, so I'd recommend paying the capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:39:33
be aware of phishing sites though
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:42:55
does your transaction show up on the blockchain? if so ledger has sent your transaction details to the network, and chances are it's just delayed.
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:01:31
not necessarily, however you can report a capital loss. IRS has ranges on how much you have to lose before you can claim tax loss harvesting and have it still be worthwhile, i.e. a loss of $1 probably isn't going to particularly make that much of a difference
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:37:31
when you connect the device to the chrome wallet, ledger runs a test to see if the firmware has been tampered with, hence no need for an antitamper sticker.
You don't need to break open the device to prove it hasn't been tampered with, but you should be ok. As u/Peylix mentioned to be safe you can reset it several times to make sure its safe.

For bitcoin to achieve it's original purpose, it has to be more than just a store of value, has to be used in purchases for it to really have value.  But yeah it sucks, not as bad as the 10k BTC pizza though
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:34:27
I would also recommend moving any crypto you have in your coinbase account to a wallet you have control over the private keys for (such as Electrum), makes it easier to recover any crypto you have locked up in coinbase.
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:26:41
Yes, your USD in coinbase is FDIC protected up to $250k.
@_date: 2017-11-29 23:33:31
IRS counts every time that you sell as a taxable event, so yes you would still need to pay taxes
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:43:55
It's probably not ledger's fault, ledger doesn't process transactions. Chances are your transaction is stuck somewhere in the queue of transactions waiting to get confirmed, just wait for a while.  If it takes longer than 3 days, then I'd say you might have a problem. Most cases though with low fees transactions get confirmed within 12 hrs.
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:06:17
Check out the whitepapers at bitcoin.org, should get you started. Most newcomers get an account and wallet at coinbase, where you can buy bitcoin and store it, although I'd advise you eventually move your funds into a wallet you own the keys for (coinbase is a custodial account)
@_date: 2017-11-29 18:25:39
Yes, you want to move the coins out of coinbase (which is a custodial account). Electrum is a good choice for starters, the main thing you want to do is control your private keys, which Electrum can help with
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:16:18
You're probably better off buying bitcoin and holding, unless you're getting free power, have space and cooling for a miner, and have a way to soundproof the room you're putting your miners in it's really not worth it.
That being said, if mining is affordable for you still, ebay, amazon, openbazaar have some miners for sale. You can also buy directly from bitmain if you have bcash, though they are presently out of stock
@_date: 2017-11-28 19:40:10
best way to really understand the core technology
@_date: 2017-11-30 01:07:36
Did you type your address correctly? The network is currently at 90k unconfirmed transactions, so there's also a chance your transaction may yet been processed.
@_date: 2017-11-29 16:01:55
No, you do not. Only if you are on an exchange, then someone is automatically queued for the price you want to sell for but for a direct sell, there is no delay.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:48:51
Start by reading the white papers at bitcoin.org, get a wallet if it sounds promising to you, and proceed from there. Most of the information can be found at the bitcoin foundation page, though be careful since there are phishing attacks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:12:22
Very easy to use, yes very worth it.
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:47:50
Yes, you can check out r/bitmarket or @_date: 2017-11-29 16:33:58
You just multiply 0.1 and 100000...
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:42:10
No way to tell, don't bother trying to time the market with bitcoin, it's better to do dollar cost averaging
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:53:46
The likelihood of cracking or running into a collision with SHA 256 in our lifetimes is low, but for the sake of argument, if SHA256 was cracked, yes, that would impact the bitcoin network, but not in a way we can foretell.  On the other hand, SHA256 is used in a lot of other encryption practices, so I'd be more worried about that.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:24:28
I imagine you already have a wallet, so join a pool, like bitminter, slushpool or nicehash.  Link your asic miners to your address in your pool account and let it run.
@_date: 2017-11-28 15:45:05
you can also call your bank/cc provider to have them to cancel the purchase if it does end up going through, coinbase support tends to be rather slow in response nowadays
@_date: 2017-11-29 14:50:47
Hard to say anything, but definitely don't keep your coins on the exchanges, move them to a wallet you have control over.
@_date: 2017-11-29 15:48:27
localbitcoins, or cryptotrade.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:28:06
yeah bitcoin ain't about that
