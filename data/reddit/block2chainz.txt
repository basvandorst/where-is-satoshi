It's in no manufacturer's best interest to weaken the network like that. 
Now suppose that all miners agree, "okay, we will purposely stop innovating and use weaker tech." 
Big bad evil corporation comes along and decides they want to destroy Bitcoin, so they funnel tens of millions of dollars into building super-efficient chips until they *do* control most of the network. Now all the honest manufacturers are left behind and can't compete because some butthurt bitcoiners decided they don't like technological progress or innovation.
Keeping the network secure with cutting edge hardware *is* the best thing we can do. Maybe KNC is able to have a more competitive hashrate for a while while others catch up -- good! They deserve it for being first to market with the most efficient chip. This is how Bitcoin mining works! This is incentives in action, working as intended.
It's not like KNC stole some super secret alien technology that no one will ever be able to catch up to. 
Also you and Luke seem to be forgetting that there are capital and operational expenditures involved with mining bitcoins. You made an efficient chip? Great! Now, how much efficiency does it lose once it's part of the machine instead of testing a single chip in the lab? How many months do you have to wait for the fab to make your order? Do you have enough money up front to order several wafers? Ok, now where are you going to manufacture your hardware? What is your manufacturing capacity? What if the factory fucks up and you wasted a million dollars? Can you find cheap enough power? Ok, you found cheap enough power, can you find suitable warehouse space nearby to build your farm in? Oh, the warehouse can only house 1 petahash of machinery, now you need more warehouses. Every warehouse needs employees. This isn't so cut and dry as "have good chip, destroy Bitcoin."
Don't be a luddite.

Advertising is a source of ongoing revenue, but years ago forum members donated thousands of bitcoins, which Theymos has been sitting on (and spending $100k a month of) ever since.

Exactly. This happened could lead to accidental hard forks. A planned hard fork is one thing, but an unplanned one could be messy indeed. Thankfully the last time it happened in 2013 it was rectified in a timely manner, but that's no guarantee that a future hard fork wouldn't split the network in two.
@_date: 2015-06-04 12:22:11
Why? What's the point? Bitcoin is an open system and mining runs on free market principles. I can't think of anything that would kill Bitcoin faster than to suddenly break the system just because.... you don't like it?? It's not fair?

I think the argument about accepting bitcoin negatively affecting revenues is overblown. I think the source of this is Mozilla's post where they discovered that by listing too many payment methods on a *donation page* that the amount of money received in donations went down. I think this is largely a matter of page layout and integration. 
Do you think anyone goes through all the trouble of booking a hotel on Expedia, finally gets to the payment page, gets to the credit card payment form, sees the three tabs that say "Credit Card | PayPal | Bitcoin" and goes OMG TOO MANY CHOICES I CAN'T HANDLE IT and cancels out of their order?
@_date: 2015-05-26 04:09:03
I don't get why the people saying that think that Roger should accept it because it's "okay in China", but they apparently don't think that Okcoin, which is trying to be an international company, should be held to international standards of doing business.

There's a difference between running a blog with google ads on it and a high-value domain name like bitcoin.com
It would be monetized not by CPM ads but by referring people to other services.

Lol you realize computers can make billions of guesses a second right?

Wallets should generate extra change outputs (like two instead of one), try to match the size of the outputs (eg, 1.0, .99, and 1.01), and randomize the order of the outputs (eg, .99, 1.01, and 1.0). With that last example it's much harder to know which are the change outputs and which is the main output.

CZ, the guy who signed the contract, basically is an experienced Western executive. He's Chinese, but fluent in English and well familiar with the way western companies operate.
For some reason he abruptly resigned from okcoin earlier in the year, along with their western chief compliance officer and their entire international team. Something seems amiss here.

Go to your local meetups and make friends in the industry. Brainstorm ideas over beers. The opportunities will follow :)

I like the way you're publishing these thoughts. If you wrote one big post, it would be too easy to read it once and move on, or, in my case, read it halfway through before getting distracted and switching tabs.
The way you're doing it now makes it easy to digest point by point and keeps it fresh on the mind. Kudos.

So you think if Larry Summers were offered money to promote cash4gold, or NAMBLA, or Amway, that he would be willing to put his name on it?
I'm sure money is part of the equation, but certainly not the only thing that counts.

Regardless of their motivations, the fact that these well known hard-hitters are willing to attach their names to a Bitcoin company says *something*.
Remember two years ago when it was all made up internet money only used for drugs and money laundering?

You're right. I don't have a link handy but after Nathaniel Popper's article in the NYT about Bitcoin disrupting Argentina's economy, their equivalent to the white house tweeted something sarcastic (to millions of followers lol) like "apparently Bitcoin is disrupting our economy now."

Perhaps someone at the Pink Cow could put OP in touch with some local bitcoiners?

I remember when Bitcoin merely being mentioned in articles on sites like CNBC would be the top story in for the day.
Now established publications like WSJ and FT have dedicated bitcoin columns. How far we've come!

I'm from Argentina. I work as a programmer and many of my clients are overseas. If they pay me via traditional methods, I lose 30% of my payment because of the "official" exchange rate. If I use Bitcoin, I get paid at the real exchange rate. Beneficial use cases already exist.

Come on, that's not really the most fair characterization of Theymos. I'll agree that the forum donation funds may be mismanaged, but Theymos is no thief. 
I've had my share of issues with him over the years, but all in all, he is a very fair, just, and responsible leader in the bitcoin community. Thank god we have someone like theymos moderating the forums and not an authoritarian Garza-type with a ban boner.

The supply of bitcoins will inflate faster and faster until our libertarian magic internet bucks are worth nothing!
For a serious answer: it means that more mining hardware is coming online, and the network is more robust and secure as a result. The higher the network hashrate, the more resources a malicious actor would have to expend to attack the network ([and here's Andreas talking about why it's not even a big issue](

Alt account made just to post this comment? You must be one of the devs.
Anyone who is a public figure is going to have loud, nasty, and rude people who bitch about them. It's tough, really tough even, but you should know that there are plenty more people out there who are incredibly grateful for the work you guys do. I believe you are literally helping to change the world. Keep up the good work.
