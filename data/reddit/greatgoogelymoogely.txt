I did not know those were the main users of tether. 
However, I would not really expect significant reaction to subpoena news at this point especially since news of it has been known of (referring to the warrant canary thing) for a little while.
also about the higher demand- does that not alarm you? in reference to the .5b issued in 1 week.

the more deflationary something is the better store of value it is. because your money, predictably will have the same value when you go to retrieve it. in this case it will probably be more. it is a better store of value than usd for this reason.
I can imagine a situation where it makes sense to save btc rather than spend because of its consistent usd value increase- i suppose I can see that reducing price, by reducing use as currency which is kind of the whole goal here.
bitcoin is deflationary as coins will not be produced over 21m and coins are consistently lost. I think the deflation rate is optimal as any more coins lost would be intentional deflation. and any more coins produced would be inflation, its kind of purely decentralized. Im having trouble putting that into words, and im tired so im probably just rambling.

coinbase seems to be inflated due to increased US volume.
transfer funds to gdax and purchase there for a limit order. gdax/coinbase is the same thing you will save fees. then transfer back to coinbase if you wish.

Most don't "agree" block size should increase. In fact if scaling is done somewhere it will not be by block size.
It is not beneficial for decentralization, increasing the requirement of future nodes.
Second layer solutions will come-

@_date: 2017-12-08 20:52:03
ah i see your comment was updated. ok. so yeah, I think the main thing is that we are at a critical point of congestion. with growing user base the network is becoming difficult to use. I see that scaling is a short term 'fix' that would allow us some room to develop solutions but - personal stance. I don't really care if the network becomes so congested that it takes 20 dollars to make a transaction within a reasonable time. I guess I'm in it for the long run because I know solutions will come.

"The general idea of probabilistic payment is that transactions only
have some low probability of going through, but they have a high payload if they go
through. So instead of Alice paying Bob 1¢, she pays Bob $1 with probability 1/100.
Suddenly, they will only be paying the 5¢ fee once for every 100 transactions. Thus
probabilistic payments do the job of bundling together micropayments to minimize the
amount of overhead work that must be done."

We have a list of devs supporting the 2mb hard fork, here.
None on this list, although I'll agree that the 2x fork in this form was full of alternate agenda.

I think a lot of your perception rests on your belief that the institutions do not own coins. Billions have flown into bitcoin recently- coinbase and others had announcements of institutional accounts. Do you really think that this money has come from "people"?

@_date: 2017-11-29 12:29:03


we have a difficulty adjustment algo. if mining were ever to become not-profitable, miners would be forced to take there systems offline and the difficulty would find equilibrium in respect to efficiency x electricity cost.
In this case I can see a scenario where mining would gravitate to the cheapest electricity (centralizing) - but that would be far into the future and who knows how electricity could evolve by then.
@_date: 2017-11-10 03:52:26
It sounds like keeping a small amount of bitcoin in a ln wallet might be equivalent to a 'checking account'. Doing so would be conducive to the ln ecosystem and would allow us to pay for things with low tx fees.
@_date: 2017-11-12 19:40:28
lol^. BTC price increases are actually fundamental to its use. it is a very good sign were hitting prices this high, adoption is an exponential curve.
I hope users on this forum have their bullshit sorters on high gear at a time like this. Seek knowledge from reliable sources.
@_date: 2017-11-18 21:44:02
ETH is not a fundamentally insecure network, and its not accurate to chalk up all alts to being insecure either.
The losses in ETH were due to bugs in the code  written to utilize Etherium and smart contracts, not to due to any insecurity of the Etherium network.
@_date: 2017-11-14 05:47:56
Why are you spreading misinformation? It is very possible and we will all see. Just as the internet did not have IP addresses for 100 billion devices, bitcoin will scale. Do you realize how many layers are used in displaying this very webpage? We must allow developers the time to create an elegant solution, then bitcoin can be the tool we all want it to be.

This discussion is very important. He very concisely invalidated BCH and its 8mb blocks. in 2 years when usage has grown by 1 order of magnitude, 10mb blocks would be required if only scaling block size.

Always use a well trusted wallet. Mycelium and Coinomi are good options in the android space, Breadwallet for iOS.
@_date: 2017-11-12 08:20:17
It is an easy fix for scaling in the short term. The fact is that by only scaling with block size increases the network will never become the payment system that we all dream of. in order to match a payment system like visa, blocks would have to be massive. The network would become increasingly centralized with storage demands, and it would not be as efficient or instant as the LN network has shown. There are big ideas that can work with BTC such as 'onion' routed payments and more everyday. We need to do all we can in supporting the developers with long term vision.
'Satoshi' only presents how an increase to larger block size would work. Everyone needs to relax and hold on to their coins, at the end of the day BCH is not a viable payment network.

Huge block sizes is not good. Just so we're on the same page it is 340gb blocks. Andreas talks about it in the video. This means that 340gb would not only need to be stored every 10 minutes it would need to be verified which would require significant computational power and after some quick math: 17870.4 TeraBytes of data storage every year. Due to the fact that these systems are not run by 'people' the system becomes centralized. Furthermore, this still does not provide the type of scaleability multi-layer solutions would. Micro-transactions would still not be possible, and you'd still have 10 minute confirmations! Multi-layer is the solution that will make our coins worth very much.

@_date: 2017-11-15 05:31:56
Currently transaction fees occur if accepted by the market, and the transaction settles. My understanding is that a multi-layer solution would involve hundreds (growing in magnitude) of users facilitating 'hops', like the internet and this would show on chain as a few transactions. I am only assuming and if someone could offer input, I would apreciate it, that the tx fees would be distributed to the users fairly.
If layer solutions were centralized, say a company offers a service to utilize lightning network. I can imagine fees being imposed to use that service.

Well, buy BCH as well if you'd like to avoid ALL risk, but every fork that occurs you will have equal amounts of crypto in both legacy and forked bitcoin iterations. Meaning you don't have to babysit shit. Just allow your parents to have some baby fork children and wait. Maybe use your head and sell some bullshit forks when you can.

The thing you have quoted is factual regardless of whether they needed them. Ipv4 addresses were first live in 1983, supporting 4.3B devices. The point is scaling took time, the internet become did not just arrive in 1983 with this capability to scale. It took many years.

I'm not kidding. Satoshi mined thousands of blocks himself as I'm sure you know.. I don't feel like going through them either... but if we go ahead and look at block 9:
output address: 
we can see that he has 'spent coins'-- someone took the time to detail where: 
I do think he has used other coins and I'd like to see if anyone has found any additional proofs.

Some of it would be enjoyment. I recommend doing your research on gpu/scrypt mining. I think bitcoin mining has advanced so much that its difficult to compete but I wonder about ETH and other alts.
