Your best option in my opinion would be to have a website built for you that takes payments in your local currency and ask the designer to bear in mind the fact that you'd like to branch out into alternative currencies in the future.
That could be, dollars, pounds etc, but also other online payments too such as Paypal and then also Bitcoins.
That way, you'll be able to start taking payments from the general public straight away and can, if your online shop takes off, branch out into Bitcoins when you have a bit more of a steady income and have ironed out the kinks of running an online store.
I've done a number of stores and am currently adding Bitcoin payments to one, so feel free to drop me a PM and have a chat, but there's plenty of skilled web designers out there and on here that will be able to get you up and running with your online store.
So, TLDR; Look into getting your products online and selling in your countries local currency, get the hang of it and while that's being setup, dive into the wonderful world of Bitcoins and get yourself familiar with it's ins and outs before making your store Bitcoin only.

Hi, well I tested the file upload part of the Apply for Job section and even though it uploads the file before doing a check on it (tested a few 100mb and 1gb files) it is rejecting them on size. Maybe worth doing a file size check in browser before upload? May help prevent a malicious script kiddy constantly hammering your upload page with large files.
Your wp-admin directory is readable / lists contents, allowing me to browse around and although your config looks secure it gives access to the php files such as /wp-admin/install.php update.php upgrade.php etc even sticking an empty index.htm will hide that listing if you're feeling lazy :)
I'd consider an empty index.htm in the directory wp-content/uploads/ too just to hide the content from prying eyes because I can currently browse uploads/uploaded_cvs/
Only a minor note, but your emails sent after applying for a job are sent from 'wordpress which could be changed to a nicer more professional address?

Thank you :) I'm going to sleep now but will take another look in the morning and good luck, you have a new user here :)

Found a list of 5000 names and hashed passwords on Pastebin which appear to be from the same guy asking for 25 BTC for the list.

Thanks for that ESRogs, it allowed me to create one for Zetacoin (I know it's not Bitcoin but the code may be useful to someone...
    function getZetaCoinBalanceFromBlockExplorer(altCoinAddress)
    { 
        var response = UrlFetchApp.fetch(' + altCoinAddress).getContentText();
  
        var regex = /Balance: (.*)\s\w+&lt;br/g;
        var match = regex.exec(response);
        var balance = match[1];
        return balance;  
    }
