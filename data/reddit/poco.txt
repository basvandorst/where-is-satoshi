That would work if you held the companies that succeeded.  The crypto analogy would be all the altcoins.  Only a few of them will survive.


Not sure how this is relevant or correct.  Making it cheaper to produce something doesn't make it unprofitable.  If that were the case no one would produce cheap things (like your radio example).  The fact that you can buy cheap radios supports the fact that there is profit in producing them.


In a sense, yes.  Most of the altcoins that exist will eventually fall out of favour and only a few will survive and those supporting the dead ones will migrate to the survivors.  Now is about picking the future winners, and the gamble is which ones will have the tech and marketing to win.


Not sure where you are getting that or how it fits your analogy.  Are radios useless unless they are government tools?

No, the parent post is how fractional reserve banking works at a general level.
They don't lend out $10,000 for every $1000 deposited.  They lend out more like $800-$900 depending on the rules.
Their multiplier comes from when someone deposits that $900 and they lend out $890 to someone who deposits back into the bank and then they can lend out $810 of that, etc.
They can't just lend out 10x the amount deposited.

Selling enough to hit 0 isn't really a very good investment plan.  A better plan is to continue to invest as much as you feel comfortable investing.  If you strongly believe it is going to go up then you should be buying more.  If you strongly believe it is going to go down then you should be selling.  If you want to hedge one way or the other then you should sell or buy enough to make you comfortable.  At no point should that calculation include how much you initially invested.

It doesn't make it unethical.  They own and control the Bitcoin just as your bank controls the money in your account.  If some random company or group airdropped a new currency and said that they would give everyone a one to one match to US dollars by serial number, no one would expect their bank to give them this new currency.  In fact, if it was expected to have any value at all it might cause a run on the banks so people could get cash with serial numbers.  This is what people who wanted their bcash should have done.  They should have withdrawn their Bitcoin to get the serial numbers (so to speak).
The only reason people are upset is because it turns out to have actually been worth something.  If they cared enough before the fork they could have had their cash in hand.
@_date: 2017-12-27 19:28:13
Lower fees, but yes fees.  Moving cash is much more expensive than moving Bitcoin.  Think armored vehicle + guards.  Anything that isn't explicitly cash is like an off chain transaction.
Also, this is incredibly early in the technology.  Moving money 200 years ago was even more expensive than it is now.  Stagecoaches moving gold around was fraught with problems.

A credit card backed by Bitcoin is a great idea and probably going to happen someday.
Credit cards are a good example of off chain technology.  Private parties using an independent network to do transactions and then reconciling them on the primary network in the future.

There are two issues here, one is NiceHash and the other is Bitcoin exchanges in general.
NiceHash is a business where people were leasing their commuter power and getting paid for it at the end of the week.  The company has gone down before that week was up.  Just like if Google goes under tomorrow you are probably not receiving any Adsense money from the last month of advertising.
Bitcoin in general is like cash, not like a bank, and storing Bitcoin is a bit like keeping cash under your mattress.  If someone breaks into your house and steals your cash you have most likely lost it forever.  Yes, some would argue that storing money in a bank is safer than your mattress, and you are welcome to keep in there.
There is also nothing stopping someone from opening up a Bitcoin bank that insures deposits and acts in every way like a regular bank.  They could even give you a means to pay for things using Bitcoin from your account using a plastic card that keeps track of your balance and transfers Bitcoin to the recipient when you buy things.  They might even charge businesses a small fee to accept these types of cards, which will record the transactions off chain and give them Bitcoin later without the overhead if waiting for confirmations now.
TL;dr, Bitcoin is more like cash than a bank and a Bitcoin bank would be like a bank and could be insured if someone were so inclined.

That is all very technical and not interesting to most people.  The details of how the protocol works and what miners do is only useful if you are trying to figure out why it is secure and how anyone can prove that they have a Bitcoin.
I have had similar conversations with people and I find it best to start with how you use it and what it improves.
Quick transactions and low fees means that I can send money to anyone in the world quickly and for less than a bank money transfer.
No credit required, you can buy things online without a credit card or a bank.  You still need to get the bitcoins, but once you have them you can do whatever you want with them.  This also means no one controlling where you spend your money; gambling, drugs, etc.  (Yes, this is good thing to those of us who don't need a nanny telling us how to spend our money.  I don't gamble online or buy drugs, but if I did I would use Bitcoin).
I get into some implementation details about how it works, but only so far as the fact that the ledger of all transactions is shared by everyone and no one person controls it so there is no central bank.  No one can remove transactions and only you can transfer your coins.  The key for most people is realizing that a lot of very smart people have investigated the code and protocol to determine that it is secure.  There is some level of trust required to use it, as is the case of all open source projects where you haven't read all the source, but knowing that there are smart people constantly trying to break it is good enough for most of us.
In reality, for most people, Bitcoin doesn't give them anything over what they have now and there is little reason to consider using them unless they have a need to transfer large sums of cash to another country or hide their activity from authorities.  I don't know any adults without credit cards and bank accounts, so their benefits are limited.

Except that Gox shouldn't be leveraged on their bitcoin, so if they claim there is $X in coin or cash then there should be $X in coin or cash.  Everyone taking their money out should not impact anyone else.
Bank runs are a problem because banks loan out the money to other people, so when everyone tries to take their money out, they cannot because it isn't all in the bank.
In fact, if you could get your bitcoin out of Gox, but not your cash (as has been the case for a while) then that will increase the value of bitcoin as everyone is trying to buy.  You could argue that it will reduce the value of dollars, but it isn't big enough to have that sort of impact.

Bitcoin is only a competitor to PayPal if PayPal doesn't take them.  Once PayPal allows you to hold bitcoins in your PayPal wallet and spend/transfer them like any other currency they are no longer competing.
You have Bitcoins in your PayPal wallet and want to buy something on eBay for US$?  No problem, PayPal will convert those Bitcoins for you at a "nominal" fee and pay the seller.
You have US$ and want to buy something from someone accepting Bitcoins?  No problem, PayPal will convert those dollars for you at a "nominal" fee and pay the seller.
In fact, if they make it so that retailers receiving Bitcoins pay lower fees, like 0.5% or less (it is currently 2.9% to take dollars) then they can basically do Bitcoin to Bitcoin transfers cheap and make their money doing dollar conversions.
This basically starts moving the cost of payments to the buyers (not sure if PayPal want that...) as you now have to choose to have Bitcoins and pay nothing, or use your credit card to pay someone Bitcoins and PayPal will add the credit card fees to the conversion cost.  Then they might have to add different conversion fees (it costs more to pay with your credit card than have the money taken from your bank account)...  This would end up with people being much less dependent on their credit cards as they would now be actively trying to avoid it to keep the lowest fees.
It **could** be a very interesting time if PayPal adopted Bitcoins.

My point is that in almost all cases, PayPal is better off accepting Bitcoins than not accepting them.
And there will always be a need to convert between dollars and Bitcoins unless you are suggesting that Bitcoin will take over ALL world currencies and no one will ever convert between currencies again.

I do imagine it happening one day though.  It might be way off, who knows, but a full circle of "You send me bitcoins for a service I do, then I pay those bitcoins to someone else for a good they are selling, who then pays them back to you for your services" could happen.

Funny thing about the speculators, if they are right then you all win.  It isn't you vs them, it is people who buy now vs people who buy later or earlier.
Mining is hardly worth the cost, you might as well invest that money in Bitcoin directly.  It doesn't have to be much and it doesn't matter how much other people have.  If you think it will double in value and you get $1s worth, then you will have $2 later.  Sure, it is speculation, but you can also try to spend it on something.  If you buy even one Bitcoin that could be more than most people ever own if it becomes as popular as people hope.  That would make you the one percent.

Costco  does set the price that they charge for milk, which can be anything they want.  They could charge $100 for a gallon if they wanted to.  They don't want to because that would be a stupid price to pay and they wouldn't sell any milk.
This exchange can set the price of bitcoin for members to whatever it wants, but members aren't going to pay more than it costs on the open market and they aren't going to sell for anything less than the open market.  In effect, it is irrelevant whether their market or open or closed unless they actually own all the bitcoin, and exchanges don't usually own much, their members do.  Just like Costco won't just decide to set their milk prices much outside the normal market price.
@_date: 2014-05-14 20:02:35
That long run is a long way off, but in either world PayPal is better off by accepting and using Bitcoin.
If Bitcoin takes off and replaces credit cards for online transactions, then PayPal must involve itself in that transaction to stay in business.  There is ALWAYS going to be the need to convert dollars to Bitcoins and back and PayPal can position themselves to be there.
If Bitcoin doesn't take off and remains a niche market, then PayPal can make a few more dollars from that market by being the middle man between those who want to use Bitcoins and those who don't.
At the moment PayPal adds the most value to small retailers, allowing them to take credit cards and to consumers who do not have credit cards and connect it to their bank account.  They also offer fraud protection and charge-back.
If Bitcoin took over credit cards online (not likely, but let's imagine) then PayPal does lose that part of their business, since a retailer doesn't need PayPal to help with credit card processing.  PayPal doesn't want that, but they also don't want to be left behind if it happens.
There will always be the desire for fraud protection at some level.  Bitcoin is currently very one-sided and gives the seller all the power (the opposite of credit cards).  PayPal can offer escrow services with Bitcoin (at a fee, of course) that provide more consumer protection than raw Bitcoin.
The only good reason I can think of for PayPal to not jump on the Bitcoin bandwagon is if they think that by supporting it they will actually drive the push toward people using it, and thereby eliminating one of their business models.  Perhaps if they ignore Bitcoin everyone else will stop using it because no one as big as PayPal got involved.

You can have third party services that act like credit cards or PayPal between you and the merchant without regulations.  You just need trust and a way to prove that trust.  Deposit  insurance can be provided by anyone, not just the government.
PayPal could take bitcoin as a form of payment, like they take many foreign currencies.  That isn't strictly a benefit of bitcoin, but it isn't a friction either.

A run on an exchange is more like a run on a vault, not a run on a bank.  It would be like if you were storing your gold in a huge vault with other people and you all spontaneously decided that the vault was unsafe and you wanted to move your gold.
You aren't going to destroy your gold, you are going to take your gold and put it somewhere else.
MtGox has already effectively blocked cash withdrawals to the US for months, so this isn't an issue of everyone trying to get their cash out of Gox.  Up until now your only choice was to convert your cash to bitcoin and withdraw the bitcoin.  That raises the value of bitcoin.  If all the bitcoin could be removed from MtGox then it would end up in private wallets or other exchanges.  Yes, some people might try to sell it, but not if they had any understanding of its value before they moved.  The fact that they own it suggests that they see it has value, and more value in the future.
Even if you ignore the logical aspect, the fact that they had to pay a premium to get the bitcoin out of MtGox means that they will be less likely to dump it at the current market rates at other exchanges (which have been 20% lower for a while).
Now, it is certainly possible that, because of the risk of keeping your gold in a vault, and the need to move it somewhere else, you might just decide that you don't want to own gold anymore and try to sell it.  But that doesn't get worse if the vault lets your withdraw your gold.  In fact, it gets worse when the vault locks up and tells you that you cannot remove your gold for a few days.  That would make people even more anxious about holding gold in any vault and more likely to sell.

You can probably buy a used $20 phone, connect to a free WiFi, install a free bitcoin app, and have a usable wallet.
Yes, there are certain levels of poverty where this is not practical, and for them there are food stamps or cash.
There are also people in poverty who spend more than $20 per year to send/receive money from relatives through Western Union or the like.  There are those in poverty that spend more than $20 on pre-paid credit card fees because they can't get a normal credit card.
It is those on the fringe between absolute poverty and buying things that could use bitcoin more than those of us with enough money to get nice credit cards.  Bitcoin is much more useful for the poor than it is for the rich.
I don't need Bitcoin because I have a good credit rating and no trouble getting whatever credit card I need.  I can spend my money just fine everywhere I want to.  I can afford the time to research the cheapest way for me to move money around electronically so don't need bitcoin to send money overseas.
Bitcoin is the system with the potential** to allow people to use it without any higher level understanding of money than just "cash".  If you understand cash then you understand how to use bitcoin.  Sending bitcoin to someone is easier than sending cash through Western Union.   It is easier than putting a check in the mail and waiting for it to arrive. Giving someone bitcoin in person is almost as easy as giving them cash.
** I use the word potential because it still isn't quite there yet.  At this point you still need to convert it to cash if you want to spend it in most places.  The potential is that one day I can send you Bitcoins, you receive them in your wallet, go to the grocery store, and spend them at the checkout.  No internet, no computers, just a smartphone or probably something even better***
*** Just thought of a great idea that is probably already underway.  A Bitcoin wallet device with nothing but a small screen and camera that uses mobile data to provide universal access to the blockchain.  There is no monthly charge for service, but it collects a small fee from each transaction done through it to pay for the service.  Much like how you can buy books from your Kindle over mobile data without paying for the service directly.

False.  You can't loan out any more money than you have either.  Fractional reserve just means that you have to keep a fraction of the deposits in reserve at the bank.  They can only lend out 90% (differs by country) of the money that they have.  Without fractional reserve rules they might try to lends out 100% of the deposits, but that becomes a problem when someone wants to withdraw their money.

Not crazy, that's how money works.  You lend it out and hope that it is repaid and do it for a specific fee (though 5% per year would result in interest of $2762, not $500).


That's now how money works.  Banks can't lend out 10x the balance on the books, they can lend out 90% of the balance on the books.  Fractional reserve banking means that they have to reserve a **fraction** of their balance.  In the US the law is that they have to reserve 10%.
The reason that you've been told that banks multiply the amount of money in circulation is because when they lend out the money, the person they lend it to usually gives it to someone else, who deposits it into a bank, which the bank can then lend out 90% again and so on.
An example:
Fred deposits $12,000 into the bank.  Bob borrows $10,000 from the bank and uses it to buy a used car.  The used car dealership takes the money and deposits it into their bank account for later.  The car dealership's bank can now lend out $9,000 of that money to Sue, who borrows it to buy a car.  The dealership deposits that money into their account and the bank, again, lends out $8100 to Bill from that deposit.
The bank, that started with $12,000 has now loaned out $27,100 BUT the bank is also owed $27,100 (from Bob, Sue, and Bill), so the net balance is $12,000, which is exactly what Fred deposited.
This could happen with a bank using BTC instead of dollars.  You can only lend out what people have deposited, it just happens that people keep money in the bank, even the money that someone else borrowed.

How is that not true?  He bought something worth $10, it went up in value to $300k+, sold half for cash (got cash from his ticket) and put the other half in BTC.
You did the same thing.  You bought BTC cheap in 2013, sold some for cash, and still hold some as BTC.
Any decision that you do with the BTC you hold should be the same as if you bought it today or in 2013.  It is worth whatever it is worth RIGHT NOW and if your total investment goes down $10,000 tomorrow then you lost $10,000.  It doesn't matter where the BTC came from.
EDIT: More specifically, as you said, if you lose it all right now it won't affect you much.  Same with him (since he started with $10).

They can lend out money they have, but not all of it, hence they have to "reserve a fraction" of it.  They "create money" not by lending out more than they have, but by lending money to those who then deposit it back in a bank which can lend out some more.
You deposit $1000, the bank can lend out $800.  They lend it to someone who buys something and the money gets deposited into the account of the store that sold the thing.  They now have $1800 on the balance sheets and can lend out an additional $640.  Etc.
They can account for all the money.  If they recall all of their loans then they can pay back all of their deposits.

No one here is trying to paint social programs as irresponsible.  They are a great idea to help lift the people out of poverty...
The problem that people have is the idea that you can pay for them by stealing the businesses in the country and running them into the ground and squeezing them dry.
It turns out that capitalism has demonstrated itself as the BEST way to get people to do more things and grow the economy.  You could argue that the growth happens in the wrong places and disproportionately, but that can be "solved" with a better taxation and regulatory system.
If you let everyone run businesses freely and charge them 80% income tax you would get a healthier system than what you have now.  I'm not advocating for a 80% income tax, but it would be better than total and complete inflation and poverty.  At least people would keep working for the 20% they get to keep (and the 80% pays for the social programs).
The problem with the current system of centralizing control over all industries and businesses is that it eliminates all incentives to do anything useful.  If I can't even get 20% of my value out of the business then why bother running it well?  It turns out that those in charge did best by stealing what they could and letting it burn.  That is no way to run a country.
@_date: 2018-10-03 14:40:25
That's not how that works.  Fractional reserve means that they can lend out a fraction of their money but must reserve a fraction in their balance.  If they recalled all the loans then they would have the correct amount of money to pay back all the balances.
The suggestion is that Coinbase might not even have the right number on their balance sheet.  Since they don't have a business of lending out Bitcoin, there is no reason that they don't hold exactly the same number of Bitcoin as their customer's balances except for fraud.
@_date: 2019-03-28 10:06:12
Nothing is created, just moved around.  The net balance of the accounts in the bank is the same as the cash that was printed.  You deposit $1000, they lend out $900 to someone who deposits it in the bank, which then lends out $810 to be deposited back in the bank.  It looks like the bank created $1710, but that is just the positive balance.  If you also consider what the bank owes to the depositors, the net balance is $1000.  $2710 was deposited, and $1710 was loaned out.
@_date: 2018-10-03 19:17:46


They can do this because if everyone comes for their money then they will recall the loan and demand that $800 back and then pay back the $1000.  That doesn't tend to happen all at once very often, but it can happen, see "run on the bank".
Coinbase selling an extra Bitcoin wouldn't be fractional reserve, it would be fraud.
If they lend someone a Bitcoin, that must be paid back later, then I suppose you could argue the balance of the accounts might appear to be more than the Bitcoin they have in reserve.

I don't see how it matters what the currency or asset is.  If you can lend it out then you can lend out as much of what you own as you want (within legal limits).  Banks can hold your coin, lend it out, and then hold that too.
The biggest risk with that system is that it is much more practical for anyone to withdraw all their coin in minutes, and much harder for the bank to recall their loans as fast.  It seems like a run would be more likely, but maybe not.

That's not how this works.  That's not how any of this works.
Fractional reserve banking is where banks must reserve some of the money they have and can't lend out.  If they have 10 fiat and reserve 10% then they can only lend out 9.
The multiplier effect comes from the fact that the entity that borrowed the 9 will deposit that back in a bank probably, which means that the bank can lend out 8.1 if that 9.  Etc.
They can't lend out more than they think they have, they are legally required to lend out less.
The total amount of real money in the system is still 10 when you add up the balances and the debts.  It just looks like more because the positive balance is 17.1 when you ignore the debts.
The same could be done with Bitcoin since the total amount of real units is 10.  But you could shuffle numbers in a computer to allow you to borrow more.  The total sum of the positive balance could be more than 10, but the debt makes it a net of 10.
This only becomes a problem when everyone wants to withdraw their money all at once.  That first guy wants his 10 back, but the bank must collect the debt of 9 from the second guy who then tried to withdraw his 9 which caused the bank to have to collect their debt from the third guy, etc.
My point was that with Bitcoin it is much easier to simply ask for your money to be sent to an external wallet.  I suppose that isn't much easier than asking for a wire transfer to another bank, but it feels like it is more practical, particularly since that wallet might just be a paper wallet in your safe.
@_date: 2017-01-23 19:30:36
That's a good point.  That would be a way to solve the "refunds in Bitcoin".  However it would also be a very different solution than any other marketplace that anyone is used to.
If you buy a Chinese product from an American store in US$ and then return it, they do not adjust the amount returned by the value of the US$ relative to the Yuan.  You pay $1 you expect $1 in return, even if the product was being shipped directly from China to your home.
If you are buying a vacation package to Europe in Euros on your US$ credit card and the Euro doubles in value, your refund will always be in US$ for the amount you paid (assuming you could get a refund, but that is beside the point).
So while they *could* adjust the refund to the exchange rate, I wonder if the general public is willing to accept such an arrangement and how they would react to it.

That isn't a problem, it is a feature of Bitcoin.  The problem is people who think that a hard fork means they get two coins and try to spend them differently.  There is just one blockchain, and by definition it is the longest one.
Bitcoin is a trustless system where you don't have to trust any individual for the system to work.  It works by consensus and that consensus is that the longest chain is the right chain.  Anyone can change the code in any client or miner, and if that code produces a new block and other clients and miners respect that block and it is now part of the longest chain of blocks then it is Bitcoin.
SW2 is looking to become the real Bitcoin by having a longer chain.  If it can't it dies, if it does then you should be sure to have a client that can understand it since it is now Bitcoin. 
If you ignore it and continue on with your daily life you will eventually have the same number of Bitcoin as you do now.
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:29:55
Companies that accept Bitcoin usually use third party services to accept the Bitcoin and convert it to dollars for them.  They set their prices in dollars and the Bitcoin price adjusts automatically.  You walk in, agree to pay $10, pay about $10 worth of Bitcoin, walk out with tacos.  The money is then delivered to the store as dollars in their bank.  They never see the Bitcoin.

If the value of the Bitcoin is higher when you sell it than when you bought it then you pay capital gains tax.
Just because you use it to buy a car doesn't change the fact that you converted the Bitcoin into a $30,000 car.  For tax purposes, in either the US or Canada, that is considered a sale of the Bitcoin for $30,000.
It is no different than selling for dollars and buying things with those dollars.  If you could avoid tax by not using dollars then no one would ever pay capital gains tax.
@_date: 2017-11-28 18:26:03


Because that is what you have with you, you want to encourage the community, and you have a way to buy Bitcoin to reset how much you have.  OR you have a LOT of Bitcoin and the potential value of that $10 is less than your enjoyment of a taco now.
Put another way, why would anyone buy taco today when they could take that money and buy Bitcoin with it instead?


That is a bold statement.  There is absolutely no guarantee that Bitcoin will be worth more tomorrow than today.  There have been many days in the past when that was not true.  It is a very risky investment and diversifying into tacos might not be a bad idea if you are hungry and have too much Bitcoin.

You can almost certainly bet their unlock code on the phone in question is a 4-6 digit pin.  It isn't hard to brute force a 6 digit numerical pin (there are, oh, about somewhere near approximately exactly 1,000,000 of them).
The problem that they face is the device may permanently lock itself if you enter the wrong one a few times.  They need a new version of the OS that will allow them to try all million without getting locked out, and try them electronically.
@_date: 2016-02-17 23:50:14
It is possible to install a new OS that will allow you an unlimited number of password attempts, which they want so they can brute-force the password/PIN.  They can't just decrypt the data, but trying all possible PINs to unlock it would not take long.
I also believe that the latest phones have the rate limiting and locking in hardware so this wouldn't work on them.

They want a way to try them electronically so they can run through them all in a few minutes.

Dumping waste into a lake should be illegal in a Libertarian society as it causes harm to those around the lake or downstream from the lake or those that own the lake.
Personally I think that anything that could likely result in a successful civil suit (suing the company that dumped chemicals causing harm to me) should be handled by the government (much like murder causes harm to me).  That means agencies like the EPA should absolutely exist in a libertarian society.

The law should exist and prevent harm being inflicted from one person onto another.  You can't trust people not to murder other people, you can't trust people not to cheat others, but at the same time you can't trust people to control other people's lives either.

The world isn't black and white, it is many shades of gray.  Nothing is absolute and nothing changes overnight.  You can't try to change the world all at once.  Baby steps.
The state already intervenes in so many ways.  UBI is better than minimum wage as it has less market distorting effects.  UBI is better than welfare because it doesn't cut if when you get work.  Perhaps charity isn't enough to support those in need, and there is no way that society will allow them to be completely ignored.  I could say that everyone should be free to do what they want and fuck you to those born with medical or mental problems, but that isn't going to get us anywhere.
Personally, I'm doing quite well, so I don't need charity or minimum wage or welfare or UBI, so maybe get rid of them all if that makes you happy.  Me, I'm ok with society demanding a bit more.  Perhaps I'm not libertarian enough for you, whatever that means.

First, I'm still not sure now this makes an argument against changing society to be more libertarian.  These conditions exist now.  It sounds like you are more upset with the free market than all freedom in general.
There is nothing stopping you and others like you from donating money to people less fortunate than you.  We do it all the time.  The capital that we own gives us the freedom to help others.
Who knows what these people might do with their time if give the opportunity of doing anything?  The hurdles of starting your own business and the regulatory maze make it all but impossible for someone with no education and living paycheck to paycheck to even try.
There are people who are not able to contribute more than minimum wage to society (sometimes less) and it sucks for them to be stuck in a society that has advanced past them.  Their last of education or upbringing or whatever keeps them from contributing more.
They can be helped in a number of ways, but preventing then from getting jobs because you close down their employer isn't helpful.  Closing all the places that they might work because it doesn't pay enough is a great way to speed the automation of menial tasks.  That is great for society as a whole, but leaves them even further behind than they are now.
What you are looking for is better income distribution.  It is true that a pure libertarian society night dismiss things like minimum wage and tax distribution, but nothing is ever pure.  Taxation is theft in the eyes of the person being taxed involuntarily.  But some of us accept it as a reasonable theft.  I don't like the idea of stealing from others to pay for my ideas, but nothing is ever perfect.
Personally I would like to consider something like a UBI to help with the distribution of wealth as more and more people drop off from being able to contribute more to society.  The more we automate the more the capital accumulates and UBI is one way to redistribute that wealth.  This is more of an economical perspective and less a pure libertarian one.
But claiming that poor existing conditions are a reason why we shouldn't consider changing society to something different seems counter productive.

It is about the rate of use.  If you buy some Bitcoin, use it to buy something, and they turn it into cash, then the market hasn't changed much and there is no change in value.
However, if 1,000,000 people all try to do that at the same time, the price will be pushed up as there are a lot of people buying and those selling will just ask for more.
If you expect to use it quickly then it doesn't matter what costs, so there very little downward pressure on the price if everyone wants it.  That is, if you are sending $100 worth to someone then it doesn't matter whether that was 1 Bitcoin or 0.0001 Bitcoin.  The only thing that matters is that the value doesn't go down before they get it.


If it gets converted back to dollars then that will reverse the price push.  This is why the prices fluctuates and doesn't keep going up.  In fact, as more stores started accepting it, it had a negative effect on the price.  People who already owned Bitcoin were able to buy things, but the stores don't want to hold Bitcoin so they would sell it immediately.  So then are more sellers than buyers.


That is very much not true.  That is why the government sometimes prints more money.  Inflation is a real thing.  The value of things isn't based on what the value of the dollar is, it is based of the value of other the things I can buy with that dollar.  If I work for an hour and earn $10 for that hour of work and I can buy some socks for that $10, then what I'm doing is saying that I am willing to work for an hour for those socks.  It doesn't matter whether they are $10 or $10,000,000 for an hour of work and a pair of socks, the purchase decision is the same.  Again, the value is directly based on how many dollars are in circulation because I want some and you want some and we need to be able to go to the store and buy stuff and get paid, etc.

While I refuse to pay bank fees and will switch to whichever bank gives me the best mortgage rate and no fees, I think you might be exaggerating your understanding of the money multiplying effects of banks.
They don't lend out 10x what you hold with them.  In fact, they can only lend out less than what you have with them (80-90%).
The money multiplier comes from the idea that the money they lend out gets put back in the bank by someone else, where they can then lend out some of it.  However, that other person has a bank account and they lending out part of his balance, not yours.
Their profit per deposit account can still be measured from the amount times the interest rate at which they lend divided by the risk of default.

It is possible with any currency, Bitcoin included.
The digital representation of the "money" doesn't have to be in Bitcoins.  It can be entirely internal to the bank and they only use Bitcoins for transactions in or out.  If a bunch of banks get together and agree to use Bitcoins between them, they could setup their own account records and they only need to send/receive actual Bitcoins when the money enters or leaves their system.
Basically, they can use Bitcoins in the same way that they currently use dollars - they don't move physical dollars around when you transfer money between accounts, and they don't need to transfer Bitcoins around either.
The problem is getting enough people to accept the digital "bitcoin balance" in a large enough system that they can do fractional reserve banking.
Now, if you expect to have a Bitcoin wallet at your bank - well, that is like a safe deposit box where you would pay a rent for that - just like you would if you wanted to bank to hold your cash for you.  Otherwise, you withdraw small amounts of BTC to your digital wallet (just like cash to your real wallet) and spend it.

At best they can follow the money as it leaves an exchange with your personal information, but my understanding is that they can't or won't do this for all accounts, just large transactions.
They can specifically ask for your data, but they would need to know to ask.

It is a bit of a trust issue too.  Bitcoins are still on the fringe of society and many sites that deal with Bitcoins are still a bit sketchy.  Yes, this is needed to take them into legitimacy, but in the mean time you have to give your personal information to someone you may or may not trust.
Bitcoins are a high risk investment for most people with the very real chance that it will fall apart, possibly due to the currency dropping in value, but also because the web sites holding your trading money or online wallet (ya, I know, don't use one) could vanish tomorrow.
I'm not saying this is valid, just how people view it.  Like if you had to verify your identity with your marijuana dealer because they were trying to comply with some regulations now that it is legalized in their state.
It is a catch-22.  They can't become legitimate without the personal information but some people feel uncomfortable giving out that information until they are legitimate.

I'm pretty sure it can go either way and there is some debate over using units of measure like miles and hours because they are not discrete items like cars and clocks.
I was just picking on your example because you claimed that they aren't countable and used an example of "a mile" which is a single item and exactly where less should be used.
Maybe a better example is "less than a car, fewer than 2 cars".  Of course "less than a car"makes no sense :)

Turning those bitcoins into cash on the other side makes it like carrying cash the whole way.
If you start with cash (and buy bitcoins) and then sell the bitcoins later (for cash) then those bitcoins could certainly be interpreted as monetary instruments, just like gold.
While it is true that the law may not reflect this, and that is great, but is it because that wasn't the intention or because bitcoins didn't exist when the laws were written?
Technically you aren't carrying them with you at all, but that is just an interpretation issue.  Similar to sending cash by mail.
If you sent cash across the border by mail you would be (stupid) expected to declare it.  You didn't carry it with you, but that isn't really the point.
I'm still curious how the government would react to this, but not curious enough to ask directly as this would cause more trouble that it is worth.
@_date: 2013-10-16 05:45:03
Well, I assume we are talking about money that will be spent in the US while there.


If the intention is to spend more than $10,000 while there, then I would think that falls under carrying monetary instruments.
I have thought about this a bit because I do transfer money across the border, and doing it via bitcoin would be cheaper than most bank transfer fees.

That is what we do on Reddit, speculate.  Bitcoin is all about speculation.
I think it is less speculative to imagine that Bitcoin would fall under normal money regulations than it is to invest in Bitcoin in the first place.
I'm not filing anything, nor do I have any immediate plans to, but I am posing the question for discussion here.  It isn't even about picking a set of laws at random, it is about trying to follow the spirit of the law, which is the best we can do, other than, perhaps, ignore it entirely.
The spirit of money laundering laws clearly would want bitcoin transactions to follow the same rule as any monetary transaction.  I don't think there is even a question there.  Exchanges have already been shutdown for less.
The last thing we want is for ~~regulators~~ legislators to write laws specific to Bitcoin.  That cannot go well.

I'm trying to see it how could be viewed by the law and "authorities".  The only thing that matters is how judges and lawyers feel about it, and how that could translate into precedent.
However, it is not much different than what has been done before.  The implementation is different, but how it is used is similar to a foreign currency.  Bitcoin trading is A LOT like forex trading.
Also, it isn't coming from another person, it is information in the blockchain (much like your bank balance isn't really money, it is just information in a bank computer).  If it was coming from another person, then there are just as many rules to apply regarding gifts and how much you can give to another person in a year.  That is actually WORSE than thinking of them as just another form of money because then trading bitcoins becomes gifts or commercial transactions.
If you try to frame bitcoins in a way that is familiar to people, it is most like a bank balance (which is already mostly virtual) of a foreign currency.  Again, I'm talking about how we use it, not how it is implemented.
* You can exchange it for your local currency (or another currency)
* You can exchange it for goods (there are many countries where retailers accept another country's currency as cash)
* You can horde it.
* The value fluctuates due to global demand.
This is also, in my opinion, the best legal interpretation for people that use it, because there are no rules about limits of transactions, other than reporting requirements, as long as it is still yours.  When you exchange it for goods or services then it would *be best* if it fell into the same rules as money.
I would even go so far as to suggest that people should report it like cash for the simple reason that **we don't want anyone going to court over it because some lawyer decides that they aren't following the law**.  A US court could decide that trading in bitcoins is NOT like money and instead falls into some other area with more reporting requirements and taxes.  It is much better for everyone involved to try and stay within the existing laws and not push the envelope so that it never gets to it.
It is also possible that the court could decide that bitcoins should be entirely unregulated, which would be great, but the chances of it happening are small.  We can't all have the same luck as the California porn industry.

To be fair, PayPal isn't doing that many transactions with the credit card companies or banks.  Many happen internally (PayPal to PayPal) and I suspect those that happen to other providers like visa are accumulated and done as larger blocks of transactions at the end of the day or week.  What would be interesting to see is how many individual transactions they do in or out of PayPal.

Yes, legislators write laws, but if they write one that has the word Bitcoin in it it will be the downfall of Bitcoin.  Nothing good can come from that.  Nothing.
If users of Bitcoin treat them like money and follow money rules then there will be no pressure for them to legislate anything.  The less legislation the better.

Bitcoin is more like cash than a bank account.
When you transfer money from a Canadian bank to a US bank they can monitor that and the banks file the appropriate paperwork with the required government agencies to track the transaction...
When you buy bitcoins in Canada and sell bitcoins in the US they don't have any way to track that.  Just like bringing cash or gold across the border.
The rules were written when they thought that the only way to get things of value across the border was to carry them with your (or have them shipped or mailed).  They didn't imagine that it could be virtual items.  The spirit of the law would clearly include declaring bitcoins.
@_date: 2013-10-16 15:20:34
All interesting perspectives, but it still doesn't answer how the law feels about it.
If you want to get technical then it doesn't matter how you got them, just like it doesn't matter how you got the cash (assuming legal methods in both cases).  If you mined them or were given them or traded them you still own them.
While you are not traveling with them the law does account for that by considering monetary instruments that were shipped or mailed.
Worse yet, if it doesn't count as transporting money, does it count as income?  Are you allowed to trade coins for money or do you need permission for that?

This is currently up to the consumer and business to decide.  Each business can set their own return policy.  Most currently take dollars and use Bitcoin only as a payment system, so I expect they would return the same dollars at the current exchange rate.  Not ideal, since it would be up to them so decide what that rate is, but it will become clear who is honest and who is not.
Best if they use the same rate for sales and returns, with no spread, as that just looks like a scam.  If they are charging $500 now and accept 1 BTC as payment and a month later the item is returned but that same item costs 1.2 BTC then I expect they would return 1.2 BTC.  Anything else will screw the customer and they won't have many customers for long.

Even if they aren't interested in selling and have nothing but the best intentions, they don't care as much about your money as you do and are much more likely to gamble with it.
I don't have any bitcoins yet but if I told you to hold it might be because I *want* them to go up and I *want* you to make more money, but I don't have to consider the risk and it is no skin of my back if you lose everything.

The thing is that most merchants that take Bitcoin just want dollars and are using a service to convert them.  It would suck for them if they had to refund the full amount of BTC even if the price of BTC had gone up.  They get $500 and then someone returns an item and they have to refund $800?  That would be the end of Bitcoin merchants.
@_date: 2013-10-16 23:22:28
Well, that is up to interpretation.  If someone decided tomorrow that bitcoins were considered monetary instruments then all prior transactions would be up for review and could trigger penalties if not filed correctly.
It is worth considering where it will land.
It isn't likely to be new laws that come about to handle them, they will be fit into existing laws and courts will decide how they are to be interpreted, which means the rules will apply retroactively since there no new rules will be defined (it will just clarify how the old rules were meant to be implemented).
Ultimately it would be best for bitcoins to fall under monetary instruments like wire transfers.  You can imagine Bitcoin exchanges a bit like an international transfer coming from the country of "Bitcoin".  The bank accepts the transfer and converts it into your local currency.
Anything else is worse (capital gain, income, a trust?) and would lead to much bigger headaches.  At least with cash and money, they only thing the government wants is to track them and catch you laundering money (which is stupid).  With anything else there is tax or paperwork involved, and no one wants that.
Now, of course, you can just stay under the table, that is one of the advantages of Bitcoin.  However, going legit means respecting the existing rules, no matter how much you don't like them.
At some point someone is going to have to figure out how these rules should be respected, and I worry that it will be defined when someone is prosecuted for not declaring their Bitcoin transactions.

That is similar to everywhere.  Also, the free you are paying when you leave thousands in the account is the lost opportunity to earn money with those funds.  The bank gets their fee by lending that money out while it is in your account.
So in effect everyone it's paying a bank fee.
That said I always bank with banks that charge nothing directly and it is too bad that you don't have those options in Ireland.

But when you have the swiss bank account transfer $10,000 to an American (or Canadian) bank, those banks declare it with their respective governments.
Digitally sending bits that represent value is already declared (think international wire transfer), it is just done by the institutions that we use to do the transfers.  Namely banks.  Bitcoins are just another way to represent perceived virtual value.
I suspect that Bitcoin exchanges are required to declare cash transfers of large amounts to meet regulatory requirements to help catch "money launderers", so perhaps all of the requirements are already being met for most people.  If that is sufficient then maybe there is no issue.
However, if you do in-person cash exchanges then legally you are either transferring monetary instruments OR you are selling product, both of which have their own set of rules and requirements.
I would prefer that Bitcoins be treated like money, because the idea of having to declare them as products being sold in another country scares me.  Then it would be no different than taking $10,000 worth of toothbrushes across the border to sell (commercial license?) or, worse yet, if you want to take the "but I didn't carry anything with me" to the extreme, then it is just straight up income.  You had nothing when you cross the border, then you had cash, the only other explanation is that it was earned or given to you, both come with their own set of rules (some of which are illegal).
@_date: 2013-12-31 20:20:24
They don't.  They price their item in dollars and receive dollars when you buy, but they use a third party like bitpay to accept the Bitcoin and turn them into cash (like the way PayPal takes your credit card number and gives dollars to the merchant, in a strictly metaphorical sense).  So the merchant doesn't have to do anything fancy to support Bitcoin.  Hell, I suppose they could just refund in dollars if that is their primary currency, and it is up to you to turn them back into Bitcoin.
@_date: 2013-10-16 17:40:35
You don't declare your portfolio at customs, but if you go across the border and get a wire transfer from your Canadian bank into a US bank it will be reported to the correct "authorities" by the banks.
Everything is done electronically anyway, not just Bitcoins, so it really shouldn't be that different.  It isn't like a wire transfer is physically transporting cash, and yet it is reported.
In fact, if you cash out more than $10,000 worth of bitcoins I suspect that your exchange has to report it (and those that don't go out of business) so it may already be handled that way.
This is what I'm trying to figure out.  Is it the responsibility of the exchange to report the transaction or is it your responsibility?  If you do an street exchange should it be reported like cash?

That is essentially what PayPal already is (if you consider the cash in your PayPal account).  You make a purchase through PayPal with Bitcoin and it will receive the bitcoin and send the cash in whatever currency the receiver wants it.
If there is a problem then they can return the Bitcoins and retrieve the money from the seller (like they do now).
If the seller wants to receive Bitcoins then PayPal will hold them for some pre-determined amount of time in the sellers PayPal account and make them available after the buyer clears things.
Basically the same as PayPal with cash, but PayPal has to hold on to the Bitcoins because they can't just pull money from the user's bank account when they want it back.

One advantage might be cost.  If you can get the money in and out of bitcoins for less than PayPal then there is an advantage...
Bitpay charges 0.99%.  PayPal charges 2.9% + $0.30.  That is almost 2% more than bitpay.
Many exchanges charge 0.5% to convert your money to BTC.
If a retailer gives you a 2% discount for using BTC instead of PayPal or Credit Cards then it might be worth doing.

This is what happens when you deal with exchanges that are too far away for you to reach legally and **without any sort of deposit insurance**.
Just like if you put money into a Swiss bank account and that bank went under and you lost your money.  Sure, the Swiss have regulations, but a bank can follow them and still fail.
Things like this used to happen to banks too.
The only reason that most banks don't fail more often is because
* They make a lot of money by being successful and not failing
* There is deposit insurance that keep people from removing all of their deposits at the slightest sign of trouble
* Momentum - people don't switch banks just because their web site crashed or they had a bad quarter.
Bitcoin exchanges don't have the deposit insurance, so they need to rely on reputation, but that is no different than an eBay selling having a reputation and trusting that he will send you the product you ordered.
You have to put some level of trust in the partner you are dealing with.
And when all that fails, you need to be able to find them and sue them for your losses.  That means public information about who runs the exchanges, who owns them, and in what jurisdiction.  Don't deal with an exchange that your lawyer can't find.

It only really works when it benefits the user.  That is, if you see a benefit from identifying voip packets vs torrent packets and how you want them to behave over your narrow connection to your isp.  There may be a situation where you get a better audio stream by identifying the torrent packets as low priority so they don't flood your own connection.  However, outside the house or office, people will do what they can to get the best value for their dollar.  If they could download movies faster by making their torrent packets higher priority then they will do that, social contract or not.
Also, the idea of having fast and small vs slow and big isn't a bad one, but it becomes a scalability problem because now the nodes in the middle need to keep track of all the traffic going through them to make sure to throttle you if you have too many fast packets.  They need no keep a history, which takes more RAM and power, all to prevent people from cheating a system that is just begging for cheaters.
If you treat all packets the same then things get a lot simpler.

Another advantage over other digital systems is the fees.  Receiving bitcoins is a lot less expensive than credit cards.  Using bitcoins instead is instant secure and cheap.
Those cc fees, however, are used to pay for the equipment and chargebacks and overhead of having someone to talk to when things go wrong.  I don't see online retailers moving away from some form of central processors, even if they are using bitcoin internally (like a bitcoin credit card) and those would still come with the fees.  I would be nervous about using bitcoins to pay for something online in case it gets lost or damaged.
I think that it could take off as an alternative to cash when used in person, not online.  I want to buy something from you that costs hundreds or thousands (bike, car, surfboard, whatever) without carrying the cash.  No chargeback is needed because I am taking the item home with me.
@_date: 2013-12-04 15:41:47
One thing to consider is that, if it were to replace PayPal and credit cards, there would likely be a similar credit/escrow service to replace them, even in Bitcoin.  The number of transactions that visa does in a day are mostly handled on their network and get combined before money is enchanted between merchants and customers.
