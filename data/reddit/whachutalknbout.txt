Crypto related businesses should be sending coins off to a secure cold storage not physically available on site. Being robbed would mean losing a tiny fraction from your hot wallet. 
Otherwise they better have a hell of a security system and guards.

I have some. But only because they were free, from the fork. Sold most yesterday though. BCash is worse than a lot of the altcoins out there, in literally every way.  It's complete garbage that a kid could have coded up. You keep buying it though, best of luck. 
Also, I've been around since 2012.  But thanks for your witty retort. I go and it's full of geniuses like yourself. Which makes me sad, and scared, for all of you. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:10:53
You interpret things in strange and incorrect ways. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 20:15:59
Your posts make me dumber the more I read. It's as if you're an angry five year old with no understanding of the world. I hope the best for you - seek help. And fast.

Ok. So what else has this much percent gain per month/year? Should I instead invest in stocks or something then? Last year, which stock had this much return on my money? 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:13:52
Fair enough. And you are right. It's insanely high risk and volatile. As they say, only invest what you can afford to lose. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 21:31:25
You've lost it. BCash is literally clone of bitcoin with a few lines of changes my dead grandma could've coded (and, they fucked that up too). It's garbage dude. They stole it, and added sweet dick all, they made nothing. It's going nowhere. You're an idiot who fell for a scam, I get it.  And, for the record, there are no devs, no roadmap, nothing - I've been asking forever about this. It's all just a bunch of fake junk. Sticking to what someone guessed may be a solution 9 years ago is utterly stupid. Could you imagine Google, Netflix, McDonalds, shit any company not changing to adapt. I'm not suggesting bitcoin is the ultimate solution either. Right now, they are both in trouble, and they are only hurting each other. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 01:04:05
Not at all. I'm saying that today alone you could have made more in bitcoin gains than in most (any?) stock over the last year. This guy says it's too late, why bother investing. I say who the hell knows. Tomorrow could yield more than whatever else you stick your money for a whole year. It's too random to predict, and saying it's pointless now and too late makes no sense. Whether it's 100 or 100k. It's all about percentage gain, not about   your capital for investing. 
@_date: 2018-05-13 10:03:00
Sounds completely legit. 
@_date: 2018-08-02 08:51:58


If this actually happens, then we're all fucked on so many levels.

How do the would-be-thieves know how much he has left? Could be as poor as me. Further, how do they know he doesn't have it locked up in a bank only he can access? I mean I guess thieves are dumb, but what's the plan here - drag the guy into his bank and force him to retrieve his key? What if he gives them a fake backup key with only a tiny percentage of his total? Oh man, what if the key is spread across many banks? I mean, if I had money, that's what I'd do. I'd also have a pretty strong failsafe plan, just in case someone is totally stupid enough to try something so idiotic. These hypothetical and highly dumb thieves are taking one helluva chance, hope they like jail and stuff cause that's where they are headed, clearly. Don't think they thought it through. If you ask me they'd be smarter to just steal the car.

The dollar is subjective? What are you on? 
@_date: 2018-06-30 10:32:07
This makes no sense, sounds silly and uneducated. You can buy any amount you want. You can buy a millions dollars worth, or a dollars worth, or whatever your little heart desires. You don't need to buy a  full bitcoin. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 20:19:36
That's a brutal conclusion. The demand just isn't strong enough, yet. Plus, it's not as if people aren't working on this right now. Give it time. It's coming. Sorry but everything can't be available everywhere by everyone yesterday just  for you. What a world that would be. 
@_date: 2017-11-05 19:42:48
Quadrigacx. Hands down. Also check out @_date: 2019-04-17 20:30:47
It's sad that we have to now use ticker abbreviations of all things to distinguish between coins, all because of a few bad actors. Great for adoption indeed.
@_date: 2017-04-13 21:01:13
...Right, I said "help tremendously", which is true, no?    
@_date: 2017-04-23 23:37:19
What's the maximum withdrawal limit? 
@_date: 2017-04-10 13:54:55
I read your comment as: "Hey we can probably still make a few focused changes here and there so we obviously don't need to fundamentally improve the protocol in order to promote future growth and development".  
That's simply a bad way to think.  I can't imagine where the world would be today with that kind of mentality: "Maybe something heavier than air just can't fly.  Let's instead stick with minor improvements to land and water travel.".
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:52:29
Ah. I was mislead then I guess. Does it not help tremendously with lightning? Which in of itself is a huge scaling benefit? Plus I thought it would increase the amount per block, or something like that. And fix the mallability issue to boot, including the nasty ASICBOOST.   
@_date: 2017-04-13 20:03:08
Why not SegWit right now? 
@_date: 2018-02-23 23:53:48
True, but at least one can easily acquire mutual funds and stocks still. In Canada, we're running low on options to buy bitcoin. 
@_date: 2018-02-24 15:42:17
I don't disagree. But bank transfers these days are getting awfully difficult here as well. And there aren't many interac options. It's a dance, and not a fun one. Difficult on ramps impede adoption. 
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:43:01
Hahaha. Good one. 
@_date: 2018-02-26 02:39:56
Ask this in Generally people use QuadrigaCX. 
@_date: 2018-02-06 16:30:59
But now may be the time to buy to make that quick buck... 
@_date: 2017-10-29 22:40:21
I was thinking the same (only, much worse) about you. So I guess we'll agree to disagree.
@_date: 2017-10-29 20:39:38
Stupid is as stupid believes, in this case. 
@_date: 2017-10-29 21:31:08
Case in point! 
@_date: 2017-10-29 11:48:15
Apparently Richard Heart isn't very good at research, or maybe he's just not a smart person in general. He has only a few things partially correct in there. Can I get a link to his credentials, or anything relevant? He just seems like some random internet troll who thinks he knows a lot about stuff but doesn't, from what I can find. I also can write a bunch of nonsense if you wanna quote me. 
@_date: 2018-04-29 13:45:15
What the hell kind of physcho drugs are you on, and can I get some? 
@_date: 2017-10-29 18:46:43
Well I suppose I could write it all out. Or you could just go read all the available information for yourself. It's not hard to find and repeating it over and over because people are lazy seems pointless. These kind of people are always in the dark. No matter what. It's how they live. 
@_date: 2018-04-08 10:44:45
This is reddit. I think you're looking for twitter. 
@_date: 2018-04-26 01:17:33
.... You know you don't need to buy or own a full unit right? You can put $100 into bitcoin just as easily as anything else. It's no "cheaper".
@_date: 2017-05-16 08:57:52
Spoken like someone who has done next to no research of their own. 
@_date: 2018-04-24 22:11:54
This is turbo off topic. It's not even true. I've spent a shit load, directly, on boat loads of stuff. Why is this bullshit so up voted? 
@_date: 2017-05-06 20:02:58
Agreed. A HF is an awful idea. Activate SegWit now.
