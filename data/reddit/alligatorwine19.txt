So I went to my bank and eventually they were able to give me an update. They sent the money back to the IBAN it came from on the 26th of June by SWIFT payment. They game me the IBAN so at least I have it as a reference. Still no sign of anything in my Coinbase account. I've opened up another support ticket with Coinbase as I didn't get any response from my replies to the original email I got from their *support* team.

Yes, it's a normal practice here. You get a better rate if you deposit regular amounts up to a limit.
Called bank twice. They say they can't do a trace their end and that coinbase should be able to do that. The support from coinbase is abysmal for a company that processes so much FIAT and is supposed to be licensed. The bank says it is probably in a holding account belonging to coinbase so they should be able to at least confirm that

For clarity I'm based in Europe,  so this was a transfer to a European bank. I had coverted from BTC to USDC a few days previously then decided to cash out the USDC, so was trying to send this to my bank account. The issue I think was due to me trying to send over €1000 worth of currency to an account that would only allow a deposit of €1000 per month (which had already been maxed out for that month). I'm just getting very impatient (and worried)for the money to bounce back into my coinbase account and am very frustrated with the level of support received from coinbase.

Yeah, that's good advice, thanks. Nothing like speaking in-person. I'll try to call in tomorrow. In the meantime I'll just keep an eye on my coinbase account and hopefully the money returns
