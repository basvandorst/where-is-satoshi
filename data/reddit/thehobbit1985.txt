In Israel there's a company called Bitgo.co.il who already thought about this and implemented it on an existing POS system that is already deployed in ~1100 businesses in Israel.
There's a video showing just that:  , the video's in Hebrew but English subs are available.

Since the miners fee are enforced as usual, and the "extra" data that is send to the blockchain is only 40 bytes per transaction, I can't see how it will create bloat and spam

In reality, the actual community that develops all the different colored-coins protocols is pretty small (just the developers) so we are still in a time when it's not that hard to get a consensus between all of them.
Rather now when there is still a single digit number on implementations :)

The fact that you think only about the elevator pitch is what driving you to think like you do.
Most meetings with investors go for longer then 5 min which get a lot deeper into the details of what exactly is presented.
There is also a matter of what team you have and investors will always prefer to go with a team that has a proven success record.

Your missing the point that Colu is trying to develop a real life, non monetary usage for the blockchain for people who have no idea what bitcoin is or have no desire to use it as a currency.
Correct me if i'm wrong but I don't know of any Bitcoin 2.0 protocol that has any usage that is not by hardcore bitcoiners.

Bitcoin by it's nature, as a decentralized system provide the benefit of not having any single point of failure plus the really cool feature of not having to trust anyone.
Let me ask you a different question, would you want to have your car keys/house key in the hands a single company that you need to ask for their approval each time you want access?

The bitcoin network comes with the security provided by one hell of a mining network with a shitload of hashing power.
And actually building your own system designed from the ground up to fit your special needs can be easier then to try and implement those features upon someone else's system.
