No, David had nothing to do with the creation of Bitcoin, not in the slightest. He may have mined Bitcoins and co-operated with CSW's so called Bitcoin bank, which never eventuated, but that is all.

I just watched the interview.  How anyone could make head or tails of anything he said is beyond me. Kudos to the interviewer for staying awake!

Nothing wrong with heavy accumulation.. Bitcoin needs it, more than ever.   Unfortunately Bitcoin wasn't built as a stable coin, the way it was made means it needs massive price increases before it can stabilise to a point where it can be used as currency. Price increase will come with accumulation, hodling and speculator activity. Thats the truth of the matter, like it or not.

Craig has a history of taking people to court then dropping the charges.. His manufactured story about buying bank SW and gold from Mark Ferrier was a scam to fool the tax department. Meanwhile Mark said he has neither seen nor heard of a Craig Wright. Craig dropped the charges  ..
