Read this thread. Slowly. Look at all the things people have to say. Go through peoples' posting histories and see what they have to say.
Then, realize that the vast majority of (and bitcoiners) have no fucking idea what they're talking about.

Sorry for the late reply. Yes, your site was a hit with Sophos, as the other poster said. Likely a false positive, but if there's anything Bitcoin has taught me, it's that you need to be borderline paranoid (/s, kind of).
It seems like this virus exploits JavaScript and/or HTML iframes to execute code on a target computer.

So you're saying that several keystones of Bitcoin commerce are now under major scrutiny?


The Bitcoin protocol is great, but have you ever heard the phrase, "a chain is only as strong as its weakest link?" Right now lazy coders' mistakes have jeopardized many peoples' bitcoin holdings.


Such bullshit. There is a ton that is wrong with bitcoin right now. Whether those things can be fixed and whether bitcoin will recover is anyone's guess.


Take a good look in the mirror. Who's spreading misinformation now?

It's not the content of the post you're going to be downvoted for, it's for the manner in which you've decided to post it.  Getting butthurt after a couple of downvotes... yeah.

He is a troll, but he has a point.  It's idiotic to look at log-scaled graphs and say "less variance between 1000 and 10000 compared to between 0 and 0.1 must mean less variance overall."  It's really, really fucking stupid.  People try to shape graphs to look the way that they want them to look -- and this seems to happen all the time in this circlejerk sub.
I'm not a financial analyst, but I use statistics and math every day and log-scaled things come in handy when you are trying to scale things to look nicer in graphs.  Models -- different story but essentially the same concept -- when you work over several orders of magnitude it helps you linearize things and is more manageable.
p.s. I too would like BTC to go to da moon. I would also like people to show a little more common sense.

Thank you. I'm tired of the whole "DPR is a humanitarian" shtick. The dude made hundreds of thousands of BTC... for himself.

I think the issue is that people confuse reality with ideals and what they want. For example, this is why darknet market scams/hacks are such a big deal. Real BTC gets stolen, and that affects the price of bitcoin and confidence in BTC. The protocol may be solid, but if the users of the protocol introduce mistakes into the services layered on top of the protocol, the effectiveness of the protocol is weakened. After all, what is bitcoin without its services?

Do any of those things justify the markup? As a consumer I fail to see the worth of your price premium. Are your keys less prone to failure than the average USB key (critical for cold storage wallets imo)? Do they have a better warranty than the standard USB key? How do I know you'll be around to honor the warranty in a year?
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:20:40
Is this the same key I can buy for half price or even less at major retailers, and for 1/10 of that price on those Chinese websites?

Are you kidding me? Does the housing bubble suggest that houses are worthless? Bitcoin's prices are obviously being driven by speculation at the moment. This means that bitcoin price variance is a risky thing; but people say, "oh no bitcoin is a sure thing that will be worth $500000 by end of 2014," or some other unsubstantiated crap. Then other people come to jerk them off, "this crash is like all the others, expect 500% increase in value in the next month."
Point is, people need to acknowledge things for what they are. You can't predict the future. To me, the shills are the people who hype up bitcoin to the financially uninitiated. There were people telling a teenage kid to throw his college savings into bitcoin at $1200. I am just suggesting that people need to become rational investors -- and this will actually help the real long-term valuation of bitcoin.

Went 400 down from highs, 400 down again, 200 up from lows, 100 down from that. Advanced calculus analysis tells us that's -700ish man.  We still have 700$ of growth to get back to $1200.  All guaranteed profits man

I'm assuming you have a csv read in as a data frame?  Here's something that might help with standard errors incorporated.  You're going to need ggplot2 and maybe some of it's dependencies? (Sorry, also been a while since I've used ggplot).
    BTC = read.csv('filename.csv',sep='\t') # sep=',' or whatever other delimiter if applicable
    qplot(time, price, data=BTC)  dots only
    model &lt;- lm(price ~ time, data=BTC)  this code is to make the regression and standard error lines (±1 STDEV)
    grid &lt;- with(BTC, expand.grid(time = seq(min(time), max(time), length = 20), price = levels(factor(price))))
    grid$price &lt;- stats::predict(model, newdata=grid)
    err &lt;- stats::predict(model, newdata=grid, se = TRUE)
    grid$ucl &lt;- err$fit + 1.96 * err$se.fit
    grid$lcl &lt;- err$fit - 1.96 * err$se.fit
    qplot(time, price, data=BTC) + geom_smooth(aes(ymin = lcl, ymax = ucl), data=grid, stat="identity")  points with regression and ~std err.

"Libertarian financial experts"
The irony is that the market is actually making them pay for their idiocy. 
@_date: 2013-12-17 23:11:40
Yes, you are right. You can only do so much to help others from losing their money foolishly, and a lot of people have ignored sound financial advice cause of the speculation craze.
I do have a sound reason as to why I'm trying to discourage people from speculating on bitcoin.  Right now bitcoin (and cryptocurrencies in general) are receiving a lot of attention from the general public. Right now we are viewed as a bunch of money-crazy speculators, and they're not wrong in their assessment. If we want to build peoples' confidence in bitcoin, to the point where the big players as well as everyday people feel comfortable buying bitcoin (e.g. bitcoin as the ultimate wealth transfer medium), then we shouldn't allow ourselves to be depicted as simply speculators.
I do admit that this might be a lost cause, and that the reasoning is a bit circular, but the value of bitcoin isn't simply just going to go 'near the moon' or 'elsewhere.' It's value will depend upon how we treat it. If it continues to be plagued by speculators and there is 20% weekly variance in its price, what investor is going to say, "what a wonderful new paradigm?"
I think the best comparison to bitcoin are the different stages of a business startup. Google 'stages of a startup' and you will see what I mean. There are a lot of risks and pitfalls, and there is a lot of reward for early investors. It won't just "happen" by magic, though -- it'll take conscious effort from bitcoin holders to inspire others to adopt.
@_date: 2013-12-18 16:31:16
You don't get it. Bitcoin is fascinating and innovative. I want it to catalyze change.
However, these speculative bubbles make bitcoin a terrible investment and a terrible vehicle for wealth transfer. Would you be willing to store wealth, or even transfer wealth, knowing that you could lose 10-20% overnight? This is why bitcoin, although great on paper, is not going to appeal to many.
Disclaimer: I sold my bitcoins at $1100 because I felt they were maasively overvalued then.
@_date: 2013-12-18 09:04:15
Welcome to the place where you get downvoted for calling bitcoin a bubble, even AFTER the fact.

You know, there's a lot of people on here who people call "bitcoin shills," "government shills," "bank shills," or "Chinese shills"...
I've got a simpler explanation for you: they're just all idiots with selfish interests in mind.  No one is paying these people to shitpost to Reddit.
@_date: 2013-12-05 08:53:14
Yes, this is something like it.  I don't know much financial math so I've got some reading to do.  I did find this, though:
Something like this should be pretty easy to implement and worth a try?
@_date: 2013-12-17 16:03:06
See my comment above. In a nutshell, no one knows, but the price variation suggests that bitcoin's value is driven by speculation. To simply ignore that and say that bitcoin will be worth tens of thousands is foolish; to bet amounts of money you can't lose on that is idiotic; and to tell others there is no risk is... is there a word that describes televangelists?
@_date: 2013-12-22 04:24:42
It's a great idea, therefore I'm asking you to tell me about it some more. Care to oblige?
@_date: 2013-12-17 02:56:23
What about the circlejerk here?  
"We're not in a bubble!  Look at this log-scaled graph and tell me we're in a bubble!" (protip: a linear log-scaled graph is really exponential growth)
We are clearly in a speculative bubble and there are corrections occurring.  But many people refuse to acknowledge these things, despite all the signs.
I'm all for bitcoin and I want it to succeed, but this sub is full of people who want bitcoins to be their Golden Ticket and refuse to hear any argument to the contrary.
TO DA MOON!
