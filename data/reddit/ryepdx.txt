I know Ethereum is planning on enabling a two-way peg with Bitcoin (among other coins) as soon as Bitcoin's blockchain can support it. You'll still only be able to stake with ether, but you'll be able to pay for contract execution with bitcoin. Not sure if you'd consider that a sidechain, but it seems close enough to me.

Because when you've signed the transaction yourself and put it on the blockchain yourself, you know you're getting what you asked for. There aren't humans holding the money and doing whatever they like with it, regulations be damned. The blockchain does exactly what you ask it to do. And you don't have to pay it as much, which is nice.


I don't think it'll entirely replace the banking sector myself. I think it has the potential to replace a good chunk of it, and I think it has the potential be a lot more reliable and transparent. But someone still has to play matchmaker for all the parties involved. As for the bits it replaces, I know that it's possible to do time-locked transactions, and transactions locked by external oracles, which opens up the possibility of automatically executing wills, as well as futures and options. And you could also execute loans and trustless escrow on the blockchain instead of behind the closed doors of a bank.

That's cool. I like the checksum idea. I'd seen Electrum's implementation of this, but wasn't happy with their choice of 128 as an ENT value and didn't like that it'd take over 20 words to encode 256 bits using a 2,048 word list. Hadn't actually read the BIP at all, though, so I didn't realize it included a checksum. That said, maybe I'll make a fork of keyphrase that implements BIP-0039. I *do* like the words on Electrum's list better.

I would rather trust an uninsured Bitcoin exchange with cryptographically-proven open books than one I'm supposed to just trust without a foundation for that trust. Nobody is free from market forces, and nobody is free from the corrupting influence of power. The FDIC can fail just as banks can fail. And I don't honestly trust them to pay up in the event we have a large-scale banking collapse. Even in small matters I expect them to fight tooth and nail to *not* pay *anything*. That's just how large human organizations do things. Assuming that they only exist to enrich and continue themselves is generally a good rule of thumb. And anyway, if I happen to have funds above the insurance cut-off, I'm SOL. If I've got good cryptography backing my funds, I'm fine.
I dunno. I trust hard, simple mechanics more than large, incomprehensible collections of human relationships. You can fake books, pull guarantees out of thin air, and lie your face off, but you can't fake cryptography.
**Edit:** Sterling examples of why I feel this way can be found in [this thread](
**Edit 2:** I should probably also note that I *don't* trust exchanges or other centralized entities with large chunks of my bitcoin. I secure it myself, and so far I've done alright doing so.

Mine too! I tried reading it first in 2008/2009, but I was in college at the time and couldn't quite make it. Schoolwork was more of a priority, and I was too sleep-deprived to make it through the parts where we lays out his formal systems without basically dozing off. But last month I finally got tired of it sitting on my shelf and managed to plow through it in a few weeks, taking notes along the way. It's pretty dense, and the bits where he lays out the rules for this or that formal system are pretty dry, but it was overall a great read. Well-worth the time and effort to finish, IMO.
I also found that having read "I Am a Strange Loop" beforehand helped quite a bit. He goes over a lot of the same ideas in both books, though he does delve far, far deeper into them with GEB.

Bitcoin is a whole 'nother mess of worries, though. And those worries happen to be more pragmatic than, "oh darn, Fred Phelps thinks I'm going to hell now." Bitcoin's got a shady reputation, to the point where every person I've met and later offered to just *give* bitcoin to has acted like I was offering them drugs and flat-out refused.
People are worried about losing their money in a Mt. Gox-style implosion. People are worried about being targeted by the government or other powerful entities. Even if they are, as your pornstar/producer was, personally invested in it, they won't necessarily be comfortable associating themselves with it in public, juuuust in case it comes back to bite them later.

For me, the biggest net benefit accrues to all of society by creating a decentralized systems to replace the centralized ones that have resulted in so much abuse and power disparity recently. Bitcoin is more ethical in that it doesn't prop up the unethical power structures wreaking havoc in the world today. It's not the best possible system I think we could come up with, but it does at least beat out the banks and all the other financial industry middlemen.

There's a systemic component to this as well: developers of popular closed-source software can be (and often are) coerced into including and maintaining security holes for law enforcement to take advantage of. Closed source software can also be a repository for long-lived bugs protected from disclosure by DRM laws. And content publishers often have incentives to undermine user security as well in order to protect their "intellectual property," as Sony did over ten years ago by including malware on all their music CDs that automatically rootkitted the computers they were inserted into.
Reforming our DRM and intellectual property laws while also insisting on open source *everything* could go a long way toward building a safer world for everyone. Especially those of us who rely on computers in any form doing what we ask and staying healthy.

Honestly, I don't see any reason why hedging couldn't be automated using exchanges that support shorting and run from a user's own computer. At that point you're trusting the exchanges, though. Ultimately we've got to figure out a decentralized solution for advanced trading. Mastercoin and Ethereum might actually enable this, but I haven't looked into them deeply enough yet to know for sure. Ripple might also be a useful piece, if they're really as decentralized as I hear they've finally become.

Well, yeah. But I think that would just entail remembering what function you used. The only ones you *should* be using are ones that have been published by a scientific body such as the NIST, implemented in most of the common languages, and used in a variety of applications for a long period of time. And you're probably fine just using SHA-256 like almost everyone else does, since you're guaranteed to get a valid secp256k1 key from that function every time. (Its maximum output size is 32 bytes long, while the upper bound of sepc256k1 is 64 bytes long.)
If you're slightly more paranoid, you could also use SHA-512, though that one's maximum output size is 64 bytes long and *may* end up producing a hash larger than sepc256k1'os upper bound.

Best possible way that's accessible to most people: use a coin or a 16-sided die. With a coin, you'd be flipping and converting the flips to binary. With a 16-sided die, you'd be converting the rolls to hexadecimal. Then use that number as your seed on an offline computer.
Really should put together a live Linux image to make this easier for people. Mycelium's solution looks interesting, but I'm not sure how random RAM noise actually is. I imagine it'd naturally follow some kind of uneven distribution. But I haven't made a study of it or anything.

"I have nothing to hide" is a terrible reason to give up your personal power. In doing so, you contribute to a climate where everyone is more vulnerable to abuses of power. Where MasterCard and Visa have the power to decide what you can and can't buy with your wages, and where they may be inclined to exercise their power to gain even *more* power via those kinds of blockades and service slowdowns.
And you make the rather large assumption that you will *never* have anything to hide. Maybe one day the government changes, or the information you gave away falls into the wrong hands. Nobody is a criminal until one day they *are*. Until one day someone with power decides that their existence is inconvenient and that they need to go away for a while, or until someone with power wants something done and changes the legal landscape to get it.
Don't feel safe and secure just because you're "in the right," whether that be legally, morally, or both. Being "in the right" does not protect you from people who, quite simply, just want to exercise power over you for their own enrichment. It probably won't be personal, but you'll still personally suffer for it. The only thing that protects you is your awareness of the flow of power in your environment and your ability to navigate it. Bitcoin is an effective tool for navigating those flows of power because it keeps your personal power *personal*.

I'd thought about that myself, to be honest. Those *are* two different questions. I chose the definition I chose because it's the one I've seen used in most other places. It makes sense if you conceive of this inquiry as a sort of measure of how well you're doing compared to everyone else participating. It's like thinking about Bitcoin as a game where the goal is to accumulate as much BTC as possible. If a person doesn't have any, they aren't participating and so you can't very well think of yourself as "beating" them.
Not a proper economic definition, IMO, but the one most people seem to be operating on.

Not only this, but any automated system like this is going to face significant hurdles regarding that particular piece due to the infinite ways information can be encoded. Can it recognize that a text file and a JPEG and a PDF contain the same information? Can it even recognize that a text file with Windows-style line breaks is the effectively the same as one with Unix-style line breaks? What if the information gets turned into a sound file? A video? A program?
Other than that, I do like this idea. A reputation system of some kind could potentially help with the problem I've pointed out, and maintaining some kind of global "reputation blockchain" to keep reputations and identities across platforms consistent would probably prove a decent solution to the problem you noted.

Primarily I think of blockchains as universally seeded torrents in these kinds of scenarios, but in this particular scenario I suppose it's entirely unnecessary.

Yeah, that would be pretty awesome for people who want to remain in the system, or work from within the system to reform it. The problem there is that then you have a set of "whitelisted" addresses and a set of "blacklisted" addresses. That could lead to a ridiculous mess and undermine a lot of the benefits of Bitcoin, such as the fact that it can't be censored. Just look at the furor surrounding CoinValidation, because it pretty much all applies to what you're suggesting.
Alternatively, I guess you could probably set up automatically self-taxing addresses. *That* would not require compromising Bitcoin's privacy at all. It *would* require paying taxes be entirely voluntary, of course. Not sure how sustainable a model that would prove. I suspect it wouldn't be sustainable at all.

(Emphasis mine.)
Our names *do* need to be accurate. Calling a program that guts schools "No Child Left Behind" sounds like the sort of alienating tactics you're talking about. But naming your product something that screams, "I'm a target, and you can be a target too if you use me" seems almost just as bad. Calling a service "Dark Market" makes that service very politically cheap to block, right out of the gate. It's an unnecessary handicap. We need to make our case to the mainstreet user and get them on board, or else we risk marginalizing ourselves and our tools. We need to do everything we can to make our tools *politically costly to block.*

The other part of your post has been addressed, so I'll just address this point.
The difficulty of mining coins automatically adjusts itself in response to how much power is being thrown at it. So the amount of mining power doesn't have a major effect on how fast coins get mined. Primarily, more mining power in more hands means more security for the network. It means it's harder for any one actor to get enough hardware to out-compete 50% of the whole mining network and conduct a "51% attack."
The difficulty of mining adjusts itself such that it always tends toward one block being mined every ten minutes. There's a little bit of slippage due to hardware coming online between adjustments so that the average has been a bit closer to 8 minutes per block in practice, but the raw amount of power involved really makes little difference in how *fast* the bitcoin gets released. The projected schedule based on a 10 minute block time can be found on [the Bitcoin Wiki]( According to the table on the wiki, just over 93% of all the bitcoin that will ever exist will have been mined by 2020. The last bitcoin to ever be mined will be mined in 2140, a little more than 125 years from now.

After looking at the brain wallet solutions out there, I was somewhat disappointed to see that there didn't appear to be anything open source and client side that provided a ~~reasonable~~ literal 1-to-1 mapping of Bitcoin's private key space to phrases. So I spent the weekend writing one!
Each word in the phrase this utility produces represents 16 bits in the underlying private key. Thus any 256-bit private key, such as the ones that Bitcoin uses, can be represented using a sixteen word phrase.

Why are you even running a mining farm? The margins are, at best, razor thin right now. By my (admittedly lazy) calculations, the margins are actually *negative*, especially if figured in bitcoin (as they should be, since mining is financially identical to buying bitcoin options).

That's what I do, generally. I buy a bunch, then spend some (less than I'd bought, usually) over a few months, and then I buy more. I prefer doing things in bulk rather than burning a bunch of time with lots of little transactions. But different people prefer different habits.
Not sure if you'd be saving much in transaction costs my way, though. IIRC, Coinbase charges a percentage fee. There's also a $0.15 bank fee, but that should really be a negligible percentage of your transaction. If it isn't, you should probably start buying back your spent bitcoin in more widely spaced increments.

The problem with that is it results in an uneven distribution. In your example, the numbers 1 through 4 (or 0 through 3, with the way I'm doing it) would have slightly higher probabilities of appearing in your key than the other numbers, which makes your key slightly more predictable and not *really* random. If I were given a bunch of keys generated with d20 rolls modulo 16 and a bunch of other keys with truly random distributions, the two would not be indistinguishable. I would be able to detect a pattern in your modulo 16 keys and thus be able to improve my odds of guessing your keys by taking that pattern into account.

I am personally in favor of satoshi, but even "bits" is better than continuing with this "fractions of a 'whole coin'" nonsense, IMO. Never fight more than one battle at a time, if you can help it. Getting people on board with Bitcoin is hard enough without also having to fight a basic tenet of human psychology.
The thought of bending to an irrational part of the human mind used to irk me, but now I realize that my irritation with that thought was itself irrational. The most rational thing we can do is switch to something smaller as soon as possible. We don't all have to go to bits, and we don't all have to go to satoshi. But those should be the two we go to, IMO, and the sooner the better.

The way you ask this question kinda rubs me the wrong way, to be honest, and I'm going to address that first. You ask if Bitcoin is a good thing to get involved with "at [your] age." Don't ever let your age hold you back from accomplishing things or planning for your future. If anyone tries to tell you you're too young to be doing what you're doing, ignore them. Good decisions are good decisions at any age, and the same goes for bad decisions. Thinking you should be doing certain things just because you're a certain age can hold you back from realizing your full potential.
The caveat, of course, is that your brain isn't done developing yet, so you're not going to be as good at making decisions now as you will be in the future. That's why society puts up guardrails around you and tries to tell you what is and isn't appropriate for your age. But ultimately you've got to think for yourself and judge what things society's got a point about and what things they're just wrong on.
IMO, learning how to manage your money and use it to make more money is a good decision at any age. Depending on how you go about that, you might end up losing a bunch of it initially. The good news is that you're 14, which means you've probably got a lot of life left to recover from those mistakes and capitalize on what those mistakes have taught you. At 14, you're in a better place to start learning and making mistakes than someone who's older. Really, I think that's probably the only way your age is relevant in this context.
I'm bullish on Bitcoin. I've got a lot of it, too. Most of my wealth is in Bitcoin. But I've only been doing this finance thing for a few years now. I'd personally recommend anyone with a little money to spare put some of it into Bitcoin, you included. I believe in its long-term potential and my money is where my mouth is. But don't buy it just because a bunch of Internet strangers said you should. In the end, you've got to find something more solid to convince yourself. In my opinion, anyway. :-)

I think I know what you're talking about. The problem is that your provably secure software is, in all likelihood, going to have to run on a system or in an environment that is *not* provably secure. And you can always jump up (or down) a layer of abstraction. There's *always* a way in. The question is whether you can make breaching the system costly enough to ruin the value proposition for attackers.
Which is not to say that provably secure software is a waste of time. It *is* to say that treating security like a destination one can "arrive" at is foolish. Security is an ongoing process. Security is a continuum. Your system's security lies at some point along an asymptote of "absolute security's" straight line.

Can you clarify a bit? Given our current trajectory, I believe it is entirely necessary and appropriate. Is there something in play that you believe will change our trajectory away from increasing wealth/power inequality? And how will it do so?


I don't think the issue here is that there are people with bad intentions in charge. I think it certainly doesn't help, but the fact remains that the *system itself* is broken. If we replaced every ill-intentioned actor in power today with well-intentioned ones but kept our system the same, I think we would be back where we are now in due time. The system at present *favors* selfish actors, who are for all means and purposes just as bad as ill-intentioned ones. (In fact, I suspect a lot of the people you likely consider ill-intentioned I would simply categorize as highly self-interested, or sociopathic.)

Granted. But for most people, the line between online software and offline software is blurry. And if the RNG brainwallet.org uses is in fact cryptographically weak, then running it offline wouldn't have made any difference. Strong RNG is not as common as it really should be, and it's foolish to assume that any RNG is strong, *especially* if it doesn't collect any "real-world" entropy. And even if it does collect real-world entropy, how it uses that entropy matters a lot as well.
Dice are the best RNGs available to most people, IMO. (Leaving the door open for other RNGs I haven't heard about yet with that statement, of course.) Generating a bitcoin address with dice can be pretty painstaking, though, and you'll still need a secure, offline computer to run the hashes and key generation.

I think the hardest two pieces of this might be "WTF is a redemption script" and "how do I get my public key?" Most bitcoin wallets don't give any insight into the public keys underlying your bitcoin addresses.
**Edit:** Also, the key ordering piece seems superfluous and should probably either be gotten rid of or hidden behind an "advanced" tab. While I realize that key order matters in multi-sig, that's a detail that should probably be handled by convention rather than configuration in most cases.
**Edit 2:** "Provided Public Keys" could also be gotten rid of. Just allow the user to add and remove "public key" fields up to some limit and get that number from the number of public key fields. And adjust the options for "N" as fields are added and removed. And require that all public key fields created by the user be either filled in or removed, to avoid N being greater than M.
**Edit 3:** And why not get rid of the "Get Public Keys From" field as well? Split up the manual and redemption script functionality into two utilities/pages, since I imagine the use cases for the two are going to be different anyway.

Yeah, that would be pretty cool. I know that wifi routers are pretty easy to track down, though. On my college campus, that was one of the IT department's jobs. (Though I admit there'd probably be more hand-wringing over people's doors being kicked in than over satellites being shot down.)
I was thinking that the satellites could be like Bitcoin miners. A company designs them, open sources and/or franchises the design, and then people launch them for fun and profit. Or, I suppose, a company could design and launch their own satellites, if they're willing to take on the risk. Either way, it could be a way for people to make bitcoin and prove one of Bitcoin's unique value propositions.
As for the high ping times, I suspect that satellites could make up for that with coverage. Large wifi-router mesh nets tend to not work very well, as I understand it, due to the high number of jumps required to get from one point to another. For communicating across countries and continents, I think satellites are far and away the way to go. Ideally, of course, there would be a system of wifi routers and satellites working together. I don't think either one would work very well alone.

You got downvoted by someone, but you're basically right. More precisely, ~61% of the world's population doesn't have Internet access.
75% of the world's population had mobile phones, though, as of 2012. That does at least open up the majority of the world to using SMS-based wallets, though those come with their own particular sets of risks as well.

Not sure if you're right about this one. It *would* increase the probability of a recurrence a little (though probably not by much, since they probably weren't specifically targeted), but they would also *hopefully* be better prepared for a recurrence. They would have offline, offsite backups somewhere.
Right now their choice seems to be, "pay the extortionists or go out of business." These aren't people threatening to burn down a building. You can relocate if a building burns down. Lawyers can work from home. As long as they have their data, they can keep working on cases. But without their data, they're in a much trickier situation. Without their data, they're looking at a lot of lost face and re-gathering data from clients *at best.* And that could literally mean the end of their business.
In this case, the best course of action would seem to be to pay a couple hundred dollars and then take steps so this sort of thing never fucking happens again. But y'know, that's just me. I don't study crime or law or anything.

There isn't a roomful of men in suits somewhere who can be paid off to subvert the whole system unilaterally. Yes, every system is corruptible.

@_date: 2014-06-26 23:53:49
After reading about the [person who lost 35 BTC]( possibly because of a bad RNG, I decided to brush off my C skills and make a small CLI utility to take values from a source capable of generating random numbers and create a hexadecimal string from them. This is similar to [dice-wallet]( except it's feeding the random values directly into the private key instead of relying on SHA-256 to maintain the randomness of the dice rolls.
This would be pretty cool to turn into a bootable utility for offline wallet generation, but I don't have the skills or the time for that at the moment. You can do the rest of the wallet building with the Unix utilities you get with most live images anyway.
**Edit:** Because this utility converts the input values directly into binary, you're going to need to use a random number source whose maximum value is some power of 2. So that means a coin, a 4 sided die, an 8 sided die, a 16 sided die, etc. It's not all that user friendly, I admit, but the point here isn't user-friendliness. The point is to minimize the number of factors that could potentially compromise the key's randomness. Going directly from die-roll/coin-flip values to binary does exactly that. Using an algorithm to map the output of, say, a six-sided die to pure binary would almost certainly result in creating a non-random distribution of values.
**Edit 2:** Added instructions on the Github page on how to turn your assuredly-random hexadecimal key into a Bitcoin address.
**Edit 3:** Note that this utility does not check to make sure your shiny new private key conforms to the [secp256k1 ECDSA standard]( required by Bitcoin. You have to do that yourself by requesting a key no larger than 256 bits and by making sure the hexadecimal key you generate is no larger than `FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFF FFFFFFFE BAAEDCE6 AF48A03B BFD25E8C D0364141`. I purposely left that check out because I want this utility to be able to potentially generate hexadecimal keys that work for other standards as well.

Given the level of transparency available with Bitcoin, I am disappointed that the lack thereof was not a show stopper for the executive team. But I cannot judge them too harshly, since I might have likewise been taken in by Danny if I'd been in the same position.

Probably because they need a novel mining algorithm for their system to work. Anything that uses Bitcoin has to work with the SHA256 POW scheme, and there is just isn't a way to make something like Maidsafe work under that scheme. Not without a bunch of tortured, complicated workarounds, anyway. And I'm sure there are other advantages as well in terms of having more flexibility with regard to the scripting language used.

They can coerce open-source project maintainers, poison binary package repos, or have tools compiling in backdoors[1] .
Yeah, true enough. I think the clincher is that (AFAIK) we have more concrete examples of closed-source software being used as the delivery mechanism for those sorts of exploits than we do open-source software. And powerful or not, it's harder to do something in secret in environments where transparency is the norm, where there are more windows into activity you need to hide from.
Again, there will *always* be attack vectors. Eliminating all attack vectors is unfeasible. The goal, as always, is just to limit your exposure to risk. Open source software and hardware helps do that in a big way.

There have been a lot of attempts at federated social media solutions. I think that approach is played out. As soon as I finish the paid work I'm currently doing, maybe even before then, I plan on beginning work on a true peer-to-peer social network. I've been reading and researching the subject for a few months now and feel I've just about got a good enough grip on things to take a decent swing at it.
The technology, as it turns out, isn't all that complicated. Monetizing these endeavors is really the hard part. Most money-seeking endeavors rely on creating chokepoints, or points of centralization. A service that respects you as a consumer and that protects your privacy by making it impossible for the service's stewards to do otherwise cannot engage in these tactics. Thus they rely on people consentually, voluntarily giving up some of their resources and currency to help the project.
Even blockchain-based projects rely on creating a chokepoint to monetize themselves. Access to the blockchain requires purchasing a token, which these days often comes directly from the developers via an "IPO." The blockchain itself is decentralized, which puts it a step ahead of other money-seeking endeavors, but it still technically constitutes a point of centralization that can cause problems for people's privacy if too much is entrusted to it. You can't really have forward-secrecy, for example, if all the messages ever distributed in a system are recorded for all eternity in a blockchain. Or even if all the messages get distributed to all the nodes in the network, since an attacker can then keep a private record of those messages.
It's certainly possible to achieve a degree of privacy on the blockchain, but for purposes of keeping *messages* secure, I have come to believe that the model is wholly insufficient in itself. For it to really work, it has to pair with some form of non-global messaging. Some form of side-channeling.
So monetization as it is traditionally done on the Internet and decentralization seem to be fundamentally set against each other. You can't have one *and* the other. If I start a peer-to-peer project and it gains traction, the only chance it'll have of continuing into the future is if I can monetize it via side channels. If I can make enough through donations, speaker's fees, and selling swag, then I will be able to stay on it indefinitely. If not, I'll eventually be forced to give up the reins to other volunteers (if I've managed to attract any by then) while I re-enter the workforce to replenish my reserves.
These are, of course, only my opinions as of this moment. I admit I haven't dug yet into Bitmessage as much as I'd like to have, so I reserve the right to be proven wrong and to change my opinion on blockchains in particular. It feels weird that I feel like I need to say this, but the Internet is very good at preserving opinions forever and then resurrecting those opinions at the least possibly opportune times. Opinions change, and I would be quite happy to be proven wrong on anything I've written here.

Honestly, the legal language around Bitcoin is pretty mismatched with the reality. Nobody actually holds bitcoin. We just hold keys that allow us to reassign bitcoin to other keys on the blockchain. A minor detail in most scenarios, but the law should probably be as precise as it can be in order to avoid ambiguities like these.

Why the downboat? It's a legitimate observation. The system described implies centralization (palm scans) and would be *totally* vulnerable in the manner implied. Better would be timed-release transactions to addresses *known* to belong to the heirs. A cache of transactions that are *literally* not valid until certain block heights are reached would be a lot more secure than a system that reads a palm scan and then creates a transaction using a private key ferreted away on a server somewhere.

To be a bit more precise, the "certain numeric range" is called the target, not the difficulty. The target and difficulty are inversely related so that when difficulty rises, the target falls.

I think building better systems that can outcompete the old systems is a much more sustainable course of action.

Usually you can tell from context when speaking in person. Having a distinction in print just makes it a bit clearer.
As for "Blockchain," I'd say that should be lowercase. Every cryptocurrency has a blockchain, so it's a generic name instead of a specific name. Plus using the uppercase increases the odds of it being confused with Blockchain.info.
Edit: Besides, the blockchain is just the store of data Bitcoin uses. The Bitcoin protocol is what clients on the network use to communicate with each other. And the whole system taken together is Bitcoin. I feel like using "blockchain" to refer to the protocol when it already refers to Bitcoin's collective database makes the whole system harder to make sense of.
@_date: 2014-06-21 18:28:56
While I agree that this does undermine one of Bitcoin's primary appeals for people like you and me, not everyone can handle being their own bank or even *wants* to handle being their own bank. I'm okay with the majority of people using things like Coinbase so long as the door stays open for people like us who prefer securing and holding their own wallets.
Aside from that, does make a valid point regarding the relatively flat transaction volume on the network: if a significant percentage of Bitcoin's current growth is coming from people using Coinbase and transferring primarily within the site, that growth would not be reflected in the transaction volume reported by Blockchain.info. You'll need to add internal movements to the transaction volume numbers to get a true reading, and that will unfortunately depend on getting honest numbers from players who have VC-bucks to gain from inflating those numbers.
However, I'd be super-skeptical of anyone pushing this argument without any data to back it up. While this *is* a possibility, there's no reason to believe that it's a reality. Bitcoin adoption over the past six months or so could very well have just been flat. (There is a notable spike around December of last year, which is why I don't feel comfort saying "the past year.") In fact, I'd say that the price action backs up this thesis. We've been seeing flat and falling prices that roughly match the flat transaction volume. This is exactly what one would expect when adoption/use falls off in a currency with as high a rate of monetary supply growth as Bitcoin currently has.
**Edit:** makes a good point about [the dataset OP is using on Blockchain.info]( Excluding popular addresses can help filter some of the noise from the signal, so to speak.

**1)** I can't speak with experience on how to handle paid shills and pumpers. Bring in someone who was with Occupy from the beginning to talk about what worked and what didn't work when they were trying to protect the movement from the government agents that'd infiltrated their ranks. They'll have a much better basis to talk about that particular problem.
That said, my own instinct is to drive the discourse away from emotion and back toward logic in all cases, since emotional people are easier to manipulate, and to practice heavy-handed moderation where all calls to violent action result in a ban. One of the foremost tools the US government has used to try discrediting people, from Occupiers to Muslims, is to goad them into taking violent action. As for the pumpers, it's just back to logic again. Practice your Mr. Spock. You've gotta be a Vulcan, and you've gotta help others become the same. Emotion is *not* your friend when it comes to discerning reality.
Finally, I don't think tying Bitcoin addresses to Reddit usernames will help in the slightest with determining whether people are genuine or not. Shills and trolls can own bitcoin too!
**2)** Expanding on *why* it's such a terrible idea: if I'm an extortionist and your suggestion becomes reality, then all I'd have to do is watch this subreddit for someone to post a signature from an address with enough bitcoin in it to be worth my while. I could then proceed to see how well-tied to their screen name their real world identity is, and if it is, I could then show up at their door with duct tape, a tire iron, and absolute certainty about the minimum size of their bitcoin stash. Even if their stash is not very large at the time of posting, if Bitcoin takes off, it could be *quite* significant later.
The NSA as an organization may be *less* interested in the tire-iron-and-duct-tape approach (can't speak for their individual agents, of course) but they sure as hell are interested in de-anonymizing people and gathering as much data about them as they can. Publicly tying a Bitcoin address to your Reddit username would only help them in that. And it would make it easier for them to de-anonymize others because now they've got one less unknown. They've got one more datapoint to draw inferences from. And if what you suggest becomes common practice, they'll end up with many such datapoints.

There's an incentive for ransomware developers to make ransomware that actually decrypts the data upon payment. If the ransomware gets a reputation for not actually decrypting upon payment, the deployers will see less income.
That said, I don't expect it to actually remove itself. I'd expect it to instead downgrade itself to a less obvious infection and then either continue to use the machine as an infection vector for other machines, or put the machine on some sort of botnet that they can then rent out to others.

Actually, that would be a really interesting use of sidechains. Basically you'd just modify the network's rules to allow a transaction to be reversed up until some number of blocks have been mined. Since there *is* a chargeback risk when accepting that particular coin, I imagine prices would be higher. But it'd be useful when trying a new vendor who could end up leaving you high and dry, as this one did.
Of course, the one issue there is that transactions would essentially have to be frozen until the chargeback period passes, unless you can find a robust and novel way of unwinding the chain of transactions from that chargeback. And if one *does* decide to go the simple (and probably best) route of just freezing the transaction until it "posts," one *could* just use a time-locked transaction and watch for the input transaction to be spent in order for a "chargeback" to register. Using a sidechain would be completely superfluous.

I'd agree with you on inflation if the money were actually being evenly distributed. It's not, though: it goes to the banks first. Because those people are closer to the "money spigot," it benefits them first of all.

True enough. I may not go my whole life without losing any bitcoin. I came damn close at one point when my hard drive failed and I didn't have any backups of the wallet on it. Managed to recover it, though, and I've been a lot more careful about keeping multiple backups ever since. But it's all about risk mitigation and knowing the risks of your environment. You're running Windows (I assume), so you are definitely wise to keep an antivirus program going at all times. I'm running Linux, so I don't have to worry about that as much. I also don't keep all my bitcoin in one wallet. Most of it is in an encrypted cold wallet I generated offline and have a couple copies of. Soon I'll have the thing cut into a stainless steel card. Most of the rest is on my mobile wallet, which has multiple encrypted backups in different locations, and in Coinbase (because I get referral commissions).
Using Bitcoin isn't analogous to running a Windows box without an antivirus, IMO. It's analogous to running a server containing sensitive information. You don't expect you'll never have an intruder. Instead, you lock down what you can as much as you can, and you set up multiple tiers of security hurdles and sandboxes and encrypted offsite backups to mitigate the damage done when something terrible finally *does* happen.
*&lt;shrug&gt;* For some people, "be your own bank" *is* a really stupid idea. But I don't think it's a stupid idea in itself.

They've never been very big on it. Honestly, what we're doing here goes against all traditional, solid investment advice. When you're investing, you don't want to try to predict the "next big thing." You don't want to try to *make* a market, or create a whole new industry. You don't want to take risks. Risks are how you *lose* money, more often than not.

The difference is that Bitcoin has enough traction at this point that the core devs *could* all die in a plane crash tomorrow and the project would continue. They could even all sell their bitcoin and wash their hands of everything; ignoring the potential additional effects of the *cause* of such an about-face, the project would continue.
Scamcoins exist only to part newbies from their money and then die. They offer "innovations" that amount to tweaking a couple variables in some other coin's core client to make for better marketing material (such as "faster confirmation times") with no regard for the effects of said changes, or else *promise* innovations with no intention of ever delivering. They're all about riding the coattails of Bitcoin's success and exploiting FOMA in newbies who aren't savvy enough to separate the wheat from the chaff, as it were.

I like to think that Bitcoin can be that currency. After all, we're talking about cultural issues here, not technical ones. And the majority of the world probably has a lot of the same qualms you do. It's just that in *this* particular scene, people like you are in the minority. (At least, I think so. Not sure if the suits outnumber the devs yet.)
There is really no reason we can't just start using something else, unilaterally. After all, there always has to be *someone* taking the first step. I personally believe in using satoshi as the primary denomination, so I do that when I can. I'm okay with "bits" too, though, so I'm pretty happy to see that one gaining traction. Both are leagues better than sticking with "bitcoin" as a denomination.

Given the right circumstances, I would. But there's a lot of unnecessary cruelty involved in the factory farm system as it stands, and I don't want to support that. I also draw the line at animals of sufficient intelligence. I eat wild-caught Alaskan fish once a month or so, which makes technically makes me a pescetarian (try dropping *that* word in a casual conversation sometime), but that's about it. Even when I ate meat, I avoided pork. It just seemed weird and inconsistent that we had such reservations about eating dogs when pigs were arguably just as intelligent, if not more.
If you really want to cause a firestorm, try bringing up the fact that pigs have a greater capacity for suffering than early-stage fetuses do in a pro-life circle jerk. People seem to get really offended when you bring that up. But it's such a massive hypocrisy, from my standpoint, to be anti-abortion and yet be fine with contributing to the suffering and slaughter of such intelligent animals.

Hmm... not sure it works like that. I mean, sure, if the virus came packaged with the software, you could sue the people responsible. But I don't imagine you could sue the software developers if *your* machine infects *their* software, regardless of whether the malware exploited a bug in their software to do so or not. There are other infection vectors besides executables, and I'd venture to guess that the vast majority of the successful malware out there uses subtler means of infection. And as the infection vectors get closed up, one would just keep issuing updates to one's malware to keep it alive and infectious.
The USB firmware infection vector (dubbed "BadUSB") in particular looks pretty intense. *That* one's going to take a good long while to go away.

Hey, I can only speak about the people *I've* interacted with. Yeah, there've been some interested people in the tech circles I hang out with, and my immediate family is also in the know, since I've been bugging them about it since 2011. But everyone I've interacted with outside those circles still seems to think of it as "Internet drug money." And even some of the tech-oriented people who understand it still deride it based on the social dynamics involved.
Jesus, I'm not defending the perspective. I'm just reporting that it is *there.* That I've run up against it in real life.
Anyway, if you're in a place where you don't have to advocate, that's great. But where I am, there are a lot of people who have a lot of negative associations with Bitcoin, and that *does* mean I have to advocate for it when it comes up. If I explain it *and they understand,* then they are usually brought on board pretty quickly. But it does seem to go over a lot of people's heads for whatever reason.

Define "profitable." How much bitcoin will you get over the lifetime of your farm versus if you had put the same amount of money into just buying bitcoin outright? 
**Edit:** Sorry, I guess I did move the goal posts a little there, as I was initially talking about "margin," which I assume most miners take to mean "bitcoin generated between electricity billing cycles * price of bitcoin - cost of electricity." So I *do* believe that most miners are still in the green by that metric. And while buying the equipment in the first place might have been a terrible investment decision, that's now a sunk cost that you can now only at best partially recoup by mining for as long as your margins are positive, or by reselling it to a "greater fool." And if you're thinking in terms of fiat, then maybe one day you'll make back the money you spent due to the rise in bitcoin price. But that'll never change the fact that you bought a machine that generated less bitcoin than you could have otherwise obtained by just buying the bitcoin on an exchange.

It'd be possible to do pretty nicely with wallets that can tie into social networks for connecting to each other and exchanging public keys. That way the only thing you'd have to do is connect up with all the people you want involved in a multisig, decide how many of that group are needed for a spending quorum, and then create the multisig address. Everything else could be handled behind the scenes.

I guess "completely offline" is just less fuzzy than "strongly encrypted." If I have an encrypted wallet online and someone gets ahold of it, I can't rule out the possibility that they'll one day manage to decrypt it. How "strongly" encrypted is it? And can I be sure that it will *always* be that strongly encrypted? Whereas if my wallet is offline, there's no way for a remote attacker to get at it.
But yeah, in an everyday, practical sense, there's really no difference between an encrypted wallet you never decrypt and a wallet you never connect to the Internet.

Honestly, I don't trust web wallets at all. I keep a little bitcoin in Coinbase these days because there's an excellent vegan delicatessen near my house that prefers Coinbase transactions, but that's it. The browser itself undermines whatever security you're trying to put into place (rogue addons and no code signing, oh joy!), and holding your private keys on a computer someone else controls (encrypted or not) just seems like an additional unnecessary risk to me.
Seriously, if you want impeccable security, you've got to ditch the browser and only use open source, peer-to-peer programs.

The merchant uses Coinbase to accept bitcoin, so when I pay with Coinbase the whole transaction is off-blockchain and "verifies" instantly.

Well, *I* don't. End-to-end encryption within the browser is better than nothing, but it's still insecure. If the server is ever compromised, all it takes is a little Javascript injection to get your private keys sent in the clear to the attacker. What happened to Jennifer Lawrence sucks, though IMO I think it shouldn't be a source of shame for her. It doesn't reflect on her character at all, though our fixation with the photos reflects on ours, and the hacker's compromising them reflects on theirs. That said, I do hope this is another nail in the coffin of cloud-based, centralized services. Peer-to-peer is the only shot we've got at reasonable security these days.

1. The IPO analogy is just an analogy. Ether is the closest thing to shares in Ethereum available at the moment. If Ethereum succeeds, the value of ether goes up. If it fails, it goes down. While you're technically right, there is no functional difference for the crowdsale participants.
2. I don't personally think you guys are a scamcoin. You're delivering completely new functionality in a blockchain format. That said, the word "scam" has been spread thin enough in the Bitcoin community that it now covers vaporware. MasterCoin is likewise not a scam, but it's being referenced as such in [another comment in this thread]( That's the perception around it, because the tokens ended up falling in value. People aren't looking at alts as new pieces of technology. People are looking at them as money-making opportunities. Anything that fails to deliver by *that* metric is, to them, a scam.
3. It's always hard to judge other people's motivations. That might not have been your motivation, and it might not have been a *voiced* motivation on the part of the people surrounding you. But it might have been a motivation that influenced the outcome of that decision all the same. In my opinion, the motivation doesn't matter. What matters is what happens after the BitLicense regulation goes into effect. If the motivation really was to avoid the chilling effect it will have if it goes into effect as-is, fine. Any investor who doesn't take that potential outcome into account deserves their losses. The burden of due diligence is *not* on the person offering the security. I accept that the price of ether *could* drop because of that regulation. I have ether because I'm interested in Ethereum as a technology, not as a money-making opportunity. I want to build on the platform. This is the same reason I and many others got into Bitcoin back in 2011. What the price does short-term is irrelevant from that perspective, as long as the regulation does *not* lead the core team to shutter development. So, if Ethereum becomes illegal in many countries, are you willing to say "fuck it" and continue in spite of that? Is the project fragile, or anti-fragile? The number of meatspace-identified actors on your team makes me somewhat nervous. However, I don't think Ethereum will be considered illegal in most places anytime soon, so this is mostly an academic consideration as far as I'm concerned. I think there'll be enough time for a gradual exodus into anonymity if necessary.

I think we disagree on how much trouble could be caused by a mining monopoly. Again, a mining monopoly would turn a lot of people off of Bitcoin, myself included. While the potential mass exodus triggered by the monopoly could itself result in the fall of the monopoly, the fact that there *was* a monopoly in the first place could serve to keep most people out of the system afterward. It would at the very least serve as a limiting factor for Bitcoin's future. It could also result in a competing coin eating Bitcoin's lunch. Which, you know, if Bitcoin gets outcompeted fair and square, I can't complain too much. Except I'm very heavily invested in Bitcoin at this point and would much prefer to see Bitcoin evolve and adapt and improve.

I like to think that maybe it won't be. Whuffie is, in my opinion, *the* ideal currency. At present it's a pie-in-the-sky, hand-wavy kind of thing, but so was the likes of Bitcoin at one point. For around two decades before it was realized, Bitcoin was the pipe dream of cypherpunks. So I hold out hope for Whuffie to become a real thing someday. It would solve a lot of the problems with inequality, since anyone who abuses their power-expressed-as-wealth would immediately see that power taken away until such time as they prove themself worthy of it again.
There's also this awesome concept of a post-scarcity world that's gaining traction, and I think that's a good thing too. It makes me a little nervous, of course, because it reeks a little of the old "better living through technology" line which has so far arguably only worsened disparity. There's a switch in our thinking about property, particularly intellectual property, that needs to happen before we can start automating away the need for work and seeing the benefits accrue to everyone instead of just a privileged few.
But once that happens, *if* that happens, and we enter a truly post-scarcity world, I think we'll see a lot of the meaningful disparity disappear. Sure, there'll still be the famous and the infamous, and those invited to fancy parties and those who aren't. But at the very least I'd like to think money can become completely unnecessary for living a reasonably comfortable, healthy life in the developed world. And I think that's a dream that's realizable via developing self-owned, self-maintaining robotic servants. There'll *always* be an underclass, but I don't think it necessarily has to be a sentient one.

I don't have high hopes for La Zooz due to their completely unnecessary and likely ill-fated attempt to secure the network by "mining" via self-reported GPS coordinates. Quicksilver looks promising, except their software isn't open source and their white paper is uninformative.

Upboating this because yes, right now speculation is driving the price rise, not deflation. We are not yet in Bitcoin's deflationary period. There's still about 700 million bits to be deployed. The supply is being inflated to the tune of ~360,000 million bits per day.

Yeah. The page assumes you know a little bit about Bitcoin's implementation details and have a means of accessing the EC keys underlying your Bitcoin addresses. Most wallets give zero insight into that. But there isn't really a way to do multi-sig without access to those keys, either.
@_date: 2014-06-27 00:55:07
A valid EC private key is technically just any number, though you ideally want something that's at least a couple hundred bits long. A valid *Bitcoin* key can be generated from the bash script referenced in the `README` file in the repo. All this utility does is get you a truly random EC private key expressed as a hexadecimal string. From that hexadecimal string you can then generate your Bitcoin key and address. Getting a truly random EC private key to start with is the critical part of generating a Bitcoin address, since all the other steps are completely deterministic. If your EC private key was not actually randomly generated, then that lowers the effort required to guess it.

Pools are required because there's too much competition for blocks for people with only one or two miners to ever have a reasonable chance of mining one themselves. By pooling resources, miners can guarantee themselves a more consistent, albeit smaller, payout, allowing them to pay their electric bill and giving them a better chance of making enough to offset the sunk cost of their miner. It's a survival strategy.
There's no way to disincentivize pools. However, p2pool allows for decentralized pooled mining. If everyone just started using that to mine, centralized pools would not be a problem. But I guess if they were smart enough to use that, they probably would be buying bitcoin instead of throwing away their money trying to mine it. (Ideologically motivated actors aside.)

But... how do they get that backup? If it uses a different channel than the one through which they receive their own key, then that does add *some* security.

Anything involving moving or storing large sums of money, basically. You can't really justify using Bitcoin to send large sums of money if you have to buy in over a period of days just to avoid slippage. Of course, it's a moot point if both parties are already in Bitcoin and want to stay in Bitcoin. But *that's* not going to happen with large sums of money until the price stabilizes, and we're not going to get price stability until our market cap grows big enough to be more resistant to large players painting the charts and moderate-sized economic events moving the market.

That last one probably won't appeal to most people, of course. But it might appeal to some.

I'd have to agree with you *only* because I don't think there are many people who *never* generate keys on unsafe machines. I myself keep a small amount in Mycelium and an even smaller amount in Coinbase for convenience, both of which generated the keys they use. If it's an amount you could accidentally drop on the street somewhere without doing too much financial harm to yourself, the risk just isn't worth the work.
That said, if you meant "...who go through the trouble of *ever* creating keys on airgapped  machines..." I'd have to disagree. All you need to create keys on an airgapped machine is a Linux live CD or USB. Anyone who's ever booted into an OS from a USB or CD^1 has the skill necessary to do that. I've done it myself to secure any non-trivial quantities of bitcoin I plan on holding onto for more than a year, and I know a lot of other people that operate the same way.
If you're planning on ever holding more than a couple hundred dollars worth of bitcoin, I feel it's well worth the peace of mind to secure it well.
**Edit**: You could also just buy a [Piper]( or a [Mycelium Entropy]( Just be careful what printer you use with the Entropy, since a public printer could have malware loaded onto it.
^1 Given the existence of BadUSB and the mutability of USB media, CDs are a better choice for doing this sort of thing securely.

The domain isn't the real problem, it's the centralization of the web app itself. Maidsafe and Ethereum are both working on that problem.
If you're looking for something already well known and user-friendly, you're basically SOL. Best you can do is client-side key encryption/decryption and multisignature transaction signing. But that still requires trust in the website operator to not serve up code that sends your key back to them in the clear once it's decrypted, or that signs transactions you don't want signed. The client/server browser-based security model is *fundamentally* broken in this way.

Yeah, but this has a greater chance of registering as someone actually buying something with Bitcoin, and not just as someone cashing out.

Lots of conjecture there, but it seems possible to me. So I use Gyft instead of cashing out on Coinbase. More concretely, Gyft gives me 3% back, and it's faster than selling on Coinbase and waiting for the funds.

I err a bit on the paranoid side, but I don't think it's a bad thing in this particular case.

Dirt and dust gets into them sometimes and prevents the cartridge pins from making clean contact. Clear it away and the cartridge starts working fine again.

The personal information required by the exchanges and ATMs are due to regulatory laws and could go away without changing the nature of Bitcoin itself at all. And if you buy a small amount face to face with someone, you can generally do so without having to give away any personal data. Inconvenient? Sure. But it's one way of escaping the risks of turning over your personal data to yet another company.
As far as banks misusing credit cards go, it doesn't have to be the bank misusing the credit cards. Target's recent hack is a great example, IMO. Any time you have a central point of failure, you have to assume that one day it *will* fail, and you have to plan for that failure. And yeah, that includes centralized Bitcoin services. Bitcoin itself is at present the only part of the Bitcoin ecosystem I give my full trust to.

Here's a bash script that takes a chunk of hexadecimal data and turns it into an importable Bitcoin private key and address: 
Basically it derives the public key corresponding to your secp256k1 private key, and then runs a few additional hash functions on the pair and adds in a checksum to help catch transcription errors.
Every number between 1 and 115,792,089,237,316,195,423,570,985,008,687,907,852,837,564,279,074,904,382,605,163,141,518,161,494,337 is a valid secp256k1 key. As long as the hash of your file falls between those two numbers, you can use it as the secp256k1 private key for a Bitcoin address and private key pair. *Any* source of data can be used. So... that picture of your cat? Bitcoin address. Your DNA sequence from 23andMe? Bitcoin address. How safe those addresses are, of course, is a function of how likely it is that someone somewhere will one day themself use the same data to derive a Bitcoin address and private key and discover the bitcoin sitting there. But literally *anything* can be a Bitcoin address, as long as it's consistently reducible to a number between 1 and.... that really long number previously mentioned.
Is pretty cool, IMO. :-3

Only do it if you can afford it, of course! Bitcoin is still very volatile, though less than it used to be. Lots of people overextended themselves last year and found themselves up shit creek. I don't imagine a million bits will break the bank for you, but I feel something of a moral obligation to at least say this: never invest more than you can afford to lose.

That's correct. However, you should be okay as long as you don't generate a string of longer than 256 bits. Technically the largest number than can be turned into a Bitcoin address (according to [the wiki]( is, in hexadecimal, FFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFEBAAEDCE6AF48A03BBFD25E8CD0364141.

You know, offering a compliant interface to the fiat world in a state where the startups haven't yet gotten their legal ducks in a row (but are planning to soon begin attempting to) could be a pretty good business plan. We could cover a lot more states if we coordinated, and lowering the barrier to entry for a particular state seems like a profitable way to achieve that end. It'd save the startups a bunch of cash if they shared the same legal umbrella, thus letting them expand out to new states sooner, *and* it'd probably make a ton of cash for whoever sets the whole thing up.

For storage over several years, I'd recommend a titanium card with an offline-generated address and a BIP38 private key printed or etched on it. I recently got one from  and I'm pretty happy with it. You can achieve a good degree of security during the address generation process by downloading the [bitaddress.org browser-based generator]( and opening it under a copy of Linux running live off a USB stick on an air gapped, offline machine. For me, that's an acceptable tradeoff between hassle and security for addresses that I plan on keeping bitcoin in for longer than a year. I've also played with [generating addresses using dice]( but even I accept that this is more paranoid than is probably necessary. :-)
For spending bitcoin, I keep some in Mycelium on my Android phone and some in a password-protected Multibit wallet on my laptop.

I don't think you understand the psychology backing up this argument. We are averse to owning "only part" of something. We want to own whole units. *That's* the primary issue. We never decide to go for 7/8 mile jogs. That just feels weird, doesn't it? We want a 1 mile jog.
Even worse, we're not used to dealing with *coins* that are *divisible up to eight decimal places.* When people hear about Bitcoin in passing, they're going to make the assumption that 1 bitcoin is the smallest unit obtainable, and they're going to tune out because they're too expensive for them to own a "whole" one. Case in point:  at a little after the 1:47:00 mark.

The point you were making was that Bitcoin cannot produce a product of any kind and thus the value of bitcoin cannot rise with the increased utility of Bitcoin via new features and/or market offerings. Those were, after all, the criteria you appeared to be laying out for what constitutes a company and its stock.

Because it's against the terms of service for merchants to offer different prices for credit card payments and cash payments. Gas stations are apparently exempt from that clause, though, for whatever reason. (The TOS hasn't stopped some smaller merchants, of course.

The problem with this reasoning is that you're doing it in the logical equivalent of a frictionless vacuum. Information is never perfectly distributed, and the superiority of a product alone is not enough to guarantee that the product dominates the market. Aside from the problems posed by the imperfect distribution of information within markets, there's also a psychological cost to switching from a system one already knows and is comfortable with to an unfamiliar one. The perceived advantages must be *significant* in order to overcome psychological inertia. For a lot of people, it's possible that this threshold will never be reached. Furthermore, it's not been demonstrated yet that a deflationary, decentralized currency like Bitcoin can actually outcompete an inflationary, centralized one like the US dollar. The closest analogy we have is gold, and it's pretty obviously lost in terms of seeing widespread use as a currency. There are a lot of one-off, black swan events that can muddy up what *should* happen based on "clean room" reasoning and create an entirely different outcome. "Hyperbitcoinization" makes a lot of sense in the abstract, but whether it'll translate well to the "real" world is another question entirely.

That said, I do also view places that have *only* positive reviews with suspicion. There's always *someone* with an axe to grind. If nobody seems to have anything negative to say about the place, or if I notice all the reviews are from around the same time, I suspect fake reviews.

I dunno. My approach isn't even very similar to theirs, to be honest. I don't include a checksum in the phrase generated, for example. As for key length, it seems strange that key length alone would be protecting them from violating a patent. I'd have to see the patent to really make a judgement.
And if there really *is* a patent that dictates they use 128 bits for their keyspace instead of 256, then that'd imply that BIP 0039 at the very least encourages violation of that patent, if it doesn't outright violate it itself.
@_date: 2014-06-26 23:36:48
Yeah, that's fair. You could technically use any kind of die and do okay. There's a "dice-wallet" project that recommends rolling a six-sided die 99 times and running the results through a SHA-256 utility, for example. But if you want something that you can translate directly to binary, you'll need it to generate a number between 1 and some power of 2. Which is exactly what extra-paranoid people like me who don't want to have to trust the pseudo-randomness of SHA-256 might do.
Consequently, I took the opportunity today to brush off my C skills and write a command line utility that takes a series of numbers from, say, a coin or an 8-sided die and turns it into a hexadecimal string. It's [over on my Github](

Okay, I see you've got plans. But I really don't see anything unique or special about this project. I don't see any reason to believe that your project will succeed where others have failed. All you're doing is setting up yet another organization to Do Things^TM and pay people for doing those things using a cryptocurrency that you premined. You're not going to create a fair and equitable status quo that changes the world that way. At best, you'll end up distributing your coins and then fading away as the organization you've created itself decentralizes. At worst you'll create a centralized organization that mirrors the system already in place. You're doing absolutely nothing to address the root causes of the problems you say you want to solve.

I agree that Bitcoin will be opposed by some states, and I agree that using Bitcoin may be an act of civil disobedience many may be forced into. I disagree that unfettered markets are the solution, but I also disagree that any state we have so far seen can be considered a solution either. I'm still working out my political/philosophical framework, and the only things I've decided on so far is that power disparities ought to be minimized and workers should own the means of production directly, with the only exception possibly being modest "rent to own" arrangements between people with means and those without. If I am using it to produce value, I should either own it or be put on a reasonable path toward owning it by virtue of my use of it. (This system would primarily be in the interests of minimizing power disparities and encouraging good stewardship of value producing possessions.)
If Bitcoin can outcompete what exists, nobody will have to convince anyone else to become a criminal. Criminals will use it and reap the rewards. Those who would rather not won't, and they'll be put at a disadvantage for it. And those of us who feel there's an ethical/moral dimension to using Bitcoin will disobey the laws to better serve our consciences.

It's not that Circle "can't figure out how much money [you] have," it's that Circle lets you hold Bitcoin while displaying its USD value by default. So when Circle "sent [OP] $10," they really sent 0.021 bitcoin, which was worth about $6 a month later. The money in their account didn't change at all. Its value in terms of USD did. It's a bad UX that could potentially lead to confusion, but it's hardly anything to do with Bitcoin itself, nor does it have anything to do with Circle's ability to figure out how much money is in your account.

I don't necessarily agree that altcoins are completely unnecessary for these sorts of things. Not until we figure out sidechains, anyway. Having a decentralized way of maintaining identity and trust information (such as rider and driver comments and ratings) is a pretty good argument for creating an altcoin, as is being able to use a blockchain that isn't bloated with transactions that aren't relevant to your particular application.
But yes, I totally agree regarding La Zooz.

Hash functions themselves don't change once they're "in the wild," AFAIK. New ones get released every once in a while, generally as the US military has need.
A person *could* try to dispute the particular hash used, but the problem there is that they would then have to come up with a document that creates an identical hash using a different hashing function *and* that also happens to look like a plausible, signed contract between the involved parties. Generating *any* kind of data that maps back to a pre-determined digest using a working, trusted hash function is an intractable problem. The heat death of the universe is likely to occur before then, assuming nobody finds any weaknesses in the function. Add on *top* of that the need to produce data that resembles a believable contract that has been signed by the private keys of all parties involved, and now we're talking way, way beyond the heat death of the universe. (Assuming the attacking party hasn't somehow gotten a copy of the other private keys, in which case they could just sign whatever contracts they wanted with *those* and claim the new contract supercedes the previous one.)
Now, the "compromised private key" scenario is an interesting one. It's a problem that can be somewhat mitigated by using a superkey and subkeys: basically a private key that can used to generate *other* private keys, and which can also be provably linked to the keys it generates by its corresponding public key. So you end up with a key that can revoke any of the keys it's used to generate. At that point, it's just a matter of needing to have a blockchain for the actual contract data and requiring that the contract data sit on that blockchain for a predetermined time without any of the private keys used in the signatures being revoked. (Storj or Ethereum could technically fill the role of the contract chain.)
While there may still need to be human arbitration in the event that one of the parties claims that something went wrong in their contract-blockchain-watching-and-private-key-revocation process, I don't think that would be a common case. And in any event, there would have to be extraordinary, eminently provable circumstances involved in order for the blockchain proof to ever be circumvented.
But if your superkey is ever compromised, well... you're basically SOL. You'll have to revoke the superkey before the attacker does too much damage. The identity connected to that key and all its subkeys will probably have to be assumed dead and you'll have to then work on building up a new identity. It'd be like if your social security number were compromised, except it's a lot harder to compromise a private key, especially if you keep it encrypted. If you'd previously used the superkey and its subkeys to encode other identifying information, such as biometric data, you could probably use *that* to prove to other sentient actors that the compromised keys do in fact belong to you. This would allow you some ad hoc carryover of your previous identity's reputation and agreements.
Sorry, I guess I rambled a little there. It's *really* interesting stuff to think about though. I'd love to be a part of building those kinds of services someday, but I think it's beyond most people at the moment. :-/

Aside from not having to maintain the code and the miners themselves, not as far as I can tell. And at that point, they might as well just keep records in a database and eschew the decentralized approach entirely. Which is why I'm skeptical of this article's conjecture.

This is indeed a seminal piece for those who were at Bitcoin's beginning. I've seen it pop up a lot, and it's absolutely true, despite the intense cyberpunk flavor. Information frees itself. Or, as it's commonly put, "information *wants* to be free." The thing that makes information so slippery is the vast number of forms it can take. Encryption allows for a seemingly-random sequence of *anything* to stand for information of one kind or another. You could do it with napkins in a restaurant or cards in a deck if you liked. There's no need to constrain information to a computer.
*Information is everywhere.* We ourselves are no more than information turned back on itself, as are all living beings. It's in our DNA. In the leaves on a tree. In the configuration of the rocks in a desert. And it's this fact which enables our "Information Age."
Edit: Forgive me if I seem to wax mystical toward the end. I recently finished *Godel, Escher, Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid*, and it's left me preoccupied with self-reference and with the ubiquity and encoding of information.

Yeah. You would have to "existify" the copy of the contract *both* of you signed. (gives a good overview of that in their response to your comment.) If both of you lose the copy, then you are indeed SOL. Not really any different from how it works in meatspace though, AFAIK. If you try to enforce a contract that has no existing copies, you're generally SOL there too.

Believe me, I get that. I'm not sure Ethereum will succeed in making a *safe* Turing-complete language. Using ether to effectively "solve" the halting problem will probably work, IMO, but there's no guarantee. It's a very hard problem. But I think that this is a feasible point in time to tackle it, since the blockchain solution has now been demonstrably proven in the wild for a few years now. If Ethereum succeeds in its goals, it'll be nothing short of revolutionary. It'll be something greater than Bitcoin by a long shot, IMO.

The problem is more the objectification and the general approval thereof which this post making the first page implies, IMO. The "booth babe" phenomenon in general tends to make tech spaces very unwelcoming to women. It has the unfortunate effect of reinforcing certain negative messages about (and sent towards) women: that they are to be seen, not heard. That their primary function is as eye candy, and not as serious, equal participants.
EDIT: Also, seeing a booth babe used in connection with a brand tends to lower my estimation of that brand. I realize I may be unusual in this respect, but to me reeks of anti-intellectual demagoguery. I can't take a brand seriously if they don't seem to realize how problematic their behavior is. And since I don't generally *like* the crowd that has no qualms with booth babes, it discourages *my* participation in those spaces as well.

This is a great point. There's a barrier to entry, a minimum level of affluence, that has to be reached in order to take advantage of Bitcoin at this point in time.

Verified, and the signature checks out. For those of you who don't know how to use GPG (and who have the good sense to be wary of random Internet strangers), here's how to verify the signature for yourself on a *nix system:
1. Download [Gavin's public key](
2. Open a terminal and type:
    gpg --import ~/Downloads/gavinandresen.asc
3. The output of the command above should state that, at minimum, key 1FC730C1 was imported. (This was the key used to sign the Red Bridge message.)
4. Download [the raw text of Gavin's clearsigned message](
5. In your terminal, type:
    gpg --decrypt ~/Downloads/RedBridgeVerify.txt
6. Verify that the above command's output starts with:
    gpg: Signature made Wed 09 Apr 2014 08:51:11 AM PDT using RSA key ID 1FC730C1
    gpg: Good signature from "Gavin Andresen (CODE SIGNING KEY) &lt;gavinandresen

Coinpunk developer here. I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2011. Never once posted to SRS. You aren't being raided. I'm just calling out an instance of the casual sexism that pervades the tech and gaming scene.
And we aren't "not holding adult females to the basic standards of being human." We aren't "implying women have no agency and thus had no choice in voluntarily accepting this job." We are saying that shit like this discourages women who might otherwise have been interested in participating in this scene from participating. We are saying that *this* is one of the reasons you don't see many women in tech. The whole scene is one giant, hand-painted "No Girls Allowed" clubhouse sign.

I think the problem is, as always, the power disparity that comes with that kind of wealth. Is it wrong, in itself, for some people to have more and for others to have less? Of course not. But with such vast disparity you end up with a world that's much more responsive to the needs of a small few, which often ends up being translated into oppression for the rest. *That's* the problem with wealth inequality. It's a power disparity, and it's little different from any other power disparity.

I don't see the Bitcoin Foundation as a meaningfully centralized organization, to be honest. I see it as just another organization among the many within the Bitcoin space. I don't think they're blocking anyone else from setting up shop and trying to compete with them. I don't hear them saying anything like, "our way or the highway."
Organizing, uniting our small pockets of power behind a larger cause, is the only way we're going to have a chance to stand up to a large, powerful organization like the state without being totally steamrolled. Mastercard and Citigroup aren't about to dissolve themselves in the name of "decentralization," and they're lobbying hard.
Now there's the an-cap argument that we should just ignore the government, and that has merit. I would disobey the government too if they ordered me to do something sufficiently morally reprehensible, or so I'd like to think. But regardless of what you or I would do, there's a whole mass of humanity out there that can make life a lot harder or a lot easier for Bitcoin, and they're going to take the government's lead on this. And Citigroup and Mastercard are undoubtedly lobbying their asses off to make life as hard as possible for Bitcoin.
We can't just roll over and let Citigroup and Mastercard walk all over us. We need to unite. We need to organize. We shouldn't dissolve the Bitcoin Foundation. If you don't like the Foundation, then compete with them.

Super-interested in this answer as well. That said, it's a very hard question to answer because most people don't keep all their bitcoin at one address. However, under the (undoubtedly wrong) assumption that there is a one to one correspondence of addresses to people on the network, you only need about 60 BTC to be among [the top 20,000 richest Bitcoin users]( If we include all seven billion people on this planet in our estimation of the "Bitcoin rich," then 60 BTC would put you in the top 0.0002%, in terms of bitcoin.
But this is a terrible way to analyze the problem. Another way to analyze the problem, though still a pretty terrible one, would be to survey Bitcoin owners on Reddit about how much bitcoin they own and go off of that data. This way you're at least trying to get at how much bitcoin each *person* has, rather than how much each *address* has. But the problem there is that you're just getting a sample of the subset of Bitcoin users who frequent and you're trusting the survey-takers to be honest.
As luck would have it, somebody has already approached the problem this way. Business Insider published [an article about it]( back in February. Looking at [the Reddit thread]( it seems that just four months ago it would have taken 50 BTC to be a one-percenter in Bitcoin. But again, this is from data gathered with a methodology I personally find rather suspect.

I'm saying you can argue against all those decisions without having to fall back to anything as inane as "but you're too young for that." It's a decent heuristic, and it's a very efficient way to end all discussion on a matter, but it's also entirely possible to go a level down and argue based on *why* getting pregnant or adopting a child is generally a bad decision for a kid.
My own concern was that this kid thought their age was a relevant factor in *this* particular decision, which made me suspect that maybe their sensitivity to that particular heuristic is a tad high. If a person is interested in learning about finance and trying their hand at investing, they shouldn't let their age stop them from pursuing that interest.

Actually, I did think of that while I was writing this. My problem with it was that with a number in a base that isn't a power of 2, not every bit has an equal chance of getting flipped. For example, with a six-sided die, we'd have these encodings, subtracting 1 from each roll to allow a "roll" of 0:
- 0 = 000
- 1 = 001
- 2 = 010
- 3 = 011
- 4 = 100
- 5 = 101
So the first bit has a 1/3 chance of getting flipped, the middle bit has a 1/3 chance of getting flipped, but the last bit has a 1/2 chance of getting flipped. This produces an uneven distribution and causes the key to deviate from true random. We'd have to devise a scheme to ensure each bit has an even chance of getting flipped, and I can't say I managed to come up with one while I was writing this utility.
**Edit:** Oh man, thanks for posting that question. It got me thinking again, and I realized that simply discarding any bits that have a non-even chance of being flipped is a *totally* valid way of addressing this issue. That way a person could totally use a six-sided die, but it would act like a four-sided die in terms of bits provided. It's so simple. So much derp. ;__;

I never called it horrific and horrible. I said it was creating an environment that discourages women from participating. The women accepting those jobs may not give a toss what happens to this scene. I do. That's why I'm calling this out.


*These* women may not care about being taken as serious equal participants in this particular space. *These* women may be more interested in putting food on the table. *Other* women may find it encourages certain stereotypes and prejudices which hinder their participation in this space, however. They are not the ones accepting the jobs, but they still suffer the negative consequences.


Yeah, that's probably why women are more likely to be hired and make so much more than men. That unfair physical advantage.
Oh wait... (I really hope I don't have to spell this one out for you.)


If this is how a brand caters to its people, I am obviously not among its people. And thank you for highlighting one of the reasons I don't trust the free market enough to be a libertarian. Yes, sex sells, and yes, a business can profit from perpetuating stereotypes.

Just because a thing is profitable does not mean it is right or good.

You're always going to have bugs and security holes. That's just inevitable. The question is really whether the developers are working *against* the users of their software or not. With closed source software you have a dynamic where a central point can be easily coerced or bribed by powerful actors, such as large content rentiers and state agencies, to include security holes that they find beneficial.


I do wonder if open source does get more eyeballs sometimes. I can't speak to it at all because I've never dug into that question, but my gut instinct is that any code that has a budget behind it is going to get more screen-time than any code that doesn't, open source or not, popular or not. Could be wrong on that, of course.
I do agree that open source has other advantages going for it. I'm at the point where I actually think it's unethical to produce closed source software, in fact, because in doing so you are producing something that only exacerbates the power imbalances already present in the world today. You're contributing the banks of software and ignoring the Bitcoins of software. You're contributing to centralization at the expense of decentralization.
But again, your mileage may vary, and I expect there are going to be a lot of people here who don't feel quite as strongly about it as I do. The fact that many here likely rely on a paycheck that comes from producing closed source software probably won't help either. It can be hard to turn against a paradigm when you feel that it's your compliance with that paradigm which keeps you from starving.

Who are you donating it to? What are they doing with it? What's their attitude around patenting their discoveries versus sharing them? I don't have any data on the overall state of the field. Maybe the usual choice is to share everything and patent nothing. Knowing companies in general, I doubt they're passing up the opportunity to make a bunch of money, but maybe they are. Regardless of whether they are, though, that's not the default for "intellectual property." It's a conscious decision that organizations have to make and then stand by. Even non-profits can hold patents in the United States, where I live.

Legality doesn't figure in, IMO. Legality only determines how widespread and open a practice becomes. The price of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies are obviously being manipulated as well, and will continue to be manipulated no matter what. Right now this manipulation takes place barely under the surface of things. It's not difficult to pick out individual players, if you set your mind to it. But if the law starts cracking down on it, a few players will get caught, and the remaining players will push their activities deeper underground and enjoy the fruits of less competition. You've got to participate in the market with this manipulation in mind, no matter what the regulatory climate may be. The free market is an oligarchy, and I think it will *always* be an oligarchy.

Beyond that, I think we need to design systems that can also withstand irrational actors as much as possible too. Because some would say it's not in GHash's own best interests to erode confidence in the network like this, but that is hardly a universal opinion and it makes a few potentially erroneous assumptions about where their profit is coming from. Whether there's another party with something to gain from this subsidizing GHash's actions or not, though, there's still plenty of wiggle room around what even constitutes rational, self-interested action. Maybe GHash knows they can't or probably won't reap enough long-term benefits to behave themselves. Then their erosion of the network would still be rational and self-interested. And if we start considering their possible motivations as "irrational" actors, then the motivational floodgates *really* open.
We need a way to effectively address the mining centralization problem. PoS isn't a solution, because it trades one kind of centralization for another. If we could disincentivize the use of centralized pools somehow without destroying the benefits they accrue to small miners, that'd certainly be a step in the right direction. The system has to decide what "rational self-interest" looks like in as strong of terms possible.

There *are* people trying to create decentralized communist systems, so it's possible that centralization doesn't necessarily follow. I haven't engaged with the subject enough to have my own opinions yet on the feasibility of such schemes, but it's interesting to note that most visions of the "post-scarcity economy" we're slowly (hopefully) getting ourselves into satisfy both capitalist and communist visions of what the world should be like. (At least from what I've seen so far.)

The problem is that in a capitalist society the incumbents are also free to exercise violence, or the threat thereof, to prevent meaningful competition from forming. (The idea of "crony capitalism" as separate from "free market capitalism" is, in my opinion, a cop out. The latter becomes the former, unless there is some sort of hitherto unrealized mediating force preventing it.) Free markets tend toward monopolies due to the fungibility and the self-perpetuating nature of power. Money buys violence buys money buys whatever other form of power one wants. And on top of this, there's also the matter of network effects and less violent anti-competitive practices. I think you paint too rosy a picture of capitalism and markets.
As for your second point, I'm honestly undecided on the matter simply because I don't know if we can meaningfully talk about "free choice" in a system which dictates people make certain choices or else starve. In principle no, I don't have a problem with it. But I question whether the question itself is relevant to the situation at hand. I suspect we won't really be able to talk about it where work is concerned until we've at least entered a post-scarcity economy where the impetus of survival has been removed from decisions regarding work.
That said, I do personally prefer that changes arise from decentralized, bottom-up, voluntary structures rather than centralized, coercive ones. I find the latter unethical. So creating a structure where workers are given full ownership of their work and the fruits thereof that then itself spreads mores and memes that encourage the reproduction of structures like itself would be ideal. One of my big problems with the way the world presently works is the imbalance engendered by contracts and agreements that prevent workers from ever coming to own all the components necessary to make unilateral decisions about their labor and capture the entirety of their labor's value. My ideal structure looks like a collection of independent freelancers all contracting with each other as equals, not a non-compete agreement in sight, with social mores and worker's unions (or something like worker's unions) both preventing the formation and spread of agreements under which workers cannot reasonably hope to attain to ownership of the tools and relationships they need in order to produce value. (Apologies for the run-on sentence.)
Even more ideally there would be some sort of automatic, self-maintaining, and self-owned system to maintain records of ownership based on use. Something to prevent foreign corporations from exploiting resources they have no ethical right to, whatever money might have changed hands. (Thinking in particular of transnational businesses appropriating things in the "commons," such as water and land, things presently claimed by the businesses we call governments, when those things had already been claimed and used for centuries prior by native peoples without enough power of their own to defend themselves from such depredations.) In theory, associations of contractors like the one previously described could help mitigate this problem by returning a sense of personal agency and responsibility to workers, but I think the system described in this paragraph would probably be more effective than that if it could someday be pulled off.

The problem here is that asymmetry of privacy results in a power imbalance in favor of the one who is able to maintain their privacy. As this is the case, there will always be incentive to maintain whatever secrecy one can. Thus society will not be able to be completely transparent until privacy is literally, fundamentally impossible. On top of this, I think it's actually *right* for citizens to demand at least as much privacy as (if not more than) the organizations that run the world they live in. After all, the erosion of their privacy amounts to an exacerbation of the power imbalance enjoyed by those organizations by virtue of their "monopoly on the legitimate use of force." The greater that power imbalance becomes, the greater the abuse that will result.

Depends on how it's done. Most places these days use credit card processors that handle the actual card details and charging, passing a temporary "transaction token" back to the merchant which can be used to check up on the status of the transaction until it either goes through or is rejected. Sometimes the flow is a little different, but the idea remains the same: instead of your credit card details being spread out across vendors, they end up in the hands of just a few credit card processing companies that specialize in securing credit card details.
That said, there *are* places that try to handle credit cards themselves and end up losing their customers' details in various security breaches. And the processing companies are not themselves invulnerable either.

Strangely enough, I find sexual power play between consenting adults to be much less fucked up than the double standards and rape-y undertones present in the mainstream "romance" narratives. But I find I am (necessarily) in the minority in this assessment.
Edit: Though I do understand your initial reaction being what it is. I had a similar one when I first stumbled upon male chastity. But digging deeper into it, I found that a lot of the narratives in that scene are written by and for *men* who find that sort of talk arousing. And as with any sort of power exchange, the primary thing to keep in mind is that it is, first and foremost, *play*. It is not to be pushed on anyone who isn't explicitly interested in that sort of play, and it is not to be taken seriously outside of the clearly defined, pre-negotiated (and continually re-negotiated) boundaries delineating "play space" from "the real world." (Though how much of "the real world" that play space annexes is, of course, up to the players.)

You'd need some form of centralization, of course, since we can't mathematically discern between legitimate claims and fake ones, but there's no reason that the basic function of an insurance company couldn't be handled outside the traditional system.

Rather than issue regulations, why not create a company that enforces these regulations in exchange for providing a seal of compliance? Then if the regulations are successful, the seal will be worthwhile and participating companies will see increased revenue from customers interested in the extra protection afforded by the regulation. If the regulations are not successful, the seal of compliance will be worthless. This will allow for alternative regulatory bodies and help the market find a set of rules that works. It will also keep innovative startups in New York. The proposed regulation as it stands seems to be rather onerous, given the reception its been getting.

Okay, so there was the blockchain fork due to a change in the reference client (solved within a couple hours) and then there was the reference client bug way back in Satoshi's day that (IIRC) let you spend other people's bitcoin.

Fair enough. It sounds like Bitcoin isn't for you right now, then. Here in the States, we don't have a PIN &amp; chip system yet, so it's pretty easy to steal and use credit cards. Bankers over here are too busy fraudulently foreclosing on homeowners and laundering money for violent gangs to keep up with the rest of the world, apparently. (BTW, if you're part of that, please [kill yourself](  And in other places in the world, the infrastructure is even worse.
Past that, I think most of the early uses for it may be in industry, and for things besides simple transfer of currency. Micropayment channels also look pretty awesome.
**Edit:** I do believe that we'll see more discounts as companies continue to roll out Bitcoin support. What will likely end up happening is the savings from the lower cost of Bitcoin transactions (as compared to credit cards) will get split between the merchant and the consumer. This is a phenomenon that should continue across merchants, so your complaint about "true discounts" should be appeased once the merchants you prefer get on board.

Fair enough. Picking out a particular case and saying, "this was caused by Operation Chokepoint" is difficult to do. Operation Chokepoint may not have caused Tegan's or Stoya's accounts to be closed. The far more interesting thing to me is that Operation Chokepoint exists. This is the first I'd heard of the DOJ going after legal businesses by forcing banks to close down their accounts. It doesn't particularly matter to me whether or not those legal businesses include Tegan and Stoya's businesses.

As someone who's been in Bitcoin since 2011, I've always known this would be a problem. But the last time I brought it up (in 2011, IIRC) nobody took me seriously. There were too many liber-tards in the community and all they had to say was "monopolies are a product of the state" and "the free market will find a solution." I do hope that the free market will find a solution here, because that's our only option. But one of the *natural consequences* of a free market is the consolidation of power into *monopolies.* Given enough time, that's the end state of a free market.
Maybe we can find a way to circumvent that. Maybe not. I like to think we *can* find a solution. The bigger question for me is whether we, as a community, will be prepared to implement that solution if one is ever found. If we have a bunch of dumbasses and hucksters telling people to bury their heads in the sand, I think that really hurts our chances.
We need smart people talking and thinking honestly about these things, not a bunch of greedy asswipes trying to paper over structural problems and existential threats in order to prop up their investment's value until the next bubble.
Then again, I dunno. Maybe there's value in keeping the general populace ignorant while the people smart enough to not be duped work on solving the real problems. Maybe that'll buy the people who actually have a chance of solving these problems enough time to implement them. I don't imagine what I write here will make much difference either way, to be honest, but maybe it will.
Regardless, we need to find a solution for this. We've bought a lot of time with self-policing. But self-policing has never been a viable long-term solution. There are too many dumbasses and selfish actors in the world for any sizable community to survive through nothing more than self-policing. We need code in place. We need processes that make it hard or impossible to misbehave. Nobody should ever have to say "trust us."

Actually, the owner of Madison's was very pro-Bitcoin. What I heard happened was the business wasn't making enough money and was forced to close.

On the other side of that screen name, there's a real human being. Not every person can be won over, sure, and even fewer can be won over in just a single exchange. And not every person is even honestly looking for a real exchange. A lot of people just want to rustle jimmies. But there's still a human being on the other end. When I've managed to keep my temper in check, maintain a cool head, and engage people rationally, I've often been pleasantly surprised. Many times I do end up disappointed, but at least when you keep a cool head and treat people with respect (and respect your own time enough to disengage from apparently disingenuous exchanges), the other person usually comes out the worse for their trolling. And over time, and over many exchanges, a person *can* change their point of view.

I agree, though I do think there's a pretty solid future for peer-to-peer/federated services, at least where sensitive data is concerned. Not sure what you mean by "lossy," to be honest, especially since you cite BitTorrent's "massive fault tolerance" later on. "Inherently non-private" doesn't make any sense to me given the existence of I2P, GNUnet, Tor, and the like. You are right, though: centralized architectures generally *are* faster and more efficient.
As for your point about user files versus files that everyone has an interest in,  the incentive structure of the likes of Storj may solve that problem. In fact, I suspect it may also solve a large chunk of the speed problem since there should be a *lot* more seeders on that network. There's also the passive storage/seeding that NightWeb relied on, where any friend who views your profile then becomes a seeder for that profile. The lack of features and crappy UI aside, that project seemed to work pretty well. I imagine it might've turned into something greater if it'd gained developer traction.

I do admit a lot of my interest in Bitcoin, aside from the blockchain's utility, is emotional. I haven't forgiven the banks for everything surrounding 2008, and I don't believe they've changed any. They continue to act like arrogant, entitled parasites. I honestly believe the world would be better off without most of them, and I want to do whatever I can within the realm of non-violent action to undermine their power.

If you can swing it, I'd even recommend [Trisquel]( [gNewSense]( or [any of the other distros on GNU's list]( Debian's pretty good, but it does recommend the installation of non-~~free~~libre software at times. Depending on what balance of stringency versus flexibility/ease-of-use one wants, those distros could serve better.
For example, if one's just setting up an offline machine for nothing but signing transactions and doing other cryptographic work, and if one of the GNU-endorsed distros supports all the hardware you need, then I'd go with that. Debian's a shade closer to the ease-of-use end of the spectrum, Ubuntu a shade further, and Linux Mint is as far over as possible, AFAIK. But ease-of-use and security are, in this case, opposed due to the insistence of certain hardware manufacturers on not releasing the source code for their hardware's firmware and drivers. So you've got to make more compromises between security and user-friendliness for the time being than you would otherwise.
@_date: 2014-07-26 21:44:56
Not exactly. What's actually being solved here is a *modified* version of the halting problem involving finite-sized programs. Any program running on the Ethereum network will have to have enough ether to pay for its own execution. This puts a functional limit on the number of operations a script may execute without additional input from other actors. The only case where a program does *not* ever halt is one where the program is taking in enough ether to pay for its own execution. And in that case, it could be argued that it must be providing some sort of valuable service to the actors on the network and is thus not simply an infinite, no-op loop of some kind.
So really, Ethereum doesn't solve the halting problem. It just kinda neatly steps around it.

I was reacting to that. It sounded like you were saying there wasn't a problem with wealth inequality.
And yes, inequality is indeed a fact of life. Nobody's saying we can do away with it. I do think that it'd be good if we could take steps to reduce wealth inequality, but I also think that's outside of Bitcoin's scope. I value Bitcoin as an intermediate step, as something that solves a lot of problems and decentralizes a lot of power currently held by a handful of centralized institutions. I am excited about it. But I don't think it's money's ultimate form. And I do see it creating some problems, some of which will be very similar to the ones it solves. Mining centralization is one, and worsening the wealth disparity is another. I'd be very happy if those two issues worked themselves out, but I wouldn't count on it.
@_date: 2014-06-07 21:40:06
Thanks for the tip!
Ghash is just easier to get set up with, and people are usually drawn most to the biggest actor in any given space. People tend to assume that biggest == best. Ghash also sells mining contracts via Cex, as I understand it. So if I'm a noob looking to get in on this mining thing with minimal fuss, I'll probably "rent" equipment via Cex. If I ever decide to get my own equipment, I'll probably be inclined to keep mining on Ghash.

There's a difference between being offered, for free, a thing of greater value or a thing of lesser value, and deciding which to buy of two things that are of equal value.  (Of course, I'm assuming one of those is worth more than the other. I don't watch Dogecoim at all.)
And at any rate, I can't say what they'd do in that situation. I can yell you that they "thought about buying Bitcoin, but decided not to because [they] couldn't afford a whole one, so [they] got some Doge instead."

What *I* really want to see is a super-lean production chain enabled with Bitcoin. Have every purchase at PoS automatically get distributed to every person who needs to get paid for the sold item. And then have that act as a signal to each entity in the production chain to produce one more widget to replace the one that was just sold. Ideally this would be done directly on the blockchain using the Bitcoin scripting language without the interference of any third party. Not sure if that's something that can be done with it as-is, though. I *think* it can be, but I haven't done a close study of the scripting language yet.

Then, as with many things in Bitcoin, it's a failure of users to demand these things from the services they've used that has gotten us to this point.

Some of those producing "how Bitcoin works" videos would do well to expand their businesses in those directions, IMO.

That's only true of a world where massive amounts of labor are required to keep things going. We don't actually need the amount of labor we're currently using. We're paying people to build Abrams tanks that'll just end up rusting away in storage because we're so married to this idea that jobs (as they are commonly understood) are necessary. We're paying people to take orders at fast food places when machines could do just as well, if not better.
The fact is that technology is slowly making labor obsolete. That's the whole point of technology. We build technology to make the world better, sure, but primarily we build technology so that one day the cost of survival is so low that effectively nobody has to pay for it.

Given that most bank branches limit the amount of cash they have on hand at any given time, and given that there are more than a few bitcoin-rich users out there, I'd believe it. But I've had a couple experiences in this space that've made me a bit more credulous about things like that. For example, I was at a Bitcoin meetup where a guy was selling a few hundred bitcoin. He walked out with a grocery bag of cash that night, and I found out a few days later that he'd sold about $50k there. Our meetup group was probably about 20 to 30 people that night, and we just happened to have brought at least $50k in cash, collectively. Blew my mind a bit.

Maybe. I'd say microbitcoins at least, because if we get to the point where we need to switch from millibitcoins, we'll be too big to make the change, IMO. And the thing is, unit bias only cuts one way. People have no aversion to having a few million of something. People *do* have an aversion to having one-tenth of something. And a bunch of zeroes to the right of a number are a lot easier to deal with than a bunch of zeroes to the left of it.
Satoshi gets my vote because it *doesn't* sound like you only own *part* of something, like "microbitcoin" does. Look at Dogecoin and how well its been doing. Do you know how many people have told me that they chose to buy Dogecoin over Bitcoin because they could only afford "a fraction of one Bitcoin" while they could afford "a few hundred Dogecoin." It's not logical, it's not rational, but it's *how humans work.* And as obnoxious as that is sometimes, that's what you have got to work with.

This is one of the real threats I see to Bitcoin. There was an article posted a couple days ago that was mostly panned by the folks here, but it was about this threat. The mining market seems to tend toward a natural monopoly due to the economies of scale involved. And yeah, you can make the argument that even a mining monopoly wouldn't abuse their power because they have so much invested in Bitcoin and it would undermine that foundation. But you're assuming that they don't ever see the need to exit the market, and you're assuming that the monopoly is a rational, monolithic entity. A company's made up of a lot of different people, and a rational actor *within* the company *could* potentially see a lot of personal gain by fucking over the rest of us. Having any one entity that controls over 50% of the network exposes us to real, non-trivial risk.
And I mean, sure, there are a limited number of things a bad actor can do during a 51% attack, but the ability of the network to maintain its own integrity is a *big* selling point for Bitcoin. Aberrations, no matter how small, seriously undermine that aspect of Bitcoin's utility.
Speaking of selling points, isn't decentralization another big one? The vision of distributing power more evenly? Of wresting control of our money system from a handful of oligarchs and putting it into the hands of a predictable, distributed algorithm? So where does that leave Bitcoin if it too ends up in the hands of a few oligarchs? If it becomes hopelessly centralized?
I really like Bitcoin, but I will lose all interest if mining does indeed end up centralized.

That's fair. Though I have to say I don't get the sense that he cares more about money than about p2pool. Putting in a bunch of unpaid work and running tech support for people actively opting out of author donations can be *really* demoralizing.
And at any rate, I think he can turn this thing into a viable business if he puts his mind to it. First thing I'd personally do is require donations from people who want 1-on-1 support. That should cut down on the unpaid time spent on the project. Might be worthwhile contacting some of the larger mining farms to see what they'd like to see in upcoming versions and if they'd be willing to sponsor part of the development. Could also see about offering emergency support packages to the people running the farms. You've got a few petahashes on p2pool? I imagine you'd be willing to spend a couple hundred bucks a month to have forrestv a phone call away.

All I can say is that there *does* exist a point where I'd feel there was no coming back from a mining monopoly and where I'd end up exiting. This is probably driven by the fact that *this* is the one threat I've been anxious about ever since I joined back in 2011. The economics of mining may prove antithetical to a wide distribution of mining power.

Yeah, the music industry survived MP3s, and the financial industry will probably survive Bitcoin. But the *players* in the music industry saw a lot of action. Huge power centers declined, and new ones rose. That's what I'm talking about. There are a lot of established players riding cash cows that (rightly, I think) see Bitcoin as a threat to their comfortable, low-competition lifestyles. And yeah, you're right, it *could* totally destroy a lot of power centers, but it probably won't. But you'd be crazy to think that anyone with power who sees something that *could* destroy their power will just sit back and hope things shake out in their favor.

I think there is quite a bit of gain in decentralizing the processing algorithms, to be honest. Even if the real-life events are centralized, moving the point of manipulation lower in the stack increases the collateral costs of manipulation. If I want to cheat a bet or contract using a centralized service, or just outright rob a service, only things tied to that service will be affected, and I only have to worry about compromising one service. However, if I can't cheat the service and instead have to cheat n-of-m oracles, which themselves might be relied on by a bunch of other services, it increases both the difficulty and complexity of coming up with an exploit that results in a net positive for myself and/or my organization.

This is me getting on the same page as them. You can't get a majority on the same page unless you first get a minority. And I don't really believe in the correctness of the majority anyway. Argumentum ad populum is a logical fallacy.
The oil industry benefits a lot of people, but I oppose them. The banking industry benefits a lot of people, but I oppose them. The question here is not about whether an arrangement benefits a lot of people or not. The question is whether our community is being harmed by perpetuating the juvenile, male-centric culture that we've inherited from the tech and finance fields.


If you're an attractive woman applying for a traditionally "female" position, then you're more likely to be employed. You'll still get paid less, but you *are* more likely to be employed. If the job is traditionally male, however, you are *less* likely to be employed. On the other hand, if you'e an attractive man, then you're more likely to be employed *regardless* of whether the job is traditionally "male" or "female." Attractiveness is the primary factor, not sex. And even for attractive women, their sex can put them at a *disadvantage.*
(Source: 
And at any rate, I "changed topics" because your greater point was that women have an unfair advantage over men in the workplace because they can use their looks to get a job. I was granting your point (even though, as I note above, it's not a valid one) but pointing out that men also had an unfair advantage due to their tendency to get paid more for the same work.


The government *did* have to intervene to change attitudes. It forced integration, remember? Why do you *think* it's considered wrong now? Sometimes "the desires of the people" are harmful. I'm not saying that we should ban sex in all commercials. That would be censorship. All I'm saying is that it's crap like this that makes tech spaces like ours unwelcoming for a lot of women.

Anyway, I'm obviously not against money as a concept, at least not yet. I see the problems with it, but I also don't see any viable alternatives. But centralization is definitely something I think we should have less of, if it can be helped. It's dangerous, having a single point of failure and a single point of control. Bitcoin gives us a decentralized alternative to our current, centralized system of money issuance. Projects like Mastercoin, Namecoin, and Colored Coins are working to decentralize even more aspects of our current system. That's what appeals to me about them. It's the dissemination of power.

Creating an on-blockchain market for oracles is one of the things I want to do. And right now I'm in the process of building an unemployment insurance app, as well as a decentralized marketplace. You could do both by augmenting Bitcoin with some other P2P tech (as OpenBazaar has), but it's just more of a headache and requires more effort. It feels like shoehorning Bitcoin into something it was never meant to do.
One of the things that really excited me about Bitcoin when I got into it in 2011 was its potential for smart contracts. But for all the talk of on-blockchain financial instruments and self-maintaining IoT devices, not much ever came to fruition. Digging into the scripting language myself, I wasn't able to see how much of anything beyond what had already been demonstrated could be done with it, at least not without going off-blockchain. At first I figured I was just too dumb to see how something so limited could give rise to the sorts of smart contracts people were talking about, but as I saw things like OpenBazaar getting built, I realized that it was exactly as limited as it looked.

1) Looks like 35 active nodes right now, with a total network hash rate of 1.5Gh/s. [Here's]( a stats page. Depending on the Ethereum client you're running, testnet blockchain size runs from 10GB to 40GB. [State tree pruning]( would have brought that down to about 1.4GB. I also expect the blockchain to grow more slowly once we're playing with real ether and not being [rewarded for spamming the blockchain](
2) It's a testnet chain, so it's probably going to get wiped out with Frontier. The mainnet chain launch at Frontier looks like it won't be checkpointed or anything, though, since the pre-release testing has gone better than expected.

I mean, if you know how the supply will be affected before it *is* affected, then that expectation would start affecting the price before the supply actually changes. If I know the supply will be drastically dropping one week from now, I may also expect the price to jump up. So I will buy with the expectation of the price increasing if my capital allows and if I think that others have not already done so. So... you're basically wrong because humans are indeed capable of thinking about and planning for the future.
However, I *will* grant that the price won't find its true level until well after the supply has dropped. The speculation on how the change in supply will affect the price will likely bring us to an incorrect price point.

Totally. Save that seedpool, whatever you do! BitAddress.org uses a deterministic, 100% Javascript PRNG. If you can reinitialize the PRNG with the same seedpool, you'll get back the same addresses you got in the first place. Is that something you can do, or would you like a tool to help get it done? (Swamped with work at the moment, but might be able to put something together for you later today or tomorrow. Already somewhat familiar with the code after studying it while putting together  so it should be pretty easy for me to do.)
Of course, don't rely on this. I could end up being wrong and then you'll be glad you kept your computer's memory in more or less the same state it was in initially.

Yeah, it's a weird line of thought to me too, but it seems fairly solid. [Eris Industries]( can probably explain the idea better than I could.

In Silicon Valley, pretty easily. Here in Portland, where the devs are cheaper, I know new computer science graduates pulling in upwards of $80k per year in entry-level positions. If you're not making at least $80k as a developer, you're kind of getting shafted, IMO. (Or you're just doing Wordpress installs or something like that. In which case, if you have a degree you're wasting it.) If you have some experience and are working in a specialized field like crypto, I can see that being worth at least $100k in a cheap market.

Primarily it's the more compact blockchain and the (in theory) ASIC-resistant POW (and later the POS). There's also a "Whisper" protocol for direct, secure P2P messaging, but that's something I'm sure Counterparty could also easily fork, if they haven't already.
I give them credit for developing the stuff, too. While Counterparty might've done a good job copying them, we wouldn't have had those innovations without them. Counterparty is just playing catch up.
**Edit:** It occurs to me that someone clever might say, "what do you mean Counterparty has just been playing catch up? They've got a live EVM and Ethereum doesn't!" It's important to note that Ethereum has a testnet going right now and *had* a testnet going when Counterparty forked their project, ported it to their platform, and released it on the Bitcoin mainnet. That was their perogative and their risk. Luckily for them it worked out okay. Ethereum, meanwhile, has further refined their system and released new versions, and are currently putting their "release candidate" through a security audit.

Resistance is of course always relative. It may turn out that it, like many other things, *can* be centralized given enough time and effort. But there are things you can do to make it harder or easier.

Their use case sounds like nothing more than "loyalty points," but maybe I'm wrong. Using a blockchain is of course a way to do that, but what exactly do they think using a blockchain will do for them, aside from get them a brief boost in media visibility? Is there anything beyond that, I wonder?

There's a testnet for POC  going that you can play with, and they're wrapping up POC  on their dev branches.

Spamming the blockchain like that would raise the profitability of mining and thus the price she'd have to pay to "buy out" any miners. So that's out.

Probably because I said "Ethereum." :D
Honestly, multi-sig is great, but it doesn't totally prevent a service from running off with the funds. As long as you're decrypting your private key in the browser, there's a chance that a hostile service will immediately send that decrypted key back to the server. One would hope one would notice that, but I imagine it'd be a while before anyone actually did. The only way around that kind of problem is to use something like a Trezor, and that's still a ways off from mass adoption.
One footnote on Ethereum/Counterparty: I think the more of a service's logic one can move onto the blockchain, the better. Doing so reduces the portion of the app that relies on a central point of failure and allows for more complex rules around withdrawing currency from an address. In theory, one could build an entire market on Ethereum/Counterparty and place orders and list items entirely from a generic wallet. It'd be less user-friendly than going through the app's front door, but it'd work. And for those who end up MITMed by some browser-based GUI, having some combination of a daily withdrawal limit when using their day-to-day key and a "withdraw everything" key that stays encrypted offline until the day-to-day key gets compromised would be useful.
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:44:37
Counterparty has only implemented Ethereum's scripting language. There's a lot more to Ethereum than its scripting language. And while Ethereum hasn't yet been officially released, it's got a testnet you can join and play with.

Why do they even need a blockchain for that?
@_date: 2015-03-13 07:35:57
Wait, what? Lower difficulty doesn't change the ratio of hash power one needs relative to the network to pull off a 51% attack. As I understand it, the problem arises primarily from the increased number of stale blocks due to the larger time difference between average block time and average block propagation.
@_date: 2015-03-18 04:16:25
Were they using client-side encrypted wallets, supposedly? That would be interesting to know. Those could still be compromised by the service itself, of course, but it would be somewhat harder.
Ethereum-based services could theoretically resolve these sorts of issues. Since Counterparty theoretically has an Ethereum implementation going, someone could build on *that* right now if they wanted to.

The cost of compromising the Bitcoin network (or any other POW network, really) can be considered to be identical to the cost of bribing some combination of pool operators who collectively control 51% of the network's hashrate. Assuming that pool operators are rational actors, this figure is likely less than the cost of actually obtaining the necessary hardware oneself. If we assume pool operators are rational actors, that the average pool fee (weighted by hashrate) is 1%, and that the average pool operator has a 10 year outlook, it'd cost $7,589,461.15 to bribe enough pool operators to get 51% of the network's hashrate. That's 51% of ten years worth of earnings from taking a 1% cut of the blocks produced by the whole network, given the current exchange rate.
The cost of compromising a POS system is derived from its staking participation rate. You'd need 51% of the currently staking deposits to compromise the system. At ether's current price, you'd need a staking participation rate of 18.5% to match Bitcoin's security. This seems fairly reasonable. And if the value of ether rises, the participation rate can drop and still maintain the same level of security.
**Edit:** Also, POS isn't a hashing algorithm. It's a method of securing a blockchain such that any full node on the network can also be a "staker." That's a much larger set of people than can be miners in POW schemes.

@_date: 2015-03-13 07:48:47
Honestly, there are good technical reasons behind why they chose to start a new project rather than trying to weld something onto Bitcoin. Bitcoin is just too limited to support all the things Ethereum is trying to do. Building on top of Bitcoin just wouldn't have made sense outside of trying to maximize the profits of those invested in Bitcoin. And I say this as someone who is *very* heavily invested in Bitcoin.

Umm... it launched a couple months ago. Not vaporware anymore.


Not sure, but the upcoming switch to POS might remedy that. And to be honest, I think POS is more decentralization-friendly than POW is. So... I like Ethereum more on that score.
@_date: 2015-03-27 03:04:40
Unfortunately you can only mine SHA256 POW coins with Bitcoin mining hardware, so Primecoin's straight out. I don't think there are any coins using SHA256 proof of work that do anything like Primecoin does.
@_date: 2015-03-10 17:00:40
It is pretty cool, but there's unfortunately no way they, as a metacoin, will be able to achieve the same efficiency as Ethereum. Not until we get sidechains going and they can move off to their own blockchain. Assuming that's how sidechains work, of course. Haven't looked into them enough yet.
@_date: 2015-03-13 23:39:48
Efficiencies of scale are not universally applicable, though. I don't think they apply in the case of coins that can be mined best by consumer-grade electronics simply because buying or creating a CPU specifically for the sake of mining yields less marginal value than turning a CPU one had bought previously for its own sake to mining when it's not in use.
But here I am of course assuming such a POW scheme may be had at all, which it may not. Ethereum is planning on moving to POS itself after launch, after all.
You may have a point regarding the implementation details there. It's a highly risky venture with a high likelihood of failure. But its aim is higher than Counterparty's, and I like its design better. I can't say it'll beat out Counterparty as the preferred smart contract platform, but I do hope it does because again, I like its design better. I hope they succeed. We'll see if they do.

As someone with anarchist leanings who got into Bitcoin in 2011 because of the fact that I thought it had a shot at breaking up a few large centers of power, I've really got no problem with anything that seeks to help empower the disempowered. Tar and feather me and call me a "cultural Marxist" if you like, but I do think it's important to look at ourselves and ask how effective we've been at getting our ideas out into other demographics and communities.

Didn't downvote, but I'll take a crack at explaining why others might have. There's a good argument to be had for specialized blockchains for different sets of needs. It's unlikely that all other coins will die off if blockchains really take off. Also, there's some real resistance to changing Bitcoin's core bits, like the scripting language. And no way the mining algorithm is ever changing, given how much has been invested in ASICs at this point. While Bitcoin *could* evolve, it'll be a slow and painful process, with some real, hard barriers along the way that Ethereum or other greenfield projects won't have to deal with.

In case you hadn't noticed, a lot of the people who've recently gotten involved with Bitcoin aren't exactly honey badgers when it comes to the government. If the government intervenes, I have no doubt that Bitcoin will continue functioning somewhere on some level. But it will be severely limited due to the difficulty of routing around the constricting laws.
As far as large mining interests go, that still could be a problem in the event that someone with great enough personal wealth decides to gain a majority network share and then destroy the network for shits and giggles. "Some men just want to watch the world burn," and while I don't think most people with enough wealth to pull that sort of thing off are disdainful enough of their own wealth to do so, we shouldn't completely rule it out.

It did sound like you were basically panhandling in your original post, to be honest.
Anyway, it's pretty obvious that you *are* frustrated. Maybe you don't want to call it "butthurt," but it's basically the same thing in my book. And I think you're putting words in the wrong mouths here. Most of the "old timer" Bitcoiners are Ayn-Rand-loving Libertarians and couldn't give a shit about the gap between the rich and poor. Mostly they just want less government.
And the best way to earn bitcoin has almost never been mining. There were some folks who got lucky with Avalon's first batch, a bit less that got lucky with their second batch, and a handful that were perfectly positioned to make a bunch with GPU mining early on. But the vast majority of the time, mining bitcoin has been a losing proposition. That's because it's the most obvious, easiest thing to do. People hear about Bitcoin and immediately want to start mining, and a lot of them don't know how to properly calculate whether it'll be profitable or not. About half of them don't seem to understand that running their rigs at a loss means they'd be better off just spending their electricity money on buying bitcoin directly. And a good number just want to mine for fun and don't care about profit. So you end up with long stretches of time where, unless you're getting your electricity for free or mining with racks of high-tech ASIC miners you designed and built yourself, *you lose money on mining.*
The best way to earn bitcoin has always been creating goods and services and offering them for bitcoin. It's not the easiest way, but the ROI has historically been a lot better than the ROI on mining. Probably because, as I said, it's not the easiest way.
Best of luck.

I'm sorry you're having such a hard time of it. I don't feel Bitcoin is a "secret club," as you say. It *is* certainly at least as hard to get bitcoin as it is to get any other currency. Perhaps a bit harder, if you first earn a currency and then use it to buy bitcoin. But we're very open about our currency and there are plenty of places to buy in. You can also try earning it by getting a job on the Bitcoin job boards, but I'm assuming you've tried that. (I do know you've been looking in the conventional places for the past two years.)
As for the "butthurt-ness" you mention, we're not all libertarians here, but they do comprise a large percentage of our population. And honestly, the replies you received sounded more like the usual libertarian lack of empathy and "pull yourself up by your bootstraps" garbage than any kind of butthurt. *You* sound butthurt, but they didn't so much.

Exactly. The "hoard 'em, don't spend 'em" argument strikes me as about as short-sighted as the infamous "miner's fallacy": "if bitcoin goes up enough in price, it will make my hardware investment worthwhile, no matter that I spent $5,000 on it when bitcoin was a mere $100 apiece."

Look, if you're providing a service for government regulators to more easily track Bitcoin, they aren't going to let you control that service forever. Maybe they'll let you guys stay on as figureheads. Maybe they'll be nice about it and install backdoors so they can use your system however they want without you knowing. But one thing has become clear to me: our government will do whatever it takes to take whatever it wants. I suppose you may have the best of intentions, but I can't help but think you're in over your head on this one. If this makes our government as transparent as the blockchain, I have fewer qualms. But I have no illusions that they will allow that to happen.

Because mining is an attractive prospect for people and because people seem to think Litecoin's scrypt algorithm will keep the majority of the network's hashing power from accumulating in the hands of a privileged few. (I am quite doubtful on that point, but that's their line of thought.)
@_date: 2013-12-05 06:46:34
Yes, I do. For me, Bitcoin isn't so much about the free market as it is about freedom from unfair currency manipulation. A free currency does not make a free market. As long as factories must be inspected and meatspace regulations followed, we aren't dealing with an unfettered free market.
I like Bitcoin because it cuts out middlemen who have demonstrated that they cannot be trusted. I like Bitcoin because it takes the power of currency issuance out of corruptible human hands and surrenders it to incorruptible, publicly verifiable algorithms. Anything that takes power out of the hands of humans and puts it in the hands of a public, transparent system, I'm generally in favor of. But by no means do I worship at the altar of Ayn Rand.
@_date: 2013-11-28 01:59:39
Which part?
The "miner's fallacy" is called that because you'll hear it from a lot of Bitcoin miners. It comes from not understanding opportunity cost and from basing your ROI in fiat instead of bitcoin. If you hear a miner talking about how they might "make ROI" (i.e., break even) if the bitcoin price keeps rising, you're hearing the miner's fallacy. If you hear a miner boasting about how they kept running their miner even when the cost of electricity was more than the value of the bitcoin they were mining and now the 5 BTC they essentially paid $1000 (plus the cost of their equipment) for is now worth $5000, you're hearing the miner's fallacy. They don't get that they basically bought 5 BTC at $200 a bitcoin when the exchange rate was only, say, $100.
In other words, the miner's fallacy comes from not understanding that when you get involved in mining, you are essentially placing a bet on the idea that funding your mining equipment will get you more bitcoin than simply buying bitcoin at the market price. If you spent $5,000 on mining equipment when 1 bitcoin was worth $100, and you only mine 5 BTC, then you've missed out on at least 45 BTC in terms of opportunity cost. If 1 bitcoin is suddenly worth $1,000, then you've broken even in terms of fiat, but getting involved in mining was never a play for fiat in the first place. And besides that, you would have been much better off just buying bitcoin, since the 50 BTC your investment funds would have gotten you now would have been worth $50k.
Even worse are the miners who run their rigs at a loss. They don't seem to grasp the fact that they would get *more* bitcoin (and thus fiat, if they care about that) if they just kept their rigs switched off and spent the money they *would* have spent on electricity directly on bitcoin instead. These guys... I really just don't know what to say to them when I run across them in meatspace. They are part of the reason mining is a losing game right now.
Anyway, now for the "hoard, don't spend" fallacy. First off, let me point out the fact that it's contradictory to believe so strongly that bitcoin is going to rise in value that you don't want to spend any of it, and yet keep a large portion of your wealth in fiat. I get that you don't want to expose yourself to more risk than necessary. But every time you spend fiat instead of bitcoin, you're increasing your exposure to bitcoin anyway by increasing the percentage of your wealth that is denominated in bitcoin. And worse, you're increasing your exposure while simultaneously undermining your own investment. If you want Bitcoin to spread and succeed, you *have* to spend. If the Bitcoin economy ends up stagnating because everyone is hoarding, then you prove that deflationary currencies *are* a bad idea and Bitcoin itself ends up fading away, relegated to a small niche market at best.
Wealth is wealth. Like said, it doesn't matter if you're spending fiat or bitcoin at Subway, save for the fact that spending one helps Bitcoin and spending the other undermines it. If you spend bitcoin on, say, Subway, and then turn around and spend the fiat that you *would* have spent on Subway on bitcoin, you'll not only still have your bitcoin stash, but you'll have helped Bitcoin itself.

Which is why you decide whether you want USD or bitcoin and then you stick with it until a major shift convinces you to do otherwise. If you were converting directly to USD, you lost nothing. If you were accepting at $400 and holding the bitcoin, you're still up over 100% on those sales, even if you *are* down 25% on your Black Friday sales at the moment. Make a sober-eyed decision about what appeals to you, stick with it, and accept the consequences of your choice. You won't win them all, no matter what you choose, so choose what matters to *you*.

I'm sure it is! There's a lot in the PUA community that's helpful. The whole community is geared toward helping people without the confidence necessary to do well in life *gain* that confidence. Unfortunately it also tends to impart an extremely oversimplified and cynical view of women and social interactions. It's gotten you to a better place, but please be careful with it. There's a lot of poison mixed in with that medicine. Your goal should be to eventually transcend the PUA community. Present as a high-value person, *become* a high-value person, but don't imagine that women fundamentally want assholes, and don't imagine that every social interaction has a definite winner and loser. I see the PUA community in the same terms I see religion: tell yourself whatever you need to hear to get to the next level of your life, but don't become so attached to the fiction that you can't abandon it when the time comes, and don't lose sight of the fact that, no matter how helpful the framework has been for you, it could still be wrong and it could still become a hindrance eventually.

Well, the exchange it was on before, GLBSE, shut down. Burnside built BTC-TC so it could have a new home. And the stock on BTC-TC is just a pass-through to direct shares on MPEX, so the shares will still be there even if BTC-TC fails. (The pass-through is a valuable service, though, since MPEX requires a 30 BTC registration fee from its users.)
My understanding is that ASICMINER.PT shares will still have value even if BTC-TC shuts down. We'll just have to move to another trading method for a while until something else starts up to take its place.

If the two parties involved are only interested in sending and receiving fiat, there should be absolutely no reason for either party to hold it for a week and lose 30%. I imagine they'd buy and sell immediately before and after the transaction in order to minimize risk from market fluctuations. In fact, if you could get a third party involved as a hedge against market fluctuations, you could bring your risk down to zero.

If you use Mt. Gox merchant services or another "green" (trusted) address aware processor like Bitpay via your mobile device, and if the user pays using a green address from a well-known place like Mt. Gox, then you should see the transaction as confirmed on your mobile device instantly. If the customer isn't using a green address and you're worried about scammers, you can wait at most 10 minutes (5 minutes on average) for the transaction to get incorporated into a block.
And it's all about the smartphones. You have a smartphone client and the vendor has a smartphone or a tablet? You're golden.

That's the definition of repressed. If you're so shy and busy that you decide the idea of sex either doesn't interest you or flat out disgusts you, and your sexual drive starts attaching to body pillows with prints of anime characters on them to the point where you feel comfortable sincerely calling it your girlfriend, that strikes me as pretty repressed.
I know it's a small percentage that does the body pillow thing, but the denial of any sexual interest at all is *not* unusual for young people in Japan. And that sounds like there's some repression going on.
Edit: Also, I don't mean to bash on your country of residence. I was very much into Japanese anime and manga culture as a teenager, and now that I'm older I still find a lot to respect and like about Japan.

Out of curiosity, do you consider gold a pyramid scheme? It's no more "income producing" than Bitcoin is.
At any rate, you seem to be arguing against a different point from the one I was making. By buying with Bitcoin, I'm helping create a stronger Bitcoin economy. I'm bringing the day nearer when whole production cycles can be contained entirely within Bitcoin. I'm treating Bitcoin as an end unto itself, rather than as a mere means of obtaining more fiat.

As a consumer, it's still a PITA if my credit card number gets leaked, or if someone tries to put fraudulent charges on it, regardless of consumer protections.

But I'm fairly security-saavy, and I keep everything encrypted anyway.
On top of this, I like supporting a system that is (IMO) more future-proof than the central banking system.

Erm. You're implying that Bitcoin is simply a revolving door? I guess in a lot of ways it is, since there are very few places right now where Bitcoin "touches ground," so to speak. That is, most supply chains for Bitcoin vendors are not Bitcoin-based all the way down. But I don't think that'll hold true forever. And there's still the fact that you can buy goods and services with Bitcoin, and that some of the people selling those goods and services are opting to hold their profits in Bitcoin.

Because you have to provide a bitcoin address to receive payment.

I'm looking at using CampBX now, actually. As far as Coinbase goes, it turns out my account had been flagged because they had credited me $192 for a failed transaction, and my bank had done the same, thus effectively double-crediting my bank account. My post here earned me enough extra attention for that very important detail to come out, and they returned my account to normal after I returned the extra $192 I was credited.

Once upon a time, CampBX was the easiest to get money into. They were partnered with Dwolla, and you could fund your exchange account via Dwolla. But Dwolla decided to stop dealing with CampBX for whatever reason, and now the only way to get money in is by mailing a money order or (if you provide a bunch of personal info and get approved) personal check. There *are* a few beta testers who can now deposit funds via ACH, but that's not a feature most users have access to yet.
BTC-E is a PITA to deal with. I've tried getting money in, but pretty much every service they work with seems sketchy as hell. I know lots of people have managed to get funds in, but I just can't bring myself to do it.
For Bitstamp, you can either get a Ripple account and use SnapSwap to get money into Ripple and then deposit into Bitstamp from your Ripple account, or you can wire funds to a bank in Slovenia. I've personally wired funds to them before, and they showed up in my account the next day. Was very nervous about the whole thing, though, as I'm sure you can imagine.
If you want to try the SnapSwap/Ripple method, you might find this page helpful:

Two things I would change on it:
- The URI encoded in the QR code is malformed, so the Schildbach wallet on my phone cannot use it.
- The QR code and address should probably disappear once payment is received and the "payment received" message should probably be more pronounced.

I like SI notation myself, but I'm coming around to the fact that Americans just aren't willing to adapt. So bits (1/1,000,000) or satoshis (1/100,000,000) are good, IMO.
The problem with "bits" is that there are a couple different definitions floating around.

A simple app that will take the coins sent to it and create forward-dated transactions that release the coins in equal, discrete chunks, allowing for a budgeting tool that can't be circumvented. So if you want 10 mBTC a day for a month, you tell the app to create a timed-release account that releases once a day for a month until empty. Send 300 mBTC to it and watch it trickle back into one of your Bitcoin addresses over the course of 30 days.

"Computer stuff" is always an option, yeah. :-D
Last year I paid a couple graphic designers in bitcoin, and I've gotten one small programming gig myself that paid bitcoin. There seems to be an overabundance of programmers in this space (look at and you'll see what I mean), but if you can do something that's *not* directly programming that happens to combine nicely with programming, you might be able to do better than the rest of us code monkeys.
Starting a business seems to be a pretty good model for making bitcoin at the moment. If you can take something someone else is doing for fiat and do it for bitcoin instead (assuming you can do it *well*), you've basically got an instant business. You'll have to do proper marketing, of course, but you can at least be assured that there *is* a market for what you're doing.
@_date: 2013-11-09 20:23:17
Buy with some amount you're willing to lose. I think that Bitcoin is here to stay and that this price will seem a pittance in ten years, but that's me. I think it's going to crash once it stops going up like mad, and I hope it crashes below the buy order I put in this morning, but long term I am decidedly bullish.
And think of it this way: if I'm right, most prices in the future will be denominated in mBTC at the most, and probably even uBTC eventually. And you can certainly afford a couple hundred mBTC and a couple thousand uBTC, even with the price at an all time high.
But whatever you do, don't panic sell. This is a long-term investment, IMO. If you're the type to panic sell, wait until the current bubble has clearly popped. It might pop down to a higher price than it's currently at, or it might go lower than the current price, but you at least will not have to ride that particular gut-wrenching rollercoaster.

I think this is mostly a product of Bitcoin's deep geek appeal. There are not many women in the STEM fields, and a lot of that has to do with the hostility, direct and indirect, that they encounter in a lot of tech communities. It doesn't take much to send a message stating "you don't belong here."
There is a woman I know who runs a Python meetup in town. The group seems to be about 50% women at most of the meetups I've been to. It's not that there are not women who are interested. It's that they face far more hurdles than men do in STEM fields. And she has successfully created a space where women feel safe and welcomed, where the hurdles aren't so numerous for women.
Unfortunately I've heard enough stories to know that most tech spaces are *not* welcoming. That even outright, physical sexual harassment is not unusual at tech conventions. &lt;trigger warning&gt;I know another woman in the tech scene who was raped at a convention she was helping put on. And then at yet another convention someone decided to put their hand down her pants to grope her. In both cases, when she spoke out about what had happened, she was essentially told to shut up and stop rocking the boat. And from the stories that come across my Twitter feed, this seems to be about how it's usually handled.&lt;/trigger warning&gt;
Add on to that the gender roles that we push onto people their entire lives, and it's really not surprising that tech scenes in general tend to be sausage fests.

**Scrooge:** I wish to be left alone, sir! That is what I wish! I don't make myself merry at Christmas and I cannot afford to make idle people merry. I have been forced to support the establishments I have mentioned through taxation and God knows they cost more than they're worth. Those who are badly off must go there.
**2nd Portly Gentleman:** Many would rather die than go there.
**Scrooge:** If they'd rather die, then they had better do it and decrease the surplus population. Good night, gentlemen.
Seriously though, you seem to have little understanding of how the world really works. You don't seem to have any conception of how poverty limits the choices of people who have found themselves in it, and how those who are well off exploit this vulnerability to further increase their own wealth. There is a *reason* the rich are getting richer and the poor are getting poorer. That is how capitalism *works.* That is the *free market* I'm betting you love. *Power builds on itself, and monetary wealth is a form of power.*
Fixing the system isn't as simple as saying, "well, those idiots should just get better jobs and decrease the surplus waiter population." There is complexity to the issues behind social inequality, and a simple, glib answer like yours does nothing to address it. And you ought to care about addressing it, because social inequality ultimately impoverishes all of us, well-off though you may be. You cannot pretend to be an island, separate from the people who form the world around you. If your neighbor is hurting, their pain will find its way to you one way or another.
At any rate, I do think that a basic guaranteed yearly salary would be preferable to another minimum wage hike. A basic guaranteed yearly salary could be more efficient than more nuanced social programs, and it would mitigate the harm caused by the displacement of workers by technology. It would move us toward the kind of world technology has for so long promised and yet failed to deliver. But between the two, guess which one is more likely to get passed? So you pick your battles and limit your expectations, and I say the "tipped wage" system is bullshit.

Haha. Try running a mining operation of 5 machines with 3 video cards each. I thought it would be pretty simple, too, until I discovered the circuit breaker I was using couldn't handle that much draw, that the only surge protectors I could find were rated for only 1.8Kwh (each machine was drawing just over 1.2Kwh), and that they *really* weren't kidding about those machines running hot! I spent so much time getting that all set up, and so much time trying to make sure it *stayed* set up. (Nothing like being a day's drive away from your mining rigs and watching their hashes per second mysteriously plummet to zero!)
Plus there's the tweaking of configuration files, trying to squeeze a few more Mh/s out of the cards, watching the forums to see if any new, shiny mining software with new, shiny algorithms or protocols have popped up...
Yeah, those were good days, but I hated them at the time. So much stress! Still, it was pretty cool seeing the BTC trickling into my mining pool accounts and knowing that I was becoming part of history. That I was helping create a part of the future.

There's not a lot right now that explains it in plain language, as most of the effort toward getting Bitcoin accepted in the mainstream has been directed toward just getting people to accept that it is indeed a legitimate medium of exchange.

It's also the regulatory environment here in the US. If I wanted to set up a Bitcoin ATM like the one in Canada, I'd have to register as a money transmitter and pay the hundreds of thousands of dollars it takes to satisfy that particular regulatory hurdle in my state. I used to let people buy bitcoin with credit cards (never got a single chargeback), but I stopped recently because I didn't fancy FINCEN breaking down my door. Places like Canada and Germany have it much easier because they don't have to jump through those hoops.

Mining doesn't apply to XRP because it's centralized. If it weren't, it would need mining. The point he was trying to make was that the folks running Ripple control the supply and distribution of the currency. Thus it is essentially "premined."
I've researched Ripple myself and, honestly, their claims to "decentralization" and "open source" are so tentative that I can't at all blame anyone for thinking them malicious. Their client is the only open source thing about them, and the "decentralization" comes from the fact that you can write your own client instead of using theirs. The server and the currency itself is very much closed source and centralized. *This* is e-gold and Beenz and Facebook Credits all over again, albeit with a more interesting spin.
EDIT: Sorry, I do acknowledge that the owners claim it will be open source and decentralized "in the future," but until that happens, it really is just another e-gold.
@_date: 2013-12-07 16:25:19
Yeah. I guess the big thing for me is that it's a decentralized technology. Going into the future, we're going to have to start building and using more things like Bitcoin if we're going to avoid the sort of draconian control that would be necessary to keep the crazy technology we'll have in a hundred years or so in check. (Assuming we don't blow ourselves up before then, of course.)
So I'm a fan of decentralization and transparency in general. I feel it's more socially responsible to support systems that are decentralized and transparent than it is to support systems that are centralized and opaque.
The fact that it's easier for me to spend bitcoin than it is to use a credit card is just icing on the cake. It helps that almost all of my (admittedly quite small) wealth, save for two retirement accounts and a couple hundred in emergency funds, is in bitcoin, so I almost never have to buy more when I spend some. It's not like I have any fiat to do it with anyway! :-)

And perhaps nobody cares. I haven't been on this subreddit as much as I've been on the Bitcoin Talk forums, so I haven't been witness to the victim narrative.


Okay, I thought that might've been the case. I'm sorry things are going shitty for you, and I can totally see how coming into a subreddit with a bunch of people complaining about relatively banal problems would be frustrating. I don't imagine there's anything I can do to help, and I don't imagine you'd want to spell out everything shitty going on in your life for a random Internet stranger, but I do hope things go better for you.

The terrible thing is that if you'd spent the last two years teaching yourself web development, you'd probably have already found yourself a pretty decent job. I'm glad you're trying, and I'm sorry it hasn't worked out for you yet. Sometimes people get really unlucky.
At any rate, the cool thing about Bitcoin is that it's a non-governmental currency. This makes it perfect as an international reserve currency, since no single government "owns" it. Bitcoin never claimed it would make life fair for everyone. It will make banks less necessary and allow for escrow services where the escrow service never has to touch the money. But the gap between the rich and the poor is another problem altogether, one which Bitcoin has never pretended to be about solving.
If you want a coin predicated on creating economic fairness and equality, try Freicoin. I don't recommend it myself, though, since the moment you obtain Freicoin it starts draining slowly out of your wallet. (That's how they ensure relative fairness and equality: nobody can get rich just by saving their money. You have to continually provide something of value to the market to become and stay rich.)

I think it would. Most people aren't interested in making themselves targets of the US Government, and so they'd fall in line pretty readily. Especially over something like this, which has long been an accepted role for the government. The concept of a decentralized currency is more foreign to most US citizens than the concept of a government-issued one.

You know, a China-based company offering PCB assembly and fabrication for BTC could probably do pretty well. That would be one step down the supply chain.
I think you're spot on here: the next step isn't necessarily to get more consumer-facing vendors to use Bitcoin, but to get at least one production chain to go 100% Bitcoin. Once that happens, it'll allow for an outward spread of Bitcoin usage back up the supply chain.
EDIT: Weren't there some Argentinian farmers on this subreddit offering their produce for Bitcoin earlier?

It provides the warm, fuzzy feeling that comes from helping people download the blockchain faster. Same as seeding torrents provides warm fuzzies.
The network accepts the node by the node contacting it and then seeding the blockchain on port 8333. If port 8333 is blocked for whatever reason, your node is only leeching.
Currently the blockchain is (I hear) 15 GB, and it takes at least 512 MB of RAM to run a node. In my experience, 1 GB is better if you're planning to have the node do things like send transactions and generate addresses, though. I've had nodes regularly go down after about 24 hours due to memory constraints on Amazon EC2 Tiny instances before.

That's fair. For brick and mortar businesses (and even reputable online businesses), though, I don't think the lack of chargebacks should be a huge problem for consumers. It *is* just like using cash.
At any rate, the Bitcoin protocol itself allows for escrow. It's built right into the reference client. Most people don't use it, though, because there isn't a pretty GUI front end for it yet. I imagine the major merchant services will be adding it soon. At least I hope they will, because it's pretty simple to do (from my perspective, anyway).

He can cash out very easily using Coinbase. If you go through the whole verification process, you can sell bitcoin and have the cash in your checking account the next business day. The verification process does take some time, though, so you'll want to start that about a week ahead of when you think you'll want to cash out.
In the meantime, make sure he has an objective in mind and help him hold to that. The price of bitcoin is the most volatile thing I have *ever* seen, so it's going to take iron fortitude to make a plan and stick with it. Drops of 50% or more can happen. Drops of over 25% are not uncommon. In 2011, we saw the price go from $1 to $31 and then back to a low of $2 before slowly rising back up to the $13 to $17 range, where it stayed until the beginning of this year. At this point, I don't think we'll ever go back below $100, but there are never any guarantees.
If he just wants some extra money to help him buy his car and is hoping bitcoin will help him get it, then have him set a get-out price and hold him to it. I don't think we'll see any drops as extreme as the drop of 2011, since the whole Bitcoin ecosystem is a lot more mature now than it was then, but I guarantee there will be some scary drops.
Take it from someone who has lost a lot of bitcoin and yet still managed to hold on to enough to be far ahead of his original investment: do *not* panic sell. I think we'll be up to at least double what we are now within the next two years (conservatively), but it's going to be a very wild ride.
**Edit:** And make sure he keeps his bitcoin wallet backed up. If that file's lost or compromised, the bitcoin is gone. If he's not comfortable managing his wallet's security himself, have him use Blockchain.info and make sure he turns on two-factor authentication. That's the most secure online wallet I know of. Unlike a lot of other wallet services, they keep your wallet encrypted with your password, so even if someone breaks into their servers, your bitcoin cannot be spent. However, if your computer itself is compromised, it's still possible for someone to steal your bitcoin, unless you have two-factor authentication turned on. At that point, your phone *and* your computer would have to be compromised, which is just plain improbable.

I think you got downvoted because, in torrenting terms, anyone hosting a full blockchain is seeding and anyone not is just leeching. There has been some pushback against people advocating lightweight clients as a result of this fact, despite the fact that the lightweight clients, with their faster bootstrapping times, arguably provide a better first impression of Bitcoin for newcomers than Bitcoin-QT.
IMO, Bitcoin-QT should have the option of running in "lightweight" mode and let the user decide on first run whether they want to just leech, or whether they wouldn't mind waiting the extra time to get the whole blockchain so they can seed.

Nothing. They have all the social connections they need to land a posh job because they have tons of time to go network with people, and any prospective employer is going to look at them and recognize that their no-degree ass is probably a better choice than the college graduate they just saw a moment ago. They probably won't face any health problems that'll wipe out whatever little they manage to save up, and they probably won't be forced to take multiple jobs because their employers won't give them enough hours for them to be considered full-time employees. The fact that they will have to spend 75 hours a week, assuming they are the average American paying average rent and working for the federal minimum wage, amongst their various workplaces in order to afford a zero-bedroom apartment and still have enough money left over for food and other necessities, and maybe a little for saving, doesn't figure in. 75 hours isn't a very long work week, right? Even if you figure in the time they have to spend commuting on public transportation. They're probably getting enough sleep, and they're probably not living in a neighborhood dangerous enough to drive out anyone who can afford to leave. They're probably not a minority, and they probably aren't ever predated on by payday lenders and crooked bankers. You're right, they should just suck it up and go to the library and study their brains out. This is America, after all. Pull yourself up by your bootstraps!

It's already possible to embed data in the blockchain. People have been doing it for a while. This is just another way to do it.
Also, if Bitcoin itself becomes illegal, would you cease to use it? So what if Wikileaks becomes more tightly associated with Bitcoin? In my opinion, civil disobedience is essential to the health of a society. There must be people willing to break unjust laws if justice is to prevail over tyranny. I'd be quite happy to see Wikileaks using the blockchain to publish magnet links.

FTFY. The price will likely go high, but it's going to crash at some point. And then it'll come back up and go higher. This is the pattern we've seen with Bitcoin so far. The temptation to sell for most people, it seems, comes when the price is *dropping,* not when it's rising. If she sells while she's in the green, she probably will be happier than if she sells while she's in the red. Though (IMO) she'll probably be happiest of all if she doesn't sell at all and just waits until she sees something she wants that she can buy with bitcoin to spend it.

It's when banks only hold a fraction of the funds they are responsible for. You give them $100, and they loan $90 out to someone.

But you haven't sold? Historically speaking, that is a wise decision on your part. Panic selling is always a bad idea, especially with Bitcoin. Consider that this crash has only been a crash of about 50%, measured from its ATH to its recent low of the last 24 hours. The first crash was from $30 to $2. The April of 2013 one was from $260 to $60. A crash from $1200 to $600 is downright hospitable, 'round these parts.
I've been involved with Bitcoin since 2011, and the only time I've really actually lost money has been when I've panic sold after a crash. I don't do that anymore. Now I just hold, spend, and convert fiat to bitcoin when I happen to come across it.
Believing in the ethos and purpose behind Bitcoin is important. Finding a reason to believe in Bitcoin is important. If you believe in Bitcoin and want to see if grow beyond being just a speculative investment vehicle, you care less about price fluctuations. You care more about building roots for the thing. You become a positive addition to the community, just like a little extra nitrogen in the soil is a positive addition for plants.
I want to see Bitcoin succeed because I believe a world governed by transparent algorithms collectively agreed upon will be a better world than one governed by corrupt and corruptible politicians and bankers from behind "need to know" policies and closed doors. I believe in Bitcoin because I see danger in bottlenecks and single points of failure.
Technology is not neutral, no matter what people may say. In particular, the design of a technology can either make it resistant or receptive to fascist forms of governance. Centralized technology facilitates control by a privileged few. It takes away power from its users and gives it to its owners. Decentralized technology, on the other hand, keeps the power in the hands of the users. It cannot be controlled by a privileged few. Not easily, anyway. Not directly.
Bitcoin is not just a cool, new technology, or a great investment for the fearless. Bitcoin is a means of shifting power back into the hands of the public.

However, the "time to last block reward" is measured in number of blocks mined since the genesis block. Because of the recent explosive growth of the network, blocks have pretty consistently been getting mined at a rate faster than one every ten minutes.

Fair enough. Like I said, I've spent all the fiat I had (save for a couple hundred) on bitcoin. I've done web development and gotten paid in bitcoin. When I finally *do* get more fiat, I'll be buying bitcoin with it.
There are people treating it as a pyramid scheme, for sure. And, to me, it's very obnoxious to see people getting in on the premise that they'll be able to cash out someday for a bunch of fiat. Back in 2011, I seem to recall the community being a lot more about *building* things than about trading and trying to push the price up.
So I try to act in the spirit of the early community and treat it as an end to itself as much as possible. I always ask the people I do work for to pay me in bitcoin if they can, though I've only had one person take me up on it so far. And I try to build things when I get the chance.

I'm processing all the closed issues by hand at the moment, so I'd probably see the issue was closed, try to figure out *why* it was closed, and then send the bitcoins for the issue on to you. If the issue was *cancelled* or marked as "will not fix" or something along those lines, I would comment on the issue and work with the participants to refund the donations. I would be able to immediately send back anything sent from a bitcoin address associated with a Github account. Anything sent from a large, shared wallet like Mt. Gox's would be much trickier as there is no way to verify bitcoin address ownership in such a case.
In the future I may add the ability to donate to issues via an on-site cold wallet, which would allow for instant refunds in the case of a cancelled issue with donated funds.

Whoah, wait a minute. Letting your grandmother buy bitcoin when she asks is "hoodwinking of the senile?" How do you figure, exactly?

Derp. For some reason I read "fluctuation" instead of "inflation." Must've transposed some letters. Sorry about that!

Coinbase isn't, IMO, a *real* wallet. It's a service provided by a very-much-for-profit business, and it's not a particularly *good* wallet service, from what I've heard. You should host your own wallet if you're comfortable with that. I use Mycellium these days, as it's more power-user-friendly than the Schildbach wallet (which is itself more newbie-friendly). On my desktop and laptop machines, I use Multibit. But if you don't trust yourself with your own bitcoin, then use Blockchain.info's wallet service. They keep your private keys on their servers, but they keep them encrypted with a password you supply when you set up your wallet. The private keys themselves are generated client-side, in your browser, so their servers *never* see your keys "in the clear." As far as I know, they and CoinPunk are the only two take security that seriously. And they have a mobile app, which is always helpful.
But if you do decide to use Blockchain.info, be sure to turn on two-factor authentication, just in case. There *have* been people who have lost bitcoin there because they didn't have it turned on.

Okay, fair enough. Looking at the exchange volume charts, it does look like Gox is still the biggest:
For some reason, I thought Bitstamp had overtaken Gox recently.

This is true. Unfortunately banks don't have much incentive to do this. I imagine they'd be more than happy to see Bitcoin fail.

If nobody *cares* enough about physical delivery to demand it, that's how. And let's face it: most people are used to not caring about that, and thus probably won't.

Transferring the funds immediately would work. You could also use multi-signature transactions and/or smart contracts. Whatever you do, don't hold bitcoin on the website's servers. The best protection against theft is having nothing to steal.
@_date: 2013-08-17 16:25:46
Ah, sorry. I found the discussion I had in mind: 
It sounds like *hashing* would still be safe, and thus quantum computers wouldn't have much effect as far as reverse engineering a private key from a public address is concerned. (Public addresses, for those who don't know, are hashed public keys.)
Still, I imagine there might be a transition period where we move to something even more secure in the future.

Try working for bitcoin and selling things for bitcoin. You can also buy in. I suggest Coinbase if you're in the US and don't plan on day trading. Bitstamp if you plan on day trading.
If you sign up for Coinbase, using this link will give you a $5 credit the first time you buy BTC: 
And hey, have some BTC, as long as we're talking about it:
+3 mBTC

Although if we *could* safely allow purchases via credit card, it would be a pretty big advantage over other currencies...

I.e., if you spend half a bitcoin, just buy half a bitcoin to replace it.

I'm talking about the donation banner on the top of the articles. I don't go to the homepage either. I'm not motivated enough to give money to Wikipedia unless that's there, at which point I realize this is a public good that I've been using and that I ought to probably support it. I don't go searching for a donation link because I'm so goddamn determined to give my money to this non-profit.
@_date: 2013-11-30 02:14:41
Yes, they are. Not sure about the 2FA, though. Haven't gotten a chance to dig into it yet.
And Apple has a long history of removing Bitcoin wallets from the app store. Coinbase was not the first one they've squashed.

I've been helping people grow their businesses by developing web apps for them. I've been building and launching Bitcoin services. I'm not currently mining at all, and I've never played WoW.
Anyway, I'm sorry I assumed so much. Given that you have experience with web development, I *am* somewhat surprised you haven't been able to find work. Is it your panic disorder, do you think? I'm sure you've got a much better handle on what's going on with your situation than I could ever hope to have, but I *am* curious now.

I think he's just telling you *how* he calculated the amount of bitcoin circulating right now. If you want a place that'll just tell you a number, try here: 
1,192,166.18 BTC sent over the network in the last 24 hours, as of this writing.

Monopolies can be formed faster when governments help them, but the natural course of capitalism is toward monopoly. Power begets more power on an exponential curve. And regardless of whether humanity itself is broken, humanity's what we must work with. We need a metaphorical TCP/IP layer on top of our metaphorical hardware layer.

That's really too bad. Bitcoin transactions have the potential to be pretty damn smooth.
@_date: 2013-11-07 22:45:01
If you're dealing on LocalBitcoins, use the escrow feature to speed up the transaction. That way you don't have to wait for confirmations.

I imagine Kyle would say such things would just slow Bitcoin down. You can't stop the signal.

Volatility *is* going down. It *has* become less volatile, which was kind of my point in the first paragraph. 30% price swings like the one we just had were *not* unusual in the early days.
I think volatility is going down because the market is getting bigger. It takes more to move the price. I also think volatility is going down because the market is *less* speculative than it was in the early days, influx of traders and price-centric memes regardless.
Before there was anything you could buy for bitcoin (save for alpaca socks, perhaps), we were *all* speculators. We had no idea where this thing was going to go, and total failure seemed a lot more likely than it does today. Sure, we believed in the idea, but the bitcoin itself had little use. Now there are tens of thousands of places to spend it. There are services cropping up that are starting to make Bitcoin's more advanced features easier to use, such as Bitrated.com. And the more *use* Bitcoin sees, the smaller the fluctuations will become.

400BTC in a year may not be all that attainable, to be honest. Calculating out the known quantity of all Avalon's hardware alone brings us to a network difficulty of 32 million, as opposed to the current 8 million. Add on the power from ASIC-MINER and allow that BFL may indeed ship someday soon and you could be looking at a much higher difficulty. It's true that this guy has a jump on all that, but not much of one...

The private key *is* stored on the server, but it's encrypted with your password client-side, so the server never sees your private key "in the clear." That's what Blockchain.info does too.

Because that's the default scope Github's OAuth asks for, apparently. Sorry, I totally did not notice that. I'll fix it and answer back here when it's set up to request minimal permissions.
**EDIT**: Actually, that's the scope specified in the tutorial I was following at the time. My mistake. I've changed the OAuth scope to request permission to view publicly visible information only.
@_date: 2013-12-05 03:47:57
Nah. Coinbase and Bitstamp both sound riskier than an ETF that you can trade on a better-known, more established platform. If you think there are a lot of speculators in the market *now*, wait until Ameritrade and eTrade and the like get in on the game. People like my dad, who want to get into Bitcoin but can't bring themselves to wire funds to Slovenia or hook their bank account up to some random website they only just heard about, will probably flock to bitcoin ETFs on those platforms.

Understood. I won't be sending any chips off for assembly until the design has been tested.

I'm suspicious. Where's the proof?
Especially since Google's October 20th cache of your website doesn't mention a *thing* about Bitcoin mining: 
The market's still rife with scams these days. CedarTec, anyone?
And yeah... your price points are a little higher than everyone else's, and everyone else's will never break even IMO. Mining really is just becoming an expensive hobby. :-/

Unfortunately that destroys the whole borderless aspect of Bitcoin if I now have to worry about the country of origin. Granted, it's easily enough remedied, but it's still an intrusion of nationalism on a formerly nation-agnostic system. And I don't actually have any dubious transactions, and I even pay my taxes. I'm law abiding. The government (the NSA in particular) doesn't appear to be, and *that's* what bothers me. The government has abused my trust and I'll be damned if I ever again think the law binds them.
At any rate, you did get one thing right: if you didn't do it, someone else was bound to. If you can do this in a completely ungovernable, decentralized manner, it'll do a lot to allay my fears around this increasing the power imbalance between our government and its citizens.
