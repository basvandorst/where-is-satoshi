Please have some patience, Rome was not built in a day. If the only reason for you to introducing friends to Bitcoin is for them to buy coffee, I suggest you hold of that for the time being. Rather suggest that they view bitcoin as a high risk, high reward investment, where they should only invest a small amount of what they can afford to loose. By the time they are wealthy, micro-payment solutions are probably available and well tested for them to buy their morning coffee.

A typo correction in a important code-base like Bitcoin is in my opinion extremely important. Not only for the possibility of making sure that developers does not misunderstand something in the future, but also the fact that it proves to the community that the code have had eyes on it.


No this is actually proof that BU developers is making it hard on themselves in the future. I do not think it is a good practice to have one foot in each code-base if the intention is to diverge more than a patched feature.
@_date: 2017-02-20 13:39:45
No, I was simply expanding on your original statement.


100 people with ideas, checking the ideas of the same 100 people, is likely to give a more diverse set of good ideas, than 20 people doing the same.


There is no magic about it, the track-record and management of the Bitcoin core software during the 8 years in existence implies strongly that their ability as a team to discern good vs bad ideas are quite significant.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:30:28
I do not think this is accurate.
I believe that the miners running BU at the moment, is scared to loose out on LN transaction fees, and are hiding as BU supporters. For these miners, the best out come would be BU + LN and the worst would be LN.
Without the possibility for the miners to control the blocksize and thus the fees, LN without BU is a scary place for them.
Other side:
From core position LN is only useful without BU, as the combination gives miners the power to control the LN fees, and their own gains. Newer was a good idea to set a fox to keep the geese.
@_date: 2017-02-28 22:02:54


There is no need to negotiate, it does not even seam possible for BU people to have a technical discussion around the matters. Whenever the BU guys is asked a to defend some reason or some action, their answer is that "it does not matter, the market will decide". I as an engineer find it impossible to comprehend how a negotiation should happen in such a ecosystem.
It was also said that the main goal now is to get core dismantled, and that no action of core should be supported. How to negotiate with something like that? It is not even about Bitcoin development for these guys.

First of all, I guess you are referring to miners by users, and if you by some twisted newspeak actually are talking about users. You might want to explain to people how increasing demands in network,computing and storage is bringing control to users constrained in these resources. You are advocating a decentralizes network where you are giving the western world "Users" the power to displace third world "users". Kind of like current monetary actors FED, world bank etc.

The important thing that Bitcoin brings to market is not "being first" it is not the ability to hash transactions in a immutable list. It is the fact that it is the first online trustless technology with a spotless track-record, accessible to anyone without permission.

Leaving fiat and inflation for deflationary money, the historic economic requirement of growth can also be a thing of the past. Making way for a lower economic pace witch is not set out to fuck up the world. 
So Greed leads to savings instead of over-consumption and exploitation.
Witch would incentivise businesses and industries valuing quality, repearability. Hopefully slow down the growth of the throwaway society.
My hope is also that economic value vil be driven to be more coupled to natural value( social, cultural and resources)

I we assume that the twins own 1% of all bitcoins. and from what I have read the offering is now 100M$. If I understand correctly this 100M$ is backed by some of their bitcoin. If in the first week 300M$ is flowing in to this ETF, I guess they would have to buy 200M$ in bitcoin. Most likely they would buy that from themselves without needing to go to market for them(cashing out a bit).
Is this thinking correct or am I missing something? 
Would they rather go to market for them, to pump price?
@_date: 2017-02-19 23:55:52
As it is today, if some person wanted to transfer 100M$ to the other side of the world in 10 min, he would choose bitcoin(If it was a sane person, caring for his money)
How would the scenario go if the chain was split 2 or even 10 times, would his choice be as straight forward?
One of the reasons Bitcoin has the value and consumer trust today is its history of excellent functioning over 8 years. Do you really think this trust can be divided like playing cards amongst forks? Most people would not know what to make of a situation like that.

Ok, here is a thought experiment:
A  scientist with no knowledge of religion is researching religion and he interviews an atheist and a christian, to "decentralize his sources"(good). This gets him only data, and he is non the wiser. What he needs is knowing what he is looking for, to be able to make any judgment. And whatever this "looking for is" will decide his research's outcome.
My advice to OP is to study decentralisation (if this is important to him) and judge all sources of information by this criteria. And if one source of information is wage or have logical errors in reasoning when it comes to decentralisation, he should cut the source from his consideration.

First of all, some developers contributing to the Bitcoin core project does not think that a block increase is safe at the moment.
Second: If The Bitcoin core project gets known, to be pushed around by powerful actors in the ecosystem, there could not be anymore trust in them. They would destroy their reputation that has bean built for the last 9 to 10 years.
It is just not sensible, for people to promote something they do not believe. It would only loose your reputation. 
EDIT: As a bitcoin developer, your reputation is your ultimate asset. To be held to the moral standards that is necessary to be a trusted developer is beyond me.

This is a mess.
How do you put an idea into practice without first liking it, checking it, asking others to check it and like it, engineer it, check it, like it, get others to check it and like it. Develop it, review it, like it, test it and like it. Then deploy it, not before?
You are confusing the concept of multiple implementations when it comes to Bitcoin. Normally multiple implementations are made to a common specification like tcp/ip, here you can have multiple implementations and they would be able to coexist and make the ecosystem stronger(if there is a bug in one implementation the whole network is not affected), In Bitcoins case Bitcoin core is the specification and any implementation that does not behave the same on the network is a buggy implementation or a fork.
@_date: 2017-03-22 10:03:11

From my understanding 1, is the correct answer, but some externalities changed the optics. Segwit (core solution took a long time) and in the meantime Roger and big blockers felt neglected by the core developers(nobody wanted to write code for him) and (for moderating some of his posts)(he wanted results immediately). He starts his propaganda machine and starts lobbying Chinese miners, literally chasing then down and explaining them about BU, and how bitcoin core will be bad for them in the long run. What Ver is not aware of is that the message some miners hear is that they by supporting BU would gain more power over bitcoin in more ways than Roger ever intended.
So if this goes to far will Roger be able to put the genie back in the bottle?
For your second question. Miners have the possibility to limit the transactions they include in the next block to effectively steer the fee levels, what they can not do is include more transactions than the block limit dictates. 
@_date: 2017-03-20 17:49:31
I totally agree.
@_date: 2017-03-25 18:23:22
I understand this, but if you do not have a verifiable list of the miners, mining in his pool, you can not say anything about this with any kind if certainty.
Occam's razor dictates in Jihan's case, a person who can make machines that makes money. That he will mine, with as much hardware as he can muster, not only on his own pools but on every pool open to take his businesses, not only will he maximise mining power without tipping his hat, he will also mine more efficiently as he gets to know when block are found quicker.
@_date: 2017-03-25 19:53:17


Sure, but developing bitcoin you have to look real hard at worst case scenarios. Best case not so much.
@_date: 2017-03-05 08:56:06


I know that, mining was from the get go intended to be done on commodity hardware, any cpu would do. This was Satoshis "gift" to the community and to himself. Specialised hardware have shifted this commodity mining opportunity(witch is fine for the time). But it is vitally important that bitcoin gets the commodity mining opportunity back.
It is now in Bitmain's powers to give this opportunity back to the community, I am not saying that they should do this without profit necessarily, But if they where not monopolists they would structure their sales differently, so that having a vote would be achievable for every participant, not only to industry miners. This gift could rival and even strengthen satoshis gift, and put Bitmain and Jihan in a totally different light.

The more likely scenario in wake of propper of-chain scaling is that 3rd. parties, such as exchanges make totally trust sucking private consolidation agreements for off-chain transactions between themselves. Tip: Miners will see less fees from such arrangement than Segvit and LN.

Your arguments are used on all sides of political quarrels. People should do better, they did not think of this and that. I like the core model better than any I have seen elsewhere.


I do not agree. Keep the politics inside the core development ecosystem and let them carry on. Rome was not built in a day

Sure, if majority nodes refuse to validate the transaction because of this, miners would not touch it. Surprises me though, if otherwise both transactions are the same.

If you read the core scaling roadmap, you will see that this is in the plans, what is also clear here is that it will not happen til after segvit is activated, to reduce risk.


be enough.  Delivery on relay improvements, segwit fraud proofs, dynamic
block size controls, and other advances in technology will reduce the risk
and therefore controversy around moderate block size increase proposals
(such as 2/4/8 rescaled to respect segwit's increase). Bitcoin will
be able to move forward with these increases when improvements and
understanding render their risks widely acceptable relative to the
risks of not deploying them. In Bitcoin Core we should keep patches
ready to implement them as the need and the will arises, to keep the
basic software engineering from being the limiting factor.

What are you commenting on here exactly, do you just type comments in random places?
Segvit increases capacity, directly and indirectly by providing simpler implementation of of-chain transactions.


By giving them this possibility as BU is currently doing, they gain a whole tot more special power over the network. 
1. they can dictate the cost of my full nodes. 
2. they can pressure smaller miners out of business.
3. they can sett fees much higher than Roger Ver ever wanted. If growth ever declines a bit they could just lower the blocksize and demand higher fees from people that depends on Bitcoin.
etc. etc. etc. It is actually not possible to predict all scenarios this could lead to.

Even though it is far fetched, China as a country could in the future find more utility in bitcoin than any other currency, even if PBOC created their own crypto coin it would most probably be less trusted between nation than Bitcoin. This possibility is also less of a possibility after such a stupid action

I can not speak of the validity of this claim, but in all honesty, why even care if a transaction is "spam" or " legitimate". The transaction is costing money (so spam is not really an issue any-longer, as it was when transactions where "free"), witch are paying our miners.
@_date: 2017-03-05 12:15:07


I off-corse reread the article, I had to know what you where talking about. Because I did not recognise bitcoin mining in what you where claiming.


Calling me a newcomer, is a known suppression technique, and is not very kind in such a discussion. It might not have been intentional, but you would not loose any necessary information in your post if you had omitted it. The word newcomer was not in any description of the article I could find. 
Your understanding of mining is quite god for a laymen, but for a miner who has invested significant amounts of resources into it, I feel it is a bit lax, not to be accurate when describing the mining process.


You do not confirm a transaction one by one, a transaction is considered confirmed when accepted into a block backed by the most pow.
There is no corelation on transaction numbers in a block and the amount of miners(pow) needed in the bitcoin protocol. 
@_date: 2017-03-22 16:57:06
This is a serious!
@_date: 2017-03-26 10:58:47
If a bitcoin developer, develops something that is against his conviction, his reputation tanks.
And with all this talk about market deciding, would a developer, make code for you for free? So that you could make a choice.
If you want a code change that is trusted it Bitcoin. YOU fund the development within the core ecosystem. YOU fund the testing, the code review (to a standard that is acceptable for the ecosystem) and you make damn sure that it is a opt in change, so YOU do not ruin bitcoin for other parties.  
@_date: 2017-03-20 20:01:21
There is no core, this is a big misunderstanding, if you want the loosely coupled group that makes Bitcoin core, you need to follow their protocol. BIP -&gt; discussion -&gt; Action.

It seams like you are trying to make thing difficult for yourself.
1. Why not use a different wallet, it your wallet is giving you grief?
2. Why not hold a bigger amount of fiat in times like this? By changing bigger amounts the fees are not bad at all.
3. Use your prepaid debit-card
4. Do not buy flowers, it is bad for the environment.
When complaining about transaction not being confirmed it is customary to paste the transaction here. Complaining without proof, has no value.

This might be true for a mentally healthy individual, witch leeds us to the actions of the 20% that are not. They also have a say in consensus. 
Then add the part of the population that are psychopaths and sociopaths, found in high percentages in profit and power seeking positions, some are bound to be miners.
Giving miners any more power over bitcoin protocol layer, is hence not wise.
@_date: 2017-03-28 11:01:15
Well In my mind there are som sound logic here, one problem is that it is built on the flawed premise, that miners is the suppler of blockspace. Fact is that the blockspace that is sold is not the miners to sell, if not the nodes that are storing this blockspce forever, agree that the level of blockchain growth is sustainable. If they do not beleve that the growth is sustainable, it means for the wallet/full node operator that it is no more feasible for him to secure his money safely by running a node. There is for the time being no other way for node operators to communicate this to the miners that the blockchain that they support/run but to stop running them.

So if you double the volume and halve the fees, you get more profit?
Simple answer is: NO profit will not change
So if we look at  today it seams that most people are would wish for 20 satoshi pr byte fee, but to be included in the next block a approx 200 satoshi pr byte is necessary.
So if we for the sake of argument assumes that there is 10 mill. users today. First we would need to increase blocksize 10 times to 10MB to get the fees people would like, just to satisfy the users of today with no growth. Then if we wanted to scale for 1000 mill. users we would need to increase block-size by 100 more times to 1GB to keep the fees at 20 satoshi pr byte. Now the miners has increased their profit by 100 compared to today, and by any stretch of the imagination should be happy? No, they wont, because the network utility has increased exponentialy, witch increases the potential value of a transaction exponentialy, witch by market dynamics forces will pressure the fee price to increase. 
No amount of balancing by miners is going to achieve this onchain without hurting decentralisation.
EDIT: And Roger will not be happy!, I realy do not see Roger happy without a functioning 2nd. layer solution. And I want Roger happy, I want everybody in bitcoin happy, hell I want everybody to be happy.

The one transaction verified by most nodes(propagates the network the fastest) will be chosen as the legitimate one by the network, and if enough fees are payed to incentivise the miner finding the next block, he most likely will include it in the block.

Well, I do not consider cost a purely monetary phenomena, doing this is what got our world in a strange illogical place. I consider switching cost any and all causes of friction for a switch.
You are correct that risk, at least in technology is something the human brain is not evolved to assess and needs to be studied to be quantified, but I do believe that most people will feel more at ease having their money in a system that is talked about in mainstream media and that they have had the most exposure to.
You also might want to consider that some of the alt-coins might have properties (anonymous payments etc.) that could make governments uneasy, witch could shift focus from Bitcoin in this regard.

Yes, it is by design, there is supposed to be a backlog. This is so that when all 21M coins has been created the miners will get paid for mining blocks. If there is no backlog nobody would pay fees.
It is also a extremely important milestone of Bitcoin development and testing, to be able to see in reality how the network behaves when under real load.
This is giving valuable information as we speak to the core developers, so that they can optimise the protocol to be more resilient and efficient.

I have been over this in my head a thousand times, and I always end up in the same place:
Any compromise should be done within the core development environment, taking "orders" from outside can only lead to confusion. Many developers have already compromised within the environment when they signed of on the roadmap, and for this to get sidetracked with suggestions coming in from the side, confuses the hell out of the consensus built within core.
An other "problem" with providing 2 pieces of code, is that you legitimise that we have 2 opposing camps witch again leads to politics forever.

I do not blame you for having trouble understanding childish tantrums. Both Jihan Wu and Rogers feelings have been hurt, and they have not been offered a way out to save face.
In my mind, as long as there is utility in bitcoin there will be ample opportunity to make money on fees even if off-chain transactions are made possible. Miners could supplement their incomes by facilitating fee-based off-chain transaction, the same way anyone else has he opportunity to do, I guess they see it as to much hassle, beneath them or have not considered it.
It is my firm belief that Roger Ver and Jihan Wu's incentives for BU is unaligned, they hope to achieve different goals by supporting BU, hence if BU is successful there is a new battle waiting to be fought some time in the future.

What they do and do not do is not the issue, that does not matter when setting the rules. Only what is possible should be considered.
By capping the blocksize now, the miner doing this will probably increase fees in the network, and it would be bad, but they are unable to squeeze other resource constrained node operators off the network, witch in my opinion would be orders of magnitude worse.

Well, I am quite convinced. I recently set up a Full node 0.13.2 at home and it took approx 18 hours to sync and verify. So if the max block size was 8 Mb and the bloks had been full for the time the bitcoin network have been active, the initial syncing and validation would take 35 times longer, nearing a month to get a node up and running.

Should  have an ultrasecure base layer with scaling done at higher layers? Or low fees now even if it risks base layer security?


Reminder: no one has shown that a modest blocksize increase has any downside at all. This oft-repeated dichotomy is false.

They have proven themselves to handle a 10 000 000 + user community, securing between a 15-20bn$ bug bounty for almost 10 years (EDITand handling 1bn$ in transactions every day.) it just escapes me, that some people are not able to fathom the enormous feet this is.

The discussion is about trying to reflect in the client what the actual cost of a transaction is(I guess the intention behind this was to not give users the wrong impression that transactions are free although at the time there where no fee market so in effect one could sign transactions without paying for it).
In the whitepaper he writes


less than its input value, the difference is a transaction fee that is added to the incentive value of
the   block   containing   the   transaction.     Once   a   predetermined   number   of   coins   have   entered
circulation, the incentive can transition entirely to transaction fees and be completely inflation free.
As long as he did not add specifically that some space on the block was reserved for free transactions in the consensus algorithm, he implicitly granted the miners autonomy on the issue.
From this one can deduce that in a free market with unlimited demand for free transactions, there have to be a backlog for the market dynamics to operate and provide security for the network when inflation goes to zero.

Thanks, I have not taken any offence :-), I purely try to promote civility, by pointing out what i find not so. 


What you describe here is a theoretical weakness of the protocol(by design), and could indeed be exploited in a attack by miners or governments taking coercive action against centralised miners. The best mitigation against this vulnerability is to decentralise mining in every possible way, so that no entity could have a noticeable impact on the network.
So this does not explain the need for centralisation as described in your previous post.


I am not saying asics are not great, and the people who have designed and made them available have not done a great job. What I am trying to convey is that when acquiring this power one should think hard how this power influences your investment.
One of the great things about crypto currencies that you do not see in fiat, is that there is a incentive to behave nicely towards people holding less than you, because the majority can at any time switch currency and leave the big holders with worthless tokens, the same goes for miners.
This is what is happening at the moment(it is not my favourite way forward) a minority of people with much power is blocking Bitcoins progress by denying the majority of nodes to activate segwit, this leads to controversy that is not good for a unified Bitcoin.

Thank you, very convincing arguments for protecting decentralisation and even securing light wallets.
I see that these posts was written approx 3 and 12 months ago, have you accounted for the efficiency in initial syncing in 0.14 or have this improvement made any change in your safe average block size estimate of 300kb/s. Have your estimate increased after 0.14?

1. Segvit and other 2nd. layers will get you cash with low fees.
2. It is no good to have Bitcoin if you have to rely on 3rd. party for your wallet. If you can not afford to run a full wallet due to enormous block-chain, a safe wallet would only be for the rich.
3. If you remember the message Satoshi embedded in his first transaction. It was a poke to the existing central banking system(that erodes your wealth, by printing money) that has been destroying the world for a long time. Even if (God forbid) Bitcoin would end up as a settlement layer with big fees, it still will be a system that can keep the current central banking system in check, just by competing.

Yes, I agree. On the surface this claim could seam legit. But only on the surface. It is quite hard to actually make the case that 3-6% of a development team could be considered undue influence and thus constitute centralisation. Even if blockstream funded 100% of Bitcoin core development, it would be equally hard to make that case, that would only imply that the team was doing a great job, and no-one else found it worth wile to contribute.

Some are arguing to remove the block size limit, hence it makes sense to use block size, as this is the effective point of contention. Block size is quite generic and as many other words has been created in the bitcoin space, Blocksize might be the specific name om the Bitcoin block size. Who knows?

If there where just one miner in the network he could do this by himself, without any exterior influences.
If miners in general where faced with economic hardship they would collectively be incentivised to increase fees. And we all know that tasting a bit of the forbidden fruit could lead to collusion between miners.
If BU becomes predominant and mining centralisation becomes worse, it would be easy for them to collude.
When block rewards becomes small in the future it is in all miners interest that fees are big, this means that the incentive is for all miners to control it collectively, they will find the utility cost of one transaction and price it thereafter in competition with other markets. 
I think you have misunderstood "the tragedy of the commons"
Witch individual actors is depleting/spoiling what common good in this situation? There is no common resource in Bitcoin, there is market priced transactions witch costs money to facilitate, there is no free lunch to spoil. Unless you believe that transactions should be free for all times.

I know some are and I have no problem with this, I wish all developers would be funded somehow. And if some feel that their interests are not being considered they should start funding developers. This was actually a big problem earlier, and organisations where criticised for not funding.

Sadly, greed seams to have been the downfall of all human created systems during history. But I do not think that you should be dissuaded of crypto currency just yet. There is one new tool in humanity's toolbox, and it curtsy of crypto currency. The new tool is simply for the majority to drop any currency/POW for a another if big stakeholders does not act with great care and consideration to the greater community.
Just, imagine if the 99% that owns 1% of today's  wealth could pull a trick like that, on the morons that are ruining our world :-)
Do not give up just yet, no one said it would be easy, freedom never is. Just remember to fall on the side of decentralisation whenever an opportunity arises.

Sure, there are some apparent insurance claims, but my guess is that it is limited in scope. (Have not read the fine print, but I assume it is only good for good times)


The market will take care of the specific agreements, but crowdfunding/participation will be a more cost effective way to operate. And the saying "a little of a lot is better than a lot of a little" will carry more weight in a deflationary economy.


If you accept that swarms of people with common interests, where each person contributes what he can/want, often for free or at reduced cost. Makes a more efficient organisation than a traditional organisation where a leader forces one to do stuff one might not even enjoy. Consider also that conventional businesses have a low life expectancy after witch they fail and destroys a lot of value and resources, 9 ot of 10 startups even never lasts a year. This is worse resource management than the Atlantic salmon.   
Combine this with perfect money(Bitcoin) witch increases in real value over time. Lets pick 10% a year. 
Todays banks creates approx 90% of the money they lend with 10% security and they get interests on the whole amount. For a bank to do the same with perfect money they first have to get the 10% and then add 10 times the old interest, to be even with the old system.
I do not see such inefficiencies being a part of the future.


Despite they have a fantastically functioning real local economy, compared to the US witch inflates the stock market, the Japanese has funnelled the printed money to the grassroots economy, witch keeps the wheels turning. I have been fascinated with Japan and wondered how their country can still be so functioning after all these years of economic struggle, and it has somehow made me wonder if current economic theory is as sound as many believe.
PS. Japan has not had perfect money!

No, there is a continuum centralised&lt;--&gt; decentralised, any decision you make will potentially have a impact on where you lie on this continuum. Increasing blocksize --&gt; centralisation.

Problem is, we need it to make sense for the entire ecosystem, you have gotten it quite backwards, what made the Satoshi whitepaper special for me was the genius and careful alignment of incentives. So in my opinion everyone with a shared of power in the bitcoin ecosystem should consider this, what is good for all is good for me.
In a decentralised system the more you give, the more you get.


Here you speak to us, who pays your meals, like we where vermin, and not your peers. What is so wrong in sharing some power to grow and secure the network? I hope that you realise that Bitcoin looses all value the moment it's controls is centralised to a certain point, an by centralisation here I mean also when to much power falls into the hands of one actor category.

Great article, but some issues:


According to the HK agreement and the Bitcoin core scaling road-map. They insist that segvit be activated first, to reap efficiencies gains, and then scale on-chain in a careful way.
Hong Kong agreement : 
Bitcoin scaling road-map: 
Some core developers are not in agreement with this approach and considers growing the blockchain to introduce risk of centralisation. No- one as far as I can see is contesting this fact, but rather how bad the effect of such scaling will be. 
Have a look for your self:


This is written in a way that implies that Blockstream is funding all development of Bitcoin core. Actually Peter Wuille is the only full-time Core contributor. Several other members of the Blockstream team contribute to Core part-time, but there were 517 Github contributors in total in 2016.


EDIT: I do not think of r/bitcoin as a knowledge center, Bitcointalk forum, sure.
Disclaimer: After I saw accusations of moderation in I somehow instinctively started following originaly. I have since come to the following personal realisation.
Talk and discussions regarding solutions have not been actively moderated(some stupid examples do exist, and it is a shame(in my humble opinion)). But advocation for implementations that do not follow the reference client or break consensus is not allowed by forum rules.
On the front page of &gt;Promotion of client software which attempts to alter the Bitcoin protocol without overwhelming consensus is not permitted.
PS. I do not like this rule.

They discover a new block before they have the chance to verify the transactions they want to get in the next block. Instead of risking spending a few moments and verifying some transactions and maybe loosing out they sign the empty block straight away.

The problem with hard fork for me at the moment is not the hard fork itself, but that the hard fork is pressured onto the developer community by some big miners(low mind-share and big power ). If Bitcoin developers gives in to this, their reputation will be damaged to a detriment, it will from the moment they let themselves be pressured, not be possible to trust them to develop Bitcoin to the degree of independence that has been demonstrated to this day.
The miners that are pushing BU at the moment has put both themselves and core developers in a situation that is difficult to come out of without loosing face and reputation. I say that this is the fault of the miners because they have knowingly amassed to much power in the ecosystem, and in this way created unrest in the community. 
So no matter how you look at it, even if one thinks that BU has interesting ideas(I do not!, as long as the ideas is developed outside core community), it should be clear that when a powerful actor, no matter who he is, is threatening the current longest chain, should be considered a dishonest actor.

This is the second time you are telling me that my opinions do not matter. What is so special about you that you get to have all the opinions that matter?


No, not false at all, he has pointed out that the github field that is specifically intended for attribution and providence of code, has been striped of the correct data. From the links in this thread both you and the developer in question has acknowledged this, and for some od reason think that throwing a note in the code about who actually wrote this is ok.
If this developer you are alluding to thinks that it is ok, not to follow best practises when using other peoples code. Even after he is made aware of the situation, and he does not make any effort to correct his mistakes. Why should his reputation not be damaged? That is what reputation is all about.

Consider increasing the onchain blocksize only for coffee, and see what would happen.
How many coffee cups are sold each day in he world?
According to Wikipedia 2 250 000 000 cups where consumed every day in 2002. With 86400 seconds in a day this makes for approx. 26 000 transactions pr second for coffee alone. So assuming best case that bitcoin was only used for coffee and that every transaction used was a basic transaction with one input and two outputs with a size of 250 bytes, the blockchain would be approx 1400 terabyte by the beginning of next year, witch would require 179 8GB drives to be stored. This sounds crazy, is my maths wrong? Just the pure cost of maintaining such a cluster of drives make my head spin. How many drives would fail every month, redundancy? power-consumption? space? cooling? this is data-centre scale storage solutions we are talking about here.
Could even be that we are drinking more coffee now in 2016, than we did in 2002.
These numbers would be better when we consider that many cups of coffee are bought in bulk by people brewing themselves, but compounded by the fact that a lot of transactions is necessary for producing the coffee.
If these numbers are correct, I have a hard time figuring that coffee is even considered for on-chain transactions as a norm.

Bitcoin core is a Open source software project, the way to get code changes into such a project is normally to put in the resources and implement it at the best of your ability and, test, test ,test(scratch your own itch) then do a pull request to let the other developers test and provide comments. Anyone can do this, it is open to all. If the pull-request is found interesting, safe and with a clear and safe way to roll it out, it is almost always implemented. It is not a good idea to try to pressure people to make the code for you for free, if you want it implemented.

But when they are rejected by the people who developed, maintained and deployed a world wide trustless decentralised system that has had practically 100% up-time during the last 8 years. It is quite silly. The only reason that I would stop trusting the engineering capabilities of these 500 diverse set of people. Would be a severe cockup, witch to my knowledge has not happened yet. 
Then, why should I let my confidence sway by some comments, and promises of hundreds of developers that no-one is able to name?
It is not enough to name "the developers of BU", because there could be other incentives to be working on BU than believing that big blocks from a hard fork is the only sane solution at the moment.

You are comparing two different metrics, network decentralization is the foundation that makes Economic decentralization possible in the first place. And if it disappears would not be possible anymore. It is like saying e-mail &gt; internet, of course you can send e-mail some other way, but it is the size and distribution of the internet that gives it utility.

How?, By definition, hardfork is easing consensus rules, while softfork is limiting or staying the same. So if I understand this correctly raising the block limit is an easing of the rules. An easing of the rules is not backwards compatible with existing clients no matter how you do it. If you maintain that this is possible, you should write a bip, and save us all.

I disagree, Bitcoin is successful as log as it provides utility for economic decentralization. The economic decentralization Bitcoin provides is correlated to its success. 
If you think of a old telephone line that can have a quality from 0-100% and that for most people 50% quality would be just sufficient enough to deliver a message(to painful to carry out a social call). Such a line with 50% utility would be extremely easy to disrupt, and other solutions with better utility que up to replace it. A phone-line with closer to 100% quality would be much less likely to be disrupted, only cost or regulation could do this. 


Although centralised exchanges are a part of the Bitcoin ecosystem, I do not view them as relevant in this discussion in the long term, they are only a specific use-case like any other use-case. They are extremely fragile, trust based institutions that are barely, if at all coping with Bitcoins Bull runs, and almost always the source of investor insecurity that pops the "bubble"(Today 11.jan.2016 is a prime example)
My hope for Bitcoin growth is that it grows slow and steady so that all use-cases can grow with it without being fragile.
So :
centralization = fragility -&gt; lower utility


What is your messure for sufficient? In my mind it can not be sufficient enough, it will need to improve constantly to deal with changing times.
@_date: 2017-01-14 13:57:32


I do not know how you can arrive at this conclusion, I see new users and merchants coming into the fold every day? The result of this is that bitcoins are spread on more hands every day. Looks like a healthy growth pattern to me. Could even be a bit slower for my taste!


This is a 100+ years in the future, lets first focus on the next 5 years, or even the 35(Average life of a fiat)


I do not think that the Block size debate is bad, it shows me that it is not easy to change Bitcoin, witch is a good thing.


What is the alternative? If you can give me an example of a beautiful technical solution/invention/product dictated by a business man or entity, I will give you a gold star! Why? because a business man or entity is to concerned with his own self preservation that he is unable to let go and let the technology grow on its own.

BU Red

Some clarification requested by the thread.
As far as I can see BU was initialy forked sometime second half of 2015 and version 1.0 was released in January 2016.
The part of the graph up to the fork is the same on both graphs, namely the activity of the Bitcoin core repo. 
Evidence has been linked in the thread that suggests that attribution information is not preserved properly in the github BU repo. This could be reflected in the graph by giving the impression that BU commits is higher than it is in reality.

I am firmly in favour of Segwit activation as the best short term solution to the scaling issue.
My issue on this thread was simply me noting that calling people names, probably will not help our cause. 
If we wish to convince people that a hard fork and miner controlled blocksize, carries more risk than Segvit, I belive we need to be sensible in the way we explain ourselves. And be kind even if it hurts a bit.
I do not see much name-calling from you, in the few posts I have read(Edit:Exept with me). Keep it up:-)
@_date: 2017-01-29 10:03:45
How?, By definition, hardfork is easing consensus rules, while softfork is limiting or staying the same. So if I understand this correctly raising the block limit is an easing of the rules.

You do realise that what is spent on the lightning network based on segvit is bitcoin.


There is no functional implementation of lightning or any other 2nd layer protocol for Bitcoin without segvit. So you can say that segvit enebles this. I could have used lightning instead of segvit in this context but felt it was limiting of segvits scope. 
PS. I have a sneaky feeling that we do not disagree on the bigger picture here, maybe our issues are coffee related.

By sending total amount(input) associated with the public key, the output is divided amongst outputs where one of the outputs are a address (change address) that you control yourself.

There are also other goods than coffee in the world that would increase this number of transactions.


Well if you do not think this, you are actually setting an arbitrary low limit on all future transactions on the Bitcoin blockchain. And it means in practise that bitcoins can not be a viable way to pay for goods or used for transactions with lower value than a cup of coffee. You should also consider that the most vocal opponent of segvit, is hosting gambling on the blockchain, god only knows how many transaction that industry would require.

So what is your prefered magic number for a blocksize increase, that would satisfy you?
Lightning network is in alfa, and would in my humble opinion be tested and ready by the time the increase made by segvit was exhausted. But as long as people are dragging their feet, this is a fast fading dream. This again means that for some time we will have to accept bigger fees until segvit is adopted.

I agree, this is the reality, we have to recognise that, embrace it and use it. Imagine a new user coming to Bitcoin and becoming aware of the divide in the community. Then when reading both r/btc and r/bitcoin they read the same thing "There's no convincing people who lack the knowledge to actually understand the issues at stake."
One side claiming higher Economic understanding and the other higher engineering understanding. So where does this new user fall on the scale. 
This divide I believe is closed only by winning one hart and one mind at the time, by being attentive, kind, patient while giving answers on the issues at hand.
When someone stops responding or calls someone names they have lost the argument, and it is clear for everyone to see in the posts forever.
I guess pressing for details in a friendly manner seams to be the most effective way to :
Making someone call you names, you have won!
Stop responding, you have won!
Engage in dialog, you have won! (Your arguments are stronger)

You should also consider technical and political motivations for people(miners,users,hodlers,nodes) to choose one chain over the other.
I would not choose to follow a fed chain, or a chain where developers expects to solve scaling exclusively through on-chain bigger blocks. One political and one technical, hence you can not predict the future by only considering the economic benefits for (miners,users,hodlers,nodes).
@_date: 2017-08-13 14:00:01
No, with a private key you can reassign any amount under its control to any other public key. You do this by signing a transaction with your private key that includes the public key of the recipient. The recipient(and the entire Bitcoin network) can verify that the signed transaction is made with the senders private key by using the senders public key.

How many coffee cups are sold each day in he world? 
It would be interesting to see a graph of expected coffee sales ,vs. blockchain size and transactions pr second for the foreseeable future.
According to  [Wikipedia]( 2 250 000 000 cups where consumed every day in 2002. With 86400 seconds in a day this makes for approx. 26 000 transactions pr second for coffee alone. So assuming best case that bitcoin was only used for coffee and that every transaction used was a basic transaction with one input and two outputs with a size of 250 bytes, the blockchain would be approx 1400 terabyte by the beginning of next year, witch would require 179 8GB drives to be stored. This sounds crazy, is my maths wrong? Just the pure cost of maintaining such a cluster of drives make my head spin. How many drives would fail every month, redundancy? power-consumption? space? cooling? this is data-centre scale storage solutions we are talking about here.
Could even be that we are drinking more coffee now in 2016, than we did in 2002.
These numbers would be better when we consider that many cups of coffee are bought in bulk by people brewing themselves, but compounded by the fact that a lot of transactions is necessary for producing the coffee.
If these numbers are correct, I have a hard time figuring that coffee is even considered for on-chain transactions as a norm.

A hard fork with 51% is not a safe way to hard fork, it is an attack. It is possible of course, and legal according to the consensus algorithm, but  I do not know of any such low margin hard forks in the history of Bitcoin. There have historically been agreement between a super majority of miners/users. I will never ever respect a proponent of such risky behaviour.
I know that miners is the ones that makes the final initial decision on this, but it would be unwise to disregard the users signalling from their full nodes. So for a balanced info-graphic there should also be a pie-chart representing them.

Ok, what if we see a new world war, and the internet is severely limited or set back.
We have a saying in Norway that one should not sell the skin until the bear is shot. Eg. work with what you got, and do not make predictions about the future for something that you depend on.
Making a fixed 10% increase a year is analogous to making a long bet on technology against Bitcoin. It is just not sound investor advice in this risk category. Bitcoin is to valuable in my mind to be making bets on its future.
Scaling Bitcoin of-chain at this time and scaling on.chain when the internet resources are available mitigates almost all these risks.

I agree,  the hurt is called growing pains, and it is not only bad, we are learning how the system copes while under real high stress conditions. I can not think of any engineered system of Bitcoins importance that does not depend on such real tests. Bitcoin is not ready, lets not take it out of the oven just yet, it will be better when its done.


It is called planing. It is impossible to meet market demand through on-chain scaling alone, So a plan was made so that the market could have cheeper, faster transactions. 
It seams to me that core has been bending backswords to keep the market happy. But keep in mind that a free market can not be reasoned with, it wants stuff even if its not ready.
PS. the market can not jet code.

Bitcoin is still in development, and you are a early adopter. If you consider the fee estimation dillema witch is being  worked on at the moment(Thanks to high fees), the spamming of the blockchain(Thanks to big blockers). You can see that you have gotten in the crossfier here.
At the moment and probably until lightning wallets are being rolled out on main net or spamming of the blockchain stops. It is equaly rediculous to use a 120 Billion $ network for most 100$ transactions. There are still usecases for 100$ transactions where you would find 25$ fee acceptable.
If this fee came as a supprise to you, I would imagine that Coinsquare did not inform you of the fee at the time you sent the transaction, this is a huge usability improovement on their part.
MY best advice is to studdy the problem and learn how to use Bitcoin cheeply, it is possible but requires the user to be on top of it. 
Segvit transactions are cheeper.
Find wallet where you can control fees yourself.
Check  to judge for yourself what fee should be used at the time.

What your fighting children will learn when not being judged by a sensible adult that listens to both sides and gives his argument on who is wrong(might be both)  is "anything goes"

I agree discussion is normally good, however when bip 64 and bip 101 witch XT mainly consists of, was voted down, and the XT client witch changed the consensus rules witch would lead to a fork, was being run on the main net. At this point XT was no longer a suggestion but a attack on Bitcoin and the way development had been done before, and hence not any longer a Bitcoin implementation that could be discussed on /r/ bitcoin.


I agree it is childish, but in case bip 64 and bip 101 there was a discussion, and it was voted down. You must agree in general at least, that if people keeps discussing the same thing over and over and over, you might not find the discussion interesting after a while, you have to draw the line somewhere, or nothing else would be done in the end.

Sure, and to balance this power we have developers, that when they discover miners that can potentially become a threat to the ecosystem by e.g. gaining to much power, has the possibility to knock them back a bit. If one miner gets to much power, your money is unsecured, so if a miner is not adult enough to limit his power, he could force developers hand and possibly ruin it for other miners that managed their power well.

I do not think it wise to show that ideas are bad not to include them in Bitcoin, they should be proven extremely good to be included or at least better than any other idea available.
The problem arises when a minority is not willing to let things go, when they are down-voted.

Solution in such a setting is preferably a grownup to take the child aside and talk some sense to her, or let him play for him self.

Many of the core developers are not opposed to a safe increase in blocksize, they developed SegWit witch is a genuine blocksize increase. They have also stated in their roadmap that a blocksize increase is likely to happen via hard fork if other more efficient scaling proposals fails to scale enough.


You have to consider that at the time of writing a decentralized consensus network is inefficient, slow and expensive. Buying a cup of coffee on-chain with this system is nothing but squandering a precious resource, ask yourself if it is necessary to store the information of this coffee transaction on the blockchain on more than 100000 computers til the end of time.
The promise of Bitcoin is so much bigger, competing with fiat to stop wild inflation and boom and bust cycles in the economy. It might even end modern warfare as we know it, it might not end all wars but maybe unjust wars witch people are not happy to fund themselves.

In my opinion no, while doing ancestral work you many times need to make changes to old assumptions, so utilizing an expensive storage method to store data would be overkill. 
Ancestral work has in some sense similarities to proof of work witch protects ancestral information. It is the work of documenting sources, the sources is linking relatives and when done right the link is pretty strong by itself. so a database is probably the way to go.

Wether people like the consensus rules or not is of zero consequence wen protecting huge amounts of value, what you are talking about is proof of stake democracy.

Your model has all the same flaws as the eg. American democracy. Would you trust the voters in the last election to protect your wealth?
I do not have a problem with the possibility to fork and replace existing consensus rules, but I am not sitting idly on the sideline while corporate is making this irresponsible power grab without any scientific reason, threatening the security of my funds and future ability of Bitcoin to compete with central banks. 
There is a reason internet users do not make the internet. If the internet should be governed and developed by its users, i doubt that there would be even a pixel originating from the net on my screen at this moment.

When you find the first claime that is sensoring people. Read throug "Community guidelines" on the right on this page. Find their documentation of the sensored post, and determin for yourself if it is sensoring or just moderation of a subreddit according to the rules.

I would love if some actual logical mathematical justification of the opposite was made in support of a BIP, that way propper development practices could be followed. It would also shift the burden of proof to the actual people hwo wants a sertain chainge. 
Stopping an ide without actual logical mathematical justification should not require actual logical mathematical justification, just obective resoning.

What banks deal in gold?, Banks can only create the national fiat currency in the country they are regulated and anointed as creators of debts.


If you found a Bank that would take gold or diamonds and put on your account(I do not think it legal or practical), they could lend out that for some interest. What is fascinating with fiat in a fractional reserve system is that if you deposit 1$ into your bank the bank can lend 10$ and get interest on all 10$. Money being wished into existence.

It might sound scary, but consider this. Jeff Garsik (their only programmer) makes a small change to introduce opt in replay protection, one week later Peter Todd(core) finds a vulnerability in Jeff's code and Jeff is forced to reverse the changes. So to extrapolate: "for every code change Jeff makes, more people are going to loose money, probably in a exponential manner." Now, lets just wait and see the greediest of us come home to mommy crying.

A thought experiment: 
Say you are 100 people and you are hiking in the mountains, the fog comes in and with no navigational aids a discussion develops. 2 people wants to go South and 98 people wants to go North. 3 people in the big group works at Google. 3 years later and after all except the one that "quit", got home safely. The remaining guy from the small fraction and 8 payed employees, still blames Google for not going South.
EDIT: Only one from the small fraction got back.

Banks can create fiat, they can not make bitcoins. They have to mine or buy bitcoins like the rest of us. So if the value of what they can make gets to 0, that is the end.

I agree, but "absolute security" when it comes to producing the code that runs the network is essential. ref. etherium fascinating consent but its developers have chosen to play fast and loose with code, thus tainting their track record. 
I guess we will have to agree to disagree, my money and support will always support the people with the least to profit from changing the narrative or co-opting the network.
You are of-corse correct that a malicious actor in a ethics based meritocracy could do damage, but in contrast a corporation is void of ethics and must be expected to be malicious at all times. This is why it is important to have many developers that can review each-other, any failure to do so will certainly lead to loss of network value and lost credibility in developer and the development team.

If in a strange reality s2x would be more profitable to mine, I would immediately start considering the economic aspect of my miner as a expensive noisy heater.

2. New alts released daly. Hard for people to follow along in the ecosystem. Hard for majority of users to latch on to the same coin.
3. The best developers probably gravitate towards the biggest coin. To work with the best and for fame and fortune.
4. Have a listen to Trace Mayor  for listing of all network effects that bitcoin are enjoying.
5. Bitcoin has an amazing trackrecord, security, apresiation, adoption etc.

I guess that people running multiple nodes behind on ip address is counted as one node. eg. non duplicate
Listening nodes can be reached by other nodes on the network and contributes more to the ecosystem.

For a bingo coin it could be done, I do not want bingo coin.


Control to 100+ developers is not centraliced


read the white paper with this in mind


Development is not the goal of bitcoin, its the ability to use the coin.
Any node running code that is not following the rules degrades the system and makes it under-perform what it is supposed to do. Bitcoin is the current consensus, any act made to change this is an attack by definition. The decentralised development of core is being done on a test net and only by consensus of people that has proven themselves to be able to contribute constructively, are changes made. This is done to keep Bitcoin safe.
@_date: 2017-05-18 19:26:10
The reason for my sentiment/attitude/position is that whatever has been released by core and has been agreed upon by all devs, has been running perfectly and not made me loose value or bitcoin for 7 years. If hat is perceived as being a problem you should probably throw in a few bugs to detract people, until that time I will be running released software and take a wait and see approach. I am certainly open to change my mind at any time though.
@_date: 2017-05-01 19:16:14


Without developers no blockchain systems. No security. No development.


Sure, and most of these users do not have the popper knowledge to assess this. So it is not the best idea to base development/change of a currency on their opinions. Might be a flaw of bitcoin, not a big one as it seams quite resistant to change.

Even running a pruned node you would have to download and verify the blockchain initially. So when listening nodes start to go down around you where do you get access to the entire blockchain for 3 days with ok connection/bandwith?

Increasing the block size is the crudest simplest way possible to scale bitcoin, people in the know has many ideas on how to scale in more clever ways.

The planed improvements also has the potential to make a future block size increase more efficient.

@_date: 2017-07-23 13:32:39
If most nodes reject them, they might not get far enough propagation to even be visible by most nodes. Do not know how they could be reliably detected.
EDIT: A bit quick, most nodes is probably not rejecting at the moment as many nodes run core. I guess they will have some propagation still.

All apps on internet is created with scaling issues initially and improved iteratively. Just throwing hardware resources on an early Facebook scaling problem is just expensive. Clever iterative development is cheeper and more sustainable, then add hardware resources when it makes the most sense.
@_date: 2017-07-26 17:28:37


Quite a black/white view. Rogers problem is that he has no patience for the scaling to be developed while preserving decentralisation, witch is bound to take some time. He wants instant gratification and is willing to sacrifice anything to get his will Now.
How about:
100% decentralisation, 50% utility(settlement) = Now
Work diligently to improve scaling so that:
100% decentralisation, 100% utility(settlement &amp; cash) = As all good things: it is ready when its ready.

This discussion is starting to go round in circles. And I believe I can see where this is going. I presume you have heard all the arguments before, and I can see you are pressing for the abolishment of the current development model with multiple development groups. In addition to a undetermined block size limit and an increase in total bitcoin cap to allow for inflation. THAT is not Bitcoin.  Changing the development model to a never tested and completely unpredictable, is not my idea of wise, at least not on a blockchain 20bn worth.


And it doesn't matter how large the group is if they're capable of telling others what to do and if the group themselves decide who belongs in it. You can't just decide that you're one of them, they do. 
Ya, its better with a president!


It does not anywhere talk about how to agree on the rules. It assumes the users already have agreed on that by another means. 
you answered your own question, with your followup question.


For one, nodes are verifying all transactions, not just the verifiable transactions.


False. Bitcoin is meant to assist mutually untrusting users to agree on a shared history of blocks using mutually agreed upon rules. There's absolutely nothing stopping you from coming to an agreement to use different rules. Who's attacked when nobody's hurt? 
The whole community is hurt, confusion, brand tarnished, development delayed, you name it. I makes a world of hurt.


These are people that still acts as if bitcoin was alfa software, and that there is no reason to be diligent. The discussion has been had, 90% of listening nodes are running core, and you make it seem like more discussion is needed. I can for the life of me not understand that.

As far as I know, sweeping the paper wallet does not use a Bitcoin transaction, it only adds the paper wallet for your sweeping wallet to administer. You would now have 2 private keys in your wallet. Transferring the funds between the accounts would require a Bitcoin transaction and a fee.

Hm.. If 80% of miners collectively collaborates to change bitcoin, that sounds quite centralised to me.
Everybody should mine, cant wait for water heater miners. And standardized commodity mining units.
If we all start mining again with a slight cost to ourselves for protecting our coins, we might make a dent in big miner incentives over time during the coming halvings.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:37:33
around since 2011.
 I stand corrected, of-cause it is possible to loose money in lots of ways. But I think that your calculations are a bit of if you held onto your mined coins. You probably would have been better of if you did not invest in the miners and held on to the BTC you invested. So would I. But the value of the BTC you invested should be denominated in Fiat/USD the moment you cashed them out for the miners in your calculations. Calculating this way I would say you still made money, just not as much as you could have done.
Ever since bitcoins got value, I guess the most profitable thing has always been to by them with Fiat, if I had bought bitcoin instead of investing in gpus I would have had 80 times more. 
For private individuals I guess we should look at mining as a way to secure the network is kept decentralised and that it comes with a cost, but in addition it comes with a lottery system that cold land you some nice profit if lucky, in addition you could always utilize the heat  produced. I do not know why we do not see hot-water systems powered by miners.

From your experience it seams like people are resistant to ideas criticising the system, and that they have issues with businesses and people with money taking advantage of them. One reason for this might be that by criticising the system, they implicitly criticise themselves through their belief and participation in democracy, witch is not an easy thing to do for a human being. I think by externalising the problems and blaming other people, you could find initial common ground for understanding.
1. One effect of the current system is that money/power is concentrating in fewer and fewer hands. witch leads to a boom bust cycle, where the bust part never seams to be powerful enough to redistribute power in any meaningful way for most people.
2. If the former point is true, this means that there is no incentive for money/power to limit itself in the pursuit of wanting more, the stick is not big enough to have any effect.
3. Imagine Bitcoin(or similar) being used, and gradually concentrating in fewer and fewer hands until the level we see today, 1% owns 99%, any major holder would be incentivised to not alienate the 99%, in fear of the 99% rejecting the currency for a new one, effectively voiding the 1%'s accumulated liquid wealth. Now that is a stick worth supporting, and I do not think it challenges the comfy bubble that most seek shelter in.

Very well put, listening to him was not half as bad as all the comments on here told me it should be. His claims are plentiful and a point by point rebuttal would be nice.

Well, it might seam that way while in process of distributing coins, but after the flow of money will reverse. It is also a feature of coins like Bitcoin that if the holders starts misbehaving like the 1% today do, the 99% can render their coins worthless by choosing another. 
In my opinion Bitcoin has the potential to hold wealthy people accountable for their actions.

Consider a safe with 40Bn$ in it that has been standing on times square for the public to attack in any way they can for 8 years without anyone being able to get away with any money, would such a safe have intrinsic value? add to this that the safe could be used by anyone 24/7/365 and that the safe was available anywhere in the world at the same time for anyone to store their money.
You know, the list goes on and on and on and on, virtually no limits is placed on any user of this system.

No, I do not like branding of people. I find that it might entrench people more in camps than fostering individual thought and discussion.

During the summer I will make some profit, come fall I do not know. But as a heat source it will  offset my heating bill. After some time I will experiment a bit with water-cooling and try to prepare for the next generation miner so that I can integrate it with my central heating and hot-water system. Hopefully this would lead to me being able to squeeze every bit of utility out of a miner during its life. 
So if I need to vote or signal some BIP, The family just go take a lot of long hot showers.

When you have spent all the channel funding money, it is in the recipients interest to clear the funds to the bitcoin blockchain, and after that it is in your interest to fund a new channel if you want to spend more with that partner.


LN is only one option to spend Bitcoin in the future, you coose the method that fits your purpous the best. Buying a house, use onchain transaction and LN for coffe etc.
LN is extremely well suited between partners where payments goes both ways, the channel could be settled once a year if properly funded.

My apologies, thank you for pointing it out. Must be confusing it with some other Satoshi comment, can not find that either.
The only comments i find regarding micro-payments is here 
By this time he clearly does not have any solution other than centralisation in datacenters or by computing resources being trivial issues. 
My point is that whatever Satoshi wrote when he was around is not the absolute truth. New problems will continue to be discovered with Bitcoin and new solutions will have to be made to make sure that the ide and problem Satoshi was solving, continues to be solved a long time into the future.

What keeps me optimistic is:
Bitcoin works beutifully as is, in my mind. (Would like Segwit though)
It is hard to change the protocol without consensus.

If you are willing to forgo security and privacy it would be quite easy, but the promise of Bitcoin is to get the best of all worlds.

The normal fee goes to miners Miners, an additional fee can be claimed by the LN nodes that you have to traverse to get to your destination(Not shown in the video) The 10,000,000 is the channel funding witch is locked up for you to spend on LN as long as your channel is open.

Why?, It is no different than transferring some "spending" money to a debit-card account. You are locking the money to be able to spend them on LN, so it makes no sense to me if the end user does not decide how much he wants to spend on a channel or who his channel partners will be.

Bitcoin is inflating every 10 minutes, 12.5 bitcoins are introduced into the bitcoin economy. This inflation will carry on with diminishing effect (halving every 4 years) until approx. year 2140, when bitcoin will be able to act as a deflationary currency as more and more Bitcoins will be lost by people that do not take proper care of their coins.

From my understanding, he is not listening to advice, that is why no-one is helping.
@_date: 2017-06-14 11:06:16
Yes, what is your point?

Litecoin has protected much much lower value, but sure, been tracking Bitcoin development so esentialy the same.
Ripple, do not make me laugh. I threw mine from the giveaway to /dev/null

Nobody is running Segwit2x, it does not exist!

So how do you envision getting money to this app, funding it? 
You could imagine that the app automatically creates a new channel when bitcoin gets transferred to a privet key that the app has been set up with once. This should not be difficult to do and would make the app function as you say. I do not see the point though as transferring bitcoin to this app or funding a LN channel is sort of the same thing, you could do it once a year or whenever your channel is emty. Then use it day to day as you suggest.

If all you want to di is hodl, paperwallets are fine, make backup copies.

Sure, if your goal is purely to make money, that is a nice profit :-)
My wish is to be able to support Bitcoin and hopefully make some profit. Even a small loss wold be acceptable.

Censorship resistance =  The difficulty for any actor to alter, deny, delay a (in bitcoins case) transaction.
Distributed power (not necessarily hashing power)= the ease of witch any actor in the world can connect to and use bitcoin with expected service quality compared to other actors.
So censorship resistance does not say anything about who is able to participate and at which level.

Did you calculate the total cost of one coffee transaction made today accumulated on all full nodes in say 10 years, every transaction on the network keeps using resources indefinitely. So attacking the problem this way you will see that in a global perspective it would be cost effective for the world if coffee would be free instead of being payed for by bitcoin.

Yes, I do not beleve that in general "adoption-first" campers are supporting asicboost as a first principle, rather  halfheartedly supporting a big miner that seams to pull a lot of their weight. 
@_date: 2017-06-13 08:34:19
Thanks for the trip down memory lane :-). Stay gentlemen!
@_date: 2017-06-16 22:37:13
I like your new categorisation(decentraliced/adoption first), I think they are less devicive and more descriptive of the underlying opinions.
@_date: 2017-06-15 12:50:39
I would not speculate short term, I am in it for the long term :-)
@_date: 2017-06-18 07:42:45
I am not sure I understand, I find that decentralisation leads to censorship resistance, without decentralisation I do not see how to achieve censorship resistance.
I do not see a good reason to argue this small point, but I would be interested if you could elaborate further.

Like Cannon-C I have been searching for evidence that supports evil activities by core contributes, all I find is loose comments taken out of context.
It seams to me someone thinks that it is immoral for a core contributor to have private communications on the internet. It is not their privacy they are giving out for free, it is code and project management, Open for all to see. The colour of some core developers  underwear in this regard is uninteresting.

Do you realy not see the problem with asicboost, it is a bug in bitcoin, a security vulnerability. Bitmain has invested a lot of money exploiting this in their hardware. Effectively preventing the malubility fix. 
Cheep electricity is not in danger of holding back bitcoin development and has no impact on bitcoin code whatsoever. Asicboost has is holding back development.

10% Is Viktory in my book, I am just guessing now but i do not think that the current % of bitcoin holders wold register as a fraction of 0,01 % at the moment

I have not have time to read the whole thread regarding the potential risks, but it seams to me that most of them is debunked in some way(some with stronger arguments than others I must say)
What is your takeaway, witch are the most important risks witch are left standing?
@_date: 2017-06-24 19:11:02
I do not think "more transactions" is descriptive of why people want bigger blocks at this time. It is not a productive goal l in its own right and does not answer why?
@_date: 2017-06-07 12:10:59
To me it seams that good Bitcoin content are up-voted, regardless of the source. It should be no different in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-06-11 10:16:41
It also discusses 2nd. layer transaction. And with 2nd. layer transactions coffee purchases are entirely possible.
The problem is that the developers are not being able to work and experiment with these solutions in an efficient and practical manner until segvit is activated.
When faced with new information not awailable at the time the whitepaper was written, it is in my opinion wise to reassess. 
It is the same as hiking and following a preplanned track, if you encounter a cliff, you reassess your route. You do not go over the cliff if you are not prepared because your route was planed that way.
