I have not heard of bitwage before but it does look promising since it does not require the employer to sign onto it. It does lose some of the privacy BTC to BTC payments offer but I think I will try to use this for Uber which is not my full time job but can let me test it out. Thank you.

I buy with cash from an ATM, I just scan wy QR code, put the bills in and leave. There are security cameras inth location so in theory someone could track me walking around, visiting the ATM, then track me back to my car and run my plates to find me. But there is no account or database whre my info is stored like on coinbase or an exchange.

I think it HAS happened a lot because the 100 coins were maybe worth $1.00 at the time they lost it. I would not be suprised if people lost small amounts in the future but I think enough people who have their private keys now know to keep them secure so we will not be seeing millions of dollars worth lost in landfills.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:10:35
Bitcoin has a fixed supply, while the expansion of available coins is slowing, it will never go negative so it is not deflationary. Relative to USD, BTC seems deflationary because USD will inflate forever.

You may be well intentioned but this 100% sounds like a scam.
@_date: 2019-07-14 21:35:09
Currently inflation is about 2% which means the USD loses 2% of the purchasing power so as long as no more than 2% of bitcoin is lost each year it will be more stable than USD. Not perfect, but better and free from govt monopoly.

I am not in Bitcoin for monthly income, I am in it now for generational income. I will hodl for 30+ years if I have to, or hodl till bitcoin litterally hits $0. Only exception is a personal emergency, but with my other USD savings and income, if I need my bitcoin money I have larger concerns than trendines in my life.
@_date: 2019-07-15 03:57:46
I agree, but will bitcoin suffer? I do not think so since it is a long time and many lost wallets before a single satoshi is worth so much it cannot be used as currency, and bitcoin could be split into more decimal places to accommodate.  Another possible outcome is a satoshi is like a hundred or thousand dollar bill and another crypto or even a bitcoin fork is used for transactions.
@_date: 2019-07-15 21:58:27
The second one is better as in Deflation is better? I think deflation is better too but the smaller percent is more important. So even if people lose their bitcoin at 0.1% each year, that deflation is more stable than the 2% USD inflation.

The more restaurants that menufy can sign up the better. I have been going to this place over the last couple years and it is exciting to see they at least partnered with a service that accepts BTC.

@_date: 2019-07-15 03:37:43
You are probably right, I do not know exactly how much has been lost but I imagine the remaining BTC will just go up in value more to make up the difference and people will be more careful. There could always be another crypto if all the bitcoin just gets lost in the next 20 years.

Bitcoin is also infinitely divisible so it will be able to reflect the total amount of goods and services in the world. Currency is only as valuable as the goods and services that it can be exchanged for so even if there are 20 million BTC instead of 21, the remaining will expand to encompass the difference.
Also, at the point bitcoin is the world currency, I do not expect people to lose it, just think of how much you have lost this year, 95% of the time I use a card to pay, and I get paid in direct deposit so the odds of me losing money is very low. 
Regarding estates upon death, even if the currency is not passed down, it will likely be a trivial amount. Imagine how much the US Economy would suffer if a million dollars happened to go up in flames, the multi trillion dollar economy would not notice. Even a billion dollars would be a rounding error today, even less on the world stage if BTC is accepted globally.

Do you have a wallet? I use an atm frequently and I scan my QR code first, then I put in my money. Once I hit"Confirm" on the ATM, the bitcoins in about 1-4 hours show up on my phone due to the ATM setting the transaction fee speed which I am fine with it being kinda slow.
PS I use Jaxx as my wallet, its a free app.

@_date: 2019-07-14 11:34:34
I do not think people losing their wallets will matter if Bitcoin is used on a global scale. If you are smart and hardworking enough to have a million USD, you will likely have safeguards against losing your money. Even if a million or billion USD get lost each year, it is almost a rounding area considering how large the GDP is.
@_date: 2019-07-30 19:23:02
Did you send them USD or BTC? If USD just contact your bank and cancel the transaction, even if there are fees even $100 is worth getting your money back.

Personally, I use Jaxx which supports over a dozen cryptocurrencies and allows you to have access to your private keys which means it is much more secure than an exchange. Any individual exchange can be hacked and the coins can be sent anywhere while your hardware wallet (i.e. Jaxx on your phone) unless someone physically has access to your device. See website below for details.
@_date: 2019-07-14 11:41:01

Right now BTC is too volatily for me, assuming the salary is a constant 0.5 each month the USD i need to pay rent. Taking an effective 30% in a month if BTC goes down is too much risk even though it could go up the same 30%. I buy bitcoin every month and am as big a beleiver that BTC will be in the millions and a major world currency, but I cannot enjoy it if I am homeless and cannot afford food if it crashes again.
@_date: 2019-07-20 21:19:56
You can use a site like this, 
Current Principal $4,400
Annual Addition $0
Years to Grow 200
Interest Rate 3.6%
I got just under 5.2 million
To calculate"Real Return" you have to factor out inflation so the real return is less than that, but to get 5 mil over 200 years you need about 3.6% on average.
@_date: 2019-07-14 20:41:08
I thought more can be added if needed? If not then if BTC is at $10million 1 SAT is worth $10? Maybe another crypto will be used for smaller denominations.

In the financial world, if anyone could predict anything they would literally have infinite money because if bitcoin is crashing, they would short it with every dollar and loan they could find and come out a multi-billionaire. Nobody actually knows, it could crash below $10k. Regarding hacking, if someone could hack it right now according to  it'll be worth $200 BILLION dollars. When it was 1 billion or even a million it would be worth it to hack, but the fact that it hasn't been able to be hacked because it is unhackable proves the theory works.

If you don't want to lose money buy a stock, BTC could go to 0 much faster than a company like apple or Google. For your financial future, a boring old IRA will be a better use of the several thousand dollars 1 BTC costs. BTC has always been a long game for me, and if you need a CC and worry about the price, you probably shouldn't buy it based on the stress. If you won't stress then you wouldn't be asking the question you did.

Ive been buying off and on since below $3000 years ago, bought some more at just under $13,000 recently but thats the highest I ever bought. I may have lost money on that single purchase but overall I cannot really lose above $7,000. I used about $200 of bitcoin when it was worth about $19,000 me which was bought for about $50 over a year earlier. Play the long game, government currency always goes to zero and even if bitcoin goes to zero, I would rather lose fighting for bitcoin than eventually lose trusting governments.

Jaxx Liberty has no age or account. If you have a 12 word key you can enter the words directly, or the app will give you a new wallet.
If you want an exchange or place to buy crypto with credit/debit you can try localbitcoins but I dont know if they have an age requirement. All the places I used to buy BTC online are banned in my state or do not service USA.

If you write your seed down on a piece of paper, that paper can be seized, if it's on your notes in your phone, the phone can be seized, etc. If you store your BTC on coin base, coinbase can go offline tomorrow and youd have no way to get your BTC, or if coinbase is hacked, the hackers can take your BTC.

What do you mean $1saoshi is not convenient? The smallest currency now is one penny so if that is the price of a satoshi then that is $1million per coin which is still almost moon compared to the price today.

I brought that up with someone but they said something about a consensus had to be reached to fork the chain or something which is unlikely to happen. But if a satoshi is at the point where it is too big to be used, maybe $1=1 satoshi? Then bitcoin is at 100 million dollars and we all gained 10,000x and we are at moon already.

From what I understand, it is still anonymous when you spend it as a new a ID is generated when you spend it. To spend with a credit or debit card you need a bank account which needs various ID as well. The only easier thing than bitcoin/card is cash, but you have to get paid in cash to spen cash. If you withdraw cash from a bank, well that bank has all your info and ID on file anyways.

You are right about about bitcoin not being the crypto that makes it big which is a whole other area of debate. I just hope that it can be seen coming but if not, I am right in buying crypto but my coin ends up worthless anyways, the worst of both worlds. I have heard cryptos be compared to the dot com bubble, where the internet(crypto) is a major part of our world, but finding the few companies(coins) that will make it is the real challenge.
Thank you for the complement, you are a true scholar and a gentleman on the internet.
