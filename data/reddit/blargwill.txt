As another user has pointed out, a heads up game between two people would remove this problem; my understanding is that like with the problems faced by the bitcoin community, everything has to be open to inspection and can't be judged without centralization, very hard when people want comforts provided by a central authority. Maybe the problem you raised will be inevitable? A load of people on the internet have tried to solve the problem but used pseudo authority to solve it in one way or another. Interesting point!

I would love to see how you can automate accepting bitcoins, automatically taking the bitcoins from the indervidual address you provided and adding it to a hot 'wallet', like LocalBitcoin or any of the betting sites

Make it a 'too' and I'll subscribe ;)

Well that sure is a reassurance! That was the vein I was thinking actually, I wrote out a [mental poker]( arrangement a while back but got stuck on the game's pot and how it would be managed as a group without tampering but just wrote out some specification tonight..
The glory of it (which I haven't found anywhere else as a casual bitcoin gambler), was the lack of a house edge that was purely focused on the game. If it ever does come to fruition I think it could have some potential as a substitute for all these 'current gen' website.
I'll be sure to post more as it progresses if there is interest!
Thanks for such a detailed response :3

I would really appropriate that! It's cool to see someone else making this transition, send me a PM?

Yes. This quote!

Thank you very much for that link, that helped a lot to give perspective and hinted at their inner workings enough for me to start thinking for myself again. Muchos Gracias Redditor :3

Exactly my opinion! As much as I love the likes of satoshibet and sealswithclubs for their platform, I think that knowing you're completely alone on your table without any kind of supervisor definitely has its appeals..

My heart sank momentarily thinking that someone had beat me to release a mental poker app. Few! Fingers crossed for the next couple of months.
But this looks epic!

But I heard you'll just forget everything once they're done with you?

Hopfully coming close! I hope to have something to show the community within the next month or two. I have implemented Mental Poker to deal with the provably fair shuffle/deal and multisig addresses for people to play on their own without having to trust others. There is no central server and you connect to other players directly. Here's a screenshot of progress!

But I love it.

Wow, that was an increadible post! by the term I was refering to the possible combinations, but from your explination the subset is still astronomically (pardon the crappy pun) large that it wouldn't be an issue.

Forgive me for potentially misunderstanding you but aren't you decreasing your key pool?
@_date: 2015-02-19 22:43:02
It was beautifully laid out. That was a loss.
