I watched a presentation by him a few weeks ago and I have to admit he did a fantastic job explaining the inportance of bitcoin and blockchain in general. I'm now gonna subscribe to his channel!

As far as I know, that's not really true of renewables. You can't turn off wind or the sun. And even if you can cover the solar panels or turn off the wind turbines, that energy is still being wasted.

It's different. It's like saying that science relies on faith, implying it's on the same level as faith in a deity. It's not the same, and it's different enough so as to not be very meaningful to call it faith.
I don't understand the math behind elliptic curve digital signatures or the secure hashing algorithm, but I atleast understand the way the protocol of bitcoin works on a surface level using abstractions to understand how both algorithms work. That is enough to be able to tell that there is **no** faith in Satoshi. I understand putting trust in many diferent experts that do understand the math and the code because the protocol is much more than the surface level understanding an average user might have, but it isn't "faith". For example, I don't have faith in scientist about global warming in a manner similar to having faith in a deity or religion. I consider that a lot of other people who have studied the subject for years and know much more than I do have independently verified the findings about global warming and climate change and that a global level conspiracy would be so highly unlikely that it's not worth shedding a single drop of sweat over it. It isn't just putting faith in this one guy Satoshi that what he created works and ending the story there.
Even though most bitcoin users in the future might never really know how it works and just use it, it's gonna be more than just faith in Satoshi in a way that might imply 'blind faith' like religion. Something similar to the example I gave will happen.

They don't matter for consensus, which is ehat we are talking about. By and large the scie tific community ends up agreeing.
And the point that I was trying to make is that calling "doing what you think it'll do" "faith" is bad taste, since the word has more menaing attached to it. That why enphasised the "like a deity or religion", because that's what somebody might understand by reading just faith. You can apply your definitiom of faith to the whole example of the scientific community and climate change and it works, but it's dishonest when faith is usually used as "believing something regardless of any evidence". And your last point doesn't show that faith is a useful tool (not the usual definition of fsith that is to say). That's what I didn't understand. Those are better described as educated guesses.

Yes, but it's what was implied by your comment. I felt it was important for everyone else that read it to not asume that bitcoin relies in any way in faith in satoshi or even the protocol using the usual definition of faith.

The thing about bitcoin is you can verify it works by looking at the protocol. Satoshi doesn't matter and there is no trust or faith in him unless you don't understand what makes bitcoin special. If anything, you are trusting the math behind encryption.

Think very large scale, like scientific community. A few bad 'scientists' don't matter. And I don't get your last point regarding this faith discussion, sorry.

As far as I know, it isn't really open source. The source code is available but it is still proprietary. You can view and read the code but not modify and or redistribute it.

No, because that doesn't mean that he said that it will happen, rather that such information is irrelevant to the post.

Interesting. Hadn't heard about this.

I don't understand why it is important that the phone must not go flat, or more precisely, that the phone doesn't ask you for the passcode rather than the fingerprint. They wouldn't have been able to access it regardless.
