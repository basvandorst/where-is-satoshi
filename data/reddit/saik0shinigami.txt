If you use a proper encryption such as AES256(+whatever variant you want) yes, it will become "random data" to any person who doesn't posses the encryption keys/password. There's no feasible way you can look at an encrypted container and see the data inside as being anything legible unless you decrypt it. That's the whole point of encryption. No file interpreter can figure out what the hell the file is. Oh and also, you said 


Which is wrong. You can open most .jpg's and other photo formats as a text file and see the header data that tells you all sorts of information such as EXIF data which is a good hint that the file is actually a file that should be opened in an image viewer. Where an encrypted container that is opened with a notepad will not show any identifying information at all. It will look like a garbage file that has no apparent use.
[Here's a random jpg I have on my computer.]( You can see real data on just the first few lines. "Exif" "Samsung SCH-I545" "I545VRUAME7" Googling any of those model numbers will tell you that's a phone which has a camera and EXIF is photo data... You know from the text that this is a picture. The kicker is, even pictures that didn't come from a camera still has identifiers such as [this random wallpaper from the internet]( Don't believe me? See that filename in the picture? Google that and open it yourself(first result in google images which should link you to a reddit thread with an imgur link.)

Okay, let me link you to an encrypted container containing a text file... Then you go ahead and find an interpreter that can let you read it. 
@_date: 2016-08-27 13:36:56
So you've failed to understand the point 3 times now and then blow off the challenge because you know I'm right. 


Because I pulled out one example of a .JPG which is the format we were discussing by the way, you assume my whole library is .JPG also. This makes you a fool.


So then you admit that you're wrong and that I was right. Since you want to backtrack your own argument that you can just use .JPG since it "needs" an interpreter to open the file.


Doesn't matter what the amount is, you couldn't complete the task anyway. 


Stripping metadata doesn't take away the characteristics that you see in the files anyway. You will always be able to identify it as a photo because they ALWAYS have clear-text information in the beginning since that's how the file format works.

Dumb shit like this is why I closed my Paypal account(and by extension eBay) a while ago. They limited me once and that was all I needed to close my account. Worst part was, the only incoming funds to my Paypal account were from eBay sales. You figure they would have their shit together since they were owned by the same people at the time.
I don't know this Youtuber, but I feel his pain. Hope he gets a positive result back soon. Paypal need to feel some legal heat for the dumb shit they do. They want to act like a bank and be treated like a bank but never be held to the same standards as a bank.

But you don't need to, just have to know the timing of the music and to mark the cues to the actual musicians (how to run a division properly).

What's the problem with that? Skepticism is okay. Most business-people don't know shit about how their business runs when you get to the nitty-gritty. You hire the people who do. Orchestration from the top has no impact if you have good business sense.
Do you think that the boss of every business in the world knows how all the tech, accounting, legal, etc... for every position in the company? That's silly and pointless. Delegation is a thing and until we see how they act in the position we cannot make a determination that they will make poor decisions while in the position.
This falls into the "context and scope" I mentioned before. If the head of the department is an amazing head their individual beliefs shouldn't matter. Time will tell.

I would say the retraction of TPP, retraction of ACA, the regulation freeze, and hiring freeze are all very positive and very require actions to take. You can have your own stance on the abortion, immigration, and pipeline issues. But I for one only truly disagree with one thing he's signed so far, but rather than bitching and moaning about it I'll wait for real information to come out so I can be informed before I go bat-shit crazy on reddit about something I know nothing about.
It's standard process to freeze everything when you take over so you can have your people review everything before shit goes into effect under your name. All the freeze shit is NORMAL. This sensationalized crap about it being to hide information is bullshit.
So I implore you... tell me how he's done so many things wrong, but this time with real sources like the text in the executive order itself, or a statement from someone who's studied the order itself. No buzzfeed or other "media" outlets.

This doesn't include the regular routing or cabling on both sides of the wireless link. You only need the first table for a link as long as mine, the second table is just to manage it more effectively and allows me to bring power conveniently closer to the dish.
I take in a signal from my upstream site, then send off the main portion of bandwidth off to my router in my house. I also have a decently large property. So I have an Omni antenna to feed all of that and potentially a couple neighbors if I wanted to make back some money. This whole thing, if you package it into a commercial business is called a WISP, a Wireless ISP. You may have one near you that you don't know about. I can use any Ubiquiti LiteBeam, or NanoBeam antennas to connect back to my Omni antenna from anywhere on my property up to something like 12km away. 
If I got a closer point of service, I could get up to 500mbps aggregate bandwidth which would I would split into 375/125 mbps down/up. Normally I get something like 120-150 mbps aggregate. On really good days I can break into the 300mbps (weather can change your signal strength).

Because it's not income until it's sold. And even if that's where the income comes from... that's not an income that affects the lay worker.


I can't explain something that I don't see happening... or even believe to be happening. I believe it to be a myth and have not seen sufficient evidence to say otherwise.


Bullshit. My family of 4 lives off of significantly less than that and we live perfectly in middle class conditions. I even just purchased a $270k house on our current income. We don't even need 1/3rd of what you claim is required "just to live".


can't make this comparison because middle class 50 years ago didn't have multiple cars, cellphones, telephones, internet, or any number of other large value services. If you want to compare people living now compared to how people lived 50 years ago you'll find that we're all basically upper class comparatively.

The bigger dishes have a removable feed horn(the pokey bit in the center of the antenna dish), you can pull that out and sit a scope right over the hole and aim that way. I've heard of people using laser sights, but you gotta be careful with that one, flag an aircraft and you go to jail. 
Another really common way it to map the link onto something like google earth, and use the line the map makes to see if there's anything that you can use nearby to lineup on as reference. For instance, when I map my link, the link just barely clips the edge of the building(as seen from above, my link is above the roof) across the street. So I can get my horizontal alignment from that. And since you have google earth up, you can pull up the elevation on each location and use math to calculate the vertical alignment (yay, SAS triangle solver!)
Honestly I've done enough of it now that I can kinda just stick my tongue out just the right way and get close enough to get a link, then you watch the status page and walk it into the best signal strength. You get about 2 degrees of leeway that you'll get signal in, but you need to get deadcenter on the apex of the signal to get best results, so you're going to walk into it regardless of which method you use to get basic alignment.
Linus from linustechtips [did a video recently]( on it. You can see they kinda just winged it... but the signal mirror thing, that's super real and I've used that before as I still have a signal mirror from when I was in the military. In this video they're not using an AF5X, they're using a smaller brother of it. The same radio I use for my omni-antenna, which isn't really the right radio for long range stuff which is why they are only doing 12 km.

Yes lower the income of one person in the company so that the rest can receive $1 more! Fuck the guy that orchestrates and puts the whole damn thing together! Forget the fact that they probably lost millions at the start of the company in order to create jobs for idiots like you who just want to strip them of their wealth.
Currently Bezos is the top on the net worth leaderboard... But here's an interesting article for you... 
Fucking $82000 salary. But "take his salary from him!" we hear from the rooftops. Go get a job dude. Go look at how real functioning companies work. If a CEO is taking income they probably(Not always! but definitely more often than not. Otherwise the company isn't a successful one.) deserve every fucking cent of it if not more. They've already given up tons of money to give jobs to others.
$82000 split among the estimate [700,000 amazon workers]( You want to lose Bezo's leading skills in order to give everyone ~11 cents of a pay raise. You're delusional if you think he'll stick around... and even more delusional if you think the company can continue without a CEO. Or even one taking such low salary.

His stock options are worth tons... but that's not his income. Isn't what he's bringing home and certainly isn't what's in his bank account. If he tried to liquidate all that value at once... he'd be worth a fraction and Amazon would likely tank instantly.


Check your article... It says 361, then sources a huffpo article that states 204, later also stated 354 in the same huffpo article. With no source... No data. The 354 figure comes from AFL-CIO, but the link is dead... So that source... IMO is bunk. 
Going out of my way to track down my own sources shows this site from the same source that huffpo claimed...  
 which claims 287  
Where you can access  to see the individual companies as well.
While 287 is still high... I'm not sure it really is. Discovery, Inc shows as the highest pay with a "1,511 times more than media employee pay" as well(they count stock/options in this which I disagree with wholeheartedly). 3 million dollar salary for a company with 9000 employees. That's only a 12.82$ payraise per bi-weekly pay-period if you took every penny from the CEO. A 16 cent raise per hour I believe? You think that 16 cents makes or breaks a "fair" laborers salary?


And yet you act like this is endemic to all businesses in america... that all CEOs do this.  guy in the US doesn't do it... and the vast majority of others don't either. You fundamentally missed exactly how much taking a CEOs money away from them and giving it to the workers actually affects them... It's fucking bunk. Nothing. It doesn't help anybody. 
Do I agree with it? No. I never paid myself out that much out of my own company either. But I'll be damned if I let shitty unresearched and unreasoned articles from huffpo make the calls here.
edit: BTW discovery... CEO salary is 3 million... average work is 85,704. This is 35x multiplier. not the claimed 1511
Edit2: Figured out how to see the "worst" company... apparently it's "gap inc". Claims a 3566 pay ratio with a median pay of 5,831. The CEO Arthur Peck takes home 1,526,442 in salary. Which is in reality a 261 ratio... but even if you took his salary away it would only net $11 a year per employee as I find it reported that there is 135,000 employees. EVEN IF YOU TOOK ALL HIS STOCK AND OPTIONS it would only net $154 a year per employee. Something is fishy about the numbers that are being reported on AFL-CIO site...
@_date: 2019-08-09 05:27:41
I've made a couple of edits to show that even the "worst" offender stripping the CEO of money makes no difference. You can be mad that they make 200 times more than the typical employee... but the reality is that stripping the money from them and giving it to the worker doesn't really help much.

Then you don't need to set your lower end to "rural america" Most rural areas in american get sub 20 mbps download. You're beating many suburban areas by a landslide. I live about an hour and a half outside of phoenix. Many of the areas INSIDE phoenix metro area are sub 100 mbps download. Very little of the area overall is able to get 200 mbps+ let alone gbps...

Yes, bandwidth is purchased at a different location. I found that it's easiest to find a business that can get good bandwidth and buy a second line with what provider their using, then rent some roof space.

I use special equipment, Line of Sight, and the Wi-Fi standard to get internet ~36 miles away. If you can do it depends on the regulatory bodies that govern your area. FCC allows all US citizens to use this technology on [900mhz, 2.4Ghz, 5Ghz, 24ghz and 60Ghz spectrums]( that says Amateur in this chart).
Using equipment like Ubiquiti's AF5X you can use one of those bands and "shoot" wireless many miles. It works much the same way your wireless work in your house, but to get that distance you just focus the beam using a dish, much like a satellite system does, except it doesn't have to go all the way out into space so it ends up being much much faster, and much much less lag.
Edit: I wrote up a bit more for another guy [here]( I'll answer any questions you have... but it's all specific use case, my link is ~36 miles so I use much heftier equipment than say you might need.

I know you're expecting a shit number... But think of all the equipment that has to regenerate or redirect the signal over that same 36 miles on a cable-based network... I only have my one link. My link adds at worst 2 ms (in normal situations) to my ping (measured with a multitude of tools). The same cable-based network across the same distance would be considerably worse. Fiber... if done right, I obviously can't compete with... but I'm not paying fiber prices.
Right now, my ping on RB6:Siege is 9-32ms(  and I'm willing to bet that 5-25ms of it is what I would get if I plugged my computer in at the upstream router. Don't get me wrong though... some days it goes to shit and I'm in the 100's ms if it's super rainy or something like that. It's wireless after all.
