I thought that's what I did, but trying again now, thanks!

OK, followed those directions adapted for ElectrumCash and it seemed to work/this makes sense because I need 2 of 3 keys/I knew that was basically how the 2FA was working...  and I was able to create a new multisig wallet with my 2 private keys and the public key that (I assume) belongs to trustedcoin...  that wallet shows correct balance, but similar error trying a test send there....

Thanks so much!  Downloaded newer Electrum client (should have thought to try that anyway), so far no love but that thread is exactly what I was looking for before I gave up and posted here!  I knew i couldn't have been the only one!

OK, yeah, I did that again, disabled 2FA (this time it didn't ask for 2FA signature, so I guess on previous one I said yes to 2FA) and now I get a very similar but slightly different error, script evaluated without error but finished with false/empty top stack element:

Hmm, I didn't think of trying that!  Which is funny, because I did extract them from electron cash....  let me try and report back, thanks!

by the way, thank you so much for taking this much time to help me!  I really appreciate it!

for posterity: resolved via 2.9.3 Electron Cash and explicit use of MultiSig export/reimport via wallet without any encryption via this thread

Hmm, when I export from Electrum the private keys look the same as when exported from Electron Cash....  I can export master public key or a list of private keys, but when I import the private key from address that shows all my BCC, the new wallet doesn't show a balance...   do I need to export the master private key somehow?  I don't see that anywhere.

Well, that's what I tried doing and got the error I posted on imgur above, though it DID require a google auth code that I set up from trustedcoin...  and maybe I'm wrong and trustedcoin does support BCC (or is it BCH?  Whatever)?
Here's a pair of images, first one from wallet just made by importing private keys:
And here's one from my electrum cash wallet that gives error posted in first post when I try and send to an address (the address I used was just another in the set of addresses in this same list, as a test transaction)
So I'm doing something wrong I guess, or else it's like I said and the private keys I have aren't enough locally because of the trustedcoin involvement, but my understanding is that if I use the initial seed words there's a way to create a new wallet from scratch with the same addresses that doesn't rely on trustedcoin, but when I try and do that I think it just hangs, so I assume I'm doing something wrong there.

Thanks   I know the difference, and I wasn't exactly surprised the keys were the same, but wasn't totally sure given that one of the wallets was set up with trustedcoin integration and one wasnt whether that would effect the private keys/what was present on this machine vs only present with trustedcoin.
The exports happen in CSV or JSON, pairing addresses with private keys, and I see the address that shows my entire BCC balance (in BTC its empty, or empty but for dust, already transferred back to coinbase).  But when I import just the key (or just every private key from export) into a new wallet, it doesn't show a balance the same way the first BCC wallet does, and the addresses it shows are all different, some of them in red.  I took screenshots I can link to, but dunno if that'd be useful.  Just seems like there's something small I'm not getting :-)
