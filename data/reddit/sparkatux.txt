Oh, you mean you are hoping to be in the top 1% when Bitcoin reaches 1 million $.
Good luck :)

Wow laser cut ? You're a pro.

@_date: 2019-12-07 15:23:58
A 100 trillion Zimbabwe dollar bill would have been even better.

Looks like you just doxed yourself though

I definitely don't hope anyone will try to kidnap you, but I would just avoid sharing personal info online.
You seem to have about 1k usd worth between USD &amp; BTC. It's not much today but some addicts would kill for a lot less.

I upvoted it a second time on your behalf, can someone return me the favor ? /s
@_date: 2019-05-20 03:25:51
I definitely don't want my teammates to wear a BCH hat lol,

You are not very clever to show your name and balance in a public post.
@_date: 2019-05-11 14:18:33
I sold my USD a long time ago.

In 10 years :
Nocoiner : Hey man, what are you up to this weekend ?
BTCHodler : I'm going to the spend the weekend on the moon with my wife !
Nocoiner : Oh, ok, let's grab a beer next weekend then ?
BTCHodler : For sure !

I would prefer my adversary to wear a Bcash cap :p

Mixing coins is the best way to get some dirty coins back.

Hey Kid, you should put those 50 euros in Bitcoin, hold it on a piece paper, make sure you never lose it, and learn how to be patient, it could be very rewarding one day.
What are you gonna waste your 50 euros for ? a video game ? a pair of shoes ? a Tinder date ?
Perhaps those 50 euros worth of Bitcoin today might pay for your student debt in 10 or 15 years.

They are sure not bragging about this on r/btc
They are too busy comparing Bitcoin and Bcash transaction fees.
