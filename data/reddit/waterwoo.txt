Most McDonalds/Tim Hortons will accept it fyi, just at an awful exchange rate.

Everyone knows in investing something that worked once will always work.  It's 101 stuff.

What's wrong with my logic. I didn't say developers working on something makes it more likely to fail, I said it is less of a guarantee of success than even past performance, which was already not a guarantee. 
By the way, you don't actual counter an argument by just saying 'nice logic'. Try explaining what is wrong with it.

What's that disclaimer you always here? Past performance is no indication of future results?

Just because hundreds of developers work on something is even less of a guarantee it will succeed. 10,000 worked at Nokia and BlackBerry. Quite a few at MySpace too which also had first mover advantage.

I didn't cherry pick one example, I gave 3 prominent ones if you want to be pedantic, and can give dozens more. 
Yahoo? Kodak? Lehman brothers?
Number of people working on something doesn't mean much if they aren't well managed and working in the right direction.  When you have disagreeing incompatible forks I wouldn't exactly call that some grand unified team work.
I'm not spreading FUD, you are spreading irrational exuberance.

So to make sure I have this straight, the reasons bitcoin is slower and more expensive than other options is because it is so popular, but as it gets a lot more popular (which it must to remotely justify these values) suddenly those issues will reverse?

Yeah but you know also most of those 'poor' people are no longer literally starving or sending their 5 year olds to work. 
I'm not saying wealth inequality doesn't exist but that in no way disproves my point.

Is there, just maybe, some advantages to an inflationary monetary system? Surely there's a reason every major economy has switched off of the gold standard and yet the world as a whole is richer than ever.

Sure but sometimes problems are inherent. 
If some city had major congestion problems when it was relatively small, hoping it would clear right up by the time it triples in size isn't a great plan.

Disagree all you want, the fact that the average human is living a longer, safer and more comfortable life now than ever before is an empirical fact.
But anyway we are getting off topic. All I asked was, is there any possible advantages to inflationary money given that all developed countries have switched to it.
