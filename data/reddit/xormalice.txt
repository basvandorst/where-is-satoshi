How long does it take to "time out"? Will my wallet be smart enough to figure that out, or will it keep retransmitting every 30 minutes, without ever being able to go through?  
I'm not looking for a hardware solution, just an open source full node that runs on Linux.  The moment I go away from the core stuff I feel I need to read endlessly up on what the thing is, who did it, what new risks there are, etc.

I don't really know how long that will take though.  I have reasonably little faith in transactions with inadequate fees, and I am worried (perhaps needlessly) that if it takes too long bittrex will fail to understand the incoming transaction.  Maybe that's just a silly concern though.  
I'm not sure what the story is on Segwit, I don't follow this all that closely.  I don't think bitcoin-qt supports that yet because Reasons.  If you can suggest an open source wallet that is a full node and I can get it up on Linux, I'd be open to try that though.

There's a bunch of conflicting statements from people in that thread.  Without more technical knowledge about what my wallet is actually doing (is it actually recreating the transaction constantly?  How do I make it stop?  Do I then need to wait 72 hours?) or some step-by-step, I don't want to go messing around with that.  
This seems to be a reasonably common question, I'm surprised there's no reasonably common workaround.

There was speculation that regulations or laws would be requested, or that the status quo would otherwise be changed.  The status of cryptocurrency as an asset, not a currency, has not changed, nor has anything changed regarding capital gains.  I don't think anyone was expecting that those would change?
