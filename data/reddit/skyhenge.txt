Lol right?  Cmon, can't you see how selfless he is?  It's not like he felt compelled to start his own thread about buying bitcoin or anything.

Do people on this subreddit realize how completely crazy and stupid most of the people in this subreddit come across at?  Good luck getting mainstream adoption when one of the more popular communities/website for BTC information has very little actual reasonable discussion.
Why is it that seemingly everyone is so focused on price manipulation by whales as the reason why the price has been coming down?  Although by nature, this currency is EASILY manipulated, the most likely reason for me seems to be the cold shoulder that the public has turned to BTC.  Back in December, everyone and their grandmas bought into BTC because they saw it's meteoric rise and equated it to fast and easy money.  Now that the idea of the easy money train is gone, I think the general public realizes that BTC is nowhere close to mass adoption, and in it's current form, will never be viable for anything resembling mass adoption.

I think you're spot on.  Every time I see some, "I'm doing all I can to help!  I can't invest any more this week!  YOU NEED TO BUY AND HOLDKDKDKDLD!"  or something to that effect, I can't help but feel their desperation because the sub-$1,000 they have "invested" is all the money they have.

Your logic is atrocious.  If your argument is going to be whales own most of the coins and whales only want a higher price, then how do you explain the tanking of value?  Jesus.  You're part of the crazy and stupid I mentioned.

Bitcoin is a complete sham.  If you're reasonable and objective you'd figure it out by now.  There's no long term future for it's current use and there's nothing on the horizon that would indicate a solution to this problem.  The only reason to purchase bitcoin is as a speculative currency and hopefully make a few bucks out of it, but even those days are probably gone since more people are realizing there's no future for bitcoin.

*Not to mention cryptocurrencies give many people in unstable countries the ability to control their own economy, rather than their government control it for them. That alone, once it catches on, will be enough to send crypto to unimaginable heights.*
This is ridiculous.  This is why the blind crypto followers will never get any traction for the public; because of ridiculously stupid comments like these that have no merit or basis.  Stop pretending like you know because you don't.  Stop pretending like people in "unstable countries" will flock to buy bitcoin and considering their likely situation, would even make any sort of financial impact on pricing.  Btc is a TERRIBLE currency and the idea of it being a more stable than even the worst government is laughable at best.  And you know what you get without government regulations (I know it's the core of crypto)?  Easily manipulated pricing like of which we are seeing.  Imagine someone basically at any time telling you, hey your $100, me and my friends have determined it's worth $70 now.  Crypto never had been and will likely never be a sustainable form of currency.

Literally what you said, then say I'm using it as a straw man argument.  Then proceed to say this nonsense:
*So call my notions “foolish” and “ridiculous” if you want, but just remember that literally every genius and innovator in history was called that at some point by the vapid and the forgotten masses.
The irony is real.  I'm not going to bother with you any longer.  This is why reasonable debate can't be had here because some y'all are delusional as fuck.

sunken cost fallacy.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:58:23
Except your goober ass felt the need to message a week old message that has nothing to do with prices.  Holy shit what a goober.
@_date: 2018-02-15 23:15:03
Sunken cost fallacy has nothing to do with actual price, goober.

You have that opportunity.  Just live off the grid and don't use any government services like... you know... roads.
@_date: 2013-05-10 04:22:34
Are you okay?

Sorry this is going sound like I'm hating, but I guess I'm too dense to understand.  It'll be cool to hear your response.
When you say no serious security, does that mean the bank's security is bad?  Are all online banking something we shouldn't trust?
What do you mean its not in a free market?  That it has no competitors?  Aren't there a lot of other banks?  I guess theoretically, Paypal is a competitor when you're sending friends money.
Chase Quickpay is free though.  I don't get charged for it at all for sending or receiving.  You might have to hold a certain amount in a checking account possibly?  Someone could correct me on this.
Wouldn't you say it's easier to figure out how to receive money from a bank as opposed to having an BTC wallet?  Both would require registration if you haven't had an account previously, I suppose.
Quickpay is pretty instant it seems.  I can send and my friend can receive money in their account instantly.
I still don't see the difference really....
