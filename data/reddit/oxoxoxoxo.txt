I don't want to be the one to break this to you, but this is the wild Wild West. You really did say it yourself, and to put it kindly, "you're out of luck",
I would say the best thing you can get out of it now is to write it off as a capital loss on your taxes. At least it will save you money there. So it's not all bad I guess. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:44:23
That is not true AT ALL.
If your in a good neighborhood and the housing market is going up because other similar homes have sold for higher prices, then your house will go up in price regardless of the karaoke bar next door. Also Asian people love karaoke, it might actually be worth more!
Demand is measured by transactions, I don't know why that's hard to understand.

The network protocol should be efficient enough to incentivize decentralization through affordable or distegardable-cost nodes. If every iPhone can easily be a node, then you don't have to worry about people paying to keep the network running.
The people who benefit from a free and decentralized financial system should not feel burdened with network fees. Part of the problem is the insane costs to run the BTC network. The protocol is not efficient, which results in high costs for the network. That's not an effective financial system to build the future on.

I mean, you kinda said it yourself... 
@_date: 2019-02-12 17:18:46
I never said the network is free. I said requiring a fee to pay money is ridiculous.

You put your house on the market for $300,000 and two buyers both want it, one offers you $310,000 so you take the higher offer. Now the house across the street becomes worth more. Likewise if you put your house on he market for $300,000 and nobody buys it until the price drops to $280,000 then the comparable house across the street drops in price. The house across the street does not change in value until a similar house is sold for more. 


That's literally exactly what it means. It is the value at the time of that transaction. Of course this value changes based on demand and how much people are willing to pay, but the only way to measure that is through exchange. 
I don't have time to argue nonsensical hypotheticals. If you don't understand how market prices are determined, I can't help you out. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:49:14


Dude, the price they pay IS determining the value. This is obviously not going anywhere, have a good day bud. 
@_date: 2019-02-12 19:00:47
It's not different. That's the problem. 
That's the ENTIRE point I was making, so thank you. 
@_date: 2019-02-11 01:57:22
Oh I see, you're a "companies control us all" type of guy 
@_date: 2019-02-10 19:16:00
You don't have a house to exchange anymore, there is no potential value. 
So tell me, how does the price of BTC magically climb without a transaction occurring? 
You are 100% wrong, dude. Why argue? The price of BTC is determined 100% by the last exchanged value. Not some "estimated demand". 
It is a 1:1 value based off the last exchange. Go ahead and try it, it's not that hard. Go to your favorite exchange, and look at the price of BTC. You will notice the price does not change until an EXCHANGE takes place. The price becomes whatever the last agreed exchange was. Nearly identical to a house. Your house doesn't go up I. value until comparable homes are exchanged for said value. The theorized "demand" has nothing to do with it. The only thing that matters is the last value of exchange. 
If somebody pays $1,000,000 for a BTC, then for a short moment the value of BTC is $1,000,000.  If the next highest purchase goes back down to $3,000 then THAT becomes the price. It has nothing to do with theoretical demand, it has everything to do with measurable demand - measures by EXCHANGE.

But that's not true. You're saying it as a "regardless" but there is a solution that doesn't make it "regardless". 
If the protocol is efficient enough, then the network can be run on nodes with disregard able cost. Think a penny or two a month to run a node, that supports a network which offers zero fees. We're not allowed to discuss here but PM me if you want details, there are networks approaching this reality. 
I don't want to pay any fees! That's the point. If I hand you a dollar bill, do you expect fees to be incurred? Of course not. It should be the same way on a network. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 20:07:24
Someone is willing to pay $310,000.
But you don't know that until the exchange occurs. 
Again, demand is nothing without exchange. It is the single entity which we use to measure demand. You're putting the carriage in front of the horse. 
@_date: 2019-02-01 04:13:54
The application is the same, the observation is defined accurately. The math does not change regardless of how it expressed. The "math" is constant. The "expression" changes. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 21:28:58
\&gt; Because I want to buy it there is demand and you can assign a value to the item.
Okay then, I'll play along. What's the value?

Did you get Firano'd? 
@_date: 2019-02-07 20:09:33
You obviously don't know your bitcoin history. The network HAS gone down before, do some research kid. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 07:14:55
This is nonsensical horse radish.
How would the price rise without an exchange?
"Increased demand" means nothing without a price point reference. Increased demand at $.01 BTC means nothing if no seller will exchange for less than $1000 BTC.
Exchange is the only way we are able to measure demand. Come on, now. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 18:10:08
Your house does not become more valuable without other houses being exchanged for higher value. Without the exchange, there is no proof of demand. I don't see how this could be perceived any other way.

Pay money to send my own money?
This is the one thing with BTC that is bothersome. 
If I send my friend 1 BTC, and he buys something else for 1 BTC, and so on and so forth, eventually all of the money is just funneled into the hands of the miners.
Do that 1,000 times and 1 BTC is now .99 BTC. Do it 100,000 times and it's not .9 BTC or whatever.
That doesn't seem like a good system for financial exchange. 
It should not be required to pay money, just to pay money! That is ridiculous. 
@_date: 2019-02-10 22:16:25
It's not important to answer it? Or it's not possible to answer without the exchange actually occurring? Don't you see the flaw? I understand your point, it just doesn't matter one bit until the transaction takes place. That is how value is determined. 
@_date: 2019-02-07 22:26:04
Not true at all. DYOR

I'm proof. I'm an artist. 8 years ago I would have scoffed at the idea. Today I will gladly accept crypto.
