A ticket was raised to solicit discussion. It has solicited discussion. What's your point?

If you're not making mistakes in life you're doing it wrong. Live and learn, then bounce back.

That makes sense, and would surely have an affect. Perhaps my bullish case is a bit unlikely, but imagine if people [realised this stuff]( I'd speculate that many of the people who occupied wall street understood this stuff very well, but this was poorly reported on by the media, so the message was lost.
The governments and banking system have relied on people being ignorant about how things work, and not having a viable alternative.
They now have an alternative, but I think most people are still largely ignorant.
One more crash like the one which gave birth to Bitcoin might be the event which propels it to widespread adoption. Not directly, but by educating the masses about how Central Banking was designed to eat their lunch.

Why are you telling us; shouldn't you be facebooking an "I TOLD YOU SO DUMBARSES" captioned photo of you in a bath of money, smoking an $80 cigar?

Many deleted things can be undeleted. Google it.

If the next crash occurs due to central banks printing too much money or some other incumbent monetary policy, then I see Bitcoin going up. I guess we'll see :)

Users of a system can't be relied on to use that system in a secure way. Systems should aim to be "secure by default". 
Computers and phones are not secure, which is fundamental issue for Bitcoin that is very hard to fix, but I agree with u/Pink-Fish call that more could be done.

What app does that?
