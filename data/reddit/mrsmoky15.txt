It's starting to dip into the 14k's. Still not bad.

Pretty sure BTC trading was made illegal in China recently. BTC hasnt disappeared, but the larger trading sites are gone. At least, that's what I've heard, but I don't know much about the situation.

Money is also worth Bitcoin, dude

I'm not sure it's over. During the crash a couple weeks ago, it'd start going up for awhile, but then it would just fall more after a few hours. We'll see what happens.

Lots of people have already started moving from physical cards to using apps like Apple and Android pay. There's no reason a model like that couldn't work for Bitcoin in the long run, but it'd probably take awhile.

"Real life money" 
Please read the Newcomers sticky or leave

Just people with a lot of Bitcoin cash trying to get money from suckers. Ignore it. Not that I'm saying anything bad about BCH in general, I don't know enough about it, just don't have that be the reason you're interested in it.

We're still in the very early stages of BTC. The hope is that BTC will hold it's value well over the long term, gaining value over time relative to a currency that is effected by inflation, such as USD. In the future, it hopefully won't be as volatile.

Buy some mutual funds then. Nobody can say 100% what's going to happen with Bitcoin right now, only what we believe, and when one person is saying it'll be worth $0 and another says $1,000,000, you can only really trust what you think.

Stop begging people on Reddit for free financial advice
@_date: 2017-11-06 23:53:32
That's a pretty standard practice. Do you not have some way to see charges made on your card?
@_date: 2017-11-03 06:47:56
For most users. Have you seen the number of idiots not reading any of the information on here and making posts just begging for someone to get them Bitcoin?

LTC is also doing fire right now

Usually takes me that long

Felt that way when I bought at $5500 and it dropped to $5000.
@_date: 2017-10-27 05:45:34
Pretty sure 2019 looks more like 42000

Some dude one day will be on here saying "kicking myself for not buying at 5600". Just enjoy the ride my dude.

Don't worry, it'll be reposted tomorrow, and then the repost today won't seem as bad
@_date: 2017-10-20 15:56:39
What if the sun explodes? Not only will Bitcoin drop to 0, you'll be friggin dead.
