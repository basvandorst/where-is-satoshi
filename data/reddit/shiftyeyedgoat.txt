If someone doesn't like the practice of said company, it behooves him to stop using the process and then to spread the message. I was considering MultiBit HD until I saw this post and it has affected my perception negatively; I will be using an alternative that does not engage in such practices.

The difference between renting and buying is that over long periods (meaning decades), you build equity in the "bought" house versus purchasing the right to exclusive shelter via renting. The problem with buying is that you pay the interest first, which is why banks always win.

What's the matter with improving marketing strategy? Bitcoins are highly inaccessible to the layperson; increasing awareness is step one, though increasing usability is a very close-behind step two.

Seeing as there is a large nascent market of e-paying for purchases (see: Google Wallet, Apple Pay), I would say there is a significant portion of space for Bitcoin to fill. Keeping Bitcoin in beta forever simply undermines its importance and raising both awareness and marketability will allow for the technology to grow to critical mass.

Breadwallet doesn't have a BTC -&gt; dollar exchange or credit card backing; this removes the anonymity wrt US banks, but it also completely negates the convenience.

Hell, bitcoin might even be easily transferred using ApplePay systems given its encryption, easy hand-off, and ease of switching between currencies.

You believe in a strong, authoritarian state that is able to redistribute wealth via tax collection and welfare distribution while also enforcing powerful regulation on its legal framework. The former is directly antithetical to [free-market capitalism]( and the latter offensively contradictory to [social anarchy]( These would fall under the broad umbrella of libertarianism (small L), while your beliefs are vastly more suited for state authoritarian systems.

"It is new and therefore unpredictable and bad."
While this may follow the technical definition of "[Store of value]( it certainly is an archaic version of pedantry. If they want to be consistent, they'd have to put the entire tech sector into the volatility camp.

That's a fair philosophy; do you subscribe to the notion that time _exists_ for BTC to flourish? At some point, governmental control will be attempted (if it isn't already occurring). If there is no relatively simple transition for the oppressed populace, the concept itself will wither on the vine. This, of course, is equally as beneficial to government control as would direct regulation.


You aren't wrong; this should be priority one, or at least within the most urgent and pressing concerns.


At risk of confusing metaphors, it seems like we're closing the barn door after the horse got out. There needs to be a pressing desire for adoption to the common man, and the common man needs to be able to adopt. This, as you say, requires time, but again, time is a luxury.


Assuming inflationary growth can and will build a bubble that will pop. This has happened and will again. How much will the market tolerate before it condemns BTC as vaporware?

If you want a widespread, pragmatically useful, robust currency, then yes. Yes, one does.
Thinking of BTC as a stock is silly; it requires BTC to be rooted to fiat rather than free to be exchanged of its own merits via extensible channels.

At critical mass the community should be able to withstand barrages of pathogenic influx; with a combined user effort (buying into reddiquette), steering the direction of communities (quality moderation), and outlets for silliness, trollery and other aberrant behavior, everything should be robust to the point of bending but not breaking. 
In theory, anyway.

Coming from a subreddit whose sole existence is to discuss and promote the concept decentralized, anonymous currencies over fiat, this is rather ironic.

Don't pretend like BTC is immune to market volatility, not to mention the sunk cost of renting anyway. 
Renting vs a mortgage are generally fairly similar for the abode, the question is whether you want any possibility for a return as opposed to absolutely nothing other than the pleasure of living there.

Ok not to go all conspiracy theorist on you, but in a case of outright federal agent and investigative corruption, convicted and admitted extortion, _none of that careless behavior smacks of immense framing to you_? Not to mention that any and all mention of attempted killing for hire was struck from testimony and charges dropped, despite this plethora of “evidence”, says anything? 
He may not have been an oblivious angel, but the entire situation from start to finish is so poorly handled it is an outright disservice to society to allow a conviction to stand. 
Edit: We just gonna agree to disagree; I don't trust police investigative forces in America and you do. Good for you, citizen; now pick up that can.
@_date: 2018-11-14 00:36:38
Everything about [the investigation]( and [indictments]( [the trial]( and especially [the conviction]( were a travesty of injustice. Oh, and that's not at all to mention that [the judge presiding over the case left back to her old cushy law firm]( after a couple years of separation from the case for "personal reasons". Right.
At very best, it was a complete botch job the whole way through, and the jury was still too fucking stupid to understand it. Get fucked, corrupt American judicial system.

Thank you for the explanation; the technical aspects portion seems like a nightmare for basic transactions. To use a more general example, I imagine it as going to a sandwich shop, completing the transaction, then deciding you prefer some chips. This is two distinct transactions in a short period of time between the same two parties. Would this cause the same technical hurdle? Why does an altered first transaction take the place of two erstwhile disparate distinct transactions? 
Returning to the above example, if the BTC value has been reduced from John Doe's wallet, but has not been placed into the hands of the intended recipient, where does it go? Is it essentially dead coin?
If you have additional literature to these limitations, please send it my way.

I've hopped on and off bitcoin at every wrong time there ever was, the most recent was selling BTC at 200$ a couple years ago all except for some small coinbase wallet with 10$ in it. I've owned 20 BTC that were worth a pizza, and I've owned 1/20th of a bitcoin that is worth 10 pizzas.

What I want to see is what your cash-out will do to the market; we're meant to hoard the currency, not spend it.. ever. These folks going fiat and buying cars will kill BTC permanently. 
Or the bubble will continue to expand, I don't know; it's confusing and hard. :(
