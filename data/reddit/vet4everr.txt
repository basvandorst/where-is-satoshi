@_date: 2019-03-31 11:21:17

@_date: 2019-03-02 22:27:18

@_date: 2019-02-23 20:03:44
whats the difference 3,5k or 2,5k srsly?
@_date: 2019-02-23 20:03:54
downside is limited 
@_date: 2019-06-01 10:37:48
gold will always have constant selling pressure , miners ALWAYS need to sell, thus constant downpressure is guaranteed. bitcoin is very different . im long term bearish on gold , just my 2 cents
