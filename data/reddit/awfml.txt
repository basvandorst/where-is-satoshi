Would anyone be interested in something like this? I personally wanted to see something like it added to coinbase. I always forget what prices I bought some of my coins at, and I keep having to check back to a spreadsheet to see how my overall investment is doing compared to the current market price.

You linked this thread in another one I was reading. Would you mind clarifying? So let's say a user buys one bitcoin at a rate from earlier this week when coinbase got overloaded. I think it was like $600. Is it going to purchase you as much BTC as $600 will get you as of Friday morning? Or is it deducting the price of one bitcoin (whatever that might be, what if it shoots up to like $1500) from your account as of Friday morning?
OR is it reserving a bitcoin for you, at the original price, and giving it to you when it receives the money?

Definitely a lot of confusion. Not sure how it works either. I also bought during that period and I'm not sure what's going on. Apparently they have more bitcoins to sell now that can be bought instantly?

Please ban the memes, I like to come here for serious discussion, not circlejerk.

Some people have been asking whether or not their price is locked in though. Like mine still reports the price per coin in the transaction history. So does that indicate the latter?

I'm locked into mine as well, doesn't look like I can cancel. Guess I'll complete my first purchase and learn a lesson about buying at a future price.

Did you cancel your original order and lock in a new price? Wondering if I should do that as well....
