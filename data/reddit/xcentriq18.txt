If you are not trading actively i would recommend keeping your funds on a wallet for which you control your keys.
When i say ‘control your keys’ i mean that  private key for your wallet should be known to you ONLY. 
When you keep funds on an exchange you are always exposed to the risk of hacking. If the exchange gets hacked(which happens often) you lose your coins. Read about Mt. gox hack

Your coins will always belong to a unique private key. That means you can either have coins on coinbase OR in a different wallet.

I am from atlanta and have purchased btc via coinbase. They verified account in a day or so. It has nothing to do with Georgia specifically.
@_date: 2017-08-20 05:06:27
I hear you man. I am one of them. Won fucking 4 dollars tonight (smh)
@_date: 2017-08-13 20:21:25
On coinbase you can setup recurring payments but like others mentioned the i d be paying more transaction fees with $10/day in comparison to $100/10 days

I am on app too. Okay there is what you should do:
1. Open app
2. Select your bitcoin position from the list
3. You will see four tabs on top - details,book,alerts and holdings. Select fourth option

Or if your finances permit, don’t sell in exchange of currency. Wait for bitcoin to become the new currency

Whats stopping me to move bitcoins to my already existing paper wallet after 1st august?
@_date: 2017-07-25 12:31:41
Thank you for a sincere response man. Really appreciate it. 
Idk why its so hard for some people here to provide a genuine response instead of being a wannabe comedian
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:16:34
Ummm okay. Then congrats on doubling your money :-)
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:13:27
I think you are fine buying with bank account and receiving after 1st as long as you don't care about bcc. I bought today via bank account and i ll receive them on 1st
@_date: 2017-07-22 17:07:01
Go to coinbase.com and add you bank account info to buy btc, eth ot ltc. Pm me if you have any questions
@_date: 2017-07-25 17:42:18
When purchasing using a debit card or credit card you get the coins instantly but if you purchase via bank transfer it takes approx 7 days to deliver

How it can depress bitcoin price when most of us are talking about selling their bcash and buying btc or alt
@_date: 2017-07-18 22:37:17
Blockfolio is what i use.
@_date: 2017-07-25 13:10:45
You should try gemini. Although verification may take a couple of days and just a limit of $500 daily
@_date: 2017-07-25 18:53:13
Pay taxes. Its not worth the hassle and paranoia. 
@_date: 2017-07-20 16:08:39
Lets just assume for a second that split happens and you get to spend it on two forks. Say you have 1 btc and you spent 0.5 one one chain, now you have 0.5 btc left. Then you spent rest on second chain. So i don't see how you doubled money. 
i am new to this stuff but i am pretty sure money is not gonna double in case of a split, on the otherside bitcoin might lose half of its value and hence half of your money.
