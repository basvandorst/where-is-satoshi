you can see your notifications by clicking on your profile picture , but I think you create a game with 10 player and 0.0005 btc as bet price , 
for now in your game they are only 5 players , 
if you wanna I can fund you account with 0.0005 , but do not spend all the amount in one game
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:53:47

@_date: 2014-12-16 21:56:55
you can spend the amount you want, but we just offer a small bounty to help us for debugging, and yes some peoples joined the game and they don't want spend their entire balance . we are making some changes to make this  more interesting 
@_date: 2014-12-09 13:03:41
yep , it's true , we will need to fix some bug , for now is a better tester , many thaks for the feedback
@_date: 2014-12-14 21:47:35

@_date: 2014-12-09 13:16:53
well it's a basic idea of gambling game , we will add more feature , if you any suggestion we take it
@_date: 2014-09-27 17:42:06
meanwhile, banks  take fees with or without credit cards
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:23:30
everything is in the closed game, for each game you can click on the link and you get a modal with all information , player seed, server seed , score and you can test this by your self
@_date: 2014-09-27 21:02:39
I think only UK no fees for bank account
@_date: 2015-01-30 11:03:06
and how do you explain provably fair means  ?
@_date: 2015-01-08 16:38:54
heuuuuuuuuuuu.... nope , we use btc adress and password or fb connect , we have some action that need to have account , 
- first each user have an avatar 
- each user need to have account to perform action like widthrawl or creating a game 
- also we have email notification that can be setup by user 
 
please take a look before saying this kind of things 
@_date: 2015-01-01 23:27:03
you can take a look before saying that...
@_date: 2015-04-08 11:36:08
check out the Bitcoin Fortune [chrome extension]( and receive notification about your bets 
@_date: 2015-03-13 17:21:56
Well you have to play in provably fair games
@_date: 2015-03-28 20:38:31
Server seed and player seed are tow random string , and personally I do not have the time to play against players , I'm the operator ;) and if you have any question feel free to ask 
@_date: 2015-02-04 23:28:48
I've build 2 project based on bitcoin html5-ninja.com and bitcoin-fortune.com , to build a web site you need to have some skills , html5, css3, javascript etc... for front and for the back php or other server side language also for database mysql, mongodb etc...
About bitcoin integration my advice to use blockcain.info api it s free, you can send or recive btc and you can create wallet for your users. Feel free to ask .
