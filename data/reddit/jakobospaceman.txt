A lot of people are complaining about bitinstant, and BTC-E just took all of my money. My advice would be to not use those services. Bitfloor and MtGox are both good tools. It also seems to be a good idea to buy when you think the market has reached the bottom of a valley and just hold your btc until sufficiently wealthy.

No, I didn't get it sorted out, but I have done business with other sites without any issues. Bitfloor and CampBX are what I use now.
If it is a conspiracy, I've been duped. I really doubt it though.

Sorry to respond to an old comment, but how did you do that? They are still holding $1000 of mine and won't respond to e-mails.

100% The address it was sent to isn't similar, and my account at BTC-E shows it was sent to me, while blockchain.info says otherwise

I haven't used the chat box. Thanks for the troubleshooting help. Upvote for you

I lost all my money yesterday. BTC-E stole it. I have proof too, for the interested.
@_date: 2013-04-09 22:32:37
hmmm.... Do you not trust BTC-E's support either?

Please be very careful. Btc-e stole all of my money the day before the crash. Make sure you send a test transaction first so you know that the path is clear.

* [The transfer I initiated (this is to another address I have)](
* [The transfer they actually made (I don't own this address)](

I'm seeing a lot of things like this in Bitcoin. I made a post about BTC-E making all of my money disappear just a few minutes ago. It makes me worried about bitcoin even though I would like it to succeed. How can you use something, if you will just end up losing thousands?

Bitfloor is probably the in the top three on getting bitcoins. I have used it for a while and have started also using dwolla to send money to Camp BX. Neither site has done me wrong and the arbitrage is fun.

I'm not sure if this helps at all, but btc-e itself appears to be stealing funds. Proof:
* [My btc-e address](
* [The transfer I initiated (this is to another address I have)](
* [The transfer they actually made (I don't own this address)](

I'm sorry you're having to deal with this. What do you think your next level of action might be? I'm considering getting a little louder about my issues as well.

People don't want to sell to you for one of two reasons.
1. They don't trust you enough to send bitcoins your way when you could reverse the Paypal transaction.
2. They don't think you will trust them enough to let the transaction clear before you get the coins.
I can sell you a bitcoins, but you would have to trust that you will get them.
If not, use localbitcoins.com

That's how mine vanished. I was doing a btc transfer to bitfloor. I'm not an expert in anti hacking, but a test transaction is a useful tool.
