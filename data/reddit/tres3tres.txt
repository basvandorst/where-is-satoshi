Hasn't it been *literally right around the corner* (what does that even mean as a litteral statement, anyway?) for over a year?  Furthermore, there's a second part of LN which is user/merchant implementation, and that has a decent ramp up period in of itself.
So, no, I doubt this title is accurate.

I'm observing what's taken place so far, and what lies ahead.  I'm never saying LN isn't worthwhile, or won't make it to full adoption...  simply saying it's **not** "literally right around the corner" and that people who claim "FUD" are creating strawman arguments and yelling the sky is falling.
@_date: 2018-01-09 15:07:17
Why you asking me?  The only points I made were:
*  It's not "literally right around the corner" and
* Fewer people are spreading FUD because they're scared it's "literally right around the corner" than the title attempts to imply.
If you actually read my statement, I am saying it is taking longer than "6 months" (because it's a massive design/implementation/improvement) and we shouldn't believe otherwise.

It's not a lie if someone is asking a question.
It's not a shill unless someone is promoting something.
LN has been talked about so much that there's a meme for it now (" soon^tm ").
What the fuck does "right around the corner" even mean, you dummy?
I hope LN arrives, but it's not "literally right around the corner" no matter how much you lie to the contrary.  Like I said, after it's "ready", it still has a hurdle of mass adoption.

Their website has more info but, in my experience, Localbitcoins provides an escrow between the buyer and seller, in which the bitcoin is securely held and then released after both parties confirm a successful transaction.  There are many options for transaction: in person, bank transfer, cash by mail, debit card, etc, etc

This is exactly why crypto caught on (among other reasons).  So that people can hold custody of their own financial independence, and not be subjected to unfair taxation and unfair wealth distribution.

This is sobering.  Mike Novogratz is a billionaire macro-trading mogal, so when he speaks about the market it's worth a listen.  He was super bullish on crypto just 1-2 months ago; said he had ~30% of his net worth in crypto positions.  This news segment states he's cancelled his crypto hedge fund plans AND is selling some of his positions to take profits.  I wonder how much?  He called crypto "the largest bubble in our lifetimes".  Ouch!  Doesn't like the "market conditions" due to so much fraud and speculation.

These sound like you opinions, but you type them like they're settled facts.  In my opinion, if someone is sharp enough to figure out crypto in general, they're sharp enough to notice and understand the difference between BTC and BCH.
Sure, in certain echo chambers, full of confirmation bias, *everyone* thinks BCH too hard to distinguish from BCH, but I'd challenge them to find some real world individuals who organically got confused as is the claim.
