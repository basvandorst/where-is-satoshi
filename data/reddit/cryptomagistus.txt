You can buy stuff (well, specifically limited edition Crypto related fine art prints) for Ether right here: http:  
Fine art might be one of the few things that has a shot at appreciating more than your coins long term...

I hear that.  I don't really work illustratively.

I've been making cryptomancy drawings. This one is Bitcoin's.
These drawings are made with ink and sea water mixed with Irish moss (a seaweed used by herbalists used to gain financial fortune). In this case, a rainstorm broke while I was preparing the paper on the sea shore, hence the splattered look.
Once an abstract pattern has been established on the paper, I work with pen and ink to draw-out imagery.
In this case, a Zeus like figure advances west, flanked by two beasts breathing flame and crystal. In his hand is a lightening bolt and a spike. The king of Cryptos moves as a force without ending.
I will be sharing other cryptomancy drawings on Reddit pages for various coins as they are finished.
Perhaps it is good luck, time will tell.
