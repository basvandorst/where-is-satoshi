Incorrect.  You are being recommended "Circle" because of your previous searches and/or Apps which you have installed.
See the link you posted, it includes "*store/recommended?*" in it.

Came here to say this.  It's not awfully close, it's the same exact name.   It's very very popular in Sweden so this is most certainly a poor name choice by mycelium.

Yeah, I'm well aware of US data caps, but I'd love to see some **global** statistics on internet data caps.  Thanks anyway!
My impression was that speeds might be slower due to development and infrastructure, but that data caps in general for **home** internet use was not too common (existent but minor).

You have peaked my curiosity with that statement.  I was under the impression that the minority of ISP's around the world applied data caps on home internet.  Got any good stats to back up your claim?  No criticism, just thirsty to get a more global picture on this!

There is where I think the problem lies.
Those of us for this change, see it as more acceptable to have a logical, binary result.  No fee? Never gonna happen.  Fee? It will happen.
You seem to prefer the less binary option, which I predict will lose out to the majority who prefer a binary and predictable outcome.
I am for this change, as it removes the doubt of "oh, I forgot to put a fee.  Maybe it will transfer in a few hours, a few weeks, a few months...".  This way, I know it didn't and won't and proceed to make a transaction with a fee.  Done and done.  No doubt!
And as a side note, I am firm believer of enforced transaction fees (we are taking cents or micro cents here!) and as the block rewards decrease over time I think they will play a larger role in the economic side of mining.  Currently not large, but I think this change paves the way to helping this.

Cool. I've sent them feedback to update their website!

Great list, but when was this created? It doesn't seem up to date as ProXPN for example has 21 endpoints in 15 different countries.
Perhaps open the spreadsheet for commenting or make an extra worksheet and have that be open for editing.  Users can comment on things to correct/fix/update there?
EDIT: Commenting is turned on, feedback provided there!

Strange, their website must be lacking updates.
There you can see the info from their official Android app. Endpoints listed on the left.

1st Image does not apply at all? Your 2nd image shows them saying word for word "You may still send your balance offsite to an external address"? So they didn't claim your money as their own, just shut it down for some reason...

I live in Sweden and have never used Coinbase in my life... Anyway, don't take your tinfoil hat off for us.

No no no.  They are brute forcing the keyspace and if you have any modern bitcoin wallet, the chance of your keys being cracked are near impossible. They are not even scratching the surface of the immense keyspace, so this should not be something to fear/act on.
