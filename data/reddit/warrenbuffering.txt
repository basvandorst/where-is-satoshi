Underrated comment

Agreed, that's why I said in a perfectly free market. Barriers to entry, scale... many things keep us from acheiving a truly free market.

Right? I think we're still bouncing on our way down to stability. 20K to 14 &gt; 14 to 18 &gt; 18 to 12 &gt; 12 to 16 &gt; 16 to 10..... Just a long term correction from the surge the last three months of last year, drawn out by FOMO. Question is, and has been (hence the mini-breakouts) where will it find stability

Right? Long-term, the price doesn't matter. As long as my number of coins is going up, I'm winning.

You're in luck

Actually this is a very valid statement. Long term HODLer here, but the most recent gains are somewhat pyramidy in nature. It will go back up, but not until it comes down first, and the next round.of gains will be much more realistic.

Just wait, the real pain is yet to come. Positive LT, but it's gonna be a bumpy ride for a bit

No such thing as economic profit in a truly free-market, long-term. Happy hump day!
