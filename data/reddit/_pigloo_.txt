Yes this is reading real time data from the blockchain and representing it in a visual style.

I have seen it and its incredibly soothing, it was one of my inspirations for Bitbonkers, I have posted it on the r/dataisbeautiful thread a few hours ago. People noticed that if you have Bitbonkers running with Bitlisten in the background it makes a good combo, I am even considering linking to Toshi.io to have them sync up better.

feature request for version 2 noted, however the bigger the ball the quicker it disappears.

No that was my fault, needed to update the cache on Cloudflare after making a change. oooops

I love that this has been entertaining your cat!
The purple spheres are the biggest but cool idea to have the whole thing rocking.

The old blocks will not return after they fall off, the current one will keep coming back.
@_date: 2016-04-01 01:00:59
agreed, will have a go.

The mobile version has slightly cut down graphics compared to the desktop version, but it is amazing what phones can display these days!

OK I have moved most images to an amazon S3 bucket and compressed everything I can so you might have better luck now.

Thank you! The blocks represent the latest block found on the blockchain, the size represents how big it its in bytes, I had to set a minimum though as occasionally a microscopic one turns up.

Explaining Bitcoin wasn't really what I had in mind when I created it, I just put my love for BTC together with learning a bit of WebGL. However your point was taken and I updated the text a bit to clarify what was going on, so thanks for your input and the compliment.

Agreed, but hopefully it will give people a nice way to see that Bitcoin is alive and healthy.

Yeah I did, and the 130,000 visitors hitting my site so far today!

It requires an up to date browser, preferably Chrome as it uses webGL. Also you can check the Javacript console to see if it has connected successfully to Blockchain.io websocket.

I did consider this kind of idea as it happens, it would be pretty taxing on the users computer though as some blocks have quite a few hundred TXs. I ended up making this way as it is self regulating, I might expand on it in the future though.

got 900+ concurrent visitors right now so my server is getting a bit overloaded, try again and you should get through. Wasn't expecting so much traffic!

Yes you should see a block everytime one is mined unless there is an error, sometimes blocks can take over an hour though?

I have been considering the best way of visualising the blockchain in a fun way, love the idea of VR bitcoin payments.
