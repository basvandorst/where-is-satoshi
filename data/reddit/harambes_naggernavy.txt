Question from a noob here.... I have my bitcoin through Robinhood, so not real bitcoin essentially. Whats the most popular and safe way to get actual bitcoin?

is option 2 really that cheap? colored me surprised. Ice cream for the win.

i understand the concept of bitcoin as well, but robinhood makes it very simple for new people to jump in on bitcoin (especially those treating it like a stock, which was my initial intention)

yeah i bought at 7k then sold at 10k. Then bought again at 11.5k yesterday. Figure i'd get it before the big jump. im new to this so im just here for the ride.

biggest question is.... how are you going to spend it?
@_date: 2019-06-27 17:12:07

problem is ive been buying bitcoin on Robinhood and only recently learning it is not the ideal way to go.
Is the easiest/safe way to start in the US is buy on CASH APP and then transfer it to a personal wallet? Once in the wallet i can purchase items / goods or sell my bitcoin still?

Yeah, im new... so like this was a fun ride i guess. not sure how to feel. bragged to some friends that i was a wizard... now im just optimistic my wife wont take me out onto the back porch and beat the shit out of me later today haha

yeah i only had my toe dipped in with $200. threw in an extra $800 in the last 24 hrs. figured might as well jump in at some point.
