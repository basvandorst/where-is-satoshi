Of course! I like him because he’s pretty genuine, and even though sometimes I think he’s wrong about certain things, it makes him seem more human and I love that. Been with him since the early days too!
And yes Posty because he’s just a sweetheart! I have tickets to his show I’m so excited to meet him.

Pretty much what I was trying to say except better lol

Well if I can be honest with you, it’s actually the same  for the opposite. If you find it hard to lose weight, it means you are eating TOO much, and/or the wrong things. In your case, if you really wanted to lose weight/not gain weight, then you need to count the calories you’re taking in, and exercise so that you’re burning more calories than you’re eating. 
Gaining weight, and losing weight is all science, (Except if you have a medical condition) so if you really want to do it you can!

What do you mean where did I say your name? I’m having trouble understanding you. 
Of course they exist, I’m just saying I never called you fat?! 
Are you ok?? Or am I the one who’s not getting it?
@_date: 2017-11-25 12:49:45
Yep I agree with this completely. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 08:56:06
Doesn’t sound too healthy man.

Okay we’re on the same page now!
I was confused because my favourite Youtuber is a thicc boy and so is one of my fav artists.

I guess you don’t need to. It helps though. 
The thing is you need a certain amount of carbs, fat and protein.. so counting calories let’s you know if you’re getting those certain amounts. As Appleseed to just eating fruit and veggies and hoping you are.

Yeah he’s so “not perfect” that it gives you the idea that he’s not just another act. Of course he is an act a lot of the time, and he plays a character, but he’s not like other celebs who are manicured and are almost a product. 
Post is the same sort of. 
Yeah, it sucks but it’s a reality. I don’t do drugs, but ALL my friends do. I’m close to Posts age so I get it.

No I’m not arguing that. I’m saying FAT is specifically unhealthy if you have excess amounts of it. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 16:16:31
Well he has a girlfriend so I agree with that. I disagree, and think he definitely does pills, and coke probably.
..and Budlight

Who is “hating” on fat people? We’re stating facts. It’s science. You aren’t a special snow flake. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 15:22:51
I never said you were.. Jesus Christ calm down. 
@_date: 2017-11-25 11:03:38
Well then I’d say we agree  dude. I never was. 
I wouldn’t say it’s healthier than a six pack if the person with a six pack is getting all the nutrients and vitamins (and calories) they need though?
@_date: 2017-11-25 09:32:38
Uh okay good for you dude. Be happy with who you are. Being overweight isn’t ever healthy though. 
Your life sounds really good, and I’m happy for you. But my expectation of “healthy” is a reality, not an opinion. Excess fat is unhealthy.
