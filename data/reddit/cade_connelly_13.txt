PSA for the millionth time: BTC is *not* for long term investments. It is an alternative currency useful for conducting business in ways and/or products that statist regimes do not approve of, or for untraditional transactions.

Unfortunately capitalism only works if you have a prayer of getting any significant capital, which is why Sanders the Socialist went from nobody to stardom and almost to the White House. As much as I WANT to be optimistic and believe the Forbes article I really have to say I don't see it happening barring some drastic changes.

It's almost like promotions and training are as dead as the dodo and the only way to get a college degree is to win the scholarship lottery (I did, 2 years at a community college) or go into massive debt.
Meanwhile we have a 1%er bellowing about bringing about prosperity...by building a wall.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:43:05
This, sadly enough, is true from my experience.

Working hard =/= working a McJob where lobbying for a raise the only way you can is seen as Communist-inspired treason.

Calling our ruined mess of an economic system "capitalism" is like saying a hand grenade is the same thing as an atomic bomb because they both explode.
@_date: 2017-11-09 04:41:19
Which does squat when you have to work 2 min-wage jobs with no chance of raise or promotion.

I'll take any ally I can get. Especially with recent movements by governments to curtail/tax/spy on Bitcoin.

Depends on the 'paper' formula. It may not burn or may emit clouds of nasty ass smoke.

At this point it's so bad that there basically is no nation.

Well you are at least half right. You generally do NOT want to hang on to crypto for long term value, unless you're holding a big store waiting for the price to go up. It's not a viable replacement for the entire system. Unfortunately.

Hey Alexa: what is "insanity"?

And a racist, don't forget that useless catchall term.

Literally THE only way to get your wealth out of your nation in a Venezuelan scenario without actually carrying anything on you. Or if you insist on a hardware wallet, if you can say its your cellphone or hide it in a credit-card-sized space (or smaller) you're home free.

Which is why I keep telling people the purpose of Bitcoin IS NOT to make you rich. It is a way for free men and women to conduct transactions in way that bypasses the overbearing, pocket-picking and spy-ridden *mess* that is the "legitimate" ^(ROTFLOL) economy. 
If you try to use it **for any other purpose** you will either get lucky or burned.

That **whump, whump, whump** sound is your ass getting kicked, n00b.

Between inflation, wage stagnation, the possibility of UBI and/or Yangbucks becoming a reality, I'd say so.

That's why your teachers had such a hard time.

I hope they deal with it more sternly than we do.

If you have an army now would be a good time to invade and take over, frankly.

That inexpressable feeling of having some control over your own money again...it is **powerful**. It brings *hope*. And THAT is why bitcoins are not dead nor dying.

Stage 5: "Bitcoin? Nope, i don't have any bitcoin to pay taxes on."
@_date: 2019-04-01 19:09:48
This needs to be something to keep in mind. As much as crypto lets us give a big fat middle finger to the powers-that-be there are situations where it is useless.

Bitrate absolutely sucks, but it *can* be done.
Back in the day i knew people who did it for networking when WLAN didn't exist and dial-up capable phone lines didn't reach them.

Mismanagement from a socialist nation with had one export *finally* hit critical mass.

Unfortunately for your conspiracy theory, Venezuelan crude is actually so contaminated out the yin-yang with sulfur it takes a ton of effort to 'clean' it. We can get better crude literally a dozen other places.

Hello there crazy coup conspiracy person!

Considering how often the US government has outright stolen stockpiles of gold (Liberty Dollar, anyone?) I'd say this is a far wiser choice.

My costs are basically squat, the bill to the customer will include shipping as they'll be able to pick their shipping speed from wherever they're ordering from. (ie; ordering from amazon, you tell me what shipping method you want, that's part of the bill)
