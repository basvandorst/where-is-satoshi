I have read that, too but I can not find a source or official ruling on the tax free part (besides the article on Die Welt). All I get from Frank Schaeffler's site and other sources is that it will be classified as an asset for the first year of holding, qualifying for the flat rate tax of 25% and will be a "private good" afterwards. Every sale of goods and services that is not explicitely classified differently, will be taxed as a private sale (income tax). If you sell regularly aiming for a profit, you have to register a business (Gewerbe), including additional costs.
@_date: 2014-06-17 11:27:59
I am not sure if this would definitely break cryptos, as there is no real incentive to do an attack and is does not damage your own holding (other than dropping the price). I could imagine a broad distribution of market share in mining once Bitcoin enters the mainstream (comparable to the semiconductor market), but it surely is necessary to find a solution to remove potential for panics and further annoyances or even the need of a hard fork.

What have been the alternatives, yet? If there are ways around banks, people are going to use them and drive the banks out.


Equity, stocks, options etc. Products people pay way too much for their bank to handle. 


First 1M is usually free and up to 1% afterwards, as a customer I am paying 1% for my credit card purchases at the moment. Every 0.1% is huge for most merchants for a system that is so easy to implement in comparison to any cc system. Merchants are completely free from any volatility risk, if they choose to pay the 1% after the first million. They could decide to pay no fee at all and keep the Bitcoin though. Volatility will be there for any cryptocurrency/competitor for Bitcoin in the first years of implementation, though. No way around that.

Just because projects and technologies failed in the past, does not mean Bitcoin has to fail as soon as VCs invest into Bitcoin, the economy and related services. I don't understand how you can say that it will not lead to growth if a lot of people are interested in building a Bitcoin economy and investing into Bitcoin.
What you are saying is that growth of userbase went down in the last months and years and stops now or is stagnating, while people claiming everyone who joins Bitcoin is still an early adopter now are saying the userbase will still grow significantly and the current trend will continue to some degree.

This has been discussed here a lot and many times. I think everyone in that market knows why people would like to use a cryptocurrency, mainly to stay mostly anonymous and not let your wife/girlfriend/SO know what you are doing with your money. Bitcoin is clearly the better choice for site operators and users, how would you explain to your wife why you are buying Titscoin?

Yes, that is true, but banks have to prove matching maturities for deposits and loans (if they lend out money over a long term, they have to prove long term deposits up to a certain amount/percentage), at least in most countries, where Basel regulations apply. If these measures become a standard, banks may be motivated to not keep customers deposits anymore and therefore to minimize their liquidity reserve. This could become a problem some time, but massively complaining and advising to switch to Bitcoin immediately is an overreaction of course.

Hey, I am all for a fair world, although it is hard to determine what exactly is "fair" here. Everyone thinks differently, as you can see in our discussion! :)
My conception here stems from management and business theory, so it can not be that different from most people. Every new technology has to go through the stages of innovation. From creation, distribution in a growing network and growing adoption and general awareness.
To make a copy that is fairer you first need to raise awareness for users and merchants in a bigger scale than there already is for Bitcoin. That is extremely expensive, so you would want to keep most of the premine for yourself (covering expenses) and sell the coins to people that want them from someone who just invented it.
I somehow do not see that happen, but I am open to hear an alternative scenario.

In that case you would need something like an NFC wallet, where the devices communicate and your device accepting the payment request and pushing the payment out without your assistance. Perfectly possible, just needs someone to program it.
But this would only be incredibly risky, as anybody with a mobile device nearby could spam you with payment requests and hope that your device initiates a transaction.
The idea would surely be nice to pay anything without the need to reach for any device, card or note but would add a lot of attack vectors.

Exactly, but being a depositor with a high value account does not necessarily make you part of that group. Allowing governments to draw from these accounts may make it easier to draw from all the other accounts later on, once they find a reason to do that.
If I had to propose an alternative solution, I would enforce maturity matching for assets, financial instruments and business practices as well as enough reserves to cover potential losses from speculations (I think something like that was proposed with Basel III). Maybe some of these banks that always get in trouble and pay billions in fines (e.g. Deutsche Bank) could be barred from risky business practices or responsible employees could be punished with more than a fine.

The same way you do chargebacks now, you either hold the funds in your system until the payment is resolved or you reimburse the "victim" out of your own reserve and ask the other party to pay you back.
There is no monetary system that supports chargeback, but it can be much easier and cheaper with Bitcoin, as payments can be tracked and verified easily.


Are there any that do not do this? Every bank has its highly paid specialists (and machines) that scan banknotes and coins for counterfeits. Payments are usually conducted by hand (employees are checking payments regularly). I was called a few times and asked if the payment is correct and if this is my signature etc.

Sure, that depends on negotiation and you would probably pay a lot more than the current valuation as it still is a fast growing business, but it gives an idea of how much that specific company is worth approximately. Those approximations do not work for Bitcoin, though. You can not buy all the bitcoins for the current market capitalization and you would get a lot less than that if everyone decides to sell to a single entity. Therefore the market capitalization *may* be a fair representation of value for a company, but does not do a comparably good job for Bitcoin.

Yes, it is true that companies can grow very large and operate on a high margin by creating and lobbying for high barriers of entry. Without them, many smaller competitors would enter the market and offer products for a much smaller margin. Bigger and older companies do have advantages even in free and unregulated markets, though. They can make use of economies of scale, invest more out of reserves and loans, are better known to potential customers etc.
On the other hand, we could see a forward-integration of semiconductor producers or a market comparable to that. The balance seen there would be very good for Bitcoin: [Link](

I think it is a very good idea in theory but most of the implications of colored coins need legitimization of governments, especially when it comes to transfer of ownership (e.g. entry in a land charge register in a notary office for transfer of ownership of land/houses etc.). As this is not there yet, there is no reason for a practical launch of colored coins and other Bitcoin 2.0 applications.

Sure, indications concerning legitimization and legality of Bitcoin is limited, as it pretty much is legitimized already.

Why would you need that extra step inbetween and not directly buy goods and services with Bitcoin?
Nobody would sell his gold for cash if it would be easily exchangable everywhere for goods and services. People also tend to spend Bitcoin for goods and services when the price is high and rising, disproving the claims that inflation is necessary.
Edit: Yes, there are many interesting experiments in the altcoin world. Most of them can be adopted into Bitcoin, if deemed necessary. Most of the altcoins are merely hyped carbon copies used to get the initiator rich quickly. Not all of them have a purpose. If you already have Litecoin running on a bigger network, you do not need another copy with any changes other than the name (Auroracoin &amp; co.).

Only if you choose to keep the payment in bitcoin as a merchant. If you do not want to be exposed to any risk, you can choose to directly receive US$ or other currencies from bitpay/coinbase.

Yeah, most altcoins seem to work as a ramp for miners that still work with CPUs and GPUs, while driving up the prices of graphic cards (a friend of mine tried to buy a new graphic card, they said they are out of stock because of Litecoin mining).

Just show them a few good infomercials on Bitcoin and let them decide for themselves.
For people living in the USA there may not be a lot of reasons yet to really use Bitcoin only for commerce and local transactions. The main reason to entry is a hedge against central bank failure, store of value and appreciation of assets with commerce coming after that. That may change as soon as adoption increases.
@_date: 2014-06-11 15:12:16
As the market fors Bitcoins (as a mining product) and cloud mining (as a service) are becoming regular, free and maturing markets with an open competition, market theory applies. It is very uncommon for free and unregulated market that there is no single entity with &gt;50% market share. The leader always gets most of the cake and the others share what is left over.
The alternatives are either to let GHash (or any competitor) dominate the market or regulate through code.
@_date: 2014-06-27 11:03:02
Yes, that is also what went through my mind.
As everyone who invested millions in these coins at the auction is interested in appreciation of his investments, they will probably announce what they paid for them or what they plan to do with them if it is not way under the current market price. Even if you just wanted to arbitrage an profit out of the auction, you would need to pump up the price to sell into the buying pressure.
Therefore, I think we will see announcements on monday from at least one party that participated in the auction.

Yes, this is still a problem to some degree and will be fixed in summer (for Bitcoin) with price fixing for bigger NY-based exchanges. This is a problem for all cryptocurrencies and especially for those with small market cap and liquidity. If a lot of money is moved in relation to existing liquidity and market capitalization, the exchange price can become very volatile. And this is exactly why we need a higher market capitalization and liquidity and Bitcoin is the only cryptocurrency pointing in the right direction here.

Bank wire isn't free either, but may be the better choice if bigger amounts are transacted and both parties need the local currency and can wait a few weeks. In that case, no remittance service would get any business.
I am jealous for any person in the world that can afford to invest $30 million with expectation of a high failure probability, but I don't think this person exists. The VC who invested half a Million in facebook also was pretty sure that it won't fail. But still, investment and projects are much bigger than last year at the same time. As general failure expectation for VCs didn't change, it may as well be ignored. Most of them also wouldn't invest in a saturated or stagnating market.

I heard that a lot.
ASICs basically work on almost every algorithm (hence the name). For 6 algorithms, you can run 6 ASICs. There is nothing stopping that.
Mining and securing the network on a machine that is not intended to do that (CPUs and GPUs in your PC) is not an efficient way to "run" a cryptocurrency. There will be mining pools and bigger mining farms for every cryptocurrency that may be interesting.
You also shouldn't confuse mining with markets and the price finding process.

Let's say you have an new Cryptocurrency you want to distribute and give them out to thousands without a price finding process.

I never said, the price will not go down but I said it is an overreaction, as the functionality of an exchange does not influence the way Bitcoin works in the long run.

I see what you are trying to say. To your question what is stopping Google, the answer would be rational business decisions.
I doubt they would be able to offer lower costs for transactions than Bitcoin is able to (because of costs for development, maintenance and support etc) and it is far from their core business, which is collecting information and capitalizing on them. Google Wallet is a pretty good example. They have all your loyalty programs in there, bank accounts, credit cards and so on. They can see what you are buying and how much you are paying, maybe even how much money you got in total.
If you do not believe in conspiracies and banks raging war against Bitcoin, the rational way would be to include Bitcoin into Google Wallet as soon as there are enough users and see how much you spend, where you send money to and how much Bitcoin you have in your wallet. Would be nice info for the NSA, too. At no cost at all. :)

Exactly, Bitcoin is not intended to compete with credit cards, as those are only a service on top of the monetary system. Credit card companies may work on top of Bitcoin but not compete with it.


I think Overstock shows what companies are gaining from Bitcoin. They can accept payments from anywhere in the world directly without (significant) delay. No fraud by foreign customers, no wait for payments, no expensive fees for currency options for customers in instable countries. Bitcoin enables companies to efficiently operate on international scales.

So the MtGox exchange was exposed to this flaw for over 2 years and nobody knows exactly to which extent this has been exploited. So I think you are right, this is a big problem, but will hopefully not be exploitable in the future.

By reduction of complexity, I am saying that all you need is to say:
"Send this amount of money to this address." 
You do not need to know how Bitcoin works in all its technical details and you do not need to spend anything for fraud/counterfeit detection and transaction execution and confirmation besides a few cents (or a lot less with bundled or high priority transactions). 
Looking at how much vectors of fraud there are and how much operational costs are bound to transactions, this is neither automated enough nor good enough.
Credit card companies did not incorporate Bitcoin (yet), therefore you would still have a first mover advantage but maybe not for long.

That's true. You would also be able to achieve a high percentage over a longer time frame and there is a high variance where you could go hours without a reward even at 50%.
But on the other hand, the incentives to do such an attack are not as rewarding as most people think, as you are not able to steal coins or do other things that are more profitable than regular mining.
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:31:18
You would need to further define your conditions:

- How do you determine public opinion?

Yes, the chasm is the point where a technology jumps from its early stages of development into the mainstream. Many technologies fail here and fade away, it is one of the most critical points for adoption.
Based on that graph, I would say we are slowly getting closer to that chasm, with first early adopters stepping in.
@_date: 2014-06-19 09:32:01


Yes, but because there is a lot of luck and variance involved, 24 hours of block rewards is not a fair representation of hash rate. Sometimes they mine 5 or 6 blocks in a row and sometimes they do not have any blocks for hours, that's why we need to have a longer timeframe to see if their reported hashrate is true. I like to look at [blockorigin]( which takes the last 2016 blocks in account and has a better methodology for calculation.

The regulators are as greedy and corrupt as anyone and therefore control the market in a way that benefits them the most (which can be very bad for most other market participants and cripple the economy).
I don't know if there could be a comparable situation in a regulated market, but massive manipulation and price-fixing especially in the currency markets tend to show the incompetency of regulators.
I am pro gun control and pro minimum wage, though (proven benefits as less violence and better living standards without hurting the economy).

He doesn't worry much about it, he didn't say that there is no threat. As a 51% attack would not necessarily kill Bitcoin, the motivation to spend a few hundred million dollars to conduct actions that can be rolled back may not be really big, although it is there of course. 
In my opinion, most people here (especially cryptoanarchist and liberalist) severely overstate how Bitcoin influences the banking system. Banks do not need your money as a deposit anymore and they are glad if you do your transactions anywhere else, as it is extremely unprofitable. Bitcoin would be more of a boon as a threat for banks if implemented correctly.

There is no such thing as data limitation here. You can easily download many terabytes per month without a problem and the networks are expanded everywhere around here so in this ascpect, internet speeds will grow faster than Bitcoin. Disk space is pretty abundand, so I do not see a limitation there.


Any business and private person that has the capacity and a vested interest in Bitcoin (The blockchain data itself is **hugely** valuable once it reaches a fraction of VISA). This is exactly what decentralization is about, while high schoolers like you call everything centralized that is not fully distributed. No one ever expected every single user to run a full node and nobody does now.
But after all, there are some measures to counter these limitations as you said, I would add improvements to blockchain data to it to make itself and the bloating smaller.

Theory is that the price and number of transactions should by high enough by then to make confirming transactions alone profitable. As the supply shrinks slowly, the network should have enough time to adopt.

Almost every type of information transfer can work on a decentralized, public ledger. The blockchain has some limitation issues which could potentially be solved, but that's it. I don't see a decentralized open system around the corner and everyone waiting for that may be left behind in the course of the next years.

I know what you mean, but at first Bitcoin was not designed to make anyone rich and it works perfectly without making anyone rich.
The growth we have seen in the last 5 years is not that unusual if you compare it to startups that start very little, but thanks to their revolutionary idea, get very big. Many VC and other influential people were allowed to invest in these startups and have hugely benefited from it, comparable to the first people buying Bitcoin.
At first look, Bitcoin's growth therefore may seem a little fishy/scammy, but if you look under the hood there is nothing to worry about, considering the uses it was designed for.

"According to Silbert, the exchange will have three main functions.
Firstly, it will focus on price discovery. Using the gold market as a model, the exchange will attempt to fix the value of bitcoin once or twice a day to allow trading to be pegged at certain values and create a true indicator for the derivatives and mining markets."

Do we really need that intermediary?
Will it be easier to convert your USD into a decentralized form and then exchange it for Bitcoin and not just push the boundaries around? And if yes, this solves the problem for one country, but not for the rest of the world.

It is a long time until 2020. I remember that people have been called crazy in the beginning of 2013 for predicting an exchange price of over $100 for 1 BTC.

Yeah, I could imagine that many people think this way. This is also why there are so many competitors for POS payment systems, but no clear winner. Merchants just don't know which one they should take. This is also why we would need a major adoption in users before it hits merchants and their costs significantly.
You make it sound like inventing something better than Bitcoin is easy and could happen any moment, but in fact almost every idea developers come up with could be easily implemented on top of the blockchain to make both ideas flourish. If it would be easy to revolutionize payments and money transactions, Bitcoin would not be the first real innovation in 40 years. Everyone waiting for something "better" will probably wait a few decades as well.

Well they are discussing events, retailers and apps that could increase the price there, so I thought that might be helpful for you. I would agree with some of the points there like Cyprus and NeoBee initiating a successful crypto economy, Wall Street jumping in (or anticipation of people that want to get in before them) and the first quarterly reports of bigger companies like Overstock and Zynga showing big savings (in transaction costs) because of Bitcoin. In my opinion, the price development looks quite similar to the situation of april to july of last year (so this bubble seems to work out similar to the last). So speaking of this we **may** be back in the four figures by July 1st 2014, cautiously speaking. The last ATH would be a really though resistance and if the market clears that it could lead to a new bubble.

This is wrong. Bitcoin can be used for anything better than current systems, as long as velocity is high enough to cancel out any volatility. Today, it is still mostly used as a store of value, though. Once (and If) liquidity and market capitalization are high enough for further purposes, everyone can and will use Bitcoin (mostly without knowing).

45% of the hashrate consists of their own hardware (at least that is what they said last time they were very close to 50% and switched off some miners to lower their share).
Most (bigger) miners are far from being amortized, so they would sit on useless hardware without breaking even. If future income can be planned as a profit, future loss can planned as a loss. I don't think anyone who could choose to get 1 million every day from now or 2 million tomorrow and nothing after that, would choose the latter.

You do not need to trust merchants you interact directly with, as you get the product directly and walk away with it. Doing a chargeback afterwards would be fraud.
But I get what you are trying to say. If you order a good from a smaller merchants from around the world and pay him in Bitcoin directly (or a direct bank transfer), he may not send his goods to you and may not be accessible for a court.
If Bitcoin is widely accepted, you can use your credit card or PayPal to do any transaction with people you do not trust with your money, but with your personal information. Credit card companies, PayPal and other third party companies offer a service on top of a monetary system and can incorporate Bitcoin or use the network without problems. Doing this service is a lot easier and cheaper if you have a system where you can track payments. 
There is no monetary system that inherently supports chargebacks, chargebacks are neither a problem of Bitcoin nor is it harder to implement, if really needed. The only point of criticism is that it is not widely used/implemented yet. Although some people (me included) do not really see a huge utility in that, compared to the costs and problems it brings.

Liquid currency is not the only use case for Bitcoin, but rather the smaller one measured in market capitalization. You should add store of value, payments for goods, services and remittances and representation of equity and commodities to your calculation.
Edit: You should also compare liquid currency to available liquidity in Bitcoin. In best case, there will be about half a million Bitcoin available at any given moment to use as liquid currency. Therefore you should multiply that number by 42, at least. And add the other use cases for the rest of the valuation.
@_date: 2014-08-08 14:34:17

$525 million? 3600 Bitcoin are mined daily, which is $1,620,000 at current rates.
[Here]( is an interesting video that calculates how much it would cost to do an attack on yourself. Be sure to check out part 2 where he talks about possibilities of attack and prevention.
Personally, I don't think you could profit more from attacks than from mining as you may get a days worth profit but the price may fall faster than you can get these coins to the exchange (assuming the attack will be noticed). On the other hand, there may be motivations outside of pure profit to destroy the network and we should look into ways to make this much harder (Andresen's proposal in part 2).

Source on the claim that the 200,000 coins will be sold on exchanges?
Sounds like a lose-lose decision. There already are buyers for the SR coins (144k) for the market price without the need to sell under value.
Why should anyone sell them on exchanges and not through auctions or other means without losing half the worth?
Edit: I am not an expert on japanese law regarding bankruptcy, but I saw multiple sources stating it is comparable to german law in that matter. This would prohibit a sell on exchanges and they would be obliged to auction off all outstanding assets.
So the correct title should be: Buy now or suffer a fate worse than Darkwings (sold at $25-35 and bitching since then).

@_date: 2014-07-26 16:26:35


Detection of counterfeiting is logically done at deposit, but there are many types of fraud in payments (e.g. ACH clearing, although I am not an expert here).


Because there is no unified system to track and verify payments without necessity to trust the operators. Building the current system on top of a distributed, public ledger that handles the transaction on fraction of costs may lead to benefits for anyone (even if you do not use Bitcoin directly).
In my opinion, everyone involved wins through the implementation (it is not just a zero-sum speculation game), not only the merchants we see today but everyone who does any kind of transactions or wants to prove anything on the public ledger (regarding all the other ways of implementing the blockchain).

So your argument is that Bitcoin's sole reason of existence lies in its (non-inherent) anarchistic ideology many of the innovators connected to it and it is solely used for a store of value and speculation of rising value?
Do you really not see any other utility besides trading it for fiat? Most of those that came in after 2011 may be interested in other use-cases and many of the VCs stated that those innovators will be driven away by Bitcoin' approach into the mainstream.

On the other side, not buying any BTC does not offer you any hypothetical ROI. ;)
There are indications that Bitcoin users tend to spend more when they think their purchase power is growing and favorable, leading to more purchases at higher prices: 
There are less sales on (perceived) low exchange rates, which may indicate that people spend more on high prices and buy/hold more on low exchanges prices.

The blockchain supports anything you mentioned (and more) as a platform but applications on top of the blockchain need to be programmed and released/tested together with the legal framework (depending on country).
So it supports smart contracts, stock issuance etc. the same way the internet supported video applications before they have been released.

The post linked was talking about an international payment, IIRC. I do not think it has anything to do with burying the head in sand, but rather presenting a use case and a positive experience. This is also very important to spread awareness of the benefits of Bitcoin. 
Even if the majority is not interested in international payments, remittance is still &gt;$500bn yearly and international business on top of that surely won't make that smaller. What I think is groundbreaking for Bitcoin here is the ability to either wait for a payment before sending the goods (after an average of an hour you can be sure not to be scammed vs. weeks/months or fraud through paypal or other systems).
All the things you listed are services from third parties that could theoretically be used similarly or better. But you are right that here is the battlefield for Bitcoin in national payment systems (where it faces the most competitors).

I agree, cryptocurrency will be accepted any way, but to open a legal and professional exchange based in the US, operators and Investors would have to have some legal clarity, especially considering money transaction and tax guidelines. Lawsky's approach seems to be very positive for possible bitcoin exchanges and businesses in New York, in my opinion.

Alright, maybe some people need that to wake up or get interested in a problem. I prefer rational and logical arguments. I see sensationalist articles and threads that get reposted frequently with the sole motivation to create fear, uncertainty and doubt as FUD.
The 51% issue is surely is one of the biggest vulnerabilities left for cryptocurrencies and we may need a solution to disallow 51% attack, although this could lead to more centralization if one entity can grab a bigger share without leading to a crash. If the community wants to contribute to a solution, we need to work on a forum/thread where we discuss a possible solution without shouting at irrational/incompetent actors.

I am not an expert considering the law, so do not count on that but if you see a product with a price written underneath it and you declare to buy that for the price, this is a legitimate contract in most cases (two corresponding declarations of intent). Some companies try to decline certain people as customers, but get sued pretty quickly.
Merchants in retail are allowed to decline certain means of payment/payment systems (e.g. Visa is often declined here or debit cards for small payments [many cafes/restaurants in Berlin already prefer Bitcoin here]), but not the currency itself. Bitcoin is currently defined as private money/commodity and a legitimate payment system in Germany and therefore accepting payments is due to the merchant to accept.
If it was defined as a legal tender you would have the right to pay in Bitcoin whereever you like

I would not be so sure on that. The majority of the population would agree on **any** measure regarding Bitcoin without hesitation if sold by an authority figure, especially in the United States of America.
I do not really see the banning aspect as the proposed licenses seem to be similar to a banking license but if you really like to influence him, try to thank him for his efforts in enabling the Bitcoin community to thrive in the state of new york but propose a few improvement (for everyone involved) for the licences. That is the only way to wage your influence there.

Sure, there will be a turning point where they would have to make a decision against the current system or against the USD.

Yes, that is already the case. Most types of information are kept on centralized, private ledger. There **may** be use-cases, where a transformation to a blockchain may be interesting, but this surely won't happen before mass adoption of the idea.


I don't say there is absolutely no possibility that Bitcoin can be rendere obsolete anytime soon. I think with hundreds of million in venture and private capital bound in investments and startups and a lot of economical growth on the horizon, it may not be the best idea to wait until something better comes around. All of the "competition" we see are either hard-forks with a few changed numbers or solutions build from scratch that nobody really uses. I think we might see either a worthy competitor or a significant improvement of the protocol as soon as it hits its boundaries in transactions per second or blockchain size, but until then Bitcoin is **The** growth market in transactions, store of value and digital currency.

According to management theory the early majority starts after 16% of potential users adopted the technology (little error there). So that's ~443 million.

Well, that already sounds better. If you want to analyze businesses and help others to assess them, that is a great starting point.
I just don't see how your initial proposal would be helpful. We had names, pictures and other info on Danny Brewster and the moolah guy (whatever their names are), but nobody can ensure that the info is correct and they can still easily scam you.
Bitcoin does not bring anything new to the economy here, except that it is easier to give scammers your money. They would also run away with your dollars, though. If you don't know how to assess a business, at least wait for 2 or 3 audited yearly reports. I don't think it is that hard. Just because you are able to invest in a business does not mean you should and I do not think that you want your country to hold your hand with every decision you make.

Yes, this will change with higher liquidity. Right now, the volatility is not because of a flaw of Bitcoin or Cryptocurrency, but because of news that shake the market. These swings will obviously be much smaller in the future.
The interesting thing OP was mentioning is that you can now conduct business with people from countries around the world you would probably not trust with credit card or bank information or even with a PayPal payment. You check their work, pay with Bitcoin and the business is done. Or the other way around, you wait an hour until the payment is 100% secure and free of possibility of fraud and send your goods.

No, I do not miss the point. Not every start up operator in the world is a criminal. The only thing you (or we) have to do is to make sure to be able to corrrectly evaluate the business model and associated risks. If you can't do that, keep away from investments of that kind. If you think the business model is fine, you could ask the business owner for the information you would need to trust him. If he can't deliver, keep away from the investment. It is that simple. No need to strangle the economy with harsh regulations, just some common sense to the same degree you should use anywhere else.

If it is defined as a commodity (which is the case in most nations today), capital gains achieved by Bitcoin will be taxed.
If it is defined as a currency and you get paid in Bitcoin, you can be taxed in capital gains (if Bitcoin is not the legal tender and appreciates in relation to the legal tender), income tax (percentage of your Bitcoin income) and sales tax (percentage of product price).
These are the main tax income sources for governments. Bitcoin does not really change these approaches.

This sentiment is exactly why there is so much fraud in the USA. Insurances and reimbursements are **NOT** consumer protection and should **never** be a long term solution to **any** problem. **Please** look that up and demand real consumer protection from your government! Bitcoin allows for improved protection in an environment where you do not have to give away information that allow for easy measures of fraud from anyone you interact with. Also, all services around consumer protection, safety and even chargebacks, reimbursements and insurances and many other things anyone is concerned about are easier to implement in Bitcoin than on the current system. There will not be a way around it in the long term.
On the other hand, if it crashes totally and nobody wants to touch or trade it, you should stay away from it, as any trade involves at least two parties.

I do, considering interest. But most deposit accounts do not offer any interest comparable to the profits banks are generating with that money. There may be a lot more profitable things to do with &gt;€100,000 than to let them sit on a normal account.
In my mind, a deposit account is something where someone safely stores his personal wealth and value without thinking about or participating in the business practices of the bank. And this is where I draw the line. You can not allow a government to draw from that just because they or the bank(s) have made mistakes.
Of course this is a sliding scale as you say, but allowing a big step towards bail-ins like that may allow to easier steps for more control over people's money in the future (to the end of the sliding scale).

At first, I don't know anything about their spending and did not see a financial statement yet.
According to the several advertisement clips they tried to convince the general population to switch to Bitcoin. You should also consider that the population there has several billions underneath their pillows because they are afraid of bank defaults and bail-ins. So that would make sense, if they could convince enough people. The bank-like appeal might have been chosen to provide a trustful environment where everyone could carry his bank notes to deposit. Therefore that idea is OK, if planned correctly. They obviously didn't and that wasn't really that obvious before launch. I would never advise to invest in a company without any proven track record, financial statements and business plan, though.
@_date: 2014-03-17 18:48:17
Yeah, basically I agree on that and on your other post. It already is pretty easy to buy things from Amazon with Bitcoin (Gift cards or other systems), so besides the short term wow effect, it may not really get them more revenue. We would need better payment services for Bitcoin and probably a stronger network considering Amazon's daily transaction (even if only 1% uses Bitcoin, which would be extremely optimistic at this point). So if they don't exactly see a financial incentive to accept Bitcoin yet (due to automatisation and fees/costs in their favor), they can just sit back and see how the Network develops and if other Companies benefit from it or not (only one month left to Overstock's quarterly report).

Point 1 and 3 can be done with a low BTC price if the network works extremely fast and efficient and you somehow cut out the necessity to buy and hold Bitcoin. Depending on how much of this market is done with Bitcoin the necessary market capitalization leads to prices of at least $1000/BTC.

**"Why is Bitcoin different than traditional systems and what problems does it solve?"** (although that is partly covered in your first video)
and 
**"Do I have to wait 10-60 minutes on the point of sale and does this make Bitcoin impossible to use in Brick-and-Mortar shops?"**

Consumers only get cheaper prices in mid and longterm. But as I said, retail shopping is one of the smaller use-cases for Bitcoin and I see more utility in other cases. Merchant adoption is just one of a lot of implementations.
Did you read the articles? For a constant downward slope, you would have to take a comparable amount of days (as few as possible). I was actually talking about the articles linked by you. Byrne says:
“Bitcoin is tiny at this point, but it’s growing about 25% a month. In terms of actual transactions in a day, I think it’s $300m a day. It’s surpassing PayPal, at this point, in terms of transactions. [...] But, it is growing very quickly.”
“In the first day there was an enormous surge of bitcoin sales, but we’ve also seen a gradual building of bitcoin sales in a week-by-week basis.”
"I think that bitcoin payments will account for several percent of all online transactions in the next year or two, and when this happens, Amazon will be forced to start accepting bitcoin on their website.”
There may not be exact numbers, but it looks like sales are steadily growing after the first decrease after the wow effect, just as expected. Of course some are holding back with spending when perceived purchasing power is low, that is why you see less sales at lower prices.
I am not as overly optimistic as Byrne but it takes a lot of ignorance to not see where this is going. But you can of course choose to look away and come back next year.

If he really did what he is accused of, he abused Bitcoin to commit crimes and has to be punished for that.

In that scenario, if Bitcoin is ONLY used as a payment system, the market cap equals the velocity of trade which is not very much of course.
There is no fix for that and no fix needed. People and Business tend to hold Bitcoin though (Overstock's CEO looking for suppliers that accept Bitcoin), use it as a store of value and for money transfer in general etc.

There currently is no market that would exclude any Cryptocurrency, assuming it had enough market capitalization and liquidity. But as soon as people tend to switch randomly between coins and therefore delude value and liquidity, Cryptocurrency becomes pretty much unusable. Therefore there only can be one big leader until a significantly better successor comes along (more than just a bit faster confirmation time or other minimal improvements). With all the projects and developments currently being rolled out and planned for Bitcoin, there really is no future for current altcoins besides functioning as a ramp to Bitcoin.

I think in most situations you could agree on an unpaid internship with Bitcoin as a bonus payment. The exact situation depends on the legal framework in your country and to what degree legal tender has to be used.

Well, he raises some legitimate points for the current status of Bitcoin.
Of course it does not perform poorly as a store of value, but everyone can throw that around as there is no hard definition.
Deposit in a bank and deposit insurance would be no problem at all, if anyone wanted to do that. Just a matter of time.
Debit cards are nominated in Bitcoin, if I remember correctly. Credit/debt in Bitcoin surely would be not such a good idea if the price continues to rise so quickly, but americans love their debt so this seems to get thrown around a lot over there.
Incompability of a fixed money supply to a growing economy assumes, that you buying power would have to be stable over the years. He already experienced, that this is not possible with any system we have invented yet. With a fixed money supply, the price of one unit would grow in relation to worldwide growth of economy.

Ok, but merchants will only see that if they do not have a payment processor, right?

Third parties providing chargebacks are not doing much more than an escrow, holding your funds until the transaction is most likely resolved (180 days for PayPal, at least a month for credit cards). As soon as the funds leave the system no third party can conduct a (real) chargeback, only reimburse you with their own money if they want. With Bitcoin they could outsource transactions, proof of payment etc., therefore chargebacks (with an escrow/third party) using Bitcoin may be easier.

Yes and this is a severe problem. Brock does not have many people in the cryptocurrency sphere that trust him and a decentralized currency should not involve the neccesity to trust anyone in the first place.
Regarding banks and ATMs exchanging USD for realcoin: Why don't they exchange for Bitcoin directly? I would assume that they would need the same kind of regulatory framework as with Bitcoin (EBA warned to wait for it), so I do not really see where realcoin could fit in here.
A decentralized exchange would most likely have to act as an escrow, where people deposit their Bitcoin and their realcoin, to exchange as soon as there is an agreement between two parties, so the least they need to do is an audit of the code to prohibit anyone to run away with deposits, if you really do not want to have any kind of regulation in there.

Well, the standard argument is that nobody is spending Bitcoin because it rises in value. With Bitcoin as the easiest and fastest way to buy and pay for thing, as soon as it is easy to refill your account that is nothing to worry about anymore. Statistics show, that together with more possibilities to spend, more people buy things with Bitcoin (lower duration of holding).
@_date: 2014-02-18 21:11:59
In that case they would have to register at another exchange (if they didn't already) or sell their Bitcoins somewhere else. Depending on how much it rises they could reconsider their position.
@_date: 2014-03-10 17:35:14
I wouldn't say I can **make** money with Bitcoin, but some speculators may see it as a investment vehicle to sell for more later. A higher price is driven through demand and general adoption of markets based on the Bitcoin economy. Besides the hope that someone may buy it for more later, there is also the need to adjust to growing markets and infrastructure due to limited supply.

Appears to be an ad for the fool.
The interesting thing is, that Bitcoin can be accessible to the owner, whereas gold is mostly sold as a certificate with hundreds of people owning that same chunk of gold.


Hashrate and difficulty is almost six times higher than at the last ATH in november and Overstock, Tiger Direct and Zynga (just to name the really big ones) decided to accept Bitcoin after that.

He estimated 0.1% according to [WSJ]( so around $10-15 million per year.

If there would be a possibility of a 51% attack on the Bitcoin network, others are not really affected because Bitcoin is mined with ASICs.
If you build a warehouse full of GPUs, you could attack the biggest Scrypt network and almost every other altcoin network after that and drain all of their markets alltogether.
So an attack on the Bitcoin network means no vulnerability for altcoins. Attack on altcoins mean almost every altcoin is affected but not Bitcoin.
Therefore both cases are exclusive.

I really don't want to insult anyone but if you want to call anyone delusional, look at those saying that automatization and reduction of complexity will not lead to improved processes for the first time in human history. Bitcoin is not more than the next logical step.
Just because there currently are no trustable third parties offering services you love (chargebacks), does not mean there is a fatal flaw in the system.

Yes, this is also why it is hard to have two legal tenders and why Bitcoin can hardly coexist with another legal currency at the same legal status.

Yes, but in cooperation with Bitpay, Bitcoin works exactly like a payment system (by payment system I think of VISA, Paypal etc.), doesn't it?
Bitcoin alone can be used as a Currency, also as a unit of account, exchange system, store of value, asset etc.

There will be nasty letters from your landlord and energy company first, as the energy need would be much higher than the required bandwidth. The only problem scalability poses in the long run is centralization of hashing and mining, assuming bandwidth and disk space do not grow anymore.
Anyone on my block (for example) is using exactly (no "up to" here) 150mbps and the fiber on the street has a much higher capacity. And that's for a small suburb.
Edit: as the 8mbps is nowhere in the near future, the terabit network that has just been tested could download that 2.5 TB in 10-20 seconds.

I think I do not have many adresses (not playing around much with wallets and not trusting exchanges, so only one account/wallet to acquire Bitcoin) in comparison with others.
So I think chances are high, there are not many more active users than this subreddit has subscribers. Bitcointalk has almost 300,000 users, so that may be a relevant figure too.

Your primary goal should of course be to fuck up as few times as possible, so you should consider if the savings in fees and occasional unjustified chargeback are worth more than your time for manual chargebacks. Most of the time it will be.
regarding  Is this really the case? It seems like VISA or PayPal regulate almost any case in favor of the customer without analyzing the case in depth. If one out of a thousand customers really persists on the claim that you made a huge mistake, it is always quite easy to make up for it (through gifts or other things on the company's expense). These costs will arise one way or the other if you want to run a reputable business. If a customer does a chargeback through a middlemen, he probably won't come back, so you would have to add lost sales to the VISA/Paypal fee.
Of course there are always challenges with innovations, but keeping your customers as close as possible with as low costs as possible is the only way in the long run.

It would be better to define best practices for exchanges and other services and maybe let some entity audit them without trying to enforce anything. Users can decide for themself if they trust an audited exchange in compliance with best practices or the exchange that refuses to act accordingly.
@_date: 2014-08-01 07:28:11
Most merchants are not that fast, though. Widespread merchant adoption (at bigger companies) started a few months ago. To see how much exactly they can pass onto their customers and therefore achieve a competitive advantage, they need to have solid numbers from at least half a year or a year (to reliably calculate lower prices). They would also need a solid userbase paying in Bitcoin and not just 0.1% (giving discount only in Bitcoin outside of promotions could be discriminatory).
@_date: 2014-05-26 19:20:51
Yes, interesting argument. If the gambler does not have any other use for the bitcoin, utility increases if he can gamble. If general utility is the same for any use, I would argue that 100 BTC does not have double the utility as 50 BTC. Depends on perspective of course. As these are life savings, he should refrain from gambling even if the expected outcome is bigger than 50 BTC.
@_date: 2014-10-17 14:44:03
I don't think it will, either and I don't think it will be necessary in the near future. It will take a long time before Bitcoin can compete with existing legal tenders and units of account.

Most of these investments are high risk and high reward, but nobody invests huge amounts in companies expecting them to fail completely. You can't just say that any investment is completely irrelevant because they are expected to fail anyway. By your logic, there is no single business, enterprise or technology that isn't stagnating or dying. We would also have gone through all of the adoption phases in 1-2 years, which is rather unlikely.

What makes Bitcoin so aspiring in the remittance market (for users) is, that it does not really need businesses for transactions that comply with regulation and local laws. Therefore there are no added costs at all, if people decide to send money directly. The only hurdle would be the ability to buy goods and services with Bitcoin locally or switch back to local currency.
Projects like Bitpesa are looking very promising for the start, though and are much cheaper than traditional money transmitters.

Yes, it pretty much is. In most countries you have to declare where your money is from if you purchase higher valued goods. There is no difference in the form of payment. It is not really relevant for everyday goods and it is not the business of Newegg, Overstock or any other merchants. If you buy things with money out of illegal activities you have a problem with IRS/DEA or whatever, not the merchant.

The question only concerns consumers and Bitcoin's role as a currency for spending on goods. Just because you like to spend Bitcoin does not mean you have to transform your debts into Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-05-03 12:40:21
I think it will stabilize as soon as it has enough liquidity and has found an established set of use cases, whatever they will be in the end.
Most of volatile downturns over short periods of time stem from assumptions it will not work as well in the future (closure/failure of popular exchanges or ban in several countries) mixed with low liquidity.
Edit: It would of course only stabilize in the way that it is not more volatile than the use case(s) it is established in. So if Bitcoin is used in emerging and fast changing markets, it will probably stay volatile forever. If it is established as a worldwide store of value, it probably won't grow or decline faster than the worldwide GDP in average.
@_date: 2014-07-16 09:52:20

The rush is over? Did you look at the Hash Rate lately?
@_date: 2014-04-07 11:23:34
The blockchain chart does not really show a significant fall in transactions. If you zoom out (select a longer timeframe) you can see that there is a small downturn of transactions after the bubble deflates (e.g. comparable to July 2013), but it is still higher than a year or even half a year before that in average and the long term uptrend seems to be pretty stable.
What I see in medium term for Bitcoin are many investors/VCs and Wall Street building services/tools/exchanges around Bitcoin to allow for a broader adoption. I think large investors and early players are aware of why they invested in Bitcoin and what it is capable to do, so there is no reason to be afraid that they will cash out and leave at this point.
@_date: 2014-03-24 23:30:34
You are always talking about volume. 2-6% of all Bitcoins in existence get moved daily, not speaking of trades on exchanges. Where's the problem with that?

@_date: 2014-04-30 06:48:06
This would be very interesting to know, especially for merchants considering accepting Bitcoin. IIRC, the first million in revenue / bitcoin transactions is free and the merchants pays a 1% fee for payment processing afterwards. Benefits for the customer are usually subsidized through higher fees and prices. As VISA and others have extremely higher operational costs, you will pay more for your products than you will ever get in benefits.
@_date: 2014-05-14 18:46:33
Yes, those who still want to run the bitcoin network after the attack would need to install that client. Bitcoin was already forked as well as many other cryptocurrencies. Devs and miners/nodes are pretty aware of what to do in that case. Exchanges would also be better off to not accept coins from 51% attacks, so that's another point of why big pools would not want to have more than 50%.
@_date: 2014-02-04 08:40:15
If you think that would be the scenario to expect you are free to act accordingly. This does not influence the Bitcoin protocol or economy in any way. People pannicing and losing their minds (either because of up- or downswing) is worrying me, but I guess that will normalize when the market matures. The outlook for 2014 is still very good, have seen better FUD and trolls around in the past.
@_date: 2014-10-12 10:01:24
This is why I could never bring myself to use my credit card for smaller, less trusted merchants. It was always cash or credit card at Amazon &amp; co.

@_date: 2014-03-27 11:01:32
Yes, very good point. Tools to verify and transact Bitcoins are (by far) more common than tools to verify fiat cash. There is barely any spot in the western world where you do not have an internet connection at least with your mobile in combination with merchants selling goods. And this is getting even better in the rest of the world with all the communication satellites and cable/fiber laid out. So in the long term, Bitcoin transactions are getting safer and easier and the (last) advantage of cash falls with people getting connected.
@_date: 2014-01-16 12:44:41
What did you buy and where?
@_date: 2014-03-05 14:17:45
Yes, you wouldn't even have to sacrifice much time, as a trade is basically a contract for a price. The transaction can follow after that. I don't think most people would sell the same day they bought.

Yes, most altcoins seem to be created to make money/speculate and not to solve a specific problem. I don't think there is a future for altcoins that are only created for that (or to scam users/investors).

Adoption for merchants, the remittance market and as a payment system and investment in general is in huge favor for Bitcoin.

It is not idiotic but rather an useless business standard of valuation.
For most use cases concerning the network you would have to consider those coins that are easily available for the market.

AFAIK, it is a sealed-bid auction and the USMS is not obliged to publish winners and their bids (just like any other auction for confiscated goods).

Considering the 1% for Bitcoin (which clearly comes from Coinbase as Ehrsam is featured in the report), I think it is a fair compromise. A merchant could theoretically have almost no fees at all, but may be in a riskier situation (by not converting or not using a payment processor).
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:15:31
The market cap is 1% of Bitcoin's market cap right now and due to price/demand flexibility less than that would be added to the price of Bitcoin if all holders decided to sell.

Could you condemn Bitcoin if you understand the technology and its implication? I doubt that. It may have risks and drawbacks but saying the idea of a distribution of wealth on a decentralized, public ledger isn't worth anything is pretty idiotic or driven by some agenda.

Absolutely, an investment in Bitcoin came with a lot more risk at inception as there was no economy, no exchanges besides MtGox (which lost coins before) and some hacks and hard forks. The future looks much better for Bitcoin than at inception. Of course, you may not get millions out of a $10 investment anymore, but it still may be a very interesting investment. And after all, building a substantial amount of wealth may be more interesting than a high ROI. You can still brag about how much you made out of the $100 a few years ago.

Me neither. What happened is completely irrelevant to what the market looks like. A free market could have eliminated some of the threats and attacks Gox faced in the past, though.

I chose this analogy because, just like the stock exchange, the only theoretical influence of a Bitcoin exchange is its support in the price finding mechanism. If one stock exchange closes (hypothetical, I know this does not happen) you would be free to sell your stock at another exchange or keep it anywhere you want.
Most people should know by now to not keep their Bitcoins in exchanges when they are not actively trading.
As far as I remember MtGox was pretty dominant in volume a year ago, could be false though.

The only real reason to wait for a specific amount of confirmations at these hashrates is to make sure that no entity is able to conduct 51% attacks.
Race attacks or other forms of double spends are pretty hard to do in everyday situations, once the transaction reaches a high propagation throughout the network (usually in seconds, independent of confirmations).

That's a good question. You could ask why anyone would need silver as a store of value instead of Gold or Mastercard as a payment processor instead of VISA. In cryptocurrencies the only reason to prefer one copy of Bitcoin over the other or over the original is branding, nothing else.

In short term this may be the case, if merchant adoption motivates holders to spend more than they would spend anyway. Merchants do not dump anything, though. All the coins are going to the payment processors, who can sell those coins.

Yes, besides questionable financial benefits from an attack (double earnings over a limited timeframe and the ability to short Bitcoin, hoping the exchange allows you to cash out), your post shows why not only the community wants mining to be as decentralized (and anonymous) as possible, but also mining pool operators who could face those attack vectors against themselves.

Hashrate distribution is not a new issue, though. We already had pools with about 50% or more.
@_date: 2014-05-14 15:37:35
Yes, 51% attacks are a threat to the network. There always will be attack vectors. But as operations get bigger and more profitable, have a lot more liabilities and sunk costs in assets, they are less likely to misbehave or attack the network they feed on.
It will always be important to fragment the hashing power to a certain degree, but a pool approaching 40% is not always a reason to get in panic.

Most people don't even have or use credit cards and most merchants (and retailers) will probably never accept credit cards. So the biggest part of the world can jump this gap (cash-&gt;Cryptocurrency) directly to easier and cheaper payment.

The coins moved and sold by the bearwhale were not very old, though. There are also many people and institutions outside of the bitcoin exchanges that could accumulate that amount easily. Early adopters cashing out or not does not really change anything.
@_date: 2014-05-02 07:21:20
The advantage for any merchant is to be able to accept Bitcoin without any big investment and development. You would have to train support a bit and maybe restructure payments a little, but you do not have to pay for development, network security and hashing, electricity and Hardware. All of this is outsourced and comes for free. Any company that decides to issue their own currency would have to build that up on their own and hope anyone accepts their currency.
The other thing we could already observe at Bitcoin/Cryptocurrency is that just gifting something to people does not make them users. People download wallets and buy Bitcoin before merchants accept it. So by gifting every amazon customer a little amount, you may have a lot less users than there are in Bitcoin.

Because Bitcoin does not pay taxes and bills, yet. For most business owners, it is easier to transact through Bitpay and Coinbase. Everyone else has wallets showing them that there is a double spend or how high the confidence is.
The problem is solved by the network, for those who know how to use it, and by service providers (Bitpay and Coinbase are only two examples) for the others.

Yes, of course they won't magically turn the price into 10 grand but they are building the infrastructure that could host a corresponding network.
In my opinion the most profit they could get with the first wave of investments is to build competitive services in:
1) payment systems (Online/Brick-and-mortar)
2) Investment and storage of value (mainly through ETFs or improved exchanges/wallets)
3) Remittance and international money transfers (e.g. Bitpesa, converting Bitcoin into local currency)
Investors could profit from each transactions in these areas and benefit from a growing network and bigger market capitalizations and from a lot of people pumping their money into and through the market.

The USD inflation is much higher if you ignore money that hasn't moved since 2012. Besides that, supply in Bitcoin is common knowledge, programmed and calculatable.
@_date: 2014-05-09 17:15:51
You are not the one who puts the price on it.
If you bring the minimum $5 argument on the table (minimum by Bitstamp), you would need to convince an exchange to accept your coin there so anyone can trade their dollar/cents for it. In best case, fees and minimum investments will be comparable to Bitcoin, but likely higher.
@_date: 2014-03-18 08:39:22

Yes, SWIFT was the last big thing in international payments and was founded 41 years ago. That is why I am talking of decades. While it works perfectly right now, the network might be ripe for the next step (in the direction of cryptocurrency) soon.
The market for local payment solutions is so saturated from mediocre solutions (there are tons of mobile payment systems that nobody uses) that there will no clear competitor for "traditional" systems for some time. It is still interesting to see how many merchants and service providers are already accepting Bitcoin, while mainstream merchant adoption would be one of the last steps for general Bitcoin adoption in my mind.

What problem? If no single operator has control over 51%, there is no problem. Ghash achieves that by redirecting hashing power to other pools.

So what you are saying is that the bubble is over and we will see a steady, sustainable growth until the next one?
@_date: 2014-06-23 09:35:19
Estimates like that are pure speculation and there is no single piece of evidence for such claims, so you should be very cautious here. On the other hand, officially reported data suggests GHash's share to be lower than the amount of found blocks. It is a problem nonetheless.
The only solution that could be implemented now are software based and may not lead away from centralization (e.g. that article pleading for a hard fork).
Considering competition and new players entering the mining market, I do not see a possible solution to mining without a significant increase in price. Once it goes back into the profitable area and generates enough awareness and acceptance, semiconductor producers may ensure a proper decentralization (comparable to their market shares right now in their core business).

Ask them one question:
Should the fear of devaluation of your money be a motivator to buy goods and services?
Most people should answer this with No. 
Additionally, you see your purchasing power increasing with higher prices and are able to buy more with your investment (we have already seen that people tend to spend more on goods when they think the price is rising and high).
If they are still not convinced you can tell them that the system is comparable to gold, where nobody complains because they are used to it (neither gold nor Bitcoin are deflationary btw), but Bitcoin can be stored easier everywhere and transported and transacted around the world and you can actually buy goods and services with it.

Yes, many stores have big signs outside/near the counter, stating that bigger notes are not allowed.
Legal tender is only notes and coins, correct.

I can't, but I would argue that people that are worth a few millions can control what they do with their money up to a certain degree. Selling 10k BTC at once on a sunday (with low volume and active traders) pushes the price down much further than selling smaller batches or on a day with higher volume and more active traders. If you just wanted to cash out, you would have to wait for a weekday for your bank to open anyway. There is just no other rational argumentation for someone to throw 10k BTC at an exchange other than to manipulate the price through artificial selling pressure.

Of course, nothing is free. Banks have a lot of employees, rent payments, operational and other costs that have to be paid one way or the other. That's a pretty inefficient system for payments in the long run (although my bank does not have brick-and-mortar branches).
Payments get booked out of my account as soon as I press send, so maybe it takes a day or two for them to arrive at the recipient's bank account. The bank does not have a public ledger to follow that through. ;)

The most likely scenario at the current stage would be Bitpay and Coinbase liquidating most of the Bitcoin sold through merchants pretty quickly, leading to a limited downwards pressure in short term. 
Assuming consistent figures, they provide almost the same supply to the market as miners on a daily basis (Bitpay speaks of $1m/day, Coinbase probably comparable).
In the mid and long term there probably will be consumers rebuying the same amount or more Bitcoin than they spend (through increased certainty in Bitcoin's success) and new users getting their feets wet and experimenting with buying things with Bitcoin or choosing it as an investment.
If merchants closed the loop (holding Bitcoin and pay their supplier with it) this would take away the initial downward pressure and enforce the following upward pressure.

I didn't have time to look into the masternode system, but it may be a centralization to a few points of failure in the long run. I would not put too much trust in that.
Longer confirmation times are mostly a good thing, as they lead to less blockchain bloat and less orphaned blocks and do not really lower the level of security, as attacks on networks with a high hashrate depend on the factor of time and not on confirmations.

I didn't remove the local currency. I said (almost) free with Bitcoin and 3% incl. delivery of local currency.
No currency, commodity of property ever invented by mankind gives you protection from anything. If you insist on consumer protection, you will surely find a service offering that soon. Meanwhile, Bitcoin is the only system in the world, where the seller can be sure to get the money from anywhere in the world before the goods leave his warehouse. But I guess this is not relevant at all.
There are merchants that see usage/adoption for this specific use case. I don't really see where you get that from. Maybe you should read up on Bitpay's numbers.

IIRC, Apple has plans for an own mobile payment system, where you can pay with your phone everywhere. This would be a competitor to Google Wallet, which does not use an own currency either. Implementing/allowing Bitcoin for a payment system is a lot cheaper and maximizes profits in relation to creating and maintaining an own currency.
@_date: 2014-03-24 18:33:22
Targeted ads to people with money is a really big thing, I would agree with that. They know how much money you got and usually send and what you buy with that. That would be a very valuable database.
I recently saw a report about the dangers of NFC + Credit Cards and how Google Wallet and other push-payment services circumvent that, so that's another pro for Google (and Bitcoin).
Smaller loyalty rewards or cashbacks are nothing that would draw Investors in, but rather something for the casual user or people that love to consume much.
I personally think, Google Wallet will not crush Bitcoin, but will be a competitor in smaller payments or regular small purchases (coffee, Snacks etc.) at POS. There are already a lot of competitors in this field, Google Wallet will be one of the best.
Considering Bitcoin's fee system: this can probably be solved by allowing more transactions per second in the future, so miners can do more transactions and make more money of it.

As you can see with Bitcoin, indications of future adoption ("good news") do not really influence the price or the demand right now. Stellar will grow as soon as people buy in (if the demand/supply mechanism is comparable with Bitcoin), although it seems like the currency can be produced at will without mining, so the price will likely be stabilized by Stripe or others.

That is the answer to the deflationary aspect. Under the assumption that the economy accepting Bitcoin is growing faster than the supply of Bitcoins the price for each one has to rise. The merchant will be willing to accept Bitcoin (which has less fees for him) for a discount and you can recharge your holdings immediately, leaving a win-win situation for both.
I have not come across a store accepting Bitcoin here, so I would have to wait for a bigger merchant adoption.

So at first you say if history repeats itself, Bitcoin will not rise again. When pointing out that Bitcoiners can point to historical data where the price evolved exactly as the last weeks/months, you say history does not mean much? What is it?
The reasons why Bitcoiners believe in the technology (if we leave the fundamental advantages und utilities aside) is the constant and sometimes exponential growth of hashrate, user count, transactions etc.
On the other hand, why would anyone actually think that Bitcoin will not rise further? Do you have any non-speculative reason you do not grab out of thin air?

Agree, that number is way too small if you look at the huge incompetency big banks have demonstrated in the last years, throwing away everyones money.
Financial products based on the Blockchain/Bitcoin protocol would be usable everywhere in the world from everyone, virtually free of charge. No chance for banks to survive in that sector in the long run.
Also, paying 3% fee on a credit card purchase when you have a profit margin of 6% (that is huge in retail sector where I come from) means your profits are halved when your customers use credit cards and the data gets stolen pretty often.

Why should anyone trust the banks to flag money launderers, that are known to have cooperated with them in the past?
@_date: 2014-04-11 09:32:04
Exactly. Waiting 10 minutes in the store to get confirmation for your Bitcoin payment would be like waiting 30 days in the store to get a credit card confirmation.
@_date: 2014-05-31 23:45:29
Fine, make it 3.1-3.5%.
The only consumer protection credit cards offer and Bitcoin can't are chargebacks during the time of confirmation. If you want to sell slow transactions on a huge cost basis and high uncertainty (they can block anyone they don't like), go on and do it. No one will buy it, once this becomes clear.
Both the numbers of Bitpay and the investments of VCs who recently put money into Bitpay (I am pretty sure they know more about the number than you and me) and other Bitcoin related enterprises support the position that Bitcoin is about to cross the chasm.

According to [Bitcoincharts]( (seems to be a bit old, as MtGox is still on there), Bitstamp (+Bitfinex, which mostly trades on Bitstamp) currently is the volume leader for Bitcoin trades.

@_date: 2014-07-10 08:34:03
I didn't dig to much into the Realcoin proposal but as I understand it, it mirrors all of the USD exchanged for realcoin on the blockchain, correct?
This would allow for easy implementation of direct exchanges, where anyone could follow their money and noone could create money through code (like they did at MtGox). But this also assumes that exchanges are implemented correctly, MtGox's problem was that it was programmed very poorly and not audited at all. Exchanges really need audits, best practices and even a bit of regulation (to identify bad actors at least).
The problem that still stands is: How do you exchange USD for realcoin? Doesn't this need an exchange, too? Doesn't this pose exactly the same risk as for Bitcoin exchanges? I do not really see how this solves anything, yet.
My proposal would be an incentive to create trustworthy exchanges and brokers, where you exchange your currency directly (e.g. SEPA between exchange partners) instead of storing them on a central bank account of the exchange and use the exchange as an escrow.

IIRC, he even corrected his initial expectations to the number of 10-15 millions after the first days of sales (I think it was 5 million at the beginning).
If it keeps growing, 1% is not absolutely out of reach but we will see after the year is over. It has been a bit over 4 months now, so almost 8 to go.
Edit: Bittime just posted the video source. Accepting Bitcoin is the perfect payment system if he plans to expand internationally and gets a lot of people from other countries to pay in Bitcoin. No chargebacks, bank/cc fraud and faster access to the client's money. So it is absolutely understandable from Byrne's perspective to pump Bitcoin as much as possible.

Bitcoin could replace fiat as the currency of use, but the government decides what is used as a legal tender (in most jurisdiction you would be obliged to settle debts and pay taxes in the local currency until the government allows otherwise). No government would allow Bitcoin as a legal tender until it is absolutely sure of what that implies for their economy. However, I think we are at least a decade away from that problem becoming relevant (assuming Bitcoin succeeds and will be adopted broadly). All the markets that are build now (from Wall Street to Bitpay and remittances) are not really relevant for the status quo of today's economies.

It was treated wrong from the start, if somebody really wanted to do something about Iceland's economy and Aurora as a national currency. This is not more than a marketing scheme to pump the price for premined scam coins and it is very effective. For a national currency you would go a completely different way, not really allowing profit. Until then, Bitcoin is the best for most purposes.

I know there could and probably will be a bit of a panic, but shutdown of an exchange is not really that dramatic. Would bounce back on track faster than it crashes. No reason to get coins out of cold storage.

1+3. Maybe, but you need something significantly better than Bitcoin to get people that are interested in Cryptocurrency and Bitcoin to switch. Not every person would jump to get a stake in Amacoin, especially as it is from Amazon. Most people would use the $5 as a gift card and go on with their normal lifes. 1% is extremely optimistic, yes. I don't think more people than that would ever invest in a cryptocurrency that you only could use on Amazon (at the beginning). A lot of people already get Amazon Coins for free but don't use them.
2+4. Amazon would have to develop ASICs for their network and make sure difficulty and hash rate is as high as possible at start. Imagine people mining Amacoin for a few cents and buying good for $5 and up. Amazon would go bankrupt in a month. This is an extreme financial risk. Amazon is not in the position to guarantee prices. They would need a partner with billions in cash reserves and everyone who has that is aware of how terrible that idea is.
5 Which altcoin can be used just like Bitcoin anywhere? You need merchants to actively implement wallets/software and accept every altcoin seperately. And no merchant would actively accept something coming from Amazon as they are far from popular with other merchants. Overstock &amp; most others would rather go bankrupt than support Amazon in any way.
And as any merchants would have huge expenses for development and network security, creating your own altcoin is not the rational way to improve your financial situation if you could just accept Bitcoin.
The US government already came out pretty much in favor of Bitcoin and there will be the first licensed and regulated exchanges in July, together with other services. Funny enough, Bitcoin is going the same way as Facebook right now, spreading in a highly networked community soon (MIT).

I would agree that Bitcoin does not have a huge direct utility for consumers, if only used for commerce, at the current stage (assuming you will not hunt for Bitcoin discounts). Most of the incentives are rather long-term and indirect.
One thing that is often mentioned here and in other places when it comes to criticism of Bitcoin is the lack in consumer protection. Did you ask him what he sees as consumer protection. There is a lot of misunderstanding about this term leading to a terrible consumer protection situation, especially in the USA.

Exactly. And now, I do not have to pay for services I do not wish to use and I do not need anymore.
A machine checking and verifying transactions, amounts and prohibiting fraud will always be better, faster and cheaper than a human being. Even with billions in operating costs and all of their services, credit card operators, Paypal and banks have a lot of problems with that. Insurances and reimbursements can not be long-term solutions to that.

Ok, sounds logical. But most pools, if not all, consist of independent miners that point their hashing power to the pool. Ghash.io claims to own 45% of the pool's power themselves and to get the rest from other miners who could leave their sphere of influence immediately. Their business model would also be severly damaged by any form of attack related to Ghash.

These numbers are very hard to find, if not impossible. The BoA report fails to report these numbers but assumes the B2C e-commerce to be around $1 trillion yearly, as the USA is roughly 20% of the world's GDP.
B2B Business seems to be a lot higher than that, as China's B2B transactions alone hit [$466.7 Billion]( in 2012. You could try to extrapolate that in relation to their share of worldwide GDP (11%)
To get a feeling of how much money is transferred globally between private persons, you may look at the remittance market which was [$529 Billion]( in 2012.

Most altcoins do not add any new features to cryptocurrencies. They may have a different hash algorithm or a different count of total units or designed the way of sending or confirming differently, but there are no implications deriving from that for real world applications. As long as an altcoin is not significantly different than Bitcoin, there is no need to use or trade it as Bitcoin is already *somewhat* established and has a strong and growing network and user base.
Most people that play around with altcoins or are dazzled by features and promises therefore will merge to Bitcoin eventually.
@_date: 2014-05-14 08:03:10
The Bitcoin network has a lot more hashing power (in petaflops) than the top 500 computers in the world:
Bitcoin Network: [805738 Petaflops](
Top 500: [250 Petaflops](
As long as they don't get their hands on more ASICs than the network is running there is no risk at all of them being somewhere near the 51%.

Outsourcing of costs and risk to the Bitcoin network, for a fee that is infinitely smaller than the costs for employees that control the transactions during their working hours and better accountability of transactions (fiat money does not even have a protocol or an standardized ledger for that).

Hoarding will also occur at merchants IF they can be sure of a deflationary effect, so merchants would prefer Bitcoins over any other currency.
To get Bitcoins instead of Dollars, they would offer a steep discount on their goods, knowing the value will rise in the future.
So you can buy goods with your Bitcoins for a discount, buy new ones immediately and you and the merchants enjoy the deflationary effect.
If Bitcoin is deflationary, it means: You get cheap goods, the merchants gets cheap coins.

That is true, although insurance by far is not the only factor. Savings rate is higher in countries with a traditional long-term orientation in savings and risk aversion in private investing (e.g. Germany, Norway or China). Investments also do not fall under any insurance. Deposits are only insured as deposits on a bank account, not as a stock, bond or any other investments. Many people (especially here in Germany) keep their money in their bank account because they think it is much safer there, so I don't think deposit insurance helps the economy to grow (but is important for the regular population to feel safe).

That's the case with every bubble in Bitcoin. The price builds up on developments in the economy throughout the last months and shoots up way to high to be supported (even leading to crashes because of high volume).

I think CEX.io is one of the more trustworthy cloud mining providers.
Posts about them are not negative because you may get scammed or ripped off (although I heard they were overpriced), but because they directly contribute to GHash's hashrate and therefore you directly invest into their growth.

How long would you take for those few questions and why is it not possible to be all-negative or all-positive? I think this would be more realistic than mixed answers as negative psychological effects on yourself may lead to negative effects on relations to your peers.
You should also include a few more questions to allow for some foundation for psychological effects and causation (age, gender, country, time and depth the person is involved in Bitcoin, maybe even the price they bought as you constantly preach that everyone lost at least 50% irretrievably).

Are credit card information really worth nothing anymore? Americans seem to be open to give anyone their name, address and credit card number just because they are able to do a chargeback. Not surprising that half of the world's credit card fraud is done in the USA.

Most of them sound pretty bitter and horribly misinformed. I doubt that many of those make money from the markets, although there surely are a few.


Doesn't sound that bad, considering at what early stage Bitcoin still is. 600k out of 14k after 3 years is not bad. Of course there are always people that gamble away or tend to make bad decisions, but that's nothing new with Bitcoin. You can't ignore though that a rising market capitalization is leading to rising wealth of individuals involved.

Sorry, that is not how a Ponzi scheme works. The public ledger makes it harder than with other currencies, where you have to bribe the bank employees to look away.
How is your definition of that scheme any different than any stock (especially IPOs), commodity or currency? This can be applied to almost every single market.
Edit: Also, you shouldn't listen (and don't have to) to other people trying to influence your decision. At the end of the day, everyone is somewhat greedy and does not want to lose his money. That is why you will hear to not sell or buy more in any market and even more in markets that have seen a growth like in Bitcoin.

You can not design a cryptocurrency that is not used by criminals, you can not design a cryptocurrency that is safe of theft by itself and easier to understand.

1. Yes, but what is the difference to Amazon coins, gift cards or regular purchases? Does that really motivate anyone to buy more from Amazon?
2. Ok, your text says ownership goes back to amazon. So it is an amazon gift voucher for $5, but people can pay more if they become scarce? edit: Someone with a lot of hashing power could generate millions of amacoins and sell them to Amazon for at least $5? That sounds extremely exploitable.
3. There already have been many experiments with fair mining and distribution in the cryptocurrency community (look them up in the bitcointalk forums). The point is that regular people would likely not start to mine amacoins if they did not already mine other cryptocurrency. And then it is just a calculation of difficulty vs. profitability through sale for Bitcoin.

The payment system should not solve consumer protection issues. This is what governments are elected for. Potential bad actors should be eliminated **before** they get paid. But as the USA is a third world country in those aspects and most of credit card frauds are done in the USA, it is understandable that poorly educated people would call chargeback a consumer protection.
If you really want to implement those kinds of measures, nothing stops you in the Bitcoin economy. If you look at how chargebacks work, they could operate faster, easier and cheaper on Bitcoin.

The only problem would be to find enough people to sell you their Bitcoin for $500 each and to keep up with the demand.
With a fixed price you can send any amount of money around the world for a few cents (or for free), which would empty your reserves pretty quickly. You may achieve to buy them back though, but prices would probably skyrocket anyway. Interesting thought experiment, but also shows exactly why Bitcoin's price can't and won't be fixed.

By achieving a high propagation of your transaction in seconds. Once all nodes have seen your transaction you can not reverse it anymore, no matter how high your fee is.

Bitpay has done tens of thousands of zero confirmation transactions in 2013 and didn't see a single double spend. No need to raise the fees.

It wouldn't be very wise to sell them on an exchange, neither for him (money wise) nor for the project. As there is an investor willing to buy the 144k BTC from the FBI completely, he may be better off selling them to another investor or Secondmarket/Coinbase.

8mbps is for a network rate comparable to VISA (2000tps), so 300 times today's maximum capacity. I think it will be a few years until we can start to dream of that.
At current status 8mbps is a third of the average household bandwidth and I do not think there is a miner with considerable impact on the network's hashrate that would call 8mbps significant, considered you pay less than a $ per mbps in most parts of the world.

This is not up to Amazon. You would have to convince everyone to accept gift vouchers created by Amazon, who control issue und pricing of them. By your approach Amazon would not be able to adopt any advantages of Bitcoin besides encryption and hashing, maybe.

I do not really see a problem with that. In the beginning, Silk Road and other darknet platforms hat a marketshare of &gt;10%, so it is not the first time that these numbers of Bitcoins are in hands of criminals or thieves. It does not really influence the economy as a whole.

What if the government finds people doing a lot of illegal stuff with Amacoins? Amazon would at least be obliged to report every single transaction to the government and identify every user and their balances, if they somehow can lobby their way out of closure by the government.
Also, what would stop the government from starting its own cryptocurrency and prohibit others from doing so? With Amazon obliged to monitor and report every single movement by identified customers, Amazon is just a redundant layer for the government. They could make their own and force it down everyone's throat as a legal tender.

Europeans usually also do not buy their coffee with a credit card, either. It is mostly cash for smaller transaction, especially retail and gastronomy. Nobody needs to give them bank or credit card details and they do not have to pay transaction fees.

Considering companies working with Bitcoin, most likely. Every new technology or market tends to be overvalued. If they fail to deliver stable returns long-term, they will crash. Everything looks good for now, though.
On the other hand, the internet itself never really crashed in user base or number of services/nodes etc.

Do we know anything more then that the Blockchain app was “removed from the App Store due to an unresolved issue.”?
@_date: 2014-06-14 18:07:21
Sure. According to Falcon Global's [website]( they plan to raise $100,000,000 in Bitcoin in 2014 alone (which would be &gt;175,000 BTC at current prices) and Stapper [offered]( before to buy all of the 27,000 BTC from the FBI. 
You can see on [Bitcointalk]( that SecondMarket is buying bigger batches of Bitcoin regularly (already amassing 106404 BTC today) and IIRC Barry Silbert said that it gets harder to buy BTC from early adopters/innovators (I can not find a link to that statement, though). With their [plans]( to open a regulated exchange and ETF for everyone this summer or fall, I guess they would need a lot more BTC than they already have in stock. 
These are just the information I had on the top of my mind. I guess if you research further, you may find more institutional or wealthy investors trying to take a bigger position in Bitcoin and this is why I think there is no chance for the Bitcoins that will be auctioned off to reach one of the exchanges, but will rather lead investors that did not get any at the auction to unload their fiat on the open markets.

Your history says a month. Bitcoin was at $900 at January.
But to answer your question: a lot of uncertainty due to rumors and reports about ban of banks and payment processors to transact Bitcoin related business in China, the downfall of MtGox and the IRS ruling also may have influenced the exchange price.
But after all, just the normal phases of a bubble cycle.

IIRC, the spam transactions from 1enjoy and 1sochi have been ignored by miners (almost every single user had multiple transactions of those on his address) as they have been 1 Satoshi and didn't have a fee.
I don't think miners can choose which transactions to include and which not, so owning less than 51% of the hashrate wouldn't help them.
Pumping unlimited funds into Bitcoin would have a lot of newly rich people with enough capital to fund a workaround, though.

You should also consider that there are two different kinds of market share Bitcoin is attacking. It only takes away market share from fiat when goods and services are paid in Bitcoin directly, while it takes away marketshare from payment processors like VISA when paid through Bitpay/Coinbase.

I do not count myself to that group, just to make that clear.
I absolutely agree that shareholder/investors and employees should be held responsible to that actions of the banks to a certain degree before the taxpayer has to pay anything.
Where I would draw the line is the possibility to draw money from depositors and private accounts. This may be helpful in certain cases but opens a box of pandora and may allow for bail-ins for many other reasons. I am absolutely against making depositors suffer from bank failures, irresponsible behaviour, fraud etc.

It is absolutely possible to do that in Bitcoin, if there is enough liquidity and the necessary infrastructure (nothing in the protocol would prohibit loans/mortgages etc.) and a more stable price and ecosystem.

Yes, that is a good point. Bitcoin adds another vector here, though.
With a fisher boat (that you paid for) you would fish as much as you can to get the highest profit possible, paying off your boat multiple times with that amount.
In Bitcoin, there is a huge arms race in mining. You need to profit as much as possible to be able to buy new hardware and keep your market share. If your market share gets too big, your hardware (that is not amortized) may be completely useless and your future income is completely gone. There is an incentive to get a market share as high as possible, but it could damage your bussiness if it gets too high.
As hashrate and GHash's marketshare is currently decreasing, they seem to think the same way.

Therefore, Google could amass more Bitcoin by just accepting and hoarding them then by trying to mine themselves.

A) If you want to support the currency and Bitcoin itself, the price does not really matter. An entry almost 50% below the ATH is not the worst point of entry, though.

I brought the paper wallets in as a comparison to something tangible in a fixed nominations (e.g 1, 5 or 10 BTC) comparable to cash notes.

Directly contact Coinbase or Secondmarket, they are always looking for bigger sums of Bitcoin and will work out a way for you.
Selling 1,000 BTC at an exchange will give you less US$ than with a fixed price and you don't need to take the risk of meeting with people from Localbitcoins.

I didn't say that it will certainly reach that number, but that it is not impossible, *assuming* Bitcoin grows to get a bigger userbase that wants to shop at Overstock. I completely understand that it won't reach that if sales stay low as they allegedly were in the last week, so I fully agree with you here.
I just edited my post. Pumping Bitcoin, especially for international sales, may be advantageous for Overstock's overseas business as they directly get their customer's money before the product leaves their storage.

[This guy]( wants to buy 27,000 BTC for example, which is about $13.5 million. The Winklevii and SecondMarket also would need more Bitcoin for their ETFs, Secondmarket bought &gt;7800 this month alone (now holding more than 100,000 BTC).
We surely need these Bitcoin to reach the open market for more liquidity, but the demand is and will be much higher than that once the auction is scheduled.

Yeah, I guess. The decline in price certainly does not seem to come from a decline in demand, situation is comparable on other exchanges (still pretty high accumulation), but looks to be contributed to uncertainty and panic (which certainly exists on Gox right now).

Intrinsic value means it gives something a value for it's own sake. In relation to humans it is something that is desirable for itself. Mostly philosophical/ethical concepts or basic needs. There is nothing in the financial world that has any intrinsic value according to the philosophical or ethical definition.
There is a financial definition of intrinsic value, famous for being implemented by Warren Buffett. Basically, it describes the ability of an entity to create cashflow in relation to its net worth.

Technically, as these transactions are from one bank to another, you shouldn't expect any problems.
AFAIK, a bank in the EU has to report any transaction over €15,000 according to [Wikipedia]( although it is talking about cash deposits there.

That's far away from their core business and you improve your business and your profits by outsourcing any process that does not belong to your core business.

That's mainly to the fact that the term "inflation" can be used in completely different connections.

This, exactly. Through cameras they can connect the payment to your car and to you directly. You can not only never go there again to fill up on gas, you will be now and searched for because of your fraud.

They could save transaction costs without a big investment, assuming they are paying more than 1% now and get a little marketing/sales boost much bigger than Overstock.

Iceland decided not to print more money, but to let the banks go bankrupt. Their crash went a little harder, but recovery was much healthier.
I still do not see any need for central banks controlling (and watering down) wealth that does not belong to them.
Anyway, nice to see that Prof. Bitcorn's (as a hardcore defender of central banks) image of Bitcoin changes slowly from "It crashes to $10 and is going to die" to "the assumption we do not need a central bank is wrong".

Yes, Amazon would probably need to train their staff for that, so they do not have to rely on other companies for support, but I do not think that support costs will be higher in relation to those of traditional payments and as a average Bitcoin purchase on Overstock was more than double (in price) than a normal purchase, variable support costs may be way below those of other payment methods.
BTW, do you have any figures about which fees Amazon does pay for CCs? I guess they are not publicly available, but as they try to push their own CC, it may be higher than they really want it to be.
Coinbase or Bitpay could also be very flexible here and drastically reduce their fee per purchase for bigger clients, so I highly doubt there would be financial drawbacks from accepting Bitcoin.

It basically shows the relation of supply and demand ([Investopedia](

As SEPA transfers throughout Europe are free and pretty quick (mostly on the same day if before 4pm on a work day), not much really.
The only advantages I see yet are privacy (through a SEPA transfer you give away your full name and bank account number, allowing for theft of identity and fraudulent transactions with your account) and convenience (although that is diminished by the hassle of buying Bitcoin).

Yes, I am a bit surprised how well and fast Bitcoin is accepted at merchants. Overstock was the first billion-dollar-company and that was just 6 months ago.
The number of users and consumers is steadily growing, which you can see in registered wallets (e.g. Coinbase requires ID, so no significant amount of multiple wallets), although store of value and outsourcing of transactions to the network may be an even bigger opportunity in the medium term. So you can see that it is pretty obvious what you will add next year to your sentence:

Yes, this is the reason why the Telekom and communication monopolies in general are not really popular. They are barely able to stay competitive even with billions in state subsidies. I was referring to growing number of fiber users, though. Using fiber makes much more sense if you need high speed and a lot of data. I don't think anyone who wants to run a full node would choose a Telekom DSL package here. So there is still no limit, especially not in the low terabyte region.

Bitcoin does not and did never promise returns. In fact, the only thing people got from investing early is apprecation of value in their holdings. A ponzi needs returns (aka interest and dividend payments). There is no such thing in Bitcoin. If you think a decentralized, open ledger has no use at all the bigger fool theory is what you are looking for. Stating Bitcoin is a ponzi and afterwards arguing about its current competitiveness as a local retail payment system and mixing up legal tender and store of value makes you look like a total fool. This may also be the reason why you are "downvoted to hell".

Theory is that by the time the block rewards are going to zero, transaction fees will be the main source of income. The single incentive to let the machines run will be to confirm transactions and collect the fees. As most attacks aim to get the block rewards for themselves, those will be irrelevant by then and keeping the number of transactions as high as possible is desirable.
The last single Bitcoin will be mined over a course of over 30 years: 
I guess the machines will be efficient enough to keep the network at a profit, but nobody on here will probably be alive to witness it.

First of all: Bitcoin confiscated by the FBI will be auctioned off and this will be openly scheduled beforehand. They are not sold on exchanges directly.
We can not be sure of actions of other players, but the general consensus is that the downwards trend is slowly coming to an end (although there are chances that it goes further down) as lower volatility and volume is a sign for the end of a trend.

The same goes for bank payments or any other direct transactions. There is no monetary system that allows for reversion of transactions or chargebacks. Everything we see today are third-party service providers that hold your money for at least a month and allow to credit that money back to your account for that time or banks cooperating to allow a payment back to your account. The only difference with Bitcoin is the current lack (or presence) of comparable service providers.
The reversibility/chargeback discussion is not more than a red herring.

Yes, rewards are halving every 210000 Blocks, which leads to 34 block rewards eras in total. In the last era, miners have to share a single Satoshi every 10 minutes together with transaction fees.
The time it takes for halving and reaching a new era of block rewards is regulated by difficulty, so it is pretty much fixed.

It isn't at zero yet but using Quark instead of Bitcoin only brings drawbacks to any party involved.
Through extremely low hashrate, there is no real network security. It would probably be very easy to attack the network (more algorithms make it harder, but not by very much).
The low market capitalization and liquidity (almost no trading volume) do not allow for any significant real world applications.
The pumpers are gone or have new altcoins (e.g. maxcoin), so the upside may be very limited for the speculative side.
After all, if you do not bring anything new to the table (different algorithms or blocktimes are nothing special but can lead to problems), there is only one. Bitcoin is already there and is growing fast, there is no need to implement the same type of cryptocurrency with a different name (and an own, weak blockchain).
The Highlander mentality is important especially for cautious investors and supporters of cryptocurrencies as a lot of altcoins turned out as scam or wastes of money and time.

Of course not. You would lose purchasing power over time (just like with holding $500) and Bitcoin's utility would be severely limited in the long run.
Edit: On second thought, it would have a huge utility for instant worldwide money transfer but would be bound to a limited market capitalization. How could anyone decide who gets the honor to be able to hold Bitcoin? The price would skyrocket immediately.

Why would you choose to spend Dogecoin when it is much easier to spend Bitcoin due to higher adoption at merchants (Dogecoin transactions died off after the initial pump by Wolong and others)?
Why would you invest in Litecoin when all it does is follow Bitcoin, but has higher risk of being abandoned or hacked/manipulated?
Bitcoin is not perfect, but the best we have right now and is still constantly developed (with Litecoin, Dogecoin and the others implenting some of the developments afterwards).

Yes, I would agree here. The only way to estimate that I am currently aware of is to ask payment providers and merchants how many Bitcoin transactions they had. (e.g. there were statistics from Bitpay and the million dollar sales of Overstock etc.)
Most of the speculative transactions (trades on exchanges) are not on the Blockchain anyway, therefore total number of transactions (in combination with average worth of transaction) can be used as an indicator of economical activity.

Well you could use it for debt, but it is a currency, which adjusts to the economy behind it and does not devalue with such an enormous speed as fiat currencies, making debts easily payable for most because of Inflation. The blockchain is surely useful to document debt, but it is better for debtor for debts to be issued in highly inflationary currency. But just because debt based financial products are not yet imaginable in bitcoin does not render it any less useful. In my opinion that would be the last step to become the world currency, if that should ever happen. Companies are also encouraged to build up reserves, which would be a good niche for the start, they do not have to give anything away, Coinbase and Bitpay already offer partial payments in Bitcoin/US$.

Not really. Bitcoin has a huge utility and advantages in relation to traditional methods, but it has not intrinsic value Buffett would invest in.

You can attempt to doublespend to an adress in your control.
You will not be able to outpace a payment processor like Bitpay or Coinbase through a race attack with your mobile, though. If you sell goods where you are not able to wait a few minutes for a confirmation and are not able to implement measures to guarantee a high confidence after seconds, you can just use a payment processors until there may be a better solution (I don't think there will or needs to be).
If Bitcoin is over because there are theoretical possibilities of fraud, there are no means of payment at all that you could use.

It is defined as a commodity in many places and there are incentives to hold to a certain degree (tax exemptions). It is treated similar to physical gold here. But I would agree that its main use is a currency.

Coinbase may also directly sell the Bitcoin earned through merchants to their clients (1.5 million wallets). That way they make 1% from merchants and 1% from clients (plus spread) without creating any buying or selling pressure.
But on the other hand, Coinbase is not the whole Bitcoin economy by far and there are stable phases in the exchange rate from time to time.

Yes, absolutely. If someone hacks your mail, he can retrieve passwords for every site your used it on (e.g. Amazon). On most of these sites, people save their credit cards and bank accounts as payment option. People can do **A LOT** more bad things with a credit cards number and a bank account number up to a degree where I would say that these kind of accounts/cards are not fit for the age of the internet. The only things safe to use are push-based payment systems like Bitcoin.

Talking about the stages of adoption often assumes a success to a certain degree. I don't think this is a high number considering Bitcoin's potential for international store and transfer value and as a payment system.

And as I am not the only one with this opinion, you may hear pretty often that everyone entering the market now is an early adopter (or innovator, for example in the field of remittances)

Because it is not a flaw of Bitcoin. What you are describing are environmental boundaries for its scalability. If Bitcoin grows faster than internet speeds and disk space allow to, growth will slow down. A fatal flaw will be something that may stop Bitcoin to work at all, not limit its growth. I don't think you really understand the words you are choosing. Maybe you will understand the difference if you think about it more deeply.
But after all, I would not expect the ordinary customer to run a full node on his PC (which is not the case today, on a much smaller blockchain!) with only one HDD build in and on an average internet connection (e.g. 150 mbit/s goes for 25€/month here and in most of europe and will scale up hugely over the next years). I think most people that use the internet are aware of limitations in disk space and internet speeds. I don't see why Bitcoin devs should educate anyone on environmental factors, if they have better things to do.

AFAIK, trailing stops are set at high points after the initial trade. For example, if you buy now and Bitcoin goes to $650 and down from there, a trailing stop would sell after it fell a specific percentage from that point. So in your example, the trailing stop stays at 1000 until your Bitcoins are sold or it goes higher with the next upswing.

Insurances and reimbursements can neither be protections from theft nor longterm solutions to that problem. Any measure that relies solely on someone paying back the losses is doomed to fail.
Bitcoin implements a range of technological solutions to that problem (ranging from push-based payments to multi-sig, encryption to a lot of other things).
Insurances and reimbursements are not dependent on the monetary system, though. Any company that works with Bitcoin can implement the same measures here. The only difference until now is governmental coverage, which is mainly based on fractional reserve and incompetence of the banking system (which should not exist in the Bitcoin ecosystem).


I am not an expert, but Bitcoin seems to solve the trust problem here. You do not have to trust anyone as long as there is no 51% attack (which is highly unlikely and not desirable for any entity). Don't forget that a pool consists of many different entity. There is not one building named GHash.Io but a lot of different miners doing what GHash proposes to do, until they decide not to. Even in worst case, nobody can take away your Bitcoin, they can only stop your transactions.


Basically yes. Volatility (especially downwards) may hold back some businesses to hold Bitcoin. This is one of the main reasons why mainstream merchant adoption is one of the last steps for mainstream Bitcoin adoption in my opinion.
@_date: 2014-03-31 12:14:28
For me, it sounds very logical to build a machine that does only one thing and not repurpose CPUs and GPUs. The barriers of entry are surely higher, but it also forces miners to a higher commitment to network security. If you invested a lot of money into mining equipment, you won't shut it of so fast or do something bad for the network (51% attack), while at places where only GPUs are used, you could decide to just sell everything and repurpose the GPU for Gaming.

Nobody can empty your account with only your public key. There are possibilities to conduct debits from cards or bank accounts. In most countries in the western world you may get most of it back if you close the account or cancel the card immediately, though. Sometimes they could say it is your fault to give away bank or credit card information, that is what I tried to say.

Yeah, it seems to show total transactions (incl. change), but both do not show how they obtain and calculate the data. Blockchain seems to be a lot glitchier with values jumping up and down.

Calculating value based on cashflow for something that does not generate cashflow does not work, for example.
Edit: he states the value of gold is based on its survivability (e.g. usable when the Internet shuts down). Assuming there would be nearly 0.5% of gold traded physically available, it makes a shitty currency at best.

I have read your post. It is full of loaded comments and misinformation.
Everyone involved in Bitcoin benefits from rising prices. There is neither less volatility nor is it more manageable at where it is now or less. It will be when market capitalization and liquidity is high enough.
What possibilites should I consider besides those I mentioned? Sure, there will be much more products on the blockchain but that would not drive the price down. To make the most money, investors and VCs have to make the price rise. And many of them already bought a lot of Bitcoin.

The Bitcoin network is currently running on 1166020.17 PetaFlops according to [BitcoinCharts](

Therefore there is almost no possibility to influence the network with your machines if they are not specifically build for Bitcoin mining.

Confirmation is not transaction. Confirmation for your card takes a month at least. ;)

Yes, it is still at a quite young stage.
The demand will grow naturally as it is superior to traditional payment systems/currencies/stores of value.
There is only a need for one of these, though. The best one will survive and will be able to supply the whole market.
The only thing altcoins are doing now, is lowering the barriers of entry for miners (thats why the most profitable litecoin clones are hyped until the block reward gets smaller) which are selling most coins for Bitcoin.

Bitcoin withdraws are stopped at gox, so normal people are not able to transfer them out. Nobody can stop the people that work at gox from that. So as long as people are selling there, gox employees can buy cheap and sell high on other exchanges.

The genie (distributed public ledger with an open source protocol) is out of the bottle. The only way for Bitcoin to fail (or become obsolete) is a successor that makes everything better and solves potential problems. As most of these thing mentioned above are either external or solvable through code that can be implemented on the blockchain or through improvements of Bitcoin, failure is highly unlikely.
The question would be: Who would be in charge of a successor or a competing protocol? International payments did not see innovation for decades.

No. Stability and security depends on the number of people confirming transactions and their contribution of hashes per seconds. If Facebook is the only entity doing transaction confirmations, Bitcoin is more secure and stable even if Facebook has more than a billion users/assets.

You think there will be a system announced in the next hours that revolutionizes the world without barriers of entry at the beginning? No matter how brilliant the concept is, the infrastructure will not jump into existence at once.
Bitcoin does not have a need for centralized exchanges. It is able to work with decentralized exchanges, but the exchange situation is surely better then with alternatives, so a big plus for Bitcoin.

@_date: 2014-01-17 12:32:44
That was a very interesting experiment, showing that there is not enough infrastructure there yet for international money transfers in Bitcoin. The fee he had to pay was extremely high (I though I was paying much with 0.5%)!
However, looking at the potential, for Bitcoin to be fit for transfers we need exchanges that compete worldwide for a low fee while traditional systems have to negotiate with every country and every bank on its way.
It is like having to pay for a postcard hoping it will find its target or waiting for your email service to become cheaper or free (and more people using it of course).

I basically think the same way. If you look at the general evolution and trust in the network (e.g. hashrate in the last weeks) and general awareness and adoption spreading, the negative sentiment surrounding Gox was keeping the price down and many people away from investing and using Bitcoin. As the sentiment slowly is getting much more positive, the way is paved for more serious projects. I also added to my position in the last days.

It is not really a problem yet, but when it becomes one, the hard fork is not a problem at all. Everyone that is involved would agree that it is good for the network to raise the limit when absolutely necessary. Install the new client and we go on with more transactions per second.

Yes, but there are possibilities, especially for institutions with enough reserves, to counter that risk. NeoBee for Example plans to offer a euro-pegged Bitcoin deposit. Clients can use Bitcoin whenever and wherever they like (saving the merchant money) and not lose a single € to volatility (but also not benefit from growth). Goldman Sachs (or Circle) may try to offer the same and therefore abolish that "*huge volatility risk*".

What stops you from charging back manually if you fuck up?
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:19:43
If you assume an insanely high velocity, yes. This implies someone holding a specific amount to serve as a liquidity reserve to make instant transactions possible without anyone holding any Bitcoin. As this reserve will not be anywhere near 100,000 BTC and the market for such kinds of transactions are in the trillions, you can see why many people are expecting Bitcoin to rise in exchange value.
This is also why many are seeing it as a good store of value. There are a lot of use cases adding to the potential market capitalization and to the exchange price of a unit. Doing transactions is not the only purpose.
@_date: 2014-05-30 18:22:58


Why would anyone try to do a double spend for a coke? It would be cheaper to just pay for that product. If you sell higher priced product and you probably won't see the client again or do not have any ID or other documents from him, you can always ask him to stay a few minutes.
Networks/altcoins with lower confirmation times are usually easier to attack (especially 51% attacks) and need more confirmations for the same security.

Where do you get that? Many people love to hoard money. Forcing an inflation of prices and devaluing currency does not show to be very effective in the long term. 
Bitcoin shows that many merchants, users, banks, developers, governments etc. are starting to accept, embrace and build services on top of it. Network and transactions are growing constantly.
By raising the limit you would have to buy and spend constantly because it may lose its value pretty fast (like Dogecoin) and you do not seem to like that.

The worst case would be a hardfork and maybe a change in encryption protocol, if a flaw somehow is found out of nowhere.
I don't think most early adopters are just trying to cash-out as soon as possible, though. IIRC, Silbert already said it is hard to get Bitcoin from early adopters as they are holding onto it.
Most of them are interested in building the Bitcoin economy and improve the financial world and everything where Bitcoin and the blockchain can be used.

Yes, I used Coinwarz for that. What about the miner from Cointerra? Seems to work pretty well for that. Don't forget to adjust the difficulty jumps in your link (30% is extremely unrealistic in the long run).
129 days to break even would be an awesome investment, though.
Also, I do not think that bigger miners are paying anything near the retail price shown on the web shops of the miner producers.
The confidence seems to be pretty strong and mining machines will become cheaper and be sold for less, especially if the price does not rise (which it probably will).

I personally think Bitcoin is ahead of its time, rather than the other way around. When a significantly better alternative comes around Bitcoin will surely be obsolete. The problems and drawbacks critics are bringing up, are mostly not Bitcoin inherent and can be solved through additional services, sane governments or additions to the blockchain/protocol. Bitcoin is taking all these hurdles right now and proves that it is way better than traditional systems in most use cases. So instead of waiting all your life for a new technology to come around, start to support our first big step into the future!
@_date: 2014-01-31 13:33:19

I don't think your proposed solution would cause less scamming. In the case of moolah, he posted his name, pictures of himself and made videos talking about himself. Nobody is able to detect if all of this is true. Registering a business with your name and address is obligatory in most countries anyway. By looking at the business model, you can detect scams more easily.
And yes, everyone who wants to invest money has to acquire the ability to check that for himself. Bitcoin does not take away this requirement. If you are not able to evaluate a business, stay away from it. It really is that easy. I didn't see a lot of cases where experienced business specialists have been scammed. Neo &amp; Bee was close to that, but their business model was not good enough to be considered a worthy investment.

Sure, but besides savings in transaction fee, rent for POS systems and other credit card related fees they would have to consider costs for implementation of Bitcoin solutions (e.g. Overstock had a project group locked up for two weeks), complaints and support and other operational costs.

JPM tried to clone Bitcoin and create an own cryptocurrency/digital currency and failed. That was what I "assumed".
Are you talking about Mintcoin in Canada? I know for a fact that the system in Europe is inferior as I use that together with Bitcoin on a daily basis.
Western Union and banks do have a big problem here. They are **not able** to reduce their fees (because of high cost basis). The next logical step following too big to fail is **too fat to compete** (lobbying regulators is really the only way for banks, assuming the regulators are not fed up yet).

Video applications exist since they have been developed.

Why without bank account? But in this case, Localbitcoins.
No VC invests $30 Million in a business he expects to fail. It is surely a high risk, but I doubt he didn't see the exact numbers of sales and projects in the pipeline. A VC always expects a high payout on a success rate as high as possible. With a huge amount of projects and money pumped into this economy this year in comparison to the same time last year, I don't really see how the market is saturated or stagnating, but everyone is entitled to his own opinion.

This is pretty much common knowledge here, but you are missing a few points. After the first rush to buy things with Bitcoin, everyone is free to fill up their accounts with more Bitcoin (maybe even cheaper after a little sell-off) and having a Bitcoin payment option and its logo on the page of a merchant may lead people to inform themselves about it and get into and maybe buy a few.
Most merchants are not interested in new technology apart from their own core business and only look for ways to get money fast and easy. As soon as those report less costs, more consumers and less problems, more merchants will jump on the train making it more efficient for everyone.

Yes, I only mentioned that to say that we can not be sure that the bearwhale is (an example of) an early adopter.
Cashing out means getting most out of that what you have. If you want to sell 30-50k BTC (like the Bearwhale did in very short time), there are not many early adopters holding that much and this is not a relatively small amount, you look to maximize the amount of fiat you can get for it. The only logical reason to sell such an amount with a direct market order is to manipulate the market downwards, not to cash out.

Exactly. Euro is a currency, the others are not! The legal tender always describes a currency, not the type of payment.
According to this [link]( (in german) everyone inside the eurozone has to accept the euro if the consumer wants to pay in euro. He is of course free to use credit/debit cards, SEPA transfers, Paypal or Bitcoin if the merchants (or operator of the website) accepts that.
You are right that only notes and coins are legal tender and as it is impossible to give a website notes and coins, you would have to use other means of payments. I can not find any source of regulations concerning legal tender for websites, though.

So they need at least an exchange that agrees to their $5 price fixing and/or a payment processor cashing that out for dollars.


You were talking about giving out a billion in gift cards and allowing to buy things for mined currency with a guaranteed price. I don't think there would be anybody able to hold a stake in that company not seeing how terrible that idea is.


With your own money. Just like you give someone $2 to buy a $2 Hotdog from you. There may be opportunities to sell more, but there are a lot of measures that do not cost many millions/billions.


Assuming someone other than yourself accepts that currency


Only people in the Cryptocurrency community would be interested in this and many would prefer Bitcoin.


Most of them are dumped as soon there is a bigger exchange available, killing price and volume.


Illegal almost anywhere


Needs to be external, so you can get legal tender for your amacoin (you can not pay taxes with Amacoin)


They would surely prefer a cryptocurrency without unnecessary middlemen.
A cryptocurrency lives from being decentralized and available to everybody and anybody, leaving out all the middlemen. You should know by now that your idea may have been interesting at the beginning, but Amazon or others are far from being able to successfully issue an own cryptocurrency.

The price finding process is not the main utility of Bitcoin, volume will come and go whenever necessary. For bigger volume, there are a lot of ways without publishing information.

Definitely not. It is easier to install a wallet of another altcoin than to find a reputable payment processor (like Bitpay or Coinbase) for an altcoin. Merchants increase the network effect no matter if they accept Bitcoin directly or through a payment processor. The number of merchants accepting Bitcoin is a lagging indicator for the growing userbase. No merchant would decide to just switch to another altcoin which does not have a comparable userbase. They want to sell their products with as few barriers as possible and not to speculate on possible successors.


You may be looking at the wrong abstraction level. Many points Bitcoin is lacking according to critics (or fiat does better) are services put on top of the monetary system, such as recurring payments or chargebacks. There is literally nothing stopping payment processors and other services to implement that.

You may need to source the opposite as I have never encountered any kind of limitation, especially not in the low terabytes, which is not really a lot of data these days.


Besides the reason why anybody runs a node now, why would you download (or buy) data everytime you need it if you can just keep the blockchain and every transaction that is made in Bitcoin on your own machines and run as many analyses as you like, anytime?




You learn every day. Having everyone run a full node is not decentralization, either. As long as there are thousand of nodes and data is freely available to anyone, there is no problem with decentralization.
I am not part of the development process, but I am looking forward to possible solution once they are necessary (they will not be implemented before they are necessary).

Merchants are free to choose between payment services like Coinbase/Bitpay or accepting Bitcoin and holding them. Many bigger companies may have rules and guidances that do not allow them to hold much of a "risk asset", but I know some smaller business owner myself that accept and hold Bitcoin and are very happy with that.
I think Coinbase and Bitpay are a nice ramp onto Bitcoin technology for people, that do not want or can not take the risk (and possible benefit) concerning the volatility of Bitcoin.

I guess it always depends on the question of why you should choose one over another. Nobody wants to have 100 different wallets because every store deals in a different Cryptocurrency. Therefore there will always be a leader with far over 50% marketshare, a second one with ~25% or less etc.

Of course you could add network and transaction safety to that point and possibility to exchange in and out of Bitcoin to that list, together with adoption. The rational answer is to switch to Bitcoin as most cryptocurrency are copies with a few randomly changed characteristics but with much higher risks.

It is not only that other coins are not large enough, the ASICS they use and paid for (and which probably still are not amortized) can not be used for other things than mining Bitcoin. GHash needs Bitcoin to be successful and is fully dependend on the Bitcoin economy, not the other way around.

It didn't really react the last times. Ghash also never approached 50% of the hash rate, but 50% of block rewards over a timeframe of 24 hours, which is a huge difference. Ghash's share of hashing power never significantly exceeded 40%.

I think the problem here is the volatility and especially crashes due to problems in the infrastructure (like we see after each bubble) rather than the inflation of the monetary basis. If Bitcoin would be on a steady/stable rise proportional to the rate of growth of network/userbase and mining of new coins, there would be a lot more confidence in spending (as nobody wants to buy goods with Bitcoins perceived undervalued).
@_date: 2014-10-02 17:40:04

Ok, I only see a decentralized solution as possible for a worldwide use in all areas, as there have been centralized currencies like Liberty Reserve or others that have been shutdown. I guess Bitcoin would not exist at this moment if it had a issuing company if you look at ridiculous head lines like "Bitcoin CEO arrested for Money laundry!", but I guess we just have different opinions here.
I see speculators as a partially good force as they bring liquidity, new capital and movement into markets, which causes media awareness (not only the good one, of course) and wider adaption.
In its simplest definition it also can be used as a store of value, many surely try to do but the medium of exchange surely is the biggest benefit of the protocol.

Everyone is greedy and only thinks about himself, that is exactly why only free markets can be succesful in the long run (intervention is done by greedy/corrupt people).

Yes, that's a classical fallacy here. While your average ROI per BTC may decrease, your net worth still increases more than if you would not rebuy (assuming that the exchange rate is rising further).
I can't really imagine why someone who is involved in Bitcoin for more than a year would not rebuy either directly after or when the price is lower than at time of purchase (Buy goods with Bitcoin you only paid a fraction of the good's price for and rebuy for potentially half the worth of the good afterwards).

Yes, the liquidity in USD/EUR equivalent increases massively, not necessarily in Bitcoin. You should also consider this: If Bitcoin is established in the mainstream and accepted everywhere, why should you sell it for other types of money or currency if all the other alternatives can be watered down and devalued by the government, but you will always have a fixed share in the Bitcoin network (for example 10 BTC out of 21 million BTC)?

But selling Bitcoin because of this is like selling your Tesla Stock because the Frankfurter Börse chooses to close. And I never said this will have no effect, I would expect a short term overreaction.

Your calculation is based on the assumption that all of the Bitcoin available can and will be used only for remittance and commerce/retail payments, while most of them are used as a store of value.
IIRC someone stated that there are half a million of Bitcoin available at any time as a liquid reserve on exchanges, ready to be used for payments. If you divide your calculated market cap by that, you will get to a very different number.
But after all, nobody can say exactly which use-cases will be adopted in which way with Bitcoin.

I don't think they are very negative, but solely slightly ignorant or misinformed which is only a matter of time. Bitcoin is pretty complicated on first sight, after all.
I think the high fees are referring to the fees and costs attached to exchanges and ways to buy/sell Bitcoin. There is a lot of potential for improvement here.
Also funny to note how OP mentions QR codes that will never take off and everyone says where they are useful, but not a single notion of Bitcoin.

No, there are many ways to double spend. Take a look at the [wiki]( Everybody can try to conduct a race attack, for example. If the dice site pays out wins without confirmation on a transaction that is poorly propagated, you can reverse that transaction with a high fee. This is allegedly also what the address close to GHash did. You do not need any hashrate or mining equipment to do this, it is completely unrelated to the mining process. With over 50%, GHash could reverse transactions that were confirmed by them.

Banks do not benefit from payments or from storage of money. They mostly only do this with acceptable fees because they are forced to.
The profit lies in lending and financial instruments. As the FED said, Bitcoin may be a boon for banks as it allows to outsource those inprofitable processes onto a decentralized network.

He owns 1/21th of the whole thing, but does not get paid by those entering the market or using Bitcoin. Being able to sell parts of your cake for more in the future is an indication of a growing market (nothing we haven't seen in any other market). It works perfectly without increasing in value and making anyone rich, though (something we see rarely). That point can not be stressed enough. Bitcoin is more than a price chart.

There was no government support until the latest rulings. Do you expect all governments to work together just to shut Bitcoin down and raid all places that contain nodes? Most of them are really crazy but governments shutting something down in the name of consumer protection? Most of countries where Bitcoin is popular (e.g. USA and China) are seriously lacking in consumer protection.

Many people still think it is not fit as a store of value based on the argument that it is not stable enough or too volatile, which is not a real criteria in economics.

Some people even pay money for that, can you imagine? That service would surely be nice in Bitcoin. I do not trust the lending services at the moment, though.
I do not know in what world you live, but I do not see any positive about current economical politics regarding inflation. Merchants are seeing enough sales and they are growing steadily, which has proven the concept of Bitcoin.
With build-in inflation and devaluation (due to inflation being higher than economical growth), there is also less incentive for a merchant to accept a cryptocurrency. Just holding and not buying anything is not the best thing in the long run, but you can be sure to hold a certain percentage of the network (given the inflation of Bitcoin slows down, eventually) and spending Bitcoin is faster, cheaper, easier and safer than any other payment method.
@_date: 2014-07-26 15:13:25


Yes, it takes no effort and saves them a lot of money. AFAIR there was a big start in sales, followed by a decrease and picked up somewhere in may where sales numbers rose back again.

To become widely adopted into the mainstream, Bitcoin needs to be distributed more than it is now, speaking of people buying in and using it. If we create a oligarchy comparable to the situation in fiat currencies depends on who sells their Bitcoin to these new people. I would doubt that Satoshi starts to sell his stash, though.
Edit: keep in mind that many of the big wallets are pools or exchange wallets. If everyone decided to withdraw into his own wallet, distribution may look a little more balanced.

These points are speaking for Bitcoin, as these are either developed or initiated right now or in the near future. Work is in progress. You would have to start from scratch for a new cryptocurrency.


The whole point about Bitcoin and Cryptocurrencies is that it is decentralized and not issued by a central organization. Many organization already have their own currency/payment system. Bitcoin is easier, faster and cheaper.




I don't know exactly about these arguments, but most new cryptos strive to be less open in their transaction history. Most people shy away from an open ledger, especially criminals which do not like Bitcoin for that. I am pretty sure that could be build on the blockchain, though.
The successor of Bitcoin should have **significant** advantages and not just some minor feature improvements (if those are improvements at all).

Ok, it seems the article translates it wrong. What I am seeing is:

I am currently paying a fee of 0.15% for usage of my credit card, which is one of the lowest here in Germany. The merchant fee comes on top of that.
AFAIR 3% is the VISA standard fee for merchants, but bigger merchants may negotiate a much lower fee. High credit card fees also may be the reason why I practically can't buy groceries or other products with a tight margin with a credit card anywhere.

Exactly, confirmations in networks with a very high hash rate are usually to block out attacks by miners (especially 51% attacks). In Bitcoin, miners need a monopoly for 10 minutes to hours to successfully execute an attack, while it is less on other networks. Double spending is extremely hard even if there is no confirmation yet, if the transaction is propagated well.
With higher hash rate shorter confirmation times are dangerous and counter-productive (and lead to more orphaned blocks/wasted energy).
@_date: 2014-07-03 17:16:05

The investment does not get you any money. You have to go out, look for a buyer and negotiate a price (this is pretty fast and easy on an exchange).

Bitcoin may offer savings in fees which have to incorporated into the price. Either the business keeps the savings or sells products for slightly less. If there is competition in the market, they have no choice but to lower the prices in the long term.

Didn't hurt Bitcoin, but would anyone who issues own coins without the guaranteed possibility to cash out.


So you are giving away at least a billion dollars and possibly much more (through effortless external mining) just in hope it catches on? What benefit are you expecting from that? You could save that billion and much more by just accepting Bitcoin.
Even if they lost billions in 18 years, **NOBODY** jeopardizes that much money. Shareholders would slaughter them for that idea. They need results and they need them fast.


Exactly. It takes no effort to accept a cryptocurrency or use a payment provide to get your local legal tender for a very low fee, but it takes a huge effort to develop, establish and maintain an own currency for a bigger userbase.
I haven't seen a single advantage of having an own crypto, yet.

This is sadly what many people still believe, but you need huge investments in infrastructure and a solid development (most altcoins copy huge parts of the code from Bitcoin, if you want to create a Bitcoin killer you obviously need to be significantly better) to guarantee a secure network, a growing userbase and merchants accepting it. Besides Bitcoin, there is only Litecoin which can barely be seen as an established Cryptocurrency.
I think assuming even 1% of Amazon's total user base would use that currency is extremely optimistic. I would expect a userbase comparable to Bitcoin if you airdropped a new currency worldwide, available to every user instantly.
Also, guaranteeing a price ($5) for an unit of (crypto-)currency is extremely risky for any participant. You would have to guarantee that the price of production is below that to not make losses with every purchase. If you give that away and let people mine that cryptocurrency and nobody besides you accepts it in their store (Amazon is not really popular with other merchants, to put it nicely), you are practically giving away your money with possibility of capitalizing on it. Imagine Amazon sits on millions of their own coins and the only thing they can buy with it, are their own goods. And there are thousands of people buying their goods with tokens that are worthless everywhere else.
This is only my opinion and my understanding, but this scenario is mainly why I believe there is no possibility for a cryptocurrency issued and governed by a central entity.

That's the business model of Peter Schiff and his Gold debit card.
Accepting and managing money, assets and property is not the core business of most companies that accept Bitcoin. Same goes for USD, there is a payment processor in most cases (e.g. VISA). Therefore the better choice for most companies is to accept Bitcoin through a payment processor until employees and suppliers can be paid with it. Overstock is currently working on that, so we may see some change soon.
Spreading awareness works equally well in both cases (Accepting Bitcoin looks the same as Accepting "Bitcoin"), benefits are pretty obvious for merchants (less fees and risks) so it does not really matter.

How long do your Bitcoin transactions take normally? Mine are finished before I can press OK, but I am not the fastest guy.

@_date: 2014-03-12 08:31:56
I think it really depends on the trading volume, which might be very high on a NY based exchange. With a high trading volume, they could probably operate with a very low fee compared to other exchanges.

That's a really good question as this kind of spendable money with rising purchasing power is very new to humanity.
There are signs signalling that sales are rising together with price: 
The amount of data we have here is not enough for a conclusion, in my opinion, may be just a coincidence. Many politicians and economical experts think they need money to lose value to motivate people to buy stuff.
On the other hand you may be more open to spend money that you paid less for as a positive emotional signal of rising purchasing power. But people will definitely think twice before they buy something, which is not bad in my opinion. A lot of products need to improve in quality.
@_date: 2015-01-04 18:48:41
No, I am not switching topics. This is exactly what I am talking about. Hoarding shares and profiting from holding through interest is good for companies that have productive business models and are building an economy. If there is no economy backing that system, there is also no motivation to either hold or trade PoS coins (see: low volume and high concentration of wealth throughout PoS coins). Therefore it wouldn't make sense at all to consider to implement that mechanic.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:31:42
Yes, some of the exchanges work without fees but even if you only take those that charge fees, the selling pressure coming from miners is still extremely low (assuming they use the exchanges to sell all of their Bitcoins immediately).

@_date: 2015-01-04 13:10:12
Thanks for the analysis.. 1470 BTC is about 2.5% of the global volume on a very slow day.
@_date: 2015-01-04 13:15:55
This is pretty obvious if you compare the amount of Bitcoin mined with global volume on a daily basis. Only a small fraction of selling pressure can be explained by miners dumping (assuming they throw all they get on the market immediately).

Bitcoin does not have to be the legal tender and reserve currency in every country to be successful. It was primarly designed to be a tool for transfer of value on a decentralized and public ledger. It can be used as a store of value, means of transfer of value and as a payment system (although there will always be the hassle of currency swaps in that scenario).
Many Liberals/Libertarian may disagree that the state's ability to print as much money as they want to achieve their goals is a sustainable model in the long term.
However, Cryptocurrencies do not necessarily circumvent the state's ability to confiscate and redistribute wealth. There is always a possibility to tax your sales and your income, as both have to be reported no matter in what currency they are transacted to support welfare, infrastructure and so on.
Bitcoin may threaten the economical status quo in many cases, assuming there will be a point where it will be adopted so far that this discussion becomes relevant, but as the status quo is neither cemented nor perfect, this is an interesting experiment to see how economies may work with Cryptocurrencies.

@_date: 2015-01-04 15:50:40
To which part exactly? According to Bitcoinwisdom, the exchange volume for the last 24 hours (for the top 5 currencies) is above 700,000 BTC. 3600 BTC (the daily amount of mined Bitcoins) is about 0.5% of that. Of course a big part of the volume is coins being pushed back and forth due to 0 fees at some exchanges, but you get the idea.
@_date: 2014-02-28 07:53:06
@_date: 2014-07-23 13:19:49
Exactly, that is why I am asking. Does the POS system only support their own debit cards or also others? Does it support credit card? How do the additional fees look like for that?
@_date: 2015-01-04 15:07:41
No, it is about 1% or lower on average and 2.5% in worst case on a daily basis.
How could PoS solve this "problem"? PoS cryptocurrencies are also generating coins (through other means, but this does not change anything).

Bitcoin combines money inflation (total supply of coins is growing) with price deflation (economy is growing faster than the inflating money supply). Because of this, each unit of the currency must be able to purchase more goods and services over time.
The fact that the economy around Bitcoin hat such a steep growth and is still expanding rapidly and supply of Bitcoins is declining over time (less bitcoins per unit of time), forces the price itself to grow exponentially.

One of the main concerns here is that we really need more (and more reliable) exchanges everywhere, P2P preffered.
Also, do not keep your Bitcoin an any wallet, that you do not control yourself.
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:44:49
They only blocked deposits. Everyone can still convert to RMB and cash out or withdraw BTC. Many of BTCChina's clients were not from china (no fees until now) and would just transfer their BTC to other exchanges. So in the long run, the traffic of China's exchanges will be substituted by others

This is mainly because there isn't anything comparable to the decentralized network. For traditional currencies, there is a third party for everything you want to do that execute all the necessary steps. Most of these things could be done with Bitcoin without anyone (of the regular joes) noticing and this will probably be the case if it succeeds and according to some voices the third parties don't even know exactly how all of these things work. I think Bitcoin does hugely reduce complexity in distribution of value, it just does not go the traditional way.

It has the use users are giving it, just like every other thing. It is able to serve as store of value, as a payment system and as a money transfer system (where it outperforms any competitor, only constricted by complexity). Cash is always more convenient, either for normal purchases or illicit activities, but it does not gain value. Other payment methods may be more convenient, but are far more expensive. On the other hand, that is the safest market on the planet, as long as it is illegal, just a little too dangerous to pay with Bitcoin there or use Bitcoin on your own for laundering or tax evasion.

I was surprised that they were almost positive in the beginning and let people trade freely.
I guess they concluded to ban transfer of yuan to exchanges after understanding what Bitcoin is and does, to stop people from getting yuan out of the economy or the country and stop money laundering/tax evasion.

Of course you have to take the risk, there is no excemption in any market. You lose wealth in Gold and you lose it in any Fiat currency.
Again, your article references all the revenues, that were collected since the start of SR, which were huge. My article states todays situation. Dating of article is not relevant as both are actual enough.
Why would you say, that its use as storage of value, money transfer and payment system is only useful for people who buy/sell drugs? It is used for legal payments, activities and so on, so this is possible and people have already reported to pay less/lose less money than with other payment systems. Gold lost much of its value and almost reaches into critical prices ranges, some ETFs already collapsed and people lost a lot of money there. So the question is: Why can Bitcoin NOT be used for legal transactions, payments and store of value?

Hoarding also got less this year. This whole investing and speculation is not as big a problem as many think. On the other hand this is exactly how a store of value works.

Price Deflation is deflation of the good kind, as the prices decline, while your currency gains in value compared to the goods.
The deflation that caused big depressions is where money supply is collapsing faster then the economy, which is unlikely in Bitcoin's scenario where the economy has a faster grow rate than creation of coins through mining. That is how I understand it, not an expert though.
@_date: 2013-12-16 15:33:18
1) Merchants, that want to pay less of their profits to transaction fees
2) People that want to pay less fees (credit card, square etc) or transact money to friends and family worldwide, invest in a deflationary currency, commodity.
(nobody forced to use drugs in this scenario)
Your article states the total revenues from the beginning. It was used for drugs in the beginning, which does not render all the other purposes impossible.
My article states todays situation, where drug sales are only a small part of btc transactions, as it is not as anonymous as cash according to the US senate. That is the reason why the big players do not sell their drugs for bitcoin.

There is no floor, so it can go down by 100% in worst case. It has the possibility to start a economical revolution and gain hugely in value.
There is a floor on gold, it looks nice and is good for electronical surfaces, contacts etc. So the floor is somewhere between copper and silver. The bubble caused by this huge bull run has popped though and there is no big chance for a price increase or stabilization.
There is a floor on the US-Dollar. The government will protect it as legal tender, no matter what happens. Hyperinflation and other economical disasters can eat away that value by 99.99% and more.
The question would be rather: participate in an economical revolution and possibly benefit hugely from it or stick to traditional values to ensure at least 1% of your wealth in the long term?
