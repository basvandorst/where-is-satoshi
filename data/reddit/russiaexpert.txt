MEMS main advantage is low cost for the degree of precision they provide, but I think there were accelerometers precise to a thousandth of m/s² by that time. Not going to argue about the class of control loop that requires landing the boosters, tho I have a gut feeling it's no different than the normal case of controlled rocket propulsion with shifting centre of mass, or reactive landing of Lunar Excursion Module.
LEM actually highlights how little computing power there's needed. It was 1960s embedded computing tech; by the end of 1970s you'd have an advantage of a decade of Moore's law. Also, you can achieve quite a lot with a speicalized computing device even with otherwise primitive component base.
Also, consider that noone did booster landing say in 2000, when tech was not very different from today and most definitely up to the task. That suggests the real reason is institutional rather than technological. That is, noone could be arsed or dare enough to risk their careers over this.

You could but depending on the market timing it could be anywhere in strength from tequila to tap water.

It takes careful design, good math and intimate knowledge of PID control, but not *that* much computational power per se. People had supersonic guided missiles and landed interplanetary ships propulsively already in 1970s.
