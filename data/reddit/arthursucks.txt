I don't foresee anyone in that demographic using bitcoin in the near future.

I'm in Long Beach but would be willing to take the train up north.

Guns can't [solve all of our problems](

I'm not a gun owner myself but I think need them to make up for their small penises.

I actually did this a while ago. Bought $2 worth of coins and now they're worth $4!

I know a lot of people are complaining about how high the exchange is on this but this looks like the most mainstream attempt at bitcoin in the real world market that I've ever seen. There's two of them in my area now. Last year there was zero.

Without the source code for these projects we do not truly have a open web alternative. Are any of these projects open source?

Honestly I don't know if Bitcoin itself is the future so much as the technology that powers it.
The beautiful thing about an open source project like this is sometimes the fork is a game changer.
