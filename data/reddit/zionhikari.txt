I just tried it and it says the wallet is full. And i saw on github and they say you can't open two wallet in the same browser as they share local storage, try using one on normal browser and one on incognito

Are you talking about the bitcard on  ?
If so I don't think they hold your bitcoin, they just manufacture the physical object that you put your address on for convenience and the password only decrypt the encrypted BIP38 private key so you can spend the bitcoin afterward. Since BIP38 is a standard now it should be compatible with almost every wallet.

They still did not advertised it as an alternative, those two are totally different things.
@_date: 2014-10-30 07:34:49
But they're not marketing it as a cold storage, cold storage implies something that is completely offline, maybe you're confused with their original Vault where they keep their keys offline. Anyways, the new Vault is alternative to multisig wallet like GreenAddress or BitGo which are NOT Cold Storage.
You're right that serving the page over the web contains risks and they should make Chrome Apps or Firefox Plugins for it. But you got to remember that the new vault JUST came out. 
If you're REALLY paranoid you could always opt to use their Open source recovery tool which you can download off Github whenever you wanna transfer funds from the vault.

Making the nakamoto
@_date: 2014-10-30 02:00:10
I have some question. Would it be possible to lower or eliminate the delay time only for the multi-sig vault? Now that the vault requires 2 passwords I don't see why not. And if not, when the E-mail and SMS alert arrive, can we reply back "Accept this" to bypass the 48 hours delay.

Use the backup key with the tool provided to send it to another wallet.

There's a small Beta word smack dab on the logo

If you only provide them an already encrypted private key manually (with a strong password) they have no way to spend your funds without brute forcing it (which is why you should use a strong password, but BIP38 are very hard to brute force so it's up to you). What boggles me though is why would anyone order the unencrypted wallet card.

Did you try using multiple devices with the same livenet/testnet setting/same PeerJs settings(Do not change these.)? I don't have access to my main copay device right now. 
@_date: 2014-11-01 06:54:42
They recently updated the wallet, you can create a new account then re-import the wallet file.

This is the same for any Brick and Mortars, and if the seller is worried about it, he can opt to use BitPay and they assume all double spending risks.

While we're on this topic, I found more things related to copay:
1. My wallet is actually stored on my cookies under bitpay.com so if you set your browser to delete cookies you will delete the wallet (I'm using the Copay Firefox Extension), make sure to whitelist bitpay.com (your wallet) and addons.mozilla.org (this is where your last address index and amount are stored).
2. There doesn't seem to be any automated address discovery past 6 addresses, I have to manually click add if I restore from a backup that previously did not have the address. This becomes a problem with change addresses since we cannot manually add it.
@_date: 2014-10-01 06:38:16
I don't see what the problem is, this applies to any wallet that doesn't download the blockchain. They pull data relevant to the public address but doesn't reveal who owns the address. For example, Copay relies on their Insight server to query addresses but on the server end they probably see an IP and the address being downloaded, not knowing whether you own said address, or just looking at it.

Holy Satoshi I didn't even think of that, that's genius.

Branched or not Multisig is still =\= cold storage. They still didn't advertise the branched vault as cold storage.
@_date: 2014-07-19 08:44:01
it's just like the electrum servers, you and other people can operate your own server, peerJS is open source after all.
@_date: 2014-08-14 05:57:45
Any multisig could do what you described. For example:
A 6 of 18 multisig where one person holds 6 keys instead of a "master key" and two other person each hold 3 keys for "level 2" and three other people each hold 2 keys for "level 3" and so on.
@_date: 2014-07-15 08:20:09
What about a 7th Wallet for Multisig? Require 2 of 3 keys, server hold one key, you hold another one and a paper backup. If server gets hacked, they still can't access your account and you can unlock it with your backup, if you get hacked the server can refuse to sign your key if the hacker can't provide the 2FA. If they steal your backup they'd need to get access to your computer to spend it.
@_date: 2014-07-19 06:58:38
the web version do this, no idea why the android doesn't, but you can simply copy the email then paste the raw text as an .aes file
@_date: 2014-10-31 00:34:03
By that logic any type of address is orthogonal since they could be kept offline.
@_date: 2014-07-19 02:50:37
One word, FINALLY! Also anyone else notice if you make a one of one wallet, you still generate a multisig address?

oh my god the memories, I actually fell for the ISK doubling scam once, gotta learn the hard way :(
@_date: 2014-09-16 10:31:58
All these people suggestion to creating a raw transaction without broadcasting gotta remember: you need an internet connection to get the unspent outputs unless you happen to carry a blockchain or memorize the hash everywhere you go.

Hi, this is Jeff here, I would like to contact you regarding the acquisition of bitcoin.equipment domain for $10,000.

For those who are unaware, this articles plus the most of the people commented on here are paid shill by the same people at Frozenbit.io (Click on them, either one post account or all their posts are about dissing GreenAddress and promoting Frozenbit), the whole article itself is nitpicking on 2-of-2 multisig but failed to mention their nLockTime mechanic that you can use to unlock your funds if GreenAddress goes out if business, and completely forgot to mention another multisig company known as BitGo.
If you don't believe me, here are the shill posts:
