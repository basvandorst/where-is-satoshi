What proof are you asking for, kind sir?
The proof of Bitcoin thefts?

As I mentioned in my earlier comment the case is not yet filed with the court. We are preparing to do so. I cannot disclose much details at this moment.
The purpose of this post is not to prove anything but to reach out to people who had their Bitcoins stolen from Coinbase.

Agree, did not handle the Bitcoins properly by entrusting them to Coinbase.
Had 2FA and all account security enabled, still had Bitcoins stolen from Coinbase account. This happened to a number of people. You are lucky it did not happen to you.
As to Coinbase TOS it is up to the court to decide whether it is enforceable. That is why we have litigation.

I cannot post transaction IDs, even if I did it will merely show BTC going from one address to another which is not a proof of theft. Same goes for screenshots.
However we have proof of negligence on Coinbase part in keeping user accounts safe. I cannot post this here before the case goes to court.

Everything you say in your message is 100% right from the standpoint on someone who never suffered a theft from Coinbase account. 
You have a strong password, 2FA enabled, API disabled, all account security settings tight. Still one morning you wake up to find out all funds were transferred out of your account. You never received any 2FA codes on your cell. Your Coinbase account security settings are still the same. Your email account was not hijacked. You figure it must be a mistake and contact Coinbase. They apologize. That’s it. They stop communicating with you.
There are quite a few stories like this shared on Bitcoin forums. If it did not happen to you, it does not mean it did not happen to anyone else. Again, the purpose of this post is not to prove anything but to reach out to people who had their Bitcoins stolen from Coinbase.
Once this case is filed with the court, you will have all technical details. For now just be safe and don’t trust your Bitcoins to any online wallets.
