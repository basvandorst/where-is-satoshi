Nope, you definitely don't use it because 'its' is a personal pronoun. It has nothing to do with 'it is' confusion, it's because all personal pronouns already show possession so an apostrophe would be redundant.

His comment is craaaazy, he's saying that bitcoin enthusiasts are going to bring down the US (and worldwide ?) governments by using their superior intelligence.

When did the bitcoin community become this extreme, this is the first thread i've read in a while, and people are talking like they are going to go and buy the anarchists cookbook.

This is below a lot of downvoted posts so not sure if anyone will ever read it, but the reason for this is you don't use the possesive apostrohe for personal pronouns like its, thiers, ours &amp;C&amp;C.

I'm gonna be honest and say I don't know a  huge amount about this, but whose ever side of the story you take I don't understand it.  
This is a thread in Aug 2014 talking about if the new forum will allow uploading of avatars... 
Does this not seem ludicrous to anyone else, hasn't that kind of functionality been available on cheap or free forum software for about 10 years now?
