Ok so lets say you have 15k-20k USD burning a hole in your pocket with the end goal of having coins and contributing to the btc ecosystem. Do you buy and hodl or do you buy mining equipment/invest in infrastructure (btc atm or asic)? Give me your opinions.

Honestly for someone new to the sport (eBay or crypto) this ad looks like it contains a power supply. If I bought this and contacted you for the missing power supply and you said no I would push the issue with eBay cs. I think you are in the wrong and should send him a power supply or allow the return.

@_date: 2019-05-08 19:12:51
I personally like Square's Cash APP, but coinbase is fine as well. I would strongly recommend you get yourself a Ledger Nano S (or X if you feel comfortable with bluetooth) or a Trezor to store your coins long term.
Safety First!
@_date: 2019-05-15 16:04:02
He should use bitwage lol

Per wikipedia:
In 2002, Ver pleaded guilty to selling explosives without a license, to illegally storing explosives, and to mailing the explosives. Ver bought 49 pounds of "Pest Control Report 2000" explosives, sold at least 14 pounds of them as large firecrackers on eBay, stored the explosives in a residential apartment building, and mailed them to customers via the U.S. Postal Service. He was sentenced to 10 months in federal prison.
