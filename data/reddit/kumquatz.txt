I think you are wrong on many levels:
As long as it is good quality I don't care so much about the profit margin. I like wooden toys much more than plastics or electronics for little children. 
Also this was just a little addition to the selection my parent bought already used for me when I was a child. So those products live across generation. You cannot say that for a lot except for wooden products.
Also, the resell value is quite a high, in case there is no new generation whom to pass it to.

Thank might take a while. I'll get back to you when I am done.

Since my *ironic* title seems to be misleading. Here is the background.
This wooden chest actually belongs to me since more than 30 years and I had it buried in the garden of my parents home for many years with my childhood stones in it. When I visited my parents I found the chest and thought it would be fun to refurbish it and connect my childhood treasure with actual treasuries.
So I laser-engraved an unrelated BTC address and some logos/hashes. 
Obviously this is not a privat key and if it were it would not be my only backup of the wallet nor posted publicly. 
In the end it is just me being a little creative with modern technoligy put on the oldest material humans have used. It is more art than a real usecase but I might think of engraving a receiving address onto a smaller coin and actually keeping it with me in case I want to by some BTC offline without getting my smartphone next to unknown other technical devices.

True, I should get multiple of the chests and hide them at secure palces and then make geocaching mysteries for the kids when they turn 18. Then they have a puzzle to solve and when they manage it the can pay their college education with it :)

No, this is just the QR code of an empty address.

No the opposite. The goal is not to make as much FIAT as possible but to have a whole bitcoin. So it would help if there is a bust period again because you can buy more for less.

Actually I would expect the monthly growth rate to be more than 5% but anyway it sounds like a good idea!

That was actually the point in the visualization, how long it will take to buy a whole bitcoin. It is not an recommended investment plan. Also if you change the monthly interest parameter to 10% it will be very unlikely that you ever will be able to buy a whole coin with that plan.

For bitcore (btx) you do not need a private key, just a signed message from your bitcoin wallet. Currently one btx is worth about 6 dollars but there are additional airdrops.

That is true. However I am holding them and see if they gain value and hit more exchanges. The developers are promising. I think it is still the beginning of the project but the initial coins can only be claimed till November.
