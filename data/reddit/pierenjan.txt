I added a [replace script]( (bash). This will move your plots after generating. I don't know python, so I did it in bash.


This will generate image, move it to the given directory, store it as YYYYMMDDHHMMSS-mtgox.png and will make a symlink 'last.png' in the target directory. If the imagemaking fails, it will not overwrite the last image.

1) The testnet is an alternative Bitcoin block chain, to be used for testing. This allows application developers or bitcoin testers to experiment, without having to use real bitcoins or worrying about breaking the main bitcoin chain.
2) There is a function for encrypted wallet backupping. You can then send that file, indeed.
