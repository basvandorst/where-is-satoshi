Exchanges are fine to use, they are just not fine to keep Thousands of dollars in bitcoin in. If you are not buying or selling at the given moment you should transfer the coins to a wallet you and only you control.

Ding Ding Ding.

Because its a scam? Even if its the real hacker what incentive would he/she have to return your bitcoins to you for 1/4th their cost?
No sense spreading around false hope for those already hurting.

Still a better answer than the traditional online shopping method where each merchant would have your credit card numbers. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 05:05:18
Pretty much as secure as your device is. Your keys will only live on the phone.
@_date: 2016-08-03 14:21:39
Ah what the hell, why not try haha:

I don't personally use one so I wouldn't know sorry!

Because Paypal doesn't work without a funds or a funding source?

Eh, low risk, high reward. Nothing lost for posting an address so I figure many people thought why not?
@_date: 2016-08-08 21:29:57
Without an army or other nations that recognize that you are a country it doesn't really matter.
@_date: 2016-08-11 21:14:55
Get a real wallet, is you want another quick app experience I would suggest bread wallet if you are on iOS. You can certainly still use circle as an exchange but don't keep large amounts there.

Depends how much 1 million USD is worth in 20 years :p
@_date: 2016-08-10 21:11:06
To each their own I suppose.
@_date: 2016-08-04 01:15:33
So yeah...anyone want to pay me 10,000 BTC to buy them 2 Papa John's pizzas?
@_date: 2016-08-07 15:23:17
Exactly, so what would happen instead would be that your money would be held up in court hearings for say a couple years until after they lose, in which case a good amount of the money will be burnt up in legal fees leaving everyone will a much larger loss than 36%.

Unfortunately creating a country requires a lot more than land and money.

Hopefully this holds off the negativity here, if just for a little while ��
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:57:36
There is always a fee when transferring to wallets but usually it's under a quarter if I remember correctly. Given I've never moved huge amounts. Usually wallets just scale the fee dynamically so that miners will validate your transaction.
@_date: 2016-09-22 18:38:22
Use breadwallet myself, like it.

Probably a really dumb question but a quick search didn’t bring it up for me:
What does capacity mean for a lightning node?
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:10:24
Using software like bitcoin.tax made it pretty easy
@_date: 2018-07-24 17:09:48
More than 0, less than 21 million
@_date: 2018-07-24 15:07:47
Maybe not today but the last week looked more like alts flowing into BTC which was increasing the dominance.
@_date: 2018-07-27 19:53:55
Hey if you are set on it go for it, but I honestly think you will regret it. Year over year bitcoin has only gone up, you just have to zoom out a bit. Each year the lowest bitcoin has been for the year gets higher and higher and I don’t believe it’s stopping any time soon.
@_date: 2017-05-22 06:06:37
Was actually 2 pizzas...but yeah haha
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:50:04
Needs more rocket.
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:13:06
I don't think anyone is saying that 1 santoshi will ever hit an amount like that
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:14:53
Not really a pay cut if their coins increase in value like the last halving :)
@_date: 2016-07-07 15:29:35
If you want to just learn as a hobby? Sure. To make money? Absolutely not.
@_date: 2016-07-12 14:53:22
Why would anyone offer the full loss as a reward....?
@_date: 2016-07-09 04:21:13
Instructions unclear, just bought all the eggs at the store.
@_date: 2016-07-12 15:08:52
So aside from sweet sweet justice....why would OP waste time since he/she has nothing to gain from this person being caught?
@_date: 2016-07-09 05:02:27
I'm dying lol
@_date: 2016-07-07 05:05:50
Same haha

I currently prefer circle since the transactions are instant if you use a debit card. They price their exchange about $5 more per coin than coinbase but with the current price of bitcoin it comes out to be cheaper than coinbase's 1% charge.
@_date: 2016-07-07 04:33:27
Literally just bought at 675, bah lol
@_date: 2016-07-11 15:45:03
Same, unless im making some kind of mistake the higher exchange price of circle still beats the 1% coinbase is charging too. plus instant transfers from debit without a fee.
@_date: 2016-07-09 18:09:31
Lol
