That's purchasing power, and can be a result of deflation, although it can be a result of inflation as well. The definition of inflation is just what I said it was, expanding the supply of money. Purchasing power is effected, but it isn't the definition.

To add to this explanation, the reason that increased purchasing power can be a result of inflation, is because depending on where in the chain you're at, inflation may not have affected the market yet. For instance, the reason the government likes inflation is because they can purchase things at market price with newly inflated dollars. By the time the market stabilizes to account for the inflation, they've already purchased what they needed, and can reap the benefits in the form of taxation. In the meantime, prices go up due to an increased supply of dollars, and so they now just inflate the currency more to offset the cost to themselves... and so the cycle goes on. 
Obviously I've oversimplified this quite a bit, leaving much out, but that's the basic idea.

Here's a question that I'm sure someone has an answer to. What's to stop any one government from slowly buying up most or all of the bitcoin currency, and then simply refusing to allow the general population to trade in it, or only allowing it to be traded as they issue it, or even choosing to sell it all at once, dropping it's value by a huge margin? 
I've read a fair amount on Austrian economics, so I'm sure this is a stupid question - feel free to point out the flaw in my thinking :)

Congrats! I love that car. Good on you for holding onto some too

But if hypothetically, they aimed to destabilize the currency for good, so they suddenly released them all back into the market after purposely driving up the cost, would that not cause them to crash?

On paper, sure... but wouldn't that only make it worse when "they" flooded the market again? It seems like this could be a real flaw in the system, assuming a government entity found this to be a threat to fiat currency, and wanted to devalue it. Is there a theoretical free market fix for this?

Thanks so much! This is way easier than I thought :) Happy Thanksgiving!

Thanks again for your explanation of localbitcoins.com. I'm now the proud owner of some bitcoins! I wondered if you could explain how I can transfer my bitcoins from the site to a wallet? I have a blockchain wallet, but I'm not sure if that's best, or if it's better to have something on a local PC.

So I'm open to the idea that in an idiot,  can you spell out how I can avoid buying through an exchange and dealing with all the fees?

Inflation is defined as increasing the supply of currency. Although it will someday be deflationary assuming people continue to mine it, it is currently not. Maybe try less patronizing next time?
