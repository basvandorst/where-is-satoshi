What matters is that it was possible to get stuff from Overstock, sending bitcoins to the overstock webpage. Than who cares what overstock does with the money. Its theirs.

3 people live on an island. One of them starts a bank.
This bank can borrow money it do not have, its a FRB bank.
1 take a loan in this bank, its cheaper to loan from it than from the other guy, since it can lend out money it does not have to have, it only have to have 5% of what it lends out.
This guy now bids over the other guy on the open market, the other guy is now forced to put himself in debt so he can compete with the first guy. Now both have put themselves in debt. 
Then they need to repay the loans, but this is not possible as they got to borrow more money than they had and on top of it needs to pay interest. 
They are put in debt for the rest of their life and all the work they do from now on will pay interest to the guy who owns the bank.
 
This guy now dont need to do anything, he can now just collect the money and be the richest guy on that small planet forever since he can always create more debt and lend it out to the others on the island when needed thanks to FRB, its simple math, everyone and their children will have to go to debt and pay that debt to the banker for the rest of their lifes.
I agree with you. Bitcoin is bad. 
I like FRB it allows the smart to own the bank and the dumb to easily get cheap loans, this drives the economy so more people need to take loans, since the bank can create new money out of nothing, that makes all of them work for the smart people who creates their money with the press of a button. 
Thus power goes to the smart and educated who are responsible and take time to understand the system, power to the bankers which is where it belongs.
