You can short it (and other cryptos) on  trading apps.

    30 goto 10
It's not a credible currency because the price is too volatile.
As I said - Pretty dumb to use a currency that's worth substantially more months later.

You may as well just buy whatever you were going to buy with money as do that.


Ironic really because you just said to turn dollars or euros into bitcoins so you can spend it.


Well, no. Some might but history tells us that most people will cash in investments and diversify (assuming they don't simply cash them in to enjoy them)

Ordinary joe has a different wife than millionaire joe most of the time.
He might decide to his regret later that the shallow more attractive choice wasn't actually the best, but many people will change their car, house, clothes as a result of having more money.
To imagine they won't change their relationships is just naive.
And, as you suggest, if one really is happy the other one isn't necessarily going to feel the same way when she discovers she is rich.
The downside here, of course, is to deceive yourself that bitcoin is secret.
@_date: 2017-12-16 17:19:17
That's clearly false otherwise they wouldn't be holding a lot.
Trickling out a bit is not the same. Not talking about selling a few to buy a car.
What you need to think is, if some cunt holding millions of bitcoins decides to sell them, (a) What happens to the price - you've got to find a bunch of people who think they are worth buying and have the money  and (b) What that does to your opportunities to sell. It's simple economics really. If the supply ramps, the price will dive.

More to the point. If dollars dropped to fuck all the country (and possibly the world) would meltdown.
If bitcoin drops to fuck all, a few investors will be butthurt but that's about it.

Just imagine you have above a double-digit IQ for a second. Could you really not determine that you own bitcoin? That you bought them? How much you spent on them? What they are worth now?
You'll lose more than half if you think you're smarter than you are. Certainly if you think you're smarter than the people your partner hires.

Yeah, investing with 20/20 hindsight is always profitable (well, I bet some would still lose money)
For the rest, you have to actually have the balls to buy stuff and the money to lose. It's gambling, plain and simple.
The irony is, when they were $5000 they probably thought the same and didn't buy, and then when they were $10000 they thought the same and didn't buy. Now they're around $17000 no doubt they are not going to buy either.
Which means, if they go up, they will still be saying "Aww...I could have bought some"
Of course, at some point, when they crash down to a few cents each they'll be there "Phew...I'm glad I didn't buy any"

Pretty dumb to use a currency that's worth substantially more months later.
It will start to sink when those holding a lot start eyeing toys they want to buy with dollars or euros (which they're already starting to do) and burst when that triggers a panic amongst the rest.

The big risk is that the people who own large amounts want to cash out as they realise the huge difference between 'owning lots of bitcoin' and 'being a billionaire'
At that point it'll quickly spiral down to worthless bits and a few months or years of people gnashing their teeth and boo hooing in this subreddit. Human nature tells me they'll blame someone else, most likely someone who has won with bitcoin or a government. That's what everyone else does "Oooh, I'm fat...It's the corn growers fault!" etc
But, billionaires are used to your hate and they'll weep all the way to the bank - which is where they'll keep their billions they made from bitcoin. That and in stocks, shares, property and other investments.
Whether after that point it recovers or is ever used widely as an actual currency remains to be seen.
But the guys who cash out and start the crash will be best placed to pick up the dregs - so they could end up with all your invested speculative "get rich quick" money (in actual money) and all the bitcoin too.

You say clearly but it took you about 2 posts of making dumb shit up before you caught on. How long would it take for something that wasn't clear? A month? :D
If you're involved in bitcoin, buying or selling then you're comfortable gambling.

Oh come on. Get a grip.
This kind of wishy-washy nonsense was once said about the internet "It's without borders, Governments cannot stop it"  blah blah blah.
Now you're all wetting your panties because the FCC are having a vote - your Government owns your ass. Don't delude yourself otherwise. The best you can do is leave and find a place with another government that owns your ass (and only then to a limited sense)

Yes you can. You can short bitcoin (and a bunch of other cryptos) on many trading apps.

Because the simple, stark reality is a lot of relationships only survive because the 2 people involved feel stuck in them by circumstance. These relationships would not survive a large injection of cash or change of circumstance for one or the other.
(As an aside this is true of all relationships - it's not a great idea to tell your friends and family you are suddenly rich if they are not - ask lottery winners whose egos chose to publicise the win)
The simple fact is, a lot of people are going to think they can do better starting again, and obviously for a married couple it doesn't matter which one has made the money. i.e you tell your wife she's rich and you think she loves you, well, for a lot of people they'll find out just how much she actually did love them.
Equally many with bitcoin worth a substantial amount will be thinking they can divorce on the cheap and then enjoy their new found wealth by keeping it a secret, i.e not having to give half of it over.
Something that is a lot more difficult with traditional bank accounts (although you'd be wise not to assume the people your partner hires are that stupid - if you transferred tens of thousands out of an account you'll have to find some way of accounting for where it went)
As House put it in the eponymously titled TV series : *Sevens marry sevens, nines marry nines, fours marry fours. Maybe there’s some wiggle room if there’s enough money or if somebody got pregnant* - well, even adding in the money later changes that equation.

True. I took a dump that looked a bit like the bitcoin logo and sold it for $3million.
@_date: 2017-12-18 03:46:25
That obviously depends how the price changes.
If you bought when 1 BTC was $100 and watched it go to $20000, say, that's 200x more.
So, if you'd invested, say $5000, you'd have grossed a million.
For that to happen again, i.e for a $5000 investment (assuming the price is $20k) to make you a dollar millionaire, bitcoin would have to be worth $4million each.
I would suggest that's unlikely to happen. So yeah, in that sense you'd have to invest more now. But, if you "only" doubled your money, over these timescales that would be an incredible investment.
Bear in mind though you could lose it all.
