"es the IRS get notified if I invest 20k in mutual funds?"
if you realize the monies? yes.
You have no idea how taxes work or are reported. Stop being a shiny tax dodging ass, and pay you taxes like everyone else.

"Fear is being used by governments to control."
How about a complete sentence?
"if people buy futures and the bitcoin does what the bitcoin did this week, "
that would depend if it was long or short now, wouldn't it?
"and thats a good thing! "
institutions failing in the bitcoin investments could destroy bitcoin, or at least keep forcing it into a niche. It would likely mean large financial institutions will make there own, and that will become the legal cryptocurrency.
Bitcoin has high risk and flaws, and the sharp increase in price doesn't mean those flaws don't exist.

If I give you 100K, you pay taxes on 100k minus 10K(?). The first 10k is tax free.
If I giver you 10k a month for 10 months, you pay taxes on 100k - 10k. 
At the EOY it's the same.

"Bitcoin is coincidentally experiencing a small dip in value this week. "
It's not a small dip. The market would be on edge if it had dropped that much,
Also, not a coincidence. It's specifically due to the cancellation the fork.
Fork generate revenue. Even if on side fails. Big investors know that, so the were buying. Not fork? well, not they are selling.
The loud ignorant masses spread FUD hurts bitcoin in a number of way.
Not just value, but it underscores one big problem with distributed currencies:
enough voices, no matter how ignorant, can significantly impact it.
They need to develop a better filter.
And yes, there are many ignorant miners as well.

"There’s no underlying value"
True. Like most currencies. At least the dollar is based on it's value to trade oil.
"It’s incredibly volatile"
True, but that doesn't led to sliding to zero.
Now all points against the thing you enjoy are wrong just because they are against the thing you enjoy.

Forks create money. The fork isn't happening, so all the people who wanted to generate revenue are pulling out, and it makes bitcoin look like its run be a ship of fools.
IMO, all this comes from the loud ignroati who did not understand the economic impact of splits and instead spout of alarmist nonsense generally coupled with a surface level understand of how bitcoin math works, and fear of change.
@_date: 2017-11-12 06:16:48
"They couldn't give two shits about SegWit. "
yes, Segwit specifically, but a large major fork is a revue generator. So there would have been opportunity to make some money, especially for the big investors.
When the loud ignorati can influence your currency, it's not a good sign for the currencies future.

No. That not true at all. It happen in other decentralized system all the fucking time. I've done it with global decentralized financial systems*.
*Yes they exist and hsve from before bitcoin. No you don't hear about it becasue it's not directly tied to currency and require reading 1200 page systems books, regularly,  that while I enjoy it, many, many people do not. That's ok.

You probably don't actually understand it. 
How will it influence the oil exchange through OPEC?
How will ti be used to create infrastructure in developing worlds through needed ag exchanges?
I could go on and on. You have no clue about the actual economic of a digital currency.
I was on a team that created digital currency in Zambia in the 90s. 
You know what happned? peope with actual power didn't like it and killed ot drove out of the country the people who owned the bank.
And this wasn't currency that the people were creating, it was digital representation of what the bank had in its vaults, but no individual owner account becasue they weren't needed.
Oh, can give suitcases of untraceable cash to people with guns? well then, they don't like that.

Then you are a fool.
The market is not logical, the best tech does not always win, and for some reason losing a shit ton of money, but not the same shit ton as last year, is enough to be worth billions. The right person speaking out his ass can change the markets, and the right person saying something in casual conversation can get interpreted and impact markets.
Engineers do math. Developers make solid data driven decisions*. The market is not because its mostly driven by ignorant and emotional large apes and their inability to project into the future or understand big numbers. Being easily manipulate by tweets doesn't help either.

It's money. It will never be fair or free in and of itself.
If you don't regulate it, it will get abused, and it's not as hard as you may think.
Very free markets lead to radically destabilized results. If you economics are based on it, it can have devastating results on a Macro scale.
