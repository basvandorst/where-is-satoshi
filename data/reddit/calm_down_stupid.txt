Wtf, I just bought 90k USD worth of pip. It uses pip chains which replaces blockchain, the blockchain is old tech, pip chains is what bill gates uses, the guy who sold them to me knows all about it and assured me my 90k will be worth several million when the blockchain computer gets switched off due to knifes and forks. Pip chain is the future, he warned me about bitcoin people talking shit.

You gambled, you lost. 
The advice has always been DON'T invest more than you can afford to lose.
The advice has always been DON'T  leave your coins sitting on a exchange.
The advice has always been if you DON'T own the keys you DON'T own the coins.

Unlike butfinex gamblers I feel sorry for you and your friend, you have genuinely lost money to a scam unlike the gamblers who were warned again and again against leaving money on exchanges but chose to chase the easy money aware of previous hacks . 
You need to contact the police and ( not sure how it works in your country) and get a crime number and then contact apple. I personally think apple will just try to fob you off though, pretty sure they will have somthing in small print saying they can't be liable for losses due to dodgy apps.

Yup, let's just allow a company to create 70 million tokens out of nowhere and then all pretend they are worth 1usd each. 
Bitcoin has been over run by banking mentality, "we lost some money, that's no good, we like earning money from doing fuck all, how about we just print ourselves another 70 million so we can pretend we never gambled and lost"

A lot of banks already do charge you a monthly fee to have a bank account, this fee is usually offset though with other benefits that a "free" account doesn't give you, for example, travel insurance, breakdown cover, better interest rate.

Unfortunately that has what it has become. Been drifting that way for some time. The recent butfinex hack has made it clear in my opinion that the main use of btc is by people who have no interest in bitcoin as a currency but as a tradable token along with any shitcoin as long as it listed on a exchange. Have seen a couple comments from long term btc guys who are really disappointed with the way things are, gone are the people who actively trying to promote btc, gone are the people who want to spend btc on real world items, gone are the people trying to set up small btc business. They have been replaced by hodle and worse, by wannabe city traders thinking this crypto thing is easy money. 
Personally, I hope the value of btc crashes through the floor, down to a couple bucks would be good. I have hardly any coin left, I SPENT them so a massive price crash would be good for me, it would mean the greedy money grabbing asshole traders would lose a fortune and boy would that make me happy:-)
Btc has become the plaything of just the kinda people I had hoped btc would damage, the rich, the bankers, the city trader types. 
Rip btc.

Maybe if bitcoin was to put more effort into being a useful SPENDABLE currency rather than a tradable store of value then we would have a more stable price rather than be at the whim of traders on exchanges.

It's getting out of control and lurching towards disaster, a coin created by debt ? Holy fuck. Seems we have crossed the line were people realise the SHITCOIN tokens they are trading are worthless ( well bitcoin worth millions so this SHITCOIN worth something right?) And now when a bunch of traders lose they welcome coins backed by debt so they recover their own losses. Crypto is sliding across a dangerous line with debt backed coins.

There are already a shit load of coins mostly made to be tradable tokens for exchange gamblers. Have a look at poloniex, potcoin ? Piggycoin ? Are these real change the world currencies or just shit tokens being used by gamblers betting against each other ? One day there will be millions of coins ? You include shit like onecoin? 
It shit like this, scam coins, premined bullshit, even well intentioned coins becoming nothing but a token store of value to be traded by people who see nothing but $$ .
Bitcoin and the possibilities it offered the world is being strangled and killed by people who want it to be nothing but a graph on a exchange.

I can understand how normal people get sucked into this kinda bollox, especially in the early days when there is not much independent information and I commend OP for his work trying to educate and add to the number of reports that expose this shit onecoin scam but anyone investing now with the wealth of negative reports is foolish at best.

I don't have a couple btc to be patient with and there no way I'm buying any at the inflated price, the real world value of btc is much lower than current "exchange" value and I will explain why I think this.
Real world value cones from the number of real people wanting to use btc as a currency v how many are available, the number of people interested in using btc as a currency is shrinking very rapidly, the number of places to spend coin is shrinking and this implies to me that value should be slowly going down.
The dollar value of btc is artificially high due to the easy money being made by traders, and not just the moron traders who been filling this sub over the last few days but the real traders, investment bankers, pushing 10's of millions around in this wonderful new market where they don't have to worry about real world physical assets,  in this market they can physically own and store a billion dollars worth on their computer.
But here the downside for the traders, it's very vulnerable to hacks, and I believe it will get worse, just as it easy for the traders to move around vast sums of money , it also easy for thieves and criminals. The traders care nothing about the tech it's self and being greedy and selfish think it not their problem to invest in tech to secure bitcoin while the criminal side are working overtime to find ways to take advantage of vulnerabilities. And it not just skillful hacks that is being encouraged by the get rich quick mentality, it's the scam coin, the blatant bullshit onecoin being sold on the back of bitcoin. The crypto world is no longer about innovation, it about making $$$$ by any means.
Yes dude I pessimistic about the future of bitcoin, I really think it has failed to live up to its potential. As Metallica said, sad but true.

It offered relatively easy to use, no fees, way of giving someone a dollar on a couple very high profile websites.  Look, I'm not here to argue for them, i don't give a shit about changetip as a company or platform but I do think the ability to send small amounts to friends via high profile websites like twitter, fee free was a huge plus in bitcoins armoury and if we lose that then it a backwards step.

Sometimes people need to be told straight and I'm losing patience with people posting how it wasn't their fault, how they were just about to withdraw from the exchange.

Not only did I spend, I also gave a load away. Thats what people used to do, i believed in btc as a new currency to rivel the fiat being issued by governments and controlled by banks, btc offered many benefits to people around the world, giving them control over their"money"
Yes. Spent some, to reward the people going to the trouble of adding btc as a payment option, driving the bitcoin economy.
Yes I gave some away, to spread bitcoin to a bigger audience, getting people to download wallets.
Unfortunately btc attracted the greedy, the people who care nothing about what bitcoin has to offer in technology or as a new currency but only about how many dollars they can make trading magic internet tokens. 
But whatever, I have hardly any coin left, I think btc has failed and now the get rich quick mentality seems to be in the majority then I firmly believe we will just see scam after scam, more pump and dump alts, more hacks, limited development, unless it by banks using block chain technology but not bitcoin.

The reason why I brought silk road into it was because you named open bizar as a whole new thing that was just opening up and proof that bitcoin use by consumers to buy stuff was on the rise. When in fact in the past silk road was doing good business ( what they sold is irrelevant ) and I expect MORE business than open bazar. 
Dude, you the one digging a hole with your inability to see or recognise anything that suggests not everything is perfect in the bitcoin world. Knowing fools like you will be left holding the bag  IF bitcoin ever collapses letting others with their eyes open cash out is quite reassuring.  thanks fool :)

What ???
"You can buy almost anything today with bitcoin" ? Really ?? Not where I live. In fact the one coffee shop that did stopped over a year ago. Now there is nowhere. 
Volume is not relevant ?? Wtf ?? Volume is hugely important, if volume of bitcoin transacted by retailers is on a downward trend then that is not good for bitcoin and for you to say otherwise is ridiculous and indicative of the mentality shown by some members of this sub.
What does my comment about open bizar suggest ??   I can guarantee there is no motive, I am a long time bitcoiner who is worried that bitcoin is possibly at a tipping point, but you stick on your tin hat and acuse anyone who posts a slightly negative post of having hidden motives.

So using second layer Lightning network which will route via a small number of large well funded  centralised hubs is scaling without destroying decentralisation ?? And to be fair why do you need to try move the focus onto onchain scaling ? Closing your eyes to your own problems and instead try to move the focus onto something else is just sticking your head in the sand
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:53:32
Well that's a insightful comment and relevant to the discussion, thanks for your contribution.
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:08:57
Because the exchange you buying your LN tokens from has already converted BTC to LN before you buy them. This exchange will have a large well funded  node/hub/bank branch to cover your "purchase" and being a large well funded node/hub/bank branch, any transaction you make on LN will probably get routed via them. But don't worry you keeping the actual BTC network free for the big boys :-)
@_date: 2018-09-02 19:00:58
Exchanges move tons of bitcoin everyday on their own internal networks. Do they ? That's not how Blockchain works. If the BTC not moved onchain, it's not moved. It's surprising you happy to compare a exchanges own private internal ledger and lightning network and still believe BTC the best cuss it's so decentralised...
@_date: 2018-09-02 11:48:27
I can use shapeshift to convert LTC (or a huge variety of coins) to BTC at anytime. The point is, if you cannot send me the LN BTC into my BTC wallet is it really BTC ? If you have to convert it from the token that is used by the LN network(that may well be labelled BTC) to a different network before it is received by a BTC wallet how is it BTC ? Why is it different from buying LTC with BTC, using the LTC network then when you done swap it back to BTC by using a proper BTC transaction ?
@_date: 2018-09-02 20:34:58
I would of hoped the exchange would charge you the same price per BTC for sending to LN or a real BTC wallet address.  
@_date: 2018-09-02 13:44:13
Good reply :-) and correct. Unlike LTC ETH ect the LN token is not recognised by any exchange or service, it is only used on the LN and is only tradable for BTC so its value is pegged to BTC. But that doesn't make it "real" BTC or at least untill it is converted back to being BTC.
At the end of the day it's how you want to interpret what BTC is. 
This post was saying the the scaling problem had been solved and the debate was over, job done. But I think that is bs to be fair. There is still many problems to be solved before anyone can say the scaling debate is over. 
@_date: 2018-09-02 10:01:18
Oh that's great then, so we go to a exchange to buy LN coins (with fiat) so we can use the LN network to send our LN coins probably via the same well funded exchanges hub to another LN wallet, just so we don't use the precious BTC Blockchain.  (Try exchanging exchanges for banks lol)  super decentralisation !!
How is this scaling BTC ? It's not using BTC. Not using somthing isn't scaling it !!

@_date: 2018-09-02 11:04:26
I struggle to see how it BTC in the linked video, 
In video guy buys LN tokens with fiat, which he sends to a LN address. Where is the BTC ? If he wants BTC in a BTC wallet he needs to convert the LN token back to BTC via a real BTC transaction. How is it different from him buying LTC, using the litcoin network and when he done using shapeshift to convert to BTC?
I have a bitcoin address, can you send me $1 to it from the LN network ? Yes if you convert it back to BTC by using the Blockchain, no if you use the LN network and keep it a LN token. Just as you can't send me LTC to my BTC address unless you trade it for BTC.

"The economy is bigger than the loans" "and it works with fiat too" 
What if I was to tell you cash accounts for only 3% of the "money" and 97% has been digitally created by banks ( under the guise of loans).
What if I was to tell you just how close we came to this whole shitshow collapsing in the last financial crisis and how did the governments/banks stop the whole house of cards collapsing that time ? Yup they just created even more money out of thin air !! 
When all the bitcoin are mined then there is no option to make up more, that's kinda one of the big points of bitcoin. Can you imagine how quickly it would end in disaster if the bitcoin economy was just a financial economy based on loans ????  Night night bitcoin.
For most of mankind's history the charging of interest was considered a bad thing and if not illigal very discouraged, in the mid/late 20th century bankers twisted shit in their favour, selling us all down the river. Let's try not let them fuck btc too.
Edit, I just had a look at a couple of your other comments and it's obvious you consider yourself a trader. We have very different views, maybe it's because I'm a little older and realise there more to life than making easy money. Thing is, what kinda world would it be if everyone was a trader ? Making money from nothing ? That's unsustainable. But whatever, we have different views so let's leave it at that. Late here I'm off to sleep.

Also illuminating is you get downvotes for even mentioning the problem of interest. Kinda proves to me that this sub is not what it used to be and the average mindset of its users has changed for the worse. Used to be that btc was the solution to the shit show banks/governments had made of the currency system, btc would be made by the people, for the people. Not a fucking toy for high risk speculation in manipulated markets by soulless traders chasing big $$ profits. (Backed up by the plebs who have somehow been convinced being a hodlers ( or bag holder) is a great idea) wtf happened bitcoin ?
Remember the days when we talked about a bitcoin economy? When we celebrated a business using bitcoin as a payment option ? What happened ?? Nowadays it's "bitcoin not for coffee" , don't spend it just buy some and watch its value move , if it goes up post a picture of a roller coaster and rejoice that IF you sold for fiat you would be so much $$$ richer. If it goes down post a picture of a rollercoaster and rejoice that you are a holder and not going to sell anyway :-(
Take a look at bitcoin beginners, I remember when that sub used to be full of new posts from new people, sure it still a active sub but it's slowdown suggests to me less and less new people are getting onboard. This sub also, so many subscribers but why are the posts so often from accounts under 6 months old ? Are the older more long term bitcoin people getting the feeling bitcoin is running out of steam ? Or that it's not lived up to its potential? Or that it became big enough and profitable enough to have been slowly and stelthily taken over by the very people who are responsible for fucking up the world economy ?? High risk, high stake investment bankers/gamblers ?.

If someone dies or losses their private key then those coins are stuck and effectively lost.
Some say that if someone losses their private key and thus losses their coin it is good for everyone else as this limits the supply even further and as a consequence increases the value of the remaining coins.

It is not in the public main stream consciousness. It's becoming less risky in the eyes of investors which is I expect the reason behind the price highs. IMHO I'm waiting for some of those investers to take their profits and cash out, will trigger more to sell and I fully expect to see the price drop 10/20% in the next couple weeks.

" The interest could be earned by the BTC moving on exchanges or another business. " How is that ?
You sound like a professional banker , if I shuffle this shit around enough I can convince people there is more than there actually is :-(
Look , I'm sure people will loan out btc for profit, humans, we suck, we would rather sit on our ass in a big house while others slaved away earning our living for us in the form of interest payments. Trouble is if you try and treat btc like fiat you going to run into trouble very, very fast.

Depends, I had some chips on the way home and tried using one of them plastic forks and it was far to soft and flimsy for the job, a hard fork would have been much better but then the convenience of a soft fork over having to carry around a hard fork incase you fancy some chips probably swings it in the favour of the soft fork. 
Hope this helps.

People say don't leave your btc on exchanges and store them in a wallet. OK this only works for holders.
It works for everyone except traders. If I want to buy something I use my wallet, ( you know that  crazy notion that a crypto currency should be used as a currency), if I want to store my bitcoin I use a wallet. The only fuckers who leave their bitcoin on exchanges are traders who care little about what bitcoin is or can be. All traders care about is $

The % of people who see bitcoin as a alternative to a "fucked up and unsustainable monetary system" is shrinking all the time while the % of people who see bitcoin as a easily tradable token they can gamble with on exchanges to try to get some more of that fucked up and unsustainable money is growing rapidly and has been for some time now

It's not a problem, I just noticed it at the start of the video. Can be a real pain shipping overseas and not just because of the shipping costs. Ages ago I won a ecig in a online competition being run from the US. It turned up with a bill for import duty that exceeded the value of the ecig !! I refused to except it but then a couple days later they delivered it while I was out, the bill attached to it had cancelled written on the outside. Sweet I thought untill about a month later when I had another bill threatening legal action unless I paid up !!!! Fortunately the company that supplied the e cig took responsibility for it and I haven't heard anymore about it.
If you wondering why the costs were so high, the shipping company had "estimated" the value and then charged a fee for this estimation and for setting up a import tax account for me. Legalised daylight robbery.

I was around at the time of gox, hacks of other exchanges too , come on bitfinex was not very long ago. If you followed the golden rules of bitcoin and kept your own coins in your own wallet....
The current situation is far more unsettling, a possible hard fork with BU and core is far far more worrying than a load of gamblers/speculators losing coin because they prefer to leave coins on a exchange so they can dollar profit from btc.

Although i totally get what you are saying. Saying it has a transaction fee of 50 cents implies that all transactions have the same fee and we know that's not true and we should not imply or even suggest that it is.
One of the biggest hurrdles for people sending bitcoin from their wallets for the first time is fees, unless they have studied bitcoin and really researched it they may be very surprised that the fee is in no way a set 50cents lol the fee can vary so widely from so many different factors stating a set fee is really not a good idea.

It was noble, but then it slowly curupted those involved, they no longer wanted a new currency that was out of the control of the greedy bankers, they started to see $ signs, flash cars and all the things $ could buy, they started to act like the bankers themselves, sitting on their ass watching computer screens and charts of how much $ they could sell for. As this was happening new investers came along, high risk high gain traders, the kinda people who previously wrapped up debts and sold them on causing worldwide financial crisis. They loved this new bitcoin thing, they could easily manipulate the markets, they didn't have to worry much about regulation, it could all be done on a computer. Easy $$$
Most development kinda stalled, people were incouraged to hodl, they were told " bitcoins not for coffee" don't spend it or use it, just look at it and watch how its value increases, no-one cared as the fees went up and transactions started to fail, all the small people just hodl'd anyway and the big money was on exchanges, the rich just bought their transactions.
The path was set and the eventual disaster came, first the old wallet holders started to cash out while the price was good, this was offset by eager people wanting in on this investment of a lifetime, then the first of the big traders started to take his $profits the price started to fall, the fall started to trigger other traders to sell and the price fall even more, the ordinary people didn't have their bitcoin on exchanges and so even those that wanted to sell were behind all the traders (some started to realise that being a hodler was actually another name for bag holder and they felt letdown, most though just kept up the mantra if HODL and swore never to sell).
Ah you get the picture, bitcoin was not supposed to be like this, remember the pizza ? Remember when people went crazy when a new retailer offered btc as a payment option ? All we get now is posts with the value of btc in $.
It's all about the $, how much $ can you make out buying and selling bitcoin. The idea that bitcoin could replace the $ ? Yup crazy wasn't it :-(

Good to see there are still some people out there using bitcoin, supporting the bitcoin economy, supporting retailers who go to the trouble of adding bitcoin, giveing bitcoin real world value.
I used to, but I can no longer support the hodlers and investers who are only interested in $.
I see hodlers like people in a bicycle race, the old school bitcoin guys are at the front taking turns to lead the race putting in lots of work and energy keeping a fast pace while the hodlers sit in the middle of the pack refusing to take their turn leading, get near the end of the race and the old guys have spent a lot of their energy dragging the race forward, the hodlers have saved all their energy and race to the front saying how clever they have been not using up any energy just riding on the back of other peoples efforts.
So yeah, I kinda a bit pissed off, I been around bitcoin for years, not a rich person so never had much but what I did have I used, I bought stuff, I gave it away l, I helped grow what I hoped would be a new world currency that would take the "money" out of the hands of the greedy and selfish,  I was wrong. Bitcoin is now in the hands of the greedy and selfish and it even encourages  greedy behaviour now.

Where did the bitcoins go to ? 
When the guy or whoever said they would pay you in bitcoin, how did they suggest to you it would work ?
With bitcoin you need to have a wallet, your wallet gives you a address ( think of your address like a bank account number ) and who ever is sending you bitcoin needs that address.
There are a coupe types of wallet, a online wallet ( not recommended) and a personal wallet you hold on your mobile device or computer. Did you open/download a wallet to receive this bitcoin ?
Where does the message you got saying you received the bitcoin come from ?

I tried it out and it works like you would expect a tipbot too but its onchain and it charges a flat fee of 100 bits so for example to send 500 bits you need to add a extra 100 to cover the transaction. It seems like a odd way to run a tipbot if you used the old bitcointip or changetip or doge ect but i think the bots owner wanted it to be onchain so no trust issues on depositing to a bot. But in my opinion I'm ok with loading a bot with like 10 or 20 USD worth for fee free offchain instant transactions. But whatever, it's great to see someone putting time and effort into creating a bitcoin bitcoin tipbot.
Edit, spelling.

I quit last year, quit smoking in Jan of last year. Trouble is I used my btc to buy vape gear and juice, lots of juice. Was probably a bad time to use up my coin but fuck it, in the last 18 months i'v only smoked like 4 or 5 rollups instead of the 30 odd a day. 
No regrets .

It's completely up to you. You probably not going to get unbiased opinion on should you buy bitcoin on a bitcoin sub.
Now, later, never. It's your decision, but remember ( and IMHO even more relevant right now) Don't invest more than you can afford to lose.
@_date: 2017-03-12 19:20:01
Faucets are incredibly low paying and you are probably better of using the time you spend on them doing something else. Check out or maybe other micro job subs like , some pay out in bitcoin but if not then save the money and exchange for bitcoin. Or just get a regular job and convert some of the money into bitcoin. 
As for tips. The tipbot no longer works. Sending small amounts onchain is not very cost effective due to high fees so that not going to happen anymore :-(
Best of luck getting started, it is a pain getting those first few bits but it's worth exploring.

You may struggle to trade Amazon gift cards for btc as Amazon gift cards have a bit of a reputation for being bought with stolen credit cards.

Ah ok, this is something I've been trying to get to the bottom of today. I think it quite confusing.
I gave a example in another post of Mr X using faucets and withdrawing 0.001 btc each day into his wallet for a thousand days untill he had a whole bitcoin V Mr Y who just buys a freshly minted single bitcoin and the difference between the fees the two ( Mr X and Mr Y) would have to pay to transfer their bitcoin.
This is useful in real world situation when people like OP are getting lots of small donations or transactions. 
Mr X and his bitcoin is potentially worth a lot less than Mr Y and his bitcoin because when he needs to spend it he going to get hit with a huge fee. 1 btc does not always equal 1 btc

I think your assuming I'm not a white male.

You missed the most important bit in your haste to jump on my "white male" RICH. Rich white male . 
Good luck buying that 1 satoshi, if you could link me to a exchange that sells 1 satoshi at a time I would like to see that. Bitcoin is not for the poor, it is tradable store of value for the wealthy.
Edit, also, " find it interesting that you went to the very top of my example to make your point " umm nobi didn't I said 10 to 100 and then said 100, 100 was in your range of "small" amounts is it not ?

I could say what is it about my post you don't understand ? I'm not talking about spending small amounts . I want to know how much X would pay in fees compared to y for 1 single transaction that would get confirmed in roughly the same amount of time, preferably quite a quick time.
@_date: 2017-01-16 17:04:40
Made a post about this kind of situation earlier. If you keep changing the address everytime you get a donation, when you come to spending your coin you may get hit with some rather large fees. 
People do say to use a new address for each transaction but I think this needs to be rethought when the transactions may be small ( tip kinda size) .
Changetip used to offer a offchain tip button thing which was ideal for your situation but they are no longer do this so I guess just change the address every 10 or so donations ? 
Edit, spelling

Worst case scenario, Mr X spends all day on faucets ect and withdraws to a fresh address everytime he hits the minimum withdraw (say 0.0001 for ease ), after 1000 transactions he finally has 1 btc.
Mr Y though buys a freshly mined 1 btc from a miner. 
If I offer to buy Mr X coin how much more ( worst case scenario, but using the same calculations for fees as Mr Y) would he have to pay ?

I would love to see bitcoin much more widely distributed but unfortunately those that are wealthy now in fiat will be the ones that benefit the most from bitcoin.

And you want to be the best uncle ever read the books to him, as he gets older find books that teach early writing skills, early maths skills and do those with him too. Give him the tools to succeed not a magic internet money that could well be worthless in 18 years time.

I spent bitcoin back in the day, lots of people did, it gave it value and increased adoption. 
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:22:28
Or maybe it's you who is desusional thinking a crypto currency you are invested in can't be used anywhere as a currency, even at its own conference.
@_date: 2017-01-30 11:37:35
I had a look at your other posts because this one makes no sense.
So you have a store that sells very expensive watches for btc only. That just rings alarm bells. The unreverasble nature of bitcoin makes this a very risky deal for the buyer. I'm not saying you aren't legit but not in a million years would I buy a very expensive watch from a unknown website using btc. Anyone who does is in my opinion a fool.
@_date: 2017-01-19 10:20:46
Um no but I been following and using bitcoin for years now and if everyone had the same "hodl!" Mentality as you bitcoin would never have got as far as it has. Yes I spent bitcoin ! Big surprise ! And the fact you question anyone actually using btc highlights a very real problem :-(
@_date: 2017-08-19 20:41:47
Yup, I'm sick of it. The level of blinkered craziness has reached new levels.
I posted the exact same post over in I don't have a "side" the point of the post is I like most people have both coins so I'm happy for both coins to succeed but it seems with the vocal few you are either one or the other.
Serious, go check out the other post, fucking crazy ! One guy is convinced I'm sone sort of core infiltrator and the evidence is in the way I write ! Fucking lunitic. Kind of done with bitcoin on Reddit. Too many crazy paranoid fuckwits ( in fairness there does seem more assholes on if today is anything to go by)

If you do take the harddrive to someone to recover the dat file, make sure they are reputable. From your emails and stuff do you have the address so you can see how much is in there ? Even if you don't , tell the people trying to recover your dat file you do , they will be less inclined to steal the coin if they know you can watch the address. If they do recover the file for you, send the coin to a new address asap.

As head of internet cyber crime for the FBI I have access to all the latest tricks these dastardly criminals use. Although I have remotely accessed your PC and this looks like a new virus we have not seen before. I shouldn't but as a fellow redditor I am willing to personally help you. The hackers have locked the files I need to access with your debit and credit card numbers as passwords ( this is a common trick) if you pm me your full name as it appears on the cards along with the numbers then I can unlock the files and save your files and bitcoin. This has all the hallmarks of a inside job, it would probably be best not to contact your bank for a week or so untill I can "lockdown" and secure your accounts before the hackers get at them, if they work at the bank it could tip them off. We need to get in this asap before they steal all your money.

And what's so wrong with 0.056 ? It's a bitcoin conference ffs ! 
This is a perfect example of why, 8 years after starting up as a crypto currency, that bitcoin has become nothing more than a store of value ( and it's questionable how stable a store of value it is when in real world application's like buying stuff, at its own conference things are advertised, priced and sold for USD)
It's like burger king , 8 years after opening their first store, having a conference and the stalls selling MacDonalds ( unless you specifically ask for a burger king or Pepsi having a conference and as a default serving Coke !!!
"Nobody said that you can't pay with BTC there" and that picture doesn't say you can. Which is the problem.

It something I was thinking about today when looking at the balance on the wallet I have on my mobile. Even though it says I have "X" amount of bitcoin I can't be sure how much I have available to spend untill I actually try to spend it. With quite high fees and if fees get even higher then how much disparity between balance shown V balance available to spend could there be if the wallet contains lots of inputs from lots of small transactions.
I was then thinking could wallets show the " available" balance ( total amount of btc -the fees required to send) but then I though that would only work if you wanted to send all of your coin and if you made smaller transactions you would have more . I can't see a easy solution ! Just because my wallet days I have 1 btc , it doesn't mean I have as much available as someone else with 1 btc meaning 1 btc does not always equal 1 btc !!

This is at a bitcoin conference, people there know what the current value of btc is , bitcoiners obsessed with the value of bitcoin. But hey sure price things up in local fiat too, no problem, but here of anywhere things should be priced and sold in btc first with a local fiat as a option, not the default.

The subscription box industry as far as I see it relies on repeat business supplying the same goods or very closely related goods. This guy is offering a 1 off box.
Look, good luck to him but IMHO I believe he would ship more units if he stated the contents of the boxes ( assuming they offer value for money and products people want). I wouldn't send btc to a stranger in return for a random box that more then likely contain things I don't really want and who's value is considerably less than what I paid.

Dude, I have suffered anxiety before and it's horrible, im fortunate in a way as I know what triggers it but sometimes I can't avoid it and it turns a very average, very normal rational guy into a babbling mess. 
I would encourage you to do the video yourself. Write a script and plan it well. You can do it. 
If you do the video or not, talk to a close family member about your anxiety and ask them for help when you feel a situation may trigger it, having someone there who already understands you will calm you massively.

Yup, mycelium fine. Just don't leave them on exchanges. It's crazy that people still think it's better to leave coins on exchanges because they don't want the "responsibility". Exchanges been "hacked" in the past and they will be " hacked" in the future.

Ha ha ! OK will go back and edit that. You know what I getting at though, I tried to make the example simple to understand and was hoping someone would give a exact answer in how much each person would pay in fees. If the difference is as big as I think it is ( I have basic bitcoin knowledge but certainly no expert) then I think we need to rethink the advice people are given about always using new address for each transaction. If the transaction is small then maybe the advice should be to reuse a address or maybe have a "dust" address you reuse when receiving small amounts. ( I'm assuming that inputs into a single address gets merged when they get resent???) So when you want to spend them your fee is not ridiculously high.

Think you going about this the wrong way, if you got some bitcoin merch then list what you get in your box for X amount of btc and you may get some business but I doubt many will send btc to a random guy for a random box that may not even show up and if I does is probably going to contain items of lesser a value than the btc sent.

It kinda depends on how much it's being used. If there is demand and it is turning over a lot of transactions then 1% but if there is not the demand and the operator charges more say 5% or more then that in itself could stifle demand. It's not a easy choice for the operator but if I had one I would try and run it at the lowest fee possible to get people to use it, maybe even at a loss for 6 months, just go build a user base.

@_date: 2016-11-19 21:08:06
I was waiting for someone to say market price ! I have to disagree. I feel the btc/USD conversion ratio is driven more by speculation from existing users than demand from new users. I also feel that in the last year and maybe a little longer btc has been used much more as a tradable store of value  than a currency which has driven the price . I honestly don't believe it's because of more people getting onboard.
Transactions fees I think are other factors not related to number of active users but I'm really a noob so I woulr like to know more  reasons
Network hash rate, bigger investment from groups already heavily invested pushing it up?  New users coming in are not buying mining hardware.
I don't know, maybe btc is growing more in other countries ( I feel this sub is quite heavy with USA/UK users and maybe the growth is out of those areas, India and China for example that will be using different media that I'm not reading ??
@_date: 2016-11-14 18:12:41
If you been mining since 2010 and not sold you must have quite the stash :-)

@_date: 2016-11-13 17:20:18
Yup, others have said it but it very important, do NOT give anyone anything that may be the private key. Also look for a string of 12 or so words , they will not make sense and be very random, ( also do NOT give this to anyone) .
There is no rush to sort this out, the btc will not disappear. Go slow, learn as much as you can, if he was a early adopter and been mining for some time you could be talking a LOT of money.
Remember though that btc is unreverasble , if someone gets control of them and moves them then they are pretty much lost so be careful who you trust.

i love btc but if you new to it you will probably want to convert to usd anyway and the bitcoin option may well not be straight forward (setting up a wallet, then signining up to a exchange to sell with all the fuck about that comes with) so fuck it, it may be worth just taking the 600 hit and have it wired staright to a bank account

Well you seem to be getting a positive response so go for it, best of luck :-)
I do feel though however that when it comes down to it people are going to be very nervous about "locking" their coin and will choose very short times making it all a bit pointless.
Personally, I can see no benefit from it, in fact I only see the negative of not having access to something that you may want to use. Of course if people are saying they can not control themselves and need to make their coin unspendable to stop themselves spending them I wonder how the fuck did they ever get the money together to invest in bitcoin to start with lol !!

I see you are going to make me work for this..
OK no problem, point 1 consists of 19 words, point 2 has 22, point 3 has 31 and point 4 consists of 25. 
During the study it was noted that all 4 points started very similarly with 3 words in bold print.

It's the storage solution I use and haven't had a problem, I would write that seed down though, if you have a old book that you know on one will throw away on your bookshelf, write 1 word at the bottom of every 10th page just as a backup. 
I also have mycelium on my "current" mobile with a small amount so I can get a price check and have a little spending btc too.
Phones don't last forever though, very recently I got a old phone out of the "odd shit" drawer switched it on to see if there was any photos I hadn't backed up and it went into a start up loop ended up putting a screwdriver through it to make sure no one could get any info off it and binned it.

If you fancy a gamble, send me 2btc and then sweat it out for a week wondering if I will send it back then in 7 days I will return 1btc.
This way you get all the excitement of the gamble, all the regret of the gamble and you at least get some of your money back which is probably a better result than you going to get with a traditional gambling website.

A paper wallet that he has to wait untill he 18 to cash out is not a fun gift.
Look this so it full of bitcoin fanboys me included but some of us are a little more realistic than others. In 18 years bitcoin could be worth a million per coin , it could be worth 50k per coin, it could be worth 3k a coin, it could be worth 50cents per coin it and it a very real possibility that it could be worth absolutely nothing. 
The best gift you can give that child is your time.
If you happen to be the cool uncle who drives a Ferrari and dates super models due to his massive fortune he made from bitcoin then all the better, but the true gift you can give will always be your time

Most of them are a complete waste of time, I remember one faucet I looked at a while back and to reach the minimum withdraw amount you would have needed to click on the site every hour continuously 24 hours a day for like 6 months !!
If you ever find one that is worth doing let me know lol but in the meantime the most cost effective and easiest way to get btc is buy them :-( there really is no such thing as a free lunch I'm afraid.

Yup and last night while hitch hiking home I got picked up by a bus full of playboy bunnies on their way back to the playboy mansion. Apparently old Hugh can no longer get it up so the girls begged me to give each of them a good servicing one after the other. Well being a gentleman I couldn't refuse and after 16hours of nonstop shagging we arrived at my destination. I said goodbye to the girls who all cried and begged me to stay but I told them that I had to go due to my job as a secret agent fighter pilot and that I had a urgent mission this morning to save the world from certain doom. 
Maybe when you sorted out your financial situation we could meet on my secret island and swap stories.

I just checked the charts and the most it moved was $50.
So on a product that is marked at $ 50 that's a maximum difference at the highest disparity of around 6 or 7% ? Not quite as sensational is it. And of course If the price really took off or hit the floor they could of always adjusted the price ! Fuck sake !

Mining isn't viable, hasn't been for years. You could try jobs4bitcoin if you have any skills you could use online but to be honest the easiest way is just buy a little but I totally understand ( and I think it's something this sub forgets) that for a lot of people, having spare money to buy into bitcoin is a fantasy, just getting from month to month paying the bills comes first.

I don't know how much truth there is to it but I heard that they had a list of addresses linked to gambling websites and other sites linked to possibly illigal activity and if your coin has been passed through one of these addresses you risk getting your account closed.
Like I said I dunno if this is true.

More interested in the difference in cost rather than speed of transactions between the 2 coins. So X and Y would use the same calculations for working out the fee so each would confirm at the same time or is the coin with lots of dust be less attractive to a miner to pick up the transaction ?? Is that possible another disadvantage of a coin made from many transactions ?

Supload is a fairly new service that hosts images just like imgur for example but shares it's and revenue with its users by using bitcoin as a payment channel, of course the payout is tiny but better than a faucet.
Not sure what it is you dislike about it ? That it's a new service taking on established image sharing sites using bitcoin to share it's profits with users ? Seems like a perfect example of ways btc can take on established business and I think it's great.

No, get them off coin base.
People going to tell you to get a trazor and stuff and never connect to the internet again lol !  Will be good advice but you don't need to go to over the top.
Do you have a old android phone laying around unused ? If yes, then factory reset it, let it update and then install mycelium, write down the seed, keep it somewhere safe and then transfer your bitcoin from coin base to your mycelium wallet. Disconnect from the internet and turn off the phone. Put the phone somewhere safe and you got your bitcoin stored away nice and safe. 
If anyone with more experience knows a problem or issue with this then I'd be happy to hear it as this the method I use and it been OK but I'm not a expert. 
@_date: 2016-12-28 16:38:43
If they never heard of bitcoin before prob not good idea to send em bitcoin ! But I know what you mean, changetip often got bashed on this sub but it was a usefully service.
I think realistically you have to get people to download a wallet first thing when talking about bitcoin, mycelium is so easy to use on android it's the one I try to get people to install if they genuinely interested.

Forget mining, unless you have a time machine to go back 6 years.

Dude ! Forget mining lol ! Unless you have millions to invest and can build a farm in a country/area with very cheap electricity then it really is a non starter.
Your wallet stores your private key, which controls your bitcoin address letting you move your coin. If you are new and have a android phone I recommend mycelium ( download from Google playstore) it's easy to use and user friendly and pretty secure.
Don't be put off because you can't mine ! Everyone when first looking into bitcoin wants to mine lol but it really just is not feasible anymore and hasn't been for quite some time.
@_date: 2017-01-19 11:23:55
Then be the first and hopefully others will follow.
My original comment was trying to get a confirmation that btc was excepted as the picture just shows a price in USD.
It soon became a perfect example if what's going wrong with bitcoin and this sub though, deweydb thinks I'm delusional for thinking bitcoin can be used as a payment option ! Holy shit !! 
Look, good luck to you and it's great to see people creating  business in the bitcoin space but I worry for the future of this whole project when 8 years in people jump on and downvote guys when they suggest that at a bitcoin conference, things should be openly priced in btc first.

No not at all, what I'm suggesting is that maybe quite a few of those accounts are not active and contain 0 bitcoin.
How many users does MySpace have ? If you count users just by the number of accounts people have set up it doesn't give a very realistic view of the number of people who actively are using the service in my opinion.
@_date: 2016-12-26 21:07:11
Is get a job and buy them number 1 on that list ? 
Giving the impression that bitcoin can be sourced from anything other than buying them leads people down the wrong path.

Think usery was a Christian thing,  look, was not meant to he taken too seriously. But fuck I think your average Muslim has no problem using a normal banking system that involved some aspect of "interest".

New users, don't be put off, you would have to be pretty unlucky to lose your coin, more chance of fraud on your debit/credit card or bank account.
Just be sensible, write down the seed when prompted to by your wallet when you download it and keep it somewhere safe. 
Learn as you go, buy a little, send a little, if you like it and think btc is the future then buy some more but hopefully by then you will understand bitcoin security more and understand your options :-)

Sure it could well go through a stage where we get a lot of images posted but like I mentioned previously, I think it would be self regulating as if the post was rubbish and the image shit it would create no bitcoin and so be a waste of time posting.

Yup, it's very worrying. Saw a post on Facebook very recently in a group about the town I live in. This guy just randomly posted about how he had made "free money" from bitcoin. Interested I looked at his profile and the genius had all his posts viable, there were so many about crypto, talking about how much he had made that day ( not huge amounts, I'm guessing he has about a quarter of a coin) but the most worrying thing was how he was acting like he was a freaking expert using all the usual buzzwords. From the rest of his comments and profile it was kinda obvious that he just a regular guy doing a manual job. His most recent comments regarded him trading his BTC for some sketchy ICO I've never heard of because " that's where you make the really big profits" :-(
Not fud but it does worry me that crypto as a whole is in a huge bubble right now and it's going to pop real soon.

Do you bug wooden bowls online now ? Why not ? Plenty of poor people online already.

Changetip used to be good for this kind of thing but it's shutdown now. I liked them but some people didn't. If you plan to work on something similar then your first stumbling block is the trust issue. If you want offchain instant transactions then users are trusting you with their bitcoin. Personally i don't mind trusting a tipping service with a few dollars worth if they seem reputable but others may not like it. Good luck if you going to give it a try though, always good to see people working on bitcoin applications.

Smart people take advice and store their wealth (fiat or crypto, or gold or whatever) safely. If OP wants to give his money to a dodgy website that allows illigal activity ( gambling in his country) then he has to consider there a high chance he may lose his money.
Absolutely no sympathy for him, makes no difference that it bitcoin, could just as well been fiat he transferred to a suspicious gambling website, the result would have been the same. Fools and their money are easily parted, OP a perfect example.

You would make a shit mod if you think me pointing out the risk he taken sending his coins to a site that tumbles coins. Sure maybe I'm not a bitcoin expert but i can see no valid reason for a average bitcoin user to send his coin to a site that mixes his coins with other coins that may have a dubious past. If doing this is necessary for average bitcoin users then bitcoin is not going to speak to the masses.

They do indeed, i know what you mean about the prices though, i wanted to get my boy a new controller for his ps4 a month or so ago and the prices were mad ! Ended up getting him a brand new one from a local shop for less than cex were charging for a second hand one. 
My boy gets a lot of games from them though, especially older games which he gets quite cheap. Saying that though he seems to have got a hodl thing going and wants to keep the bitcoin especially as he was already up 6p yesterday and looking at the price today he should be up even more !

@_date: 2016-02-15 16:36:24
Sorry in advance if this is a stupid question.
I remember being advised not to use "online wallets" as they held the keys and so were less secure.
I have mycelium on my phone ( don't have enough to worry about cold storage or investing in trezors and stuff ) but I was thinking...
A while ago I had to reinstall mycelium after a problem with my phone. I put in the word code thing and boom I had my bits back.
So with mycelium do I have the key? Or do they have it on a server somewhere? 
Is the word code a encrypted version of my key ?? Or just a extremely hard to break password ?? 
Answers in a ELI5 format please !
Edit, in short thought mycelium was a good choice but not sure now. If they got hacked, could everyone lose their coin??

The people who theses phones will be useful to are the low paid , low skilled workers, they are not craftsmen or tech savvy people who bitcoin will be attractive too. I would suggest they would be more concerned about buying everyday basics then gambling on a internet money they don't understand.

Bullshit. And if it isn't then your a fucking moron leaving 51 btc on a risky online casino. Fools and their money.

My first thought as someone who believes in playing safe is that taking a loan out to buy bitcoin is really fucking stupid BUT, no-one one call your plan silly if you took out a loan to start a business or basically gamble on something else. If you confident that bitcoin going up then fuck it, do it. Just remember it is risky and you going to have to take steps to hide what you doing from the lender or they could call in the loan.

Seen what ? India's poor who suddenly have access to the Internet via a $4 phone starting up e-commerce sites via the $4 phone ?? Is that what you have seen ??
Or have you seen the more affluent and better educated buy other phones and Internet connected devices and use those to sell via online outlets ?? The people who may sell stuff online ALREADY have connected devices, $4 phones targeted at the poor will have zero effect on bitcoin. It's great for those that these phones will enable online resources for but I doubt buying bitcoin will be high on their list of to do now they have internet.

It doesn't have to be offchain, i believe the new tipbot is onchain and that's why you need to add a extra 100bits to cover the tx fee, it's quite a good workaround but i could see it suffering slow and stuck transactions. Offchain works very well, very fast with no tx fees but at the cost of being centralised and users having to trust the service not to lose or run off with the coin as any coin in your tipbot balance is ultimately under their control.
 Edit,worth remembering is to move coins from the tipbot to a "real"wallet the tipbot owner will have to pay the tx fee as this will be onchain

Dude if you got spare cash then lucky you but don't believe everyone in the same boat. 
Say i got lucky and got a load of overtime and had a extra $250 at the end of this month. What would be the wisest move ? A) put it in the bank and save it for when the car needs new tires or other emergency or b) buy some bitcoin in the hope the price rises in which case i shouldn't sell anyway because hodl !!
Look, right now i really don't have the spare cash to be buying bitcoin, it really is not a big deal, if the situation changes then yeah maybe i will but it not a priority.

Can i suggest you go round and cut your neighbours lawn so you can get a extra $20 worth if building your stash of bitcoin is so important to you. Personally i like to spend my free time with my family. There more to life than buying bitcoin my friend.
Didn't realise my comment would get such a response, it kind of the way this sub has gone, the reality of the majority is completely out of the comprehension of the wealthy who populate this sub nowadays. Let me spell it out to you, most people do not have so much money that they can afford to buy bitcoin. If i did mow next doors lawn and he gave me $20 do you think I'd buy bitcoin with it ? Fuck no, I'd buy a new toilet roll holder to replace the broken one in the bathroom with the dirty fiat $20. That is the reality of i think most people's lives.

Your best option is to just work a regular job and convert some of your wage to bitcoin.

Personally I don't give a shit if they a scam or not, it your coin, if you happy giving it to a random website to look after for you then fine but just don't come crying if it turns out bad for you and you lose your coin.

How much more ? If it a lot (more than your agreed overdraft) then the trade will probably be cancelled but your bank will probably charge you fees for the refused transaction. If it under your agreed overdraft then it kinda depends on the terms of your account, some will charge you a small daily fee for being overdrawn and some will not. Go to your bank and find out.

We really need a stickied post at the top of the page which says " YOU CANNOT MINE BITCOIN WITH A HOME COMPUTER ANYMORE" 
I understand why new guys want to mine ( I wanted to too when I first looked into bitcoin, back then it was still profitable with a decent graphics card, unfortunately I didn't have a decent graphics card lol!) But I think nowadays we need to try and make it clear right from the start that unless you have lots of free electricity and a few thousand spare $ to invest in dedicated mining equipment (which will be outdated before you know it) then mining is just not possible anymore.

The recent flood of ICO's has been a huge threat to crypto, they are designed to sucker in the greedy and niave. I've seen adverts for them all over Twitter, Facebook and here on Reddit too. 100% premined shit coins promising all sorts of wonderful advances (and more importantly, riches to whoever invests).

Thats good although the charity taking the donation would still need the person donating to give their name and address and to tick a box confirming they a UK tax payer.

I think bitcoin been around long enough and has had enough mainstream media coverage that yes, most people should be aware of what bitcoin is by now. But look let's be honest, some people are more interested in some shite reality TV show than they are in what's going on in the world around them. For too many people having the latest iPhone is a higher priority than being in debt.

No it isn't, it's human nature. People gravitate to people who they can associate their own lives too, doesn't apply just to a disability, if you say were a orphan and met another orphan you would have empathy with that person and tend to be more trusting of them even if they were a complete stranger. If you can relate to someone through a shared life experience whatever it is you will subconsciously be more open to suggestions from them.

No. If the phone dies you can use the seed to restore the wallet. If you lose the phone and you don't have a pin code to unlock it then you could lose the coin as whoever finds it will have access to the wallet.

You have a android phone ? Get mycelium from Google play store and stick that on your phone, takes like 2 minutes. Write down the 12 word seed it gives you and keep it somewhere safe. Then withdraw your coin to the address mycelium gives you when you click receive.

Here in the UK pretty much every charity now gets a extra 25% on top of the donation you make using "gift aid"
So for example I recently sponsored a friend who was doing a bike ride in support of a cancer charity. I clicked the link he provided which took me to the charity webpage, gave them £10 via debit card and ticked the check box saying I was a UK tax payer which then allowed the charity to claim a extra £2.50 from the government.
I don't think the UK government would be willing to give a extra 25% in btc lol!!
I believe businesses often donate to charity and then use it as a tax break too and I not sure they could do this on btc.
For individual people across borders then yes btc is a great option for charitable giving but while , here in the UK If i can get the government to cough up a bit of extra cash for the charity , fiat is the way to go.

Here's the real reason, and I know this for a fact. My mate crazy Keith has a friend who's uncle works for a supplier to Tesla. Now a couple weeks ago he was doing a delivery  to the Tesla factory and Elon himself was there and he was talking with some Chinese gangster types, now luckily crazy Keith's friends uncle had a online girlfriend from Hong Kong so he can understand the Chinese lingo. Turns out Tesla has been running a secret underground mining facility and the Chinese were not happy about it. Elon said it was him who invented bitcoin and that he was satoshi and he would prove it by crashing the market before buying back in and making 50 million dollars.

Seems the guy who had his bank account "hacked" just found a even more profitable way to use LBC than you.
Sorry to sound harsh but you chased the easy money and it bit you in the ass.

I'm not bothered if the government can see where I'm spending, I'm sure they have access to that information now via my bank and visa. The alternative is bitcoin being the choice currency of organised crime.

Dude, in the light of the number if morons sinking money into bullshit like onecoin, I'm setting up a new coin, it's going to be called Number2Coin and I'm estimating a market cap of 60 billion USD. If you want to buy in at the ground floor I can offer you 10% of all premier coins at a one off, today only price of 60k USD, that's 60k for 6billion worth of coin and that's assuming the price stays level, it probably will be double that !!

It's your lucky day my friend, I'm working on a new coin, will be releasing soon. Number2Coin will be the world leader in super fast payment methods with zero fees. At release it will have a 60 billion USD market cap.
Billl Gates and Richard Bransons are already on board with each holding 10% in pre-release tokens. 
Act now to get in at the ground floor, this a opertunity of a lifetime.
Early investers can expect to see returns of 600000% , did you miss the early days of bit coin when each bitcoin was just a few cents ? They now worth thousands each !! Be smart , be a Number2.
Early investers can also benefit from the POO referral scheme (personal opertunity offer). When a new invested signs up with you under a POO referral the invested will receive a xtra 10% in coin and you will receive 5% in coins.
Don't delay, invest today.

Firstly you need to check you have the correct type of bitcoin for sending. You will then need to check that you both are ready and are connected to a strong WiFi signal ( never use 4g as 4g is know to be used by hacker group 4 Chan to steal in transit coins) . When you are both ready then the sender needs to set the miners fee, first class if you want quick next day delivery or second class if you can wait a couple days. Then once fee is selected enter your friends wallet address and press send. Simple

This shit can't fail, I estimate a market cap of 60 billion USD.

The invoice I pasted came from the cassino. It also had another string under it which was their node address?? Didn't copy that though. Have had a look at the page and can't see any options to check deposits.

Just had another go, profile worked fine this time but I did notice on the bar with faucet , deposit , withdraw . The faucet is out of line and has dropped down lower than the deposit , withdraw icons. Have taken a screenshot if you need to see it, just let me know. Using android.

I would play it safe and buy a tank, and a attack helicopter if you got a lot of bitcoins. Definitely some personal security guards. Maybe fortify your house now in preparation.

I fully expect it to break the 3k mark someday but when ? Who knows, may be soon, may be it will drop like a brick first but yes, it will get there and higher.

I use this exclusive and members only club. 
It works on a simple principal, you send it 0.1 btc to a address they give you (no website  a or anything, it's too 
underground for that) and wait to see what happens, you may double your coin or triple it even or you may get nothing back.
It's not for small timers and you need some big balls to play but if you want I can get a invite for you ;-)

I think the best advice for Turkish people right now is keep your head down, stay indoors, and listen to the radio for news.

We will need new laws and I propose that all attractive women are, by law, required to be naked while those that are not deemed attractive should be sent back to Germany.
