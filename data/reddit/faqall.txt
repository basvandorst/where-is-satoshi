Im noticing there are hardly any tasks today... When will there be more. Ive been doing this every day since posted for a few hours here and there. Made about 4.5 BTC.
@_date: 2012-02-24 16:42:22
I have given it a shot. So far paid 0.06934244BTC since 27 minutes ago. I provided my mtgox walled ID so I'm waiting to see the funds there before I continue on. Any sort of ETA on when I should expect to see an increase in balance on my mtgox account?

This is great news however disappointing for me as they only support Bank of America, Wells Fargo, Citibank and Chase. None of these are near me!

After trying a few different tasks I'm noticing that most of the "Find Images Online for Specific Places" just show () for the image. I'm using firefox 10. Anyone else experiencing this?

This is sad. I attempted to send funds over to MtGox and confirmed this does in fact come up! Having an account with Dwolla for some time now I only needed to turn on my hub page and verify/link a social account. No problem turning on the hub page. But the social network.. I refuse to provide them this. Completely ridiculous and seems a bit greedy of them! They can however have access to my newly created 'dummy account'.. suckers. 
If there is another service out there that will allow me to link my bank account in such a fashion as paypal/dwolla and transfer funds to get BTC without such BS rules I'd love to know. Most cash deposit services don't have any supported banks around me.

Very generous! 
@_date: 2012-05-16 15:16:39
Yes. I had zero problems. I have not added a FB account. I have not verified my SSN. I have had my account for a few months with them (Dwolla and MtGox) and have not had a single problem sending them money (from Dwolla to MtGox). I have no idea how I am still able to transact.. 
Most recent transaction was today.

Thanks. It looks like I've got some reading to do. 
@_date: 2013-02-25 18:18:06
I too would like an answer to this. I assume when I see the pay to "BTC Address" option again I'll be good to go!?

According to the [BI support]( page you can do it directly from the website as well!
I am still waiting for my 'membership confirmation email' from Zipmark. It seems at this point in time you can only purchase a 'Bronze Membership' for $1.99 via google checkout. Only thing is it limits you to $250/day. There are other options that allow for higher daily transfers which I imagine you have to pay more for but I can't seem to choose them yet. Perhaps after I am confirmed/Verified. Standing by.
From the BI site regarding your original question:

I never got an email from bitinstant (second time this happened) so I dont have a conf number and didn't save it from the page like I should have. Either way they can track it with my $ amount and BTC address like they have in the past. I dont even see that they made an attempt to send it either because its not even in the block chain. Sorry you too are having this issue. Stinks! $500 floating around in never never land! *finger crossed*
@_date: 2013-02-25 18:17:01
I had the same problem trying to figure out why the pay to "BTC Address" option was no longer there. Came here to find my answer. 
@_date: 2013-03-08 13:18:26
Same exact thing happened to me! I'm out $150 right now!
@_date: 2013-04-24 15:32:42
I too am having this issue. BitInstant to BTC Address funds still not transferred in over 24 hours. Highly unusual! No response from support. I initiated the transfer yesterday at 10:16 AM ET and ZIPZAP confirmed funds were received. No response to support requests in over 24hours as well. Hope I'm not down $500!  
Amount to Pay: $503.95
Account Number: 624849675
Your ZipZap payment has been successfully processed and the merchant

I do not have a conf number from bitinstant because an email was never set to me like it used to in the past!
I also posted here at the 330 page long "support thread" looks kind of clustered to me): 
EDIT: Received a response from BI saying the issue is on Coinapult's side.

I was looking around the bitinstant site and I'm not sure if I'm completely overlooking something or if the feature for Zipmark was removed. Can someone perhaps send me a direct like or guide me on how to give this a shot. Sounds like a much better way to acquire BTC. 
Since BitInstant has been having so many problems I have resorted to buying MoneyPaks and using vendors on the Road to acquire BTC however the fees are quite high and there is also an added risk of never receiving coins (however I have done about 5 successful trans this way). 
Thanks in advanced!

I tried sending money directly to a BTC Address when the site came back up via Moneygram... the order says "Order execution failed!" even though I have confirmation from both moneygram and zipzap that my funds were transferred. I contacted support and it has been two days now with no response or update as to where my coins are. I've had great experiences in the past but this is just getting frustrating! Can you assist me!?
@_date: 2013-06-29 17:39:40
So it would normally be in the drop down menu for the funding source upon creating a new transaction?
I have just created a Zipmark account via my iPhone. If this feature returns that would be a godsend for people trying to acquire BTC. It seems to be getting harder and harder to do so now without being charged HUGE % fees... especially if you are trying to acquire $1000+ in BTC. My fingers are crossed.
if you happen to read this can you shed some light as to what is going on with the Zipmark option? Thanks in advanced!

This is the response I got regarding Zipmark:








@_date: 2013-06-29 18:29:43
FYI: The Zipmark option is currently unavailable. I have emailed support asking when it will return. Not really expecting a timely response from support based off previous experiences.. but the question is out there. I will keep checking the BI site periodically to see if the option becomes available. I will also report back with any response to my submitted support request. If you guys hear/see anything sooner than I please do share! It would be greatly appreciated! 
@_date: 2013-04-24 18:13:39
This happened once before and took DAYs to get money back. I'm not really happy about this right now. I don't necessarily have $500 to just throw away :(! A warning that they were having issues would have been nice. The option should be taken offline if they are having so many issues! Per the forums and even here at reddit I am not the only one! 
P.S. The response I got was on the forums.. that 330 page long support thread. Asked another question there but seems to be getting dodged? Not sure what to think honestly. I have faith in them and hope things stabilize. If I don't see my funds I will stick strictly to Dwolla &gt; MtGox &gt; Wallet. PERIOD. Works every time just takes 3 business days!
