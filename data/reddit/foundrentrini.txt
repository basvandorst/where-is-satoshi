That's what I think too.

Not true (apparently) for the BitFi.

Oh geez, Rick. Better read that article again.

Of course you can tell when you see Doom on there, but can you tell when someone manipulated the device and put a firmware on it that looks and behaves the same way as the original but actually sends your funds to a different address?
You can't steal a BitFi and remove coins from it, because it probably doesn't story any private key information on there. That's where this "unhackable" claim comes from. But a huge attack vector is a supply-chain attack or an evil-maid attack, where you manipulate the device and have the victim use it to enter sensitive data. Unless I misunderstood the results, it looks like that's very easily possible with the BitFi but very hard to do with a Ledger.

Yes you can trace the coins. Bitcoin isn't annoymous, but pseudonymous. The blockchain shows to what addresses the coins go to. What you don't necessarily know however, is who controls those receiving addresses. If at some point you receive a payment and can link an address to a certain person, e.g. someone buys something in person in a store and pays with bitcoin, then you can try to trace the money back and maybe find out where it came from. It's an interesting problem because you might end up with 'tainted' bitcoins that come from suspiscious activites and 'clean' bitcoins. Google around for pseudonymity and fungibility if you want to know more.

Yes, stealing cryptocurrencies is certainly interesting for hackers, because you can steal them directly from less sophisticated targets like private users. The typical user isn't as security\-aware as a bank and relatively speaking an easy target. 
But keeping private keys secure isn't actually as difficult as it sounds, to be honest. Smart\-cards are specifically designed for this problem. They store a secret (like a bitcoin private key) which can never be extracted out of the card. A hardware wallet is basically the same thing. It's a device that stores the private keys for your cryptocurrencies. The key never gets released and the device can't be copied. Even when you perform a transaction the private key doesn't get revelead. The device signs your transaction when you enter the correct PIN. So you would have to steal the hardware wallet and get the PIN within a couple of tries in order to steal the coins.

Bitcoin itself is secure and hasn't been hacked. What's happening is, that users and exchanges get hacked and lose their private keys to access the bitcoins / the coins get transferred away to another address. 
Here's an analogy: Bitcoin is similar to cash. People lose their wallets or get robbed all the time. That has no impact on cash itself.

Exactly. a) If you don't believe in bitcoin, why invest? b) If you believe in bitcoin, don't you think it'll go to $100k eventually?

Is this a copypasta?
@_date: 2018-06-11 08:53:08
No, there isn't. It's an interesting problem tho, because that means you end up with 'tainted' and 'clean' coins and not all of the coins are interchangeable / equal. Google for fungibility if you want to know more.

Cryptocurrencies *have* to work in a completely hostile environment. It shouldn't come as a surprise, that there are attacks on it. It's an open network and everyone can try to mess with the system. The bigger the value of the whole network, the more incentive there will be to manipulate it. This is the nature of this trustless and open system. The amazing and revolutionary part about bitcoin is exactly the fact, that multiple parties who don't trust each other can come to a consensus in such a system.
