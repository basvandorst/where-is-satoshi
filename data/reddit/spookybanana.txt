What is an alternative solution that works on the scale of a country?
@_date: 2014-03-05 15:40:57
Nah, we have that in America too. People just don't want to admit that it is easier and safer to pay with cards.
@_date: 2014-04-29 20:16:54
Where were you paying for having a checkbook? Checks have always been free for me but I'm at a CU. I prefer checks so I always have proof they received payment.

And now any future articles posted about this guy will have the whole Bitcoin community giving the site page views and giving them reasons to publish more and more.
@_date: 2014-02-25 03:23:54
Then people put more in after the problems. Never underestimate greed.

If everyone could choose whether or not to be in the public eye that would be the end of investigative journalism.

Yeah, I meant safe as in certain protections in place to prevent fraud. If you are paying with a credit card you aren't liable for fraudulent spending, etc... There is certainly the risk of personal info leaking and identity theft which is a nightmare to sort through.

The block reward for DOGE will be halving in 10 days. The same mining hardware will only receive half the amount it was today.

Investors weren't going to invest in BTC 3 months into its life either. Rich people will follow the money and invest.

This is why I don't understand how some bitcoiners seem so happy and eager to jump in bed with Wall Street.

Seriously though, who uses MongoDB for transactional data?
@_date: 2014-02-08 18:36:52
Definitely. Unfortunately the burden of security is put entirely on the user for cryptos. This is going to be one of the major hurdles for mainstream adoption unless some service comes along that can offer some sort of insurance.
@_date: 2014-02-01 02:26:59
lol at all the people who are missing your point again and again. Bitcoin needs a community to succeed. If a large majority of that community stops participating for fear of law, the community will die.

I'm saying that if he is so private and someone just outed him, he has no reason to provide concrete proof if he wants to stay private. It would be the opposite, he would want to prove he isn't Satoshi.

Two separate cases. The hitman charges are a separate case that is still pending in Maryland.

They don't comply with any rules which is why they are staying anonymous.

Satoshi ate all the meat in his lunch.

Are we really self regulating? What are the consequences for exchanges that do not meet our standards? Leave them? MtGox has been known to be incompetent for over 2 years and had been shady as fuck leading up to the meltdown yet tons of people still stayed with them.

Isn't it easier now to not get jailed or shot (in the US) due to the IRS stance on how to tax BTC? At least now anyone who is breaking tax code is doing it willingly and there is a legal alternative if you choose to follow it?
@_date: 2014-02-24 04:09:46
Better get use to it.
@_date: 2014-05-02 21:22:05
Phrasing? Wouldn't you ask how much is in your wallet? I don't answer $20 if someone asks how big my cash wallet is. 
@_date: 2014-04-20 06:23:15
Thank you for writing this. This is an actual domain where Bitcoin can be disruptive. This is the type of thing people should be focusing on, not ways to buy fucking coffee or consumer goods with Bitcoin. 
@_date: 2014-03-05 19:32:49
And I'm assuming you are somewhat tech savvy. Now think of potential mainstream users who might eventually get into crypto. Accidents will happen and I'm sure a lot of people do not want to spend the rest of their lives worrying if their life savings is safe on that USB stick or piece of paper in the house. You are correct, there will need to be a type of service for this in the future. Operating as your own bank is a double-edged sword. 
@_date: 2014-03-06 16:15:31
That works if you want to prove you are Satoshi. How do you prove you aren't Satoshi?

Just some advice, drop any political aspects. Like religion, no one wants someone else's politics shoved down their throat. It makes you come off as trying to recruit them for some "greater good". Bitcoin (and crypto in general) have plenty of merits to stand on besides possible political ramifications.
Emphasize how easy (relative to traditional means) it is to instantly transfer money person-to-person. It it amazing how quickly I can send money to a friend across the world without jumping through hoops.
They will think the technology is pretty cool but nothing more than a toy until you show them how they can actually use it. There are plenty of resources online that list places you can actually spend your Bitcoin. If you live near or in somewhat of a larger city then there are probably physical locations you can spend at which is really cool the first time.
If they are tech savvy at all, introduce them to the actual technology behind it. It is really fascinating how the protocol and cryptography all work together to make this happen.
Finally, really get after them for security. Tell them to setup 2FA on their email account and any exchange/wallet they use online.

The best time to buy bitcoins was 4 years ago, the second best time is now.
@_date: 2014-04-28 02:33:51
You never have bitcoin, just access to them via private keys. In the case of two identical wallets, whomever decrypts it first can do whatever they want. 
@_date: 2014-02-08 01:51:55
Wait until everyday people start getting into BTC. It's going to be a bloodbath.
@_date: 2014-01-27 22:44:34
I usually avoid any thread about taxes because it quickly turns to a shit show. Glad I looked this time, thanks for the site!

I feel for the people who lost coin in Gox. But at the same time, no one at the casino reimburses me when I lose everything.

I bought my first couple BTC when it was ~ $1150. FML :)
