It is bullshit if you aren't money laundering.
@_date: 2013-06-22 00:07:58
It is not illegal to deposit 10k cash but there is the possibly that you could be accused of selling drugs, money laundering or other such activity. If that is the case, the money can be seized under civil asset forfeiture laws.
Innocent until proven guilty does not apply to assets.
I don't even bother putting cash into the bank, just spend it instead. Not worth the risk, at all.

It is the whole anti-money laundering bullshit. Banks don't want to get sucked into some government bullshit that's why they close the accounts. That's the risk you take if you use banks to buy/sell bitcoins.
Been saying it for months now, the only safe way to buy/sell bitcoins is in person, face to face with cash. (using common sense of course).
and that's honestly what more people should be doing. Every city should have a local meetup group where we can discuss bitcoin related stuff (and then buy/sell bitcoins on the side).

Hmm, strange, I've used traditional forums for years and years now and they seem to work perfect.

It is okay to do just remember you are making a speculative investment (ie. You only make money if BTC exchange rate increases in favor of BTC). Make sure your risks are justified.
Don't put all your eggs in one basket, diversify. Don't invest anything you can't afford to lose.
Bitcoin might increase in value or it might not, that's the bottom line with any speculative investment. I would only recommend investing in bitcoin if the potential for profit is there. I believe that bitcoin can grow in value over the long term so the potential rewards justify the risks. 
Just make sure to stay focus on the investing part and not get sweeped up into the emotions of it (ie. getting rich or losing it all type of mentality). If something better comes along, are you going to be able to dump your btc holdings and perhaps move to the next thing?

Basically, it is all a giant mathematical equation. The asic companies know they can make more money, faster by selling the equipment since there are other asic companies shipping product as well. 
The value of each asic will decrease as more miners start mining. We haven't seen it yet but eventually there is going to be a time period where the hash rate starts to shoot through the roof at a huge rate.
When that happens, everyone who rushed in to buy an asic will be left holding the bag to say the least. The asic companies will be the ones who win in the end. 
Right now, it is only worth it to run an asic because they are hard to get and hence the hash rate is still low. 
The wildcard is in the price of bitcoin, for the increasing hash rate to be sustainable it will require that bitcoin price continues to increase.

That might work in the short term but over the long term the difficulty increases will kill it.

This is what happens:
1) buyer bids up the price of the item. Most of the time it is digital items like electronic gift cards or other such items.
2) Buyer pays via paypal and waits a few weeks time.
3) Seller then sends the items via email.
4) Buyer opens a dispute claiming they never received the item in the mail.
5) Since the seller cannot provide any, "proof" that the buyer received the item the seller is left holding the bag and Ebay will 99% of the time return payment to the buyer.
That's what is going on.

How much easier do you need it to be? It seems pretty easy for me even when I was new to it.
@_date: 2013-06-21 02:59:15
What we need is a reliable TOR based securities market. Then we have trusted members create gold/silver ETF type securities similar to what you see on btct.co. All securities can be bought and sold for bitcoin ONLY. That way you can move from gold, silver or bitcoins extremely easily.
Of course the trust factor is a big part of it but assuming you have a trust worthy etf then that securities market will be so much better than regular stock markets!

I agree that is a good read for sure

I looked into it, it is extremely difficult.
Who the hell wants to accept argentine pesos if you have bitcoins?
and you can't exactly set up an exchange either, the account will most likely get seized. Argentina central bank doesn't want competition! and they are willing to fight to protect their turf.
@_date: 2013-06-18 00:40:49
Yup, for sure.
@_date: 2013-06-17 02:01:26
Three years but anyone who is a professional scammer would have laundered the money by then.
And these days with bitcoin, you can hide the money away FOREVER. So even if you get arrested and thrown in jail, they won't be able to seize your bitcoins, lol!
I'm surprised more scammers aren't using bitcoins.
Also from what I've read, half the time these bank fraudsters get off lightly, a few years time even though they stole in the hundreds of thousands.

I'm curious, what happens if you used a dummy paypal account, sold the overpriced bitcoins and then pulled all the money out ASAP? What would happen when they reverse the payments? 
@_date: 2013-06-17 01:57:40
Interesting but with people willing to do credit card fraud. I'm sure this would be another great idea for them. I would just laugh my ass off if these reverse payment scammers got burned big time.
Pull the scam on the scammers, move as much money as fast as possible into bitcoin and then wait to get arrested. When you get arrested all the money will be gone and paypal won't get shit. lol. Same thing happens with credit card fraudsters, half the time all the money is gone by the time the banks get around to finding and prosecuting the people. They work in groups. Same story could be applied to the paypal reverse payment scammers since they are willing to drop 2-3x the value of the item.

Yup, pretty much!
@_date: 2013-06-19 06:55:24
Sure looks like it. The whole idea of, "pre-ordering" a product with bitcoin is completely idiotic. Too much potential for scams. If a company wants to, "test the market" they should do reservations instead. Let people reserve the order instead, that way there is no risk to the buyer. If the product is in limited supply then the existing inventory should just be auctioned off when the product is ready for delivery.
Pre-ordering would only work if there was a very trustworthy 3rd party escrow service that was holding the bitcoins instead.

Well said.
I think the bigger issue to government spying is that it is a huge threat to liberty. If you know the government is watching you, are you really going to be vocal about government abuses, crimes, and speaking out against the government? Probably not. 
It is absurd that our constitution has been violated so much and no one has been prosecuted. I would consider these violations to be high treason and those responsible should be held to the fullest extent of the law. If any government officials are responsible they should be subject to penalty of death if found guilty by jury trial.
@_date: 2013-06-17 01:46:17
That's your half a million dollar mistake.
@_date: 2013-06-17 05:12:59
Yup it does but people will do it for smaller amounts. If you are serious about actually getting back at these scammers you would sell a shitload of stuff on ebay and then clear the money out of the accounts ASAP. 
@_date: 2013-06-19 20:27:41
Yup and by then you will have already rode off into the sunset.

That thread post is from the guy who created a program called open transactions. It is a program that allows for, "anonymous" transactions, designed as an exchange. So you can use it to exchange usd for bitcoin and the such. [read here](
Bitmessage is another entirely separate program. It is basically exactly like bitcoin except it is used like email. It is decentralized and there is a, "block chain." The block chain consists of encrypted messages. If you have an address and another user's address then you can send them an encrypted message and not have to worry about it getting snooped in on.  [read here](
When you combine the bitmessage with open transactions is where you get something that is very revolutionary. You'll be able to send money to another person and the banks will have no idea what exactly you are sending the money for. All they'll know is that you sent them x amount of dollars. For all they know you could have bought a car or something. It is also important to mention that ALL traditional email services (yahoo, gmail etc.) have a backdoor built into them which allows the NSA/FBI/CIA etc to read your emails without a warrant. Bitmessage prevents that from happening, as far as i know.
I haven't done the full research on open transactions or bit message, so read the links I posted.

The idea behind the scheme is to pull the money out of the paypal account before the payment gets reversed lol. That would end up screwing either paypal or the reverse payment scammer.

Mining is always about who has the most efficient hardware, that is who can get the most hashes for the amount of money spent on energy. Whoever has that setup will win, in the long-run. 
@_date: 2013-06-20 23:38:11
It is going to increase at an even faster rate.
@_date: 2013-06-20 23:36:46


If bitcoin goes bit then many people will be using it and it will easy to find local people to buy/sell. The average joe isn't going to have 10s of thousands going in and out of bitcoin.


That applies to cash only and the amount has to be a few thousand, not sure on the exact figure. Bitcoins can't be seized from you unless you give up the key.
At this point, I'm sure the government isn't interested in seizing some fake virtual, "money."
@_date: 2013-06-19 20:28:07
Hmm yeah, I wonder why....lol.
@_date: 2013-06-17 06:20:07


Yup, it is a constant arms race to say the least. Then you have idiots who didn't do the math and just run their hardware at a loss. Get in enough of those people and there won't even be much profit to be made at all.


Agree. If anything it is a very specialized industry. Only those who have thoroughly planned it out will make money.
@_date: 2013-06-17 01:27:52
It is just a bunch of scammers all fighting over who gets to scam the guy.
100% guaranteed reverse payment fraud. Pretty common for certain items on ebay.
