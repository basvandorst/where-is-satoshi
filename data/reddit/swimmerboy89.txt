This is seriously fucked up shit. Big players aren't getting one source of information to sell or buy. Which means this is literally targeting small btc holders to scare them. This person should be ashamed of themself. This is in no way funny at all.

Not directly. They could charge you an additional fee to go to gdax.com and then they could slow the connection to certain people while increasing it to paying customers to give them an advantage...

Washington is one of those states. But coinbase is okay. Something to do with a law we passed I believe.

Trash article with a ton of bias. Comparing all miners in the world to unrelated things. Each transaction powers a refrigerator for a year... Right....

Extremely helpful this clarified it all up. Very much appreciated friend.

We've had a 53% increase in the last month. How can you not believe we could be at 10k in another month. I'm no math expert but it seems possible seeing as its growing at a fairly consistant rate. (Volatile growth but still growth at the end of every day)

Corrected its self before you could even type this lol

You got in at a confusing and uncertain time. Everyone expected a split from the blockchain that was called off yesterday. It has everyone ruffled up a little so the market is trying to find its comfort level before attempting to rise consistently again.
Or fall lower, this is always an option. Though with no fork the bitcoin core community is rather pleased.
@_date: 2017-11-02 12:47:42
We Washingtonians don't have that luxury alright ;)
@_date: 2017-11-09 23:43:14
This is pretty damn cool. Good for you. Since it'll never get you note than say a thousand bucks in 5 years or so. If it were me, I'd withdrawl it and buy $80 worth of alt coin thatcould pay off much bigger.

Stepped in and vowed to fix Australia's failing power grid in 100 days.
Sent over tesla power stations to get Puerto Ricos power back up.
Has been tremendously helpful in helping the Muslim communities devastated by conflict relocate to better situations.
Less specifically his hyperloop could change travel for countries where there is a divide between rural and suburban communities.
His space work has basically re-lit the interest people have in space exploration all by himself.
From a heterosexual man. I'm totally on this guys nuts.

Literally this. He can't do everything himself. Busy single handedly saving whole countries and colonizing the moon.
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:01:32
This. Many people believe it didn't fall low enough to correct it's steep growth this last month
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:50:36
What specific fear caused specific regulation? They simply said you have to charge everyone equally for the same service. How is that too regulated?
@_date: 2017-11-11 01:57:44
Too be fair. A human brain is far stronger than any network of computers and we've had thousands of those for decades working on that very thing....

Exactly this. Be a leader. 
An example. 
Be Elon Musk.
But at the very least show a little humility.

I watched an interview he did with some Asian chick and he was extremely "untethered". He would snap at the reporter for translation misinterpretations. He would get really worked up explaining bitcoin and insult everyone asking questions telling them they clearly did not understand satoshis dream or some shit.
Kid is a glorified bomb supplier. 100% would suspect this kid would be most likely to snap.

Absolutely but it is a $75+ investment and a month long back order. Read up on the b2x (segwit2x) fork and decide where you would like to hold out
@_date: 2017-11-01 21:10:34
I kinda feel that was OPs intent. To argue that bitcoin doesn't have much higher to go. There are a lot of people still believing it could be 100k+ per bitcoin 10 years down the line. 
@_date: 2017-11-09 21:00:56
Absolutely. The length of time Trump had been in office is irrelevant in this case. While a normal politician would have eased into things. We have been seeing total shifts in policies in all sectors of the government in only a years time. Most noticeably would be the new extreme immigration reform being done.
But seeing as the DOJ and sessions (just last week) are using the silk road as an excuse to start looking into cyptocurrentcys (at least to the media) it seems like a false flag.  This activity only accounts for a fraction of the money being traded. 
This entire crackdown is because the Republicans on the hill don't believe that the average working American will be honest and claim taxable income that they recieve from capital gains. Which may be true. 
Which is why the paradise papers play a role. Crypto taxes are nothing in comparison to the wealth being hidden from taxable laws as it stands. 
So yes, I do believe this is "this administrations" misguided actions.
@_date: 2017-11-13 03:30:48
I agree with what he says but he really shouldn't curse so much. Makes a moot point in my opinion.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:05:33
Have many withdrawn? I'm a bit worried with the claim 80% of the hashing community agreeing to switch...
@_date: 2017-11-05 03:42:20
Still a new market for a lot of people :P
@_date: 2017-11-08 19:06:46
This community should pretty much not touch anything they do further
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:33:16
Shouldn't keep it on gdax Or coinbase is what most people here will tell you. Only way to be 100% secure is cold storage. That way you own the private keys.

Why are all these promotions young accounts with no history....

A person selling bomb making supplies online is not a good person.
And you know it.
Or did you think that he was selling this shit to legit business with well respected and regulated practices?
It is very plausible to claim he directly played a role in someone's death as a result of his sales.
Shame on you for trying to defend his actions.
@_date: 2017-11-12 20:51:55
That behavior qualifies him as such.
@_date: 2017-11-05 23:12:52
A bit aggressive with the response though.
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:26:58
No god.
@_date: 2017-11-12 17:44:35
Watch him interview. That's a completely rational guy to you?
@_date: 2017-11-05 04:16:30
You are the best. Thank you for that. 
Why do I still feel nervous about it?
Feel like all my life I've been told if it's too good too be true... Free money is still hard to comprehend.
@_date: 2017-11-10 01:42:14
Let's be fair. You are totally assuming I went Clinton ;) I could not vote for that Clinton, she's been involved in too much controversy before being a candidate for me to trust.

The paradise papers are released and tells us how all of the wealthy are legally and unethically avoiding millions in taxes. 
But the IRS cares about regulating a market it doesn't even recognize as a real currency... /sigh 
This administration is ruining our country.
Edit: Poor grammar originally
@_date: 2017-11-12 09:34:39
I'm not saying he didn't move it. But wouldn't just the rumor alone drive the price even lower for him to accumulate more?
@_date: 2017-11-05 05:59:06
No you really can't.

What's the best way to dump the b2x without replay protection implemented?
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:29:46
Yup, that is the FCC's go to rebuttle. But this ignores that while a customer might not pay 80 dollars a month for internet, a business will pay thousands to have untethered internet.
And since the FCC believes all businesses are good guys, they don't care to regulate them. The one thing I can guarantee is, humans are greedy. Especially unsupervised humans.
@_date: 2017-11-03 02:03:42
Literally pay more to charge your phone than you make :P
@_date: 2017-11-03 00:45:22
You can keep it on the exchange. The exchange could decide what to do with your coin. The fork could credit you an = amount btc to b2x. The prices could climb or sink. There are a lot of options that require an important decision coming up soon.

My bad. My culturally limited experiences (an American) makes me think everyone must be from the USA. I have zero knowledge of other countries tax programs. 
@_date: 2017-10-13 21:38:51
You love tax incentives. It pays for your roads and education to be able to have this conversation. 
You hate paying taxes is more appropriate. And really you should expect to pay something. So it's more like "you hate paying so much in taxes".
With that in mind. Let's say joy make 100k from bitcoin. You apply for a house, the money has to be accounted for (red flag if your paying the same in taxes but suddenly have a house in your name). Same for most expensive purchases. 
Now if you paid for your groceries and day to day expenses with your 100k from bitcoin it's unlikely the government would ever find out. 
But think about this. If you are well enough off to pay taxes on capital gains... Then return the favor and pay your share of taxes so your roads are smooth driving home. You are benefiting from taxes.

Honestly do your homework. Research the market and give a presentation to your parents. Sell them on the idea first and ask if they can help you set up an account. Show them you are genuinely interested and believe it is a good future investment and I don't see why your parents wouldn't help you if you earned the initial investment. Tell them you understand the risks and could lose it all and are prepared for that. 
Plus. You can always recycle the presentation as a school project at some point. 
@_date: 2017-10-31 14:27:06
We aren't claiming it doesn't stop. We simply think it stops much later. If I had to guess approximately moon-ish it'll level off.
