Anyone else love how the undercover account is named "UC-1"? As in "Undercover 1"?

Interesting; So if the process goes something like: 


Where in this process does the 1% commission take place?

Thanks for the detailed response!
I'm actually the seller in this situation. Have a tight time frame and wanted to check if it was reasonable to leave if needed.
Between localbitcoins a/nd bitrated: do you have a preference/suggestions?

When discussing bitcoin, whenever someone mentions "selling some things" I can't help but assume SilkRoad :)

Exactly! I'm as libertarian as the next guy and fully support bitcoin, but this sounds like it could be trouble

I apologize if the way I wrote this seems like I have a moral issue with this, I just find it difficult to fully believe/accept that we could potentially have boundless wealth by stumbling into a new type of money when it's cheap.
I'm not an economist, but think about it. What should the market cap of bitcoin be once it's fully adopted? It would have to be enough to cover a large percentage of all internet purchases. Along with that, it isn't unreasonable to assume this should happen within the next 30 years (a number I'm completely pulling out of my ass). 
So lets make up some numbers. Lets say the market cap needs to be 21 trillion (picked mainly because it's a high number and easily divisible by 21 million. Doesn't seem outrageous considering the USD will devalue by some amount by then as well; let me know if you don't consider this the case). That's $1000,000 USD for a single bitcoin in 30 years. Does that sound like a feasible rise in growth?

These are all great points, these things definitely need to happen. And, truly, they are starting. You can actually witness this from the chaos and instability surrounding the price. 
Bitcoin is reaching massive popularity. For the first time, Bitcoin is close to being a household name. People outside of the tech community are hearing about it for the first time and they're *excited*. 
This means more acceptance from small business owners, which if successful means future adoption from larger corporations. We're seeing governments on an international scale being forced to confront what the hell it even means and how to work with it. The media is going nuts over bitcoin. 
This has happened before (more than once) on smaller scales. It artificially drives the price due to a sudden demand, especially due to those more focused on it's skyrocketing monetary value (as opposed to social value).
One major difference today that many new users *are* focusing on the social value. In the past, a lot of the media hype was wary of bitcoin and much less understanding than it is today. Some of the fearful elements still exist, but the perspective is shifting our way. In fact, bitcoin just received one of it's [most important supporters](
What impact does this have on your concerns? Mainly that bitcoin is exiting the innovator stage and entering early adoption. It's becoming more important, and it will be nuts, but at some point the bitcoin will become much more commonplace. 
As adoption becomes widespread we won't be seeing surges of new adopters caused by media reports, which is a predominant factor of virtually every major price spike bitcoin's had so far.
Price spikes are also one of the main causes of day traders. I don't blame for seeing the fluctuating price as a major opportunity. It stirs up the pot, but I do imagine it introduces people to bitcoin for the first time, which is a fantastic thing. Day traders will still exist in the future (as they do for virtually all currencies), but the impact will be much less severe without the opportunity presented by price spikes.
With this social value and (hopefully) stability in play, gaps in the market are created for easier ways to purchase, store, and use bitcoins, which will undoubtably lead to an increase in adoption and frequency of use.

What makes you assume gold will be found on almost every rock planet? This sounds very unlikely. Why would gold be on Mars? Why would it be easier to mine gold on mars as opposed to earth? I get what you're saying about astroids, but you're making it sound like every astroid will have a shit ton of gold and be totally easy to bring this gold back to earth. You don't seem to be thinking how long of a time frame it would take to successfully mine and transport space gold.

This is a fascinating response; I've never really of bitcoin as primarily escrow/title/transaction system. Thanks so much for your response!
@_date: 2013-12-09 05:27:17
It's not an issue with conscience, I'm totally down to be rich as fuck. It just sounds... kinda nuts? Maybe it's a too good to be true sort of thing? Something about it just doesn't quite make sense; I guess it goes along with people's concerns of a high barrier of entry and bitcoin hoarding.

Thanks for this. What are your thoughts on Elliot wave analysis? I've been reading [S5302's]( occasional updates and have considered subscribing, but not quite sure... anyone have any success with this?

Nobody's saying it isn't feasible, pluribusblanks isn't arguing with you. It's going to take a while and will cost a ton of money, but you're right in that it is entirely feasible and will change the gold/silver markets when it happens.
So what else are you arguing? Are you saying don't invest in gold/silver?

Earths god *did* come from astroids, but these were small and seemingly infrequent (based on how rare and dispersed gold is on earth).
Lets take mars, for example. Mars is a close rocky planet, and thus the planet thats most feasible to mine. But why would there be more gold on mars than there is on earth? Mars should be hit by similar astroids that hit earth. If there is gold, it shouldn't be more prevalent on mars than on earth. Whatever quantity of gold *is* on mars is going to cost a lot more to mine than earth-gold.
Now, imagine how massive earth is. Virtually every element came from stars of some sort. Consider how rare gold is in relation to other elements. If every element came from somewhere else in the solar system (via astroid) the amount of gold-containing astroids that have/will hit earth are minuscule compared the number of astroids containing other elements. This should be true throughout our solar system as a whole.
