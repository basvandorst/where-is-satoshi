Looking at most of the CrypotCurrency price drops (many more than -50%), and many look like they are just about to die off. Wondering if this will hopefully remove many of the stupid currencies which makes CryptoCurrency look bad.

So, you are telling me I can point anywhere on the screen with this thing and what is it called again, oh yeah click it..... Right.  
The dollar whores are doing what they can to:  
1. Help the dollar in its last days  
2. Lower the price to get some of the disruptive technology at a cheaper price.  
3. Buy lots of their competition, then sell and buy to control the market.   
Love capitalism.

The Fiat is backed by nothing as well, it a corrupt system and will end as all Fiat currencies historically have. Once Nixon took the dollar off the gold standard he doomed the dollar and showed how evil the Federal Reserve really is.

So, from your reply, I am assuming you are attempting to state the US Government supports the dollar and is dependent on its survival. That is true but to state the US Government "Backs" the dollar is incorrect.

A government does not add value to a currency nor does it "back it" whatever that means. The velocity of the currency makes the currency valuable (i.e. demand) and the control of the creation is what makes it valuable (i.e. supply) controlled by the Federal Reserve (not government body, actually privately owned by share holders). What “backs” our currency is the debt it creates, in that, for every dollar of equity a dollar of debt exists. So when a dollar of debt is paid off, the dollar of equity is cancelled. 
Precious metals have an intrinsic value which has been uncontested for several thousands years, then along comes a debt currency and all the world believes the debt has greater value than the metal with intrinsic value. For something to be money there are several criteria:  
Durable, the medium must be able to stand the test of time.  
Portable, must hold a large amount of value in a small volume.  
Divisible, can be separated and put back together in anyway or form.  
Intrinsically Valuable, must have value in and of itself (paper is just paper &amp; data is just data).  
Fungible, must be mutually interchangeable with other mediums.  
So, yes Bitcoin is just a speculative investment at best, but come to think of it, so is the paper debt based dollar.   
@_date: 2017-10-12 22:13:16
Actually the US dollar is not a very good investment. When you have money you typically attempt to take it off the dollar since the the dollar is an inflationary currency, which means as time passes, you lose money.

The money comes from the people. This should be asked about the dollar and other Fiat currencies more often. Money is and always will be the expenditure of Energy (human) and Time. So when this Energy and Time is coagulated into BitCoin in Lieu of the Dollar, it is a step in the right direction.

Bitcoin is in its infancy, this is just the beginning of something much grander. There will be a day when someone with one Bitcoin is considered quite wealthy. Where some people work all their lives to amass enough wealth to have 1,000,000 bits.
