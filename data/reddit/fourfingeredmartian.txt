As we move into the future there exists the situation where we approach the fully realized quantity of Bitcoin, thus, its scarcity is reflected in the price.  As a currency it does exactly what a lot of people want -- to act as a store of value.  Further, it's practical to use as a medium of exchange.    You can have fiat  cash holdings, which,  has a rate of value deprecation of about 2% annually from the start date of "saving" (considered the optimal target amount of loss of stored value annual fro those that issue the the currency).  It's kinda better to go into debt over saving that currency, right? As the actual cost of said debt actually awards you a savings (assuming an annual interest rate owed on that debt amount is either equal, or greater than zero, but, less than actually realized amount of inflation over the set of time it takes you payback that loan).
Now, there exists a competitor that currently awards you saving...  I guess what I'm saying is simply get a credit card with a very high credit limit and as close to zero for the APR that exists....  Seems like an easy method to make quick cash while remaining debt neutral, or, go into debt on the gamble but realize the real gain comes from having the potential to have an asset of value for retirement...

I don't think you understand the dynamics of the situation.

Can anyone actually show proof a hack occurred?  Why hasn't one person stepped up to the plate and said -- hey I didn't make such a transactions.  Seemed like you had a lot of people that joined in the hype selling &amp; buying (mostly selling).
While you had others willing to buy at low bargain prices.  Seemed like a flash crash at this point with no proof of the hack actually taking place &amp; no one stepping up (thousands of people or even one person) stating they lost a single coin.

I agree, I just think it's pretty cool ;)

Gamble, if he cashes out now would have yielded $141,360 profit.
