We will be factoring in previous trade history and stats from Localbitcoin and Paxful as part of the verification process to help establish immediate ranking on the site.   
Paxful used to have this option a few years ago but is no longer utilizing it.

Yes. We will be factoring in previous history of both Localbitcoins and Paxful with the verification process and site ratings. The site is mapped for the most part and currently in the construction phase.
We are incorporated and run within the US and have a satellite company in India.

Unfortunately that's not the case. We have been informed that Paxful no longer uses that method by a reliable source. I was verified by that method 2 yrs ago and was given a "Legacy Badge" right away and instant previous trade volume on Pax because of my LBC account. A trader I've worked with for 2+ years in LBC with 0 neg feedback, +500 positive trades, over 300 different partners and 50-100 btc traded was informed that this method is no longer used. This information was verified over 6 months ago. There is is another trader that I know personally that I helped them start on Paxful that made their minimum of 20 different partners and 50 trades without issues and accepts 4 different payment methods has submitted the required documentation and video to get verified over three weeks ago now and yet no response to getting a verified status? These are just a few of the issues that will be addressed...

I and a few others have been faithful users on both sites without issues like getting banned for a few years now. We started this project with traders in mind and these ideas we will be implementing and improving on have been suggested to both Pax and LBC but to no avail were they even considered. Yes I do agree a great majority of those who get banned do violate the ToS agreement.

What are your thoughts on the two sites you currently trade with? Pro's and con's
@_date: 2018-10-19 14:17:17
These are problems that we intend to overcome. However if someone is banned with justified cause such as attempted scamming and there is proof of that then of course they wouldn't be allowed to withdraw funds until reported scam or dispute was resolved. If the ToS is followed correctly then no one should experience any issues. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 23:08:02
If the funds were not ill gotten gains then there is no reason to keep them from the owner of the funds. This means don't scam people and there shouldn't be an issue. Problems arise between traders often. The key to a resolve is a quick amicable arbitrated solution. When there is slow admin response to these situations lost funds occur and good honest traders lose out.

We have looked at Bisq.network and a few other projects. The platform for Bisq is an interesting concept but not very "user friendly" for a new trader or someone with limited technical knowledge. We agree that each platform has it's pro's an con's so we can only hope to provide a user friendly site with easy interface that will attract a large enough base to securely and safely trade for the the average person.

I do agree that the btc may have been theirs to keep. Just place a ban for violation of ToS. Great question to ponder - If I'm trading on multiple sites and come across the same customer on the other site and begin to do most of my trades there and not on the original site. Is it a violation of the ToS? Just curious on how people feel about this.

We will be looking for beta testers in the next few months for input and functionality. These few traders will also be given a chance to trade on the site with reduced escrow fees for a period of time once the site is live. Of course real BTC will be needed during the testing process. 
Would you be interested?

We just started this project. Feel free to follow the thread.

The build is expected to take about 3 more months as we would like to thoroughly test and be stable.  (Glitches suck for everyone). Yes we can contact you. We should have the under construction page up in a few days and you can drop an email there to get updates.  We will also be looking for beta testers very soon to check links, functionality and provide suggestions. I will provide to the site address here once the page is activate.
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:49:11
We will release that information in a few months closer to the official launch of the platform. 
@_date: 2018-10-24 11:49:59
We will be revealing the site name and some of the features closer to launch. There is a projected build time of about 3 months. The base planning process has been completed and domain names have been successfully secured. 
@_date: 2018-10-23 10:57:59
Great. Will PM you in a few days. Thanks

Actually our market budget was never disclosed. What is your reference to shitty "communication skills"? 
Quite frankly you seem like a generic troll with no decent input. Please don't waste your time unless you can provide proof of your trading credentials on either of the sites mentioned in the post....
@_date: 2018-10-30 11:08:11
This has been discussed thoroughly and resolved with some proprietary back end security protocols. I cannot discuss how it works but rest assured it was a concern that we are confident in tackling.

Don't plan on any short term gains, especially using your debit/credit card. The fees alone to buy with that method are extremely high and you are limited with a new account to buying volume.
@_date: 2018-10-18 20:34:19
We are looking into about a 4-7 month site build and beta test. Apologies for my lack of technical terminology but "phase atm"? 
We have currently 4 Pro Traders on LBC that say they are committed to trying out the platform and 3 Legacy Badged Paxful Traders as well.
