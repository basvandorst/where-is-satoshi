There is one, but you should know that browser extensions are dangerous in that other extensions can gain access to the data in them depending on how they are configured.

"Seems Legit" 
Yo, seriously though? A+  bonus points for not even pretending that this isn't a scam. Holy fuck. This is some old school 2010 balls-out bitcoin scam shit. None of the fancy language and hiring actual call center people for a week to pretend you're legit. Just straight up "Give us your money and for absolutely no reason you'll 100% guaranteed get back more" 1920's boiler-room shit. This is how it's done, people! I hope you guys have sweet mustaches.
God-speed, bitlife-safe, truly you were the best of us all.

Depending on what OP paid for the box, this might be much more than the expected profit that they would have gotten for mining indefinitely. 
I believe the total expected lifetime profit for mining with a Jalapeno you paid  $150 for and received today is like $200. If OP is in that boat, this is almost $100 more than that.

People have understood for a very long time that confirmation dialogs are not useful UI constructs. People cognitively "chunk" the behavior of clicking "send" then clicking the "confirm" dialog into the same action without a mental break in between to consider it. This is why you don't see those any more on ~most good software, instead you get "undo" buttons and other tools.
Asking someone to enter something twice is also of limited utility, from a UI perspective, but definitely an improvement.

Yeah, you were probably looking at a £65 return at best before it started costing more to run than you were making, so you are significantly better off. 
I'll echo everyone here's concern that you would have to be a complete dumbass to actually pay the £600 you were offered, so the odds of scam are high. If you haven't pulled the money out of paypal yet, do it ASAP.

... Is that a serious question? 
If you think the bitcoins will be worth more in the future, the economically advantageous move is _still_ to sell the hardware now, and simply buy bitcoins with it.
I don't understand where everyone gets this ludicrous notion in their heads that somehow mining fewer bitcoins than it cost to pay for the miner is somehow going to pay off for them.
