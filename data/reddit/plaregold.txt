bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies were designed to be used as a decentralized means of exchange, not a store of value. If you actually believe in the technology behind cryptocurrencies, then you'd realize that the current value of cryptos far exceeds its purported utility. The value is supported by pure speculation. Bitcoin means nothing and has no value if no one is buying anything in cryptocurrency. So few vendors actually take it. And why would you spend it if you think its value is increasing? And why would a vendor take it if its value can decrease overnight? Volatility is not a desirable trait in currency. Crypto as it is now discourages people from spending it and using it for its intended purpose. Anonymity and decentralization's not enough of an incentive for the majority of people to switch from traditional currencies. As it is, someone is going to be left holding a bag of shit just like any other hype based pump and dump schemes.

HODLer's, what's your reasoning? Do you think there will be more suckers with money buying into get rich quick dreams?

Do you see how faulty the logic is? There isn't an infinite supply of suckers with money to lose. Just because crypto hasn't hit that limit before, doesn't mean it won't in the future. You're just betting that right now there's still enough suckers to drive crypto value to another higher peak.
Online poker used to be a lot more lucrative for skilled players nearly a decade ago at the height of its popularity when a lot of suckers got in and got fleeced.
