This uses the arduino just to generate a 256-bit number in binary. I do want to thank you. I found your prototype video online and used a lot of it as inspiration. I went through a few tries with a tft touchscreen on the arduino but came to the same conclusion as you did.

I would love for someone to check how secure it is and if there are any flaws to let me know about it.

To test the rng, I am running it on a loop right now to generate 100,000 private keys. When it finishes in a few days, I will upload the results to pastebin and put them here for everyone to see and test.

I agree that the TREZOR is amazing, but it is quite expensive, and the incapability with mobile phones is a little annoying. What I was looking more for is as compared to other online wallets, like green wallet or hive where you control your mnemonic.

How long until new individual enrollment clears?

I agree that the TREZOR could cost $19, but the $119 is too much for some people. I work part-time at Starbucks and go to school full time. I have a few hundred dollars in Bitcoin and want to keep it safe. The TREZOR is inarguably the best way to store Bitcoin, but at a price tag of $119, it's out of the ball park for my precious bitcoins. The amount of Bitcoin that I hold is around 20% of all my assets, so even the few hundred I hold is very important to me. I'm not asking for a $19 locked version to prove the price, I'm looking for an entry level so that I can protect my Bitcoin, without spending a serious percentage of my bitcoins.

Well I'm working at Starbucks and going to school full time so the ~$100 I have in Bitcoin is quite a large percentage.

I have a few hundred in Bitcoin. I wasn't an early adopter, but I have followed it since before it was worth $1. I believe in the currency so how much I hold is worth doesn't really bother me. It's stayed around the same price for me. The point I'm making is that my Bitcoin is almost a 1:1 conversion from the money I put in, so buying a TREZOR with Bitcoin is close to buying it with money for me. And at the $119 price tag, even if I bought it off of amazon for USD, which I personally feel against, it would be expensive for me. I just wish that they had a cheaper version.

Kind of but not really. The big thing with Bitreserve is that it removes all volatility from your Bitcoin if you decide to do so. Its pretty amazing.

It was tagged 4 hours ago, and there's already been over 1k commits to master? Wat?

I would love to use the service, but on my iPhone 6, there are no links or ways to load the card. I have my email in but I cannot find anything to load the card.

So I want to clear some of this post up. I am 17 and live in the US. When it comes to a minor (anyone under 18) opening a bank account, they are a co-owner with a parent or legal guardian. This means, even though I have my own job and I make my own money, because I put it into my bank account, my parents have full legal control over my money and can do whatever they want with it. The other issue, is that in the same way I cannot open my own bank account, no company that is required to follow the same laws, such as circle or coinbase or any bitcoin exchange, can handle my money, as that money is not legally mine, it is mine and my parents. I am lucky enough that circle allows parents to sign off on minors, and I have been able to buy bitcoin through them. Just clearing some things up.

In the US a minor has to open either a UGMA or a UTMA account, which both are owned by your parents.

Augh! I just found this and want to get an account and beta access but I'm stuck at work without a computer for the next 6 hours. Hopefully I get home in time.

For cca you need to use background scripts. Dark wallet uses a background page. I have tried starting all of the different scripts in an automatically generated background page, but it doesn't function properly. I need help with creating the background script.

I'll take suggestions here on reddit as well.

Great work guys. Good day all around.
