He's sent this because Bitcoin Belle called him Fatoshi because of his moobs, which was immature. But this is pathetic. I remember when he promised the world he'd never appear in front of a camera again. Now he's stripping for upvotes.

It only makes sense to bet on it being passed. If you bet on it passing, then you will receive your winnings if you're right, and the value of your winnings will rise as a result of it passing too. If you think it will be rejected then you will receive your winnings if you're right, but that will be offset by the drop in value of BTC. You'll get a better return by cashing your wager out to fiat in an exchange now, and buying back in after the ETF has been rejected (if you're right). By the way, I don't think it will be approved either.

Are you kidding? I read that article and it left me utterly convinced that he is a classic conman.
@_date: 2017-03-08 22:53:36
It was obvious because he couldn't back up any of his claims, and his excuses for why he kept failing to deliver became increasingly incredible and complicated as time went on. A good conman tells a good story, and sucks people in with the richness and drama of his fantasy, but ultimately relies on the winning the trust of his mark, rather than producing evidence of his claim. The tax evasion issue back home and the manufacturer of his supercomputer saying they never sold it to him. Obviously he was claiming millions in Australian government subsidies on his capital expenses for research. He offered up the evidence time and time again claiming that he was Satoshi, and time and time again, every piece of evidence he produced was shown to be unverifiable, doctored, or forged Ask yourself why the real Satoshi would try to pass off false evidence to authenticate himself, when he is one of the world leading experts in cryptographic authentication. Large passages of his academic work had also been shown to be plagiarized. Could couldn't ask for a more stereotypical conman. Your turn, what convinced you that he must be the real deal?

And incidentally, this is why the BitMex prediction market for approval/rejection of the COIN ETF is skewed in favour of approval. It doesn't make as much sense to bet on rejection. The real probability of approval is at least half of the probability indicated on BitMEX.

You still pay a fee for making the bet, it's the exchanges spread on the odds. And that will be more expensive than the transaction fee on a trade.

It's madman game theory. The miners have to convince the developers and everyone else that they are crazy and determined enough to risk everything, in hope that they can force developers and users to compromise. It's a dangerous game of brinkmanship, and I think this fork will be damaging to bitcoin, but probably only temporarily.

Yes, you've got it! The integrity of the system does not matter to everyone. For some people the only important thing is that it benefits them personally. If it doesn't benefit them tomorrow, then they can jump to another system that reflects a different historical record, and keep hopping between systems trying to maintain a historical record that aligns to their preferences. But for others it's more important to have a reliable system, even when the historical record isn't what they would have chosen.

And in case it wasn't clear, what I mean is that consensus was not reached across the community. The decision was made quickly. As I understand it some of the devs were invested in the DAO, and one of the devs wrote the code to rollback the blockchain, and the miners pushed it. It's reminiscent of government lobbyists pushing policies and agendas due to conflicts of interest. Blockchain was once heralded as offering a solution to the idea of corrupt trusted third parties calling the shots.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:05:19
What's hard to prove about what I said though? Are you saying it's hard to prove that some devs were invested? Hard to prove that a dev wrote the code to rollback? Hard to prove that the miners pushed it? Hard to prove that there was no community wide survey or vote to gather consensus? Or do you accept those points?

I deposited ETH 48 hours ago and it hasn't been credited yet. Raised a support TT 2 days ago, no response from them at all. Doesn't look good.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:07:47
Who wrote the code for the rollback?
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:29:01
How did the community vote to rollback the chain?

Motion: The ice age should not be extended without at least some decrease in block rewards.
In the case of the proposition, we would like to have a differentiation on the preferred per-block minimum rewards

I should elaborate, I am certain that Craig Wright is not Satoshi, have been since he published the fraudulent proof. But Ian Grigg's insistence that he has direct knowledge that Craig Wright is the 'greater part' of the team that created bitcoin bothers me. The explanation is probably simple; he was duped by a conman and is too proud to admit it, so he sticks to his guns and remains adamant the conman is Satoshi. But I'm surprised that Ian would be tricked by someone that had no real proof to offer. It doesn't sit well, an irritating loose end.
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:45:24
That's possible. Satoshi finally finds someone that's willing to carry the burden of being Satoshi, and helps him on his way. But I don't think Grigg is Satoshi. There's much better candidates.

Me too, and I got lots of free ETC out of it too. But I don't pretend that the Ethereum blockchain is immutable as per the original claim. Immutable unless it's inconvenient.
@_date: 2017-05-31 06:49:39
Have you got a link to the DAO vote?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:23:23
But how can your demonstrate that community consensus was there. You say that but have nothing to back it up. I was an Ethereum crowdsale investor and a DAO investor. I was there when the shit hit the fan. I was glad that I got my funds back, but I did not feel that there was any attempt to evaluate community wide support. Naturally a lot of people like me had vested interests, including some of the devs apparently. So we were all relieved to see history bring rewritten, but I recognised it for what it was; a loss of immutability, a less reliable blockchain that can have facts adjusted if they are inconvenient. I'm still a big supporter of Ethereum, but I don't fool myself that it is an immutable blockchain. If something undesirable happens tomorrow, everyone will think; why not rollback again? That thought would not occur with bitcoin. Everyone knows it's immutable.
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:02:25
I might believe you if you have any data to back that up? I suspect your can't offer any objective measurement.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:07:25
I'm familiar with the subreddit but if you checked the etc subreddit you would find that the majority aren't in favour. Many of them were also once part of the Ethereum community, some still are. I don't think community support was measured in any objective way, just hash power. Who wrote the code for the rollback?
@_date: 2017-05-04 18:50:11
Yes, his knowledge of cryptography is surface, enough to impress someone who knows very little but more learned observers will spot the waffle and inaccuracies a mile away. He doesn't possess the technical expertise required for the job.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:20:52
Do you know if any of the devs were invested in the DOA? Don't get me wrong, I'm happy if they were. They might not have got me my funds back if there wasn't a conflict of interest :-)
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:25:35
But if you don't agree with my fact that community consensus was never objectively measured, then you can believe in alternative facts.
@_date: 2017-05-30 21:46:36
It's more like agreeing on whether to rollback a blockchain if you are thousands of people.
@_date: 2017-05-30 20:56:50
So just the miners? Not the users?
@_date: 2017-05-30 22:37:26
Exactly, you are asking me to believe your feels. There is no factual basis to say that it had community support because there was no attempt to measure community support. Don't forget that the Ethereum Classic community were mostly once part of the Ethereum community that did not support the hard fork. Don't forget that anyone who was invested in the DAO, including myself, was compromised and unable to support either side objectively because of our financial interest in the decision. When you exclude DAO investors and include Ethereum Classic community you start to see a clearer picture of what objective community support looks like. The integrity of a blockchain is supposed to be like moral principles; sticking to them when it's convenient is unremarkable, sticking to them when it's inconvenient is where the value really lies.

XRP is angled as the banks coin because it had the same centralization weaknesses as BCH. It can be controlled, which is very appealing to banks.
