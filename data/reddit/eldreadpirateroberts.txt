You clearly have no idea what you are talking about. Hitmen were banned from SR, as was child pornography, guns, and anything intended to harm others.

Question  when did corrupt agents pwn the SR server?
Question  when did the DPR account chat with the redandwhite account?
Question  how many weeks after Ulbricht was arrested did someone sign into the DPR account?
Question  how were ISP image backups for SR chatlogs different than image backups submitted in evidence?
If you can't answer these questions, you don't know enough about the case to have an opinion.

You forget that the conversation between the 'dreadpirateroberts' admin account and the 'redandwhite' user account happened AFTER the corrupt NSA/CIA/DEA agents pwned the site. It would have been trivial for the agents to falsify this convo.
It is especially suspect given Ross' apparent 'schizophrenic' online behavior shift. He went from disallowing anything that harmed innocent people (including hitmen) and beautifully written philosophical treatise advocating the non aggression principle to clunky, mechanical, almost archetypal drug kingpin almost overnight.
Also, one other important side note. In the murder for hire convo, the DPR account initiated the hire because he was worried that "FriendlyChemist is a liability." DPR never revealed his identity to any of his administrators and could have simply removed his admin privs after discovering the stolen bitcoins. There was no "liability," and hence no motive.

You can't opsec the NSA, CIA, DEA cross department task force. Even if you are Vladimir fucking Putin.

That's because they weren't. Anything that harmed or was intended to harm or defraud others was explicitly forbidden on the SilkRoad. Careful who you believe on this thread. Most people on here have no idea what they are talking about.
