You can't apply these stats or even assume they are correct in any way because of the following reason:
1) there are many many address out there with miniscule or close to zero amounts of bitcoins. This really skews the stats,
for example suppose that there are 10 bit coins in total. 9 users have a bit coin each, and the there are a million addresses with 0.000001 bitcoins each. they were created by people going to trybtc.com once and forgetting they even used the service. These million addresses belong to no one, these people wouldn't be considered actual users, except when gathering statistics on wealth distribution. In my scenario, it would look like a small parentage of address contains more than 90% of the wealth.
Any statistical analysis of wealth distribution should be limited to address with a certain threshold, and probably with some activity in the last year.
2) one address != one person. One person can have hundreds of addresses, in fact some posts in the forum even encourage that, to reduce risk of theft. If I have a milllion dollars in bitcoin spread around 100 addresses, it looks like the money distribution is more even than if i keep this money in one address. Also, an address can belong to a business such Mt Gox, humble bundle, etc. comparing business revenues with everyone else isn't a good indicator of wealth distribution
3) doesn't take into affect people who created wallets with bitocoins but lost the harddrive, forgot the password and otherwise can't access the bitcoin

What is it like to live in a place with such massive inflation?
do you feel it in a daily lives that everything is getting more expensive? are wages adjusted monthly? how about rent? groceries? etc?

5 reasons why the US dollar is the most dangerous currency:
1) The US dollar has lost 97% of its value in 70 years. Highly deflationary. It's not even a bubble, it's just one massive crash
2) US dollars is the currency of choice for arm dealers, drug dealers, terrorists and assassins. A terrifying marketplace exists out there, where people hire assassins to kill others and pay them using US dollars.
3) Anyone accepting US dollars for any goods or services, beware, the IRS is investing heavily in taxing you, no matter where you are in the world.
4) US dollars can be stolen by anyone. No special skills is needed, unlike hacking bitcoins. in fact, just last year thieves stole 45$ million dollars in ATM Hacking:
5) If you lose a wallet full of money, the money is gone for good. There is no way to trace the bills, and get them back.
&lt;insert sob story, of a guy who had lots of money in his wallet, and threw it in the garbage by accident&gt;

let's ignore voter backlash and assume that majority of voters wouldn't care.
How would a law be written that bans businesses from accepting bitcoins?
if it's "no business shall accept bitcoin" then either bitcoin will change it's name, or another currency will be used.
if it's "no business shall accept crypto currencies", then a definition needs to be made up that defines what a crypto currency is. The problem is that business now accept different forms of payment: cash, credit card, checks, debit cards, gift cards, currencies from other countries, air miles, loyalty programs of some kind, coupons, and even IOU's.
how do you write a definition that permits all of theses, but excludes crypto currencies?

It's not worse in bitcoin. It's unknown what the distribution is in bitcoin for the following reasons.
1) private keys are lost all the time. A wallet might have 25 BTC in it from someone who opened an account years ago, but has no access to the money. does this person control any BTC wealth?
2) there are tens of thousands of bitcoins wallets with miniscule amount of money, and that skews the results a lot.
In real terms, imagine if you added 100 million to the total population of the US, and assigned each a wealth of 1 cent. would the top 1% control more or less of the total wealth?
3) one person != one wallet. This is the big one, i might have 1 million dollars in bitcoin, spread amount 1000 wallets. for determining distribution, this looks like 1000 different people own 10,000 dollars. On the other hand a business account can hold potential wages and expenses of 100 different people all in one wallet.

I tried buying an item and paying with bitcoin, but there wasn't an option during checkout. I assuming this is just their intentions to accept, but it's not implemented yet?
@_date: 2014-01-06 18:14:43
you're welcome :-)
again, not looking to profit like crazy, or time the market. I just wanted to say that i own some bitcoin, and 45$ is an amount i'm more than okay with parting and never seeing again. 
and since there is at least one merchant who i use that accepts bitcoin, i feel like i can spend bitcoins and get some value out of it.

translation for those who need it:
it says "For Sale" at the top,
with the phone number (a cell phone, there digits numbers that start with 05 as an area code are reserved for cell phones)
with the bitcoin symbol on the left, and they symbol for israeli shekels on the right

Are there any strategies people use to deal with inflation?
wouldn't taking lots of loans, and mortgages work in your favor, since the amount of money you need to give back is less than now?
How about buying some expensive TVs or other electronics, and be able to sell them at less than the inflation rate?
Since saving in peso isn't working, can you buy USD? Bitcoin? other currencies?

Again, you're missing the point. Bitcoin might have a fair distribution or a very unfair one. At this point we just don't know.
to be able to determine wealth distributions you need to know the following:
1) amount of people who have at least 50$ in bitcoin (or some other threshold, a few months ago i went to an introductory bitcoin website, that opened a wallet for me, and deposited 0.00023 BTC or some other small number. that shouldn't count), and have access to the private key, and can spend they bitcoin when they want.
2) Determine which wallets are used by businesses, and which ones are owned by people
3) know which person controls how many wallets.
 might be possible to determine, 2 &amp; 3 are not, and never will.
