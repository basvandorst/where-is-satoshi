Do you think that [this ]( eBay listing is legitimate? It’s just slightly cheaper than on Trezor’s website by about $25.00.

He would probably marry me if I did that lol. I will ask him to explain it and set me up a wallet!

They’re the ones that make the bird scooters! He liked it so much and hasn’t stopped mentioning it for months I can’t not have it for him haha

I’ve BEEN wanting to make one of these with him, I should get one of those too!

He’s not a clothing type of guy...I think because money for clothes could be money for crypto LOL. But he does like all the memes...maybe a good meme shirt!

I do that every day! (:

Thanks! Will do!

Haha, he has so many already! Also I have no idea how ��. I don’t know his wallet address and asking would give away the surprise! 
@_date: 2018-10-15 05:58:54
I think I remember him mentioning this! He does not have a hardware wallet! Awesome! I’ll definitely get him one of these!!

Doesn’t have to be any special day of the week for that (;

He just got the bitcoin standard! Yes he loves books! Great idea, thanks!

I am also getting him a Xiaomi Scooter so it’s racking up to be a black label birthday lol. So I’ll take your advice! I also saw these indestructible steel back up things to replace paper, do you think that’s worth it?
