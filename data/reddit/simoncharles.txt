The Beats logo is actually surprisingly creative. It depicts a 'b' as well as headphones on a head. Simple but smart logos are very difficult to come up with.

People who only occasionally follow charts are really easily "fooled" by them. It's mostly about the perspective. 
Just read some product reviews comparing performance, for instance. For some underlying reason, they often use bar charts which don't start from zero. For instance comparing the figures '60' and '70' it can be made to look like the product with 70 is doubly faster than the one with 60, because they cut off at 50 or something like that.
You need to be very observant in general when reading charts, especially when the differences start getting big. Keep your eye on the digits on the axes.

First, let me make it clear that this is not an opinion and I have no expertise on the matter. It's just something I noticed, and would be curious to the explanation or to hear some opinions.
[1986–1988-ish of that chart](
This part of the chart looks pretty similar to the bitcoin/dotcom one. I realize OP is not saying the dotcom thing will **necessarily** happen again, but is issuing a friendly warning. So could the Bitcoin chart **potentially** be at the 1988 mark and continue to rise after this? If not, why not? 
I haven't been really interested in economics and markets that much, but I come into contact with it through my work and bitcoin has proved an interesting thing to follow, so I thought I might learn something in the process. What happened around '86-'87-'88 that caused the spike, and why did it continue upwards instead of tanking? 
I do know about what happened in 2008, but here we are back almost at the peak again. If we compare it to Bitcoin, who lost the most because of this massive drop, and who gained? Why is it back at the top? Remember, these are only dumb questions, I'm trying to understand :).
