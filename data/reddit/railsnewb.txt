After 1 month the coins go into garbage collection and are rewarded to miners in the next block. All I can recommend is that you don't listen to me because I'm talking a load of shit. Good luck.

Ummm no.
It would only be a 20% return if you also sold it, and if you sold it that means you thought it wouldn't go any higher.
You can't win whatever you do.

Welcome to the internet where people come from all over the world. 
Good luck trying to get people for whom English isn't their native language to follow your ideals.

It was never best in the business. At one point it was the only one in the business, but that was a long time ago. It has been plagued with issues since day 1.

This is actually a pretty good theory. 
The big miners need to constantly expand to remain competitive so they need to take their profits to buy/build more hardware.
This is only going to get worse as a side effect of exponentially growing difficulty. As long as the difficulty rises this fast they HAVE to sell the BTC to keep up.
This is actually quite an interesting phenomena... if it is true it means that there will be a correlation between the amount of freshly minted BTC that are moved in that week and the rate at which difficulty is going up (acceleration, not speed). 
Would be cool if somebody could throw together a chart to show if this correlation actually exists.
Edit: [Correlation confirmed]( OP is a genius. Also this doesn't appear to work during periods of high demand because so many people are buying that it gets masked.

Wow we are 3.5% up in 24 hours... just wait for the next 20% drop that occurs in less than 6 hours.

I agree that that is ideal, however it is difficult to stop people from just making multiple accounts and mining from multiple machines, thus increasing their income.

When the price gets low enough that it's no longer profitable for the miners they have to sell their existing reserves in order to fuel their expansion, which they need to do to keep up with the difficulty increases...
Expect a massive drop soon.

this is actually good for bitcoin

no no no, log scale only becomes accurate after the crash has started
