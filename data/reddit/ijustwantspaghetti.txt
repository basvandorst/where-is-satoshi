how the heck is he a billionaire?
@_date: 2017-08-16 11:53:23
I highly doubt that someone without internet in the first place is going to buy and use bitcoin
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:21:47
LOL, this is funny. I didn't get it when I saw the toaster, but i get it now.
@_date: 2017-08-05 19:11:06
This subreddit is way better than r/btc
@_date: 2017-08-13 21:51:12
LOL, sounds like most people are planning to hodl
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:29:05
one my dad asks to buy bitcoin and all his friends know about bitcoin then i know it it has gone mainstream. that's what i'm waiting for. facebook level mainstream is when everyone knows about it and wants a piece of it.
@_date: 2017-08-07 01:22:57
how about eating your butt instead
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:31:51
that must've taken days
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:26:06
wow BCH is slow as poooop
@_date: 2017-08-15 20:48:30
that's crazy, who knows what they could do with your passport info, it could be still out there somewhere.  I bought 2 coins for 600 in 2013 through coinbase then it dropped to 200, but i held on to them because i believed in the tech.  just wish i had bought more at the time.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:11:20
seriously? how could they not know that bitcoin is a currency...maybe if you didn't capitalize it
@_date: 2017-08-03 23:32:51
its interesting how there are so many more demands against exchanges and threats of lawsuits in the last few months as they've been hit with more customers. back when the internet first came out, i waited up to an hour for the dial in to connect and most of the time it disconnected.
@_date: 2017-08-03 00:40:55
Did they really just tilt it slightly?
@_date: 2017-08-01 12:08:28
I'm not worried, i want to buy btc but not while its forking.
@_date: 2017-08-05 23:04:06
wonder why he deleted his post
@_date: 2017-08-18 17:12:36
are they referring to bitcon cash? why does it say high of 374?
@_date: 2017-08-21 12:01:20
I agree with you, they are the true visionaries behind facebook.  When i see Zuckerberg I think fraud.  A good person wouldn't have done what he did.  
@_date: 2017-08-18 11:53:44
what is bitpay?
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:36:23
It was things like this that made me sell most of my bitcoin for ethereum. the drama is not good.
@_date: 2017-08-15 12:31:11
wow, passport? why would you send them your passport?  and international bank transfer?  geez and we think we have it rough with coinbase.
@_date: 2017-08-01 11:54:33
is it forking or not? i don't get the jargon.
@_date: 2017-08-15 22:17:36
Hello, i'm new here and so far I like the memes, especially the rollercoaster one.
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:05:52
but, what about the tulips?
@_date: 2017-08-19 08:38:45
if there is a downfall to bitcoin it will be because of the drama
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:32:03
lol, what is the difference in r/btc?
@_date: 2017-08-19 13:18:32
maybe decentralization cannot work due to human desire for greed and power.
@_date: 2017-08-01 20:06:53
brought my spaghetti
@_date: 2017-08-04 02:29:45
I joined both but i decided i like r/bitcoin better. more memes here.
@_date: 2017-08-05 13:44:29
I wouldn't trust my money to someone that writes things like "If a thing smell like shit, you don't have to taste."
@_date: 2017-08-16 12:05:25
this is cool, but is anyone really going to use this?
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:25:28
damn, people finding bitcoin left and right today. i better check my stuff
@_date: 2017-08-06 17:15:16
who is this guy and why is he so important 
@_date: 2017-08-11 23:26:24
why is the gif not working, that is the best part
@_date: 2017-08-13 17:23:50
nice plan. i will most likely explore the world too, but not in a yacht because that seems dangerous.  
@_date: 2017-08-07 09:35:53
If this guy can figure out how to set up a wallet and accept transactions, then there is hope for mainstream america
@_date: 2017-08-17 16:22:45
Wow, so many people finding random things with bitcoin inside today
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:32:58
good guy right here
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:16:57
just look at jamie dimon's face, that is the face of a crook
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:39:42
this person sounds unstable, unfortunate that he's tied to bitcoin. i'm sure plenty of people made money early on from bitcoin, why is this psycho being noticed.
@_date: 2017-09-21 18:59:43
Guys, just let it go
@_date: 2017-09-21 11:41:23
why are there so many unstable and pscyho people associated with bitcoin
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:40:32
bloody hell!
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:09:00
what is breadwallet?
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:20:55
he has a punchable face
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:24:50
this is also posted in litecoin as litegoin guy
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:10:20
Poor charloe, man u guys are mean
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:00:11
it was bitcoin for sure
@_date: 2017-09-06 12:11:24
i wonder if they called it tulips
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:03:25
i'm trying to understand how someone could get killed from bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-09-23 01:12:52
Are we getting extra coins again?
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:20:32
why are you laughing?
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:23:42
@_date: 2017-10-17 23:15:06
i started listening to it and his voice was too nasally to continue
@_date: 2017-09-15 23:19:10
i have to watch the full video with music to get the full effect of this celebration
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:32:11
really? i bought bitcoin in 2013 but was not clued in at all to what caused the crash (did not read reddit or news).  I holded through the drop though
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:16:08
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:09:03
Make sure you have 2fa on all accounts
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:48:56
pretty soon there will be a tax for pooping
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:59:17
Give it back
@_date: 2017-09-22 21:59:49
Is it safe in gemini, bittrex, coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-26 12:35:48
does it have to be bloody?
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:44:26
since when are we friends with russia?
@_date: 2017-09-16 19:27:43
Oh i see, i've seen the name breadwallet and was going to look it up but forgot
@_date: 2017-09-12 23:04:36
jamie dimon knows exactly what bitcoin is and what it could do. he's not stupid, he's been studying this for many years.
@_date: 2017-09-15 12:32:11

@_date: 2017-09-16 16:28:43
does coinbase have a mobile wallet?
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:42:25
 i thought this was a joke, but seriously?  is there anything they don't ban?
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:09:26
jeezus christ, jamie dimon this jamie dimon that, jaime dimon all over the main page
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:14:23
Thanks for the pep talk leo
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:52:20
how do you gift this, is there a website to get this from?
@_date: 2017-09-09 23:44:01
incredibly smart and humble man.
@_date: 2017-09-08 00:50:36
what about mtgox?
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:27:50
What mobile wallet apo do you use?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:14:23
Thanks for the pep talk leo
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:43:31
Would never use bitcoin on that
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:23:01
what is the difference between using the atm vs using coinbase?
@_date: 2017-09-29 15:33:18
Is it two separate forks now? Is one at the end of this month and one in nov?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:22:32
i live in chicago and have yet to see a bitcoin atm or 'bitcoin accepted here' sign.
@_date: 2017-09-13 19:04:42
How much you want to bet a few months from now, dimon will be saying he was wrong about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-22 23:21:39
Well it stuck in gemini for now cause withdrawel limit
@_date: 2017-10-10 17:19:56
How do you create a meme with this image, want one ready for when my dad tells me about bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-09-22 20:57:07
What is this about?
@_date: 2017-10-01 14:04:00
no one owns bitcoin, how do we explain that to the relevant parties?
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:41:54
You are paranoid, its a good thing in crypto
@_date: 2017-09-23 18:17:29
Buy the rumor?
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:15:09
when did swatting become a thing?
@_date: 2017-09-10 12:24:39
yeah i dont get it, the whole bitcoin atm thing is odd'
@_date: 2017-10-10 21:42:35
He’s the leader we need right now
@_date: 2017-10-17 13:34:10
What is lopp and is it normal to get swatted?
@_date: 2017-09-08 22:30:44
wait a minute, aren't most of the bitcoin miners in china? how does that work?
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:19:32
how does this move so fast? 
@_date: 2017-09-29 12:54:28
hey guys, what exchanges will support the hard fork?  i want to be prepared to trade my extra bitcoin forks. what is the probability of the fork happening? 
@_date: 2017-10-16 00:35:54
more memes probably
@_date: 2017-10-08 22:26:45
Lol was waiting for this
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:15:01
I still don't get it. isn't it easier to just use coinbase? or is this intended for people without internet?
@_date: 2017-10-12 13:12:08
congrats bitcoin, you win. for now.
@_date: 2017-10-17 12:54:30
when is the fork again?
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:41:08
i think the hackers are from UK, they way they write is different
@_date: 2017-10-09 22:14:14
you think the US govt cares about making money? they'll just tax us more if they find out they missed out.
@_date: 2017-09-16 17:25:42
@_date: 2017-09-18 15:24:10
If u bought at 3000 u made 1k
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:23:09
i'm pretty sure this is a female
@_date: 2017-09-16 11:47:27
@_date: 2017-09-09 20:45:57
maybe he lost his private keys?
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:18:20
awesome monopoly man or woman
@_date: 2017-10-17 16:17:25
And i think he meant to say thermos
@_date: 2017-09-18 00:24:44
what next? toasters?
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:10:20
Poor charloe, man u guys are mean
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:40:33
Its too risky for them, they don’t like rollercoasters
@_date: 2017-09-14 18:09:03
Make sure you have 2fa on all accounts
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:44:35
Weren’t the whales playing games on the way down
@_date: 2017-09-10 17:13:11
wow cool, most of them are at currency exchanges, oh yeah now i do remember seeing the 'we sell bitcoin' sign in lincoln park
@_date: 2017-09-22 00:26:13
jamie dimon pooped
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:41:06
Its a rollercoaster for sure
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:14:40
noob question, but how do you pay with bitcoin? do you need some sort of mobile app?
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:23:13
i like this guy, not afraid to tell jamie dimon what's up
@_date: 2017-09-28 15:43:33
Geezus this makes me want to sell buttcoin asap
@_date: 2017-10-18 01:18:33
more like a tetanus shot
@_date: 2017-09-13 02:16:13
its not insured either
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:36:50
mmmm nacho cheese
@_date: 2017-10-15 23:54:31
LOL, at least you tried. I tried as well and no interest either, but we're still early adopters.
@_date: 2017-10-04 23:22:11
i'm pretty sure this is a girl
@_date: 2017-10-01 13:33:51
it's interesting how with Ethereum, everyone knows Vitalik is the leader so there's no drama there.  With bitcoin there's no leader, no founder and that is causing the issues.  There's all these people that have established themselves as bitcoin authorities and are looking to take control.
@_date: 2017-10-12 10:43:15
Is that the purpose?
@_date: 2017-10-17 00:46:11
@_date: 2017-10-05 01:53:12
look closely, the eyebrows
@_date: 2017-10-11 19:45:36
Does he really ask for free lunch all the time?
@_date: 2017-09-29 20:12:28
Where do people find these gifs? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-13 12:20:04
i think there are still people waiting for it to go below 3k
@_date: 2017-05-13 23:29:31
Do you live in New York?
@_date: 2017-07-28 17:30:15
f&amp;&amp;k the dollar
@_date: 2017-07-21 00:25:46
what about that other fork?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:13:06
who's staying up all night?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:01:09
lol, good one
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:03:08
um, why are there 4?
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:00:33
lol, forgot the question mark.
@_date: 2017-07-28 12:01:42
i thought nigeria was the fraud capital
@_date: 2017-07-25 22:44:09
so? you going to charge all the 100s of ICOs?
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:20:31
why do men marry this type of woman in the first place?
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:49:38
I keep getting calls from the IRS telling me that i'm going to be arrested
@_date: 2017-07-07 20:49:03
IRS would never give up, there is tax $$ at stake here and they want it
@_date: 2017-07-19 13:47:05
does it mean that it will be implemented right away or on Aug 1? also, do we need to worry about moving coins off exchanges?
@_date: 2017-07-30 18:19:14
awww first world wife problems.
@_date: 2017-07-31 23:14:14
first they said no fork because miners were signaling 80% and now there is a fork after all.
@_date: 2017-09-16 16:15:06
why did this moron wait and not buy it at 3k
