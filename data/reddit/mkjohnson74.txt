I DCA'd my way into a nice portfolio over the last 4 years. Best.Strategy.Ever.

I sold some bcash for BTC to give to Andreas. Thought it was apt.

Started in 2013 but I started tracking my portfolio in April 2017, made this in August I think. It was accurate at the time.

Why angry? Crypto gets exposure on the largest social network on earth. What are all altcoins valued against?
@_date: 2014-06-07 04:06:25
How so?

How can we get google to return blockchain.info address information when searching for a bitcoin wallet address? I think that would be the easiest way to validate a paper wallet. Currently I have to scan the QR code with my barcode reader, then copy and past to blockchain.info. It would be awesome if google could just return the result.

Would you rather they introduce bitcoin directly and get any possibility of crypto-tipping on Facebook banned forever?

In the 1980's I'm sure Apple and IBM were PISSED when all the clone and alt-computers came out. Did that hurt the adoption of personal computing overall? That was rhetorical since I am typing this on a computer and you are reading it on one.

Aren't there certain groups on reddit that you can't invoke the tipping bots in?

I think bitcoin does have an unfairly tarnished image. Having a near-zero value crypto with a cute logo makes it a bit easier to get into and have fun with. If it takes off, bitcoin still wins as EVERY crypto is valued in BTC. Bitcoin IS the standard by which all alts are valued.

Having been on both sides of the credit fence, bitcoin is a beauty way to go for online purchases.

How about we start a special interest group in NYC that only accepts donations in bitcoin? Let Citizens United and BitLicense fight it out?

It's already in the works.

The Bitcoin blockchain is ~32GB, you can download the text-only version of Wikipedia as-is at 25GB. The decentralization would help to reduce Wikipedia's operating costs, and blockchain consensus would ensure that the content is consistent across all nodes (so no bad actor could modify the content). 
A project like this could bring Wikipedia to people who live under censorship, have limited internet access, and preserve Wikipedia for all humanity.

Isn't a distributed ledger essentially a distributed database?
@_date: 2015-04-16 16:06:28
Um... not sure how to answer...
