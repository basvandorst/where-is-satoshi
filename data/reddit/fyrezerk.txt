I might have phrased that wrong. Bitcoin itself might be fairly secure technology, but the people who have been handling the Bitcoin services thus far have been the weak points. Sure a company like Google could do well to increase the stability and efficiency of Bitcoin tool/services (miners, exchanges, etc.) but at the same time they would completely dominate, and basically monopolize Bitcoin. They're a technology supergiant and if they wanted to, they could, for lack of a better term, make Bitcoin their bitch.

Because quite frankly, not everyone sees Bitcoin as "the next big thing."
Also you have to keep in mind that Google is a company and companies want profit. Why would Google push Bitcoin, which lacks relative stability and has shown multiple times it's prone to security exploits, when they can push their own ideas and make a much larger profit off of them?

In regards to the security point, I explained what I meant to say in a response to the above comment. That being said, the very fact that the people handling Bitcoin are practicing bad security might be another reason Google isn't interested. Overall I personally don't see Bitcoin mining/trading/exchanging being practiced very professionally at the moment. When that changes then maybe some of the bigger players might be interested.

Your scales are completely different, this data is completely skewed just for the sake of looking accurate...
