It has been on a rise far too long, I think a dip is soon but not anywhere below 10k
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:27:18
It was crazy watching this live
@_date: 2019-07-06 21:36:26
Actually their premiums are larger than Coinbase
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:36
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:33:27
Bitcoin will only go farther as it reaches more investors and hedge funds, we are in a great time my friend
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:29:47
And it's still shooting up 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:22:20
There is always a risk buying in at the all time high, but also the sooner you plant your feet the better. I would hold off and wait for a dip but do some research beforehand 
@_date: 2019-07-05 22:55:44
Electroneum has the best mobile miner
@_date: 2019-07-15 22:41:40
buy now or regret later
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:25:30
Take your science outta here 
@_date: 2017-12-06 22:36:53
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:39:11
Same congrats bro
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:25:55
IT'S UNREAL
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:39:37
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:35:42
Go on gdax.com make an account and purchase whatever currency you would like as hold onto it. I don't know much about mining.
@_date: 2017-12-05 07:29:21
I feel so bad but know first hand the struggles associated with finances 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:36:41
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:06:56
If you have $500 to put in buy $250 now and see how it does, so if it falls you can buy again with the other $250 rather than spending $500 at the high 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:09:45
Just remember hardware (USB) wallets are only to store large amount of cryptocurrency in. If you are looking to invest $500, a $70 wallet may not be worth it 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:20:36
STILL RISING 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:36:15
A family based around bitcoin? Noice
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:22:58
19,200 now 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:10:47
you think the futures will cause a dip?
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:01:55
why is the market crashing?
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:41:33
sell it and put it into litecoin now
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:58:49
Thats far away
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:26:48
Rules are meant to be broken
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:24:59
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:22:34
WTF how
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:38:47
Even if I am smart with my computer? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:42:52
madness? madness. THIS ISSS SPARTAAAAAA!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 05:10:15
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:30:45
lol no its not
@_date: 2017-12-08 07:26:32
Lol nice one 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:34:29
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:32:42
These are btc only wallets though, I would like a wallet that supports many other coins
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:13:10
that would be nice 
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:38:23
Idk someone will step up
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:04:02
sure it can crash but go right back up
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:47:31
I'm not a memer I'm just an announcer 
@_date: 2017-12-09 18:03:43
The scary part is over 
@_date: 2017-12-01 21:28:07
at least 1k
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:18:32
These joyful moments come right along with the holiday season! It's a great time overall! Congrats to everyone!!!
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:44:10
12,149 now
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:33:58
song name? i dont click links on reddit
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:34:16
I would literally eat my left ball sack
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:13:40
Nice congrats
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:28:03
same I expected a dip from 11k to maybe 9.5k but it just shot straight up 
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:08:23
The easies route is to buy currency on coinbase and keep it there, if you want other currencies like ripple, log in to your gdax account using your coinbase login and trade. Coinbase owns gdax, so you are automatically signed up for gdax 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:39:19
Having it in a wallet is different than having it on an exchange
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:28:49
The sooner you plant your feet the better
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:04:49
I think the currency is stored on gdax, if you choose to move it that's your decision. The best wallet is the ledger nano s 
@_date: 2017-12-16 19:23:31
Who tf would even buy that amount
@_date: 2017-12-06 07:02:33
Just bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:59:11
@_date: 2017-12-14 23:39:19
Even if I am smart with my computer? 
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:27:20
Could be a harmful link
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:36:13
Hold off whenever it reaches a high it falls 1k or more then goes right back up 
@_date: 2017-12-13 05:47:33
This looks awesome 
@_date: 2017-12-10 23:24:07
There was a dip yesterday I would wait
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:10:19
DON'T DAY TRADE
@_date: 2019-03-24 02:05:06
nice watch link?
@_date: 2017-08-27 22:01:16
@_date: 2019-10-04 22:18:28
update us when they're all stolen
@_date: 2019-08-16 06:00:49
Its not a loss until you sell
@_date: 2019-06-26 08:59:20
Buy now or regret at 20k
@_date: 2019-10-28 17:09:03
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:27:55
Nice 
@_date: 2019-10-01 21:48:28
with the volatility in bitcoin I think he might age faster
@_date: 2019-10-01 18:41:20
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:29:15
Yes be comfortable with how much you invest
@_date: 2017-11-19 19:10:46
By the end of the year perhaps 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:51:53
I'm ecstatic and eager as well
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:21:10
Same that's what I say
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:54:01
I have verified everything on coinbase already 
@_date: 2017-11-18 07:26:30
Same let's hope for a good outcome 
@_date: 2017-11-17 22:59:19
Do not buy at the highs 
@_date: 2017-11-22 08:42:45
Thanks a lot! Now I can show people what they've missed out on. The site is very user friendly and neat too! 
@_date: 2017-11-13 07:09:02
1 coin! Nice 
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:25:14
I think it will dip a little more to 10k or maybe it wont. But it's better to buy now that to buy at 20k
@_date: 2017-11-14 03:30:45
No but u can start one 
@_date: 2017-11-20 03:11:40
It's falling now but anything below 6k never again 
@_date: 2019-06-26 09:02:26
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:06:25
You can have someone with ID purchase with ur card and send it to ur wallet 
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:49:08
Agree do u think it's a great buy in price 
@_date: 2019-06-29 06:26:21
You loose money on every purchase you make so dont every buy anything?
@_date: 2017-11-14 01:52:23
Wait for another dip 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:55:52
Yes yes I am 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:20:41
Enjoy the rise ;)
@_date: 2017-11-15 07:20:33
How will this happen? 
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:49:43
I mean what's the best way to sell your bitcoin for max profit
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:27:04
There's no problem with buying in tomorrow it can potentially rise to 8k
@_date: 2019-06-24 17:10:30
Could have been up 7k
@_date: 2017-11-13 22:29:22
Why is that necessary 
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:10:39
Remake this but at $8k @_date: 2017-11-13 06:17:23
That would be awesome 
@_date: 2019-12-11 17:54:44
Wallstreetbets rules: no crypto or pump and dumps
@_date: 2017-11-13 18:45:10
What's the best way to sell? Is selling on coinbase good?
@_date: 2019-06-22 07:30:22
Retrace soon to 9k then boom to 12k and onward
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:33:50
There's always a dip that follows the ATH, so buying in at the top is not wise 
@_date: 2017-11-13 19:37:51
Yes it will and the fees are a pain 
@_date: 2019-06-22 06:55:59
Try cashapp
@_date: 2017-11-16 19:24:50
Gr8 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:30:31
10k by end of year for sure 
@_date: 2017-11-19 20:13:46
ur late 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:15:16
Do not buy there will be a dip
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:16:10
SELL SELL SELL
@_date: 2017-11-20 18:54:04
@_date: 2017-11-21 16:18:39
Get lost 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:28:52
But it has surpassed 7k b4
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:41:12
when btc falls, so do the altcoins
@_date: 2017-11-20 05:18:05
Yea that sucks 
@_date: 2017-11-19 22:38:54
The last dip was from &lt;7k down to 5.4k
@_date: 2017-11-12 21:37:13
Hopefully I want to buy this week 
@_date: 2017-11-17 02:43:26
Would be ashame if I can't purchase with bitcoin 
@_date: 2017-11-16 00:14:09
What site is this on I watch on coindesk
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:33:32
I have an account on coinbase but want to mover over to gdax and they ask for info to finish setting up my account but I can't 
@_date: 2017-11-14 15:51:48
No one has that patience 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:14:52
At 8k
@_date: 2019-06-26 18:43:46
It seems like just yesterday we hit 10k. I dont remember 11 or 12 or 13k
@_date: 2019-12-12 17:24:37

Same college here first time buying 
@_date: 2019-06-24 19:07:44
@_date: 2017-11-20 06:29:42
There is an unemployed option but still requires a previous employer 
@_date: 2017-11-24 06:15:55
$200 down is a dip lol 
@_date: 2017-11-15 23:51:24
Why kraken? Can't you sell directly on coinbase?
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:16:30
Did u sell before the fall?
@_date: 2017-11-13 05:22:02
Thought so 
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:51:01

At least u didn't buy at 20K. Just hold forever
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:46:50
Thousands is comprehendible but 5 digit numbers is insane 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:27:56
just sold hoping for a dip soon
@_date: 2017-11-13 06:34:28
I'm sure it won't be too bad buying tomorrow

@_date: 2017-11-13 05:15:45
O ok 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:51:38
If you plan to store more than 1k
@_date: 2017-11-26 23:54:29
But what says it won't stable out and remain at/around a constant price 
@_date: 2019-12-31 17:47:09

@_date: 2017-11-13 07:04:19
Never buy at ATH
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:49:50
coinbase, but if u have a high amount its better to store on a ledger
@_date: 2019-04-11 14:52:17
Very sad and pathetic by the governments involved
@_date: 2019-12-18 04:26:31
thx for the info my account now

@_date: 2018-11-28 03:26:26

@_date: 2018-03-19 00:02:07
No because many people would buy in way before $100
@_date: 2018-03-19 01:07:20
Buying at 10k is very different than buying at 1k
