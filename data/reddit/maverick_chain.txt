Agreed. They are only fdic insured for $ in usd not crypto. Crypto is mostly kept in cold storage from my understanding.
I agree with the service issue and not necessarily needing an account manager but how would you deal with the security issue to verify identity for changes. In legacy banks they can undo but here once a transaction goes out its gone!

Understood. So in your eyes if you have a certain amount with them would you like to see private relationship managers like that of legacy banks? In these types of roles you have a dedicated person to reach out to if you have any issues.

Read 
494784 is the block where the fork will happen

I did read it, terrible grammar but the fork seems like it’s gonna happen. Probably a quick move for people and miners in the 2x futures market. It’s pretty smart to get their money and then ditch it.

We’re the funds in that account. That’s the only time it’s ever cancelled on me because I transferred the money in right after.

 block 494784 I believe is what it says
@_date: 2017-09-13 00:59:27
Probably shorted, released video and now is picking up on the cheap.

I read the same but if I remember correctly wasn't it 20k Worth or transactions in one year? I could be wrong because I can't find the source at the moment.

Yes! Now that's real education right there. I've met Bob Durough multiple times.
