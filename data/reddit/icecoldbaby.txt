@_date: 2016-04-06 07:19:49

@_date: 2016-04-30 01:27:03
how much identity info does it require?
@_date: 2016-03-30 00:56:22
Didnt know that thanks !
@_date: 2016-03-30 00:31:07
Ah i see so it is a lot safer than a private key, so if i lose my wallet then in theory the seed can generate all the addresses used
@_date: 2016-03-30 00:28:55
For point number 2 - lets say i send out some btc to another address then doesnt the 'change' of that transaction come back to my original address and that would mean i still have the remaining coins?
@_date: 2016-03-21 07:04:29
thats great news!
@_date: 2016-06-22 11:50:39
im glad
@_date: 2016-06-22 04:11:06
to store yesterdays transaction data?
@_date: 2016-06-22 00:11:40
Wait so if i understand this correctly a user can now essentially chargeback a transaction that they have sent and keep the bitcoin?? If so this is a terrible outcome
@_date: 2016-06-23 03:16:03
i think in the future we will hit $0 cause aint nobody gon trade there btc for that fiat stuff

No one can tell you when bitcoin is going up or down, the best we can do is speculate. Second bitcoin is very volatile i would not suggest putting money in that you cannot afford to lose.
@_date: 2016-06-23 02:49:58
i wasnt thinking it but now that you mentioned it..
@_date: 2016-06-17 04:33:29
