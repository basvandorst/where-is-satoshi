Like I said in another thread here, a safe trick would be to cash it out immediately or transfer it to your bank ASAP to avoid chargebacks. Like the other commenters here, I do also advise you find a site with an escrow service if you want to get serious about buying and selling for fiat. I would recommend one but it might get this comment silently removed so just direct message me if you're interested.

It seems like Paxful's Ray and Brian did a good job resolving this, despite the crappy support responses. Sure they boast 24/7 customer support but receiving robotic/scripted responses to crucial cases?? ಠ\_ಠ They gotta change if they want to keep users

Not unless you cash it out immediately.

Paxful is pretty good imo. I've used it to find my PayPal account and use Fiat from there (also used PayPal get my BTC, thanks to user marusa01). Other's prices can be pretty steep though because users set their own.

This has to be my favorite crypto meme. I love foxes

I don't mind it, honestly. I've already put too much of my info out on Facebook alone lol

I'm selling bitcoin for paypal, though I dont think paxful is connected to them directly. We just ask people to deposit money in our paypal and once it's confirmed we release the coins. Paxful is just the coin

It seems like Paxful wants to be the first in Venezuela
