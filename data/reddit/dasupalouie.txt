You should give the show a watch. I won't spoil too much but basically what is happening in the current world of cryptocurrencies is what was shown a year ago on the show in the second season.

Regardless, keep your bitcoin in offline storage. I’m more afraid of malware risk than these exploits. These are NSA exploits being closed up.

It’s unstable but it’s real-time. Fiat is not even backed by gold so economists come up with speculative estimates and don’t allow laissez faire economics. This is going the way of the dodo bird now that countries are literally going bankrupt because of governments failing and creating hyperinflation.

It’s like TCP/IP. We’ve been using it for the backbone of the internet and a few key holders control DNS. It’s been used over the decades with few enhancements but it’s solid and still works.

My recommendation, I would sell. Getting rid of debt is more of a relief than gambling and losing it all and staying in debt. We don't have a time machine to know if it will keep going up but it definitely can't sustain this any further. I know everyone on here is a HODL even myself, but you can always start buying back in and rebuild, it's not too late. Also if you do sell declare your taxes, be smart about cashing out.

This bothers me. People laugh at bitcoin now that it's over $9000? Do people forget they were laughing when it was at $300? Regardless of how big of a joke they can make in this skit, it's no longer a joke, it's a big giant change for the world that's moving faster than people think.
@_date: 2017-09-09 18:09:31
Makes me wonder if this is more than just a demand. I'll put my conspiracy hat on and say this is to bad name crypto. This happened with MtGox and silkroad. 
Regardless of what I'm thinking, this shows we need decentralized control of our information and our money. Centralized powers can't guarantee our security.

I was just at the dentist with my wife and some old guy that came in had to pay $5000 for his crowns, I felt so bad for the dude. I totally understand and it's convenient to use BTC, hopefully some of these providers adopt it eventually.

Most of us in this subreddit who bought early know how bitcoin could have helped this gent out. Lots of us realize we're super fortunate with our HODLs but the general public missed out on this rise of BTC.

I live in Canada and the biggest problem I see is money leaving the mainland. Vancouver and Toronto are good examples of where laundered Chinese money is going (i.e. the real estate market) and BTC would make it so much easier for this to happen. The Chinese government has been pressuring the Canadian government to give them details of these immigrants because they're taking all their wealth out of China. Like others said in this thread, China just wants regulations to make sure laundering doesn't happen.

Until every restaurant, gas station and mom and pop shop, etc... takes bitcoin as their main form of currency, we are still early.

For Canada it almost is. This newspaper is Canadian. Toronto's and Vancouver's housing market (mainly flooded with Chinese foreign investors aka money launderers) have been keeping Canada's economy on stilts and the Bank of Canada just hiked the rate twice recently while record number of Canadians (including myself lol) are neck deep in debt. Not sure how people can afford million dollar mortgages on 50k salaries.

Honestly if you’re looking long term don’t even bother looking at the price. It will definitely keep going up past 10k. Heck this past weekend no one saw the spike coming. 2018 will be the year this Phoenix will rise.

ATB is looking into blockchain and welcome bitcoin. I think most people here in this thread needs to realize that if you're conducting business on a personal account or using your credit card with a shitty credit score to buy bitcoin (aka ponzi scheme) you're violating some sort of terms and agreements and they have the right to shut you down. Not all Canadian banks are shutting down buys.

The technology for bitcoin has survived bull runs, whales, hackers, forks, bankers, propaganda, alt coins, governments, everything thrown at it and it's getting better, faster and widespread. The value compared to 5 years ago is still amazing. People have tunnel vision, Rome wasn't built in a day.
