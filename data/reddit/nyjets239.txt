They put a blog out saying those people will be notified. I see more court cases in the future, I doubt this is over with.

It doesn't matter what percentage. Even if it's 1%, they're probably going to be losing 50% or more of that 1%. It may not be significant in terms of their total revenue, but it sure as hell wont help them continue growing their user base.
@_date: 2017-02-18 06:11:34
And they can close any account for any reason. That is for sure.
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:54:20
Just spent $200 with them: 
Fuck eGifter :)

If the price of bitcoin isn't correlated with the amount of energy it takes to mine it then it has no intrinsic value IMO.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:06:07
There is no fee for them to accept Bitcoin, government compliance will be there regardless of this decision.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:11:21
Customers had no reason to complain. The gift cards were available as soon as they transaction was viewable (Not requiring 1 confirmation). Obviously they have a reason, but whatever the reason is it will cost them big money.
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:52:52
Pretty sure that address is attached to your wallet forever, so you should be fine. You likely didn't put a high enough fee considering what has been happening the past week or two.
@_date: 2017-02-18 01:33:02
Probably full of scammers, plus you can't trade over $99 there without getting approved by mods. Screw that.
@_date: 2017-02-19 00:24:05
Here's their response: 
@_date: 2017-02-01 04:47:24
1. You need to be able to withdraw your bitcoin the day your bank deposit clears. If you submit a new deposit within the time frame it takes for the original one to clear you are not able to withdraw the original BTC until the second one clears? It's stupid as hell considering we can only buy $500 a day.
2. Instant ACH should actually be Instant ACH. Where we buy it using ACH and we instantly get the bitcoin like Coinbase had. Of course you would only offer this to customers who had a long history with you, but it should be offered.
3. Make it easier to raise $500 limit. I've bought for a few straight weeks $500 every day and I still am not able to get an increase.
@_date: 2017-02-17 19:44:06
Sad day for bitcoin, the whole point of using bitcoin is decentralization. Then idiots like eGifter centralize it to one company. Will have to find a new site to buy my gift cards from I guess.
@_date: 2017-02-27 21:36:17
You have the Mt. Gox hackers who have 850,000 bitcoin which is worth roughly $1 billion now so...
@_date: 2017-02-18 20:38:58
This isn't remotely true. A large portion of states do not allow open carry, and in some cities it is nearly impossible to have a gun on you if you are not on your property.
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:24:40
All of mine were given to me instantly after I sent the payment.
@_date: 2017-02-17 22:50:36
Hit them where it hurts: 
Spend with their rival who actually supports bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:17:20
Email them back with your displeasure and say you will be taking your money elsewhere. The only way they will revert this change is if you hit them where it hurts, their wallet.

Always gotta be black people. Smh.
@_date: 2017-02-17 23:53:31
Then you must consider the power it takes to generate legal tender. If you give bitcoin an intrinsic value so does all fiat because it requires labor to create since it's physical.
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:09:04
Got it. Still a bad decision. A majority of their Bitcoin userbase is either A. Not eligible for a Coinbase account or B. Not willing to have all of their information snooped at by the government. I hope they lose a lot of money. Whatever they will make up by switching to exclusively Coinbase will be lost 10 fold by the amount of customers they lose who generate profit for them. 
@_date: 2017-02-17 20:04:43
People I know who use Coinbase experience even higher delays than myself (Electrum) because Coinbase chooses the mining fee, they have no say over how high or low the fee can be. And the fee that Coinbase is using currently is very low priority.
@_date: 2017-02-21 17:37:17
Meh, it might have something to do with my account history with them. For accounts with no previous orders I wouldn't doubt they would have to wait for a confirmation. Fear no more though, I will have no future history with them until they revert their policy :)
@_date: 2017-03-11 12:33:46
Less than 3 weeks after making the decision they felt their wallets hurt and reversed. Refer to previous thread for more info: 
@_date: 2017-02-13 20:16:06
Not safe at all. Login to PayPal with VPN, pay the person, accept btc, login under real ip, report unauthorized. Profit.

We would need to all contribute approximately 5530.85 BTC ($5,000,000) in order to get a 30 second commercial during the Superbowl. Goodluck with that crowdfunding effort.
@_date: 2017-01-12 00:00:30
You can't compare Coinbase to Gemini. They're 2 different species. Coinbase is an exchange meant for consumers to buy bitcoin for retail purposes, whereas Gemini is more geared towards investment type people. If you want a true comparison, compare GDAX (Coinbase's Equivalent) and Gemini. They have relatively similar fees.
@_date: 2017-01-07 05:10:15
Or they have a pretty small user base.
@_date: 2017-08-05 05:54:52
You sure the game isn't coming to a close soon?
@_date: 2017-08-05 06:00:19
It's going to be the same thing as eth classic.
Give it another week and bcc will probably drop another $100 from people being able to deposit and dump.
Then it will stabilize and be bitcoins little brother.
@_date: 2017-08-13 22:42:57
localbitcoins should do it for you.
@_date: 2017-01-16 02:51:56
Is it a good idea? No. The chances that you will lose a good amount of money are definitely there since Bitcoin is one of the most volatile currencies in the world. If you have no income and can't pay your dad back $2-$3k that you might potentially lose it's a bad idea. If you have a job and are willing to work to just have it paid back then it's probably a good idea. I don't think he really expects you to pay him back though so good move.
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:50:41
Yep I have a $10,000 limit on coinbase but when they removed instant bank I said fuck this I'm out. The only way to get instant from them is to pay their ridiculous fee for debit card. With circle the fee is at least reasonable (1% or so compared to like 4%).
@_date: 2016-11-21 05:17:08
It is the same as coinbases if you're using your bank from coinbase. However since I now have to use a debit card on coinbase to get instant which is near 4% it's a total scam.
@_date: 2016-11-21 03:39:09
8 weeks of maxing out limit though?
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:54:26
Yea they should put an asterisk mark when they say free. The price you're buying at is 1% over the actual value of bitcoin. So if you buy $750 of what circle determines the value is you're really only getting like $742.50 in every other exchange. Also, you have instant using your bank account on Coinbase?
@_date: 2016-12-01 16:21:09
 will be switching to electrum wallet and finding a new way to buy my bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-11-21 04:50:54
Why do you say that?
@_date: 2016-11-21 01:55:06
I contacted them a few weeks back and they said when their automatic system determines I'm due for an increase it will automatically increase it.
@_date: 2016-11-21 02:55:38
Yeah but I'm not most new users. I am maxing out every week.
@_date: 2017-11-30 22:51:19
If they would use a cloud computing service they wouldn't have this problem :)
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:27:33
You'd never be able to visit the United States ever again. They wont give you a visa or allow you to travel visa free.
@_date: 2017-11-30 10:42:43
So you do need quick transactions for online sales in some cases.
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:32:30
They have services that deliver within an hour or two.
@_date: 2017-11-17 04:02:33
No I bought a large sum a few months ago and they do not reimburse you.
@_date: 2017-09-30 20:58:44
I want to invest in different ways of implementing blockchain technology. So I like bitcoin, IOTA, etc.
@_date: 2017-09-30 17:11:40
Never put all of your eggs in one basket, especially so for cryptocurrency.
@_date: 2017-10-14 06:18:08
Something something illegal.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:16:52
You can send any transaction for 10 cents or less if you wanted next block confirmation. If you don't care you can send for like .005 cents and it'll confirm in a few hours. Has nothing to do with lightning really, more that the craze has died down and the mempool isn't being spammed.
@_date: 2018-07-25 21:25:55
Then the fees would go up if you wanted confirmation in a reasonable amount of time.
@_date: 2017-10-19 21:47:17
$6,000 by mid 2018 ya right more like $6,000 by the end of this damn month.
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:32:02
How often are you sending $10,000 abroad? .00001% of all transactions on this planet
@_date: 2016-10-05 00:01:21
Well circle generally has a higher price that you have to buy the bitcoin ($3 per btc atm) than what it actually goes for, so they still make their money that way. But the price difference isn't even close to 3.99%. Anyways I just need to get my limits increased on circle now so I can transition. Fuck coinbase.
@_date: 2016-10-29 05:56:32
An hour and 20 minutes to confirm a transaction. A lot of people wait for a confirmation before giving you your goods.
@_date: 2016-10-29 06:01:54
Credit cards? Instant. Cash? Instant. If you want to strictly use bitcoin for bank transfers then sure, but that is a small minority of overall payments.
@_date: 2017-05-01 14:12:42
Just take them to small claims court. The good thing about Coinbase is that they are based in the U.S., so it's easy to sue them. The other good thing is that they will bend over backwards to be legal, so you'll get your money.
@_date: 2017-07-30 04:32:00
Obviously it's not anonymous if you're giving them your shipping details. But having to give a 3rd party your details as well is ridiculous.
@_date: 2017-05-15 22:47:54
Civil != Jail
@_date: 2017-05-10 14:47:38
I guess this is the resolution the IRS and Coinbase came to in order to solve their fiasco? It's basically the same thing that PayPal is required to do (200 transactions AND $20,000 worth).
@_date: 2017-07-30 03:59:08
There's no problem with them requiring you to hand over all of your personal information to a 3rd party exchange in order to receive a refund? Must not be too educated on the whole idea of bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-07-11 23:00:49
??? Go look at the cuts GOP proposes to IRS
@_date: 2017-07-17 18:26:34
I just created an excel spreadsheet with all of my coins that I hold, and it automatically updates every minute the price from coinmarketcap.com so I get my value.
@_date: 2017-07-10 23:06:50
GOP is doing the latter.
@_date: 2017-07-20 05:08:21
Well technically yes, realistically no.
@_date: 2017-06-06 03:19:13
Why the fuck does it put bitcoin: When you copy your receive address to clipboard? That's annoying as fuck.
@_date: 2017-06-25 04:25:28
Does 80% of the population keep their life savings in cash in their wallet? Youre not answering the question.
