and from that point on Dan larimer/Bytemaster has been hell bent on creating alternative coins to Bitcoin and alternatives to proof of work...  Go figure.. Worked out great right?  EOS  "ecaf" wanna be court system where they take people's money, create black lists, threaten to sue any other "block producer" that doesn't cooperate with the black lists.
(LOL @ Delegated proof of stake, great... it's proof of stake but you limit how many people can participate! Genius!)

yes everyone would prefer Bitrefill doing it,  lol. bitflash is not going to like reading this thread

I think it's pretty cool.
e.g.  2 input 2 output **1.37** transaction fee...
e.g. 2 in 100 out = **18 cents** per transaction (a [bitflash.club]( batched transaction)
It aggregates multiple lightning transactions into one onchain transaction with multiple outputs
I wonder if there's a way to reduce the counter party risk and provide the same service?
P.S. Exchanges could do this rather well because they make the largest batched transactions. Except for Coinbase which is the only exchange still not batching...
I'd like it when **bitrefill** does this because it'd be KYC free and I trust their lightning skillz more then bitflash.club

I'm kinda shocked that people would hang off a bridge, risk their life, to scribble some crap on it for free
Find this guy or his gang and tell them to "paint" all the bridges with the word "Bitcoin" and pay him in bitcoin.
(It's prophetic... one of the busiest freeways in the country during a bull run)

only certain coins/tokens/icos are blocks from US users. The stuff that could be considered a security by the SEC would be blocked from US users., You can still use the US version binance.
Bitcoin trading would still be available to US users.    Everything else is actually a scam so whatever. Not a fan of the SEC but... not a fan of shit coins, tokens, ICO's, IEO's either. I am personally kind of happy about it.

I had my little fill of McAfee, reading his twitter and watching him on youtube.
Here's what I learned...
1) He shoots fish with a machine gun. He calls that fishing.
2) He's the one that publicly told the world how long he's got away without paying taxes, then the IRS went after him. 
3) He's been preparing for a gun fight his entire life. He says he sits on the toilet holding a gun.
4) He's 73 years old and dying in a shoot out with the government is probably his biggest dream come true and he's worried he's going to die before he can make it happen.

Let Bitmain die and check out the T3 miner 
@_date: 2018-11-23 23:09:54
One reason for a short term hash drop too is that new miners are shipping at the end of the year that are double the power efficiency. I would be trying to sell my soon to be absolute miners ASAP before they're almost worthless

This is basically what Andreas Antonopoulos said a long time ago in one of his videos and I'm sure "Roman" watched it

it's kind of a good thing that the ability to hack crypto currency is not decentralized because it would mean it's easy
would you like it if "Most crypto currency hacks carried out by different, unique, first time hackers"

Andreas is a good educator and communicator. I listen to all podcast and watch all videos from everyone, but what I notice is that if I listen to all of Andreas's material I get tidbits of information that I don't get anywhere else or from anyone else. Therefor my ears and mind is never as open then when I'm listening to Andreas

I'm reading a comment about Grin being a poor store of value without any explanation why. 
The only explanation could be it's inflation properties, so what are they?

If you put 50 miners on your flat rate billed power, you will not have flat rate power for much longer
