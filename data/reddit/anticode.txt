Must have been an early adopter of the Bitbrain ICO.

Thanks. That vaguely psychotic behavior would be worth utter psychopathy today. 
Glad you didn't diagnose it.

The math is already there.
I think what people are talking about is that quantum encryption techniques are unlikely to be applied retroactively to a bunch of stuff, especially the things that have already been sniffed up.
You can apply QE as soon as you can use QC to crack old encryption, no problem - But any snapshots are going to be wide open for casual analysis.
Of course, this implies that if any citizens started their own decentralized "NSA" program immediately, focusing on encrypted transmissions the playing field would be even during the onset of quantum computing. 
In fact... Gov spying is mostly insidious when used as a weapon to target individuals. But the civilian version of the database would be used to de-cloak high value conspiracies and corruption. The government would definitely be the one on the bad side here.
The disrobing of thousands of Joe-Schmo hackers or political enemies would be insignificant compared to the vast amount of govt secrets that would become visible.

They're just the typical capitalist success story. In this case, most of their customers do not view them badly yet (as Walmart is), but lets just say I've heard some bad stories about how they treat their internal low-level employees.

Judging by the moderation log it looks like he was banned over a PM? I guess he got in an argument with a mod in private since the mute reason is a link to a message.

This wording is to describe a result of the test. 
They're saying that they ran a test (a good one or bad depending on how confident you are with the SSL issue) and *found* that SSL was present.
Without a test they'd just be saying, "Uh... well, it's *supposed* to be there, right? We coded it. Hey, George! Did you forget the SSL again? No? Yeah. It's savvy."
They're not saying, "Oh, whaddaya know... it *does* have SSL enabled."
If you want to really make them look silly then you'll want to replicate your issue and give them the steps to do so, because right now they did a test which shows that you're mistaken.

I see. Thanks

The headline reads like it's from The Onion.
"British Petrol warns not to use electric cars as they are not backed by the petroleum industry!"

Sure, I can't fill a swimming pool full of crypto and take a swim, but if someone wants to give me goods, services, or fiat in exchange for them then I assure you that they are most certainly real.
I'd also like to add that since the USD isn't backed by any actual commodity (like gold) that *it* isn't real either... 
The fundamental difference between crypto and digitally represented USD (banks, credit, stock, etc...) is that when you change a few ones and zeros in a blockchain **everyone knows**.
