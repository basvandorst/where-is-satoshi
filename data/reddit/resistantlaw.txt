Not sure what it is that Coinbase changed but in the past I’m pretty sure it has always said that your credit card company may charge it as a cash advance. I always use debit.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:31:19
Well the biggest wallet is an exchange, so you have to consider that. Most of the top wallets are exchanges.
@_date: 2018-01-26 20:36:20
This is not news, certain credit card companies always charged them as cash advances.
@_date: 2018-01-15 15:33:45
Would be nice if they just had a giant button saying bitcoin, and a little one saying bitcoin cash. 
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:40:09
No, Walmart has a marketplace where other sellers can list items. It has been around for quite a while. That's why you can find something on Walmart.com and not necessarily in the store.
When searching to see if Walmart has an item, I always choose 'only from Walmart.com' or whatever the option is that doesn't include the other sellers.

When do you pay 1% to coinbase? Are you saying when you sell your btc?
Im not sure what gdax fee is for selling, but it’s definitely lower than coinbase. I would just transfer your btc to gdax(or to coinbase then gdax, either should give the same exact amount of btc).
Coinbase is geared more towards newer/unfamiliar users, and gdax is for traders. I still use coinbase though since it has instant buy through debit card.
@_date: 2017-12-02 07:36:34
Yeah they said on twitter to stop asking them to change it, it's not the official name for the coin.
@_date: 2017-12-16 18:49:55
Since you are saying that you're a noob, here's a tip. If you need to send bitcoin somewhere else (rather than just buying it and selling it on coinbase), go on to gdax.com which is the trading site for Coinbase. You can login there and click "transfer money from coinbase account" and transfer your btc there for free. Then you can withdraw your money from gdax and there is no transaction fee. 
Because if you just had withdrawn from Coinbase, it would probably do a $12 transaction fee or something crazy.
@_date: 2014-07-09 19:02:05
Coinbase I presume? I have the same problem. I really wish it was faster. You can make coinbase an instant buy, but it requires a Visa credit card. All I have are mastercards :(
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:51:25
Man, I remember when I first found btc and nobody had them. They were $6 first time I saw them. I had no use, but when I found them going to hundreds, and over $1000 for about 5 seconds, I was like damn what if I bought like 50 btc back then. 
But that's just how it goes, you never know where the price will change to.
@_date: 2014-12-29 00:30:52
This is interesting, I am glad they showed that to get the word out. I've known about bitcoin for years but it's pretty surprising how many people still have never heard of it. When I heard someone say "Bitcoin Bowl" I had to stop and ask them what it was called again. Never thought this would happen.
But people are still really misinformed. When they told me it was Bitcoin Bowl, they said "Yeah Bitcoin is sponsoring it" and I had to explain that "bitcoin" can't sponsor it because "bitcoin" isn't a person or company, it is just bitcoin. There are companies who deal with bitcoin, and my first thought was BitPay or such(which it was BitPay) so yeah people need to know what it is all about.
If there was a Superbowl ad, that would be crazy, attract a lot of attention. If we find that they are going to play an ad, I would buy a bunch before that happens cause I am sure it will spike up lol.
@_date: 2014-06-12 17:59:46
I was about to post this! I like this website, I use it to learn iPhone development and it is very well put together.
@_date: 2014-11-03 16:37:21
Yeah, I looked at it and was like "wtf, why do I only have $249.80 now?"
Someday I'll use my brain, someday...
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:30:28
I'm pretty sure Bitcoin keeps getting bigger and bigger. More merchants are accepting it every day and it has functioned fine in economy at high amounts and low amounts. Just because it dropped this week, doesn't mean it will stay that way forever.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:31:16
I think I am gonna go ahead and buy another one, then I just hope that it goes up. If not 1.0 then maybe 0.5, depends how much I have in my bank account.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:47:14
I was too late a year ago. I think it's not worth it.
@_date: 2014-08-18 23:53:27
Holy shit that is cool. I like that, it will be interesting to see what happens.
@_date: 2017-02-17 16:38:07
Yeah but nobody actually says that. I mean, the only time I've encountered the word satoshi is on one of those websites that give out free satoshis.
But yeah, maybe in the future it will be more relevant.
@_date: 2014-07-11 15:42:44
"We know you love CoinJar" shutup I don't even know what this website is!
@_date: 2017-02-09 00:55:34
Wait you didn't know new video games retail at $60? It's been that way for quite a few years. Since the xbox 360/ps3 were out.
Tons of people would buy 4 games a month at $12 lol. That's why people buy indie titles, much cheaper.
@_date: 2017-02-17 06:41:06
Yeah but in the end we are just saying "hey you owe me 0.0000000231 btc" or whatever the case may be.
@_date: 2017-02-09 02:52:39
What? When do bitcoins just disappear?
And if it's enough to keep people away, why is it being used then??
@_date: 2014-08-19 00:12:49
As long as I buy when it is low, I will get it at that price. I needed some to make some purchases, and of course there was no way to know it was gonna drop this much.
I can't link my credit card because all I have is mastercard and they require visa.
@_date: 2017-03-03 20:18:20
It's a much smaller fee and people claim to have used it successfully. And they have a nice website.
It's not surprising that they can scam many people. We just have to spread awareness.
Don't use Changelly either.
@_date: 2017-02-09 01:38:02
Are you saying that one day, satoshis may be relevant?
@_date: 2017-03-10 22:13:41
lol just wait till tomorrow and see where we are at
@_date: 2017-03-04 00:16:58
The post I've seen usually go "I've used it a couple times with no trouble but this time I didn't get anything"
@_date: 2017-08-22 02:42:02
I thought we all hated bitpay now
@_date: 2017-08-29 12:52:05
Bitcoin fees or hospital fees?
@_date: 2017-11-06 17:44:34
I’m just saying, it’s not like only 2 coins will rise. Other coins will go up a lot probably 
@_date: 2017-11-09 00:03:58
In my opinion, calling off Segwit2x should make the price surge even higher
@_date: 2017-11-19 15:50:53
This is decent, better than the $12 fee coinbase was coming up with. The problem here is that people spending regular dollars on their debit card or whatever, they don’t ever think about transaction fees. The stores they use will pay those fees to visa or whoever. With bitcoin, we are paying the transaction fee, so if we want it to be worthwhile of coffee purchases or whatever, it definitely needs to be a few cents at most. Hope core can figure that out.
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:38:39
1500 is still a pretty high price. Look at where Bitcoin Cash is at.
@_date: 2017-11-14 14:34:21
Dude I only use coinbase because of how quick it is, but god damn they calculated a $12 transaction fee to send btc (not even their buying fees, just network fee).
part of me feels like the fee is actually only 1/4 of that and they are keeping the other 3/4.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:54:38
Calm down dude
@_date: 2017-11-19 18:45:44
It’s $8000+
@_date: 2017-11-06 15:39:20
or one of the other 1000 altcoins....
@_date: 2017-11-14 20:20:29
Only reason I haven’t used gdax is cause theres no way to instantly buy, pretty sure you gotta wait a few days for bank transfer.
@_date: 2017-11-14 23:37:45
It was a joke, I can definitely go look but I don’t really care enough to.
I don’t know what you’re so upset about.
@_date: 2017-11-14 21:55:24
If I instant buy then I’ve already bought the btc, what do you mean?
Edit: wait do you mean sending to another wallet from gdax will give me a much lower fee? If that’s the case then damn I wish I figured that out long long ago!
@_date: 2017-04-05 20:37:18
Since when?
@_date: 2017-04-13 14:09:09
But if everyone is using btc then it would all be based on that new price. So if that value is 250x the amount a normal person had, they would still have 250x as much money when the price changes.
@_date: 2018-02-13 05:29:21
Why is this joke getting so many upvotes?
I mean, I'm all aboard for the joke but at this point it is overdone.
I'm assuming the upvotes has to deal with the title though. I wonder if this will have a realistic impact on the market.
@_date: 2017-09-07 02:33:50
Wouldn't they kinda just be robbing themselves? How do they benefit from it? It's a miner fee.
@_date: 2017-09-28 21:42:40
Scam sites redirect you to real site and say you put the wrong info in. Then you just say "oh must have mistyped" and you login as normal. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:37:47
Kraken was the issue, so any app or service that pulled kraken price was doing it.
@_date: 2017-10-27 19:57:55
That’s such a small amount that it doesn’t even exist in bitcoin
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:37:05
Something with kraken api
@_date: 2017-10-26 20:56:57
Surely it is part of the reason?
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:42:34
Not sure how electrum works but a lot of people were posting pics from Blockfolio and on there you can choose which exchange you want for every coin. 
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:35:32
This is really cool, imagine a crypto city where it is all crypto based. Crypto companies, crypto payments, etc, and all the huge buildings would be like in this graphic.
I would definitely love to see it. I think it could actually be reality one day (maybe in another country, idk if US would allow something like that).
Would you move there if something like that existed?
@_date: 2017-10-09 14:09:27
I’m still waiting for Coinbase..... ��
@_date: 2017-10-21 16:37:35
Kraken was the issue, so any app or service that pulled kraken price was doing it.
@_date: 2017-10-21 17:05:26
Idk, cryptopia? Lol
@_date: 2017-10-09 20:18:25
By the end of the year? I don’t have any doubts about eventually getting to those prices, but I think that saying end of the year is quite far fetched.
I would love to be proved wrong though ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 23:33:28
But why does the candle go all the way down to 0? Was someone really selling btc for a few dollars?
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:41:29
To be fair, I have had 0 issues with coinbase. Except that the app kept telling me Coinbase was unavailable, so I went on the computer and was able to sell my btc.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:46:47
Instead of USDT being around $0.95 each, like it was recently, it's now like $1.2 each. I know it doesn't make sense, but that's where we are at. USDT was supposed to be a 1:1 thing so that you didn't have to deal with in and out of a bank or whatever, you could just transfer to USDT and your money was safe. 
@_date: 2017-05-26 01:03:25
I guess that makes more sense. Definitely is only when choosing gdax, but I figured that one would be more correct than most of the other choices.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:37:15
I work overnight. I saw 2700. I thought, I can go to bed and it will probably not have gone down yet. It could hit $3000. Wake up to this lol.
Oh well I lost $100 off of what I was selling.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:39:45
That's cool but you shoulda waited for the price to crash lol.
@_date: 2017-05-25 17:45:05
I figured it originated with something like that, but I never saw the actual post. Thanks for sharing. Pretty funny how everyone just instantly went with it, and now it is a thing that pretty much everyone uses.
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:21:02
I just sent to Coinbase a little while ago. It confirmed but the coins were then sent somewhere else, and I didn't see it in my account until the second part confirmed. Just wait a bit, assuming you sent it to the right place, it should show up as pending transaction soon :) 
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:19:14
This has to crash soon, right?
@_date: 2017-05-25 06:47:10
You're right but the big jump in the past couple days was definitely because of that.
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:32:35
I don't get it, where does this say "not Craig wright"?
@_date: 2017-05-13 17:18:39
Do people know the addresses with his coins? If he sold or whatever, would people know basically right away?
@_date: 2017-07-02 20:50:51
See, that's the problem. Even if the company is directly handling the btc, they usually convert it to fiat. Or at least most of it. I mean I get it, you need those real dollars. But what's the point if everyone who accepts it just changes it to usd?
I guess it's just one step at a time.
@_date: 2017-07-18 07:07:00
So is BIP91 the good one or bad one? .....
@_date: 2017-07-28 21:10:50
Wait, no. I don't think anyone answered your question. If you deposit to bittrex AFTER the fork, you're not going to magically get 2 different coins. The only time you will get both coins is at the time of the split. 
@_date: 2017-05-17 05:21:44
Big thing that I don't think anyone mentioned. Just read a post a little bit ago about how reddit changed the way it shows users online. It used to only count logged in people but now it counts anyone whether they are logged in or not.
@_date: 2017-07-08 15:23:03
I think it would take a lot for bitcoin to just stop being used. It's the only crypto that is widely accepted and nothing has come close to it. And if the price dropped significantly people would be there to buy it all up.
Anything could happen, this all is still very new, but with all the scams and stuff I find it hard to trust any coin that isn't bitcoin. There's a reason people are bitcoin maximalists.
Edit: oh and every other crypto is valued in btc so there's that
@_date: 2017-05-27 07:09:34
of all the coins?
@_date: 2017-07-06 23:53:14
Yeah apparently this is common. I mean if you are coming from stocks, it makes sense I guess. This is the first thing I have ever invested in like this, so it also surprised me at first that people didn't know this
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:06:45
It did not shoot past 2900 and on most websites it hasn't event reached 2900 yet
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:25:41
You would do it manually but it pulls the price info from whatever exchange you choose 
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:05:47
I think it might say if you are on the desktop site? It's kinda annoying, the app gives less details. 
Anyways, get the Blockfolio app, it's really nice. You can put every transaction and how much you bought and the price at the time and it will tell your profits loss and it works for pretty much any coin.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:54:05
Wanna know how I kept my portfolio at the same value it was a week ago? I bought more coins :P
Okay obviously I had to put more funds into crypto, but seriously I bought more coins in this dip! You should too while there is still time! The market keeps increasing over the long run.
But make your own decisions, and invest in half decent coins at the very least.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:56:08
See thats the thing. When the hell am I allowed to sell? As far as I know I spent money and will never get it back.
I mean obviously it is up to me for when to sell, but I can't say I'm rich from this if I never actually receive any of these gains. Any time there are gains I just put it right back into crypto lol.
@_date: 2017-06-27 23:05:28
I have no idea what a posteo is lol I figured it was some obscure email provider that nobody used.
@_date: 2017-06-27 21:59:52
We are talking $300 per computer, it could be a lot of money for big companies.
One of the other comments someone mentions a company that had 200,000 computers affected, that's $60 million.
@_date: 2017-06-06 07:52:57
Why, cause it stayed at that price for an hour?
Take a break from the charts man, I know it's addicting. 
@_date: 2017-06-27 22:03:32
Funny thing is I read elsewhere that the email provider they used, posteo, terminated their address. So that means people can send the money but they can't ever actually unlock the files lol.
Anyways, I think these criminals are smart enough that they would use different btc addresses, right? I'm sure that isn't everything they received.
