that would be good if 70's banking technology was replaced.
Yeah. Maybe I, too optimisitic about the recovery.. just to the average white US/UK person, it appears to have recovered.

I hear you.... I think though in my hometown there are probably more than 350 retailers that accept nfc payments...

Interesting. 
But if they are using some off-exchange transfer they have to sell the BTC in bulk and thus at a discount, which counteracts the "Live" market price that they offering merchants, right? And they lose out?
So they HAVE to have a Bitcoin long strategy as a business?

edit: there's actually six videos:
1. A sexy vampire woman will dance as she explains Hierarchical Deterministic  Bitcoin wallets using flashcards
2. A 5 year old boy and his younger brother will explain why the debt backed dollar is likely to collapse and Bitcoin reign with the help of their Lego bricks
3. A Weirdo in Las Vegas will sing how Bitcoin will soon be used for shopping and gambling… But will caution that with this adoption comes the likelihood of dilution of the core libertarian values
4. A guy in a loincloth in the jungle, will do a promotional video for his monkey (or other jungle item) that he is willing to sell for Bitcoins and how he can offer a discount to international buyers due to the low international transction fees
5. A robot puppet will rant about how Bitcoin  mining has got much much much harder
6. A Bitcoin bellydancer will about sing the Bitcoin Blockchain

That makes sense: watch the transaction volume.. I WILL - thats the key to take up.

Omm, they are not my companies. My point is, the majority of the issues that bitcoin proposes to solve, are being solved by other means.

also, doesn't Robert Peston what with working for the BBC, have to disclose any Bitcoin holdings that he has?
@_date: 2014-12-23 10:56:12
nope. I cant! :)

off exchange liquidity brokers? Dark pools, oooh sounds exciting. I guess then Bitpay don't directly effect the exchange market price.. So someone somewhere else either continues amassing bitcoins or does the dirty work of disposing?
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:27:12
I guess what with overstock, fiverr, and the rest of them, it makes sense.

I do want to think bigger.  I love the idea of the evolution of trade between humans.
I have a question about the transaction volume and how to spot the "real" transactions, what with the trader bots popping-in-out and remixers mixing up through multiple transactions..
@_date: 2014-12-23 11:25:32
fair enough.. ;)
@_date: 2014-02-12 10:45:32
Yes, Mo, too should get in on the action. And I guess all the other messengers from god for all the other faiths

For bitcoin to survive it has to be more than this. with regards to remittance, mechanism of exchange, unit of value, store of value, adoption by the masses ?

Do people mind paying fees if they are a fraction of what was previously, where the fee becomes so low its near insignificant? I think its something like on a £2000 transfer the fee has gone from £55 to £3.

that's a mighty goal. 
Isn't there something M-pesa in africa?. Can in the foreseable future it help families that cant get a bank account and have nowhere that accepts bitcoin (should they aquire some)?

ah thanks, hmm.. not sure I have 3.3 decillion years thou

Thanks for sharing this. My Google Translate was just printing nonsense: 
@_date: 2013-12-23 18:16:09
I just wondered if Bitcoin would survive and be of any use in a Zombie Apocalypse alongside a crossbow and some tins in the cellar?

I've met David Woo. Seemed like a nice guy.
Oh, no I didn't, I've getting confused with Danny Woo:
"The Danny Woo International District Community Garden is a community garden on the outskirts of the International District, Seattle, Washington"
