man hopefully not below 8500, that's when i have to sell..
@_date: 2018-01-07 07:41:49
you can travel to the future just not the past 
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:21:00
can someone translate what this guy just said
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:31:32
rather than being a time traveler...It's actually infinitely times more likely that you're either 1.trolling
2. have bad memory about that phone call or the accuracy of what was discussed
3. you actually did write btc - 300k or less but the guy spelled something else and you were zoned out
4.going insane as well as your wife
5. it actually DID happen but the guy asking you mistakenly said Bitcoin instead of something else
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:42:39
i dont think you understand the difference between normal price swings and an actual bubble..
@_date: 2018-01-08 06:35:09
are you really comparing time traveling to financial systems LOL
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:19:57
"It's nice knowing some people are spending today taking losses" You're also taking losses fyi
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:41:34
Honestly all those questions apply to BTC as well LOL
@_date: 2018-01-06 03:53:04
40 cents per person :0
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:00:42
lol are you being a sarcastic dumbfuck or a serious one? yes because owning and using BTC should be limited to traders only looking to make a profit or those who understand trading terminology. That's totally what satoshi created BTC for.. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 01:07:01
bruh he's talking about the rich who have both BTC and contracts
@_date: 2018-01-12 01:16:11
actually, I and 99.99999 percent of physicists agree that travelling to the future is a fact and happens "all the time" in the universe.. It happens with many kinds of matter and possibly intelligent beings or artifacts made by them...Likewise, most of them think travelling to the past is impossible... 
"You shouldn't be thinking about the models we make of the universe as laws." --- The word law has a broad meaning. A large body of facts of science are called Laws by scientists themselves so why shouldn't I? It wasn't my decision to name it LOL I suggest you actually read about what laws of science mean, and why they're called laws. 
@_date: 2018-01-21 18:07:20
 first thing i bought using bitcoin is USD

"if you're traveling abroad, you can "transfer" money from your home bank account to an account in your current country without paying these fees. ... In both cases, you'll simply need to visit a local bank branch or ATM and use your home bank's debit card to withdraw cash from your overseas account." 
@_date: 2018-01-17 05:11:56
yes well it's mostly the people who bought more than they can lose above 10k LOL
@_date: 2018-01-18 05:40:10
What crypto ban??!
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:45:19
k if you have only a few hundred or 1k to lose then sure hodl.. If you have tens of thousands, sell, keeps some profit at least and dont lose your initial investment
@_date: 2018-01-31 02:19:13
Gladly! I'll sell and make a profit while you keep buying until it hits pre tether prices again
@_date: 2018-01-06 02:21:57

@_date: 2018-01-06 02:35:09
it means OP is making fun of chart analysts who name a previous set of candles because of their shape and so if a similar pattern occurs in the future they assume it will follow the same path, which is bs
@_date: 2018-01-17 00:15:39
what the hell did you just say?
@_date: 2018-01-09 04:33:17
inventing blockchain doesn't violate the laws of physics hahah seriously, get over the fact traveling to the past impossible.. how about instead you ponder how amazing relativity is and the possibility of future time travel, k?
@_date: 2018-01-17 04:42:25
"faster, cheaper, and more secure" look I like bitcoin and all but *facepalm* at this statement .. faster than buying a coffee? Nope. Cheaper than buying a coffee? Nope? More secure? Nope, you can lose your btc keys as easily as cash

Hello MountBlanc, "telling the truth and this thing really happened" is already assumed by numbers 2, 3. and 5. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 03:02:17
it's about to on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:33:28
my point is they do when they have to, 
@_date: 2017-12-01 00:45:47
nah most who have bought bitcoins or mined them back in 2009-2011 would surely have been reminded already or kept up to date w/ it..
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:36:59
no you shouldn't. The guy who said that is not the cofounder of bitcoin the technology.. Only reason he said that is because he's salty that things aren't being developed the way he wants it to be.. 
@_date: 2017-12-06 04:25:17
how i feel when bought at 9k 8)
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:54:58
If all you want is a very small investment for very small profits in a few weeks then no, bitcoin is not the right investment... 
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:30:02
can't believe you sodl
@_date: 2017-12-22 05:50:01
i bet 10k tomorrow
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:03:44
no you have to wait for that
@_date: 2017-12-10 18:29:08
yes essentially you're just buying the coins from other people who are selling on their site
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:08:04
You gave them thousands of dollars each of legitimate money and they laughed at you? You didn't bother showing them how to cash out? How are they your friends? Were you a millionaire already in uni? I think you're lying actually.
@_date: 2017-12-01 05:40:49
LMAO A meme to mock them or praise them? because ETH is definitely THEE ONE to invest in..
@_date: 2017-12-21 03:24:46
they do not charge higher on coinbase than from gdax.. Btc orders on coinbase are bought and come directly from traders on gdax
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:03:41
I assume the price would correct rather quickly either way as more people are starting to invest and are comfortable buying in at say like 7k since it's gone up so much, also they can do the reverse of this and raise the price after
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:27:13
You must be new to cryptocurrency because wall street is heavily invested into Bitcoin, so why would their ultimate goal be to take it down.. 
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:58:48
how much was the tip?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:39:10
That's different than "shorting to 0 out of pure spite" or trying to destroy it completely as OP is suggesting.
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:30:57
NO. Not for the people who invested a lot.
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:26:29
so why is showing your I.D irrelevant to you? And if you have some money or btc in your account, you won't be able to withdraw unless you're verified
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:38:11
lol at ppl not realizing this rise is because of market manipulation
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:38:19
All they would be doing is betting if the price is going to go up in the future or down in the future. So I'm not sure what you mean by "betting against" it.. Also, huge institutional investors have been putting money, hundreds of millions, into bitcoin for many years now, this isn't really new to them...
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:29:41
how much?
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:18:44
wow.. how do you resist selling at 16-17k... Easy 60 percent profit and then buy more in the dip
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:09:11
He just might be the first trillionaire as well! 
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:38:38
if the price keeps going "down and down and down" there will be people buying those prices knowing they will go up anyway
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:59:42
Most of the people who are saying BTC is fake or a bubble DON'T even own bitcoin so your challenge is pointless.. 
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:14:30
it got to 450 after false report of china ban so you gave out 22.5k?
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:13:17
Yes i feel more comfortable since btc futures are allowed.. I think volatility would go down and price will rise because of all the new monies
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:42:33
this isn't the dip lol 
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:22:06
aaaaaaaaaaand: 
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:00:30
by knowingly i mean they know the tether is BS and not backed up w/ real USD
@_date: 2017-12-23 02:37:15
, the price you paid for it no longer matter. 
How much you lost/gained doesnt matter. What matters is how much you have once you sell.
 This is a literal contradiction and makes no logical sense. Sorry I don't understand your point.
Btw, explain to me what the cardinal sin of investing was that i supposedly said. Surely it isn't the fact that a person is less likely to sell a btc dip that they bought @ 1k then someone who bought at 20k.
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:35:58
not really..

I'm not that bold
i did not hold
instead i sold
@_date: 2017-12-10 00:34:58
it might be worth 60 dollars by then end of next year
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:08:38
You shouldn't give out that kind of info, now you have the attention of possible hackers...
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:35:52
up to what? They promised to allow BCH many months ago...
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:39:21
You don't need a driver's license.. You can use an I.D card which is provided by the DMV 
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:14:15
bro what are you on about.. A person could've bought 100 bitcoins for 23,000.. We're not limited to one bitcoin.. "Size of the position" matters in both cases..
@_date: 2017-12-06 23:55:28
Most likely he used your SSN to buy on an exchange under your name. Did you ever have access to the exchange or even a wallet? If he received it after your broke up why would he gift you the coins anyway? He probably sold them for like less than 100 dollars lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:24:29
And if anyone actually thinks he's giving out .1 bitcoin daily is delusional
@_date: 2017-12-23 00:58:31
you realize gemini halts trading as well, as does every other exchange
@_date: 2017-12-22 03:29:34
sell it now
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:51:27
it's over 3000 + 9000!!!!
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:37:28
bro if you never sell then how would people be able to buy BTC to raise the price in the first place?
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:20:55
I actually don't even know! but it's not wise to buy at an all time high
@_date: 2017-12-10 04:03:18
oh that's cute you think i'm implying they wont short it because i didn't agree with OP's opinion that WS is trying to "destroy bitcoin out of pure spite because of some sort of agenda".
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:46:03
it will crash thanks to bitfinex/tether scam
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:27:13
IOTA is a shit coin w/ shit developers.
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:42:23
ALSO apparently their employees were still allowed trading at around 8-9k when they froze it for everyone else.. I assume they thought people wouldn't notice?? Not sure how accurate that claim is..
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:27:38
yeah i bet you would shit your pants if you bought at 18k
@_date: 2017-12-10 02:24:12
no that's how chance works.. That's like saying the odds of winning the lottery every time you play is 50 percent.. "Either you win or you don't" lmao
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:43:46
That's proof of sending transactions to a btc adress.. It's not proof that the youtube user or the adress he sent it to isn't his.. DO you honestly think some greedy fuck who is advertising an obvious ponzi to get more revenue from referrals will be giving away 1k+ DAILY?! 
@_date: 2017-12-11 04:05:20
pretty close, i set buy orders of 14k and got them both times, nice profit lol
@_date: 2017-12-22 02:04:46
legit smart choice, take your profits, don't risk losing more
@_date: 2017-12-10 03:16:40
hell no
@_date: 2017-12-30 22:04:15
i think they have to
@_date: 2017-12-07 02:09:57
ok just buy at the dip 
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:11:03
DO you not have an I.D that is provided by your government you can use? Try that.. Also before anything, make sure coinbase has a relationship w/ any bank in your country so you would be able to withdraw money because from what i heard, people in Canada cannot get paid because coinbase doesn't have any banking partners there. Call their phone support.
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:54:34
well good luck then, you have been warned
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:27:00
Just look through this guy twitter posts:  
 he provides clear evidence of the fraud/scamming bitfinex is doing
@_date: 2017-12-12 05:38:56
you're delusional if you believe this
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:13:33
Also: 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:23:16
You're not going to be able to trade w/o verifying your identity.. All accounts have to be verified.. 
@_date: 2017-12-11 01:16:21
lol bitcoin volatility in 09
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:46:26
how much you bought?
@_date: 2017-12-06 06:03:33
No and there doesn't need to be one
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:43:06
people say they "need" it to correct because they missed the chance to buy before the price suddenly rose, and so now they don't want to buy at an all time high price, they want to wait for a price drop so they can get a faster return or feel more comfortable with their investment.
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:04:48
I DID I DID BUY OMG OMG
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:30:22
why are you trading to gemini?
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:50:08
If you bought 1 btc at 19k, you current holding fee is -$4,700 
@_date: 2017-12-10 01:44:45
Yes! What you should do is wire transfer as much money as much as you can to GDAX (coinbase's exchange).. Then you can literally instantly buy as much btc/eth/ltc you want.. If you make limit orders you don't even have to pay a fee. 
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:36:31
1 btc for the first name to be Hodl and middle name Bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 01:20:51
i have the SAME EXACT problem, my order for 19000 didn't fill and i can't even cancel it.. I dont want to recieve my btc at such a lower price
@_date: 2017-12-22 23:54:37
what?! of course it does! if i bought at 20k and it goes to 10k, i've lost 50 percent of my initial investment! A person buying at 1k is more inclined to hold because they didn't lose any money.
@_date: 2017-12-01 02:26:01
He had 70k btc at the time of the pizza purchase WOW did he miss out if he sold all
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:29:30
Hell yeah I'm sad as fuck man
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:23:30
Why would you buy btc from someone and have it sent to coinbase wallet if you can just buy it from coinbase directly?
@_date: 2017-12-20 05:29:05
 coinbase and their investor friends bought A LOT of BCash (pumping it up knowing the price will skyrocket) therefore causing others to buy in .. Then they added Bcash trading suddenly to their exchange w/o announcing it causing people to freak out and buy at their market price hoping to make a profit. people had to buy at market price b/c it was just so fast and so some people bought it at 6-7k which is double the actual price and then they froze trading at 9k which sucks for the people who bought in lower because they're going to lose money once trading resumes, and when it resumes it will be at a much lower price presumably
@_date: 2017-12-11 02:42:30
@_date: 2017-12-20 04:27:13
Coinbase is fucking great! They add Bcash out of nowhere to cause btc to dip to make even more profit! Why are you whining, did you invest all your money at 19k!?
@_date: 2017-12-07 00:02:48
i just got on i didnt even check lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:47:12

@_date: 2017-12-07 01:36:27
so what was the tx fee?
@_date: 2017-12-18 02:54:36
You have to pay taxes when you trade for cash.. If you hold it you don't.. You're suggesting the opposite
@_date: 2017-12-09 23:49:03
aw hell yeah, it's not like the fees or price fluctuations are preventing this! /s
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:00:55
wait for the fucking dip. There has always been one. The dips were short in duration so you have to keep an eye on the price at all times!
@_date: 2017-12-07 01:06:17
I should've held
@_date: 2017-12-22 04:18:11

@_date: 2017-12-23 01:59:46
you'd rather use kraken lmao the kraken whose servers are constantly down, can't withdraw your money from them, who knowingly promotes USDT (tethers) 
@_date: 2017-12-12 03:41:57
bitcorn is for the rich
@_date: 2017-12-23 01:37:06
yes go to bitfinex instead and use their fake tether money lol they're totally not frauds /s
@_date: 2017-12-10 19:49:56
you need a whole bitcoin
@_date: 2017-12-18 04:33:34
what dip??
@_date: 2017-12-01 01:29:53
It's considered an asset so you do have to report how many dollars worth of BTC you have, though I think. But you wont have to pay any taxes unless you trade or sell them
@_date: 2017-12-22 06:07:00
yeah the ones who bought under 5k and have only a couple hundred invested lol
@_date: 2017-12-06 02:23:50
absolute garbage.. Same shit videos showing how much money he makes off a ponzi scheme 
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:53:36
no f*ck off
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:22:06
I've never tried neither of those options so look at google
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:58:48
but.. but.. it is 3%..
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:42:13
call them and verify that you were trying to purchase from coinbase and that it got declined
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:41:00
@_date: 2017-11-30 05:11:25
Actually they're becoming more involved w/ collecting your taxes, not controlling bitcoin...
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:04:30
the dip was 10k and lasted a couple of minutes
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:36:07
1 day for WIRE TRANSFER
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:25:24
how many btc have you accumulated ?
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:40:00
yes because even though coinbase is mainly U.S based, they charge the bank from LONDON. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 04:34:11
Well do you even use bitcoins to purchase stuff or are you just investing for the long term? If you don't use it frequently for purchases then a downed-website for a bit shouldn't really matter
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:31:32
it hit 10k on gdax for the first time..
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:54:10
-.- "hello I trying to buy a product from a company called Coinbase and my card was declined because they are charging it from London. I need you to unblock my godamn card you stupid cunts"
@_date: 2017-11-14 02:26:06
no! Buy low, sell high, repeat, use that profit to buy more and hodl that
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:06:53
LOL same here
@_date: 2017-11-29 05:18:57
me rn
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:34:02
maybe they think it's a fraudulent charge.. I was declined as well and I had to call my bank to verify the first time I tried to buy..
@_date: 2017-11-30 06:49:01
I really don't understand how this happens... Can you explain in detail?
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:18:16
Well it wasn't all of his coins. He had 70,000 and spent 10k.. but still... 95 million dollars LOL
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:09:42
yes wikipedia is a project of wikimedia. I was just answering why it didn't show on the wikipedia page
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:11:44
what a waste of money. go ahead, buy it
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:37:30
no way it will be 80-100k in one year
@_date: 2017-11-30 03:57:15
weird how 9k is  pretty low now
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:11:58
That is normal for btc now, not like the old days..
@_date: 2017-11-29 00:32:35
I don't see why it wouldn't be taxable..

that's wikimedia though, not wikipedia
@_date: 2017-11-29 01:36:07
500k and 1m in 2019 that's cute
@_date: 2018-02-01 01:42:37
