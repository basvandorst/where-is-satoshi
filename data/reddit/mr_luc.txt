Or maybe some proportion of the superusers of a cryptocurrency are the kind of people who really, really value their privacy and won't say anything in public that could draw attention to them.

That's a nice quote.

Ah, son of a gun. I was a semi-early-adopter, but I was out of the loop and looks like it's biting me. 
I got in, not at the ground floor, but when blockchain.info was new back when I could buy btc in the US via a Moneygram. I sold most of that initial $50 buy when btc were between $700 and $1000.
I left some btc crumbs in my account because I still believe in the magical internet money, though I've never believed in the moon (the tech, yes, and I'd always like to have some btc; in a particular price level, no).
Given the current bump, I tried to move them somewhere spendable ... yeaaaahhhhh, I just used the default (blockchain.info) interface, and it's definitely taking a bit more than a half hour so far. I wonder if I'm screwed.

Yup. This just in, the most powerful people in the world sometimes influence others. Mind==blown?

By that logic, Donald Trump shouldn't have a successful show on tv.
And he could slightly underperform index funds over time and still do fairly well.

Heyhey! It took 50 minutes. Now they're somewhere else.

This is what I'm most interested in.
Bitcoin is an amazing invention that solved so many problems at once; it's incredible, etc ...
But my question is, how recognizable is the traffic? How blockable at the ISP level? If the government essentially shuts down exchanges, say, and at the ISP level decides that it's important to make Bitcoin die, what kinds of protections are there now in the protocol against this?
Or if now it's not that resilient, is it possible to run the whole shebang over a network like Tor in the future, or is that somehow prohibitive because of torlike latency?

I bought $50 worth a year ago. I took out $700 of gift cards, so I'm way ahead.
What's left was worth $3500 a few days ago. So it's worth $2k now. Who cares!
I would be totally fine with 'going down with the ship,' just because bitcoin is so damned cool. Let it ride. :D
