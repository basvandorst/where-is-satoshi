Actually they've been down more than they've been up, and we're currently only a few percent higher than January 1st. 2018s high trading value was \~2.2x higher than 2019s high. A 20% decrease in traffic really seems to line up with the fact that a lot of people on the exchange are in the red on their investments right now and aren't motivated to watch/trade further.

Everyone is glossing over the fact that he was saying if you bought stocks conservatively between 1998 and 2018 you'd have 170% growth. on initial investment. No one is saying 170% in a day, a week, or a month. Stocks should be the majority of anyone's portfolio if they're serious about taking care of their wealth long term.

You don't have to buy whole bitcoins though, that is exactly his point. You can still invest only $30-50 and take the SAME risk. % growth is the only thing that matters. It's not a traditional stock, you don't have to buy a whole share to invest.

12 can be quartered, and divided into thirds also. It's no 49 though.

They are refusing to invest more time into something that is clearly high risk from all traditional methods of measuring it. Bitcoin has a lot of red flags attached to it. Do I think it's a bad investment? No. Do I think it's a safe investment? Probably, but I'm also not sinking all my money into it either. It's a part of a diverse portfolio of investments.
Someone who doesn't want to invest in something that is very much high risk on face value isn't being willfully ignorant just because they're not researching it more, they're just saving their time to invest in something else. Instead of preaching at them or coming to reddit expecting everyone else to tell you how dumb they are, let them live their lives and do what they want with their money and don't worry about them.

it's inventory but the token's purpose is to be redeemed for those big macs. In this situation they are one and the same.

Still takes time and resources to manufacture. Until we have something akin to a Star Trek replicator attached to a near limitless energy supply, any consumption based product is still going to have finite supplies based upon production capacity and time.

You're completely discounting the fact that big macs are finite though. Sure new ones are created at an alarming rate, but they're also consumed nearly as quickly, and unless something's changed in the last 5 minutes, I'm pretty sure renewable resources such as meat are still finite in current supply.
The only way the big mac can be truly inflationary is if McD's starts producing more of them than are consumed, and then continuing to serve them. Today's special, 3 day old Big Macs, same price as fresh ones.

I'm going long term on NEM/XEM, it looks pretty solid and is apparently getting a lot of traction in Japan

I mean if these guys get DCO approval that means huge growth from institutional adoption right?
