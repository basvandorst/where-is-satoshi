No, I don't believe it is a true random walk, but the random walk theory does fit nicely with my views on TA: 


[From Wiki](
In reality I think it is a pseudo-random walk around certain price points, which are based on "fundamentals" like network development and adoption. So if we are at the "true" value at 415 (for example), the price will randomly walk around that level until something either raises or lowers the floor (those periods of stability). 
I'm not a trader, but maybe that is obvious.

Ran a criminal enterprise and directly profited from drug sales made through his site. He actively policed the vendors to ensure all deals went through SR so that he would get his cut. 
A lot of people here argue he just made a site and what others used it for isn't his responsibility, but that's simply wishing the law said something other than it did. 
Under the laws of the US he was effectively a cartel head. Whether you disagree with those laws is an entirely different issue. 
I think the war on drugs is a crime against humanity. I also think Ulbricht is guilty under the law. Some people seem to have trouble internally reconciling the two. Sort of like OJ did it AND the police tried to frame him. It's not an either/or, but I digress.

They do prosecute establishments and individuals that overserve, all the time.
If your wife is killed by a drunk driver who ordered 20 beers for himself in two hours at a bar any decent lawyer (depending on the jurisdiction's dram shop laws) will name the bar and bartender as defendants along with the driver himself. 
Your analogy falls apart because there is nothing inherently illegal with manufacturing alcohol and the distributors do not owe a duty of care to the end consumer in most cases because they are too removed from the actual offending transaction itself.

Well, if he actually mined them, and is satoshi, he could prove it. 
In the US his cost basis would be based on the cost of his mining rigs back then. So he would owe tax on (sale price) - ([cost of equipment and power]/1.1 million) = probably a lot. No idea what the Australian approach is.
I think they are exploring what has actually been going on with the trust because it certainly looks like those 1.1m coins may be used a collateral for traditional funding. That's quite different from "they've never been touched!"

We don't have proof they even existed in the first place.
With no concrete evidence of what happened it is possible Gox was running a fractional reserve following the 2011 hack. Throw in a crazy price climb that made replacing those lost coins very difficult and subsequent bank issues including the US seizing 5+ million in cash, the collapse was pretty much inevitable.
This is just one possibility and there's just as little evidence to support this as every other theory, unless you find the purported leaked DB informative.

You know what hurt a loss worse than doing the math (over and over) to see how much money I left on the table by not selling before the April bubble popped?
Doing the same math in December to see how much I could have made if I had simply held the majority of my stash from May until then. Hurt about four times more, actually. I was so pissed off (at myself) after April that I walked away from bitcoin for 5 months and only came back in late October. 
Is this time different? Probably. Does that mean it won't go back up? It might. Is it guaranteed? No. Was anything guaranteed with bitcoin? Never. Nobody knows how this ride is going to end. That's why we try to beat it into people's heads that this isn't a get rich scheme, if you put money in kiss it goodbye and be surprised if it works out in your favor. 
If you can't handle those rules, or don't like the risk, don't play. Nobody is forcing anybody to buy bitcoin and, honestly, I get the sense that *a lot* of the people that have found the bitcoin subs in the last few months have absolutely no business putting a dime into the market.

"In order to comply with KYC and AML laws we reserve the right to require more information about certain transactions and/or close your account."
It's the same way banks do it, it's just easier to get flagged for something because bitcoin is ever so slightly easier to track than cash or other payments.
It would be nice to know how to stay on the right side of their policies but they won't disclose them because it would enable others to fly under the radar and evade them. Realistically it will never happen.

I can only give you anecdotal evidence, but there was a time in 2013 when I did some OTC trades. Maybe all the people I became familiar with were lying or pushing an agenda, but I don't have any reason to doubt their stories. 
I've seen the same list of banks pop-up in reddit posts about account closures (particularly Chase, although that's my bank and I use the same account now as then). I haven't seen anything inconsistent with what I've observed/overheard. 
I think one of the biggest explanations for why it happens to some and not others is probably the background of the account holder. I make a nice salary so a few grand going in and out of an account isn't suspicious. If you are a 20 year old kid that usually has $500 in savings, multiple four figure transfers are going to stand out a bit more. 
I just don't see the reason to doubt this is happening. It is public information that banks have AML/KYC laws they have to comply with. They would be breaking the law if they didn't close accounts with suspicious activity.

They should be less concerned about BTC than USD. If you want to know where terrorist money is going and they are using bitcoin there are only a handful of places that they have to monitor to find where they are cashing out in order to buy MANPADS. If I give you a briefcase full of cash can you find where I spent it more easily? 
If you are selling coins to get back into cash you need a bank or an exchange. These are centralized points of failure which law enforcement absolutely love. I'm pretty sure Iran, China, and Russia aren't accepting bitcoin in exchange for weapons (if they are, the price should be MUCH higher IMO). 
I'm not even one of the kool-aid drinkers, but this terrorist and drug dealer bullshit is, frankly, bullshit. There may be a few big players that are able to operate with some form of anonymity but if you get to the level of full-out war, BTC is a lot easier to trace than a few pallets of cash. 
The problem is we can't sell Government on the traceable nature of the transactions at the same time we promise anonymous digital cash to the users.

I know where you are coming from, this concept applies to a ton of things "regular" people do all year long - who declared gambling profits from their Super Bowl pool? March Madness? You dirty tax frauds. 
The difference, though, is in enforcement. The blockchain makes it a lot easier to track dates and purchases, if you can identify merchant addresses. There are ways to obfuscate this, but the point is if the government wants to come after you for tax fraud they probably can and a public ledger only helps them. 
In short, big purchases (you bought a house for 500 btc that you paid $30 for a few years back? Yeah, good luck explaining why you didn't declare a gain on the transaction . . . ) should be treated appropriately but the rule applies to everything. Enforcement, however, is another matter.

In general the stamp=gox comparisons seemed stretched given what we know, but I agree with you here and this seems to be what happened with Gox. At the end of the day it is just a matter of time until you end up with a worker who decides whatever he is being paid (almost certainly less than six figures) isn't enough to overcome the urge to pilfer a huge sum of money. Most people are honest, but even if only 10% of them would commit a crime if they thought they could get away with it you have a serious problem when it comes to access to bitcoin. 
Exchanges need a way to completely remove the ability for rogue workers to access wallets. I'm not sure how to marry security and accessibility since I'm not a tech guy, but it seems like multisig is definitely a step in the right direction.

I'm not going to spend more than 3 minutes browsing the USC, as much fun as that may be for others on a Friday night, but my gut instinct was that changetip is exempt from MTB/MTS regulations because they deal only in bitcoin. You can't cash out your changetip account for dollars and you can't deposit dollars into it, as far as I know.

Dude that runs Mpex is a crazy narcissist that happened to get rich (if he cashed out) from being an early adopter. I think the MPEX buy-in was 10k coins just for a seat at the table even after the price hit $30. He also just consented to a $50k fine from the SEC for selling unregistered securities.

It is just things that happened that The Simpsons already did. 
So if they made a joke about a political candidate building a wall in 1994, someone could post Donald Trump talking about his wall and say "Simpsons did it (already)!"

@_date: 2015-04-02 05:01:57
Yes. They arrested and flipped him, he gave admin access to the site and showed them how to use it and Bridge literally left that briefing early to use the info to steal the money. Then DPR hits up nob (Force) to kill flush for the theft.
It's fucked up both murder-for-hire plots were actually scams, one of which involved not one but two dirty Feds who appear to have been working independently of each other.
@_date: 2015-04-02 17:27:14
Unfortunately it isn't entrapment to provide all of the tools necessary to commit the crime as long as the person was predisposed to actually do the criminal act beforehand. 
If you tell someone they have to sell a kilo or you will take their kids away, or harm their family, etc, then you'd have entrapment. But saying "hey man, I got this key of primo blow, think you'd sell it for me?" and getting a yes is legally sound. 


Nod agreed to receive the pack and then send it to the actual purchaser, I assume sort of like escrow and allowed the end-vendor to keep his address close to the chest (and it worked, since nod got popped instead of him). 
I totally agree with you that this whole thing is shady as shit, unfortunately LE is allowed to be shady. It seriously sucks, from my perspective, that the single biggest thing that caused people to turn against DPR were the two hits, neither of which ever actually happened and one of which was only coordinated as a direct result of illegal acts by a government agent (stealing using ~~nod's~~ flush's account, then agreeing to kill him for it) but the fact remains DPR was the one that agreed to have them whacked. 
@_date: 2015-04-02 16:46:30
The info is out there but I don't have it on hand.
DPR thought nod was a big dealer and was trying to get him to sell on SR. He actually convinced flush to accept delivery as part of winning the business. Flush took a controlled delivery and it was game over after that.
A lot of the mistakes that were made were actually traps he walked right into (like basically leading flush to the pokey) or were the result of other scams (the hit on flush, redandwhite). I can't help but wonder how long it could have lasted if DPR had less expansion in mind and was willing to chalk up theft and extortion as a cost of business. Pride before the fall and all that.

I haven't read *how* it does that yet. 
Edit: If I'm reading it right, the ELI5 version is you create a secret address with an initial small btc transfer, then use that address to send coins and the wallet sequesters those coins so they are not mixed with your coins from a "non-private" address. You basically end up with one account in wallet that is public transactions and another that is private.

Can't read the paper on mobile, but spousal immunity is based on the sanctity of marriage. The 5th prevents forced compulsion of information at trial, preexisting records and docs (including diaries) don't fall under it because the government isn't forcing you to testify in that case. 
There is case law about whether you can be forced to hand over passphrases to bypass encryption, but that doesn't apply here because they got the laptop while it was unlocked. I would note that the law isn't settled in that area and I'm guessing that's what the article is about.

Sounds like you would have been fine had you actually done your homework before starting the experiment and had accounts ready to go, which a serious arbitrageur would. 
Those are necessary steps, otherwise everybody would be doing it and the price differential would disappear. The only reason btc-e is so low is because most people don't want to send USD to it. Given the right infrastructure and timelines (being able to wait for ACH transfers without a liquidity crunch once the cheap coins are sold with a markup) there's a great spread to be had using btc-e as your bitcoin source and a number of "exchanges" as your dumping grounds.

They take .06% each way (less once you hit a certain level) so as long as you can clear roughly a 1.2% spread you will make out. 
Of course, you won't make any money doing this selling at $41 and buying back at $39 unless you are doing it with a lot of coins at once. And then you run the risk that the last time you sold at $41 is when the market was taking off, leaving you in the dust. 
I've been looking to dump a piece for a while, but I'm not going to do anything like that while the market is doing this. So in the mean time I don't mind throwing gas on to the fire and playing the razor thin walls. Worst case scenario is the coins I'm using are stuck as cash, which was sort of my goal anyway. 
Your circumstances probably vary. I don't recommend doing it my way, over the long term its probably even less of a sure thing than Satoshi Dice. But right now the swings are fun to play.

Was it your SR wallet you sent it to? I haven't used SR before, so I don't know if SR takes BTC you send it and tumbles it or something. 
It could be that your transaction got caught in tonight's SNAFU, but that's sheer speculation on my part with zero technical knowledge to back it up.
(For the record, the price 2 hours ago was at $38. You could have possibly sold at a higher price than now (mid $44, but I think with the lag and the waiting game chances are you would have lost money. [Sauce]( 
@_date: 2013-03-19 22:27:55
It gets complicated.
Fiat gets stuck in exchanges, so if you need the cash sooner than you can get it out this won't work. Also, you need to calculate all of the fees and then see if the spread is profitable. 
Usually this will end up being a rather small number, so you need a lot of coins to make it worthwhile, but that exposes you to greater risk.
Basically if you are pretty liquid for the next few weeks it can be worthwhile. Last week there was a $4 gap between coinbase and a certain exchange. If you had 50 coins already, it was a no brainer to place an order for fifty through coinbase and sell fifty of your own at the higher rate, as long as you believe the price isn't going to fall before your coins come in. At the end you would still have 50 coins plus another $200. Or so I'm told.
Of course a lot can happen in the time it takes a coinbase purchase to clear. Also, good luck getting USD into btc-e if that's your plan for purchases.

Welcome to bitcoin. Don't sell or buy in a panic. Most times things will work out just fine.

The knee-jerk reaction is "Oh fuck, they pulled a runner." But it is still too early to bust out the pitchforks. If they are actually fixing something, starting a riot/bank-run isn't going to help anything. If they actually bolted with coins (which I still highly doubt), starting a riot won't help. 
FWIW, I have a bunch of coins stuck in a pending transfer out and even more supposed to come in tomorrow (yes, from back in the good ol' days when it cost three coins to buy a piece of nickle candy). I'll probably be more fucked than you if you are right.

My investment strategy is to have half sitting offline (just as much to keep me from touching it as it is to keep it safe from others) and the other half in Gox. I like to play the swings with the Gox half, but I wouldn't recommend that unless you like stress and adventure. 
Dollar cost averaging is the safest way to do it.

They were there but I didn't want to dance with the lag monster tonight. If you guess wrong you cash out and it goes up, leaving you holding your pants. If you hold tight, and you know its coming back up (such as tonight which was another spook, not a legit market event) you end up back at ground zero, possibly less a few bucks. 
If I could have held off 13 hours I would have had the cash specifically ear marked for this event, ready to go. 
But so goes the life of the gamblers that play swings.

I agree, have you looked at how to get money into btc-e, OP?
You can give your CC info to a Russian processor (no thanks) or pay for an international wire transfer and hope the price gap is both still there when the money hits and that the fees didn't eat up your margin (no thanks). 
They also charge you a fee to withdraw BTC, whereas other exchanges don't. Tally up your costs and expenses and its not worth the hassle. 
If I had money on there already I'd be pimping the shit out of it, but it isn't worth getting into today. 
@_date: 2013-03-14 15:37:22
Yup. SD actually is a good thing in my opinion because it is forcing the community to solve this problem now. Taking that off the table makes it a lot easier to argue BTC is ready for the mainstream. 
There is going to be a lot of resistance to clearing houses of any sort because it starts to create a lot of the institutions the current BTC community rejects. Plus, they have to profit off of it so the cheap/free transfer benefit may be diluted. On the other hand, if it is all done inside a clearing house (like a Gox to Gox transfer) there wouldn't be a need for a standard transaction fee. 
I'm not a developer or even all that tuned into the discussions they are having about this problem, so take all this with a grain of salt.

No. They aren't rules, they are just guidance. It's a government agency telling everybody "FYI, here is how we interpret this, be advised that if you don't agree with our interpretation we may come after you."
It isn't binding and it remains for the Courts to ratify or reject their interpretation (or congress, through legislation). The fact that he "lied" in 2011 and the regulations came out after the fact don't matter. The court will either agree with the interpretation that Gox is a money transmitter and therefore had to comply with all of those regulations or not. Even if FinCen had never issued guidance that would still be the issue here.
It is very common for businesses to operate in areas that haven't been fleshed out yet. The only way you learn if you are doing it the right way is when the court sides with you when the government tries to screw you. In this case Gox was stupid for not taking advantage of the guidance and getting their shit together before this happened.

There are irc channels and websites designed for that type of transaction. The irc setup is based on reputation without a formal escrow service, as far as I know, because that minimizes transaction costs. Of course, the reputation of an internet pseudonym is only worth as much stock as you put into it (sort of like bitcoin itself . . . ). 
I'm not a member of any of those places and was being tongue-in-cheek - you have a very good reason to be suspicious!
BUT - if you really wanted to I'd throw you some coins for the market price plus a minimal fee to cover the transaction costs of turning your cash back into bitcoins. It would probably be easier (and safer for both of us) for you to find somewhere that actually does this sort of transaction. Even if you decided to trust me, if you sent USD via paypal then my ass is hanging in the wind because of the possibility of a chargeback.

@_date: 2013-03-20 03:13:50
The allocation of hashing power doesn't speed up coin generation (technically it does, slightly) because the difficulty is adjusted to keep block generation at roughly the same rate. 
The concern is one or two groups representing 51+% of the network's hashing power because then the entire community would be dependent on that group deciding not to rewrite the blockchain in their favor. There are ways to correct it (the fork event the other night is an example of how you can redirect the chain) but the pain in the ass that would result would still be real. 
It may not actually be too different than the fork we saw the other night, except it might take longer for people to realize doublespends and other funny things were happening.

I'll make sure to pass your opinion on to those that care.*
If the EFF has a pecuniary interest in bitcoins being found legitimate that raises the possibility of their own interests conflicting with that of the client. The client may want to decide to settle the case for whatever reason, including they are simply tired of the litigation. In that case the EFF's interests would arguably be adverse to the client's because the EFF would be best served by either avoiding negative precedent or establishing positive precedent. 


Are they using the exact same encryption for the exact same purposes? The law is fact intensive, you can't throw out a generalization with absolutely zero context and make a sweeping statement, particularly "any weight whatsoever." You seriously can't imagine *any* scenario where a conflict of interest arises?
Do you even practice law, bro?
Admittedly this isn't as clear cut as I initially made it out to be, but in the legal field discretion is the better part of valor.** The EFF's role in the legal community is founded largely on its reputation as an uninvolved intervenor. That quickly evaporates if they are engaging in the same behavior they are defending. As I said, they would be swamped with accusations of serving their own interests if they started accepting bitcoins and then were actively involved in the fight to legitimize same. 
They are being flamed in this thread for not being courageous enough to adopt bitcoin, any coming storm be damned. That's not a realistic outlook and ignores the truths of the legal system. 
*How you feel about it has absolutely zero bearing on their policy decisions and the reasons for them. 
**While it is just one example, they would clearly be disqualified from representation if the legal proceedings included prospective/injunctive relief. At that point they have a very clear conflict and would be almost immediately disqualified in most US jurisdictions for the same reason that a class-counsel cannot also be members of the class.

Not that I want to talk you into buying coins, but a lot of your concerns can be assuaged. 
(1) it isn't that complicated, it may take a while to really understand what is going on technically, but if all you want is to have some coins for the future that can be done relatively easily. After all, how much of the process do you understand every time you swipe a debit or credit card? Chances are there is more to it than you think. 
(2) The volatility is real, but I think we starting to come out of the woods now. Part of the problem is a lot of people, especially those looking to make a quick buck, are waiting for the shoe to drop because of what happened before. I'm not saying it won't or can't happen again, but if it does it will be for very different reasons. In 2011 there was almost nothing actually supporting the system. If you look now, it is slowly creeping into the traditional payment marketplace. Put aside all the talk about changing the world and overthrowing the banks, just look at what a BTC is worth if it gets even 1% of internet commerce. It is starting to make inroads. 
(3) You want people buying in cheap when shit goes down like this. Don't let that scare you off. If anything, it shows there are people there that actually value the market at its current price, if not higher, otherwise they wouldn't step in and would let it slide all the way back down to $1 or $0. 
Do your homework. If you think bitcoins are going to be worth the risk, the difference between today's price and tomorrow isn't going to be what holds you back from living the dream. Just make sure you know what you are getting into. 
I'm really not sure why I bothered to answer your post when the rest of them are summarily dismissed, but I guess I have a soft spot for the antipodeans. Good luck.

@_date: 2013-03-09 20:49:03
is 100% correct. 
A bear trap is when the price starts to go down so the pessimists bail because they think its the end. Then the price bounces up and leaves them holding their dicks wishing they hadn't sold out. It looks like a V on the chart. 
A bull trap is when the price starts to climb and the optimists think its about to take off, so they pile in. And then it tanks. This looks like a ^ on the chart. 
All of the naysayers that are convinced bitcoin is a bubble will tell you the sell off to $33 the other day was when the bubble popped and we are currently in the bull-trap phase. The sigh of relief is artificially propping the price up, but will eventually give way also.

ELI5: Don't pre-order any ASIC rig today. 
TL;dr: You will be just another face in the sea of ASIC rigs by the time yours shows up, meaning your ROI is going to be a lot shittier than you think. 
Full post: Everybody and their mother wants an ASIC rig now, especially with the hike in price. Unfortunately, since everybody wants one, they are going to become the norm for mining. This means you are going to see something more like the mediocre returns people are getting with GPU mining today, but with a very high capital cost. If the price of bitcoin falls you may very well be mining in the red due to power consumption, too. 
If you really want to mine, stick around for a while and try to get an ASIC at a discount later, either once the premium for them is gone (and the profitability probably will come out the same) or by snagging a second-hand one from someone else who didn't realize they aren't bitcoin faucets.

Now, when it comes to bitcoin? Yeah, theres no chance in hell someone is going to convince a court that FinCen's position is wrong.

Coinbase is super cheap, 1% fee, but it takes 5 days to fund so if you need them faster (or if the price drops preciptiously) that won't work. The 5 day window has been great for purchasers the last 6 weeks because almost every single purchase has been worth more the instant it hits the account. 
There are complaints about the fraud algorithm, but so far it seems that Coinbase has resolved every one of them through followup emails/tweets and even here in Bitinstant is another option. 
Ziggap is getting good reviews, but I haven't used it. 
You should also look into localbitcoins.com, even if there isn't a seller in your neighborhood you might be able to score some through email escrow.
@_date: 2013-03-22 21:44:44
To your point I would add this, as devil's advocate. 
The price is being touted as legitimate evaluation of potential due to growth, the EU situation, etc (see the articles saying the rise this week was "100% due to the Cyprus"). We have absolutely zero ability to confirm if any of that is true. Maybe the true price even with all of that shit is really $40, which is a giant leap from $15 at the start of the year. The rest of the value is derived solely from wishes. As my grandpappy used to say, shit in one hand and wish in the other- let me know which one fills up first. 
Bitcoin is great for people that want to hear what they want to hear, selectively screen out the bad information and use the good to support your "legitimate" bitcoin price point. 
(Full disclosure - I have a ton of coins and would rather not see the price stay below $70)

Edit: your post sounds a lot like you are doing research/soliciting plaintiffs for a lawsuit. That could just be my lawyer senses acting up, but we are.pretty adept at sniffing out other leeches.
I've made a lot of large purchases with them since early January. I have never had a transaction cancelled due to fraud. I have been affected by the unconfirmed coins last month and the stuck transfers last night, but that was resolved.
From my observations almost everybody that has had a transaction cancelled has fixed it after dealing with customer service.
I have a large order set to arrive tonight and I placed yet another, but smaller order today. 
I have my full faith in the company, but that's probably because I haven't been affected too much by their issues. If either of my buys are cancelled and not manually pushed through, my take will change.
Until then they are just an overwhelmed startup trying to cope with insane demand nobody saw coming, not a malicious group scamming handpicked customers.
@_date: 2013-04-06 01:36:22
You have to match buy and sells under accounting principles. Cherry picking the costs is a no-no. "I can't keep track of all the transactions" probably won't go over too well. You were also supposed to report earnings or losses each year as they occurred. To cure this you could file an amended return.

Definitely. Yesterday, when I saw for the first time that they had essentially forked off the blockchain it made sense why they were having these issues. 
Now, why the hell did it take them that long to say that? It doesn't take more than 2 minutes to post something and in fact takes just as long as posting their generic "Yeah, we are working on it" messages. 
The delay is understandable if that's what actually happened, although repairing the fork didn't take this long when the blockchain itself shat its pants a few weeks back.

The hate and vitriol goes both ways, to be honest. Look at post basically accusing people of personally destroying bitcoin by welcoming government sanction. That wasn't exactly an olive branch. 
I think there is room for both communities to exist. There are people here to profit, but they aren't subverting bitcoin by doing so. Wanting a windfall from purchasing coins on the eve of government legitimization doesn't make them an enemy, it makes them a human. 
Likewise, the anarco-capitalists/libertarians/non-statists* can continue to use bitcoin as they wanted. It is still decentralized, pseudo-anonymous, and largely uncontrollable. The only aspects of it that can be controlled are the intersections with governments and traditional commerce, which cows to legislation and governance. 
Calling people sheep gratefully celebrating their impending slaughter doesn't accomplish anything except reinforce both your view of them and their view of you. Most of the "sheep" probably have a lot of mistrust and disdain for the government, but they have even more fear. Not everybody can take a moral stand, for whatever reason. You can call it cowardice, but giving 10% to "thieves" to keep the weight of the US Government off your back is a pretty rational decision in my book. Sure, greater and faster change would happen if everybody was willing to say "Fuck your bullshit, Uncle Sam" and they certainly couldn't lock us all up, but I'm not willing to kiss my family and future goodbye for your ideals. 
No disrespect intended, although I'm sure I've already been written off by you and the people that agree with your sentiments.

Hah, if they take Gox down like that it will most likely be done with Gox's help. Under your scenario all of the coins Gox held might as will be.considered destroyed. If the government is after bitcoins and has the private key the coins aren't coming back. This would increase the price by cutting supply, but effect of active attempts to steal coins in the market would too.

It is only enforceable if there are centralized records. You are going to see the rise of regulated exchanges (coingox) along with the rise of dark exchanges. 
Things are going to get interesting when they try to enforce this. There will probably be a few people that are sloppy, and if the transactions are large enough they may be made examples of. This is only a short term problem as the black market will evolve to take in the business. 
I'm not advocating that anybody break any laws, this is just my guess based on past observations.

Right now I think there are too many uncertainties for a "bitcoin" company to make it to the traditional exchange. If your whole business is founded on something that could be deemed illegitimate by the US government at any time, investors aren't going to be knocking your door down to throw money at you.

First, this information is obviously intended for the US audience. 
Second, please don't flame me for "destroying" bitcoin by giving taxes to the system. What you do or don't do is entirely up to you. This is information people should know regardless of their position on taxes. 
Third, I am not a tax lawyer and this is not tax advice. I am also not advocating anybody break any laws or regulations. Use your head, make your own decisions. 
The TL;DR:
If you have capital gains for assets you held less than one year (you bought a coin in 2013, sold it in 2013) the gain is taxed at your normal tax rate (depending on your tax bracket). 
If you have long-term capital gains (you bought coins in 2011 and sold them in 2013) the tax rate is **ZERO** if you are in the 10% or 15% tax brackets and 15% if you are in the 25% or higher tax bracket. 
You can also do all sorts of neat accounting tricks like the rich people do to wash out gains, at least on paper. Any capital losses can be setoff against the gains, and can even become **deductions** if they exceed the gains. 
For example: You made $100 on coins and it is December 30th, 2013. The price of a coin falls $5 below what you just purchased your last batch of coins for. If you sell 20 of those coins, you have a $100 capital loss. Now your capital gains for the year are **ZERO**. Hopefully on January 1st, 2014, the price is still $5 below your purchase price and you can simply repurchase the coins for the price you sold them for. You now have the same amount of coins as before, but eliminated taxes on your gains. 
Please correct any information I may have wrong.

Well, according to this list of the largest bitcoin heists (which can be found over at shameless plug shameless plug) he ran off with between 200,000 and 500,00 BTC. 
That's $14.5 -$29 Million dollars if he cashed out today. 
Of course he would have massive slippage pumping that amount of coins into the system and he probably cashed out a significant portion already.

Time to speculate. At an average price of $31.50 that's 6,984 coins. Even if they jumped their average purchase price up to 31.75 because of the size of the transaction that's only $1750, small enough for someone looking to buy in with that kind cash to not really care. I can't imagine an "institution" like Coinbase would screw themselves out of that when they could just as easily buy throughout the day.

Havelock shows it at .6, FWIW. I bought 5 at .76 so I'm currently down .819 ($29 at the present exchange rate, for those keeping score at home). 
I don't plan on selling it though, when I put money into it it was to spread money in a few different bitcoin ventures. I could pull it out and enjoy the bitcoin appreciation, but that sort of defeats the whole point of the purchase. For my purposes I'm leaving it there.

Yes, but the context is the discussion of lost wallets. If 95% of the bitcoins were lost (not hiding) the divisibility would keep the system running. If the "lost" in that sentence really means that they were hiding (i.e., not lost) then yes, you would have a point.

Only if all of the bitcoins are lost due to negligence. Certainly a percentage of coins in existence are lost forever in wallets like that, but in theory the market price of a bitcoin should account for the reduced supply. 
Due to the divisibility of bitcoins all the way out to the satoshi you shouldn't worry about the bitcoin economy collapsing because everybody lost their money. What would happen is the bitcoins that weren't lost would increase in value due to increased scarcity.

I think the system would grind to a halt during the low-yield high difficulty mode and idle until it was either abandoned or the big rigs decided to jump back in to get things moving again. 
Also, I think mathematically there is no gain to do this. You can mine X% of the coins in a 2016 block window, toying with the difficulty just changes the rate of payout. If everybody is doing what you are doing then there is no incentive to do it because you aren't gaining anything more than you would if you weren't trying to game the system.

There is no such thing as receiving stolen property when it comes to bitcoins. If someone stole coins and you ended up with them, sucks for the person that lost the coins. Don't worry about that other than making sure it doesn't happen to you. 
[Here]( is a rather detailed discussion about Mt Gox and bitcoins you should read.
The moral of the story is not to leave bitcoins with other people unless you are ok with the risk. If I have coins in a paper wallet, its only my own dumb fault if they are stolen or lost. If I leave them with Mt Gox, it is up to somebody else to keep them safe and that somebody else happens to have a giant neon sign that says "loot me". 
tl;dr - don't worry about compromised coins and don't leave your money with a 3rd party unless you trust them more than you trust yourself or you need fast access for trading purposes.

Every wallet and every coin is in the blockchain for anybody to look at. Bitcoin isn't anonymous, it allows people using them to be anonymous if they try hard enough. 
It is possible to track the coins from wallet to wallet, but that only does so much. There would be multiple wallets involved, just for normal security reasons. But once those were cleared out people could only tell that the coins were moving. They wouldn't know why, maybe he bought something and the coins now are in the hands of a merchant with no clue where they came from. They also wouldn't know where the person with access to the wallet physically was. Given enough shuffling it the stash would have disappeared into the blockchain. 
For cashing out, it wouldn't be too hard as long as you were patient. You wouldn't post an ask wall on Gox for 500k coins, but you could certainly drop a few hundred or thousand every now and then and people would raise an eyebrow because large transactions are fun to wonder about, but there wouldnt be any way to tell it was you. Maybe the 1.2 million dollar purchase yesterday was Pirate's coins, who knows. 
Finally, there will only ever be 20,999,999.9769 (lets just call it 21 million) coins in existence due to the protocol. 
Edit: [Here]( (PDF) is a great paper tracing some large transactions and some of the initial coins. It shows you just how traceable transactions really are and is a fun read if you want to think about what Satoshi and the gang were up to when they were first stashing a shitload of coins.

I pre-ordered a rig near the end of January and cancelled it two weeks ago when the delays were stacking up because the difficulty is going to make it take a loooong time to get in the black. 
I think a better move is wait for them to drop in price and then grab one if you really want to mine. Paying a nice chunk less than the first buyers will put you on even ground with them. Cutting the time needed to turn a profit by 2-3 months means a lot because unless you are one of the first few to enjoy low difficulty levels, mining is going to be a lot more like grinding than most people think.

If you are asking "what happened last night" this must be your first weekend watching the bitcoin exchange rate. This happens every weekend. Last weekend it went from $28 and change on Friday down to $26 by Sunday. Of course by Tuesday it was in the mid-29s again. 
Now is the time to try to play the margins if you have cojones, otherwise ride it out. Personally, if I can squeeze a few half a bitcoins out of the market simply by selling and buying the same coins, that's alright with me. 
The glass is half-empty if you thought we were going nowhere but up. The glass is half-full if you see the opportunity to game the system on the weekends. Of course this completely ignores any discussion about volatility and its impact on bitcoin adoption.

But nobody would tell you to use Coinbase as your exchange. It takes little work to move the coins to Gox from there. The only hassle comes from getting cash out of Gox. 
If you look at them as far as providing coins through ACH transfers, I think they do a pretty good job ("fraud algorithm" issues notwithstanding). As an exchange, well, they aren't an exchange. 
Vote with your dollars, but for every issue you have at once place there are just as many somewhere else. People will tell you Gox deliberately fudges with the system to encourage transactions, plus the hassle of getting fiat out as well as killer lag.

Bitfloor is supposedly easy to deposit into, but coins are always more expensive on the exchange, and you are stuck there until you convert the fiat to btc.
It looks like almost every way to get money into coins right now has one issue or another. If nothing else that should make you bullish.

Hold on to your coins, unless you are terrified they will be worth zero when you wake up. 
Right now nobody knows what the hell is going on with the market because of the lag. It is impossible to gauge what you can buy or sell for. As I said, that's fine for me because I can live with letting the automated orders through Gox do their thing, timing isn't a huge issue. If it goes through and I'm stuck with cash, cool. If it doesn't and I still have coins, whatever.
This is a very fast way to slowly lose money, though. You sell at $41, it doesnt go back down far enough (or at all) and you have to buy back your same coins for more than you got for them. This is why most market timers inevitably lose. At the same time, BTC can and is manipulated, so you might as well try to get a free ride out of it if you can. 
tl;dr - **No, do not try this at home. Everybody will tell you it is a very stupid idea.**

And don't yell at me for looking to profit off of the people throwing money into the lag monster again (not talking to you, wantrepreneur) if you sell your coins someone has to buy them to keep the price from falling, **speculators and daytraders bring a degree to stability to the system because they stop panic slides and sell into unreasonable bubbles.**

If you put $500 into bitcoins at $30 you would have roughly 16 bitcoins due to fees. If that goes up to $40, you made $160. That's a pretty good ROI. But you could also lose $500. 
Is a quick $160 worth possibly losing $500? Only you know the answer to that. 
@_date: 2013-12-04 03:24:21
That sort of thing is run of the mill, unfortunately. The fact that the money ends up in bitcoins doesn't really matter which is why the Senate hearings (and previous guidance statements) came out like they did. People give money to friends and business partners in an attempt to hide assets all the time. If you can show a transfer of wealth to someone under certain circumstances they have to justify it or pay it back, otherwise it is a fraudulent transfer. 
Whether they put your money into real estate or bitcoins will not change that analysis. If it was done in an attempt to defraud judgment debtors, the transferee (your friend, in this example) will have to return the money.

They lose the ability to be *any* line of legal defense if they have a pecuniary stake in the outcome of the proceedings. 
If I were opposing counsel in a bitcoin case and the EFF tried to get involved, either by representing the person straight up or by filing an amicus brief/intervening, I'd be pounding the table that they should be disqualified since they have a financial stake in the outcome.

They have had issues before. There was an incident in February where they were distributing coins that hadn't been confirmed. This caused a backlog and people started to freak. And then it was all resolved. 
The problem is there have been a lot of scams, and when the price is getting into record territory and there is record amounts of money flying around is the best time to pull a move. I don't think they did that, and it sounds like stuff is starting to flow just like last time. But legit sites have been wiped out before. 
tl;dr - hold your own coins, shit happens. Coinbase is most likely just having technical issues like any other web-based business experiences.

Fortunately it was multiple choice, so after a while we had written down all the answers and were able to play. Huzzah!
I guess my point is there is often nothing more than the illusion of keeping kids out. Sometimes as long as we can say "hey, we tried, those little fuckers were really persistent" it's good enough. Probably not with bitcoin unless it has a ton of "legitimate" uses as well.

I think lied is too strong of a word. As others have said, the situation was much different in 2011 when the forms were filed. I think he erred on the side of avoiding more paperwork and hassles, but what he felt the situation was won't matter. At the end of the day if Gox was converting currencies (even USD - btc - EUR, e.g.) he seems to have misrepresented Gox's business. 
The authorities didn't act sooner because this is a political move. Bitcoin has finally gotten too big to ignore. It isn't going to topple JP Morgan or BoA, but it isn't Alpaca socks and overpriced pizza. This is the beginning of the government's attempt to tackle what it sees as a network for money laundering, among other things. 
The bottom line is the government will happily allow bitcoin to exist - so long as it has control over the system like it does with the banks today. Of course bitcoin ceases to be bitcoin as we know it once that occurs.

Their response is people would have said the same thing back in July 2011 at $30. 
Honestly, I have no fucking clue. I'm scared to take my nut out because shit could be legitimately growing, and we are seeing a lot of news to boost the potential value, but who knows how long people are willing to wait for actual network growth and outlets to develop. That makes me scared to leave the nut in. Frankly I'm a bit paralyzed right now. 
I tried cashing out earlier, but then I instantly found someone willing to sell me coins for less than I just received . . . so of course I bought them and flipped them a few hours later for profit. That's all well and good until you are left holding the bag in an empty room.

They pretty much have pulled the terror funding card, if not fully put it on the table.
The FinCen ruling lets them charge unlicensed brokers with all sorts of financial crimes with roots in 9/11 legislation. Someone busted for brokering bitcoins could easily be charged with the same crimes as people caught wiring money to Al-Qaeda. 
On the other hand, the fact they are showing a way to arguably comply with those laws can be seen as a good thing, which is probably part of the latest surge. Knowing how to dot your I's and cross your T's goes a long way towards confidence.

You can get a declaratory judgment saying it won't be illegal to do something, otherwise people would be forced to break the law (possibly) to find out. 
The EFF doesn't want to do that because then they would be a party to the action, not the lawyers. 
This touches on the conversation that sprung up last time the EFF came up, but I think an actual way for them to do this right would be to go for a Dec action as the attorney for someone else.

The tax rate on capital gains is actually quite small. I think a lot people should consider the cost-benefit analysis. 
For example. even if your joint household income is $130k, which is probably more than the average user, your tax rate on the gains could be 15%. That sounds like a lot, but converting into fiat without leaving a record is going to run you probably 5% for the broker's cut (SWIM, etc). 
So you can pay the government 10% more, which sucks, but you have zero risk of forfeiting assets or spending time in the clink for tax evasion. You also eliminate the risk that your broker will rip you off. 
How much is not going to prison worth? How much is the security of the transaction itself worth? 
That 15% gets smaller if you are in lower tax brackets. 
A lot of the anarcho-capitalists and libertarians will say that any cut to the government is too much and that we shouldn't be cowed or intimidated by their threats. My cost-benefit analysis says otherwise, but that is their, and your, choice to make.

The market cap is the number of coins times their price. We are around 11M coins, so when we passed $92 we hit 1 Billion market cap. 
Yes, there are a finite number of coins. That means at some point the only thing that can change is demand, leading to higher prices (if demand grows).

Hah, thanks, the stocks are an interesting thing I was either unaware of or forgot. But two things still remain:
(1) if the EFF is involved, chances are someone is being charged with a crime related to bitcoins (or is being sued for something bitcoin related, but I doubt the EFF would weigh in for something that popped up in civil litigation). If that's the case, the EFF is going to be in absolutely no position to pitch in if their own hands are dirty from bitcoins. 
More importantly, 
(2) The EFF *almost always* stays above the fray as a matter of policy, for the reputation reasons I've mentioned elsewhere. It is a lot easier to be taken seriously by the court if you can't be painted as "one of them" no matter what the cause is. If the EFF starts accepting "anarco-crypto currency used by drug dealers and pedophiles" it would be that much harder for them to effectively lobby on behalf of bitcoin and the myriad other causes it puts it weight behind. 
These factors have to be weighed against the benefit of the EFF supporting bitcoin before it's even challenged. How much does that even add to the community? In my mind the far greater benefit comes from the EFF waiting on the sidelines to step in as needed. 
As a practical matter I don't think either one will matter when push comes to shove. If the government is going to try to bury bitcoin, the EFF won't be able to stop them. Fortunately I think bitcoin in one form will survive any attempt at regulation.

We are currently in a positive feedback loop. The price goes up, people see the price goes up so they want to buy bitcoins, this causes the price to go up, etc. 
Whether the market price is artificially inflated (i.e., this is a bubble) or the bitcoin is maturing and reaching its "true" value is the subject of much debate. There are plenty of threads in this sub discussing it.

I think some people are understandably misinterpreting my statement. I don't mean "Bitcoin is over, everybody go home", I mean under-ground shady bitcoin as a whole is no longer alive. 
We are seeing the split of bitcoin into that portion of the market that is used "legitimately" (paying taxes, obeying regulations, etc) and that part of the market that has told the government to screw off. 
In a way it has gone from "bitcoin is only used to buy child porn and drugs" to "bitcoin is like cash, it makes it easy to not follow the rules but the rules are still there for you to follow, if you choose." Except, unlike cash, bitcoin leaves a very obvious paper trail unless you know what you are doing.

They do require taxes on barter it's just hard find cheats.
You must pay taxes on all income. The IRS definition of income includes gains from bitcoins. You don't have to pay taxes until the gain is realized (you sold the coins). The income then is the USD amount equivalent to the increase in coin value.
What interests me is what the IRS would do if you tried to claim a loss from selling bitcoins for less than you paid.

The payment processing angle is something I definitely believe in as far as the bitcoin model (although any other competitor could step up and take the same role). Is it guaranteed to be adopted by businesses? No, but if they do it will have a huge impact on the value of a coin. 
We are starting to see that happen now with the processors making it painless for anybody to accept bitcoin and actually receive fiat for less than the cut the traditional card processors take. This is what makes part of me believe the price point and its upwards trend could be supported by actual growth. 
If any proselytizing could be successful without sounding kooky, it would be to vendors and merchants in the terms of saving a percentage of their processor costs with virtually zero pain to set-up. 
tl;dr - yup.

MtGox and Dwolla are definitely *not* the most streamlined and cheapest method to withdraw. 
My advice is to move bitcoins off of the Gox to a wallet and then find a way to dispose of them. That lets you do same day transactions through something like localbitcoins.com if you want and avoids the headache that can come from waiting on Dwolla/Gox transfers. 
@_date: 2013-02-15 21:54:37
I agree with you except for one caveat. The wait time could absolutely murder someone if the market crashes. Purchase today at $27, get your coins worth $15 after it processes, that's going to hurt. 
People should take that into account when they are looking at the costs and fees of the various services. I started with coinbase, but I think at this point if I needed to put more skin in the game I'd go with a more direct route through MtGox.

Also, if they do cancel your order you can resolve the issue through their customer service.

I use both, through blockchain. Do encrypted backups into your Dropbox folder, but give it a real strong password (from the go, a new pw on an old wallet is a security risk). Make sure to keep it fairly up-to-date.
Now you can access your wallet through a browser and also through something like multibit if blockchain goes down. Just make sure you know what you are doing when you do this.
I do that because I'm moving coins around a lot. The real answer is cold storage, just make sure you don't lose or destroy it. Use multiple wallets so you only have to load them as you need them.

I would definitely put some disposable cash into coins, how much depends on your financials and risk aversion. Honestly, I think the money for the jalapeno would have a higher ROI in coins instead.
@_date: 2013-03-26 21:08:08
Buy some coins. That's the hard part. Once you have coins, register on an exchange. Gox has the best volume and generally is used as the standard for price, other exchanges are usually a tad higher in price so are great to sell on but then your USD is stuck and you need to get back to Bitcoin. 
BTC-E is the exception, they have some of the lowest prices but thats because getting USD there is tough. 
Other than that, buy low and sell high, whether it be on the same exchange or by arbitrage from one to another. Don't forget to factor in your fees, which vary from exchange to exchange. On Gox if you do a roundtrip (sell coins, buy them back at a lower price) you are looking at a fee of .6% on both your sale and your purchase. This defines the spread bots/traders will accept. 
If you end up with less coins than you started, you are doing it wrong. 
I don't recommend trying to actively play the swings, but arbitrage is fun and having some fiat on an exchange is great for a flash crash when noobs panic.

Yeah, it had been set up for a month or two and I've used it a number of times. I know a lot of people are worried about losing their money, but I honestly don't think that's going to be an issue. Setting up ACH may take some time, of course. Also, I know more than a few people that never intended to submit any ID or banking docs to BitFloor so this obviously screws up that plan. 
The only thing I'm salty about is the lack of notice. I was caught with my pants down and had zero coins in my account and insufficient depth to convert the money into coins to transfer out even if I wanted to pay the premium to do that. Plus I didn't have another exchange set up. So here's hoping for a nice quiet weekend or even a dip or two so I don't miss the train.

Well, to continue your analogy I'd say they are acting *exactly* like they did with online gambling. The summer of 2006 saw multiple indictments and arrests of individuals engaged in the gambling business before the law was passed that September. 
What we are seeing now isn't too different. A few isolated enforcement efforts coupled with pressure from the private sector is starting to stir things up, there is still plenty of time for them to pass blanket legislation targeting bitcoin. 
There is a distinction, though, because gambling itself is widely accepted to be illegal and a vice. Bitcoin is only an instrument that can be used for vice or illegal activity. Any law is going to have to get cute with the terrorism or drug angle to condemn the entire system. In that case it may be the best possible outcome to have clearly defined steps to follow for compliance under the regulations, but that gets us back to the problem of the bitcoin ecosystem being under the thumb of a government.

Which further drives up the price.

All of the press is nothing but groundless hype pushed by people with ulterior motives. Cyprus? Bull shit.
Nothing fundamentally has changed except for a few "small" things:
1. FinCen guidelines, although much worse than people currently believe, came out the day before the insane hike of the last two weeks. This is what I believe is the biggest actual fuel for growth at the moment. But all they did was signal that you aren't breaking the law simply by using bitcoin, thus causing fence-sitters (and larger actors) to get in. In other words, increased speculation.
2. Increased uses for btc. Reddit, WordPress, etc. This excludes services that only act as btc converting middlemen. Those will have a role down the road, but right now they are merely symbolic. "Hey, use btc, you can pay somebody to buy stuff in USD for you!" Actual use and adoption does not support this price. Hoarding doesn't count, guys.
3. Block reward halving. The rate of new coins was drastically reduced in January. If more people are coming in and less coins, coins cost more. But see points one and two. If new users get bored (or burned), where does the price wind up?
4. Manipulation is steering the price. Everybody cheers when we bust through a wall, but a lot of them were pulled, not bought. Add the bid walls that do the same (notice how fast they.gone when it's time to dump?) and it is easy to feel like a sheep being led down the chute. What happens when they lose control of the market? Even worse, what happens when our shared interest higher prices ceases?
These are just my thoughts. Without legitimate uses for btc all we are doing is cramming money into a market that has little utility. A store of wealth is great, but btc is NOT a store of wealth at this point.
Finally, my newest issue with the market - people are buying coins with absolutely no idea why or what they are doing. It used to be that only a small subset of tech savvy people (or SRers, which used to be a lot harder to use) were involved. Now it feels like we are the cool thing to do, like a fad. Those users will have very short attention spans.

No, the best thing is to have an equal number of bearish speclators as bullish speculators. 
This in theory offsets each other and picks up egregious swings either way, keeping the market at a rational level. 
Speculation can be healthy when it is informed. Unfortunately what we have right now are a bunch of people with absolutely no clue what they are doing playing with rocket fuel.

Yes, and I'm saying your comment is irrelevant to the point of the OP, which is that leverage is always risky. Pointing to one time it worked, in hindsight, doesn't change the risk this time.
Flipping a thousand quarters and getting heads every time doesn't change the odds of the next flip. And I know investing in bitcoins is not flipping quarters, but the statistical point remains the same.

They don't do much more than say "if you don't follow these, we may prosecute you for failing to comply."
The real test will be how a court interprets the laws as applied to bitcoin. Just because the Executive branch thinks the laws mean X, Y, and Z doesn't mean a court will agree. I call not it on being the test case, though.

At one point yesterday we were at $41, it's $46.35 right now. 10% in 24 hours might be stable for BTC but I doubt that is stable anywhere else. 
I've been bearish all weekend and so far its biting me in the ass after closing out sub-45 to try to buy back cheaper, but I still think it's going to slide back down there at some point. All it takes is one dump on the market for a flash-crash and I definitely want cash on hand for that.

Also, not a lot of people can float enough funds to make it worthwhile. If you don't have a lot of savings, tying up a grand in the market for a week or two to make a hundred bucks doesn't seem appetizing.

You have the weekend manipulator at work, plus a shortage of dollars because people have been buying like crazy and nobody has been able to get new money into the system all week (look at all the posts about bitinstant, coinbase, the gox verification queue. etc).
I don't know if this is going to happen for sure, but I wouldn't be surprised if we see a strong bounce back on Monday or Tuesday when money is in the system. Not back to $75, but probably back into the mid 60s.

No. The computation used for mining calculations is the hash per second. That number is basically meaningless if you have to manually transmit your proof of work to the network, unless you could automate it to some degree. 
This of course assumes when you say "powerful machine" you mean one that is actually powerful enough for this purpose. Please don't use air gapped machines for mining, even if it is profitable. That will only end badly.

I'm reassured by the recent trend. The march upwards is much more rational after the two mini dumps. To take a page from the bitcoin crazies, if you plot the growth now it looks consistent because the giant spike that started around $40 has been hammered down.
It's a lot easier to think the current/corrected growth rate is rational growth based on market factors now, but I'm just  a dog on the internet.

The difficulty rises. This means expected payoffs decrease. If your shiny new asic rig is the only one in a sea of gpus, you will be raking in coins because you are a huge percentage of hashing power.
If everybody is on asic, you will be the same percentage of hashing power as they are, but fighting for the same number of coins. People who weren't early to the asic party are going to be very surprised to see what they actually produce.
@_date: 2013-02-22 21:30:11
No, it's because this question is asked in one form or another about four times a day and the answer hasn't changed. 
Difficulty rate is king. Your calculated profit only exists in your head because the difficulty when you receive a miner, even an ASIC rig, is going to be much, much different than what you see today. 
For a nice thought exercise, calculate how much you could have made by taking the money for a mining device and investing it instead in bitcoin last month. For the people who put down $1300 BFL single preorders, they could have turned that same cash into $1950 by cashing coins out today. Granted, things right now aren't exactly representative of the market, but that would also affect mining to a similar degree.
I'm fairly confident that gain is far, far, far above the return the average user will see once they receive their ASIC miners and start hashing.

There is only one thread matching bids and asks. When the market goes nuts it can't keep up.
Also, they just added a new process of verifying funds for queued transactions, increasing the lag.
It hurts because when you place an order in lag you are basically guessing where the price will be once your order hits. This can result in buying or selling wildly off the market price, which in turn can fuel more panic.

I'm shedding coins as we go up, but not at a very fast pace. Every couple of dollars the price goes up since $58 I've been selling a few because I want to lock in some of these profits. Once I hit my break-even point, the rest of the coins are staying put. I also have a relatively low average price, so I'm not exactly ditching coins for $2 gains while we set all time highs.

Close. The walls are open orders that provide the appearance of support, but you can take them down at any time.
With enough coins you could convince the market that is a lot of support, wait for the price to climb as a result, then pull your wall and sell. Without the bid wall a rapid slide and panic can result. When the slide stops, buy cheaper coins. Rinse and repeat.

The red lines on the bottom of the chart represent the number of coins that would have to be purchased to move the price to that point. Tall vertical sections represent a lot of coins, and are called walls. 
Corresponding green walls are the amount of coins sold at that price to move past that level. If you don't have strong green walls a dump can cause a very fast slide in price.

The difference is they would be advocating on behalf of something they themselves were a part of. That means they lose their disinterested status and became a member of the class of affected individuals. 
Your analogy doesn't work because in those cases the method of payment itself isn't an issue. 
For them to be able to weigh in without being biased they can't really say "Oh yeah, bitcoins are totally legit, I mean we took in like a million dollars worth last year."

If you buy and hold, you have no gain to pay taxes on. It gets more complicated when you start using the coins because if you can now get two pizzas with one coin instead if just one pizza, your gained income was one pizzas worth of USD.
It also gets ugly for people trying to play the swings through buying and selling.
Tax issues are very complicated, especially on the frontiers like this.

@_date: 2013-02-28 01:13:54
The problem is the user base might be expanding faster than people are cashing out. A lot of people probably cashed out at $30 after holding coins for a while (look at the bitcoin days destroyed discussions around here) so it is possible that all of the soft money already left the market. 
As long as more people want to buy bitcoins than are cashing out, the price should increase. That's why a lot of people will call it a scam or ponzi scheme, but the fact is if there is something actually supporting demand (like actually having places to spend it) there is no reason the price isn't an actual indication of value.
@_date: 2013-03-23 09:14:53
There is no way to tell what the price is going to stop at until the lag clears. The time of doing anything useful passed about 15 minutes ago.

Because they don't stand a snowball chance's in hell of succeeding. Even if you somehow argue bitcoin is immune to regulation under the commerce clause (good luck, these are the people that said growing potatoes in your own backyard for your own consumption is interstate commerce) there are a million other angles for the Government to claim authority. 
People are confusing the ability of bitcoin to hide and obfuscate transactions with the ability to make them immune to regulation. If the government can prove you were in on some action, they will bust your ass if you try to screw them out of their cut. 
That's just the way the world works.

The difference is gambling is generally illegal. There are no regulations you can comply with to run an online gambling site that complies with US law. They are taking the position it is entirely acceptable to run a bitcoin business, so long as you do it on their terms. Those that fail to comply will be punished appropriately. 
They may no be able to effectively control bitcoin, but they can herd into the dark corners of the internet where its value and utility will be severely diminished until the weak point in the system is addressed. Unfortunately that weak point is the intersection of fiat and bitcoin, which means the banks are involved. There are thoughts on fixing that vulnerability, but they are still a ways off. 
@_date: 2013-03-21 00:58:41

Don't work yourself up. There isn't anything you can do at this point.

I don't think there is any thing that will go through today, the only options I've seen require deposits/checks/wires etc and have processing time. 
Its funny that Coinbase and btcquick are both sold out and now the price is slipping from its high for the day.

Bad luck Brian. Wait a day and they are.back at the door for fifty.
@_date: 2013-02-24 16:05:41
Right. The way I figure is the IRS will see I bought x dollars of bitcoins. At the end of the day I could deposit that amount back into the account (or not at all) and there isn't a whole lot they could say. The only issue in my mind would be depositing more USD than your original withdrawal from coinbase, and that's only an issue if you are trying to avoid taxes.
Otherwise? I spent all those coins on pizza, pound sand.
The fact you purchased coins is, as of yet, not in and of itself illegal. Of course there are people that would prefer even that weren't known.
@_date: 2013-03-06 03:56:10
Hah, sorry but but the last part really sounds like you are begging people to hold firm.
Don't make yourself sound desperate. If it "falls" back to $35 you do realize it will be back to where it was Sunday night? Do we really need to be concerned about that?
If the mere concept of bitcoin decreasing in price just as fast as it increases is enough to shake confidence nobody should have money in it.

Hey, there is a large chance this is in no way related to what you are experiencing, but maybe it is or maybe this will help someone else some day. 
If you created more than one wallet on blockchain and you use the same browser on the same computer, you will only be able to log into one of them because of the way it uses local files. To fix this, delete your cookies. I don't think clearing your cache is necessary, but give that a flush, too. 
Remember, once you log into any wallet after doing this you will be blocked from getting into the second wallet until you repeat the rinse cycle. 
You can use different browsers for each wallet, or just do the smart thing and import them into the same login with blockchain.

Fucking want those coins back now. On the other hand, I cashed out with a nice profit on those coins and have cash on hand if it does plummet back to 15-20. Sometimes repeating these things helps me sleep at night.

I don't think so. The sell wall has been practically non-existent all day, if anything it has actually bulked up a bit at $39.

I cashed out my investment before the crash, leaving some profit as coins.
Don't really care about the price since it's just a number until I cash out coins, which I don't need to do.

If you bolted because you were scared, thanks for playing. Please don't put any more money into the system. If you lost skin trying to do what this guy did, chalk it up to the game. If you think doing this is bad, what the hell do you think would happen to the price if people like this weren't waiting to step in?
Not to call out but if he netted $15k in profit and actually hit both peaks right he bought **$40,000** in coins tonight during the free fall. Seriously, think about what the price would have been if that cushion hadn't been there. 
If you don't know what that means for a market the size of bitcoin, that's 1,000 coins which could roughly move the price up $1.50 right now. Single-handedly. 
Not only do I envy him for pulling off what a lot of us wanted to do, I thank him for doing his part to keep some sanity around here.
@_date: 2013-03-01 01:35:42
Yes. If you bought 2 bitcoins at $10, sold one at $15 and one at $20, you have to report $15 in capital gains. 
Shit gets more complicated if you were playing the swings and bought and sold the same coins repeatedly for profits and losses. 
The IRS doesn't really give a crap where the money came from, it only looks at USD impacts. Similar to how even company cars are quantified as income in some circumstances based on the payment you don't have to make. Saving that amount is the same as if your employer wrote you a check to cover the bill you paid, so they tax it.
