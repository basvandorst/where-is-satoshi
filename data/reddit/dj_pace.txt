I've had it take a day.

What is your investment strategy? 
If the money is potentially needed in the next 3-5 months, sell the bitcoin. Take the loss. And consider it an expensive learning lesson about investing into something with money you can't afford to lose in a space you don't understand nor have tested.
If you can afford to lose the money - just hold. Think long term. If your investment is keeping you up at night and you find yourself checking the price all the time... it's not worth it. No money is worth anxiety. Enjoy your life. If you must sell to do that, sell. It's just money. It's not primary.  Best of luck!

It's a mix of things. I'm the first one to state I don't really know all that much. But I do have a small economic/financial background. Been in the space for a few years now.
I believe in the long term of bitcoin. But we can't think it's this unsinkable ship. I don't think it will sink - but it may get some holes in itself and limp back to port. Just be aware. Bitcoin isn't your saving grace. It might be - but don't be financial stupid just because the past few years have been amazing for it.

1- Be weary of asking for investment advice on reddit.
2- What are your long term plans? Trying to hold for the long term? Or are you trying to make some quick profits on price swings? 
3- What am I doing? Letting it drop/fluctuate. I'm unaware of how the new futures will impact the price. So I sold and took my profits. Depending on what happens after futures are released, I will probably get back in.
Just too much uncertainty for me at the moment. I don't know enough to comfortably forecast what the future holds (who does with bitcoin).
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:37:56
I predict around 3800-4400. Let's be realistic. When prices surge like this, it brings in fresh investors. What are fresh investors after? Quick Profits. Once a small correction takes place, they will sell for profit, and the price will tumble back down. I'm not saying it's going to hit sub 2k or anything. But near 3k isn't unrealistic. 
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:37:44
It's weird how it stays somewhat steady for a while, then bam, major jumps. I guess that momentum just builds up and releases. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:27:58
Some serious gainz.
@_date: 2017-08-19 15:34:01
What people *think* is what drives the price.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:51:42
It's always better to wait for the dip. But the question is, when does the dip occur? How extreme will it be? At the dip, will you still have faith in bitcoin? What if you 'buy the dip' and it keeps going down?
Make a plan and stick to it. If your plan is always evolving and changing with the most recent news and mood, you're an emotional investor and you will end up losing money in the long run. Don't try to make millions. No one ever went broke making a profit. Be wise. Some profit is better than large risk and loses.

The guy who sold this knew he can charge a higher price if he wrote something about BTC on it 5 minutes before he sold it. Lol
In all seriousness, if any BTC is on there. You are one lucky son of a gun.
@_date: 2017-08-12 17:34:52
Anyone who thinks this isn't going to correct in the near future is foolish. I'm all for the moon. But even spaceships have to orbit for a while. You waste all your gas going straight up. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:53:42
Usually we see stair like descents. It's not a straight downward slope, but a trend downward. People buy low, and then sell for small profits. Pushing the price lower, and the process continues until non day traders get nervous. Enter FUD. Enter Psychology. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:59:34
I think the dip is coming. I mean, how can it go up so fast with no correction? Will it go sub 2k? Probably not. Sub 3k? Maybe.
At the end of the day, it's all speculation. Make a plan and don't be swayed by emotion and hype. If you're in this for quick profits, you're going to end up losing eventually. Just be careful.
@_date: 2017-08-01 04:27:56
View it as you would any investment. Do you have a 401k? Any other type of investment that your small contributions would work better for? BTC is highly volatile, and despite what people say, the future is unknown. It could crash tomorrow. 
Do I think BTC will continue to rise at a steady rate over the long term? I do. Not astronomical rates. But steady. But my 401k is continuing to rise at a steady rate too.
Bitcoin isn't a get rich quick scheme, it's not the answer to all your problems. It, like anything else, is an investment. It's risky. 
I'm not saying don't do it. I'm just saying, weigh your options. Maybe another investment is better for you?
@_date: 2017-08-18 20:04:10
@_date: 2017-08-13 01:53:16
Yeah it is, it appears to be going down now. I think a lot of people made some decent profits on the extreme volatility tonight, and are getting out. 
@_date: 2017-08-18 21:32:43
Why be a dick? Someone is trying to understand how exchanges work. Useless comments like this prove the stupidity of it's author more so than people inquiring about genuine questions do.
@_date: 2017-08-18 19:31:14
There are a lot of people that want to, 'snatch cheap btc'. But, with everyones gauge of what 'cheap' is being different, we may see it go lower as people want to see how cheap they can get it for.

My wallet is open, by the electrical outlet near the chair...
@_date: 2017-08-03 19:57:25
It's already going up...
@_date: 2017-08-17 03:21:17
Interesting to see the price dropping so fast at the moment. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:18:30
It's looking interesting... haha. 
Edit: Can't get back into gdax now...
@_date: 2017-11-29 20:01:02
I sold last night around 10,400 and bought at 9000.00 on the dot.
I literally just got off work, headed home. Plopped down about to take a quick nap, decided to check bitcoin...and saw it diving. Haha. 
Kept trying to get gdax to work, since it was down. 
It's just a ride, please don't gamble here like you aren't gambling. It's a ride. Up. Down. Don't panic, and we will be ok. You lose money when you panic. 
EDIT: Have a plan, take proifts. Don't try and time the market perfectly. You will get burned. We all knew 10k was too high too fast. I didn't try and wait until the tip of Everest to sell, I took profits. No one ever went broke taking profits. I didn't sell 100%, just some. Why?
Because it's all speculative. Bitcoin isn't a money making tree. It's a market. Run by people's emotions. As we just saw, fear is real. Fear of missing out (push to 11k) - fear of losing money (flash crash to 8.6k). Want to sleep at night? Don't put 50+% of your portfolio into bitcoin. 
Life is more than money. 
@_date: 2017-11-29 19:22:16
Yeah - it's offline. I also heard Gemni was down too...

Your product looks interesting... but your website is literally awful. Want to see better sales? Take some high-res shots of your product. Reformat your website. See ' for a great example.
Do something to make it look like you're a professional. If you don't have a professional looking website, why should I believe you have a professional product?
You'll get more business. I promise. 
@_date: 2017-11-20 19:17:29
While this is most likely true, fear and risk are not logical. We need to be smart about thinking this is the original Titanic. It can sink.
@_date: 2017-11-20 04:44:24
Very true. The thing about rides like this, is if it ever crashes and goes to 0. And never goes back up. We will all feel like idiots. So, just be aware. We aren't the exception to the rule. 
@_date: 2019-12-10 00:33:39
How did you find this rare futuristic picture of 2020?
@_date: 2017-09-19 05:29:43
A book called Digital Gold. 
This book gives you more of a history behind bitcoin, how it started, what some of the hurdles were...etc. You'll better understand bitcoin because of it. It's not technical, but it does explain some things.
Excellently written.

Somethings going on, it just dropped 150$ in 1 minute.

Please for the love of God... don't do this. Let's be realistic. Do I think BC will continue to grow? Yes. Am I going to bet my financial security on it? No. 
Never. Please don't.

It's price manipulation at it's best from the miners. Don't be fooled, please.
@_date: 2017-07-21 03:32:44
You don't think the miners held off from signaling to cause a panic about the fork? Knowing the price would drop? Then bought at the dip, then signaled and watched as the prices sky-rocketed as the market flooded with confidence because of the signaling? 
This is a market run by the big boys. If you don't think so, you're mistaken.
@_date: 2017-07-10 15:56:54
1,000?  What?
Why do you think it will crash so much?
@_date: 2017-05-05 20:12:43
What are some of the blockers you see in Bitcoin that will be a stumbling block for wave 3 investors? (general public)
