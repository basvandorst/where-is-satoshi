How come?

Serious? It's that easy? Thanks!

Thanks mate

Thanks mate. You are so knowlegable. Obviously the usability of an app means no one, but highly intelligent people like you can trade bitcoin. Now, go to the Rick and Morty sub and stop people who are not your level of intelligence from watching it.

How come? Honestly curious

Bitcoin is only useful to trade now due to it's volitility. I personally do not believe it will takeover traditional currency.
However it's acceptance in society is solid and I believe long term there will be inflation in its value. Buy now. Hodl till retirement.

Where do you live that stocks are being taken away by the government?

Such a good word for this sub: hyperbole

Any analysis is a guesstimate. No matter how educated, knowledgeable or deep into the sector no one can ever say for certain where something will go (excl insider trading).

Or that the stock market is trillions and if only Bitcoin is 5% of that it will be worth $1m a coin. It just has too!!

Yeah 1917 is so transferable to today. Buy Bitcoin but don't he an idiot fanatic. Capitalism will continue.
@_date: 2019-12-15 04:23:48
Yeah I know right? No shit. QE is happening surprise fucking surprise.
Hyperbole this whole fucking sub. The mind is based that Bitcoin will take x% of x% sector because "it just has to"

It's not linked to anything tangible nor does it have a benchmark. It's a complex system that by far has one of the lowest barriers for entry (stock market is incredibly hard to pick who to invest with). It's driven purely by speculators and to add it doesn't pay dividends.
I believe long term it'll have a solid value due to the above
