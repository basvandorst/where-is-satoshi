That’s a good idea.  It would be a terrible thing for the technology bitcoin is depending on to be ruled illegal.  It’s also a little concerning that this issue hasn’t been brought up more by the community leaders.

That’s a great point.  Others have had good feedback as well.  I wish there was a concrete answer so that we could be 100% all the work going into lightning won’t be ruined by money transmitting regulations.

Trezor is the best!  Thank you
@_date: 2017-12-16 16:29:05
I love bitcoin but something needs to be done now, or the bitcoin energy consumption will become unsustainable.  The core developers need to start addressing this ASAP so a solution can at least be in discussion.  If we wait too long and bitcoin keeps growing exponentially, we will have a huge mess.  Bitcoin improvements take years, time to fix is now.

Agree.  We need a scaling solution ASAP.  Fees are scaring the market away.  It’s a shame Segwit adoption is not in the 90% by now and people aren’t using the scaling upgrade appropriately.

Agree.   Need a solution ASAP.  People rushing to shit coins because bitcoin can’t keep up.  Push Segwit!  It’s sad Segwit is not being adopted by the big players In the space.  I hope lightning saves the full blocks problem.  It needs to be done now!  It’s not FUD, it’s a real problem.   Also we need to start looking into ways to help lower the power consumption issue.

I’m not sure.  If it’s a large amount then it probably will be reported. I don’t know what the threshold is.  Problem is amplified if you waited a long time between purchase and movement to hardware wallet. 
@_date: 2017-12-19 07:40:07
It's not a question if you should report it.  It's a problem that the guy you bought the gold from is telling the IRS you sold it, even if you just switched pockets.

Bitcoin is gold.  Lightning is coffee.

Crypto represents hope and dream of financial freedom that the big nations have stolen from us by devaluing our currencies.  The younger generations have not had the opportunity to see the American Dream, only sky rocketing housing prices and a difficult time making ends meet.  So yes, people want to dream.
@_date: 2017-12-14 12:34:38
Great story!  Glad you are doing well.  If you have the means, I recommend you use some of your gains to purchase health insurance, so if you have health issues again you will have even more financial security

I agree but from their standpoint moving btc off their wallets is sale.  They don't know if you sold it another party or what you did with it.

I find the Trezor to have better support, easier to split coins, open source is a plus too
@_date: 2017-12-14 13:08:43
I suspect that once bitcoin market cap reaches approximately the gold market cap, more money will leave usd and traditional asset classes, leading to a global financial crisis.  So it won't cause a crisis in the next 6 months, but perhaps in late 2018 or 2019.  Things are going to get interesting!  HODL

Where is a good chart to see Segwit percentage?  Where is that chart from this post?  Thanks 
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:43:52
Yes but if the IRS sees us all as non compliant when in fact we are, it is still an issue that needs to be looked into
@_date: 2017-12-01 16:51:23
Great viewpoints from non-crypto financial experts.  Thank you!  Awesome to see mainstream people talking about bitcoin in a positive manner!

Fallout?  I liked it the old way.  Jimmy Song has good point from a software engineer viewpoint, but I don't think he is a very good conversation moderator.  Things changed when Thomas Hunt went to Europe, maybe they ran into scheduling timing issues and it led to a fallout.  Something is up.
@_date: 2017-12-01 17:00:15
Depends if people flee the market and run to crypto or run to cash.  This will depend on the timing.  If it crashes today then btc will probably go down.  As btc becomes more mainstream a stock market crash may result in people rushing for btc
@_date: 2017-12-08 04:38:16
I suspect that this forum is representative of the new bitcoin holders in general, which makes the rapid rise in price worrisome.

Trust this guy.  He makes redundant “very very very” statements.  He uses the word “like” to begin a sentence.  He uses run-on sentences (2nd paragraph).  
He can’t calculate.  The size of a pizza is related to the square of the diameter.  Pepper Jack (he is not Jesus) probably wonders why a 16” pizza costs more than twice the price of an 8” pizza and is afraid to buy a pizza because of this.  
He is a redditor for 6 weeks.  His fears are irrational.  His analogy sucks.  He’s wrong about OP educational background.  But trust him.  ��
RemindMe! One Year “this guy sucked”
@_date: 2017-11-16 11:49:27
Great point!  Then we’re going to 100k sooner than most realize.  I suspect within the next 1-2 years many investment portfolios will be 1% bitcoin and this will skyrocket the price.

@_date: 2017-11-30 12:31:48
This is quite possible.  Money leaving stocks and going into crypto will push prices down and lead to stock FUD.  Stocks way overvalued.  Stocks tank, btc rises.  Will be interesting to witness the revolution!

Time for a Trezor T
@_date: 2017-11-05 22:58:31
You can use a pass phrase so that the seed is useless until you add the pass phrase.  Trezor has this functionality.  Keep the seed phrase in one or more secure locations and the passphrase in 1 or more secure locations.   That way you have redundancy and security in that you need access to two separate secure physical locations in order to access your coins.  Plus you are protected against fire or flood.  Make sure someone you trust knows the plan in case you are injured or worse.
@_date: 2017-11-27 04:00:19

I have 2 Trezors, 2 Ledgers and a KeepKey
KeepKey wins on ease of use but loses terribly on customer support
Ledger and Trezor win for great customer support and Trezor wins again for being open source.
My vote is for Trezor overall although their hardware could be more elegant.  Maybe version 2 will be more visually appealing.  
Can’t go wrong with Ledger they’re great too.

You might be exactly right but to me it’s easier to invest in the Bitcoin technology than a social media company.  The stock market is long overdue for a correction.  I do own some Facebook but IMO the upside for BTC at this time is much greater than for Facebook.  HODL Facebook, HODL Bitcoin tighter!

It’s great to have a balanced portfolio but Bitcoin appreciates so much faster than traditional assets one is stuck with the choice to rebalance the portfolio each year vs letting BTC grow to be the main asset.  I haven’t seen much discussion on portfolio rebalances with bitcoin.  
@_date: 2017-10-26 03:14:06
As BTC grows in value I will split my coins up into various wallets.  But it’s not needed I’m just a little paranoid and want to make sure I’m using the best wallet.  If there’s a bug found in one I can easily move funds to a wallet that is not affected.  Plus I like the tech and wanted to try each one.  Definitely not needed but not a bad idea.
@_date: 2017-10-27 02:20:59
