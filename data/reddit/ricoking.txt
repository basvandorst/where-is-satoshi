ecommerce website here. Stripe is fucking awesome. This is huge for me and I am fucking so excited. Think about all the ecommerce sites that can now accept bitcoin, especially sites like shopify who run thousands and thousands of online shops

I don't see why everyone's getting angry at me.im not a huge seller but I've probably shipped over 10k packages internationally. To sell internationally you literally stick an extra sticker on your package and that's it.  Yall over complicating shiz.

You sir are stupid. Really...a dark carpark. So fucking stupid mate. It's a lesson you will learn.
@_date: 2014-02-12 17:56:16
Yea well selling your ps3 in a dark parking lot is fucking stupid too

I am a vendor on etsy that accepts any crypto. Yea its annoying that I have to do the sales manually with wallet address but I get it done. I have actually done quite a few sales but all with dogecoin. 
I've not sold anything with bitcoins yet because well...I am selling apple stuff haha
My sales would definitely increase if cryptos were accepted. Literally jizz my pants.
@_date: 2014-03-17 21:35:21
People will hate on dogecoin around these parts but the real story is that it is attracting loads more people into crypto. Dogecoin was my first coin I wanted to get into, because of dogecoin I now have bought a couple of bitcoins and have used it as a currency. I also included bitcoin as a payment for my business all because dogecoin got me into bitcoin. really need to stop hating on it because it is making people like me love and use bitcoin too. I think dogecoin is really important for bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-11-29 16:36:46
Depends what your countries customs tax is. Easily looked up. It's up to the buyer if they want to buy it or not... 
I don't even run a website I sell through etsy.com. Pretty much all shop owners sell worldwide
@_date: 2014-02-23 02:47:02
Doesn't dogecoin actually have more people using it than bitcoin?

3 btc here. Forget about it. We took the gamble. Could of been an awesome gamble but this time we lost. Our time will come. 
We are trying to be successful by trying different things. It was money better spent than pissing it away with alcohol or something. 
All thats happened is that our balls have got larger and are waiting for our next journey. Our time will come!
@_date: 2014-02-04 22:07:44
We support all currencies and don't bash other's even if they bash us. Your are being unshibish and your attitude is burning our fuel to the moon. This is not having a sense of humour it's being a douche.
@_date: 2014-04-27 20:52:20
You talked about employees and tax. I answered both. Your downvotes show I was correct and my upvotes show I was correct.
@_date: 2014-04-26 23:10:06
1. Employees are not forced to work for them. Also people bitch too much about work, just get on with it. He was getting paid £6.50 thats above minimum wage here.
1. They are avoiding the tax legally. Every CEO does it because if they didn't their competition would have an edge. If it's legal then why wouldn't you. CEO's are not there to do what is morally correct. They are there to make money.
Look I am agains't the whole tax avoidance thing too and agree everyone should pay what they are supposed to pay. People blame businesses for avoiding tax but it's not their fault, it's the Governments fault.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:20:24
Wait...where do you buy their shares
@_date: 2014-05-10 00:13:01
I used to sell raffle tickets in the airport to win like Lamborghinis. We actually had them sitting infront of us all day. When the company started they used hot girls to ring in guys to buy tickets for it. A new sales manager came in to the company and got rid of all the girls and hired sales professionals rather than hot girls to sell tickets. The revenue increased dramatically and turned the company around. From my experience using hot girls is not useful to sell your product. People just want to chat and state at them rather than caring what the hell they are promoting

Sorry to say this. I prefer their layout. I also like that they have added a volume chart. Theirs just seem more clean. Maybe you should look into redesigning your site. Hopefully that's a little criticism you can take on board :)

He is meaning that Mt.gox is the largest powerhouse of bitcoin just like JP Morgan is a huge player in the banking world. He is not comparing their market caps. Dumbass
@_date: 2014-04-03 21:41:00
Yeh he's advertising... Who cares! It's a win win for everyone.
@_date: 2014-02-23 03:33:14
Yea sorry I explained it wrong. Your correct. Well that just shows even further the grounds dogecoin is making in just 2 months  having that many transactions per day. If bitcoin wants to have a future it has to have more transactions rather than just people hoarding. The truth is I hoard my bitcoins but I actually spend my dogecoins. Time will tell
@_date: 2014-07-17 09:44:47
I thought we were all full time bitcoin traders.
@_date: 2014-02-27 03:57:06
Even if I don't make money and it doesn't work out at least I tried to push this coin further

import taxes are paid by the customer. Ok if you are sending like a sword or gun to a country then fair enough.. you cant do that to every country 
@_date: 2014-02-23 03:05:10
Dogecoin has more transactions per day than bitcoin. Not taking sides here but I think dogecoin has a chance in the future as the baby to bitcoin. Almost the beginners tool to get used to crypto currencies.
@_date: 2014-04-03 06:28:15
but i.. oh ok..
@_date: 2014-07-12 20:22:58

Couple cryptos. I just keep hearing bitdazzle so I thought I would ask

I am actually in the UK so thats why I ship so many international. I ship more outside my country than in. I guess were both new and had success pretty fast, both in the sublimation game(nightmare when you first start out and your the biggest noob trying to figure out how to print). If there's any advice I would give you is that don't try and open too many businesses at once. I have 7 and apart from etsy I am on ebay and noths. I live a life without sleep, but I move to my warehouse January and I have custom build my machines to spit out more products so maybe jan we can sort some shit out. But mate your killing it in sales too, I take my hat off to you. I am actually planning on making tshirts too but I am doing it the cut and sew way with a roller press, was able to get a demo on one, was sweet. Do you actually print them out yourself or are you drop shipping. 
Also you got any advice for me haha?
