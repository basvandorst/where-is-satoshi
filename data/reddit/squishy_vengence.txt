That's easy, just don't show that. 
@_date: 2015-06-30 04:09:58
Charts like this sell bitcoin.  I'm surprised the far right hasn't seized on bitcoin as the new gold.  Need to make it easier to buy I suppose.
@_date: 2015-06-30 16:28:35
Probably true, thanks for your input.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:27:07
Thanks I will do that!
@_date: 2015-06-30 05:04:03
What about selling physical bitcoins good for one bitcoin with QR code on the side?  That way you don't actually have to give them any money unless they get a bitcoin wallet.  Then get Glenn Beck to sell the crap out of it.
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:26:42
Thanks man!  
@_date: 2015-06-22 16:26:51
Thank you for your consideration!
@_date: 2015-05-11 17:32:47
Well I'll go with linear and hope for exponential

He's still a dink
@_date: 2015-05-02 03:55:09
Who cares? 
@_date: 2015-01-15 03:53:09
The massive price reduction.  I figure it's worth a shot to dabble.

Just set-up a circle account.  Thanks!  Appreciate the time and advice.

Just be patient it's common for small funds to be held while adding a card or bank account.
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:58:35
So what do you use? 
@_date: 2015-01-29 03:46:41
Thanks I learned some things
@_date: 2015-01-15 05:21:47
Wow thanks! 
@_date: 2015-01-15 02:46:47
A pack a gum!  You were lucky...
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:19:15
So its 100% faith?  I prefer to be educated personally.
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:57:53
This is what I don't get.   You guys all want people to buy bitcoin, but then you're all arrogant twats to people with legitimate questions about bitcoin.  The whole exclusive nerd community thing isn't going to fly if you want this to be more mainstream.
@_date: 2015-08-24 23:18:47
What the fuck does that even mean?  How do you know without asking questions and learning.  I bought btc, I subscribed to r/bitcoin, I real articles, I watch online videos, etc.  Bitcoin is confusing.  Doesn't mean you need to be snark to every question people have.
@_date: 2015-08-24 20:38:19
Looks like I have 3 new resources I can go study.  Wasn't that much better than being an arrogant twat?
@_date: 2015-08-05 17:50:26
Right so they'll send a multi thousand dollar drone to deliver my dime bag?  I call horse shit.   The technology is nowhere near ready.
@_date: 2015-08-24 17:14:54
That's why I'm asking questions about it because I want to understand it beyond the price.  And again with the arrogant nerd answer.
@_date: 2015-08-19 03:26:02
Holy shit!   Thanks for synopsis.   This is bitcoin's issue.   I'm a technical guy and I still had very little clue what you were talking about, but I get the overall concept. 
@_date: 2015-08-24 16:44:02
Is there some kind of proof of a massive Chinese BTC sell-off?

But L doesn't spell Pound either?
@_date: 2015-07-30 15:08:37
Last I checked a euro was a $1.10.  Where is the article getting it's conversion numbers?
@_date: 2015-08-07 16:20:49
That's actually a really good baseline.  When I get socks by drone one day I'll think of this.
@_date: 2015-07-30 19:17:31
Mystery unfolded.  Thanks
@_date: 2015-07-30 16:16:53
Ahh, good call.  They very intelligently chose to use an E for their currency the "British Pound" I guess to throw off all the yanks.  Currently it's $1.56 pounds per dollar, so that's probably about right.
@_date: 2015-04-22 03:47:10
Yay millions of our tax dollars going to their new fancy building so they can bribe company's to sell our privacy! 
@_date: 2015-09-14 18:25:57
Does this same CEO get charged every week or am I missing  something?  Every week it's a post about this guy and something about Japan.  Ugh.
@_date: 2015-04-15 01:11:51
To be honest the volitility and low price is what attracted me as a very recent bitcoin owner.  I figure the price is low enough that bitcoin will either die and I'll lose my few $1000 now or I'll sit on it for 20 years and....Fuck bitches?
@_date: 2015-09-03 05:21:41
Right because it's so easy for Syrians fleeing murder to bank all their extra cash into bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-04-12 17:04:31
So sad for him.

Takes a few weeks to add your card to circle
@_date: 2015-04-25 01:51:59
Makes me want to open a strip club that takes bitcoin.  I'd get a shit ton of women interested in bitcoin then! 
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:15:00
This seems like some straight up good advice.  I know I don't want to look back and wish I could have ridden some historic rise from a small investment.  Or I could lose a few K trying out this new form of currency.  
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:00:38
15 seconds to sell Bitcoin?  I have circle so buying bitcoin is not my problem.  But if I need some cash this seems to be the difficult thing to do quickly/easily.
@_date: 2015-11-04 01:12:31
The same thing on circle. Would love help with this question too.  I've looked at wallets and they just seem sketchy.  What if my wallets on-board memory fails?  What if the companies behind the wallet apps or online wallets suddenly disable the app and online access?
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:49:52
Upboat this.   This is truth. 
@_date: 2015-03-01 22:20:44
Honest question.  Why would a major retailer feel compelled to take a new kind of currency like bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-03-25 06:22:25
Interesting product of living in the future.   Can't all bitcoins be tracked?  I mean I know they are supposed to anonymous,  but I'm sure the NSA can tell.
@_date: 2015-03-24 03:59:58
I always wonder that myself.  Just looking at sp500 and upcoming election, I have a feeling we're due.
@_date: 2015-10-05 18:02:25
Yeah I probably will just use Mycelium or localbitcoins next time.  Really didn't like giving some random company my ID, email, phone number, etc for a supposedly more discrete form of currency.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:40:01
I think you're right.  That name sounds familiar.
@_date: 2015-03-22 17:29:42
While this is awesome I bet it would lead to some serious overpayment while visiting third world countries.  We'll need to come up with some sort of poverty level value conversion for bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-03-10 02:56:50
Because think of all those Internet points! 
@_date: 2015-03-18 23:51:49
Not panicking, just curious what causes fluctuations in bitcoin price. 
@_date: 2015-10-14 01:49:01
I agree, but it makes me nervous I'll forget something and be fucked.  Plus just seems too easy to transfer to mycelium for example.  Something about the ease is off putting for some reason.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:40:54
Agreed, but strippers, street weed dealers, and casino's aren't taking bitcoins just yet.
@_date: 2015-10-05 16:38:52
Everyone who says this has only trying buying bitcoins.  If you try selling bitcoins and have a fantastic experience I'd be surprised based on the comments.
@_date: 2015-03-30 05:22:35
Good luck to you.   Either you'll be really happy or really sad. 
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:17:53
Vegas, slow system response time, too much identification required, text, email, then where it should have given money it just did nothing.
@_date: 2015-10-05 03:32:48
May as well have. Complete opposite of what I thought bitcoin experience was supposed to be about.
@_date: 2015-02-13 07:14:02
Fascinating thanks! 
@_date: 2015-02-14 18:58:08
So cool!  I jiuuust did the same thing and on circle too!
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:21:40
I thought the whole point of a bitcoin ATM was to scan a few Barcodes and boom cash.  Instead it wanted my ID, a picture of me, email, had to make account, got messaged a pin, confirmed account.   Then where it finally should have let me withdraw money it frustratingly seemed to be stuck.  To compound stress my phone was dying.
@_date: 2015-10-05 06:19:03
Vegas atm.  Too much ID required, usernames needed, etc.  Then in the end it simply never provided the ability to withdraw money. 
@_date: 2015-02-14 00:09:56
What about circle?
@_date: 2015-02-21 04:02:47
Bitcoin is cool, but buying stuff online will always be fun regardless.

Not having to go to their store, find parking, or look at their scabby faces is worth +15% to me.
