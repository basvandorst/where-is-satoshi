There was no bad loans? They sold loans taken out by people *with no income* as AAA to third parties. That's fraud. Are you a shill or just ignorant?

Stringing up bankers might make them think twice before they fuck with little people.

So Iceland didn't jail bankers? You're a liar and a moron.

Bankers were jailed in Iceland. That worked.

So nothing else to say fuckhead? Duh. You fucked up by calling me a tool when I was right. Read the fucking reports as to why these people were jailed in Iceland for yourself. It's there in black and white. They were criminals. Politicians were complicit, especially in the US where they let these people off, but it's a crime to sell garbage as AAA rated investment. God, no wonder the US economy is fucked with people like you believing it's just part of business to defraud people.

So keep 30% in the bank on paper, don't just write it off or steal it.

So the bankers in the US, who got away with all of the fraud and selling bad loans as AAA weren't to blame for any of it; it was all politicians? 
The bankers in Iceland were jailed for *crimes* including fraud and market manipulation, not just because they were scapegoats. The Icelandic politicians did their fucking job, not like the US and Europeans who are bought by the banks.
Call me tool you fuckwit? You got your info from Wikipedia, which is used as a propaganda tool, and you think bankers don't deserve to be locked up for what they did.
