well you can say anything is bulshit guessing, if you want to.
Market analysis? Volume? Interest? Who cares, it can be true or not isnt it?
You better change you btc for corn thats something you at least can eat, because the "value of btc is what people put on it , its not real". . Isnt what you people say? 
Guess what you are wrong and price will hit 2000+ till the end of the year because a lot of people believe btc worth more than dollar

the answer to why btc will hit 1800 this week is on the text itself.
A well done study of the market seems legit to me.
For the experts, well define expert to me.
If someone in really into a subject , right now, he is expert enough to me, until he loses interest and dont dedicate more time into the subject, then he is not expert anymore. What is expert to you? Someone who writes at forbes? Sorry these guys are totaly lost now, welcome to the internets, anyone can be an expert, and i am not being ironic.

by my definition one who is into btc trade, can be a btc trade expert.
By your definition, one who is into btc can be a tea expert/or whatever.
By my definition someone who is into homeopathy can be an homeopathy expert.
By your definition any pile of shit can be your caviar.
Check matte bro, i am the boss and you ate lost.
