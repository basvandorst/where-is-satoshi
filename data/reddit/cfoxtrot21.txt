This is nothing. It’s for 2013 to 2015. In 2020 the accountability limitation of 7 years for financial bookkeeping lapses for data in 2013. It’s the IRS just making sure they get theirs. 
The most interesting piece is the cap of $20,000 in a single transaction for that time period. Not a lot did that, particularly in 2013-2015.

So here’s what you do. You kids get yourselves a money clip. You can get these at any haberdashery. You put your LTC Address in the money clip. Then, when a guy flashes a blade, you go, “You want my money? Go get it!” Then you run the other direction
Street Smarts!
