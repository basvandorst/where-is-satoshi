Even though i agree with the first part you said but bringing up current general aspects of  macroeconomy does not enlight us either. It is also just a way to describe the current situation with voodoo like methods. Economy is no science.

I also did that. Saw some videos about that on youtube. Now I'm trying to hold on to it. So I get more energy to do the things which need that amount of energy input. :)

Btw do you guys know if 'they' are working on updates to decrease transaction costs etc? 
I'm not sending my btc often. But when i do. Lol i feel like i need to sell my organs.

I have the exact mindset. A few months ago when I was studying I was working on a book to create an ideology. It is more or less about the question of property, death and it's influence in modern days, the fourth industrial revolution and money and why I would get rid of it. 
Now I'm trading because I'm not that bad at it. Plus I need money to survive. Just as everyone else does. But if there will be an economic crisis - I'll free the people from their imaginary chains. There will be no more useless, dumb consumerism, no waste of fresh food and no plastic. Plus modernization will economically be the main focus. Socially it will be like that: Give when you can, take when you need. This is the principle people in the rainforest live with and it is the only way human species survived as a whole.
The thing is, I feel trapped about what I want and what I need. I've had many bad expirience with people and I'm turning into a misanthrop.
Sorry but i had to get rid of that. :D

Right, with that attitude bitcoin is doomed. Once there's a dump people will leave btc and it will remain the symbol of cryptospace. Unfortunately, bitcoin is more driven by financial aspects than ideology. But the succes of bitcoin comes from that financial aspect. If nakamoto had an (good/evil) plan by introducing bitcoin. He perfectly adapts it on society.
I do also believe it will rise but I'm pretty sure that it also can be easily replaced if we talk bout tech and progress. What ultimately makes me concerned.

By buying btc?
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:58:06
1. No, I didn't make any recommendations.
2. Take a philosophy class if you want to detect "Ad hominem" arguments. Since there is no such thing involved.
3. Still, no recommendation. Only implications from your side.
4. Right, my post offers no value. Did I want it to have value? Another implication by yourself? Who knows?
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:22:44
'Sounds a bit like' seems a bit too much like - wait a second - your opinion?
Didn't say it. You cannot keep up your claims.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:32:24
Exactly, btw I said it's on sale. Not that you have zo buy. The rest is implication. Just like people reduce things on black friday even though the price hasn't been changed much.

I've been starting to learn trading in january with stock markets. Since august im trading crypto. Do you have some sort of strategy how to make more out of your investment? I think im nearly in the same position as you. Im mostly trying to accumulate more and more btc ltc etc by trading. Since i thought that this might be the right way to go. It was a little hard at first. But now im finally able to make like a monthly payment (if a trade works out) with what im currently investing. :)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:19:03
So, am I supposed to let the thread I started alone? Alright. I'm able. I just don't need to since you can't hold up your claims. 
You say the post had a salesman tone. Good for you. I didn't delete anything. Maybe a mod. But if you could recall it. It would've made the talk a bit less speculative.
@_date: 2017-11-27 02:47:21
I seem not to be able to edit the title anymore, thanks though.*
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:26:47
It is. You we're claiming that I do want people to buy btc. I don't. Atleast I didn't write it. Case closed.
Maybe it was intended. Maybe not. You will never know. 
Reality really is complex, right? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:13:31
Is it salesman talk? Can't anyone else say it, too? Am I a salesman? Questions, Questions.
It is. Why it is that way. I already said above.
Btw I said don't try to embarass yourself. Is that an attack? Or the first recommendation in this nonsense thread?

I began trading coins in August. Did some stock market before. I wish I bought Antshares in April but well. There are still some opportunities. :-) 
Crypto in general is exciting. Let's see what will come for us in the future. Good luck! :-)
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:28:16
None. I just have clear mind. We live until we die. Nothing else to say.
@_date: 2017-11-27 00:59:22
I agree somewhat. I am lucky that i was able to make some money in the cryptospace (unfortunately not in btc) but when i sell litecoin ill instantly buy into btc. :)
Btw. 10k could be coming overnight already/writing from europe
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:40:38
I'm only editing things I wrote wrong in an orthographic way. Nothing else. Lol
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:43:23
I'm not recommending anything. Don't you get it? I said BTC is on sale. Nothing more. Are we in school or what? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:36:34
I recommend you to read stuff the way it is written - do not make any other assumptions and/or implications. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:46:44
Lol are you serious? Please do not try to embarass yourself any longer, thanks.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:29:49
No, I'm telling people to free them from financial slavery.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:35:17
Did I?
@_date: 2017-11-27 03:14:06
Dude, i was too excited I already edited it in the heat of the moment. Lol but it's fine. It was too overwhelmimg to see the 300 billion market cap lol
@_date: 2017-11-29 21:12:37
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:06:21
Did I?
I said it is on sale, that's right. I didn't say anything indirectly. That's what language does in communication between 2 individuals by saying the word "sale". You assume rather then acknowledge.
That's a good suggestion. I will think of that once I want people to buy into btc.
I'm less interested in telling random people how our reality works. So what? Can I avoid it? No. People keep saying whatever they want.
@_date: 2017-11-29 06:16:30
In this case that friend is my mum. lol
@_date: 2018-02-21 09:53:31
And then you did not care what happenend to it? Or when did you start to reenter (atleast to see how it is doing?)
@_date: 2018-02-21 15:27:44
Alright. Well I hope you didn't do bad there either! (: maybe not as good as you would've done with btc but hopefully you could make some money with it. (:

@_date: 2018-02-20 16:56:07
I wonder why I have never heard of BTC before 2017. :/
Normally, I'm very enthusiastic in learning about underground things/future tech. Also, I was the first from all my friends to learn about it so i had noone who could have told me about it. 
Nonetheless, think of your first crypto-investment and tell me if you sold too early. If yes do not regret missing out on so much money. 
@_date: 2018-02-21 10:04:22
Well, it depends on what you think is young. In 2013 I was 16 years old lol. I do read lots of newspaper or read in general but I feel like the news magazines in europe didn't care about BTC. Must've been more of an American news thing, no?
Luckily, it did not take long for me to get into crypto once I've read about it the first time.
Unfortunately, I didn't have much money back then (now neither). But with the current coins I'm hodling I hope I'll get into a better financial situation soon. (:
