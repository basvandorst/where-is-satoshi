That is a Very "deep and thoughtful" counter argument.

Don't feel too bad... imagine how this guy felt.
"Man accidentally threw away $127 million in bitcoin..." now THAT, is a CONTRIBUTION!

Personally I think we are still 5 years away for $1mil per Bitcoin... but I might have to sacrifice my neighbors cat to appease the Bitcoin Gods to make sure we hit $1mil by 2020. Because if we don't, then John Mcafee promised he will perform fellatio on himself... sorry Fluffy, this is for the good of mankind.

I bet most Americans do not know the Federal Reserve is a **private banking cartel** (Its as "Federal" as Fedex) and your personal income tax was implemented around the same time in 1913... Must be a coincidence right?
This book should be mandatory reading in high school. Take the red pill...  [

The Federal Reserve is as Federal as Fedex. It is a private banking cartel. Take the red pill...  and learn the truth

Your personal income tax was instituted shortly after... do the math.

Do these incompetent / corrupt governments ever take the time to think that this kind of immoral behavior will stop entrepreneurs, investors (and their money), skilled immigrants coming to their countries? Money / smart people will go where they are treated best. It's not rocket science.

Do you hear that rumble???  Its the stampede of money managers and institutional investors deciding to put 1% or more allocation to Bitcoin. The risk of NOT having some skin in this crypto game is HUGE! And they know it. That will be PHASE 1 of the next bull. Phase 2 is when general public wants in (still years away from it being easy enough for the average Joe or your Grandma)
