BTW he's founder of an insurance company for cryptocurrencies:
"Inscrypto offers insurance products for crypto-currencies. We're like the FDIC for Bitcoin.
Our goal is to help people and companies minimize or completely eliminate the risks of holding crypto-currencies, such as loss, theft and fraud, in order to spark mainstream consumer interest in Bitcoin. We work with professional investors who guarantee consumer deposits in exchange for the ability to essentially trade crypto-currencies on margin without directly owning non-USD funds."

Apparently that's his pseudonym.

The answer to 3) is likely he edited the PDF, putting black boxes over some financial data. Therefore his name appears in the annotation's metadata. The original author may be different, but metadata about the author was possibly removed.

At least the desk and the keyboard [on the cat pic]( looks the same as the one [Karpeles uses](
On the cat pic there is also an ID card for the Cerulean Tower, where Mt.Gox resides. So this at least confirms that the pic was taken at Karpeles' desk. So either him or someone with close access, or someone who has pics of Karpeles' cat.

Not necessarily. It could mean he just edited it (removed stuff from it). The author could be different.

seems like it's true...

He is Ryan Selkis:
1) The raw source of the PDF document leaked by twobitidiot has his name in it: 
2) He said this on his [Twitter](  "Been having a lot of fun being a  these past couple of months. Follow me there if you want to read my bits on 
EDIT: 1) means he edited the PDF censoring some numbers, but the original author may be different.
EDIT2: He explains the Mt.Gox leak and his motives [in this article](
EDIT3: He publishes articles under the name [Ryan Galt]( on Coindesk.
