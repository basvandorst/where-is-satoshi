Look at this trend  .. you can see money is fleeing BTC for altcoins. The trend is there.. it's in the data and data doesn't lie.

The CNN article cites some sources that appear to show an increase in BTC purchases from Greece. I doubt these figures are responsible for the current price surge.. I mean there were probably not many Greek citizens buying BTC in the first place (need source), so a 79% increase probably doesn't represent much vis a vis the rest of global demand.
"Bitcoin trades from Greece have shot up 79% from their ten-week average on Bitstamp [...]"
"LakeBTC, headquartered in Shanghai, is seeing a 40% increase in visitors using computers in Greece."

Most Argentines don't speak English well so the reason is pretty obvious why they wouldn't know of, or use, Reddit. Also, Argentines have a strong DIY ethic and have an almost universal distaste for (what they call "capitalistic") US products/services. They have their own physical space to discuss bitcoin in person, Espacio Bitcoin

It wasn’t down. There were a lot of unconfirmed transactions just like what has happened to bitcoin a bunch of times already. Also, remember the recent $40 fees on bitcoin?

There aren't many people who have this level of ground-floor visibility into the bitcoin industry. This is a good sign - a sign he sees big potential in bitcoin.

I'm a software VP with a pretty decent sized company in the financial sector and I have been using bitwage for around three or four months. The premium they charge is low. My pay day is Friday and by Saturday afternoon, my bitwage coins are in my wallet. Service has been flawless. So yeah I am saying they exceeded my expectations and I'm a happy customer.

You want an exchange that has the highest volume trade transactions and lowest bid/ask spreads. Coinbase Exchange seems to be a good bet. You should put in limit orders to get the best price as the price goes through its normal daily high/lows. Note that Coinbase wallet is totally different than the exchange trading platform.

Not correct.
Every trade will require a transaction fee paid to miner. This will bring bitcoin one step closer to Satoshi's longterm vision where tx fees will become the primary source of income for miners.

Bitwage is going after the employer market in addition to already serving individuals. Check out their site. I've been using them for at least a year to get part of my paycheck given to me in BTC. Works great. BTC gets sent to my address same day as payday.

Thanks for posting this. I also buy large amounts at circle which is ACH'd to my BoA account. Previously, Conestoga Bank closed my account after my first wire to Bitstamp. I have always hated banks even before bitcoin was created.
I just requested an account with BitWage - I hope they approve my account. I cannot wait for the day that banks die. They are criminals.

The circle price is usually just a few dollars above the coindesk.com price index.

In addition, the +3 clock doesn't increment on Friday, Saturday, or Sunday. So, if you trade on Friday, you're waiting much longer than T+3 to get your money. Happens to me all the time and it is super annoying.

CCN is trash. I'm not trashing you just to sling shit but you guys really need to stop running articles based on rumors and unconfirmed sources. There is also strong bias in many of your articles. 
Recent example:  It is irresponsible journalism to state in the title that Uber is accepting btc when you didn't confirm the source and verify that it is an official announcement by the company. Yes, you state that it is unconfirmed in the body of the article, but still the title is misleading and basically trash clickbait.
Please, for the sake of bitcoin, clean up your act.

Airbitz is the best IMO because of the awesome directory listing and every other feature is on par or better than other wallets. Copay was just released by Bitpay. I'm testing it out today.. looks promising.

It's called "cost averaging". Don't buy them all at once. The idea is that you make purchases over a time period (of your choosing) while the asset fluctuates up and down over this period. Unless the investor has nonpublic insight to the market, he will be generally better off with this approach. *this is not investment advice, just regurgitation of what I learned in college.

My boss literally came to me yesterday and said the same thing. He had been a huge skeptic for the last year that I was telling him about it. Now he wants me to teach him about how to buy and protect it. He said he's going to put $1,000 into BTC from every paycheck now. I guess this is an evangelism success story :)

Thanks man, I didn't realize bitpay came out with an iOS wallet!! send a coffee!
Can you help me understand how this one works? I come from bitWallet, where I can see all my addresses, address balances, and their private keys. 
1. Copay doesn't show the addresses/pks and I'm assuming it generates a new address to hold my funds every time there is a transaction? 
2. Are all funds in a Copay wallet always held in just one address?
3. How would I load my addresses on another wallet made by a different organization? I don't see anything in the app or website talking about a BIP32 wallet seed.

Yes, almost all of Argentines have Italian and Spanish ancestry. Their Spanish dialect resembles the Italian Neapolitan dialect. They use many Italian words, which is referred to as Lunfardo. Their cuisine is overwhelmingly Italian.

I used a small local bank in Philadelphia in early 2015 to successfully wire funds to Bitstamp. The bank immediately closed my account and later said their compliance department made an error in letting it go through. As far as I'm aware, I haven't experienced any impact from that with my dealings with other banks. I regularly use Bank of America to ach funds to exchanges with no issues.

Have you seen increased business due to backpage customers? How much, roughly? I personally believe this behavior by banks and processors (same how they treat pot businesses) will be their undoing and contribute to bitcoin's first real widespread use cases. Truly, the web's first use case was porn and those of us who were adults or coming of age in the mid to late nineties know this to be true :)

The grexit is still a possibility. The majority of Greek people are against additional austerity measures and the Greek parliament still has to approve these measures.
Also, the bridge loans won't be released to Greece until the measures are passed by the Greek parliament.
This is more of kicking the can down the road. The simple fact is that Greece has a debt-to-GDP ratio of nearly 180%. Their GDP has fallen 25% since 2008. The Greek people will continue to be the poor of the EU for many years ahead.

I don't believe these numbers, but it's just a hunch. They say, "About one in four currently save up to 20% of their money in Bitcoin". Really?! I'd be curious to know the total dollar amount of 20% of all savings of the citizens in those countries surveyed.

Is 80% still an accurate number? I've been watching fiatleak and the USD is actually ahead of CNY by a wide margin. Of course it's 11:38 New York time and 23:58 in Shanghai. Maybe fiatleak isn't the best judge but when the original stat of 80% came out, fiatleak was indicating about that exact percentage.

When I registered, the site told me it is not yet available in my state. It kept my account active, but I could do nothing on the site. However, after I just read your comment, I logged into my account and what do you know, I can buy coins now. Thanks ;)

Why wouldn't I? Because I don't want to have to wait ~10 minutes for a single confirmation. Everyone who has used BTC for an everyday purchase knows that this is a big drawback to using it for buying coffee for ex.
However, if I were buying a new TV and the merchant was offering 5% off with BTC purchases, then I would be willing to wait. But not for coffee, groceries, etc.
Point is, in its current incarnation, BTC is not a convenient payment method, but it is an excellent store of value. 
IMO, BTC will never be widely used as a payment method. Its use case will remain "digital gold", while another coin with faster confirmation times (and perhaps built-in inflation) is used as currency for everyday purchases.
