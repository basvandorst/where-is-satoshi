I have not gone in except for a tiny bit just got the sake it because to me the price volatility is a big problem. I don't want to invest in btc I want to have it as a storehouse a safe place to have some assets and spend them very liquid.
But right now I'd have to have lots of faith in it which I don't, to deal with the volatility.

In order for that to be prevented it would require ruining the way btc operates.
I used to hate the Fed and fiat, since btc became popular I have a new found appreciation for fiat

Gold is not decentralized it is a physical object, big difference in psyche. I would say those btc physical coins people have also would be treated differently than btc in the virtual

People hate it because the act of mining is utterly worthless and a waste of resources. They hate it because regardless of what proponents say it is deflationary and not effective long term as a currency. They hate it because the concentration of large holders is unappealing.
Then others hate it because right now anyway it is unstable.

Btc is decentralized it exists in no country but all countries. I think crimes against btc are out of all jurisdictions

They are right about the concentration of wealth. Before anyone says anything about dollar concentration, btc is supposed to be better than fiat

I disagree about this. Take gox for example, let's say things remain as they are today.
Seven percent of current coins are either lost out of circulation or in possession of a criminal.
That does not give clear idea.

What you think is a strength or cool,  is why i think btc will never mainstream. 
@_date: 2015-10-29 15:46:36
Says tech behind, and block chain. Anyone with knowledge can see how block chain is revolutionary. Btc on other hand was just first iteration, and most first iterations aren't around meaningfully long term. 
Better off investing in other block chain tech then just buying bitcoins.
@_date: 2015-02-02 15:04:22
Now bitcoin hundred thousandaires. Though i think most are still millionaires just need 5k btc.

Wrong, first country to widely implement bitcoin will fail miserably. However first country to create is own crypto using mammy of the features of bitcoin can become a trendsetter and have its currency become the new dollar
@_date: 2015-03-09 14:48:26
Crypto will be the future but bitcoin will never be, it is the first generation a crypto that solves it's problems will be preferred. Also btc had too many early adopters claim to big a slice and no one of real merit will accept that.

Oh you mean the India who banned import of gold or holding of gold? Yeaaa I'm sure the government won't do anything.

Bit coin is trash until its price stabilizes. Whether at five hundred or ten thousand etc, it needs to cut its volatility. As a business owner I see value in the idea of btc but what happens when someone comes in and buys an item with btc when it's trading at $800 and then hour later price drops to $650? Sure could rise again but I'm more concerned at mitigating risk which btc does not do right now.
@_date: 2013-11-27 12:31:06
Wrong if you don't know whether those coins will be cashed out or spent at some future time they are part of the ecosystem and there is no gain in the other coins value. You must know with certainty they are no longer part of total btc for other coins to have more value.
Otherwise who's to say when a coin is being forever hoarded or just saved for future use? 
@_date: 2013-11-04 05:33:58
I implemented btc on our site (selling microscopes) we have only done one sale in btc over the past seventy days, but it cost nothing to implement. 
Edit- for reference we have sold about (returns) 280 microscopes people paying in USD during same time frame.

Only because it was first, and had network effect. Need to provide something truly better to supplant, not just be me to, or gimmicky better.
Personally I like prime coin and namecoin more, though nc is not made for money .
@_date: 2013-12-04 13:48:51
Right and that means it won't find serious acceptance for transactions

Not true unless it is hundred percent known what address is lost and that it is forever gone. 
@_date: 2013-12-05 20:47:29
You're right and wrong. Btc has hard limit on number of coins, losses and out of circulation will affect its long term value negatively because it limits how many people can be involved.
Before you say btc will just be worth ten thousand a coin think if that's really reasonable would anyone new come in if it has such a high price per coin and concentration of wealth.? Coin dividing eight zeroes is not attractive to the masses in my opinion(time will tell).
Point is crypto is future and btc is showing us what the ideal crypto should and shouldn't do.
@_date: 2013-12-03 02:55:52
because you still have the same number of coins, just cutting them down more. But as for disuading people from holding  onto thier whole coins this does nothing. There will still be only 21mm whole coins even if divisible to fifty 0s. I own 100 whole coins them being divisible incentives me to spend them how? If I think they are going to appreciate in vale?
Still deflationary.

The fact no one knows who he/they are maybe bc was created by nsa as mentioned, this is a main reason I have limited my involvement. 
I am still not convinced there is no back door or master code that can in effect compromise the whole bit coin world.
@_date: 2013-11-26 23:52:58
I don't trust only because nsa developed so have to believe they have secret backdoor or something.

Price is based on demand solely, be it speculation or functional use or whatever.
@_date: 2013-12-03 01:15:57
Everyone has their own interests at heart. Peter with gold and most of you with btc. 
Many here have convinced themselves and surround themselves (bitcoin sub) repeating the same things about the greatness of btc.
BTC is a flawed crypto, i agree it is not a ponzi or scam but it does have many flaws. Divisibility is not a solution for deflation.
Gold is honestly garbage as a store of wealth it has very limited worthwhile industrial usage. Silver or copper or silicon or platnium or titanium are all better stores of value compared to gold becausee they have great functional use in our modern and future world, which can not be duplicated (not  making element out of nothing or another cheaper element).
BTC though benefiting from netowrk effect really is not unique in anyway. It is just a matter of laziness and ingrained interests by current users who bad mouth alternatives. Cryptocurrency will be the way of the future I hope but I do not think it will be btc. None of the current alts from what I have seen are deserving of the title either. The sole exception being  name coin but not for currency instead as distributed dns system it is awesome.

Short term yes but long term you need to utilize its functional value
@_date: 2013-11-27 05:25:00
That means nothing. Still whole coins would be lost, meaning whole tradeable coins gone.

For all of bitcoin greatness. I once wired $50k to the wrong account and was able to get it back.
Bitcoin on other hand you're not getting much back. Irreversible transactions double edged sword.
