Dude, you and me both, they have over $1000USD of mine, and they have had it for three days. For whatever reason, by the Bitinstant Tracking system, at least one of my money transfers appears  AS " Coinapult  Order Loading" and "Mt. Gox Order Loading". 
 I studied their web site and terms of service very thoroughly.
 They have clauses for "Reasonable Delays", however they don't define what reasonable may be.  I am writing a letter to them, I will share when I am finished.
 On another hand, This makes me wonder if they were hacked again, or just don't have the coin, or the resources to advance the coin, and are at the mercy of Mt.Gox to provide the coin.
 That they refuse, or ignore communication is very frustrating, if there is an issue, something should be said on their website, and customers with orders should at least be emailed. 
 I have been begging ZipZap for the Merchant ID Order Number, so far they have provided me only with one (79eab6ad-4e9a-4a97-8955-aef4fcafe829)  the other 2 orders I have pending are as follows The second is:
Amount to Pay: $503.95
Receive Code: 9611
Account Number: 543931851
and the third is :
Amount to Pay: $128.95
Receive Code: 9611
Account Number: 649149804
Don't be surprised if I should show up on your door step Bitinstant
 I finally got the Merchant Order ID Number from ZipZap 
Your request ( has been updated.
