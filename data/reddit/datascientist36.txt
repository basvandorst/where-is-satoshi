What exchanges/platforms are available for US traders that allow that ability to short sell BTC?
@_date: 2019-10-19 19:16:46
Really, the only issue is the huge price fluctuations. A business can't really adopt BTC as mainstream when the price of 1BTC can drop $1000 in a minute. Compared to currencies where $1 will always be $1. Even when its comes to foreign currencies, the the eur vs. Dollar might move 1 cent in a whole month.

The only thing that scares me about BTC is the price is determined by the market and it's very very volatile.  
  
I trade FX and USD might fluctuate a couple cents in a day. BTC fluctuates thousands of dollars in a day and I don't ever see it staying stable. Most of the trades are just trading algos too which means flash crashes can happen.  
  
Also, I personally think the banks have already bought a large amount of BTC to manipulate prices if they need too. I think they are the ones that made it rise in 2017.
@_date: 2019-09-30 11:41:53
No. IMO It will always be determined by the exchange supply and demand which essentially means it will never be stable because there is no party there to keep it at a steady rate. The banks most likely want it this way so it will never become a real currency like the USD, EUR, etc.

BTC is already pegged to all of these currencies. I already tested this to see if you can buy BTC with USD, sell the BTC in another currency, then buy a different coin and convert back to USD. The market is already mostly efficient on this. You'll end up losing money due to fees.

"'neo-American' oligarchy" is political buzzwords with no real meaning.

They don't have to. they can either -  
    
* have governments ban/restrict crpyto  
* use the money they print to purchase large amounts of crpyto to control markets (which is happening now IMO)  
  


  
They can do this with any company that is using crpyto for payments.....

@_date: 2019-09-19 14:28:23
IMO this is why I think the central banks allow crpyto to exist because at the end of the day it's essentially pegged to USD like everything else in the world.....
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:22:29
Agreed but a company won't allow BTC payments if it can't use the BTC it gets to buy more products, pay taxes, etc. which is the current issue that I see with BTC.
@_date: 2019-09-19 15:55:13


  
Is it a currency if you can't buy anything with it?  
  


  
It wouldn't be the government doing this. The government could implement restrictions. The Fed could easily give a member bank x amount of money to buy x amount of BTC. That's how it works with USD.
@_date: 2019-09-19 17:56:48
IMO that doesn't really happen due to the huge price fluctuations. You could buy at $10000 but when you go to convert back to local currency it could be $9000 and you basically lose that $1000 for each BTC you have.
@_date: 2019-09-23 12:08:15

----------------  
  
When you look at actual metrics, you're paying more in almost all categories and paying more in taxes. I personally don't want to pay double the amount in taxes and pay more for almost all consumer goods........ Their healthcare isn't better than ours which is what most people believe. Their healthcare will not ever really get better because it's all government controlled now and theres no $$ for r&amp;d and the [US is the leader in R&amp;D]( [The US produces the most GDP.](  
  
Don't fall for the media hype man..... Those countries are better than the US based on real statistics. Trying to turn the US into one of these countries makes everything 2x more expensive, we have a way large population so all the free stuff your pushing for will add trillions in debt and hyperinflation.   
  
Theres a reason why most people in the world are trying to come to the US and not these countries......... They can't match the opportunity and options we have here. You need to learn to love your country man. You have it better than most and you take it for granted.

Keep in mind, I'm not saying I'm against BTC and I definitely want it to succeed. However, since it's been pegged to the USD, it can easily be controlled now like oil, gold, silver, etc. The central banks can make governments ban crypto if they ever needed to. Also, all the prices have huge volatility because the price is purely based on the trading markets now which makes it kinda unstable. At any time it can rise to $20K or drop to $0 and since there is no regulation around these markets they can be manipulated with no consequences.

The healthcare systems you're pushing for are completely owned by the government? It's not just "some" gov control. Our politicians can barely handle what they're currently doing and you want to give them control over the entire healthcare system? I sure don't.   
  
Also, all of the R&amp;D in healthcare is mainly coming from the US.  We lose all that R&amp;D money by implementing what you're suggesting so all the new medicines and treatments are stagnated and we lose all that progress.  
  
  
  
The US spends 4x the amount of R&amp;D than Japan and almost 2x the amount of all of Europe.......... You don't want better treatments?  
  
Are you aware of how Medicaid works? You know Meidcaid covers all the low-income people right? My ex had her appendix taken out and had no insurance. She got a bill for $40K. Guess how much she paid? $0 due to Medicaid.   
  


  
You see, the difference between me and you is I base my opinion on the facts and data. You are going on pure speculation. You haven't provided any stats or data to support any of your claims and all youre doing is repeating what you see in the news headlines........ UHC pushes healthcare in the US backwards, not forwards. There is literally no way for it to get better under UHC. Again, which is why [US has 5/10 of the top hospitals in the world.....](

Most expensive doesn't matter when you have insurance buddy. I live by a Cleveland clinic and my ex had to get her appendix taken out and had no insurance. Got a bill for $40K and didn't have to pay a dime thanks to medicaid. These hospitals also have their own financial department's that help low income people too.
