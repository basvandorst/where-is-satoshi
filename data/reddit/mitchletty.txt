@_date: 2018-01-16 19:29:09
Gold is great! havent researched it enough to confidently invest but it always has and always will hold value 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:00:29
They're smart enough to see they got very lucky and need to get something before its too late 
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:20:01
Sorry hard to tell on here sometimes hahah
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:51:02

@_date: 2018-01-16 20:57:49
Nothing more powerful than a bunch of HODLers on my back.. ��
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:09:59
Dont be salty because your monopoly money currency is finally falling back to where it belongs.. ;) 
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:15:07
Should have sold when it was at 20k "my friend", this is the end and you know it.. Sell now and thank me later when you can afford nice things with the bitcoin money you have made
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:49:58
HODLers are the scum of the earth and deserve all the lows that are coming their way IMO 
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:59:18
T-HODLers lmfao I love it
@_date: 2018-01-16 21:21:02
a-holes are the only ones who buy this garbage... next question
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:10:14
I really hope they didn't invest more than they can afford to lose, but its what happens when you invest based solely on hype and hype alone  
@_date: 2018-01-16 19:52:00
Bitcoin was inflated and volatile due to public perception and misunderstanding of what is actually being backed by banks and large development companies. The important thing to understand from the recent popularity of crypto-currency is the backing decentralized architectural algorithm: block chaining, NOT BITCOIN
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:12:23
Shouldn't have invested in the first place lol
@_date: 2018-01-16 20:03:27
You invested in Bitcoin?  
@_date: 2018-01-16 18:11:25
because im tired of seeing regular people invest way too much into this nothing currency only to see everything gone, its time for this to finally end and maybe people can invest in things with actual value, only my two cents 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:18:30
Let's review the major Bitcoin news today:
1) Steam no longer accepting Bitcoin due to volatility and high fees
2) The blockchain has a backlog of 100k transactions; can't handle current transaction rates
3) Another exit scam has stolen 60 million from retail investors
Result? BTC up $2000+ USD.
If you don't think this is a bubble you are completely disillusional.
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:51:46
The beginning of the end for bitcoin :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:18:12
You don't have time to argue because you have no response due to the fact that I'm right... 
Thanks for confirming this, and I wish you the best of luck on your Bitcoin while the value still lasts 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:55:48
I really hope you didnt buy a lot because youre about to lose a lot of money my friend, leave on top
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:43:35
I think you're probably high 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:00:19


ONCE again, you fail to point out why my points are invalid.. I truly believe you are the one not quite all there.. 
Thanks and have a nice day 
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:22:25
THIS is the reason bitcoin will never survive.. people like this.. smfh 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:14:17
Im going to love when this bubble bursts and its going to become an irrelivent currency once again (not that it already isn't completely irrelivent and 100% controlled by greed and get rich quick scheme artists) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 13:50:38
false.. over 50% of canadas energy comes from nuclear, enjoy the bitcoin crash  
@_date: 2017-12-07 18:06:10
A realist who knows bitcoin is based entirely off speculation and will eventually fail? I'm getting out before its too late 
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:22:00
Im all for making money, just annoys me when people claim this is the future and act as if its actually useful for purchasing things.. never going to happen 
@_date: 2017-12-05 16:03:48
hope it gets completely dissolved, its terrible for the environment and will use way too much energy 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:36:07
Alright well enjoy your Bitcoin while it still lasts my friend, just remember "I WAS RIGHT" :) 
@_date: 2017-12-07 19:26:58
If your only argument against my points is that I made a spelling error, then I think we know who is right here.. :) 
Have a nice day 
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:11:54
If you could actually comprehend the valid points I made (which you obviously can't), then you would see that I actually do contribute. Just because you know I'm right and don't agree with and it makes you angry just makes it that much more satisfying :)  
@_date: 2017-12-07 16:26:12
bubble about to burst :)
@_date: 2017-12-07 20:16:24
Thank you for confirming I'm right, enjoy your Bitcoin while it still lasts 
@_date: 2017-12-07 17:09:33
