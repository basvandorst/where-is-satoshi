When i say Bitcoin at Albanian Banks they have no idea what it is.  They are like "Arre you crazy  what is this".  So the problem is only with Businesses that use Bitcoin or also with people that invest and withdraw tonfiat Btc?

Instead of going out and calling a company a scam so easily why you don't try to communicate a little bit more and WAIT
Seriously they are old im using em 2 years now made 200+ orders and got my money every single time. 
You better wait before you go out and call something a scam
