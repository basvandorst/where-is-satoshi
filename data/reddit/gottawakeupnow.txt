given the marketing terminology used "innovators, early adopters, laggards"etc., i would say 5% of m, which is total potential adopters, in a bass model, which is a model that predicts adoption over time based on parameters p and q, rates of the total potential adopters that are innovators and imitators, respectively. problem is when m fluctuates. and when you have to account for repurchasing and people leaving the product and coming back, etc, which are not factored into the original bass model, and require a more generalized model. also worth noting this is typically applied to products, like iphone, tv's, cell phones, satellites, etc. bitcoin is a bit ambiguous. is it a store of value? is it a currency? is it a transaction facilitating product?

well again i don't know how whoever made that chart constructed their model, but in a simple bass model, m is the total potential adopters that *will* 100% without a doubt adopt at some point. there are generalized bass models that account for growth in the group of people that will at some point in the future necessarily adopt, as well. since you can't say for certain 7.6 million people will for sure adopt, and even to say a few million will *for sure* adopt at some point requires a boatload of assumptions, i would be curious to see what went into our friend's chart.

the utility is positively correlated with the number of adopters. its a momentary problem of solving for the fee issues that once solved will lower thresholds of adopters needed to jump to higher levels of utility, because many adopters will not adopt until a certain utility has been met.

the real shame is is just reposting that chart from somewhere else, without background info, and probably doesn't understand what went on behind the curtains himself. Its just a cutesy chart that makes people feel special because they're *first adopters*...do your homework people...
