Another one. 
@_date: 2015-06-24 06:45:45
Why would you want that garbage anyway?
@_date: 2015-06-12 19:32:34
Totally disagree. Some current shitty wallets? Maybe. Systemically? Bitcoin is orders of magnitude better. 
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:38:29
"digital currencies are far more susceptible to hacking attacks."
They think they can just get away with saying that?
@_date: 2015-06-12 05:33:42
I told this guy I wanted to give him Bitcoin over a year ago, no response.
@_date: 2015-06-30 20:44:03
Strange, chrome is misreporting this. On the current beta channel (mac).
@_date: 2014-07-28 20:54:04
right, maybe if you have 3 addresses that would work, most of us have many, and having to dive down into each one is straight up retarded.
@_date: 2014-03-11 16:25:21
If you look at the bottom you'll see "0 nodes connected" they are definitely having issues.

This site has now disappeared.
@_date: 2014-03-25 00:06:12
Because, the state?
@_date: 2014-11-11 00:57:48
Back up.
@_date: 2014-01-20 23:22:42
I can't believe people who are so security minded think putting your private key in your wallet printed on paper is a good idea. Blockchain.info with 2FA and a second sending password is both more secure and more convenient.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:21:56
Awesome, can you comment on the Turbine Cyclone Perculator Water Pipe? How does it hit compared to other peculator bongs you've hit? Have one in my cart...
@_date: 2014-07-21 17:24:52
There's seriously no transaction history in the app? How the hell is that overlooked?
@_date: 2014-01-23 05:55:20
Because if you get drunk and leave your wallet at the bar you're fucked, a printed private key that you carry around is just dumb.
@_date: 2014-05-30 13:11:07
If you had 2FA I your google account this would have been prevented, no?
@_date: 2015-05-13 02:57:24
The "quick review" section is one of the most concise explanations of the blockchain I've ever seen.
@_date: 2014-03-04 22:26:09
Actually, I just tried to check out and got an error when it redirected me to BitPay. It looks like the id wasn't in the url which probably caused the error.

Gyft is easier and more reassuring to use than these weird 3rd party payment plugins...
@_date: 2015-01-24 19:20:04
Over the phone maybe. Not in a public space.
@_date: 2015-01-19 04:49:05
No, but there are a few that take potcoin...
@_date: 2015-01-31 19:26:12
You're just wrong about this, hundreds of court decisions all the way up to the supreme confirm people's right to record in public, especially the police.
@_date: 2015-07-15 19:14:06
Get her a Trezor and stop whining.

Donate to someone who wants to exproprate my property? No thanks. 
@_date: 2015-04-26 08:49:48
This is old by now, but it seems like coinsimple.com is doing this.
@_date: 2015-09-23 07:31:08
Patents are aggression.
@_date: 2015-09-07 02:23:41
AVG = Malware
@_date: 2015-09-23 16:52:04
First of all, Tesla is not libertarian so they're probably not going to be against patent root and branch. Also, registering patents is fine, using them defensively is fine, using them aggressively is not.

I run 2 full nodes. Join me.
@_date: 2015-02-24 05:42:09
Ripple is a completely different product with a completely different feature set.
@_date: 2015-03-20 17:01:14
Thank you :)

Who buys soap at whole foods? Whole foods is good for, well, whole foods. Especially grass fed meats.
@_date: 2013-11-18 22:51:48
I want to do this 1000 times over. Which payment processor are you using?
@_date: 2013-11-19 22:34:48
I'd like you to know that Bitcoin has the potential to end your career as a professional criminal.
@_date: 2013-12-10 04:37:37
Email sent.
@_date: 2013-12-09 22:13:45
Can you make one on a bottle opener keychain? I'd buy that.
@_date: 2013-11-04 19:36:56
Over 90 mins here and no confirmations as well... 1% network propagation.
@_date: 2013-12-19 05:16:21
Cool, but Ace is super overpriced. They charge almost double for every item you can think of when compared to HD or Lowes.
@_date: 2013-11-03 20:26:17
I've tried most of these sweets. Amazeballs.
@_date: 2013-11-14 19:26:52
$86 credit! This is awesome.
@_date: 2013-11-14 05:44:27
As a backup, I nominate Jeffrey Tucker.
@_date: 2013-12-03 18:34:42
You'll use it up eventually... It would be awesome if you could just choose your own amount though.
