Before anything, excuse my english.
- Im not a genesis user, admin or something like that.
- I think your calcs are wrong in part.
- You recover the invest in the begining of the second year.
Now, lets clarify this situation using yours numbers.
Lets round the BTC to $1000 to faster an clear calcs.
Genesis ask 0.000150313 BTC/GH "upfront fee"- thats the price of the GH in genesis and is about $0.15. These GHs you buyed are yours "forever" until contract termination. (Read the contract again)
Also they ask 0.00028 BTC/GH daily for electricity and maintenance purposes - thats the daily fee (about $0.28)
So 700 GH will cost you:
Buy Fee: 700GH*0.000150313 BTC = 0.1052191 BTC
Daily Fee: 700GH*0.000000280824 BTC = 0.0001965768 BTC daily
Anual fee = Daily Fee*365 = 0.071750532 BTC
700GH/s will generate ≈ 0.1554 BTC a year
In the first year you have:
0.1554 BTC - 0.1052191 BTC - 0.071750532 = -0.021569632 (about -$21.6). This is only the part of your invest not recovered yet
Lets see it in another way:
In a year they pay you:
0.1554 BTC (mined) - 0.071750532 BTC (maintenance fee) = 0.083649468 BTC
Obviously 0.083649468 BTC - 0.1052191 (invested) = -0.021569632 BTC (the same -$21.6 already). This is the rest of your invest not recovered yet.
In the second year you dont have to repay the upfront, only the maintenance fee is deducted from mined:
Again 0.1554 BTC (mined) - 0.071750532 BTC (maintenance fee) = 0.083649468 BTC
0.083649468 BTC - 0.021569632 BTC (remained of invest not recovered) = 0.062079836 BTC
In conclusion you recover your invest in the second year and withdraw 0.062079836 BTC (about $62). Later years you will withdraw 0.083649468 BTC/ a year (about $83). Like i said until contract termination by time expiration (not comon in BTC contracts) or not profitable (maintenance fee &gt; mined).
