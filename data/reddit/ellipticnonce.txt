The gamble is to block all other scaling solutions.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:37:16
There are always intermediate solutions. Nobody in their right mind would claim that &lt;20 MB blocks would put Bitcoin in danger to be destroyed by centralization.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:40:07
LN does not block other scaling solutions. The developers that support LN do.
@_date: 2018-01-01 15:22:47
What I don't like with LN is that it is a gamble with a 200 Billion USD network with a technology that is not clear to be adopted by users.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:52:29
If you dial in a custom fee, gamble for reduced transaction numbers, keep checking whether it goes through, and eventually use RBF.
But that is neither a solution nor sth the average user wants.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:11:20
I know well enough how LN works.
But I also know that most people in the world send money with their phone by simply scanning a QR code. The threshold to open and fund a Lightning channel is too high for most people.

Oh my... hard to believe how efficient the propaganda has been working.

I am around longer than you. Get off my lawn.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:45:52
You mean you want to regulate cryptocurrencies and make insider trading illegal? Good luck with this.
Lots of hypocrites here, being against government influence and wanting decentralized exchanges. But at the same time wanting regulations against insider trading? wtf
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:12:09


Quite a gamble to assume that bitcoin still plays a role by the time all the problems with LN are solved.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:46:41
You guys need to chill. I wouldn't consider to talk about a crash before bitcoin falls below 3000 USD.
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:44:34
Well, if there are only a few merchants it will be difficult. 
If we are going further backwards in merchant adoption I guess I have to sell all my bitcoins for Alpaca socks.
@_date: 2017-12-19 01:03:25
But in this case only to other rich people. 
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:21:02
Segwit will just increase the transaction capacity by a factor of 1.7. This will not change much.
@_date: 2017-12-30 09:09:29
I assume some exchanges might accept some form of extended verification eg via passport.
Would be nice to know whether someone had this problem.
@_date: 2017-12-31 10:02:20
Most Bitcoin Core developers have been actively (and unreasonable in my opinion) fighting against an immediate scaling solution through a blocksize increase. 
They are hoping for a scaling solution called Lightning Network that might be ready for normal users in around 1 year time and might or might not find user adoption.

Someone who invests 10000 USD is "taxed" 0.1% by a 10 USD fee.
Someone who invests 100 USD would be "taxed" 10%.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:37:13
People here rather want to see bitcoin dying than admitting that we need a temporary scaling solution.
@_date: 2017-12-14 19:03:36
Decentralization through large number of nodes is not required in Bitcoin. The number of nodes is highly adjustable and can react to network attacks.
In case someone wants to take over bitcoin, we can spin up a large number of nodes very easily. It just requires a single honest person to have a remaining copy of the blockchain and distribute it in case of an attack.
It doesn't require millions of people to run full nodes on raspberry pis.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:17:24
Oh yes, the good old times of bullshit propaganda. Blocks will never be more than 1.7 MB with segwit and normal use.
@_date: 2017-12-26 07:58:10
Miners do not set fees.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:26:25
Ok, no problem then. u/gvjordan found the solution to scaling. Just pay less. Everything will be good.
Now repeat after me: It is all just spam attacks.
@_date: 2017-12-20 10:05:58
Everybody here is talking about insider trading. What is this insider news you are talking about? Is it still unknown?
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:43:33
Here is the behavior of the demand curve before blocks were full:
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:49:52


Obviously enough of an inconvenience for merchants to go backwards on bitcoin adoption.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:26:46


Sure, and magically the price rises through increased adoption at the same time.
It is always fascinating to see the delusion and lies about "spam attacks".
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:59:56
Maybe you should stick with traditional financial markets then.
Too many people that want to get rid of the decentralized and trustless nature of bitcoin here.
@_date: 2017-12-26 06:29:46
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:03:11
No, it has not. Even the core client does not support it in its GUI.
@_date: 2017-12-27 15:01:17
And bitcoin is the one with backwards merchant adoption. It is very concerning seeing more and more businesses stopping to accept bitcoin.
@_date: 2017-12-20 14:54:43
Cool, we should start selling the narrative that miners don't want a blocksize increase in order to collect more fees. 
There might be enough people here that are susceptible to this narrative.
@_date: 2017-12-21 05:27:32
No need for segwit to fix that. And if BCH wants they can copy that code, too.
Welcome to open source.
@_date: 2017-12-30 07:20:02
The logical consumer choice is to not spend bitcoin if it costs 50 USD in fees and it might take several days to confirm.
And the merchants do not want to deal with this drama.
@_date: 2017-12-14 21:34:27
Tulips are verifiable, the ones with special patterns are limited, it takes many years to develop new genetic traits (mining).
I am not saying that bitcoin is closely related to tulips. But before just dismissing tulip-mania, it is actually quite interesting to read about it. It was not just stupid people collecting random stones.
@_date: 2017-12-20 20:25:34


If that's all you need I can offer you plenty strings of data that you can move to /dev/null
@_date: 2017-12-27 14:23:33
Right now not reality. And might never find adoption because of many complications. 
Now go and buy yourself a coffee with LN.
@_date: 2017-12-24 07:07:44
They are getting less strict when there is no immediate danger of a competitor taking over.
@_date: 2017-12-25 09:23:49
The hypocrites are still busy implementing segwit in the bitcoin core GUI while simultaneously complaining that businesses don't implement it fast enough.
@_date: 2017-12-08 13:32:43
I am sceptical that LN will provide user friendly solutions that will be accepted.
@_date: 2017-12-25 10:57:18
It is the evil users and companies not being smart and not wanting what the developers want.
@_date: 2017-12-30 08:32:29
The difference is that the CC settlement goes through most of the time and doesn't require extensive research of fees for every transaction.
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:04:50


And usually they don't happen the way people expect them to happen. Which includes LN as well as flying cars.

Bitcoin is whatever the 51% majority of users and stakeholders want it to be.

@_date: 2017-12-21 04:51:56


You mispelled open source.
@_date: 2017-12-20 00:58:18
The problem is that not even the core client supports segwit by default. 
This has been foreseeable and the stubborn resistance against any immediate scaling solution puts the &gt;500 Billion USD bitcoin network at risk.
@_date: 2017-12-20 01:00:26
It would be nice if all you poor people could leave my bitcoin. 13$ transactions?! What would you even buy for that? /s
@_date: 2017-12-30 13:11:55
So you deny that merchant adoption is getting less and less?
And please name some of the leftover exchanges that are not regulated and government controlled.
I dont think I am overly dramatic with these statements.
@_date: 2017-12-24 10:18:46
Just wait until adoption reduces a bit more. Then transactions will be cheaper again.

Bitcoin has zero value if you cannot use it to buy stuff and cannot exchange it for other currency that can buy stuff.

That actually worries me the most, that just rich people can afford bitcoin for speculation. This leads to a whole different type of centralization.

Most countries don't have the concept of checking and savings account. And most countries have nearly instant and free transactions (even though mostly within the country).

A month ago fees were still below 5 USD and bitcoin accessible to way more people.
Missing foresight of the core developers is the problem.
@_date: 2017-12-30 10:26:08
For the current block reward the fees are way too high and hinder adoption.
Fees can take over in 5-10 years time.
@_date: 2017-12-19 00:44:21
The more worrying thing is that if it takes so long for something as simple as segwit, it will take forever to get LN into use.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:17:05
I know, all these poor users are against Satoshi's vision of an elitist and centralized payment network.

eg Overstock.com and quite a few other merchants. Not as much acceptance as bitcoin but certainly growing.
@_date: 2017-12-08 14:20:15
They don't hate bitcoin, they hate the bitcoin core implementation because of other scaling preferences.

No worries, with the current fees you don't have to be worried to lose money to BCH. It will already be gone before you can exchange your BTC to BCH. 
@_date: 2017-12-20 23:21:08
This sub is so obsessed with BCH instead of working on urgently needed scaling solutions for BTC that were supposed to be ready half a year ago.
@_date: 2017-12-18 23:50:48
Transaction never disappear. 
The only way to make sure that a transaction is not mined at a later time is to spend the coins.
@_date: 2017-12-31 01:19:55
I use decentralization in terms of "how easy is it to attack and influence the bitcoin network". This also includes the costs to deanonymize users.
Without merchants and with government controlled exchanges it is very easy to control and influence the network. 
Fees directly affect the number of merchants as we have seen during the last year.
@_date: 2017-12-20 08:20:43
I know, who cares about mining centralization if you can have a elitist and centralized payment network for rich people? 
@_date: 2017-12-29 10:48:39
If Satoshi wanted Bitcoin to revolutionize transactions he would have called it "electronic cash" or something similar.

If you don't have insider information, don't trade.
If you want to gamble, there are special websites for this. On these websites you can choose whether you want double, triple or 10x return on your investment and it applies automatically the associated risk to your bet.

@_date: 2017-12-19 10:10:13
This is nonsense. Blocksize has been increasing linear before blocks started getting full beginning of this year.
Just 4 MB blocks would save us for a few years. Unfortunately people here don't like this because of political reasons and propaganda. 
@_date: 2017-12-21 04:13:41
So you want a decentralized pseudonymous payment network and at the same time you want it regulated by the government. Oh the delusion.
@_date: 2017-12-19 20:24:11
People don't even bother to go through bitcoin to buy cryptocurrencies. On Gdax people directly go for LTC, which already has a higher trade volume than BTC.
@_date: 2017-12-18 19:56:38
Would have been nice if there would have been ideas for a compromise to bridge the time until LN works. Like a small blocksize increase.
@_date: 2017-12-17 19:51:04
Bitcoin is not for the poor and un-banked! /s

You might have missed that bitcoin is not supposed to be used currently. Except you mean purchases &gt;$1000.
@_date: 2017-12-19 15:42:09
Segwit will never lead to 2MB+ blocks. This is wrong information.
@_date: 2017-12-31 07:02:50
Nonsense. The term "centralization" has been used in this forum for a long time to generate fear that bitcoin could be controlled and attacked by governments/companies/individuals.
I am using it in exactly the same way. It is totally irrelevant for this argument that there is a different more specific CS definition.
@_date: 2017-12-25 04:39:35
A correct minimum fee prediction cannot work because you cannot look into the future.

The biggest threat to bitcoin decentralization are the fees.
Merchants not accepting bitcoin anymore is a huge problem. Just being able to exchange bitcoin at a few centralized and government controlled exchanges will destroy it in the long term.

Hodl-coin is a Ponzi scheme. It would collapse if we run out of new buyers.
@_date: 2017-11-30 09:45:51
It can still be confirmed at any time in the future. Unless the sender does a double-spent by sending the coins to a different address. 
@_date: 2017-11-28 12:09:36
- Another technically more advanced cryptocurrency might take over the no1 spot
- Saturation of the buying market
- No new use cases besides store of value
- Government regulations of major regions (EU, USA)
- Critical failure of SHA256
Besides the last point none of these points would destroy bitcoin. But they would lead to significant corrections in market price.
@_date: 2017-11-23 22:57:00
There has never been any fraud reported using light wallets.
And if I suspect fraud or it is an important transaction I can still double-check manually by using a few different servers and/or online blockexplorers.

@_date: 2017-11-24 15:06:06
The most accumulated PoW on a one week average has always defined bitcoin and will always define bitcoin in the future. I am very happy to take bets on this.
Nobody will able to afford to manipulate PoW for longer than a few days without the economy following. Bitcoin is **not** defined by core or twitter polls or some magic undefined bullshit.
@_date: 2017-11-24 20:06:50
Because bitcoin does not have any value if it is just bought to keep it. Basic economics but unpopular opinion here.
@_date: 2017-11-24 21:49:02


You are cute to believe it is a coincidence. At lim(t-&gt;infinity) bitcoin will either be the coin with most PoW or it will be dead.

If the post was meant to be serious it is just delusional.
@_date: 2017-11-23 20:19:32
Light wallets are already described in the original bitcoin whitepaper and are ideal for beginners. Having beginners start with a full wallet is delusional.

It would be a waste of time arguing whether following the longest chain is fraud.


No, it is very simple statistics. The same reason I trust that the food in the supermarket is not poisoned. If someone would start to poison food in the supermarket there is a negligible small chance that I will eat it before it is reported.
If someone finds a way to mess with SPV servers it will be reported. And then I can still run a full node. However, &gt;300k correctly verified transactions per day make this risk much smaller than using my credit card.
@_date: 2017-11-23 21:59:45
Can you elaborate about the difference? 
@_date: 2017-11-28 21:08:14
