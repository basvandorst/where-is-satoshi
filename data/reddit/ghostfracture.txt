OP, if I were you I'd double check the tx ID he gave you and make sure he actually sent the payment. If he did, just credit him the purchase as a sign of good will and put up a disclaimer on your site warning any future customers not to do the same as their purchase won't go through.
If you just say sucks to suck, you're not only letting him get burned by bch and shrugging off crypto for good, you're tarnishing your reputation as a business since he could turn around and shit talk you to everyone.be the beacon.

Not using the same username on the darkweb, using VPN on top of TOR, not saving unncrypted Private keys on the same machine. Get a metal sheet and a letterpress, put your private keys in that and store it in a safe.
There's also the option of setting up your main btc wallet on an offline only computer and your other devices have watch only copies of that wallet so they're unable to spend anything if someone gains access to your main devices.

Adding on to this, pull your btc from coinbase to gdax and send to your btc wallet from there. Gdax is coinbase's exchange/trading platform and they dont charge fees for sending out btc.

@_date: 2017-11-25 02:48:39
On top of this, to get out of paying withdrawal fees when you want to send the btc to your own offline wallet, log into to gdax.com (coinbase's exchange), pull the coinbase btc and then send it from there. No charge.
@_date: 2017-11-28 20:21:42
Sign up for Bitwage instead. You can set up a portion of your paycheck to be paid out in bitcoin

See, Bitcoin getting so much mainstream attention is a double-edged sword.
So many people are exposed to it and the amount of people using it grew exponentially over the past few years... but so many of those people, and people who decided to watch rather than dive in, think that it's just like a stock and the only thing that matters is the price.
The price is irrelevant. It's the function we care about, people getting rich just happened to be a side effect.

Is that why Ver threw a violent rage fit when people referred to his shitcoin as Bcash? You're full of shit.
I have evaluated Bcash rather than following what I've been told, and it offers literally nothing of value. With segwit becoming mainstream and LN starting to roll out, Bcash offers nothing to the crypto space than a leech trying to take over the name of Bitcoin. It is a cancer that needs to be eradicated.
Just checked your profile history. Big surprise, you're a Bcash shill.
@_date: 2018-03-19 23:48:20
The Bitcoin fork happened because Roger Ver capitalized on Bitcoins growing pains last year. The popularity of BTC last year grew exponentially and the network wasn't prepared to handle it, but the solution (Segwit, LN) wasn't there just yet. Ver came up with a band-aid solution and marketed that intending to steal Bitcoin's identity.
Bcash is a scam coin.

Losses **are** to be expected with a hosted wallet that you don't control the private keys to. The entire point of Bitcoin is to put the control back in your hands. You invested and gave the control right back to someone else.

You can get paid BTC in America. I'll try to find the link, but you basically just set up as direct deposit (most employers let you set two+), and tie that to your BTC address. Your employer sends the paycheck and the third party buys the btc and sends it to you.
