It will be whether the people want to "let it" or not, it's one of the reasons I like it so much :)

I feel like it's worth mentioning that there has been an entity in the world funding wars for a long time now.....  
Everybody knows it; you can follow the money, the facts are all there.... funding both sides even!   
it's crazy what humans will do in the name of private enterprise and profit..... I don't think the medium for which "evil" people choose to do their financial transactions with matters too much..... except of course in the case of "criminals" making "counterfeit" dollar bills and the such.....   
The money the people use definitely needs to be practically impossible to counterfeit, most paper moneys -probably- have more illegitimate money in print than legitimate (It's for another day questioning the legitimacy of the legitimate stuff)......   
But really: any "criminal" entity that figured out how to counterfeit money would probably print as close to infinite money as they could with no concern for inflation and the such...... I've even heard stories of record keepers covering up how much money they estimate has been printed "off the record"..... for "the sake of the economy" they say.....   
It's one of the reasons I HODL all my BTC, the inverted inflation rate compared to fiat is just spectacular, and the -near impossible- level of difficulty to spoof the blockchain is kind of one of the required features of a currency... hilariously one that the current "legal tender" lacks...... I wonder who's getting "infinite rich" swapping those dollars for stuff......

\*is enjoying a second winter of GPU based heatsource;   
I don't work for the others anymore: mostly because I've had the time to learn enough that I can leverage knowledge for capitalism; it's nice,.... it's also given me some time to do some much needed reading; like tens of thousands of pages of A+ stuffs.... it's been a good time;   
I hope you get to live a good life someday, make changes in the lives of those around you, make some positive impacts in the world, read a book.  
But seriously; dollars have been fake money for a while; not to mention the rate of counterfeiting is absolutely ATROCIOUS.
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:20:23
dollars are fake money; It's kinda fun owning a little chunk of physical gold tho :P
@_date: 2019-01-25 07:12:50
Yeah, pretty sure the dominoes started falling a long time ago.....
@_date: 2019-01-25 08:25:40
yes they're the two different things, and in theory they -could- be used for great good!  
That being said: (insert the horrendously obvious paragraph here)  
but than again:
Who am I to judge the benevolence of authoritarian entities.....
