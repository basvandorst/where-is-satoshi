Actually, this is good news for bitcoin.

Buy when they're posting HODL, sell when they're posting MOON.
This is the 2017 version Buffett's "fearful when others are greedy and greedy when others are fearful" philosophy.

It's longs encouraging other longs not to sell out and continue to deflate the price.  Nothing more.

How 'bout now?

Furthermore, why waste your time converting USD-BTC if you're just paying a price stated in USD anyway?
BTC wants to be a currency, where prices are stated in BTC and people hold their value in BTC.  Until the value of BTC as a currency stabilizes, it'll never meet that goal.

So in order to maintain the same level of privacy that Visa offers, I just need three separate bitcoin accounts and two currency transfers?  Oh, is that all? :)

Yes, there's a HUGE gap between when you place your transaction and when it's carried out.  With stock/bond investing, that gap is measured in microseconds, or perhaps seconds if the servers are particularly busy.  With bitcoin, the unit of measurement is days.
During the run up on Monday, Coinbase was throwing a message that all purchase orders would be on hold until FRIDAY.  How can you day-trade a commodity when your orders take almost a week to close?

If you learned the pump and dump lesson for $200, drop to your knees and thank the stars that it happened to you at this point in your life, and not when you were playing with your retirement fund.
Seriously... a lot of people learn this lesson late.  You got out cheap.  Just don't get caught in the spike next time (and there will be a next time, and a time after that, and a time after that).

I learned it with a stock called LQMT in 2010.  Rumor spread that this small supplier had been signed by Apple to provide parts for the recently announced iPhone 4.  Same pattern... a huge spike, I got caught on the way up, and all the shareholders dumped.  A few weeks later, the owners sold the entire company.  I got washed for just shy of $6,000.
Too often, you can't explain this to people.  They have to see it for themselves.  Trading is an emotional game, especially for new traders.  It's too easy to say "that won't happen this time, the company/currency is too sound, there are too many people backing it.  It can't turn that fast."  Tough lesson to learn.

Maybe not.  If you don't believe that bitcoins will exist long-term, then take your $70 (or whatever it's trading at now) and go home.  Guess it's a question of what you believe about the currency and why you bought it in the first place.

I get 1% cash back on my Visa transactions, and you pay a transaction fee.  And your transactions are less anonymous than mine :)***

Merchants will never give you a discount for using bitcoin.  If that bit of fairy-tale logic were true, merchants would have been giving all of us discounts for using cash for the last 40 years :)***
Sure, there are pros to using bitcoins.  Just not many, and they're not terribly relevant in real life commerce.  For the moment, bitcoin is nothing more than a speculative commodity currency, manipulated for profit by the few and wealthy at the expense of the idealistic public.  
Basically the same as any other bank.

What you're seeing is allllllll the people who bought in at $10 taking their profits.  They'll run out of bitcoins to sell, eventually, and the stock will hit some support level (this is probably not it).  It'll coast there, gradually increase for a while, then some mainstream rag will publish another article and the hype train will start again.
You'll get your $200 back out, eventually.  Might take a month, six months, a year, five years.  The question is, do you wait, or do you take your $65 and use it for something else?
