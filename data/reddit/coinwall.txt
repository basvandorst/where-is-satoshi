Coinwall ( was probably the first. Give it a try--it is very easy to use and requires no registration.

Take a look at  .  There is an example on the homepage of how to use it to sell music, click "Paywall for music". We have a few people using it to sell music/media already:
- 
- 
Some nice features of the site:
- It is a copy/paste integration. 
- It's really easy for you, the seller. You enter a link to your song in the "hidden" section, and put a description in the "preview" section. Put in your bitcoin address for payments, and you are done.
- Super low friction for buyers. They just send BTC and the "hidden" section is revealed.
- You can host it on your site (copy/paste some javascript), or host it on our site (like the above links)

You are right--and actually since  was merged it is more like .5 cents, making micropayments much more viable (for now). I will update this.

It uses an &lt;a href="bitcoin:..."&gt; style link. Your computer is set to open "bitcoin:" links with bitcoin-core. I'm not sure why it would open a new instance though. If you have multiple versions of bitcoin-core installed, that would explain it.

Bitcoin makes paywalls much simpler to use, so publishers can consider that as well. My app  is one example.

The author, and others interested in this, may want to look my project  It's an easy paywall that uses bitcoin. Readers don't need to signup for an account, which relieves some of the burden that paywalls impose.
