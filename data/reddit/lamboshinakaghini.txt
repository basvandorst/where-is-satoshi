They spent millions on the data, but there is billions to be made running an inverse strategy.

Also, fiat isn't meant to be a store of value. It is supposed to be a high velocity medium of exchange. If you want to store value, buy gold, real estate, stocks, bonds etc.

Exactly. If you know how to use it to your advantage, it works great. I think it is a bit silly to compare Bitcoin to fiat as they are totally different designs. And at the risk of being banned I think the idea of Bitcoin replacing fiat as a world wide currency is very unlikely. I'm not saying it is worthless or anything; I'm just saying there is not much in the design of Bitcoin that makes it an effective currency.

He has 20 degrees bro. A guy with 27 degrees is definitely qualified to teach. While he was getting his 39 degrees he absolutely learned how "to do". A smart guy like him with 45 degrees can get a job making hundreds of millions of dollars a year. So him taking his 57 degrees, and deciding to teach instead isn't a last resort thing, it is a charitable move. He is giving up his massive money earning potential and passing the knowledge he gained from getting his 64 degrees and passing it on to the next generation of students. Students that don't even have 1 degree because they are imbeciles. He is a real smart guy. Those 0 degree morons should be honoured to be in the room with him and his 72 degrees.

I've seen pictures of this car before, and now that I know it is a Florida man that owns it, it all makes a lot more sense. 
It is a base V6 Camaro by the way. Total POS, and I don't mean proof of stake.

That's coinbase and gemini right now. Both are insured.

It's also assuming that everything other than bitcoin is worthless.

Yes this is a totally not intentional flaw. /s

Unfortunately denizen is already a word. So it wouldn't make much sense.

Maybe bitcoin should widen its scope.

That doesn't make mortgages obsolete though.
@_date: 2019-08-28 00:05:52
Do people that post shit like this think that banks are literally just offering savings accounts? Bitcoin does not replace most of the services banks offer. Bitcoin doesn't offer mortgages.

Supply does not decrease if electricity price goes up. If the electricity price goes up miners will shut down, and the difficulty will adjust and supply will stay flat.
@_date: 2019-12-29 18:07:36
Bitcoin will increasingly depend on extremely high fees over the next few halvenings to replace the mining subsidy that inflation gives. Fee revenue is a big deal for disinflationary POW coins to maintain security.
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:19:27
The price has nothing to do with electricity cost.
@_date: 2019-12-26 19:35:34
If that's the case you just stop mining... The cost of mining a Bitcoin does not put a floor on the BTC price.

There is definitely no back doors in it, the code has been checked well enough to know that much. And the contract has been live for almost a year now with no bugs so far, but if you can find one there is nearly 1 million eth (212 million dollars) locked up in it up for grabs so go right ahead and try to find one.

What exactly are you hoping for us to tell you? You have no wallet and login details to a scam exchange that shut down 5-6 years ago. I'm not seeing much of an angle here for troubleshooting.

Bitcoin's lack of expressiveness forces devs to resort to centralization and unconventional uses of Bitcoin code to create products that people want. Things like liquid, bitmex, bitpay etc. are awkward workarounds that are bodged together and/or are centralized. A slight increase in the attack surface of Bitcoin could greatly reduced the attack surface of the applications built on to of it that people are actually using. Those 3 products, and basically everything else should be directly on chain and non custodial. Not your keys, not your Bitcoin.

No, that's only when the fees are high. When fees are high bitcoin is purely  a store of value. When fees are low bitcoin is a currency for purchasing coffee. If you just keep moving the goal posts depending on the situation bitcoin cannot be criticized, it will always be working as intended.

Shame that there is no decentralized prediction market on bitcoin so that we can be sure that you will follow through on this.

There is no situation in which bitcoin could cause 89 billion dollars diversified across every type of investment except bitcoin to turn in to 0 even if he lives to be 150 years old. He is untouchable.

This has not been my experience. If I login then quicky go to withdraw it always tells me to wait for a new key to be generated. This is the case on the website at least. Maybe interacting through the API is different.
