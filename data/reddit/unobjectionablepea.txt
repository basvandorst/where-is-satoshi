Did you buy someone a pizza with it in 2010?  Because it's worth about $22,000,000 now

Come to think of it, if my house burned down today I'd be out nearly a million dollars.

@_date: 2017-11-01 10:14:33

Millionaire's row here I come
@_date: 2017-11-02 04:46:54
No, I have more.

The universe won't let that happen.  I'll be dead and free of pain.  
What the universe will allow is for it to crash minutes before I cash out.   So I can live the rest of my life knowing i just almost had it.  Just.  Almost. 
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:57:28
Yea, been doing it before that too.

It is not.  It is only a $166,000,000 value of the money supply in USD.   
What's hard to judge is where there will be equilibrium.  $500B? $1T?  Or back down to $100M?

Coins were valued at $41 that day.  $10 = ~1/4 of $41.    My math is still wrong, though, I went with 1/3.   I should have said $17 million.
@_date: 2017-11-02 13:55:41
Yes.  It is cvery clear it is a bubble and these idiots are all going to leave at the next crash
@_date: 2018-02-09 02:02:38
So a 4-5T money supply in USD.  
Interesting.  So 1/20 of all financial instrument in the world.  
Good luck with that.

Weird, my tea leaves this morning showed a distinct backwards hammer pattern facing towards Mercury.  That can only be read as an imminent Bitcoin crash but I will also be meeting a mysterious woman who will play a big role in a future unplanned trip.

The same can be said for most of the comments and posts on this sub.

Nothing makes you look like an expert more than by body shaming someone you disagree with.  &lt;/s&gt;
He has a doctorate degree in Economics from the University of Chicago and has risen to the position of  general manager of the Bank of International Settlements.  
What are your qualifications?  You opened a coinbase account?
@_date: 2018-02-14 14:33:08
Just saying, "I am stupid." would have gotten your point across more concisely.  
@_date: 2018-02-15 04:28:15


And yet he's risen to the role of general manager of the BIS;  was the Deputy Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund; and has been published by Columbia Journal of World Business, American Economic Review, Journal of Asian Economics, Journal of International Finance, Cuadernos Económicos del ICE (Spain) and Gaceta de Economía del ITAM (Mexico).
While you and the other losers of sit on this sub, without any formal education in economics nor finance, offer the superb critique of his reasoning on the sole basis that he's fat. 
You are a retard.  The sad thing is you are too much of a retard to know that you're even that ignorant.

I completely agree with this.  Why wouldn't you?  "Most" is not "all".  Fine, maybe many linger on with some value... but consider them like penny stocks.  They are niche and non mainstream.  But get traded by people for whatever reason.
However the majority of the market will be held by only a few players.  Right now I'd say BTC, LTC, ETH, BCH, and which ever one is getting slowly adopted on the darknet (monero?) for its anonymization.  That's five?  Doge for the novelty so that is six.  Maybe a few more.
Five is a far cry from the 100+ that are out there right now.  The rest of those alt coins will have very little value overall.  That is "most".

For fuck sakes people, just  because someone talks about bitcoin it doesnt mean you need to validate them and give them a platform.  This douchebag and Fatboy Dotcom are two prime examples of people who should be completely ignored and shunned from the community.
ESPECIALLY when it comes to financial instruments like BTC ... hooligans, scammers, and con men are the absolute LAST people you want anywhere near being associated with.

Also that article was laughed at when it came out.  Interestingly, it was written by someone who wrote a really good book about his experience tracking down a hacker.  But that Clifford Stoll quote should be removed.  There's many better examples from more prominent people than a guest writer at Newsweek.

Not in your lifetime.  Maybe in some sci-fi scenario where governments of the world have broken down to one world order, and humans have colonized mars.  If it got to that point it would probably be replaced by something else anyhow.  In other words: no.  Not ever.
