funny how all this monkey business started when bitcoin hit over 100 USD, when it was 2 USD no one gave a shit to sue anyone or to call for resignation. This is why we can't have good things.

omg, I wish I knew it before. I have total of 84 transactions now, i/e. one cent gift cards. For me this is a big disadvantage of bitcoin, so basically every transaction you receive will have its own fee? I was under the impression that BTC accumulate in lump sum and transaction fee is applied to it all, not every frigging tiny part of it. WTF is that? I cannot belive it is true! I do not see any point in bitcoin then, especially for a small guy.

confirmation bias go a long way, especially when people are clueless and buy into this entire "gold rush" aspect of bitcoin. I just saw the announcement of 300 M/hs USB miner for an auction, min order 300 pcs, auction will mean 3-4 BTC final price. And these wide eyed suckers will be buying this shit. 
Pitfalls of BTC are downvoted to hell here, this brouhaha is getting on my nerves, once in a while I see some timid posts of poor suckers saying they have been robbed, or they bought BTC @ 200 and shit like that, they are told they are idiots and downvoted. 
And this China shit, I mean I have weibo account, I see the chat, some are like wtf is bitcoin and why do we need it, and others like we gonna have our own china coin. Pffft

@_date: 2013-05-06 12:17:34
why are you comparing it to fiat? Isn't bitcoin supposed to be better, more divisible and all that shit? Now suddenly micro-transactions will not fly, what else users like me do not get? I am just glad I did not buy into  brouhaha and did not buy any useless  bitcoins. Last night 4000 ppl used the faucet I used, and I bet you none of them has any clue about this issue with transaction fee. 
@_date: 2013-05-01 16:02:31
you do not get it, many people are turned away because of calculations how it is not "profitable". They miss the entire point. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 23:33:03
ewww, lol. But yes, right to the point. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 21:59:13
I do not understand, so if I get stuff like small rewards from faucets they will be blocked and my bitcoin wallet will not receive them?
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:19:12
I still do not get it. This means that tip jars are worthless and also means that small transactions are penalized. For example, I am a small nonprofit and collect donations. The transactions are small, so I end up paying more in fees than I am being donated??
This is like a fatal flaw. What is the point of divisibility of bitcoin, when small transactions do not make any sense. It also means that someone who gets many small transactions pays more fees than a fat cat who just got 100 btc in one go. Like wtf is that? Bitcoin is useless for a small guy. Do ppl realize this? Cause I definitely did not. 
@_date: 2013-05-05 22:15:45
Faucets have been a great way to promote bitcoin and tip jars are very good idea too. Why would someone take it away like this? What about small transactions for mining shares and other similar small stuff? I remember distinctly how the divisibility of bitcoin has been promoted as an awesome part of its set up, etc 
I also do not like how it is done, what will happen next? What if someone else will decide to change stuff tomorrow? How will businesses adjust to things like that? Not only bitcoin is volatile so you have to adjust price all the time, now some random people can change stuff as they see fit at any moment in time. 
I am poor and I have been using faucets to get some bitcoin, and now even this is taken away from me. Not nice. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:13:51
nah, whatever, bitcoin sux. 
@_date: 2013-04-28 15:41:20
excuse me, but how an average user, like grandma Doris could do something like that?? 
Even for me "create paper wallets on linux booted laptop" sounds like Chinese, and I know more than her. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:20:50
then faucets are scam and ppl need to know about it. 
@_date: 2013-05-04 22:27:12
I think this autistic bitcoin fest needs to stop. Everyone needs to realize that bicoin could flop like there is no tomorrow at any moment in time. Alternatively it could  be pushed away by PP coin, QQ coin or whatever hell next coin will be. 
I realize that the sole purpose of this subreddit is to pump bitcoin, but please dear redditors, take everything posted here with a grain of salt. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:45:44
and look! This thread is being downvoted, meaning poor clueless suckers like me will not see it. Nice. 
I cannot buy a bitcoin at 120 a piece, sorry. I was trying to get some bitcoin by doing some work for shitty websites and now I have to jump through hoops if I want to send and spend this crap. I could not believe no one talks about it. I have been here for 2 months now and have not seen a single discussion about this. 
Now what will happen when ASIC mining starts and difficulty sky rockets? The BTC miners in pools will be getting will be compatible to faucets' pay offs. Are ppl aware of that? The ones who buy 300 M/hs USBs and Jellies??

Bitcoin is the amazing thing, because it shows humans who they really are. It has a potential to benefit many or to benefit the few. It was released in its virgin way for humans to fuck up with, and boy have we been fucking with it. I sometimes think Satoshi had a bet with someone whether or not humanity is essentially greedy and selfish and will always mess everything up. Satoshi was like, yes they are greedy and let me prove it to you. Here, this is a bitcoin, I am releasing it to the wild and just you watch what they will do with it. Point proven.

Stop shitting your pants over this, just checked weibo chat and the crowd is not shitting their pants like all of you. Half is asking wtf is bitcoin and why the hell we need it and another half goes like, hey, it is open code, we gonna have our own china coin with  mining, exchanges and all perks. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:32:08
I do not think the majority of ppl even realize this, because no one spends it now as mainly speculation is going on. I am glad I learned about it, so I can abandon these useless faucets now. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 12:13:04
screw it then, bitcoin is not what I thought it was. 
@_date: 2013-05-06 01:24:20
I made 0.015 so far and no I have not spent anything yet. I was under the impression that all these transactions accumulate in my wallet and when I spend my 0.015 for example the transaction fee will be applied to 0.015 and not every tiny faucet reward I got. Am I wrong???
@_date: 2013-05-05 16:49:44
funny how this gets downvoted, ppl do not like to hear about this
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:35:52
what is a transaction fee for 5 transactions 0.00006 worth each? 
@_date: 2013-05-06 11:34:12
geez, how cumbersome is that! How long does the no fee transaction take? 
we need to talk about this, as I am positive less tech savvy folks like me are clueless about this aspect and could be up for a nasty surprise.

it was done already, fascinating stuff, because it even involved seminary students who supposed to be prosocial and helping by default.

@_date: 2013-05-06 10:43:23
wut? Are you serious? Let me clarify it then. Lets say I got 10 rewards from faucet, each is 0.00006 BTC. So my total is 0.0006 BTC. Now I wanna spend it, I send 0.0006 to someone and **EACH of my** 0.00006 parts gets its **OWN fee**? WTF? There will be 10 fees? 
If this is true, then bitcoin is not what I thought it was, this is bullshit, it penilizes a small guy. What is a point of a tip jar then or any small transaction??

@_date: 2013-04-27 13:01:59
yes, and then watch bitcoin plummet down, or being stolen from you of it shoots up. Either way you lose. Donate it to a charity, save the fucking rainforest in Brazil, dont be a fucking piece of shit.
