The suggestion here (and my understanding) is that once you made the profit selling your bch to btc, and paid taxes on the dollars earned, you don't pay tax on the conversion to bitcoin if it didn't appreciate in value since then. 
If you sold bch for 1500 in profit, then you pay tax on your 1500 capital gains. If you sell bch for 1500 of btc, you pay tax on that 1500 capital gains, but it's free to then transfer to USD (for 1500) there's no double taxation involved

Just for curiosity then, what does a quarter of a Philippine Peso buy you?

Not a lawyer or in the US (most tax discussions base there) but I believe your bch is just a bonus from your btc investment- if you put 1k in to a bitcoin you have a 10k capital gain on the btc and 1.6k gain on the bch - both are profits from that initial investment, regardless of how they happened

Many modern countries have removed the penny and 2p, and round to the nearest 5 - it's not true in the US because many global consensus things are implemented too slow there, but it doesn't mean the penny is actually neccesary, especially not in a currency that costs $5 to transact in

As someone holding a fair amount of doge, I really don't think it is the coin to invest in. Doge only does so well because it is hilarious monopoly money, once 1 doge has any value by itself it stops having value in a horrible paradox situation. Maybe it catches on as something more, but with a name like doge coin I don't see it realistically being a serious currency. Gone are the days of 10000% returns on a bitcoin, but you can easily make a 500% plus return in a year at this point on what is an almost sure shot (there will always be people valuing it at what it is now and preventing a fall) it's still a near insane investment in the real world, but far far less insane than dogecoin or anything which is literally useless except for it's *lack* of value

bitcoins which will be next to worthless after the double spend, and which  no one would let you spend.

If it hits even $0.03 then the coins I made mining in 4 hours near the start would be worth over $1,000

but you should bare in mind if you're the type of person willing to spend money to skip ads, you're probably worth more than $0.01, since that's aggregate across all demographics.
I don't have access to click through rates for YouTube, but you can probably imagine single digit percentages
@_date: 2014-02-19 10:44:00
You are correct.

As a YouTube partner with around 500,000-1,000,000 views a month, Google makes around $10-$20 per thousand ad playing views, and then gives 55% of that to the user (or whoever has a claim on the video) or 0% for a lot of mobile platforms. 
Basically, $0.01/ad skip would lose them money

There are multichannel networks (I am part of one) that manage and sell ads, in that case they take a % (commonly 30) from your post-google earnings

Woah man, I'm a different guy to whoever came before. I think telling me I'm arguing for a safe space because I pointed out a couple of issues with your argument  (on r/bitcoin which incidentally is the closest thing to a "bitcoin safe space" ) says something interesting. Best of luck with the investment, I hope it works out well for us both!

It's a weird world when a message telling people not to borrow money to invest in highly volatile investments is down voted. 
@_date: 2019-09-14 11:34:45
So it's part owned by some entities that are part owned by private entities?

So I've held bitcoin and browsed this place for maybe 3-4 years now, and this whole post is a little rude to be truthful. You're making unfair comparisons, because you don't want to admit there's *any* chance your investment could reach 0. 
Yes fiat money can reach 0 too, but people don't invest in the same way, if there was a deflationary fiat currency in the world perhaps that'd be a fair point. You raise the point of other crypto again as if it's proof it's fool proof but how many of those currencies have gone to 0?
We all believe some amount in this, you shouldn't shout someone down for believing there is risk, if there wasn't risk then why aren't we all 100% in on bitcoin?
@_date: 2015-11-04 21:03:58
You raise a good point I hadn't thought about before, people assume that the end supply of bitcoin will be 21,000,000 and make valuations on that, but the reality is the number of workable coins is probably never going to pass 20,000,000.
Is it worth trying to calculate and adjust for though? Should we knock 1% of the market cap?

He's come up a lot of times in this sub reddit and for the longest time I couldn't work out why people were so excited when he said things

The monarchy in britain pretty much doesn't exist. She technically has power to do things, but never does and never will. We keep the monarchs because they make us a lot more money than they cost.
