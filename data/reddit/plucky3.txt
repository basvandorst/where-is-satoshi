The point is that we want NXT to grow not some competitor who just c&amp;p's the code.
The source is open source 
Only some very advanced features are not at this point.

Having a lot of money gives you control over the bitcoin network.
Because with money you can buy mining equipment.
@_date: 2014-01-23 15:36:15
That is wrong, I have been thinking that for a while as well..
But actually it is backed by its utility, nothing else.
Nobody gives a shit about the energy that was necessary to mine them  it's just a blatant way of securing the network.
What it comes down to is Proof of Work, and the *Proof of* part is really important.
The list of possibilities of securing a network ends where your imagination ends.
Proof of Stake
Proof of Burn
Proof of Bandwidth
Proof of x
Since the cryptocurrency thing is amazingly interesting I spent hours and hours of learning about it.
That's the latest chapter of my research.
Proof of X

That's maybe because the topic is fucking complicated and there is nothing in history you can relate it to :D

"It will probably seem obvious." 
Good one, so true :)
@_date: 2014-01-22 22:05:16
People crave to associate things with events from our history, this makes sense but can lead to horribly wrong estimations.
We have to agree on a few things here:
Is cryptocurrency going to play a big role in the future?
I think those quite deeply involved (including me) would answer with: Yes!
We are obviously those who can measure it's potential, we have the knowledge.
The 2nd thing we have to decide is where we should put our money?
3.Cryptocurrency company
I can't quite answer this but, since I'm quite deeply involved as I said, I see the biggest potential in Bitcoin itself.
I'm also invested in Nxt (2nd gen crypto - low radar).
Crazy potential. Seriously.
Regarding the company's, I don't have a clue which one will be a big successor later on.
Just wanted to share my thoughts :)

Ah okay, and why would I use XCP?
Is any exchange listing it already?

NXT is growing at an surreal rate without any money.
Just people with ideologies and therefore an astounding motivation.
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:02:17
I can agree with that, a friend of mine had to jump out as well cause he needed the money, with 20% loss, now he would have made profit ~

Good idea man, good idea.. :D
@_date: 2014-01-30 16:27:46
A descendant on Bitcoin.
Improves upon many aspects, just like altcoins do.
Only that Nxt is not an altcoin but a completely new protocol.
(Other alts usually take the Bitcoin protocol and modify it slightly)
@_date: 2014-01-12 23:52:26
Obfuscate it if you want and see for yourself, only the part with the transparent forging is closed source at the moment. 
And this makes sense perfect sense if you think about it.
@_date: 2014-04-24 22:05:42
I had practically the same idea a few months ago :)
Bitcointalk is a brainstorming of great ideas, hadn't gotten any replays to that one unfortunately.
I also lack the technical expertise to implement the concept.
Awesome to see these things develop ! :)

Nxt is implementing true anonymity in the protocol layer.
@_date: 2014-01-06 11:58:04
How can we push the devs to implement this?
I is so essential!
@_date: 2014-02-04 20:24:22
So basically a decentralised asset exchange?
You can color coins within the XCP protocol, right?
@_date: 2014-01-06 14:45:55
The heat is going to come. 
You have to understand that this decision will have massive impacts later on.
@_date: 2014-01-26 14:42:03
It allows for instant transactions, messaging, aliases, assets, voting, transaction volumes like visa and mastercoin, transparent forging etc. pp. (sorry you won't get around reading about it, if you want to truly understand it).
@_date: 2014-06-05 22:24:25
But if you are realistic about it litecoin is kinda useless, watching out for coins with much higher technical potential might be a good idea! :)
Nxt.. just sayin' :D
@_date: 2014-11-01 11:49:05
Yeha that's true, I think it's just gonna take time until the idea begins to make more and more sense, with more documentation available as well.
@_date: 2014-01-05 19:53:14
Look out for NXT. (Nextcoin as some call it)
@_date: 2014-01-18 12:16:09
And those who are deeply involved sometimes question their investment just because the vast majority of the people in their environment call it a "stupid investment".
But if you know that you're ahead in knowledge those things shouldn't frighten you.
@_date: 2014-01-10 16:33:15
This is true but somehow many people have trouble understanding that.

@_date: 2014-01-26 02:16:13
Poor Anon66666 got so many downvotes.
I'm always being downvoted when I bring Nxt(coin) to the table.
It will play a big role in the cryptoworld in the future.
If you want information about it:

"The original stakeholders are hoarding their coins"
"This is demonstrably false. The genesis block contains 73 transactions, distributing all 1 billion Nxt among the original stakeholders for the platform. Analysis of the weekly balances in those accounts, performed by wesleyh, shows that the balances have all dropped significantly:

Problem with ripple is that it is not decentralised, the currency might be, but do you think the currency will survive when the company behind it dies?
It is definitely a good gateway atm but not a currency which I would want.
I don't know much about eMunie, it seems interesting.
But I also have the feeling that a company is behind it, right?
Is there a good information pool about it?

If noon would have spoken about Bitcoin or Litecoin in its early days it wouldn't be where it is now.
It's hard to dismiss facts.
And yes I want to pump it.

English is not my native tongue either, fortunately I was able to learn it trough the internet (a lil bit trough school) :D
If I wasn't able to understand English I couldn't participate in such cool innovative things.
If you invest in something you should at least understand it to some degree.
I think both bitcoin and NXT will keep growing exponentially in the future.

Do you think regulatory issues regarding bitcoin will resolve with time?

Actually bitcoin is essentially built on PoW therefore I don't think this will be possible.
There is only one 100% PoS currency out there, it will become a big competitor to bitcoin, it is quite user unfriendly right know but that will change.
It is called NXT. 
If you want to learn more about it go to:
@_date: 2014-01-09 00:50:38
I wasn't criticising you, I know what you described. 
Having Bitcoin as kind of a token is in my opinion very far down the list tho, but it's on the list :D
And a smaller price then know is possible of course, but not likely in the long term.
@_date: 2014-01-10 13:53:43
"Nxt is a scam because all Nxt coins are pre-mined"
"First, it's important to note that Nxt is a 100% Proof-of-Stake (PoS) coin. The only way to implement this form of currency is to issue all available coins in the genesis block. To do otherwise would force the implementation of some form of Proof-of-Work scheme in order to prevent attacks on the network that "fake" stake. Since the creator of Nxt wanted a 100% PoS platform, this was not a desirable course of action. Second, the term "pre-mined" is a misnomer because Nxt coins are not mined at all.  The original stakeholders in Nxt contributed Bitcoin in order to seed the creation of the 1 billion coins represented in the genesis block, and these coins were distributed among the original stakeholders.  The stakeholders are expected to distribute coins by donating them, using them as "bounties" to pay for work on the coin (software, documentation, translations, support, etc.) that is done by the community. Even the creator of Nxt (BCNxt ) made an investment.  The coins were not generated from nothing! Third, the creation of the genesis block was fully public, and all of the original account numbers and their assigned amounts of Nxt are visible: see 
Like with every technology, these who come first get the biggest reward.
@_date: 2014-06-06 00:51:29
You haven't read really far then :D
@_date: 2014-01-10 14:34:03
That is a problem with currency in general.
I don't know how to solve that.
Nobody really does...
We could switch to a resource based economy but that's not going to happen in the foreseeable future.
It's the same thing with bitcoin, those with the money can buy the ASICs.
The accumulation of wealth won't be too disruptive with low fees.
Less disruptive as with bitcoin mining for sure
@_date: 2014-02-10 10:47:19
"Note that this will also affect any other crypto-currency using the same transaction scheme as Bitcoin."
Basically every cryptocurrency except Nxt.
It's about time to join the Nxt crypto movement... ;)
@_date: 2014-01-08 21:18:45
And that implies that it actually can't ever be worthless.
And if it's not going to be worthless it's going to be a lot bigger than it is now. 
It's user potential is at 0,01%.
That makes it actually quite obvious that it will be worth a lot.

I don't really understand XCP.
You can Burn a certain amount of Bitcoin to get XCP (1 BTC for 1000 XCP atm I think)
Of what does this "exchange rate" consist of?
And for what would I use XCP?
@_date: 2014-02-20 16:46:40
There might be clients out there which allow for double spend attempts. (If not you have to write your own)
Then other nodes check whether the same transaction has already been broadcasted.
I was talking about "double spend attempts".

NXT might gradually grow and maybe even to a level where it overtakes bitcoin, simply because it's way superior. 
Not just superior but way superior.
Fact is that all these useless alt-coins which do not change things fundamentally won't overtake bitcoin, that really is quiet obvious indeed.
I know I will get downvotes and stuff, but that's just because you don't really know what NXT is.
@_date: 2013-12-27 00:45:12
You don't know shit about NXT and your judging it anyway. 
It's a classic phenomenon. 
Im not trying to judge you either, it's good do be critical, the next step would be to inform yourself.
Until you do the next step you fail.
