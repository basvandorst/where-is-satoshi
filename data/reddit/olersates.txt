It doesn`t matter if it falls to 5800 or even 4500 for some time; I`d suggest You to look long, so it won`t be a difference when BTC hit 100K (2020).
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:31:43
It is not but I do not care. It is not important in all.
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:48:02
coinbase should be the best choise, however it will need some time to get verified if You don`t have an account yet.
If You want to enter faster You can use debit card-&gt;paypal-&gt;virwox and You can buy them instantly however the price will go much higher.

In 2011 it was a lost for me but not financial lost!
After that I have re-installed the system at least twise untill 2014-2015 when I got a new machine, so not - it`s not possible to restore these files.
Anyway I dont lost a million in any way - Im pretty sure Id sell in 2013 if I didnt lost them, so I its not such a problem.
Whats important here is that we were not able to predict the dificulty increasing and it bring later to a separation between miners and owners. It made the relations between us and that currency similar to the relations with any other currency - You buy, sell, trade but it is not like to CREATE AND BE A PART OF.

It is easy - just wait till dec 2021 - and You will have the great opportunity to buy for at least 500K
@_date: 2018-09-24 13:38:44
It will be back at the end of the year. It`s native position is not below 60%
@_date: 2018-09-29 14:55:56
1) As a company: allow Your customers to pay with BTC, in 2020 discontinue to accept fiat anymore for Your products/services
2) As an individual - do ever preffer to buy a product/service with BTC if possible instead of fiat. 
@_date: 2018-09-25 20:51:56
Of course You can withdraw BTC anytime - go to Accounts - BTC wallet - send -- &gt; so send to any other wallet You have.
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:30:48
I do ever have that problem with the use of "`". Edited.
@_date: 2018-09-18 17:50:58
How do You made that conclusion?
@_date: 2018-09-25 11:51:08
YES, it will stay as Microsoft Windows which was the first user friendly interface to communicate with a computer system. BTC is the first blockchain based product with an ability to be used as a currency and will stay as a measurment for every new digital cirrency. I can not say anything about how it will go after 50 years but I`m 100% sure for the next 15.
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:53:41

@_date: 2018-09-25 15:42:16
OK, may be the paralell is not the right one. Directly to the answer: BTC will stay as it "it's more typical of a precious metal. Instead of the supply changing to keep the value the same, the supply is predetermined and the value changes. As the number of users grows, the value per coin increases. It has the potential for a positive feedback loop; as users increase, the value goes up, which could attract more users to take advantage of the increasing value."
    S. Nakamoto, February 18, 2009
It will not be abandoned (which could be the only possible reason to not go higer and higher price) next 15 years (at least) as we need a measurement for all the rest blockchain projects. It is favorited by the people, well-known and a lot of investors are already involved.
@_date: 2018-09-26 20:57:11
Absolutelly NOT true! Some BANKS don`t allow such purchases, not coinbase. If You have a problems, just open account in other bank. I have purchased few hours ago with no problems from coinbase.

So finally You`ll be able to conclude that the "whales mythology" is absolutelly NONSENSE! It have its reasons for the early 2012/13 but not anymore. The MARKET RULES and it`s an obsercation I have from more than an year - the big owners do not move/play with their BTC, we have very rare cases for huge movements last year and they are very visible and widely discussed once happen.
@_date: 2018-09-22 17:30:09

2011 it was widely mentioned at various places.
I found it in early 2010 in some IT forums where I`m pretty frequently. I have been involved and have mined about 80-90 BTC myself on a pretty ugly machine :)
Unfortunatelly in opposite of You I havn`t made any money yet from crypto as I lost the HD in 2011 and never mined again as it already started to eat a lot of resources.. I`m back again of course in 2017 Dec :D

I`m not sure about the individuals, but BULGARIAN GOVERNMENT even at that moment IS one of the biggest BTC holders:
crime by Bulgarian law enforcement resulted in the seizure of more than 200,000 bitcoins - 
BTW talking about the downtrend: imagine they are cashing out 200K BTC from february!
@_date: 2018-08-06 10:53:42
More than the fiat?!! LoL
@_date: 2018-08-12 09:54:46
We are still at 5-10 years from the first working quantum computer. When it works I doubt the owner (institutional or academic or serious business) will use it to compromate the blockchain; once it could be available for more public use, the blockchain will be ready with updates done by same quantum computers to secure and IMPROVE the blockchain. 
Probably one consequence could be that the use of quantum computers for mining will lower dramatically the miner`s costs, however it`s unclear if it will affect the price at that moment. 
For sure we will have FASTER transactions, enourmous transactions per second handle and more security with the quantum computers.
@_date: 2018-08-09 21:23:05
I`d look in the span of 24 months :)
@_date: 2018-08-08 20:02:44
Don`t play shrort; BTC is a long term investment, after 5 year it will no matter if You bought at 10-15000 or 6500, both cases You`ll have x10-x15 returns
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:38:37
Sure it does! Another data same way will show Nakamoto is from US not from Japan :)

@_date: 2018-08-11 21:09:26
I`m really sorry to hear that.
I`m not sure if You can get Your mining rewards, but You surelly can get Your paid fee back - at least I hope You have an invoice for that payment; so with it just go to a local lawyer if they reject to return it back.

So they have used Your bank account to make a purchase or how?
It`s for sure they can not do via debit/credit card as it needs additional steps by Your side.
@_date: 2018-08-04 17:39:54
Yes, and surprisely it will happen much more sooner than everyone expect.

@_date: 2018-08-11 15:55:38
shortterm must start some bullrun today or tomorrow, midterm is bearish and will touch at least 5800, longterm is ABSOLUTELY BULLRUN with expectations at least 50K in 2020.

I`d be prepared to wait for two years, of course it may rise much more soon however after couple of years we will be able to see the real price of the virtual gold and/or currency.
Do not give up if next few months and/or 2019 it go to $3900-$4500 range; it`s possible but it`s NOT the real price and we will see at leasy 50K in 2020.
I hope You did that investment as a long term and Yo don`t need the money soon; if so I think near 20th of the next month You`ll have much better price due to the SEC decision date, however after 30th it may go deep down if not passed (or much more up if pass). Anyway it will be better to stay for long.
@_date: 2018-08-07 21:10:47
It will be back high for sure, however not overnight. Rather it will take an year from now.
@_date: 2018-08-05 14:14:17
Nope, it`s 696969.69 !
@_date: 2018-08-12 10:04:51
Yes FOR SURE, however it really needs to mature a little bit more; once we have an financial/bank institutions which handle BTC and when a bitcoin address could be connected via KYC for its owner and such connection is maintained by the bank (as your bank account) and every transaction has known sender-recipient.. 
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:22:30

The collapse as far as it`s global will affect bitcoin MORE than the fiat. It`s not a parallel existing system, the BTC owners will turn it into fiat when they have no other incomes or when their incomes are tighten. It will drop the BTC price dramatically and even could bring the end of the crypto market. You better hope the real collapse to be avoided; fortunatelly the last big crysis happened 2006, before the BTC time. If it happen today, the people first will withdraw their savings inc. crypto.
@_date: 2018-08-06 12:20:47
You can ever share Your portfolio with no risk via coinliker.com. However it will need manual action to update it when trade, I don`t think You can find safe way to show directly Your portfolio in exchanegs; Moreover many of us are trading on many exchanges not just in one..
@_date: 2018-08-13 20:59:55
Sure, it will be $100 in four years.

@_date: 2018-08-04 12:10:24

The truth: Starbucks spokesperson: “It is important to clarify that we are not accepting digital assets at Starbucks. Rather the exchange will convert digital assets like Bitcoin into US dollars, which can be used at Starbucks,” ... “At the current time, we are announcing the launch of trading and conversion of Bitcoin. However, we will continue to talk with customers and regulators as the space evolves.”
..“Customers will not be able to pay for Frappuccinos with bitcoin,” the spokesperson wrote.

That`s the main idea of bitcoin. ~~If~~ WHEN fiat disapear the volatility problem will be resolved. With the lightning network the transaction time problem has been resolved. We still have to solve the transaction fee problem and once it is done we will be ready for the btc dominance for everyday use.

For sure ADA owners in at least 70% keep their amounts in exchange (binance). So that`s the reason we can`t see many active wallets. I`m not sure about TRX but it must be some similar situation.

BUY!! (and HOLD od course)
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:01:53
Virvox is the best one. However the fees are relly high as You have first to convert BTC to linden dollars and than LD to dollars and send to paypal. As well You will start with very limited amonths to trade daily (don`t remember how much exactly) but they goes higher and hogher with every transaction You do.
Anyway Virvox is legit and I use it from years with no problems.
@_date: 2018-10-01 15:04:06
No sense to speculate as it`s too early to predict such a thing.

At the time quantum computing will bacome true BTC will be (almost) 100% mined. 
Anyway the value of the currency is not based on how much it cost to produse it. How much it costs to do a $100 banknote? - less thn a cent - anyway it cost $100 bcz of completely different reasons than the production costs.
@_date: 2018-10-06 08:30:45
Yes, of course! In that point in nevermind if You`re bitcoiner or just an investor: it`s a pure participation into the mass adoption.

Never. Some banks may block such transaction, but never will lock the account.
Anyway I will rather recommend You to use a debit card instead of credit (by the above reason). They never block a transaction of a debit cards. Some time ago I had an issue with a card which was ever accepted before but seems the bank changed its politics and when I tryed to buy in a very deliceious dip the transactions was rejected! Next day I just funded my debit card but the moment was lost.
