Just a few months ago it the exact opposite.

The funny part to me is that there's actually great the potential for crypto-currency and smart contracts to facilitate the type of collectivism that they would drool over. There's no government oversight needed for large groups of people to pool their resources when you have trustless smart contracts. Seems like r/latestagecapitalism might be interested in learning more, right? Nope, if you have anything to do with crypto-currency you're a child molester according to them. Wilfull ignorance is the worst kind of ignorance...

Personally, I think they just want to complain from their chairs about how hard and unfair life is instead of thinking critically (or maybe actually doing something) about how to change it. They prefer to just sit around and circlejerk about 1st world problems. If we can figure out real solutions to problems facing the world, then it will go against their narrative of them being oppressed.

Time to take a vacation to Hawaii and fund it by selling Bitcoin there
@_date: 2017-02-09 22:23:49
So basically its the same as most of the other exchanges....

The biggest advantage other currencies have over Bitcoin, in my opinion, is adaptability. Who knows what kind of advancements are coming in the next 10-20 years? Maybe many, maybe none. Don't you consider the possibility that Bitcoin might be obsolete, or at least technologically many years behind some other coins, by then?   
@_date: 2017-02-02 17:53:31
It takes like 5 days to clear for me, but you're locked in at the price it was when you clicked buy so it's not a big deal IMO.

Are you planning on keeping your Bitcoin for a year or more? Go ahead and buy now. 
It's really hard to guess the short term fluctuations of Bitcoin. There are too many factors at play. Some would say that now is a good time to buy because the Chinese have been manipulating the market to be lower than it should be. Some might say that you should wait until next month because if the SEC decides not to allow the Bitcoin ETF then the price will likely dip. If they do allow it, you can expect the price to increase.
Markets are really hard to time. Especially one as volatile as Bitcoin. As long as you're not going to chicken out and sell all your Bitcoin at the first sign of a downturn, go ahead and buy whenever you want. A lot of people here recommend buying a little bit every week (or even every day if you can afford it) to get a good average.

Depends on how and where you live really. If you invest that 1 mil, and earn a conservative estimate of 5-6 percent per year off it, that's 50-60k a year. If you go outside the major cities, that's a pretty comfortable life. Or you can retire in south east Asia and live like a king lol. 
Of course, 5-6 percent is a pretty conservative figure, and you could easily make more. And if you had a part time job or side business doing something you enjoy, then it would go a lot further.

So if someone figures out a way to to secure their network with low hashrate, then Bitcoin might have some real competition? 
@_date: 2017-02-09 23:06:07
Ok that actually does sound pretty cool for those interested in doing really short term trades. 
@_date: 2017-02-23 02:15:39
Things you shouldn't brag about on the internet
@_date: 2017-02-18 01:08:19
Why not bet on it by just buying more Bitcoin?
@_date: 2017-02-06 08:50:16
It would allow more organizations to invest in Bitcoin which would likely drive overall demand for it (and Bitcoin value) up. It would also probably attract more investors that are interested in Bitcoin, but don't feel comfortable dealing with all the technical stuff and would rather let someone more knowledgeable manage the Bitcoin they invest in. 
  
@_date: 2017-02-08 17:31:13
Is there some way to set up a notification when Bitcoin dips? An email or app that will alert me? Seems like I keep missing the dip.
@_date: 2017-02-13 19:39:56
Yeah it's possible to be enthusiastic about Bitcoin but even more excited about other applications for blockchain tech.  
@_date: 2017-02-18 02:57:35
All of the comments are so ignorant...
@_date: 2017-02-12 16:33:30
Yeah you wouldn't have to worry about this. You won't be vulnerable to these ransomware things if you don't have any valuable files on your computer that aren't also backed up elsewhere. You can just reformat and be good as new. A lot of ransomware infections I've seen are fake anyway, or have already been cracked by some awesome people who put up instructions on getting rid of it. 
And in any case, you shouldn't have to worry about your hardware wallet if you keep it offline.

It's risky to trade a non refundable Bitcoin for a PayPal transfer that can be disputed.
It would be nice if there was a service that allowed people to buy and sell Bitcoins through PayPal, credit and/or debit though. 
 
@_date: 2017-02-09 21:17:14
Are your funds immediately available for transfer?

Good article arguing for the viability of Bitcoin in general, but I don't see where the $2000 price comes into it. I'm optimistic, but putting a specific price on it just seems like pure speculation to me. Especially considering how much Bitcoin seems to struggle maintaining momentum past the $1000 mark.    
@_date: 2017-02-08 18:01:04
Ok yeah. I feel dumb for just noticing you can do this with Coinbase as well.
@_date: 2017-02-28 20:55:28
Ok, you may be the exception, but most of the commentators in that thread from 5 years ago were extremely skeptical of the price being over $100/Bitcoin by now. $1100+ would seemed super unlikely to most. Also, if they would have bought $5000 worth of Bitcoin back then and held on to it then they would be millionaires by now.      
@_date: 2017-02-28 06:42:11
Just think about how crazy todays prices would have seemed to the people in that thread 5 years ago.
@_date: 2017-02-23 01:44:22
If the COIN ETF is approved, then it probably won't go down lower all year, and now is the best time to buy. If it's denied, then it will probably go down for a short time, but I believe it will eventually recover. If you have anxiety about buying, then I'd suggest you buy a small amount now, and the rest after the news about that ETF comes out. 
If you're willing to hold on to your Bitcoin for the long term, then you shouldn't worry about trying to time the market and just buy a little bit every week. 
@_date: 2017-03-03 04:59:26
Probably just bears who don't have the balls to hold until the SEC makes a decision.

A Ponzi scheme needs a central organization that takes control of the investments. It is likely to collapse if too many investors try to cash out at the same time. Bitcoin is different for a few reasons. First of all, it's not purely an investment. In other words, Bitcoin has usefulness outside of just being an avenue for investing. It can be used as cash, your own personal bank, and/or transferring money anywhere in the world. 
It's also decentralized. When you buy Bitcoin, you are not sending your money to anyone. You control your own investment %100. This also means that it is impossible to collapse. Sure, if everyone tried to sell their Bitcoin for fiat at the same  time then the price would crash. However, you would still own your Bitcoin, and nobody could take it away from you unless they hacked you or stole your keys somehow.  There would be plenty of opportunity for the value of your Bitcoin to recover (which we have already seen many times since previous Bitcoin crashes.) As Bitcoin acquires more users, it becomes more stable and less likely to crash or spike suddenly.

Hodling and buying the dip. I wouldn't mind a dip back down to 750 actually, because I could load up my wallet. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 01:54:13
This is why you shouldn't keep your coins on an exchange.

Email wall.... You can just put in a fake email to read it.
@_date: 2017-03-03 03:05:58
How are you going to know it's a bubble though? Right now, for example, will most likely be considered a bubble If the COIN ETF is denied....

You can't always get cell phone service in middle of nowhere, America though. 
@_date: 2017-03-01 13:47:35


That's not going to happen if the COIN ETF is approved (which seems to be pretty likely at this point.) If not, however, I think a drop of 10-20% (at least) is to be expected. Either way, we'll know in 10 days or less, so now is the time to place your bet.

Glad I'm not the only one. WTF is that supposed to mean? Has anyone really been so far even as decided to use even go want to do look more like?
@_date: 2017-03-12 02:46:19
Cash is the medium of money. The main function of money is to store value. It's not mutually exclusive. Cash would be useless if it couldn't store value.

In a fireproof safe. I have backups at my dad's house. I'd be constantly concerned about it if I buried it.
@_date: 2017-03-02 18:42:19
A denial would make all the ETF speculators sell as fast as possible though. Which would allow the rest of Bitcoin enthusiasts to scoop up their discarded Bitcoins at a discount. 
@_date: 2017-08-13 07:40:43


People have been stating this since 2009, but that doesn't make it true.
