True, I will be buying when the price crashes below $1000

Wouldn't this cause difficulty to go up and lead to more miners to be added?

It's easier to roll out innovations in coins with smaller volumes.   Good for them - I want altcoins to test the latest innovations.  However, not everyone trusts the latest tech with their 1000 BTC transaction.
 
Correct me if I'm wrong, but it was the Bitcoin community that invented Segwit and LN, even if other coins managed to roll it out first.

It's not a scam.   I'm a real person with a solid public reputation.
You can visit me in person at the [Atlanta Bitcoin Embassy.](
I have [dozens of positive customer reviews on social media and reddit.](  I provide all customers with a signed legal contract.    
I have a public reputation and work as a [director for a public foundation](
I'm also a [managing partner in a hedge fund]( and would suffer serious consequences if I engaged in any kind of deceit.

First, the U.S government passes many laws contrary to the Constitution.
Second, the Secret Service enforces laws against counterfeiting.  The claim, in this case was the "Liberty Dollar" is too similar to the U.S. dollar. 
I'm not aware of any laws against creating currency which are not "dollars"

Highly misleading. 
Sites that perform e-commerce need to track the state of the user. They also need analytics to understand customer behavior.
Static websites that host a download or a client-side wallet don't need to use cookies to operate.
More cookies doesn't mean less privacy. It could be a different software architecture.
Yes, crypto e-commerce sites that are legally obligated to do KYC know more about you.  That should be a much bigger concern for you than the number of (easily blockable) cookies they set.

It's possible to send email from any address.  However, this email  also has a valid "paypal.com" digital signature, which I cannot explain.

The purpose of the U.S. Constitution is to place limits on the powers of government, not the people.
See the 10th amendment:

It was overwhelming in December, with hundreds of inquiries per day.  With the markets crashing, most people prefer to keep their Bitcoin wallets in limbo.  I expect it to pick up again with the price.

You can come inside and do it.  The embassy supports all cryptocurrencies, and we're looking for partners to provide educational services to the community.

There is no domain verification process for sender address in the SMTP protocol. There are separate, optional Sender DKIM and SPF protocols which some providers use.

The from address is easy to spoof, but how did they spoof the sender ID?

No links.  It had the name and email used on my PayPal account.  
Did not ask me for anything other than what you see in the screenshot.
I can only speculate about the point of it, but I'm guessing someone wanted to crash the price of Bitcoin.  
I'm not the only one getting email: 
I called PayPal to confirm that (1) the email is fake and (2) my account is fine.

I should have been more clear here.  
I am referring to scaling proposals which do not involve more blocks - either larger blocks or off-chain networks like Lightning.  
These allow more transactions without more blocks.

During a recession,  people will be scrambling to get money to keep their businesses, homes, and cars afloat.  Because crypto markets are still a tiny share of the total economy, they will be quickly drained of most of their value.   Only a minority of the value of Bitcoin is regularly traded, so it would not take much to crash the price to a fraction of its value
