He didn't dispute the logs authenticity in his defense, so we have assume they are legit.

It's "your" coins...just like the voicemails in T-Mobile's servers are "my" voicemails, stocks at Merrill Lynch are "my" stocks, money in Bank of America is "my" money.  It's no different.

Shorting is no joke.  In the early 1990's, Duke and Duke lost over 450 million dollars in one day of trading by shorting frozen concentrated Orange Juice futures.  They had a seat on the Philadelphia Exchange for 150 years, now bankrupt and destitute.

My voicemails are safe with T-Mobile.
My emails are safe with MSFT cloud.
My FIAT is safe at Bank of America.
My coins are safe at coinbase.  
I know, the sky is falling

True, they did sell prior to the trial, but Ross agreed.  The case did not hinge on this decision.  Regardless of Ross's cooperation with these coins, he would have been found guilty.

These markets all use a feedback mechanism, so we know this hasn't happened yet or we've seen comments from victims.
