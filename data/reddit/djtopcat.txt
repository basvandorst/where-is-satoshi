I for one would enjoy watching McAfee dining on his own tiny dick. Start a good recipe thread. 
@_date: 2018-01-30 18:46:42
May not be able to be counterfeited easily, but it can be hacked. cough cough NORTH KOREA! ;)
@_date: 2018-01-26 21:26:54
I'm sorry but nothing in this world is free. There is always a catch. How are they going to make money with no fees?
@_date: 2018-01-23 04:03:09
Fake news. smh
@_date: 2018-01-18 22:56:20
All for nothing of course. Government doesn't give a shit about petitions. 
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:42:04
Does it send out live alerts when North Korea hacks and steals another 500 million in BTC? lol
@_date: 2018-01-19 09:21:32
What a pear shaped loser.
@_date: 2018-01-17 07:20:18
Bitcoin to the moon? lol
More like to the Pit of Misery..Dilly! Dilly!
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:08:17
yes. .0000010 cents
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:07:13
Buttcoin, you heard it here first. 
@_date: 2018-01-17 08:10:58
I'm sure there's plenty of homeless encampments in your city for you to someday sit around a garbage can fire with your pork n beans and talk about the "the good ol' days when Bitcoin should have gone to the moon" Lol
@_date: 2018-01-29 16:35:32
Now I'm craving a Whopper with cheese...
@_date: 2018-01-18 06:13:19
Cool, then you can have some "accidental" fires on those properties to collect the insurance when shitcoin and your other investments go in the toilet. The stock market will be taking a tumble soon too. ;)

Belarus is a shithole country. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 07:50:14

Because BCH would go in the toilet if general people knew the truth. 
@_date: 2018-08-21 04:06:59
Ver can help dine on JM's dick soon...
@_date: 2019-03-27 21:43:24
All fun until the IRS comes knocking lol
@_date: 2019-11-22 07:56:57
Look I want to see McAfee eat his own dick on live feed too, but you must HODL no matter what dark days are ahead!
@_date: 2018-06-29 21:52:56
Will be an even bigger buy when it hits zero soon.
@_date: 2018-06-01 19:42:31
Who the fuck would want to do any banking in a shithole like Pakistan? lol
@_date: 2018-06-12 00:02:56
I don't mind losing some just to witness John McAfee eat his own dick live with Tabasco sauce. 
@_date: 2018-06-11 23:57:04
THE ROOOOOOOOOPE!!
@_date: 2018-06-25 06:23:06
But will John McAfee fulfill his destiny and eat his own dick in a nice balsamic reduction with some fava beans?
@_date: 2018-06-05 02:17:59
Says the guy that went all in on the currency lol
@_date: 2018-06-13 01:23:10
What a coincidence, also accepted at the van down by the river.

@_date: 2017-11-29 03:23:56
cough cough PONZI SCHEME! ;)
@_date: 2017-11-29 03:33:39
People won't be smiling when the feds take notice and step in to regulate. Like any Ponzi scheme the people at the bottom will be screwed the most. The collapse cometh! ;)

We don't live in a democracy period! The United States is a constitutional republic.

Ah the pitfalls of Socialism.
@_date: 2019-04-14 18:33:50
You mean like Maduro? Castro? Pol Pot? Mao? lol
@_date: 2019-04-14 16:12:12
A necessary evil to prevent a financial catastrophe that would have affected more than just the US. I personally would have let them all fail for being stupid and greedy.
@_date: 2019-04-02 23:52:13
It's going to go back down, April Fools news is partly to blame I think.

Speaking of Silk Road, how much time does Ullbricht have left in the pen? Isn't he owed some Bitcoin too?
@_date: 2018-11-03 06:45:59
She's a big girl. Wide hips
@_date: 2018-11-18 06:43:48
They'll make nice toilet reading.
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:14:10
The hooker on the corner Cookie Lee says she'll take Bitcoin payment for ass. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:03:34
Were they hot though?
@_date: 2018-03-16 16:48:42
Dafuq is FUD Snowflake? Can you even read? The cost of mining is becoming unprofitable. Just wait until the taxman comes around ;)
@_date: 2018-03-28 17:05:15
It's not going up buddy, it's slowly going down. 
@_date: 2018-03-09 19:19:05
Unregulated, uninsured cryptocurrency investing= S.0.L.....
Just pretend you lost it at an Indian casino, not much difference. 
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:00:37
It happened, they have the emails and chat conversations. 
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:17:14
You lost me at France lol 
Cheese eating surrender monkeys....
@_date: 2018-03-26 18:19:37
Move the decimal five places to the left and he's spot on. 
@_date: 2018-03-29 21:10:40
Start sending him dick recipes..
@_date: 2018-11-14 03:03:03
Fuck him, should of been on Death Row, or hard labor in a Texas or Louisiana prison.  
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:27:00
The US govt can do whatever the hell it wants. That's the Catch 22 of having unregulated assets. They snatched up SR Ross Albrucht's huge BC stash like candy from a baby. lol
@_date: 2018-02-22 19:38:04
Trust me all the banks are doing now is lobbying the govt to regulate and tax the shit out of crypto investors and companies so they can steal blockchain for themselves. Bookmark this post, it's just a matter of time.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:30:51
The've already sold duh.
@_date: 2018-02-04 08:06:23
Lol The big dogs are just toying with us small time suckers, manipulating the prices to keep it from free falling. Then just when you think it's stable and safe again they're going to pull the chair out again. SODL!
@_date: 2018-03-19 18:14:59
He's going to use Ross Ulbricht's stash along with other  seized BC assets to build the wall. GENIUS!
@_date: 2018-03-30 23:20:08
I'm afraid there is no pot of gold at the end of the rainbow folks. Blockchain technology will continue, but the Bitcoin &amp; crypto party is almost over, it's just swirling in the bowl waiting for the final flush. 
@_date: 2018-02-14 20:03:02
In the end Ver and McAffee will both be eating their own dicks live. 
@_date: 2018-03-27 04:13:48
Fuck that guy, but please thank him for allowing us to buy dirt cheap government surplus BC seized from his laptop at auction :P
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:37:35
Even with the losses, I will get some satisfaction knowing John McAfee promised to eat his own dick on live tv. Time to start Tweeting him proper wine pairings for his upcoming meal. 
@_date: 2018-02-25 22:20:12
You're s.o.l pal. it was probably mtgox, and they went down the toilet along with all their customer's wallets.
It is what it is.

Washington State is not the place to mine. The cheap energy thing is only a myth.

Hopefully some good homeless shelters, or a comfy car for you to sleep in soon Nostradamus.
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:35:17
45 in dog years? so 16?
@_date: 2018-02-21 21:32:55
Dafuq is Samourai? Shouldn't it be Samurai? Maybe they should re-name Spamurai lol
@_date: 2018-02-05 18:37:49
Is that the name of your homeless shelter charity in your town? Lol
It was all a Ponzi scheme to begin with. The government and banks always win in the end. The game will remain rigged and there's nothing you or anyone else can do about it. ¯\_(ツ)_/¯
@_date: 2018-02-01 07:06:02
Um.. Twitter is dying, hardly an endorsement.
@_date: 2018-02-21 22:51:04
inside joke, there was a fake 16 yr old dev pawning off their crypto phone app, and Toyotas then and now are incredibly reliable and get great gas mileage. 
@_date: 2018-04-05 23:09:42
The Indian government is about the last one on Earth to take any fruitless online petitions seriously. lol

Too bad they do not have credit unions in India. Something like the co-op ones here in the US. Yes, they are still banks but they are people driven not like Chase, Wells Fargo, BOA etc.

He can pay to solve any issue. He makes Bill Gates look like a pauper now...

He did in 1997 during the Tom Yum Goong crisis. He's a scumbag!

Paypal fucked themselves with supporting the deceptive Bill Me Later credit scam. Ebay tossed them in the dumpster after that.

FDIC insurance dummy! All banks are perfectly safe in the US, even if there's a big stock market crash and the economy tanks.
