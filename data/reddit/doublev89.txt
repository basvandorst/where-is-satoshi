That also happens in Portugal. [They]( charged me 6€/month because I had less than 3k€ on my account.

Hi OP, can you do a BTC/EUR version of

Wow man, easy. I'm just an European who knows that most Americans believe on what they are told to believe instead of using their brains. In France Marine Le Pen (aka French Trump) almost won the elections by ordering terrorist attacks 2 days before the elections.
I'm just surprised that any clown can be president in the US. I'm not a Hillary supporter but at least she pauses and think a little bit before opening her mouth...

Bitstamp supports SEPA transfers.

Trump supporters put food on these guys dinner tables all the time...

And that's how Trump manage to win the presidential elections...

I had a stop order that didn't execute and had to sell manually for a lower price.
After that Bitstamp platform went down and by the time it was back it was too high to buy again.
Lost too much but Bitstamp got its trade fee!
I'm not happy at all with this...

What's the difference of using a credit card and going to the bank for a loan? A tip: For one of the options you have to tell them why you need a loan. Thank me later ;)

Did not know that. Thanks!

Brainless people are panic selling.
Chinese take their government dictatorship too serious and don't realize that Crypto can't be controlled like everything else. They are not used to be in control, so they let the "ban" news to control them.
We don't need them on this boat. Leave and never come back!

Why promoting bcash? Bitcoin Core is the real bitcoin!

If it was a single buy, it would probably be the WallStreet guys to control the price later on for the futures contracts...

30€ in fees it's ridiculous! I work for a UK company but I'm working remotely from Portugal. I had to order a Revolut card to avoid paying huge fees to my bank. I dream about the day when bitcoin is accepted everywhere...

It's easy to say "I told you so" if things really turn out the way some guys expected.
Let me warn everybody that everyone's going to die someday in the future. Thank me later!

That I know but isn't a very responsible decision. I get thousands of calls from banks asking me if I want a credit card. My answer is always the same: "Why should I spend the money I don't have?"
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:59:58
So, I work to earn money. That money goes to my bank account. To own a credit card, I have to pay some fees fot it to the bank. And in the end I'm not allowed to use my money to buy what I want  because they said so? I'm so proud of us all accepting stupid rules created to steal our freedom...

It's funny because it's true! I was expecting "ASSBANK" to be something interesting IYKWIM
@_date: 2018-02-05 23:20:09
No sh** but still, you earn money to pay for the credit card loan.
