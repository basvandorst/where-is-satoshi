I agree with you. Im talking about economists i see on tv/radio

Edit: With this said, I wanted to say that I own little to no gold but do own quite a bit of bitcoin... go figure :)
  Crypto-currencies have been confiscated already once before.
  Gold bugs don't like bitcoin because theres no value in and of itself. Gold has industrial uses, someone will always want it, bitcoin can lose value overnight and no one will want it for itself.

I buy and sell on ebay and I make sure to print PDF of every completed transaction from paypal for tax purposes and fraud purposes. Highly recommend this.

not the original commenter, but I think people would be afraid to trade hard assets for another fiat-type currency
@_date: 2014-01-27 07:28:08
no one is denying there will be no inflation. They deny there is no inflation "right now"

Make sure to test the cable connecting it, ours was defective but we replaced the cable (made in china) with another and it worked fine!
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:50:49
Good idea!
@_date: 2013-10-22 17:09:13
Ah I see
@_date: 2013-09-12 16:18:52
Yea... terrible idea
@_date: 2013-08-30 23:54:55
That would be nice!

You can buy a baby blacklight for 99 cent at your local 'party store' and carry that on your keychain for a cheap alternative!

Do you convert your Fiat Money (USD or whatever you use) every-time it goes up or down?
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:17:40
Ok I'll try downloading it and messing around with it, thanks!

(Off-topic) I got blockchain app but the balance is different than my wallet? The transaction amounts seem to be the same but the number of transactions is different? not sure why

So what program does someone need to scan the QR code and how does it work after they scan the code? Sorry - I've never used a QR code and don't know how it works
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:41:37
Know any vendors that do this? I started looking for some buttons but only found a couple so far with just a logo. I ordered my plastic card already
@_date: 2013-09-18 15:04:52
Haha made me chuckle. Good way to start the day
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:48:57
Yea - I need to find someone who can make me a pin to wear with a QR code on it!

To get wide market acceptance we need more than just investors though... Maybe as it catches on this will be big

Our Miner had a faulty cable shipped, we swapped the cable and everything worked fine.
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:00:38
I think I will need to get a pin since I am required to wear a uniform - I shall welcome the onslaught of curious peoples in the name of bitcoin!
@_date: 2013-10-01 21:53:09
Blacklight or put the bill up to a lightsource to look for the magnetic strip.
  Carry a pen that tests for fakes!
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:50:33
Oh ok - I wasn't aware I could do that - Thanks!

TL:DR, ELI5 version?

The government should have it's own subreddit to communicate to the masses.
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:51:01
oooo I like!
@_date: 2013-08-28 16:40:59
can someone give me a ELI5 version of what happened? 
@_date: 2013-08-30 16:55:43
That is awesome! I can't wait for the day I receive one of these hah
@_date: 2013-08-30 19:07:39
Too poor to donate at the moment. I honestly wouldn't buy more than one or two pins unless I lost some. Payment would be determined by the going market rate, currently I see pins for 7$-10$. Im willing to talk to coworkers about this if they ask why Im wearing the pin but not actively go pushing it onto others...with that said this sounds like a good kick starter campaign! 
@_date: 2013-08-30 15:55:37
I found this:  Pretty neat!
@_date: 2013-09-02 22:21:47
Thanks brother! Perfect!
@_date: 2013-08-30 23:55:07
Thanks!
