Which one of Taleb's theories are you referring to? And how?

Wow, this is a really neat service. I'm impressed. Glad someone thought to jump on this.
@_date: 2014-03-20 00:09:02
Fact: I read what you wrote.

Well that's a pleasant way to spread a little joy.

Did you really think bitcoin was going to escape taxation across the board? What's so magical about it that makes it so a government wouldn't - or shouldn't - tax it?

And why is this particularly informative? Catastrophic events are generally regarded as such because "no one saw it coming." This piece of "evidence" without anything else is meaningless.

When you buy gold and exchange it on the open market you are taxed, yet it is never converted to USD. So, yeah, I have thought about it. This is basic, common taxation.

Biggest red flag about this article is the phrase "Some experts". And, yes, the safer bet is betting on the protocol rather than a specific manifestation of it (e.g., Bitcoin).

All resources are available somewhere,  if you can accept things on both a very long time scale and universal level. The point being, if we can ever mine asteroids or otherwise pull resources from the vastness which is outer space, even gold could become trivial. 
This is not an exhortation of Bitcoin over gold. Just a sci-fi riff.

Maybe so, I honestly don't know. But just because - hey it sorta happened before and it worked out doesn't mean you should feel safe. That's my point.

The default method is FIFO: first in first out. Just keep track of your BTC in a spreadsheet, and as you spend it allocate to those coins. I don't think it's that far behind the times. see:

Bullshit. How the fuck do people come up with this horseshit?
@_date: 2014-03-27 17:37:32
Yes. You're the one putting forth a theory of how the price will operate. It is not on me to justify myself, but you. And, yes, this smells like absolute horseshit.
@_date: 2014-03-16 22:16:20
This is fine, as long you are equally cognizant of the opposite happening: a total crash (in terms of value) of Bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-03-30 23:22:06
Remember the default is FIFO (First in First Out). Under that scheme it is easier for tax purposes. But I echo your call for a wallet that keeps track of the basis for your BTC.

thinking about? or thinking about how you can't do it? unless you place the order through my account i don't see how i can order a kindle item.

It is not conflicting. Fincen is aiming at preventing money laundering; while the IRS in properly assessing the value and character of your asset. Fincen is worries that you can take dirty money, convert to BTC, and cash out - or some variant of that. People around here need to stop being so naive.

I have no theory.

Don't get too attached to disregarding banking laws. I believe that as Bitcoin becomes more popular, more laws will sprout up around it. For the moment, many countries have taken a wait-and-see approach before stepping in.
