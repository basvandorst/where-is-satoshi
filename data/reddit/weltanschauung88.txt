Nice way to discharge your employment rights under the law, nice way for your employer to get a huge fine if they use this to avoid taxes if even one disgruntled employee complains and a nice way for everyone in a small company get fired as a result.

According to Canadian law (federal and in all provinces), wages must be paid in Canadian currency. If you are paying wages in Bitcoin, filing for tax for wage payments in Bitcoin is illegal and bad business practice since an employee can claim that they were never paid at all even if you've filed your taxes. (Say you pay them in Bitcoin but you state on the tax return the Canadian currency equivalent value) Since this is the case, the rational business practice of any individual would be to not file at all, the most common businesses that don't file taxes are those who hire people off the books, small businesses such as restaurants and others where the staff is easily replaced if complaining about wages, hours, etc. If this happens, you have no recourse to the law, since you were working illegally and your employer has hired you illegally, so you are both engaged in illegal activity and any contract between you (oral or otherwise) is void for illegality.
Now, as per that article, some people are voluntarily accepting Bitcoin as payment, however, since this is not a recognized form of wage, you are basically entering into an arrangement where you can be underpaid without reference to the minimum wage. This can be due to non-recognition of the currency, where you again end up in a quasi-legal situation of receiving something other than money for work (like being paid in sandwiches for working at subway, clearly a strange arrangement), and both you and your employer can be exposed to liability as a result of such an arrangement. However, there are also external factors, imagine a scenario where the value of Bitcoin falls very sharply against CAD, and you have signed a contract to work for, say, 2 Bitcoins per week. You've struck a bad bargain, that's for sure, but since Canadian currency is the benchmark for minimum wage, you're being underpaid considerably. Whether or not you have recourse to the employment law in such a scenario is questionable and therefore the contract is risky, but either way you may not want to be held to a contract that, depending on the value of Bitcoin, forces you to work for x years for next to nothing. You lose your employment rights purely by being outside of the purview of the law.
EDIT: There may be equitable remedies available for cases such as the above, but my point was employment law, purely, not unjust enrichment or other legal doctrines.

You can't force an employee to accept their wages in barter, that's a contract separate from the employment law. Contracting for barter is a good way to discharge your employment rights. I discussed contracting in the last paragraph before the edit, if you contract for wages paid in barter you only have recourse to the law of contract, not employment.

I never claimed to have worked in payroll, I don't see what relevance my work has to what is essentially a legal question.

I did read the article, and the part above is ambiguous. However, if the case is the alternative, that basically employees can chose, after they are paid, to automatically have a portion of their wages converted into Bitcoins as a previous agreement, this is no-different to buying Bitcoins. Maybe there will be future issues based on GST for this, but I agree what I said doesn't apply to this scenario. Notwithstanding the above, what is said was a consequential, or logical, extension of the facts, where the contract was negotiated in such a way that this requirement is stipulated whether by preference of the employer or the employee, issues will arise. (Even if it is post-payment automatic conversion, if you are given no say over it, a court will consider it a composite transaction.)

See my post in response to the other comment above, I deal with employment law on a daily basis, and what you say isn't irrelevant. Just because someone agrees to be paid in, say, wheat based on the wheat market value equivalent to minimum wage doesn't mean such an arrangement is legal based purely on the procedures followed.

That's because nobody gives a rats ass about Bitcoin. Scale it to the same level as developed central banks and then gauge the chaos.

This has nothing to do with Bitcoin, and abolishing a banknote isn't much to panic about. Canada recently abolished the penny, you know, the principle is the same, this one just has a higher face value. (Although, materially, the Canadian penny was worth more! Sweet, sweet, copper.)

Don't forget that Bitcoin is divisible, and although one Bitcoin may cost $235, you could buy 0.1 at $23.50 or 0.01 at $2.35 and so on. There are definitely people willing to buy at the current price, this fact is reflected in the price in itself. As to your question on how many people will cash out, I have no idea.

Maybe they don't view it as an existential threat... That seems like a warrantless assumption requiring proof.

Increase in size generally means decrease in quality on reddit. Although you have more intelligent contributors numerically, those contributors get harder and harder to hear through the noise. I don't think you should limit the types of posts people can submit, but people should read more [r/Bitcoin/new/]( and upvote the meaningful posts that contribute to a productive discussion. It isn't bad to have a picture or a funny meme every now and then, but they should not take over the place.

Stop treating bitcoin like an investment you lost on, buy a portion of one if you want to, or don't, but remember that bitcoins are useful no matter their value. 
@_date: 2013-04-10 14:16:54
The banks, if they are doing anything bitcoin related at all, are probably experimenting with it for speculative purposes. They have nothing to gain (currently) in wasting (potentially) billions of dollars on killing a currency that a) they likely don't know about, or b) they don't consider a threat. Who knows, maybe some banks end up liking bitcoin. Also, I don't now what you mean by "deleting them", buying them up and storing them in irretrievable wallets? Sounds like a waste of money to me.

I don't really see any questions asked answered... Why does everyone so far treat this as some kind of conspiracy? There could be reasons other than the destruction of Bitcoin that governments may want to buy it up for, perhaps they see something of value in them, or perhaps they're curious about them. Also, why the assumption that it is the US Government which is primarily concerned with this? It could be any government.

You're not morally obliged to do anything. If you don't want to stay, go, if you don't want to go, stay. I'll be staying, but that's my personal choice.

Thanks, this is what I was looking for. I find it likely that they may purchase small amounts to see how it works, but would be careful not to prop up the price/general acceptance even though they could collect taxes by other means (like property tax, natural resources) why lose one stream of revenue for other, perhaps precarious, streams? And considering how worried the USA tends to get when other countries suggest that say, the Euro, ought to be used for petroleum trading, I can only imagine how worried they'll get when Bitcoin gets big.
I guess it isn't an existential threat yet, but that could change at anytime in the future.
