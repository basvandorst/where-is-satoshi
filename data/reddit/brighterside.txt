Thanks - it was in regard to addressing the anoniminity concerns; question about a special blockchain that supports account ownership and validation, etc, etc. 
Also, a question about transaction validation in the event coins are stolen- somehow forcing a 2Factor input for 'marked' tokens that require said input, preventing unauthorized transactions. 
Just a few ideas to increase the security and credibility into the currency...

Of course Dorian Nakamoto is not freaking Satoshi Nakamoto. People are so gullible to think a man who wants to preserve his anonymity would actually put his *real* name on a proposal for the entire project?
@_date: 2014-03-07 07:02:10
ah. well your title seems to point fingers. I suppose I misinterpreted.
@_date: 2014-03-09 04:01:18
I assumed lack of adoption is a limiter toward widespread utilization among businesses.
@_date: 2014-03-09 06:09:22
Why do you suppose this is?
@_date: 2014-03-15 01:35:49
Say I steal your private key - that's it. You've lost all your money.
I'm suggesting there needs to be a secondary authentication mechanism rather than just the reliance on private key obscurity.

Why can't he sue? There was blatant negligence here given the sensitivity of the story full well knowing the implications of life endangerment, etc.

I understand it perfectly. You do not: **'Wiki Bitcoin'**
**A private key** in the context of Bitcoin **is a secret number that allows bitcoins to be spent.** Every Bitcoin address has a matching private key, which is saved in the wallet file of the person who owns the balance. The private key is mathematically related to the Bitcoin address, and is designed so that the Bitcoin address can be calculated from the private key, but importantly, the same cannot be done in reverse.
**Because the private key is the "ticket" that allows someone to spend bitcoins,** it is important that these are kept secure. Private keys can be kept on computer files, but they are also short enough that they can be printed on paper. An example of a utility that allows extraction of private keys from your wallet file for printing purposes is pywallet.
Again, if I steal your private key ALL YOUR MONEY IS GONE. What are you not getting about that? Why wouldn't you want to double up security when using your private key? Do you know how many people have had their bitcoin stolen because of their private key being compromised?
@_date: 2014-03-16 05:14:46
Don't know why people down-voted you. This is a valid point. If your Android OS is infected, it could potentially be compromised.
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:32:38
You're not supposed to keep a wallet in public with paper notes.
Your credit card funds can be refunded and the bank will reimburse you and reissue a new credit card.
Steal my banking login and I contact the central authority (the bank) and notify them of pending fraud for which they will reset my credentials.
Steal my computer, so what. If you have the private key you still don't have a 2nd method of authentication; I'm suggesting things such as a code that's texted to your cell phone for which you can then use in a transaction (ie 2FA).
The risks are not the same.

Thanks t9b, I'm going to eventually read up a bit more on it and get in touch with some of the developers.
@_date: 2014-03-09 08:43:35
'Brilliant inventor' is a matter of perspective. Some crazies would try to blame the creator for inherent security gaps present as part of the Bitcoin management process. The Mt. Gox example comes to mind for someone hellbent on revenge looking to target *someone* for their loss.
The prosecution's best argument would be negligence in the sense of associating someone off limited evidence (name) to be the creator of something in light of events that could very well put the alleged person's life and or integrity at risk, *Posting their address and other personal info in images* to the public (which is the huge one here.), and further, harassment/stalking/privacy invasion, despite Mr. Nakamoto's repeated attempts to remove the reporter from his property!

Thanks, I've been very interested in bitcoin from an info security perspective. Never actually owned it. Would like to try out a penny wise to see how easy it is, etc. Probably try experimentation, etc.
@_date: 2014-03-07 10:17:34
Can I have a penny in bitcoin?
@_date: 2014-03-18 22:34:17
**Bitcoin is not going to be adopted here (USA) on wide scales such as that in foreign countries.**
The currency is simply not safe. No one will risk losing money - it's akin to walking around with a hole in your back pocket where you keep your wallet - but if you walk jjusttt right it won't fall out - utter ridiculousness. I have several ideas to increase the security of transactions, but the community has shot me down without serious thought into my suggestions. A community that fails to acknowledge the security gaps in the Bitcoin protocol will continue suffering the fate that has rendered so many Bitcoin adopters currency-less.
@_date: 2014-03-07 23:42:09
Woah! How do I claim this? Thank you for the penny dear sir!
@_date: 2014-03-07 06:56:17
Sorry man, this is just common sense. If you give cash to your bank and ask them to transfer said funds to anonymous account holder A, you have the right to cancel said transaction. Even if it shows up that the funds are in process of being received on your end! You're blaming bank of america, when you should be either blaming all major banks that do this, or yourself.
@_date: 2014-04-11 19:20:09
Bitcoin will fail because the developers will not implement better security mechanisms that would allow widespread use of the currency.
You know how many people have had their coins stolen? It's akin to people walking around with their wallets holding them with hands slathered in butter. One wrong step and you'll drop your wallet, and all your money with it.
@_date: 2014-03-21 12:09:50
You're missing the point.
"Decrypting and encrypting the wallet.dat every time you start or quit the Bitcoin client can be tedious (and outright error-prone). If you want to keep your wallet encrypted (except while you're actually running the Bitcoin client), it's better to relegate the automation to a small shell script that handles the en/decryption and starting up Bitcoin client for you (Linux and OSX)."
If I told you that people can get into a special plane for a really cheap but the only caveat is that the plane has a higher likelihood to go down because the pilots tend to make mistakes, or are lazy, would you get on that plane? Fuck no. The fact that 2FA has to be done by third party uses, or it must be done by reliance on the user is retarded. Some people are lazy, others might make a mistake - no one is going to risk wide adoption of a currency in which a *tiny* mistake or sheer laziness would result in loss of all your money.
I'm proposing that the core code be changed to inherently use 2FA; cell phone text code confirmations, etc prior to transactions. Without a viable 2nd layer of INHERENT security, Bitcoin is destined to fail.
@_date: 2014-03-15 00:41:24
Thanks, I'll give it a shot.
@_date: 2014-03-09 01:51:04
No bit :(

“If you have the local scrip, like US dollars, and you want to convert it to Bitcoin,” explained Georgetown University associate finance professor James Angel, the ATM will “take your money and spit out a Bitcoin number for you.”
Sigh. You people are now falling into the trap of giving your cash to these 'ATMs' for private key info. Bitcoin is too young to be presented in this fashion. The core code needs to change to address MASSIVE security concerns with regard to the currency.
@_date: 2014-03-19 01:16:53
I have on several occasions inquired about changes to the core code. The developers are too afraid to make core changes to Bitcoin functionality - they believe it is right where it should be. Because of the high number of Bitcoin adopters, they believe the core code should not change - this is a flawed way of thinking. Why so many people have adopted such a vulnerable currency is beyond me; in despite of the fact that so many have lost money due to security vulnerabilities present in the protocol *and continue to lose money*, mind you. This is akin to people continuing to fly a specific model commercial aircraft despite the fact that it has crashed over 5 times in the past few years. 'But hey, they continue to send these things up in the air right? As long as I wasn't on that specific plane I'll continue to fly!' is the mentality the community shares. The destructiveness of this thinking is incredible - though I will not delve into that now.
I believe as Benjamin Graham did from perspectives of speculation, that because of the nature of Bitcoin value volatility - adopters of Bitcoin are considering themselves 'investors' in the currency. In reality, there is no investment in this currency, as its very nature entices people to adopt it via *speculation*; that the prices are 'going to the moon' and so on. There are so many flaws in the adoptive mindset for this currency; specifically those supported by the developers. I am sad to say that the consolidation of these pertinent issues within this digital currency will inevitably lead to its failure.
But downvote me because it just proves to me and the rest of the world 2 things:
1) Your ignorance to these facts shows that the adopters of this currency are unwilling to shift their ways of thinking.
2) You're willing to continue getting on that plane.

Ninja, don't do it.
You'll blow it away, it's too late in the game for the kind of return you're looking for.
@_date: 2013-11-14 15:12:24
Have you even done your research?
Bitcoin is controlled by people with deep pockets. The market can fluctuate at their will.
Again, it is too late in the game to invest anything of significance into this currency.
But hey, your money.
