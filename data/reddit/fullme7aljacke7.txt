This is more and more of a trend lately in shopping habits with so many options available. If a place treats someone a certain way, they will tell people. It's that simply.

I have a local bitcoin ATM near me. It actually goes by real-time value but appears to lag behind on updating the value. It has a 6.9% fee though. Only 1.9% higher than the cheapest method I've found.... I will gladly use the ATM considering I get paid in cash frequently, making my bitcoin basically invisible to prying eyes

I had this problem with a Chase credit card, first time the transaction went through just fine and I paid it off like a normal purchase. Second time they denied it. I complained and then finally was told they will approve the transactions but they will be processed as a cash advance. Charging me 5% + interest if not paid off.   
Now there's a bitcoin ATM near me. I use that at a 6.9% fee. Well worth it when you consider the anonymity.

More Bitcoin
@_date: 2019-07-09 02:11:34
I'd still have to get the USD on the echange some how, which is where the fee comes in. Cheapest I found is $25 via my bank or 5% via my credit card company  
Edit: Just found out there's a nearby local bitcoin ATM operated by CoinFlip with a 5% fee, which is the lowest I've found + doesn't require identity verification. Perfect

Can you imagine being alive to witness time travel?  Like full blown people using it similar to what we see in movies.
Like it's so common it's a normal thing to do on the regular for an average person.
Actually we'd probably screw up our own existence with that power. We don't need to figure that out.

I made this mistake and didn't sell at 20k. Originally bought it at around 10k, then more at 7k, more at 3.5k.... been hodling ever since. Now the trick is to figure out what the "peak" will be this time around.... Before it plummets again and I buy more back :)

I have mine scattered. The largest amount in cold storage, I have some in a wallet on my comp and some on an exchange. I only add to the cold storage, never take. That's the hodl stash, the rest is play money.

Thank you!

Thanks for sharing this info, I am still learning and had no idea it was this easy to see if there was anything to claim.   
I didn't have anything, but I did find info to an old wallet I had that still had $20 (today) left on it so that was cool!

The fees are a bitch but, what do you expect? 
I invested $500 back when the value was around 10k. I then invested another $1000 when it was around 13k. I had been thinking about investing since the beginning of the year.... The boat has not been missed, the water is just splashing around a lot more right now. I paid about $100 total in fees between the two transactions. I could have sold my BTC after it climbed to recover my initial investment + fees and still have about $500 worth of BTC remaining, but I decided to wait it out.
I am going through cancer treatment and just found out my $500k procedure won't be covered unless i post pone it 6 months for medicaid to verify I haven't had ANY nicotine or alcohol in 6 months, even though they never told me or my doctors this would be required.... The way I see it, if I end up losing my $1500 in BTC... that's the least of my worries. If I leave it and it ends up being worth a shit ton, I will either pay off my medical bills, or transfer it into my significant other's possession upon cash out.

Hasn't bounced much... I think it'll continue to fall for now tbh. I made a short yesterday sold @ 12 and bought back @ 10.5 but I am buying more whenever I decide the dip has bottomed out lol. Trying to fund my account better for DCA but the search for minimal funding fees continues. So far the 2 credit unions I checked out are $25 to transfer funds to Gemini or $50+ for international to bitstamp. Researching my fees and such now for better solutions because atm taking a 5% hit on a credit card purchase is the way to go
@_date: 2019-07-09 01:51:50
You lose some money in fees getting the money to bitcoin (at least from USD), but why not sacrifice a little to spread awareness? It supports the overall goal. Normalize bitcoin spending.  
Still searching for the least expensive way to turn USD into BTC
@_date: 2017-12-14 03:49:24
Exactly. Money isn't important at this point, being rich or poor is irrelevant when compared to the value of life itself.
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:42:04
I was foolish and purchased my BTC from bitstamp using a credit card for an instant purchase. I would be grateful for advice to minimize fiat to btc fees. I looked at transfers fro my bank to btc and the fees would have been $75 each....

There is financial assistance, but they will only help so much. Like for out of town stays (3 or 4 days at a hotel in between chemo rounds) I'll have to pay $80+ a night and my insurance will compensate me a max of $40 a night, but I won't be reimbursed for as long as up to 4 months, after I already paid for it out of pocket. 
It's bad enough I pretty much got screwed for being a responsible person and having savings set aside. I had about 5k between cash and bank accounts. The temporary disability to compensate for the sudden loss of work will only cover 2 out of the 8 months I've been dealing with this, because I didn't have less than $2000 worth of "assets" for those first 6 months. They are giving me this month and last month because I closed my savings account in early October but they only care about the balance on the 1st of the month.
Sorry I'm ranting...

Most of the time ARs are around $1200 To $1500 from a recognized dealer. I purchased mine from a private seller, who is also a manufacturer, and a friend of mine, so needless to say the price was practically a steal. 
@_date: 2017-12-09 21:30:29
I made this mistake waiting for kraken verification for 6+months... Then said fuck it and bought in $500 worth at $7500/ea. I waited for the dips... could have had half a bc at $5000 but was too scared. I regret things, but thats what pushed my "fuck it, I'm going thru cancer, if I lose my ass on btc it will be irrelevant" mentality. I've got a grand wrapped up in it now and I am still above water. So all in all, if you want it buy it. Don't bitch out lol

I was unaware of this. Thank you for passing on your knowledge in an informative and respectful manner! 
I am a VR game developer so I understand and greatly appreciate good effort from developers. I know there is a vastly sizeable difference between what I do and what they do. I noticed after I became a programmer, because it's both my passion and dream job. I appreciate a lot more things I didn't even think of in the past. I like to disect technology now, what is it, how does it work, etc.
@_date: 2017-12-13 19:18:14
You are absolutely correct. I used to see like $300 as a huge amount to spend in 1 transaction, I just recently bought an AR-15 for $750 and after I counted it I just thought to myself "Wow, this doesn't feel like nearly as much money as it used to"
@_date: 2017-12-13 22:39:25
But then that ruins my excellent credit score of 750, however if I pay them whatever I can afford... like, $20 a month. That shows I am "trying" to pay it off and wont fuck my credit. ;)

Did something similar to this once... I stressed out the whole day wondering what was going to happen..... ended up selling at a high point right before a small dip, bought back in during the dip and gained like 0.002. So not worth the stress I put myself through though. Plus it's lower right now than when I bought said dip xD

Fees vary depending on what you're doing and where you're doing it and how long you want to wait.
Example: Cash app = hidden fees because they always quote you for like $200 less/more than whatever they are saying BTC current price is.
US Bank transfer fees are usually in the $50 range...
Exchanges also have their own fees associated with withdrawals and deposits and even buying and selling, you will have to read each individual places information to decide how you want to handle your crypto.
Bitcoin has its own fees for transactions. These fees go to the miners, it is their reward for processing our transactions. The higher the fee you pay, the faster it gets processed because the miners are all competing for the higher fee transactions.
Bitcoin ATMS all operate differently but as you've seen above there are many ways to charge fees, some are percentage based, some are just current price undercuts, and some are flat rates.

I haven't lost money to them exactly.... But if I would have been granted access to their site in a timely manner lets just say I would have gotten my BTC a lot cheaper than I did after waiting for their verification process.... I started it like 6 months ago and T3 still hasn't gone through.... T1 and  T2 just went through like a month or 2 ago... That right there was more than enough bullshit for me.

I just read that article on bitcoin magazine about surviving the fork and I'm still kind of confused, but if I understand it correctly.... If certain things happen during this fork there could essentially be two types of bitcoins? Could someone summarize what this means exactly? I mean if I have 1 btc when the fork happens and it does end up being both types of btc, would that mean I have 2 btc both worth something different? Sorry for noob question, just trying to make my tiny brain comprehend this...
