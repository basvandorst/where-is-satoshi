I want this to be true. There's a part of me that thinks, during bear markets, people will sell anything and everything. But, we'll have to see what the market says.

The amazing thing about investing is, you're able to achieve above average results by follow the herd.

Maybe, it's wishful thinking of me, but I figure as long as bitcoin can scale reasonably well... it'll be fine. We don't need all the answers right now. As long as we making progress (Segwit, Lightning Network). It'll be like how the Internet, has to constantly scale to meet it's demands. 


I'm glad you mentioned the lack of real anonymity. I figure that's where Monero steps in. Although, there is research into confidential transactions which would improve Bitcoin's privacy. 


Yeah, I suppose people won't really use it as a currency, while the price fluctuates as wildly as it does. 


Haha, didn't say it was just old people, said most... and especially old people. I made this list, because I've been hearing some of my peers (~25) say Bitcoin has no real use case. Which hurt my head. 


Haven't put too much thought into regulation. For the market manipulation point... if bitcoin does get big enough and represents say 500 billion or 1 trillion. It will reduce the effectiveness of those players.

Haha, that's good. Advantages: no fees for merchants. Disadvantages fees for users.

Hmm, atm it does encourage hoarding. Hopefully, if Bitcoin gets enough money pumped in and becomes a lot less volatile. It won't have the 50% jumps up and down in the span of a couple of days. Maybe it'll move that much in a year (or a couple of years). That'll encourage people to spend. 


It really does feel like Bitcoin is emulating gold. It's like a gold rush. First come, first serve. Settling the transactions, exactly like how people used to settle transactions with gold. 


I suppose, that's Bitcoin playing it's role as a currency, it's up to the people to choose what and how to spend it.

Agreed. It's still got a while to go before it's use becomes mainstream, but it's definitely headed in the right direction.

Yeah, it was a funny comment I overheard someone make when they were talking about how Bitcoin isn't real.


Interesting thoughts. Almost like freedom of speech via money.

Yeah, that's a good one. Don't know how big of a problem tainted coins are right now. But they are an unnecessary source of worry for most people.

The funniest thing is, during the whole run up, he did own a small holding. He sold a bit, now I'm not sure what his holdings are. 
He definitely does not understand bitcoin. He's the type who thinks he knows everything. His argument against bitcoin is the coffee example. I don't think he knows about the LN.

I think it's a joke, he's being sarcastic.

Gold mate. Glad someone made this. He has another crash to add to that video.
