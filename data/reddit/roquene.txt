Yea, the timing was absolutly awesome. 2 Days ago i started to make real profit the first time ever. And BAM, all gone. It is really too ridiculous.
@_date: 2016-08-03 08:01:49
Guess they sending it over a bitcoin mixer or similar. of course not all at once. some gets exchanged to altcoins or maybe anonym currencies. there are hundred of thousand ways to let the coins disappear and cash them out.
@_date: 2016-08-05 22:24:21
This raises more questions than it answers.
But thanks for info.
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:50:51
Even with the keys there should be a limit in place. BitGo has extra options for that for exact this case. So either bitfinex not used this or BitGo software failed to enforce it.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:35:23
Disgusting. Try to scam people who already lost a lot.
Hope these bastards burn in hell.
@_date: 2016-08-05 11:28:48
There should be one absolut paradigma in Bitcoin-Business: The User keeps always one key.
2-of-3 multisig. One Key for the Exchange, one as Backup (in Cold) and one for the User.
But the Backup-Key has a waiting period of 24 hours.
So when the User lose his keys, he open a ticket and tell that the Exchange. They can now sign a transaction with the backup-key and it take 24 hours until the transaction is valid and can be broadcasted.
As far as i know there is already something in bitcoin implemented to archive that, no?
even when backup and exchange key get compromissed, it is not possible to move funds out immediately. there is always a 24 hour window to double-check everything.
It's idiotic here to take the user from the responsibility. We are all grown up and can take care of our own stuff.
Give us the key to our money.
To make it short: It should never customer fund moved without its key. Except in special cases, after 24 hours.
If he made a normal withdrawal, this is checked on the side of the Exchange, signed and then sent to the customer. He sign it locally a second time and broadcast it to the network. best in combination with 2FA.
But guess I overlooked some details here...
@_date: 2016-08-07 11:31:22
I agree that it's *for now* the best solution. But this story is far from over. 
One of the two companys (or both) messed up on olympic performance levels.
This must have consequences. First of all, they should still answer a number of questions: 
There are too many things left that do not fit into the picture.
And on smokescreens i react allergic.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:18:30
Okay, i understand your point. I also would prever a 'real' bitcoin debit card or other ways to pay direct with btc. unfortunatly you are right, the possibilites here in germany are way behind some other countrys around. hope that change soon.
@_date: 2016-08-08 20:45:07
Lucky guy. And good behavior of Synapse.
Have something like this already expected.
There is absolut no legal way Bitfinex can just grab fiat-money from a Banking Account or somewhere else. none.
@_date: 2016-08-07 23:09:31
I think 24 hours after enabling of withdraws, this story ends anyway.
most people will try to get their remaining funds out there as fast as possible. The trading breaks completely and Bitfinex has no income through fees anymore.
So the Bitfinex tokens are never paid.
Then they are insolvent and no one ever gets its 36% back again.
yep, i guess that's exactly what is going to happen.
@_date: 2016-08-06 15:56:03
Please also update the statuspage. bc your blog is: "Internal Server Error". guess to much traffic.

Coinbase has it's office in San Francisco as far as i know.
It's now 13:38 there. So still 'early'. 
Chances are good they process your request today (or tomorrow). 
Don't think they just keep your coins. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 10:03:43
That start to look realy shady. 
You are losing credibility very fast right now.
And i hate to be the FUDer but this whole story feels very familiar to me.
"We got hacked".
@_date: 2016-08-09 10:40:54
Not exactly happy to hear that. At least withdraw should be enabled today. Settlement is done, so no reason to delay it.
@_date: 2016-08-02 23:13:57
I'm aware of this. But every corporation should have some secured funds in a unreachable location for situation like this. So guess this is a no.

**36.067% cut**


This looks at first glance like a reasonable solution.
@_date: 2016-08-02 18:59:04
But as far as i see, BitGo is insured. 
don't know if that works in this case.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:32:38
Well i deposited on monday and from my deposit adress the coins where moved to  which seems to be the hotwallet?
And from there it looks like all funds got moved out yesterday. So guess my coins are gone?
i know you have shitload to do, but maybe can you comment on that?
just want to know where i stand.
@_date: 2016-08-05 20:05:34
Already 15:00 EST. Guess that is again a "tomorrow".

Looks like US user of SynapsePayment getting their USD 100% back. 
I am happy for this people. However, that means for all other deeper cuts. no?
Have something already suspected in this direction.
Bitfinex has no legal basis to grab fiat money and use at own will.
Wonder what about countries where Bitcoin are recognized as "cash" (or 'private money').
I feel Bitfinex has made it much worse with this move.
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:33:17
They are not bankrupt. Otherwise we would not see a single satoshi for a very long time.

Hell, i realy hope bitfinex admins set a reasonable transfer limit. 
@_date: 2016-08-06 22:05:01
there are some very good answers out in the wild:
and don't think they hit the market in a couple of years. it was a important step, but there is still a very long way to go.
think more like 15-20 years.
@_date: 2016-08-03 13:12:18
Ah right. Did not thought about the starting 1. Hm okay, i feel a little bit better now, heh. Thanks for the fast answer. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2016-08-03 07:58:41
Even with the keys there is a transfer limit. or at least there **should** be a limit according to BitGo. looks like hacker managed to get around it somehow. which of course is a HUGE problem. not only for bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:58:02
I'm quite sure you don't trade at all.
Exchange a coin with other is not trading.
@_date: 2016-08-02 20:01:02

No Exchange could that
@_date: 2016-08-11 14:27:43

he is like the duracell bunny
@_date: 2016-08-10 12:22:53
Hope you not confuse Value with Price.
The Value should be always $1. (Bitfinex owes $ 1 per token).
The Price on the Market has nothing to do with it.
Even if i buy 1 BFX for 10 Cent, i still get $1 from Bitfinex.
@_date: 2016-08-08 15:38:26
There existed no shares before the hack afaik.
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:48:53
Hell yes, did not thought about the BTCJam / Loanbase / BTCPoP guys until now. that will lead to a lot of defaulting.
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:45:09
The IP Address is a very valid point. the API should be locked to one IP Only: the Bitfinex Server. not to activate this protection is very negligent. And probably legally a disaster if something happens.
@_date: 2016-08-06 11:43:51
Or you just could load one of the thousand available debit card with bitcoin and pay with that. do it all the time.
why go the way from bitcoin to giftcard (which obviously don't work most of the time). just do bitcoin &gt; debit / credit card. works every time.
but in fact you did not paid with bitcoin at all. you paid with a card that you bought with bitcoin.
that's a difference. there are already several shops in germany where you can pay with bitcoin direct.
@_date: 2016-08-02 19:45:28
Wondering the same.
@_date: 2016-08-03 12:52:50
I don't know how this all works internaly, but i can't freakin image that it is not possible to hold biggest part of the coins secure. and i mean _offline_ with a airgap. not like "it can't be stolen because there is a limit". it should be "it can't be stolen, there are 5 meter steel and a hellhound".
@_date: 2016-08-12 13:42:46
Hm, that's sad. The posted alternatives are 'okay', but missing one feature: Price showing in the tab all the time.
Just found  who does exactly that. Excellent :)
@_date: 2016-08-04 12:49:17
Bitfinex customers are not BitGos customers. We are directly customer of BitGo. And Bitfinex is direct customer.
bitfinex just automated the creating of the wallets. but the wallets and all the coins belong without doubt to the customer and not BFX.
@_date: 2016-08-09 18:41:34
You should use the security model of 
One key for the user, one for the exchange. The coins never leave the control of the owner. Like the idea.

@_date: 2016-08-08 19:34:39
Wait 24 hours. The transaction got rejected because your transaction fee was to low. it should reappear in your wallet after a while. or maybe get confirmed from a miner that accept low fees. patience.
@_date: 2016-08-11 20:26:54

@_date: 2016-08-06 00:35:59
I would not say it's not allowed. But it's at least a stupid idea to do so. letting the hacker know that FBI / Interpol/ The Mounties are after him is unlikely to help in this situation.
and even if bitfinex not called the authorities right away, you can be damn sure, they know it meanwhile. 
@_date: 2016-08-03 15:55:40
@_date: 2016-08-08 17:36:46
You think the FBI is telling a random guy if there are investigation going on or not? They are not even allowed to say "maybe". 
This is about protection of investigations and data.
In my country not even get lawyers full access to the files as long as the investigation is ongoing.
I know, not the answer everybody wants to hear.

Well, you can see that Coins moving from Adress A to B. But you don't know to whom these adresses belong. He could for example send some coins to a exchange, sell them, buy litecoin and withdraw them. (or buy bitcoin back and withdraw to new adress). You would have zero chance to follow them because you don't know which of the withdrawals belong to the hacker.
To prevent this, all exchanges need to block the stolen coins. but don't know if that is even possible. 
Or he could just use a Mix-Service (
there are thousand ways to stay anonymous with bitcoin.
I am not an expert, but I suspect it is completely impossible to trace the coins absolutely unequivocally.

You are right. i did not thought about the basic efficiency. so it's possible in theory but not practicaly. so if someone would mine with millions CPU, he would probably never ROI. only thing he could try, is a 51% attack. (if i understand the mechanics correct)
@_date: 2015-05-31 01:54:23
Cascading. Use both services. Transmit directly from one service to another service if possible. Send BTC to Exchange. Sell it and buy back at the same price. You should get other Coins. (Or i'm wrong here?)

Some "ASIC-Proof" altcoins tried to address this problem.

Then you can't install it via package manager, true. So either get the AppImage to work or compile it.
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:38:54
why not just install it with apt-get or the GUI of your package manager?
but if you want to use a AppImage you need to give the file execution permissions with `chmod +x &lt;filename&gt;` or rightclick it and set it there.
@_date: 2016-01-11 01:51:52
Is it not already centralized?
i mean 4 pools holding together over 75% of hashrate.
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:18:04
i'm quite sure you can just install it with the normal package manager
@_date: 2019-03-04 05:44:21
command line tool for package management. 
e.g. `sudo apt-get install electrum` installs electrum
but i think you can now use the shorter command apt. so `sudo apt install electrum`
Not used mint / ubuntu or debian in ages so not sure.
Or as said, just use the normal package manager frontend that comes with Mint.

@_date: 2018-06-12 19:36:40
tbh, i still think the insane pump that started mid 2017 was completely artificial. and it goes back to 'normal' level it had for over 3 years. so in the range 250-500$

Back in the days when Bitcoin was about technological revolution and not the next Airdrop, ICO or lunatics screaming around on stage.
Aaah, how far we have come.
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:46:37
Actually i hate this expression, but Bitcoin is approaching the "too big to fail" point very fast. way to many people and organizations have their hands on this technology. if someone would try to take the immutability away, bitcoin would be instant dead. not saying it's impossible but extreme unlikely. There is too much money in the game.
@_date: 2018-03-21 03:18:27
What's the news? That was known since at least **2013** and absolutely nothing happened.
You think that's the only illegal data on the chain? cmon.
What does it mean for bitcoin? nothing. absolute nothing.
@_date: 2017-09-17 07:07:30
Revolutionary ideas don't drive adoption. Money does.
Without people pumping money into it and trying to 'get rich', bitcoin would still be absolutly unknown and used only by some geeks (including me).
The idea is great, but what exactly you want to do with a coin that has no value and no real world use?
I don't like it either, but we **need** the investments.
If you want a coin only 'controled by mathematics rules', why use bitcoin in the first place? go to some of the lesser known alts with no market cap.
Bitcoin has got a lot of attention. Including the strong finance powers and governments. deal with it.
The idea that bitcoin will generate some kind of secondary economy, decoupled from fiat, died a long time ago, sorry.
@_date: 2015-04-24 01:01:37

why the hell should i care what the government say?
bitcoin is peoples money. nobody has the right (or abillity) to ban it.
it's out of control of the government, and that is a damn good thing.

No offense, but if someone would ask me why "the fuck i'm banned you dictator", he would get another instant kick.
Why so unfriendly?
How about "Hello, have a problem. Looks like
I was falsely banned. could you check?"
@_date: 2015-04-23 04:22:04
and what is the problem? many bitcoin business do that. The need to. Because of the Money Laundering Act. do you have a better idea for secure verification?

Why duckduckgo?
It's running on US Server (Amazon). Under control of the Patriot Act. Neither safe nor anonymous. Collecting data like everyone else. Better use  and force in the settings the use of EU Server and not US.

Your coins are safe. In the case of a hard fork (Which hopefully will not happen) you would have them on both chains. like it happened with ETH/ETC. Only coins mined after that would be on one chain or the other.
Best case is no hard-fork and for you absolutly nothing change.
Prerequisite is, of course, you have control over your own keys.
I do not know how different Exchanges that then handle.
@_date: 2015-11-26 19:01:29
ORWL? O RLY?

You can not lose coins, no matter what happens.
However, depending how the exchanges handle the possible fork, you may not get the coins on the new chain. The coins you have now, are not at risk.
So best is to remove everything from the exchanges and store it local.

The producing is not the expensive or problematic part.
R&amp;D is. you don't pull a high power-efficient ASIC design out your ass in one week. Stuff like this takes years to develop. There is a reason why nobody can compete with Bitmain. 
Their advantage is knowledge and, above all, experience.
Not even INTEL or other big company can just go and say "Hey, lets throw a better ASIC on the market".
This needs time. A LOT of time and a shitload of money to research and develop, with a high chance to fail. If Bitmain bring the next generation of their Antminer on the Market before your Design is production ready, you are doomed and you will lose all your investment.
Risk-Reward Ratio is just not good enough.
And btw, being good in CPU development does not equal being good in ASIC development.
Intel is high specialized in CPU and for example not in GPU. That's why they needed to buy other specialized corporations for that. (Like AMD bought ATI)

Support for cash would indeed very cool. So far only found a german solution for that ( /  You buy something online, get a code to print out, go to a partner-shop (several local supermarkets and gas stations), give them the code and pay in cash. 
seconds later the online seller get the "ok" from the system and his money. In principle, this is a 100% anonymous way and *should* also work with bitsquare imho.

Early october 1923 it was equivalent to roughly 1 US Dollar (2 weeks later only $0.10). i'm not enterily sure how to calculate the todays value from it, but some pages say that 1$ then would be around $15 now (or $1,50 later in october).
so in other words, basically worth nothing.
