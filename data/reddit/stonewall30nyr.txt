And this is why I reject socialist programs as an American. Once implemented it's impossible to remove, people become reliant on the political party that pushes for them, then all of a sudden rights start disappearing, and boom America becomes Venezuela

I mean I like Bitcoin but he's not wrong. They're unregulated, and could very well facilitate illegal activities, could crash or vanish over night (obviously very unlikely) they're also exploitable by the Rich. Whales can actively alter Bitcoin value for their benefit, but also making others lose money
@_date: 2019-07-12 12:44:24
So he's not a fan of currencies that aren't backed by anything. Mind blowing
@_date: 2019-08-20 16:16:05
Private as in the private sector. Usually people refer to govt enteties as public

Not rationalizing it by blaming the victim, saying hey I consider myself a good person but if someone was so uncareful that they accident sent me 40k in btc they'd be beat. Be more careful with that kinda money.
@_date: 2019-08-16 00:02:46
Not your keys, not your coins is not true, heading it on Reddit doesn't make it so, their official policies say otherwise as does numerous articles online. You're the one with zero knowledge echoing incorrect facts you heard on this sub. I didn't spam, I posted 1 referral link to someone who already stated they might use RH. Get over it
@_date: 2019-08-04 15:45:38
Yeah I'm sure you and anyone else downvoting me would really turn over the 40k.
@_date: 2019-08-04 16:02:16
See that's different, if someone that makes 35-40k got that, you could bet they'd disappear real quick like the guy in the original comment
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:05:12
Depends how much you want to invest and how frequently you want to touch it. Do you plan on throwing 20$ here, 4$ there, 15$ there type of thing, or are you looking to drop 30k$ tonight and leave it for a decade?
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:10:16
LMFAO okay
@_date: 2019-08-04 02:42:47
Not gonna lie if someone accidentally sent me 4 btc they'd be beat and I consider myself a good person but hey, gotta be careful when you're messing with that kinda money
@_date: 2019-08-15 17:22:25
Yeah Robinhood is fine for that, if you hit a really high amount like, let's say 10k or more, maybe transfer it over to coinbase or something but the app isn't my favorite and there's fees
@_date: 2019-08-04 20:12:06
If I accidentally sent 4btc to someone I'd know it was my fault and assume I was never seeing it again
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:39:03
You do own it, it's held in a group portfolio, if I went to a stock broker and opened an account and bought 500 shares of Disney, I own those shares even though it's not physically in my hand. It's the same thing but people get hung up on not having the key or being able to use it as currency. Even that feature tho is being added soon anyway
@_date: 2019-06-28 12:46:31
It's not betting, they hold the Bitcoin the same as a bank holds your money, but it's still yours, the only thing is, as I said, you can't use the coins for purchasing, it's like investing in a stock
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:30:10
It's not over the price, it's just that they buy it at a discount and then we pay them regular price or just a slightly less discounted price. For example if Disney is an even 150$ per share, they'll buy 100 shares for 12,000 instead of 15,000. Even after the transaction fees and such they'll sell them to use for 145-151$ per share depending on certain factors and make profits, while leaving it with no fees. They also make money the same way as other companies selling data, like your email, age, times you're actively buying stocks, what companies you're interested in, ect and sell it to marketing companies collecting data for targeting audience bases
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:20:42
They do no fees because they buy bulk and get special discounts, they take a percentage of the discount to cover fees and make profits. Hence why their prices are decent and still have no fees. Also it literally says they buy it in their terms of service and in fact upon searching on the app I found them even say that although you can't directly withdraw bitcoins they will be implementing it soon. I couldn't copy paste it and I'm not writing 22 paragraphs but it's public info you can search. As for the location I doubt they'd be giving that as public info
@_date: 2019-06-28 01:48:28
That's like saying money in your bank account isn't yours because you don't physically hold it and the bank has your money with other people's
@_date: 2019-08-15 16:58:15
It states clearly on their website exactly how it works and that they'll soon be updating the ability to access keys and use it for purchases. I've yet to see the sell button disappear and since using it btc has fluctuated over 5k$ back and forth multiple times. For an average investor Robinhood is totally fine. If you're investing hundreds of thousands or want to use the currency rn obviously use a wallet but the rh app is very convenient and safe
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:09:25
Interesting, they did just updated maybe it can now? If not I'm not sure. Also, how does one get banned lol
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:35:27
The only thing different is that Robinhood treats it like a stock instead of currency. You can't trade it or pay with it
@_date: 2019-06-28 17:02:21
Listen I'll take the no fees personally ��
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:26:37
You sell the Bitcoin and get money that can go to your bank. You just can't use it as it's own currency, it's treated like a regular stock
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:09:50
Why is that?
@_date: 2019-06-28 16:54:39
Which shit the data selling? If so I don't know for sure they do but in America and Japan virtually every company does it
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:07:36
You could use the Robinhood app. I like it a lot, has all stocks on it too! If u use this app lmk, I'll send you my reference code and it'll give us both a free stock which is also neat. This offer obviously extends to anyone interested
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:00:40
That's like saying the USD is a scam or Bitcoin itself is a scam because there's nothing physical backing it. If I buy BTC Robinhood actually buys BTC and holds it in a group wallet on their end, the same as a bank holds group money. So if I went to my bank account and saw money, is it a scam just because I can't pull out Euro or yen instead of the original cash? It's simple, you buy, sell or options trade, only thing you can't do is use it as a currency
@_date: 2019-06-27 19:51:17
Can you link that? After searching everywhere I cannot find anything even remotely close to this outside of a few parrots on Reddit. In fact the only negative I can find is that you can't use it like a Bitcoin and it's basically just like a stock, which to be fair, I think buying things with Bitcoin is stupid and if you're using it as anything but a stock I think you're shot
@_date: 2019-06-27 20:18:21
Yes I get it, Bitcoin is a "currency" but like 95% of bitcoins are being bought, sold, or  held like stocks, and not like currency, so unless you're dying to run to Starbucks or whatever store actually accepts Bitcoin and pay for something with a highly volatile but overall raising in value currency, Robinhood will let you buy, sell, track and options trade Bitcoin.
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:08:04
This isn't some guy with a trench coat selling shady Bitcoin lol they're one of the biggest stock market apps around rn. Their terms straight up say they but Bitcoin on your behalf and just hold it. Your tinfoil hat is on too tight bro
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:20:05
I've literally not paid an atm fee in years aside from private ATMs that are usually like 1$ lol
@_date: 2019-12-21 17:18:47
That's a huge ass fee, my bank charges nothing to use an atm and a 15$ yearly fee, then I can buy and sell btc for free. Why would this 7% atm be something to be happy about when it's worse than a real atm
@_date: 2019-06-28 13:03:15
They own Bitcoin. Read their policies numb nuts. They just hold it. Literally everything you said is so shot
@_date: 2019-06-28 22:25:49
@_date: 2019-06-27 18:32:30
Also I can have them send me notifications about changes frequently, and get them push to my smart watch via email or other apps
@_date: 2019-06-27 23:07:25
Show me where it says you don't actually own the Bitcoin you buy. Also I'm buying BTC as a stock investment hoping to make money
@_date: 2019-12-21 20:50:55
Get a new bank, TD doesn't charge for that, and don't use 4$ ATM's, I usually pay 0-1$
@_date: 2019-12-22 01:43:28
@_date: 2019-12-21 18:51:35
Seriously, imagine you went to an ATM to withdraw 200$ and the fee was 14$
@_date: 2019-12-21 05:51:10
That's how it works in basically every functioning country even the disfunctional and poor ones.
