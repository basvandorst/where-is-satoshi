For those coins to be yours, you need to own your private key. In Coinbase you are never given your seed( private key) just a public address, since Coinbase it considered a bank they can lock you out of your account and loose your coins. That’s why is always best to have another wallet which you can control. Electrum and hardware wallets come to mind.

Yeah most likely. There’s support at 10600, if it drops below that it’s going to be interesting

According to the great Andreas Antonopoulos we would probably be in our 8th bubble, if the others didnt do shit to crash bitcoin when it was fragile and new, neither will the rest. Thanks for you concern, but dont get mad you didnt get in for easy gains

No fundamentals. A lot like stock is speculation. Behind a stock is a company that’s makes service, product, and other. If the PE ratio is low then we buy the stock because is cheap base on income,balance sheet, cash flow. In bitcoin, We are speculating that this technology, Blockchain, will transform how we exchange money peer to peer. This technology already has track record that it working And is disrupting the financial system, because there is no need for a centralize bank anymore.

I disagree, buy now and keep buying the dips. I do agree rises like are bound for a correction
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:42:59
A buy limit order you set the price of your choosing and wait till the price hits.
Market order buy at price at the moment
Sell limit is the same as buying but selling
Stop loss is a sell order you set at a lower price than what it is now. Either you take loss or profit

that cant be right, they are stealing your money. customize fee are as low $3

That is for stock market. Crypto is volatile as fuck, that a $2000 drop is completely normal. Wake me up when it drops 5k

Keepkey, Exodus( im not recommending this, ive been reading about people getting hacked on Exodus) Electrum, and i have a couple of exchanges to make trades

Thanks for your concern, I guess. We as a community ( bitcoin, not just this sub) have gone through major crashes . Only to be where we are today

@_date: 2017-12-07 21:22:33
Yeah it will be faster. But is it worth it? I would rather safe the $13 and let gdax handle the fee. It will take awhile for your btc to show up in your wallet. I withdrew btc early this morning and im just getting my btc now

What about when they close shop because they ran of new money, your money is going with then. Look up bitpetite, that company ran the same way bitconnect is running. I would stay away
@_date: 2017-12-27 17:48:50
I don’t think that would happen. When crypto start taking money away from central bank they will come down hard
@_date: 2017-12-01 04:55:30
Buy bitcoin(btc). All other are alt-coin
@_date: 2017-12-06 03:04:34

11-12 dark web. Bought weed of Silk Road 
@_date: 2017-12-01 23:58:30
The one I got was ok. They had different strains, to think about it now which is kind of stupid because I live in California. But I wanted to buy weed off the internet. Felt cool. Seeing heroin, cocaine online was a trip, never bought that
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:01:28
For some reason gdax doesn’t add the tx to the mempool right away. After they do you will have to wait till it’s mined 
@_date: 2017-12-27 18:04:20
Why would they want to support something that is decentralize. If they would go with this , they will try to make it centralize to be able to track where the money is going; money laundering, terrorist support etc. of course we don’t support any of these. This is completely against what we stand for and trying to accomplish with these currency

That’s why owning your own private keys is important, if you loose your hard wallet you can back up to original state. For the thief to spend your money will need your pin among other security to do it. Your money is safe. However, If you leave it in Coinbase only 2% would be insured of online wallets. the point of all this, get a hardware wallet
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:52:04
Yes, why not. Alot of people will say if you do so, disconnect from the internet

Ive bought some miners off [minerwarez.com]( They seem to honor purchase and refund since ive dealt with both and they are a US based company
@_date: 2017-12-13 00:02:33
True bitpetite did not have a coin. But Bitconnect has all their coin in one exchange, Theirs(with the exception of HitBTC they only have 3% of the volume). When new money stop flowing in they wont be able to pay old investors. This is scary, when they start closing that exchange you wont be able to withdraw any BCC accumulated or your capital money since its all tied up in this so called volatility bot for almost a year. 
  No company can sustain itself giving out 1% daily unless they get new money, hence the referrals. They depend on new money coming in. I would be careful, im not stopping you in making your money, we all are. But i definitely wouldnt come near it if i was attack with $5 wrench. 
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:12:27
I know, what i meant is bitcoin makes this sudden down swings and upswings all the time that 40% is not even a crash, only to be up 300% the following week. 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:24:45
yup about $60 million at the of time of hack. worth alot more now
@_date: 2017-12-04 02:11:25
No, fees are only applied on the buy and sell. But I also suggest you move your Coins outside of Coinbase into your own wallet
@_date: 2017-12-04 03:02:54
I agree with this to some degree, other than the fact that they're some coins out there with great technology like lite coin,Ethereum and many others like Walton or IOTA. But i will say that 90% of these coins are pure shit. I suggest you do you own due diligence because blockchain, im afraid is here to stay 
@_date: 2017-12-07 21:14:54
You should be good. Gdax pays the fees. I withdrew BTC from gdax this morning, im just receiving it now. Gdax is getting hit with volume right now, it takes awhile

Yeh me too. I’m buying the dip

I agree mining contracts are expensive you won’t make profit after 2 years, but contract expire in 2 years.  
@_date: 2017-12-30 23:18:54
Good question, depends on congestion. 1hr up to 4hrs. But alot of people buy eth, and they sell to bitcoin. Also if i may, i suggest getting a different wallet. If they are charging $50 on customize, thats really bad.
@_date: 2017-12-26 04:05:38
Great read. Im reading that right now. Alot of information
@_date: 2017-12-20 02:08:39
HODLING AND BUYING!!
@_date: 2017-12-08 15:54:57
Yes. 
@_date: 2017-12-02 08:01:15
Yes. Once the order has been filled you will get it. At times it might be slow due to high volume but almost in a couple of seconds

Someone trying to cause a panic, not again

There’s Gemini which also gives the option to withdraw to fiat but it has fees both ways, when you buy and sell. With Coinbase deposit USD into Coinbase, transfer to gdax and you will buy your bitcoin without fees. Also if you withdraw out of gdax, gdax will pay for the fee as well. Good luck 
@_date: 2017-11-28 22:33:43
When you create an account on Coinbase it will also create an account on gdax. There the same company. Go to gdax.com click deposit, and it should point out to “Coinbase account” and transfer within. Once you have your fiat money on gdax buy your bitcoin at your desired price. Make sure when you buy, it’s buyin on limit order, doing so will avoid fee. When you buy at market there’s a fee. 
@_date: 2017-11-30 19:57:27
@_date: 2017-11-30 00:14:02
When you go to gdax.com an account already been created when you signed up on Coinbase ( I think) . When you’ve log in into the platform click deposit a Coinbase account should pop and transfer within. Make sure you buy as a limit order, buying at market still has fees. And also it has to be greater than 0.01 btc to buy on limit

I've heard good things about JAXX. I haven't used them myself so i cant really say. 
@_date: 2017-11-18 03:42:02
So what’s next...
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:13:00
I would be very cautious in leaving your coins in Coinbase. You don’t own your keys. If they get hack your money goes with it too. Hardware such as Trezor, ledger nano s would be the best option
@_date: 2017-11-30 23:42:27
Personally I use keepkey as my hardware. Having things in mobile you still run that risk. but right now not alot of wallets are being made for mobile yet, and probably wouldnt want to if for some reason you get locked out or phone stolen. youre fucked. desktop wallets i like electrum 
@_date: 2017-11-28 17:56:54
WTF!?! Buy bitcoin now
