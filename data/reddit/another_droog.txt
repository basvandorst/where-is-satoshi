I agree. Really brilliant talk. Kudos to AA.
The debate will be solved one way or another and Bitcoin will be stronger for it.

Awesome work

LOL how? They both show the same data, one linear the other logarithmic.
Besides it's not like the chart is extrapolating anything.
Here's some food for thought, at the current trajectory the price will be around $300 at the end of the year. According to this graph that will place it firmly in undervalued territory if past trends continue and there is another wave.

Take a look at  bitcoind doesn't require a supercomputer.

Another reason not to use any of these clouds.

Check out  They let you loan out your bitcoins tied to USD so if bitcoins go up or down it doesn't matter you get the same amount back in USD plus the interest rate. Just be careful not to fall for scammers (e.g. 4000% APR, etc)

That's very good. Keep it running. We can use more nodes. I've got a couple going too.
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:49:47
...and yet I can trade stocks and currencies with 15 minute delays having enough confidence of their past performance to make an informed decision of their current market value.
If the past price was entirely unrelated to the current market value traders would not be looking at the current price which is also in the past, having been determined by the last close.

Precisely. Armory has this functionality.

It would be better if people running full nodes had fixed IP addresses.

There are dozens of definitions for bit none of which have conflicting meanings when taken in context.

Consider that people would rather buy a 1/4 pounder for $10 than a 1/3 pounder for $10 because "4 is bigger than 3" and you will realise that the uneducated will never be ready to understand divisibility of coins.
@_date: 2014-10-30 23:02:19
There is still hope to recover coins through legal action.

1,000,000 bits = 1 Bitcoin.
The added advantage is that people generally dislike fractions and most software assumes that money only goes to two decimal places.

Undervalued how? There is far less adoption of LTC than BTC and there is greater competition in the altcoin space than there ever was.
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:12:34
That was a very informative read. Lee's views are very balanced.

Xapo is already showing bits by default.

Nobody confuses an apple computer with fruit.
Besides information is extremely rarely measured as plain bits.

To anyone that is low on bandwidth that still wants to run a full node or use the original bitcoin client: use QoS.
ddwrt and openwrt support QoS, out-of-the-box most home routers unfortunately don't.

We don't know this isn't a scam with absolute certainty but CryptoCobain is a reputable member of the community and has offered to do multisig with Antonopoulos.
@_date: 2014-08-30 07:14:35
No. The fee is optional and simply speeds up the processing. It's encouraged but not strictly necessary.
@_date: 2014-08-30 09:18:16
Fully agreed. Great idea.

"It would be in our own interest to have the bit on every exchange" doesn't   quite have the same flow now does it?
@_date: 2014-08-30 13:54:27
This isn't a buttcoiner and the chart can be interpreted to make a case for selling as for buying now.
@_date: 2014-08-30 16:05:41
absolutely agreed, especially "barometer of idiocy"

S&amp;P500 is going to crash spectacularly at some point and then bitcoin will do something.

That's what I'm thinking.

I don't know if the announcement is authentic but the Chinese checks out.
@_date: 2017-01-13 06:16:57
So we don't know if this will affect the other Chinese exchanges.

Thanks for your thoughts and insight, even though I don't agree with all of your points. 
I really like that Monero is offering a download specifically for FreeBSD.
You mention Monero is not competing with Darkcoin, how can that be  when both appear to be focused on privacy? Are you suggesting Monero is entirely outside of Darkcoin's league in terms of rigorousness?
@_date: 2015-03-22 13:33:38
Of course he's biased being a developer. That doesn't mean every criticism against Darkcoin is unfounded.
