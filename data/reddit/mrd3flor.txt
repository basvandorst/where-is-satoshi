1 charity tip for me please!
@_date: 2015-06-20 07:29:36
Extra: asked the manager if many bitcoin-guys come around and how his experience is with it: "Great, they come and go, some weeks a lot, other weeks none... Mostly in group. And it works really really great! Very fast!" (he uses bitkassa). Shout out to the guys behind Gent Bitcoinstad for making it a little bit easier to use Bitcoin in Gent! Please do Antwerp! :)

Woops :) below 2000... I would solve the greek crisis in no time with this kind of math ;)
Yeah I got like 18.90 or something, so that was a negative side of it... They sure charge a nice big fat fee...
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:41:45
It does!nice job!
@_date: 2015-06-13 08:49:56
Alright! Thanks for the recap guys! Please do share opinions further... Kinda expected more out of this myself, but mainly because it was hyped everywhere on this subreddit :)
@_date: 2015-06-09 23:11:53
Works like a charm over here in Belgium... Just found out a thrift shop only 5km from my home accepts Bitcoin! I must admit (and I feel a little bit ashamed for it) but I never thought highly of the people running the store... But now? Damn, first time I get a chance I will go over there and just buy something I can use in my new appartment! Thanks guys!!! Keep it up and I would love an android app if possible ;) 
I'm gonna pop some tags, only got 0.09 BTC in my wallet... I'm hunting, looking for a come up, THIS IS FUCKING AWESOME!!!!
Edit: lyrics ;)

Okey thanks you guys!

So if I get this right I will be able to suck my own dick?
@_date: 2015-01-07 08:51:50
All you say is very true... This should not have happened and is not good for consumer adoption and faith in the system. But I still believe we are in the very very early days here and we should expect (not accept!) these kind of things... I'm sure banks also learned to tighten their security in the first hundred years of their excistence... Now we have camera's, insane vaults and security personel. All because previous measures had proven to fail... Bitstamp will learn and will adopt and so will the rest learn a valuable lesson. Basicly this is a big: "Get your shit together or get out. You have 1 shot!"...
@_date: 2015-01-06 22:52:37
I would laugh my pants of if we go to the moon the moment bitstamp is back online. Sounds impossible, so very possibru in btc-land
@_date: 2015-01-06 23:58:44
Well, I follow your point but I disagree... As long as we get out of this, Bitstamp (and hopefully others) learn from this and all customers are made whole as it should, then we grow stronger from this... We are still in very early stages, faults are here to be made, even by the big guys, even though they shouldn't... Let it be a hard lesson for them! Few days of great stress and fixing the fuck-up... Keep them awake, that's always a good thing. Sad it takes 5M in Bitcoin to keep them alert...
@_date: 2015-01-08 17:41:11
When people ask me about Bitcoin, I go on a rampage but always stop half way and say: "I'll stop talking now because I'm talking too much" and they be like "No man, you're just passioned about it, its fun to watch so please keep talking and inform me more."
That's usually the point where I wake up.
@_date: 2015-01-26 09:40:41

@_date: 2015-05-24 22:17:06
Aight, got it fixed, thanks! Great work, love the product! Feels (and is) very safe!
@_date: 2017-01-04 17:16:50
ITS HAPPENING :o
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:12:28
I dont know, it did not give me that option. Worked fine the first few times I tested it with a small amount... I dont get it... :'(
@_date: 2016-11-03 22:52:52
It's all good! Guess I was just panicking: wanting to sell. Thanks to the delay I got to sell at 700 again (otherwhise if instant it would have been 680) ;) Satoshi is smiling on me today ;)
@_date: 2016-11-04 10:19:38
Thanks for the detailed info! Everything is ok now, guess I was just a little bit on edge because of the big amount I sent... But it's nice to see how this community helps out when in trouble... Sometimes, when using Bitcoin, I feel 'alone' since there is not really any saveguard, which is also the thing I like about BTC (no central banks,...). But it's scary sometimes... Nice to know you people are here to help out in a very, very great way!
@_date: 2016-11-03 20:13:07
Pfff I feel for you man! I hope it works out for both of us!
@_date: 2017-11-07 14:18:36
If you fear you may, this might be an excelent time to buy a Trezor or other offline wallet and store your btc or other crypto's offline. This forms an extra barrier to when you feel like doing something you might regret... It helped me out a lot! And also, diversify a bit. Put, let's say 50% of your total crypto investment in the coin YOU believe holds the most value over longer time, 25% in the second one and put those two on an offline wallet. If you do like to 'trade' or try it out, do it with the remaining 25% or less, depending on what you feel comfortable to lose. Because you will lose (and win some times... :) ) Good luck! Stay level-headed!
@_date: 2015-07-06 18:20:45
Not really BTC-news but we all know it is, in a way...
@_date: 2015-07-05 22:12:15
For the record: I feel bad for the people of Greece and I sympathise with them. I can not imagine how hard it must suck for them and I really wish them all the best and I hope they get out of this ordeal ASAP! 
But I am also very excited about the price of BTC (and LTC) at the moment, so there's that...
@_date: 2015-07-06 19:17:23
Yes, this is really, really going to be a huge problem... Wow I just can not imagine what it must be like to live in Greece these days... I mean, what's next? This is one big fuckup that is what it is. After the Oxi-euphoria, this puts them right back into reality... Pfff... Wish I could do something.

According to the townfolk its Bitcoin... But who are they to judge? And to be honest, if someone named ANY altcoin, I would have given them the point!
@_date: 2015-09-14 21:13:42
@_date: 2016-10-01 17:52:23
Thanks! Although I must admit it was mainly my curiosity that was my main motivator. I thought this was a 'hard' question, you know, to make some shifts in points in the top 10 a little bit.
@_date: 2016-10-23 12:32:06
Excuse me! FLEMISH!!!! :)
@_date: 2015-11-03 17:25:48
Looked it up: top not found :(
@_date: 2016-10-01 17:55:38
If anyone is wondering: this was the exact question (not the lay out we used in the ppt ofcourse, just for the jury and presentation): 
Translation: This piece of technology was invented by Satoshi Nakamoto, a guy (or group I should have added, sorry) that to this day remains hidden in mistery. The technology behind this currency is called 'the blockchain' and looks promising for further applications. What is the name of the most popular digital currency?
@_date: 2015-03-05 15:40:11
When a guy is open sourced he is a player, when a woman is open sourced she's called a sl*t! Thats not right people!

Hopefully when I'm awake...
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:19:54
Oh no, I wont actually. My first priority is to regain my lost btc gradually so a nice little correction/bubble burst would be more then welcome. At least I can do what I've been doing in the past: buy more. I went through the '1.000'-bubble. Bought at 900,800,500,300,200,100 and all the way back up... I would not like anyting more then to be able to buy sub-1.000 again, but that is something I think we wont see again any time soon... But 1.500 maybe, if we're lucky :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:10:48
I also learned this lesson the hard way... it sucks, but I guess the only way to learn is to go through it? I dunno... 
@_date: 2016-10-01 17:50:25
This one... 
I know,... Not the one I would show to a tech savy crowd, but hey... ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 11:34:45
I had a urge to do so. Don't know why exactly... I understand why people don't talk about their losses here. I feel ashamed (a bit, it's better now) and it's hard to admit you made a huge mistake, even if no one else but yourself is affected by it. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 19:27:44
I don't know about you guys, but i LOVE this sentence:
"If we wanted to scale and become global, it makes more sense to really go after banks. They already have the infrastructure."
May the old banking hardware be put to good use. Althoug ultimately I dream of a world with nothing but Bitcoin, this is something great in my opinion.

I might start feeling something once we reach 1000. Untill then... walk in the park-feeling.
@_date: 2015-11-02 21:44:10
If your only aim is 'not missing out' like me, just do this: buy dips, hodl, repeat. I keep on buying dips below 520, cause that's my break-even point atm (off course, the more I buy, the lower my break even will be, but I keep 520 as thé figure to stop buying for me).
If you do not know a lot about trading, just dont. This market is to volatile for even advanced traders to handle. At least that's what I think. But hey,who am I?
@_date: 2015-03-13 13:01:18
I was happy with the report untill they said 'bitcoin' has been hacked... pfff...
@_date: 2015-03-07 15:53:04

@_date: 2017-05-25 02:14:11
Thank you. It does! :) And it's nice to see so many people relating or at least feeling sorry for me. Although I REALLY hope some people can learn from my mistakes. I don't have high hopes for that, because I believe people will make mistakes, despite any advice... At least I did/do...
@_date: 2016-10-01 17:51:13
Haha, well, in my part of Belgium (Flanders) they speak Dutch so... Bitcoojn ;)
@_date: 2015-11-02 23:53:36
Yeah did a little bit of spending myself, mainly pizza and other food ;) my waistline expansion is in direct corelation with bitcoin price. Sure we can pull some TA out of that very soonish...
@_date: 2015-03-09 13:32:08
I'll sign for this!

@_date: 2015-10-15 23:56:09
Bitcoin's killer fapp!
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:23:11
Also, I'm clearly not a good trader, so I should not attempt to be :) I'm a good hodler. And I'd rather hold something I know a thing or two about then hold a bag of god knows what (because that's how it felt for me when I was holding xrp a few days)
@_date: 2015-03-27 12:19:09
Trezor does the trick nicely... At least for me... I think it's more a matter of personal liking...
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:41:02
Great tactic! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:58:21
True, thanks to my 'early investing' I'm still well in profit USD-wise. But the BTC-balance took a hard punch... Still sucks, but I'll live :)
@_date: 2015-10-28 02:45:39
Thank god/the devil I fixed that for you ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:00:33
Oh no, had some litecoin bad luck before that :) no worries!

@_date: 2017-05-25 08:57:25
I agree. I actually have a Trezor wallet where I kept my coins for about 2.5 years. I'm considering putting it somewhere in a safe or something. I was going to say 'bank' but let's not make that mistake :p
@_date: 2015-03-06 14:08:55
Just reached 14 a few minutes ago and instantly bought a trezor with it... Something I would advice everyone who still has btc in exchanges just as storage to do.  I know I'm late, have some of my bitcoins sitting in exchange for almost 2 years now, and one day I will pay the price for that. So, secure those precious gems if you havent already ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 09:22:04
Funny thing, that thought got me calm a few hours ago. I mean, I have a few friends who have some part of 1 bitcoin because I kept talking about it and are now thankfull they listened to me. But besides from that, I know no one except you guys over here who actually own &gt;1 btc. Sadly, my stack took a big beating, but it's still a stack I'm proud of. I was going to say 'bag', but that would be just plain wierd in this case :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:59:23
Will do, thanks!
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:04:56
Did we go to the same school?
@_date: 2017-05-25 10:43:01
If I just kept it to myself, no one would be anything with it you know?
If I see the many good, nice, smart reactions here, I am just proud of this community you know? I remember the days this subreddit was just starting out, and it was great then. A lot of newcommers and it's still a very nice place to be. I can imagine I would get roasted for posting this post in some other subreddits for sure. But I feel like some of you might have gone through the same thing and I feel like we are same students at the same school :)
@_date: 2015-10-28 12:34:43
You should realy make this your *signature* dish!
@_date: 2015-11-03 07:17:59
Never said I was a trader :) Bought some cheap, some VERY expensive (read: top ;) ) and some around this time... Which brings the average at +-500
@_date: 2015-11-04 18:28:33
Haha no, I will be a little bit more 'meh, nice' when it passes 520... So I'm sloowly getting a little bit more excited. Like when my gf takes of her sweather... 'hmmm, this might lead up to something...'
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:41:01
Thanks for having me, despite my lack of any sense :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:19:46
I have no doubt in my mind that ripple or other altcoins will rise again. I mean, it's almost a given. But honestly, I feel much better about this, even if it comes at a big loss. The main lesson is I should not have 'invested' (gambled) in something I know little or nothing about and just stick to bitcoin. Because that's what works for ME. Other people might know a tonload about litecoin, ETH, XRP,... Good! I hope they invest smartly and because they believe OR they are good at market movements, if that is their thing they believe in... But for me, it's btc. If the btc-price drops (which I would not be surprised by if it does that soonish) I will just do what I've been doing for the last 3 years: buy a bit more. It will be less then I used to get for my euro's, but at least i'll be buying something I believe in.

Hey u/drawingthesun
First: why do you think you'll get downvoted? I find your reply very helpful and you make some good points.
To answer your questions:
1. Insanity motivated me. And greed...
2. I did not do my due-diligence. None. A huuuuuge mistake... 
I feel like the only way I will ever invest in any altcoin is with fiath, in small bits like I did with btc (read: a few XX euro's a month at most). And AFTER I have at least a fair amount of trust in the altcoin's specs/vision/... 
I too was tempted to try mining a few years back. I almost bought some of those fancy antminers :). I'm very glad I did not, but I can understand why you did look into it...
Good luck to you as well!
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:49:27
I can not do anything but confirm. I'm not smart enough to do anything else. Big respect to the (I believe very few) people who actually can in these crazy markets. They have balls of steel and a brain I can only dream of ;)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:24:47
No worries, my soul was rotten long before even bitcoin came into my life! ;) XRP can have it ;)
@_date: 2015-03-06 15:56:41
If everyone wanted 21, I can't imagine what the price would do :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:45:00
Sidenote: I have nothing against XRP. It just is not for me. I hope the people that invest in it also truely believe in it and are smarter then me, which should not be a problem. I wish the best of luck to them, as to anyone investing in any kind of coin. May we all get a better life out of it or at least become smarter by doing what we like to do ;)!
@_date: 2017-05-25 08:52:42
Pffff, that's a though one man... I can totaly relate! I wish you lots of luck in the future! 
@_date: 2017-05-25 01:50:56
Funny thing is I already learned that lesson with litecoin. At least, I thought so... About 3 years ago I lost a fair amount of btc to litecoin trading. I thought I finaly 'figured it out'. Guess I'm still as stupid as I was before. 
@_date: 2015-03-04 14:52:47
Let's get newsweek on this! They probably think they found Satoshi again...
@_date: 2015-02-28 08:10:05
No. I feel more like E.T. when talking to friends about bitcoin...
@_date: 2015-02-22 11:25:18
If you ever feel confident enough or when your Bitcoin-customers have grown considerably, do a Bitcoin-only day. Where users can only pay with bitcoin and get a nice discount if possible. Depending on what type of business you have, you can also host small/larger bitcoin-evenings/meetings. When doing a BTC-only day, a Bitcoin ATM will be much appreciated...
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:37:31
Great idea! Tell me nothing about it! Just tell me how to deposit! :)
@_date: 2017-05-25 02:09:03
I can not agree more. If I would have read this post 1 year or even 1 month ago I would not believe I would do such a thing. I genuinly believe in BTC and my end goal for the ripple-ride has always been 'get more btc'. I don't understand myself why I ditched my believes in btc down the drain just for the prospect of some quick gains... It's silly, irrational and just plain stupid... But I do want to point out that I'v always actually believed in bitcoin, no matter the price. Friends laughed at me when it dropped down from 1.000 to 160 back in the day and I kept on buying. I have almost zero faith in the current monetary system/banks and when I first heared about btc, it was like 'damn, I'm not the only one and there is some sort of 'alternative' in the makings! this is interesting!"
@_date: 2016-07-07 17:50:55
Aaah thanks a lot guys! I'll look in to those 3!
@_date: 2017-06-21 22:04:11
The more I read about XRP, the more convinced I am it does. So I partly agree with you. But at the time of writing, I knew little to nothing about it and just bougt because it had a nice graph going up. I knew a lot about bitcoin and believe in it. And I should have just stuck to my plan... But I don't mean XRP is a bad investment, just think it's not really my thing...
