@_date: 2016-08-16 03:53:51
It wouldn't cost them "several" billion USD bnecessarily, or even close to that.  They could just offer 20% above BTC price and the whales would come running to sell to them.  And what a great way to cash out for many who are losing faith in Bitcoin...and who can blame them.

Then don't use Coinbase and Circle.  Buy BTC with cash and have your relatives in Mexico sell it for cash.  That is how anyone with a brain and any interest in privacy does it anyway.

They are being "open" but who knows if they are being "open and honest".  They probably are, but we don't know yet.  
My point is that misinformation isn't much better than no information.  And again, I'm not assuming they aren't being honest.

I sometimes wonder if the Democrats are so big on gun control because it is such a polarizing issue and they know it turns about half the country off to them, thus maintaining the balance (oligopoly) of power of the Two Party System.
@_date: 2016-08-16 19:00:10
What a lazy post.  The fact that they owe you 1.7 BTC means little.  If you lost 100 BTC and they only owe you 1.7, then that's not that bad.  If it was 1.9 BTC you lost, then a different story.  But why bother to give relevant details to anyone.
@_date: 2016-08-30 21:34:44
I think I read a year or so ago that the bitaddress.org wallets had some kind of flaw, but they fixed that. Also it's best to download the source .html from the Github repository and then run that on a computer that isn't connected to the internet (and preferably has never been).
I do that and then I save screencaps and text files of my paper wallets and encrypt those files with PGP.  However I view them on my regular online computer, which i probably shouldn't do.
I spend from them with mycelium phone app, which allows you to do that.
@_date: 2016-08-24 16:52:43
Fuck Coinbase.  They have been screwing their customers over for years.  I don't get why people still use them, but go figure.
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:54:51
It's nothing new.  Losers hate winners.  So the losers try to discourage others from trading.
@_date: 2016-08-07 02:58:47
You must be kidding.  You really think they are going to repay the customers any more than a token insignificant amount?   
Note how they don't say that customers will be repaid over time.   They say that eventually, someday, they may buy your "BFX bucks" to pay you back in full.   You should know this will never happen.  They aren't even offering free commissions...instead they are just taking (at least) 36% of our money with a vague indication they will give us more in the future, with few to no details.
These guys have shown that they are either 100% crooks or 100% incompetent, or maybe 50/50.   They lied about swaps being insured, the lied about how much BTC they had in cold storage vs hot wallet, Zane has being lieing repeatedly about various important points since this whole thing happened.
And this isn't my opinion. People have posted Bitfinex's Term of Service in multiple threads and what they are saying now is absolutely contradictory to all of that.  Just a quick browsing of threads will show the obvious.
Anyway I realize it is damage control for all of us at this point and we just have to try to get some of our money back from Bitfinex, but anyone is delusional if they don't realize exactly who and what we are dealing with here.
@_date: 2016-08-03 16:11:54
$5000 was a pretty large scale theft to me. Although I doubt anyone stole it and the coins are just lost.

Yes manual withdrawals are likely the way to go, at least at first, even though they will take longer.   If someone has their withdrawl address locked and hasn't changed in months, then that should speed things along a bit.

Well you may not want to essentially steal from the site on every transaction.  And also the first time you trade with someone, having the funds locked in escrow is not a bad thing and worth 1% in some case.

Well many people meet on LBC and do in person trades, but then continue to do them later off LBC, so they don't have to give LBC the 1%.

I didn't say they owe me anything and that I don't appreciate their efforts.  
I said the shit don't work.  And would have been better if it didn't go live until it did work (a lot better).
But I am thankful that they are trying.

Of course Trump couldn't stop Bitcoin (or other crypto currency) transfers sent south of the border or north of it or anywhere around it.
It's interesting how so many people are 100% oblivious to Bitcoin and the possibility of using it and how you don't need a third party to make transfers.  Of course you would have to convert to fiat in most cases in Mexico to spend it, but that could be a  minor problem..or perhaps a significant one, but one that is at least possible to overcome.
But the guy in that article is saying his mother and father would die if they didn't get the $200 he is wiring to them.  Such a fairly simple alternative solution is out there and he is oblivious to it.
Anyway this article is a reminder of why I love crypto.
@_date: 2016-08-30 18:25:03
Main reason is because the site screwed up and cost me 5000 USD.  But others have had issues with it as well.   I will say don't ever send to an address unless you have the private key written down in as safe place.

Bitcoin will always survive but the question is in what state and with what legality.
@_date: 2016-08-03 23:18:40
They haven't said that and I doubt they will say that.  Maybe they would love to, but legally, it's most likely not an option.

Damn this is probably bad for BTC demand.

That doesn't sound like "works well" if you have to go deep into your files and delete a file every day.
@_date: 2016-04-17 10:57:23
There is no way to tell how long it took for the price to be influenced by the last halving.  It could have been on Day 1.  
But yes of course half the bitcoins being mined per day/week/month will lead to less selling pressure, where mined coins are concerned.
Of course this could be more than offset with higher selling pressure for other reasons...or lower buying support for other reasons.
Again, we will never know for sure how the different factors are playing out, but long-term, it's definitely a bullish element to cut inflation in half.
@_date: 2016-08-12 10:53:45

Being in Canada, you may have some troubles finding Canadian gift cards that American sellers can accept.  But maybe there are Canadian sellers on there as well.  You can also pay with Paypal and moneygram and other options.  If your parents or another adult can help you with it, then would give you more options as far as payment and getting the best rate.  
But at least you can get some BTC to play around with.  if you ant to trade some altcoins, then Poloniex is a good site and no personal info required and no acct minimums.  
Bitfinex is a good exchange for Bitcoin with margin and can trade up to 100x margin on BitMEX if you really want to place some big bets and potentially increase your stash dramatically.

In some instances, the buyers have gone back to the bank after they received their BTC and gotten their cash back and claimed fraud and people have had their bank accts shut down.
There is also "man in the middle" scam, which is related to this as well.   I'm not saying it's totally dangerous but not totally safe either.

Yes those morons give up control of their BTC and put them on exchanges and double their money and then lose 36% of that.  They only end up with like 75% more than what they started with.  Morons.  Buy and hold is the only way to go and then if the Bitcoin price goes down, you lose money.  Hodl!

I'm here to communicate facts and the truth, not to try to get upvotes. I don't need upvotes.  I can make new reddit accounts anytime I get too many downvotes and hurts my account functionality.   Sorry but try harder.

Depends on you, not how much you have.

Yes of course it depends on why the price dropped, which was my original point to begin with.

LOL.  Famous last words and I bet you would say something entirely different if the price dropped to $200 again.

Maybe or maybe not but most likely you wouldn't be saying what you did above and good chance you wouldn't do any dollar cost averaging.

They will just sit on their piles of money and revel in their ignorance.

Sexism!  There aren't hardly any women in the audience. It should be 50/50.  We should blame the Patriarchy for not allowing women to be interested in Bitcoin.  But of course the lack of men in the audience for the Mary Kay speech is fine.

I was just sending $70 to my brother and did it online and seemed to work ok but then I got an email that said that it didn't go through and I had to call them.
So I did that and I was interrogated about when I last saw my brother and how often I planned to send money to him (this was the first time) and how old I am and how old he is and all kinds of other goofy questions.
What a hassle it was and of course I wish I could have sent him BTC instead.
