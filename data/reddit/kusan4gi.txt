btw how much taxes do you have to pay over in the US? In Singapore we are not taxed for capital gains

Thanks. I guess the question now is - what substantiates as "validity"?
I could ask the bank~ :/
I heard of banks closing accounts as soon as they hear cryptocurrency. I just wanna avoid those situations.

If I go to the bank and let them know prior to transactions? 
I can ask the bank if they need to know the source of money too
@_date: 2017-12-04 19:27:22
Yes that is one of my concerns as well. I'll be sure to find out the origin of $

Hi everyone! 
I'm new to the community and I can't contribute much except designing stuff~
So... here is a bitcoin fanart based on the rollercoaster image but more refined + on steroids.

Anyone may use this and make amendments without consulting me. Full permission granted even if you wanna use it for commercial use.
If you want the Ai. file just inbox me.
EDIT* People have been asking for a mobile phone wallpaper version. So here it is:
Thanks everyone and nice to meet you!

Hi everyone again! The previous full artwork had requests for a phone wallpaper so here it is. 
Tried to make it less clutter-y cos of readability but not sure if i achieved that HAHA. Do advise?
(click image to view it properly. the preview looks washed out)
Put in a night sky with a moon but thats from a stock vector (too lazy to draw one today after 12 hours of vectoring the full artwork yesterday).
Again, feel free to use to your discretion; nobody's gonna sue you.
Full artwork link on previous thread here:
