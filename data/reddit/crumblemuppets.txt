In your view, what, specifically, are we waiting for? Lightning network? Eventual block-size increase by consensus? Why do incremental increases now preclude eventual implementation of whatever protocol you're envisioning? I understand the risks of centralization presented by rapid block-size increase, and that does seems significant. Not saying BCH is an answer here, just curious what our end game should be.

I'm praying for a small correction before moon. I sold off 1/3 of my bitcoin for an average of ~9650 thinking I could get back in lower and buy some litecoin with my winnings. I'm obviously very nervous now :/

Lol dude! You must be replying to someone else's comment. I literally asked for your opinion/insight in a respectful way, and rather than answering my questions, you made assumptions about a position that I explicitly avoided and put words in my mouth. Thanks anyway! Next time I won't assume your ideas are valuable.

You're predicting an imminent drop?

If it's up to users to activate SegWit on their wallets, we need to start a campaign to raise awareness about the process and the benefits of adoption.
We could start a crowdfund-based ad campaign that shares concise info and offers small bitcoin rewards for adoption. I'll do some research on this and create a thread tomorrow

Just tried it again, and, once again, I regret it immensely. Too many random things have to align for it to work out. 
When it comes to buying with new funds, I think it's somewhat reasonable to watch for downward price action and start setting up limit buys with inverse price/quantity correlation. But to try to sell high and expand your holdings buy re-entering at a lower price is a fool's game. I've just proved that to myself yet again

Yea my initial thought was: absolute volume seems far less important than total volume, because people still tend to measure their investments in fiat to some extent. So, a guy who invested a thousand dollars in 2012 would have had a waaay wilder ride than that same guy today.
However, if bitcoin really reaches 100k usd as many hodlers here speculate, that could totally change the way we view the value conversion to fiat. At what point do we start talking about a volatile dollar fluctuating wildly around a stable bitcoin? Just some thoughts I've been considering. Cheers man

Oh I see; you're looking at the massive number of buy bids. Which site/exchange are we looking at there? Thanks for the heads up

Are you saying Korean traders are gonna dump BTC and pump BCH over the weekend? So transfer BTC from wallets to exchanges now to facilitate selling when price starts to tank? Just want to make sure I'm understanding you

There have been so many posts like this with essentially the same format and content that it does begin to raise suspicion. And I am by no means an ideologue; I hate extreme reactionary partisans on both sides and just want what's best for bitcoin

Seems like volatility has been trending downward as adoption and price have skyrocketed. Sure, the absolute volume and fiat value swings are immensely larger, but relatively it's been a lot more stable than in the early days. I would expect this trend to continue

Yea I guess I'll just have to wait it out and see. Looking at it all the damn time is driving me mad

Nope, you're mis-reading my comment. I asked a question and did not state a position. I'm long on bitcoin and using it as an investment vehicle/store of value and a very occasional medium of exchange. In the instances where I've taken advantage of the latter function, I've had no complaints about fees or transaction times, as any fees have been offset by massive vendor discounts - discounts offered precisely due to its success as an investment vehicle. I have thus tended to view BCH at best as a hasty or unnecessary distraction, and at worst as a potential threat to the stability of bitcoin from within.
That's why it's so absurd to me that my simple, earnest question is being met with hostility and wildly misguided assumptions about my views. I actually wanted information about how we might improve the stability and utility of the network going forward but clearly I need to seek this information elsewhere

That's rough. I have my own horror stories. Sold 5 ethereum at 10 bucks each. Lost or spent 10+ bitcoin in 2013 that I'd bought for ~80 bucks each. This time feels different. Should have learned my lessons by now. Oh well I'll pray for a dip I guess. Can't keep going up like this forever, right?

1) (550/.85)*3900=~$2,500,000. Congratulations and best of luck

Hey, thanks for the reply and helpful explanation. I was also thinking along those lines - that Coinbase would honor its promise to reward customers with BCH based on their account balance at the time of the fork. I guess I was just concerned that Coinbase would look instead at the account balance upon implementation of BCH withdrawals/trading in January. Their Aug 3 announcement doesn't make it particularly clear,  but I guess we have to assume the logical outcome. Thanks again and happy hodling
