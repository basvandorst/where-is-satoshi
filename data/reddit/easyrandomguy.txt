ah ok. i can see how mycelium is more decentralized in that sense. however, isn't there a central database that stores seller's ads and locations? otherwise, how do we find other buyers/sellers?

no they would just regulate other centralized 3rd parties, which i honestly don't have a problem with. this is how you prevent things like mtgox from happening in established financial markets.

localbitcoins is a decentralized exchange. it's nice because it does exactly what mycelium local trader does but with your localbitcoins account. but i think it's good they both do this. the more redundancy in the system, the better.

i recently helped a friend understand this by using the metric system. he just wanted a dollars worth, so i sent him 3 millibits (millibitcoins). most people are familiar with the metric system, so i just explain that 1 bitcoin = 1000 millibitcoins, just like millimeters, or milliliters, or any other metric unit. it clicked really quickly in his head while emphasizing the commodity nature of bitcoin as opposed to thinking of it like a traditional currency.

regulation would make it illegal for scumbags like him to even operate. the bitcoin world is full of scammers. it's a good example of a completely unregulated economy. people are getting ripped off everyday. it's ridiculous and it's horrible for bitcoin's image. but then again, the bitcoin world is full of naive fools, and a fool and his money are easily parted... so... we'll see where this unregulated free market libertarian economy takes us... maybe after all this, we'll find novel solutions to these problems a regulated economy doesn't have to face.

i'd like to see these guys succeed, but in the meantime, all we have are rules and regultors. i don't trust exchanges that provide no recourse incase they run off with everyone's money. btce, cryptsy, all those guys are great, but i know not to trust them with more than i can afford to lose. even some of the most reputable exchanges, like bitfinex and bitstamp, can run off with everyone's money. what do we do when that happens? who do we turn to? the law? the government?
it's funny how bitcoin removes counterparty risk, but trading bitcoin requires you to be exposed to that risk. if we could somehow get rid or reduce the counterparty's role, we could have a better, more decentralized system. but for now, all we have are centralized exchanges.
i'm not saying regulation fixes everything. look at bernie madoff and the financial crisis. but atleast we can prevent things like pirateat40 and mtgox from happening again...

there's no definite answer to this, but if you look at the long term logarithmic charts and compare each bubble to the previous bubbles, you'll notice that the trend has been less and less volatility over time as market depth and liquidity increases. the short answer is, as market cap and price increases, so does stability, naturally resulting in less volatility over time.

give people a bitcoin balance, similar to the ones mining pools have. then reward them with bitcoin micropayments similar to how mining pools do it. and just like mining pools, give them a safe and secure way to withdraw their funds to their own wallets.
infact, your model doesn't sound too different from most mining pools. instead of people calculating hashes for you, they'll be giving you barometric data instead. and you give them bitcoins the same way pools give miners bitcoins.

not at all. filipinos have a hard time buying "luxury" tech goods like laptops and desktops that we would consider pretty basic. they don't have the financial infrastructure (credit cards, paypal) to be able to buy normal luxury goods from abroad. not to mention the prevalence of fraud. bitcoin solves this for honest individuals and businesses by making it easier to buy high quality foreign products without having to use credit cards or conversion rates. instead of asking relatives to buy something for them on newegg and have it shipped to them, now they can buy directly from newegg, or hong kong, or china, and have it shipped directly to them.

if there was a decentralized exchange that didn't really on fallible humans, then there wouldn't be a need for government help. this isn't about decentralized currency. this is about centralized exchanges. look at mtgox. you're entrusting these people with a lot of money. some people with their lives. you don't just want them running off with it, because then that would be theft, and that is what government is there to deter. to administer justice and enforce contracts.

ebay, amazon, walmart, newegg, google, facebook, android, apple, the mmo community, etc... basically, all major online retailers.
with ebay, instead of focusing on ebay itself, you might wanna promote bitcoin to the vendors directly.

@_date: 2013-09-20 04:20:22
i actually just googled bitcoin derivatives and the first thing that came up was icbit. personally, i've never used icbit and i've actually never heard of them before. i think since bitcoin is already digital, there wasn't much need for something like a gold futures contract. i don't know how forex will implement bitcoin. i think derivatives/futures contracts would pertain more to mining. some examples:  
  
  
i think one of the biggest problems with bitcoin at the moment are the exchanges. they're too centralized. they're a single point of failure. i'm not sure if this is correct, but from what i understand, forex is somewhat decentralized? if so, do you think forex would play a major role in stabilizing bitcoin exchanges? would it provide more points of entry? could forex help bitcoin become more resilient?
gold and silver were currencies of the past. fiat for the present. bitcoin is for... the future? the currency of the internet?

lol i don't run a full client, and don't recommend it. electrum is a good alternative. on android, i like using mycelium. there really is no point to running a full client in most cases. i feel that dealing with addresses and private keys is fundamental to properly using bitcoin. bitcoin already provides decentralization and security, and dealing with addresses and private keys is a necessary evil to reap these benefits.

"As of July 2011, Mt. Gox handles over 80% of all Bitcoin trade." source: 
i was speaking in the past tense. i now they've lost market share since then, but the decentralization of bitcoin exchanges pales in comparison to the decentralization of forex.


quoting the localbitcoins price shows you really don't know what you're talking about. localbitcoins uses the mtgox price as a base price, and most people buy and sell over or under that base price (their "spread", aka markup). source: i use localbitcoins


i don't think you should compare localbitcoins to the black market.

Bitcoin is the currency of the Internet: a distributed, worldwide, decentralized digital money. Unlike traditional currencies such as dollars, bitcoins are issued and managed without any central authority whatsoever: there is no government, company, or bank in charge of Bitcoin. As such, it is more resistant to wild inflation and corrupt banks. With Bitcoin, you can be your own bank.

honestly, i can't picture the type of people who send remittances to adopt bitcoin. unless they get paid in bitcoins, it's just too much of a hassle. convert their pay in dollars to btc, remit to family, find counter party, convert back to local currency. that last part, finding the counter party, is going to be the hardest part. it's just too much hassle compared to currently available methods, and after all the exchange fees, it's not necessarily cheaper either.

open up the beta so we can warm up to the system and give you guys feedback. allow us to use testcoins or really small amounts so the risk of losing our own bitcoins is minimized. and offer incentives for sellers, like 0% lifetime commission for trying out and giving feedback during the beta.
i think the biggest hurdle for me is trusting a new, unproven web wallet. what guarantees and safeguards will you have for preventing hacked accounts? will you replace our bitcoins if the lose is not our fault, like what happened at bitcoinica? will you allow us to run ads while our web wallets are empty and we just fund escrow ourselves?
@_date: 2013-10-13 21:55:49
yeah... try reversing a cash deposit, western union, moneygram, postal order, or cash in the mail... my rule is, no release unless i have cash in hand.
btw, for the most part, it's a bad idea to sell bitcoins to strangers with paypal, but if they have super good feedback, that risk is extremely small. you can sell your bitcoins to someone for paypal, just make sure they have a really good reputation score.

i think most of the traders on lbc are low volume and under the radar. i don't think the government has the resources to go after everyone. they mostly go after the big guys, like exchanges. and even then, they're basically making a crime out of buying and selling bitcoins. that's absurd. it's not like they're selling guns or drugs. also, i think they're more concerned about preventing money laundering than screwing over legitimate users. low volume users aren't really the problem. they're looking more for guys that do significant amounts of volume and could be involved in laundering money. but we'll just have to wait and see. as far as i know, they haven't been going after the small guys yet.

hey olaf,
what if you had user-specified validated addresses? let's say i'm a long time trusted user, and i always send my coins to the same address. i mark this address as trusted and validated, and i can send instant buy coins there no problem. otherwise, the coins would have to wait 4 days before they can be sent to any other addresses. if my account gets hacked, they can only send instant buy coins to my validated address. otherwise, they would have to wait 4 days for those coins to clear. on top of this, requiring 2FA to verify external withdrawals would also cut down on the fraud.

it's reading horror stories like this that convinced me to use 2fa and cold storage. how anyone can risk $8000 in mtgox without proper security is beyond me... unless maybe they're filthy rich.
one bright side to getting into bitcoin is that it has thought me a lot about cyber security, from 2fa, to cold storage, to linux live boot cd's, to tor. it's been an awesome learning experience.
but you're right, the key to increasing bitcoin adoption is definitely keeping it stupid simple. right now, bitcoin is kinda like unix and dos. maybe right now we're at the early stages of GUI's, like windows 3.0. what we need to increase adoption is something like the windows 95 of bitcoin.

i wasn't saying it wasn't.


Forex is a "decentralized" exchange. Bitcoin is a decentralized currency.  
Exchange != Currency  


but a decentralized exchange is what bitcoin needs. see mtgox vs fbi.
my point was that even though bitcoin is a decentralized currency, with mtgox handling over 80% of all trades back in july 2011, the exchanges were not decentralized and open to attack. this is why i think being on Forex, the largest decentralized currency exchange in the world, would be a good thing for bitcoin.

both sides are prone to bias. western studies may have an economic agenda, and chinese studies seem to have more of a political agenda. however, i lean more towards studies done in asia since their experience with acupuncture is far more extensive than ours. but i also try to filter out the political bias, so i put more weight on studies from asian countries that are technologically advanced and friendly to the west, like japan, south korea, taiwan, and hong kong, in that order. i'd be wary of studies coming out of mainland though.

yeah... take a decentralized currency and put it in a centralized web wallet... then *"set up an encrypted wallet on your own server... ...to decentralise away from the model of a small number of globally trustworthy banks"*...
you do realize that bitcoin already accomplishes this by being a *decentralized cryptocurrency*? and that all you really need is a private key in a paper wallet to act as your "password"?
the whole point of bitcoin is so you can manage your own money without depending on any banks or counterparties, eliminating counterparty risk. the solution you're proposing is kinda redundant.

put this website on a thumb drive: 
make a live cd or thumb drive with this: 
start up tails on a computer disconnected from the internet. run bitaddress.org from usb drive. print paper wallets. transfer bitcoins to paper wallets. store in safe place.
this ensures your private keys are never exposed to the internet. make sure of this. the public addresses are ok to put on the internet. you can't take your coins with the public address. only the private key lets you control your coins.

actually, i haven't done the math. but, if you're rich in bitcoins, and you don't want your relatives back home to have to deal with currency conversion, this seems like a viable option.
it's tricky figuring out which method is cheaper, because you're dealing with three currencies: usd, php, and btc. and all those currencies fluctuate. and there's friction every time you do a conversion. i guess my advice would be this:
if you have usd, just send it using traditional methods.
if you have bitcoins, send it to the bitcoin trader and have him make a cash deposit.

they'd probably have to use mBTC. also, with regards to volatility, they could just let the users handle that and set the price themselves. seeders can sell their extra GB's for mBTC, and leechers can improve their ratios by buying GB's with mBTC. it can be like a little GB&lt;&gt;mBTC exchange.

i see... it's like how paper and metal aren't really worth anything, but when you turn them into coins and paper money, "coloring" them, then they're actually worth something... and we can extend this concept to stock certificates... the raw material, paper and ink, aren't worth anything, but the underlying meaning behind it, the "color", is what gives it value... so a satoshi isn't worth much, but when it's colored, it's worth something else...
would this concept be similar to poker chips? the actual chips aren't worth much, but the colors give the chips value...?
or... let's say you're playing a card game with your friends, and you're gambling, but you're all broke and all you have are coins (laundry money, pennies, nickels, dimes, etc...) so you agree that these coins are actually worth 100x their face value (1 cent = 1 dollar) and to distinguish them from other coins, you "color" them...?

you're acting as your dad's counterparty. you're assuming that you're more reliable than blockchain or coinbase. this is what i would recommend for your dad:
* largest amount of bitcoins meant for savings and as a store of value (what you would put in a savings/investment account), put it in offline cold storage/paper wallet and keep it somewhere very safe.
* some bitcoins, like in a checking account, i would put in a paper wallet and keep somewhere safe but easily accessible.
* then you have disposable bitcoins, like an amount you would keep in your wallet, for convenience, but you can afford to loose. this i would keep on blockchain.info and sync between all his devices. there are other ways to do this, but blockchain.info seems to be the easiest and most supported method.
using these methods, you're teaching your dad to be his own bank and not rely on other counterparties to keep his money/bitcoins safe.

also, ask 10 different doctors the same question and you'll get 10 different answers. it's a medical joke, but it highlights the point that doctors from different specialties will each have their own perspective and solution for a problem. and how is your average patient suppose to figure out which one to listen to... they're asking because they lack specific knowledge on the subject matter, and you expect them to discern if the answers are accurate and true?

this is nothing new. if you checkout they call these people "whales". they're people with large amounts of capital (fiat or bitcoin) who can influence large movements in the currency markets. some of them are those bitcoin "oldtimers" who mined massive amounts of bitcoins back in the day. others are just people with a lot of money. because of bitcoin's relatively shallow market depth, it doesn't take a whole lot of capital to influence it's price (relatively speaking). for an idea on what it would take to push bitcoin to a certain price level, [checkout the order books]( pay attention to the bottom graph, where the red and green line meet in the middle. someone would have to buy 8023 bitcoins to push the price up to $150. conversely, someone would have to sell 6600 bitcoins to push the price down to $135. that may seem like a lot to the average person, but compared to major markets, that's relatively shallow. the phenomenon of whales making a big splash in the market is nothing new. a lot of bitcoin's volatility can be attributed to these events. but the thing is, for every whale that sells, there's another whale that buys. whales eating whales. so in the end, it evens out. whales can lead to volatility, but that's not what's going to kill bitcoin.
edit: in response to his story of the oldtimer dumping his bitcoins and devaluing the currency, my response would be to buy up those bitcoins while they're cheap. it's not going to change the fact that there will only be 21 million bitcoins ever made.

you're speculating either way. if bitcoin goes down, you'll be glad you converted to dollars. if bitcoin goes up, you'll be kicking yourself for not holding on to those bitcoins. you could cash out what you need to cover costs and expenses, saving the rest. or you could just hold on to it and pay out of pocket. it's totally up to you. i'm not going to tell you what to do with your bitcoins.
however, i dunno if you've noticed, but people here are always having a hard time obtaining bitcoins. coinbase isn't always reliable, wiring money to mtgox, bitstamp, or btce is a pain, and the mark up on localbitcoins is extremely high. if i were you, i'd hold on to those bitcoins or turn around and sell them to people for cash. or support the bitcoin economy and buy stuff with them: @_date: 2013-12-14 02:23:01
i can see private torrent sites using bitcoin to pay for better ratios... imagine being able to receive bitcoins for seeding... or being able to pay in bitcoins for better ratios...  to be able to freely trade bitcoins for uploaded data... torrent sites are going to get a lot more interesting... they would essentially become bitcoin/data exchanges...
@_date: 2013-10-20 07:11:20
please explain to me exactly how ripple helps facilitate the bitcoin to fiat exchange and vice versa.

asian rn here. acupuncture is effective as an analgesic, but not as an anesthetic. acupuncture anesthesia is actually at the center of the traditional eastern medicine vs western medicine debate. it has very deep historical and political roots. it's actually quite interesting.

that's a really confusing chart... is there one for bitstamp?

i don't get this reference...
@_date: 2013-12-14 10:56:46
i'm not sure how exactly this would work... would this allow bitcoins to be freely traded for data? do i get bitcoins if i seed? can i get faster speeds if i give some bitcoins? will this go to the seeders? will the tracker take a cut? i see a lot of potential, but i'm curious how it will be implemented.

i still think we need to get washington addicted to this new bitcoin money, so they can see real benefits to supporting bitcoin.

make him paper wallets from this place: 
use 1, 5, and 10 bitcoin increments for secure paper wallet storage. it's easier to understand cause they look like cash, except they're worth a lot more :D
i'm only suggesting cold storage and paper wallets to secure very large amounts. for small amounts, convenient web wallets are ok.
@_date: 2013-10-12 04:09:43

@_date: 2013-11-06 04:49:44
but what if it's these little hype posts that pushes bitcoin to $1,000?
@_date: 2013-11-04 07:30:23
this is why i still use paypal. with bitcoin, i'd still need an escrow. i figure, if i'm going to need to use an escrow with bitcoin, why not just use paypal?
@_date: 2013-08-11 06:56:48
it is good for bitcoin. we need more diversity and competition among exchanges. less volume for mtgox means more volume and more room for growth for new exchanges.
@_date: 2013-12-14 21:45:16
tech wise, i think women are more into things like social media and cell phones. if we can see a similar application with bitcoin, a social aspect, i think women would be more interested. and no, i don't just mean although that is where a lot of females that use bitcoin reside...

so... explain to me how colored coins can aid in exchanging fiat to bitcoins and vice versa?
@_date: 2013-09-06 21:03:43
most places require 3-6 confirmations, so that's really 7.5-15 minutes vs 30-60 minutes. 15 minutes vs 60 minutes is a big difference. but i see your point about green addresses. thanks for sharing. i can see those being handy and increasing adoption for web wallets.
@_date: 2013-08-27 05:11:49
[i dunno man...](
alright look, i'll take venmo, but i won't release the escrow until the bank clears it. deal?
@_date: 2013-11-02 02:50:09
mill sounds like a grinding mill. [A Milli]( is more commonly associated with money (a million dollars) in popular culture. and since this is about increasing adoption with the general public, calling it a milli will help people perceive bitcoin as a legitimate currency.

some of the sellers with the best rates on localbitcoins only take okpay, which from my understanding is based in the middle east. u might wanna check them out:

@_date: 2013-09-20 03:10:09
so what you're saying is... gold futures contract is just paper gold, not actual gold. this makes sense for gold, since gold is a physical commodity. but bitcoin, being digital, is a totally different animal. are you saying bitcoin on forex would be something more like  than mtgox?

this is what bitcoin competes with. i can see the hawala dealers settling in bitcoin, but i don't see their customers abandoning the hawala system their familiar with and simply switching to bitcoin.

@_date: 2013-09-15 02:55:05
ask them first. see if they would be interested in it. otherwise, bring them something from your country that matches their interests. however, it's always good to ask them what they're into before hand.
i kinda see bitcoin paperwallets as giftcards. a little hard to use if no one accepts them in their country, but they don't expire and they make a nice souvenir. kinda like giving them currency from your home country. maybe make a bitcoin paper wallet with a theme from where you're from? but make nice looking paper wallets though. gifting is all about presentation.
international decentralized gift cards... that's a good description of bitcoin... if they loose it, forget about it, or don't use it in 10 years, you could always get your bitcoins back...

i'm sorry, i didn't realize offering products that appealed to women was sexist. i guess every department store with a women's section, every cosmetics store, and basically everything that offers products for women are sexist too?

subscribed! i do some trades on lbc, so i would love to try out your beta! some questions and suggestions:
will you have a web wallet that stores our coins? i don't like the idea of a web wallet because it exposes our coins to unnecessary risk, but if you do decide to require one, please have 2FA and email confirmation for withdrawals and releases. This would really help cut down on the "hacked" accounts.
also, how will you handle escrow? will it be centralized through the site? or will you have a decentralized escrow market with ratings?
@_date: 2013-09-14 16:54:47
it's the different payment methods and reputations of the sellers. you have to take risk into consideration and price accordingly. think how bitcoin sellers on ebay are charging a ridiculous markup due to paypal chargeback risk.
@_date: 2013-11-03 18:54:41

i'm just saying that most products offered for bitcoins are geared towards men. however, women also do a lot of online shopping, just for different things. if these things can also be bought with bitcoin, that's a step in the right direction. i think some sellers on etsy are already doing this. however, what we need are major brands accepting bitcoin. something that can make the news, like "Louis Vuitton Accepts Bitcoin!". i think this would be good publicity for high-end designers because it adds an element of geek chic and assumes that women are smart, capable, and willing to adopt new technologies, like bitcoin.

ok, so let me get this straight... i have to sign up to a gateway, and afaik  [snapswap]( is the only gateway in the us. so i sign up to a gateway, i buy myself some ripples, and... i trade these for bitcoins? explain to me how this simplifies the process again...?
@_date: 2013-10-28 08:15:33
i'd like them to be honest and upfront with their vetting process and how reliable the information is. i also don't think the doctors should be anonymous. when famous people do AMA's on reddit, they have to verify with the mods. CoinMD's verification process should be better than this. also, a verifiable feedback system from patients, how their treatment went, etc... this way, bad advice can get negative feedback. you can't really ban a site like this, unless you're in the US. but there are reasons customer protections exist, especially in healthcare.
@_date: 2013-10-14 19:38:26

@_date: 2013-10-28 07:07:46
1. bitcoin is peer reviewed. will these professional medical opinions also be peer reviewed?
2. yes, but people are going on there seeking medical advice. they want someone who knows what they're doing. perhaps a feedback system would be a good idea, as well as professional credentials, etc... so people can have a better understanding of who is giving them advice.
3. btw, u do know there are services that allow you to call a nurse 24/7 right?
