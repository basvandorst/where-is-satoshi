Since you're talking about a micro brigade, I'll link you to [my comment on a post here a couple of days ago] ( .   We're a group of 100 odd young people from India who are sending out relief packages!

Hello people. I am an Indian citizen living in Dehradun, the capital of the state Uttrakhand. It is the state adjacent to Nepal and we have an open border here. The other two states Uttar Pradesh and Bihar have themselves been affected by the earthquake and cannot put out as much help.  
I am a volunteer in a local NGO called MAD (Making a difference). We have scheduled a meeting tomorrow morning (9:00am IST) wherein we will be planning to collect funds and simultaneously send out packages of food, basic first aid, etc to Nepal via Trucks and small loaders that we have arranged.  
We had pulled off a similar campaign during the 2013 Uttrakhand Floods and it proved to be of great help.  
 While we, being a youth organisation have tried to collect as much as we can, nothing is going to be sufficient at this time of disaster. My bitcoin address is  1FAUd32UgToqD3A6Y6tNACmGiRbWBseKv5 . I request one and all to please donate whatever you can. 
Also, if there is someone from India who can help us with the arrangements, kindly inbox me. Any help small or big, will be of great use to us! 
You can also inbox me if you have other ideas that we as a 100 member youth organisation can implement to help the people out there!
Thank you.

We have been covered by local news papers in the past. I am hoping that it counts as a legitimate proof. [Official Website]( ... News- [1]( [2](   [3]( [4](

We do have a website:  
  
A quick google search for "Mad in dehradun" can lead you to coverage of our works.  
Let me know if you need anything else for a proof. I will be more than happy to prove mine and my organization's authenticity.
