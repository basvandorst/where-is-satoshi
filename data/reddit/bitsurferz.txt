I just read through that and you somehow think that makes you look better? Everyone deletes old annoying threads with trolls, wouldn't you?
@_date: 2016-04-20 00:00:16
Congrats for the most agro troll post yet! No wonder people say that Bitcoin can't work because of the trolls and f-wads. 
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:18:34
I promise you no one on earth wants to put their hands in your pockets for any reason. Sorry.

Identity happens regardless of whether the citizen wants it or not. So regardless of whether or not you have an ID, the government, if interested, will track you even if you don't want them too. Hell, your face was probably photographed a thousand times this year alone without you knowing it, by stores, etc. So what you are suggesting is that we should just keep the bad surveillance aspect of identity and throw away the beneficial (resumes, hiring, schooling, ability to buy a house or escape conflict). The ONLY people who dislike identity already benefit from really good identities. They have strong passports etc. You are definitely one of them. So stop kicking out the ladder for a volunteer system for those who want what you have. You're ignorance is a form of extreme bias and selfishness.

man he must have really hurt you. you sound like an ex-wife.
@_date: 2016-04-21 17:13:07
just saying. sorry you are in pain. perhaps seek counseling.

Did you see his vid? Its not clear it gives any power to the government.
@_date: 2014-02-04 18:26:34
how is that done? how is attacking one address easier?
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:54:50
but that's true even with POW. If you know you can win three blocks in a row, regardless of your hashing power, you can run double spends.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:08:18
You're correct. In a way. But the biggest mistake of economics is to assume rational actions by rational actors (this was a big failing with communism which assumed every individual just wanted a steady job and a regular house). Many actions are not made for financial benefit. People get it fights in playgrounds over pick-up basketball games. Neither one would benefit financially, but both stand to lose a lot (hospital, health etc). Further, at such low costs 51% its not clear that you can't short bitcoin, then run the attack and then profit.
Finally, and I think its important to note, is that POW does not get more expensive every day. That's a myth. Moore's law pushes the price of ASICs down in a curve that is directly opposite to the amount of people joining bitcoin and mining. So it has tended to stay flat. Two years ago a 51% attack was about the same (realistic) price as today.

There are dozens of phishing attacks going on right now. One started with texas bitcoin conference and hit nearly all the bigs in the community. other BIG bitcoin mailing lists were hit.

its not proof of stake. its an algorithmic proposal that can protect proof of work and speed up transactions.

As an imperialist and fascist I find it troubling that I'm so alone. I'm saving bitcoins to buy gold. I know its strange. But what else would I make my throne out of? Silver and bronze are tacky.
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:51:28
good question. daily intake could be around $1million. So even if they did it honestly, it would pay off in just a week or so. Its important to realize that for a chip fab, bitcoin may not even be on their radar yet. They deal with billions of dollars a month.
@_date: 2014-04-02 02:29:16
so true. gotta love folks who get even more angry when they realize they were angry for no reason. wonder why we have war...answer's right there.
@_date: 2014-06-14 14:51:11
what am i missing. For every advantage that 2-of-2 offers, there are massive negatives. You can't have your money on an exchange with bids and offers. The company that holds the other key can lose their half, meaning you lose your funds.
@_date: 2014-02-03 23:22:18
Where is this theoretical risk written up? I'm not buying that it makes life riskier at all. If you're gonna brute force one public address, you might as well just brute force all of Bitcoin if you're at it, realistically sounds just as easy. No public keys needed.
@_date: 2014-04-23 19:27:14
Bogus, maybe. But I would however err on the cautious side (assuming lower numbers than what we can calculate with given numbers). Bitcoin folks are way too confident and optimistic. Mt Gox proves that. And history shows that thieves &amp; terrorists can be clever folk (not all of them get caught). For example, few would have thought it possible to bomb the USA via the World Trade Center for just the price of a few airplane tickets. Likewise, Bitcoin's swagger in the face of possible attacks is a bit eerie.
@_date: 2014-04-23 17:44:31
20 Million is a fair calc for any exec at a semiconductor fabrication plant. Bitcoin forums discussed this many times. There are a number of big ones fabs, all of them could produce 33-51% of the world's ASICs in a couple hours : cost, under 1 million. Connecting them to computers, perhaps another 10 million/logistics/soldering. 15 million tops.

you always this grouchy when you're wrong. you're free not to use coinbase.
@_date: 2014-04-23 18:35:48
Incentives matter. Every time. But they often aren't financial. Pride. Jealousy. Embarrassment. Fun. All can be stronger incentives than cash. So, the lower the financial barrier, the more it makes Bitcoin a target to even rich folks who got in an argument last night and then just claimed they could shut down bitcoin. Few would argue that if you could run a 51% attack for a dollar, that no one would do it even if it wasn't beneficial financially.
Two years ago on the forums they were saying things like 15-50 million for an attack.
@_date: 2016-01-17 22:40:04
We're already in the middle of centralization problems, and no hardware or software fix is going to solve the problem. James' analysis looks correct.
@_date: 2015-08-17 04:19:59
No. You're not. There's at least two of us.
@_date: 2016-02-25 01:22:42
Ah, so the metric you are using is your opinion. That's always a nice one! Lol.
@_date: 2016-02-24 17:18:43
So there is no metric. Good for him. Especially since Vorhees himself in his original comment said there's been no change in the pace of regulation.
@_date: 2016-02-25 03:49:15
You're silly. You got no metric. But you do love yourself. 
@_date: 2016-02-25 02:09:26
Scalia used 'originalism' as his main form of reading the constitution. But most legal scholars will say that 'originalism' was just a cover he had for making shit up. Sounds like you appreciate Scalia's approach to judging Brito's "work." Do you like how I put "work" in quotes. Because without having a single metric to determine if he's doing his job, well, then its hard to even call it a job. 
@_date: 2016-02-24 23:34:10
Gotcha. Brito meets with regulators, then he makes videos telling us how he's doing a good job, and then a number of organizations send him money. Good deal. I'd like a job where I oversee myself too.
@_date: 2016-02-23 21:04:06
Ah ha. I get it. So Brito would have an incentive to make sure there is regulator pressure so that he can turn to Coinbase and ask for more cash. Nice.
@_date: 2016-02-24 02:19:15
And what metric do you use to determine that he's doing his job well, especially since his twitter post clearly suggests a conflict of interest?

sign up or you mean mop up, or worse? perhaps give us a good reason/set of credentials that meant coinbase had to have you...or stop pounding on people for no reason.
@_date: 2013-11-08 12:24:41
Again, the same problem persists with your solution...It doesn't avoid the issue ALL...
Here's why...
What if Armory has figured out some way to make it seem like they are generating ideal private keys...but what if they've even compromised their generation...OR WORSE, they have pre-generated private keys, they are just feeding you. Keys they can later just clean out.
@_date: 2013-11-18 20:33:45
They keep saying they can adapt. BULLSQUAT. They are scared.

bare bones doesn't mean 'open source', it means 'without fat'
why would the code have jpegs, etc? its too important a piece of code to have all that fluff.
@_date: 2013-11-06 16:16:10
Yeah. It'll throw you. But Bitstamp to most in the USA is the 'real' price. Mt Gox is just some weird oddity that confuses us.

Great. Get rid of them now. Remove the jpegs, ads, remove the test codes, remove the addresses, remove the languages, all the extras...we need bare bones, that any schmoe can read. every line of code in this important piece of software is a potential problem...if it ain't needed goodbye...if that's being silly...well whatever...i guess you do sha-256 on your abacus.

AGREEEED!!!! I would even embrace 3 factor authentication, of 20 factor authentication on certain wallets. Some of my wallets are hoarding/savings...i don't want to touch them. I want protection. This is a big nervous/fear factor for new users.
@_date: 2013-11-08 02:37:08
That's not a solution to the problem, that IS THE PROBLEM I'm talking about. There is a loophole in your solution that could be EXPLOITED so big, especially because everyone is using it. Come on!!!

Time to use bitcoin escrow features, to do a crowdsourced superbowl commercial. The news of that alone (not even the commercial, just the crowdsourcing done by bitcoin) would freaky the world.

@_date: 2013-11-08 12:27:16
so vashtiii
lets take this a bit deeper,
with all the code in bitaddress.org,
What if bitaddress has figured out some way to make it seem like they are generating ideal private keys...but instead, they are compromising the randmoness, lowering the quality of the key...OR WORSE (and admittedly less likely), they have pre-generated private keys, they are just feeding you. Keys they can later just clean out.
What's to prevent them from making keys that are so much less random, that it becomes trivial for them to search the much smaller set?

Hi mister perfect...think about how foolish your comment is. Sure, it is user error to get cut by a saw as well, but when companies introduce safety features, those saws sell better, because we are afraid of f*ckin up. A better wallet = more customers &amp; less fear.

Thank you. Great comment. And well said. Though, when you say 100% is not possible, that's clearly not the intent here. I just want to improve "Savings" wallets.
