It's not a Steam code, it's Rockstar Social Club.
We've mirrored the download to ensure best availability for our customers, so you won't have to fight low download speed in case Rockstar is still overloaded.
You'll find that Steam also requires activation with Social Club for GTA. So finally, not much of a difference really ;)
You can add the game to your Library as a non-Steam game:

Whereever you'll get hand on GTA V, be it from us or Steam, I'm sure you will enjoy it. It's great!

Yes. GTA Online is centralized in Rockstar Social Club. It has all been unified for GTA V.

We're preparing some more stuff for Bitcoins, which we did not annouce yet. But we will not remove the support for Bitcoin anymore, it's there to stay.
And on the customer side of things, we're totally fine with both US and UK customers. Close to all our products do work in US also and Bitcoins are all the same world wide.
I think we should do something here on soon.
