But bitcoin is still in a down trend, MACD doesn’t say bullish. It’s a bull trap, moving divergence. It will go up, come back to 13k

The correction touched. It has to have candles touching not a wick

You’re right. I just like sharing my take on bitcoin whether people downvote or upvote I don’t mind. The reality is, bitcoin made a terrific bull run and I can’t wait for the next one, for now we need settle down and enjoy the publicity. Any publicity is good publicity, happy New Years to you as well, and I look forward to seeing you $1,000,000 past the finish line!

I told my dad to buy at $.33 and he still hasn’t listened 
@_date: 2017-12-26 19:43:28
You’re exactly right. I don’t mean first correction, but no matter what people will always wait for support to show. Bitcoin is way up. I love it, but I know it must return from the moon before it can go to mars again. We jumped from moon to mars, this time we go earth moon mars Saturn because fuck jupiter

No you are. Expecting bitcoin to go up after big macro news pushes down? Learn my friend, when people forget why it’s going down, and the next etf news it will go back up

We know halves have durastic effects on price. It would not make sense for bitcoin to moon until after the halve. I believe the bottom will be found in the summer 2019, and we will see a 5-6k btc by May 2020 for the halve, and a bull run to $208,000 by November 2022
@_date: 2018-11-30 03:37:26
That’s the point, bitcoin goes down until it goes up, this model is the average of the past 3 trends 
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:33:54
exactly my thoughts. I don’t know how low the capitulation wick will be, some models show $850-$1400 but I do believe the candle will close somewhere near $2,000
@_date: 2018-11-29 18:46:10
I took the avg gains bitcoin made in its last bull run, as well as the bitcoin halve date, and inserted it into a chart. We all know bitcoin goes up every few years, always after the halve. 2017 is 1 year after the halve, but the bull run lasted 2 years.  If we halve in May 2020, the bull run should last approximately 2 years, and fractal patterns avg indicate a 10,400% increase which is around $208,000 by November 2022. But it’s not 2019 yet, which means we still have nearly a year of depression left in this market.
