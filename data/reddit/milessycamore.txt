A lot of "property" is wealth itself though... its still hard to definitively say that would "bridge the gap"
Consumption, too can be "off the books" with anonymous crypto-currencies... 
I'm not saying there are no solutions to these issues... I'm simply saying that the technology is going to move faster and we shouldn't be surprised by aggressive tactics to quell Bitcoin's usage parameters... There's NO WAY a government is going to be able to re-tool itself for this without a lot of pain. Volatility would ensue and before its solved, the roads may crumble a bit...

Be that as it may... most of the time in these situations, major corporations would rather settle, and quietly move on than drag a fight out. Dorian's lawyer understands this and will sue only to provoke an amicable settlement.

Yeah, its not like he has a job or anything. I'm sure he trolls [r/bitcoin]( so that he can keep up on the crypto-currency market.
Military and intelligence operations? Psht! Fuck that noise. 
Attempting to institute a health care policy for every single American? Who needs THAT!

I think the control and power over currency is a two way street. The opportunity for corruption is there, and prevalent, of course. But if each person is his/her own bank. What's to stop the dishonesty? Does a government just "trust" that its citizens' self-reporting of income or assets for tax purposes is accurate. Especially with anonymous crypto-currency paradigms, who will pay for the streets? For the schools? for the Military?
Would YOU trust YOUR neighbor to pay for these things on the honor system? 
Tough questions to answer. Just know that the Government's control over currency and wealth shouldn't be abused but DOES have value as well.

Though I may reconsider that sentiment, it doesn't necessarily make the statement untrue
@_date: 2016-03-12 05:56:25
So the ends NEVER justify the means, in your logic? Just genuinely curious about that statement
@_date: 2016-03-12 03:07:26
Not saying I agree with Barry O, but your point that its un-American to tax people is bunk. We're a democratic republic. Its not perfect, but for the most part, we vote in representatives that represent our interests... This means you're under the tyranny of your fellow society members (as you always will be, period). The mechanism of the tyranny is what you're upset about, I think. There probably is an acceptable level of tyranny anyways... its just probably not to the level that Obama suggests.
For example: its tyrannical to lock someone up for their entire life because they've been convicted of murder. We're okay with that tyranny though because we think its best for the society at large. That's the same thing as income taxes... its tyrannical but most voters find it acceptable to have roads, schools and other things paid for this way. I know there's other ways to pay for those things but the point is that most of your neighbors don't feel oppressed enough to change that. So you're forced into it too.
Also.. America 150 years ago was a terrible place to be for most people. Bad comparison

I don't think we've abandoned ALL that was good have we?
The entire 20th century was probably the most the human species has ever accomplished. For most of that time, we were under a system that you find deplorable. How do you reconcile your ideals with these facts?
Again, not saying that I agree with the sentiments from the article, just asking your opinion how you can reconcile the macro?
There has to be a better argument than "correlation does not equal causation". 
Bitcoin and encryption are an incredible tool but, make no mistake, there has to be SOME compromise eventually or you ABSOLUTELY WILL HAVE tyranny. That's when things get really bad.
I understand taxation without representation but come on... we HAVE representation. Again, its not very good right now, I know, but we DO have it.
If you want society to change, you have to engage that society on its level... YOUR society is one that doesn't understand encryption and doesn't value privacy. You change that by continuing to convince people and voting for ALL levels of representative government that are aligned with your interest. 
In the meantime, I'd probably advise paying your legal obligations since that's what the law is. Otherwise, its more about your character than the laws itself.

The problem is that all of your examples are examples of how a business can have failed vision and miss opportunities... it doesn't really refute the point. You're basically saying that it's okay for business to miss opportunities because of the lack of insight and future planning

They're not going to fight BTC... but they will start fighting *people* who use it to hide from taxes... Which brings me to the other related point:
*Fiat currencies still have intrinsic value because the guys/gals with the lawbooks say they do*
Like it or not, the fiat currencies, like the US dollar, have intrinsic value not just because other people have "faith" that they do. The U.S. dollar is important, because the world's strongest entity, with the full force of the U.S. army, the FBI, the CIA, the NSA, and various local authorities with guns demands that you pay them in U.S. dollars. That's not faith. That's the law. And it ain't going away...
BTC will have its place but it won't debase the thing that all those guys/gals with the guns defend...
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:44:11


the lawmakers are people too... they're our LEADERS (however poor you think them to be). The value is held in the *collective* power of the largest entity in the world... the largest entity says "the US dollar matters"... so, even if you lose "faith" in the fiat... it still matters
Again, not saying BTC doesn't score huge points because its a transactional godsend... and it will definitely hold more and more wealth.


Aren't we already there?

They *can* speculate but have to hold onto a certain threshold of liquid assets in what they are trading (also have to hold a certain threshold of notes with proprietary trading, hedging with derivatives and other things). The point is, big banks COULD get into Bitcoin speculation, but would have to have liquidity in that market. Which means they probably won't be too interested until volatility levels off. They don't like to bet on assets that have charts that resemble Richter Scale measurements
@_date: 2013-12-16 23:36:13
That trade volume correlates with increased value? No way!

I agree that teachers aren't necessarily trained nowadays  to handle special needs students (especially in OP's case)... However,  I still disagree with the 95% figure... I would be willing to bet that 1/20 teachers ARE actual special needs teaching specialists and a great deal of others have decades of experience and can handle special needs students quite well (we all know that this circumstance is not *always* true, especially in certain economic locals)
@_date: 2013-10-24 18:35:45
Yes... as u/abdada has stated... ALL values are comparative figures... when there is an imbalance, people try to take advantage (see [arbitrage]( so values are based more on economic productivity than anything else... people who hold bitcoins and use them are the ones giving the currency more "value" when compared to other currencies... 
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:50:57
Then why did I use the word?... Think real hard!...
Because maybe I **DO** know what it means contextually to this conversation?
But go ahead, focus on semantics... that's a great way to win an argument on Reddit.

It isn't the same as a traditional deflationary currency... 
Yes, there should be concern over deflation BUT, the ease of transaction, coupled with the detached psychological nature of the coin should mitigate this to *some* degree. 
Much in the same way that you're more likely to make purchases when using credit or debit cards than with cash.  Its a well known psychological phenomenon
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:40:17
I don't think you're understanding the concept I'm floating out there... the constitution charges everyone in government to defend it... Part of that constitution is "the full faith and credit" of the US... We got off the gold standard and went to fiat because the *intrinsic* value of the money wasn't in reserves anymore... the money itself, with all of the force behind it, is what drives the value
@_date: 2013-10-25 18:06:45


zzzzz. zzzzz. Snoozer... you made that point twice. I apologize for insulting your sensibilities but, they're unrealistic and I wanted to paint the emotional picture with words.
I DO have an intellectual argument to make, yet you seem too butt-hurt from my name calling to see it. Again, I apologize but I'm stating, unequivocally, that, even though BTC will be around (actually, I'm not sure if IT will but SOME FORM of virtual currency will be around), the US dollar has its place because of the *intangible* reality that the full force of our leadership entities will continue to give it power. That *isn't* a true fiat currency because the *human* equity IS the intrinsic value of the currency.  That's really the same story as BTC anyways... it only has value because people use it. Since the amount of BTC is finite, it holds higher numerical values, right now.
There's nothing stopping anyone from creating BIT DOLLAR or BITE COIN or any number of equivalent crypto-currencies... absolutely nothing... BUT there is the matter of the largest entity in the world having control over currency supply controls that hand down the *intrinsic*, or *natural* value of the US dollar. Again... ANY economist will tell you the same thing. You're not smarter than them when it comes to economics. I'm simply pointing these *FACTS* out to you. 


Trust is irrelevant. This is the way things are.  Certainly, today is a better time to live in than in past, more oppressive times, yet I think the systems that use violence to enforce are the ones that win out in the end. Why do you think humans fight wars? Because it *doesn't* work? Or because it *does* work...

Its also very *normal* for those who don't pay armies of lawyers for "tax evasion risk assessment" to end up with steep penalties and/or prison time.
Comparing yourself to some of the most influential private entities the world has ever seen is ignoring some HUGE differences.
@_date: 2013-11-23 01:25:42
The free-flowing and lighting-fast trade-ability is the characteristic that makes BTC not *as* susceptible to deflationary spirals (due to people trying to hold the currency, knowing it will increase in value).
Its a similar concept behind why people are more willing to spend on credit (if they have any available) vs. cash. Seeing the physical currency leave your hand has a different emotional impact than if you have access to larger purchases through quick "swipe" of the card. 
This is why its actually a lot harder to responsibly pay down your Credit Card balances every month than it was to accumulate the balance in the first place.
TL;DR - Bitcoins can be spent easily with less psychological impact than traditional currencies can.
@_date: 2013-10-25 16:48:55


What a moronic statement. Of *course* there is a "such thing" as intrinsic value.
**Intrinsic Value**


I would argue that, because the currency is, not only validated, but ENFORCEABLE by the largest entity in the world, the money itself HAS intrinsic value. Any economist, who isn't totally insane, would tell you the same.

Having 2 parents whom are both teachers, I couldn't disagree more. Of all the 100's of teachers I have meet through both my own schooling and my parents over the years, I will say that horrible, incompetent, nutty teachers are NOT the norm, they are the minority. Sure, we would like to have a 100% rate of awesome educators, BUT, that's not gonna happen. 


What an outrageous thing to say. Patently false. I would be surprised if there was ANY subset of our society that had an only 1% normalcy rate (besides the obvious things like medical conditions and such)

Anarchist eh? Well then you're not only insane, you're dangerous... 


Have fun trying to use bitcoin to buy cigarettes in federal prison for tax evasion... You're the worse type of passive-aggressive anarchist.
