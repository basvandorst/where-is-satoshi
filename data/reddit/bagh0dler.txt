It amazes me how naive and ignorant people can be yet so quick to criticize and judge someone. There are a ton of factors you aren't seeing. Who is his audience, why was he brought on, how much information cost is there, and how do you inform with such a short amount of time. Mike Novogratz has done more to promote, inform, and help others adopt crypto than probably most people here in this reddit including you. He's indirectly helped ALL of us holding crypto to make more money. Sounds like you are the one with no clue. If you have ever been to a conference where he has spoke you probably wouldn't be throwing shade at him.

I totally believe you man! I myself am a crypto enthusiast but don't have any background in programming or coding so I really appreciate people who can shed light from a different perspective. We should all try to keep it civil tho, that's all.

Reminds me of that guy who took out a 20,000 student loan and put it all one bitcoin when it was $800. Someone has the thread screenshot I'm sure.

Paternalism isn't really a big thing in the US.

I got into crypto so I could buy a sweet car. Now that I have enough I can't get myself to pull the trigger for fear of what my portfolio might be worth in 5 years. I struggle trying to decide.
