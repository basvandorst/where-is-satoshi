The transaction time problem has effectively been solved in a merchant services context by companies such add BitPOS, Bitpay, Coinbase etc..
@_date: 2014-05-01 01:47:35


It seems like i've not been very clear in my initial point
* Government makes it difficult for domestic exchanges to operate because of an unfavourable tax conditions
* The easiest method for new entrants to enter the Bitcoin economy is to purchase on an exchange
* The domestic exchanges offer prices that are not competitive to international exchanges
* the new entrant to the market baulks and decides not to participate because the cost of entry is too high, ie Domestic exchange prices are too high and the cost of a telegraphic transfer to purchase from an international exchange (that doesnt bear the same hypothetical unfavourable tax treatment) is too high
My point is, that while government may not be able to stop or prevent bitcoin from happening, it is important to mainstream adoption and growth.

No secret 'round these parts that I'm working on a Bitcoin Merchant services company, [BitPOS](   We've been pretty successful thus far with what we're doing

Ah, thanks for the clarification. :-)
There is another problem that is associated: the expansion and contraction of money supply.  
That statement is really just a headline, the devil of course is in the details.  Do we increase the current 25 coins per block? or do we increase the run length of the 21m coins?  
Bottom line is that once you take the decision making away from the protocol and put it into peoples hands, Bitcoin becomes less honest.  People have their own biases, personal preferences and are subject to corruption or coercion.

If you keep BTC -&gt; BTC transactions this is true.  The minute you involve Aussie dollars the game changes.  There are a couple of interpretations of s10 of the AML/CTF act of 2006 that may be applied.

There are a couple of possibilities i reckon:
* the bank(s) are being proactive in the absence of regulation, that is, if Bitcoins regulatory legitimacy is unknown, it makes sense not to deal with it
* There is a potential reputational risk to the bank given the negative press of the likes of The Silk Road and Mt Gox. 
* The banking industry sees a threat to its existing business model and does not want to support that threat

Jason from BitPOS here.  I think we do a pretty good job in general with our payment processing, and its unfortunate you've had a bad experience.
The merchant in question is sitting in a wifi jungle.  there are so many signals bouncing around that concrete corner, its very difficult to make wifi work effectively.  As a payment processor, this is obviously out of our control.
Having said that, a while ago, i spent about half a day on a solution which is now in place and working.
Whenever i want to show off the BitPOS system to people I have meetings with, i go there and buy them a coffee / lunch.  Mostly, people who've not seen it before are pretty impressed at the way it works.
If you've not been to one of the sydney meetups, i encourage you to come along and see our system in action when there are lots of people using it..
come and talk to me about your experience, and if there is something we can do better, we'll discuss that.

There are however plenty of other regulation that you as a business may be subject to the corporations act of 2001 (ie do you provide a service where you are storing bitcoins?).

I dont necessarily agree with this view.  Governments are actually extremely important to the use / adoption of Bitcoin.
As it stands now there are gateways into the Bitcoin economy.  Any kind of onerous restriction to these gateways will stifle adoption.  
If you want to purchase bitcoin in Australia, consider the implication of unfavourable tax treatment of domestic exchanges (including operators of Lamassu (and the like) machines).  Sure, you can send money to an international exchange, but who wants to pay an AUD$35 telegraphic transfer fee, just to buy a couple of hundred in BTC so you can buy a beer or a $6 shirt?
What we're talking about is the stifling of growth and adoption, not the elimination.  
With favourable government treatment bitcoin will grow and flourish bringing investment dollars and innovation into Australia that would otherwise go elsewhere.

To expand on your point, According to the ATO's *interpretation* of the GST act bitcoin does not fit the definition of money.
There are quite a few people around the place that disagree with that, not only bitcoiners, but accountants and lawyers alike.
I dont think its fair to say blame the politicians in this case.  Bitcoin has only risen to prominence in the past 12-18 months or so.  
The process to change legislation is (mostly) a multi year process, and if we want the law changed, we, the people, have to act on that.  There hasnt been any real movement in Australia to facilitate that.
Given how novel the concept of [b|B]itcoin is, i do think it's reasonable to say "square peg, round hole", much like the legislative framework of the early 80's with regard to computer crime.

If, when you round things, you don't account for them, at the end of the day your books will be out.  It doesn't matter by how much, it just matters they are.
In any accounting system, if your books are out, even by a small amount it may be because of a simple bug, or a more systemic issue.  These issues have to be resolved 100% otherwise you'll never know if your systems are reconcilable and never know if you're leaking funds somewhere.
Not saying it cant be done, I'm saying its not just simply a matter of eating 1.4c.

This is quite an interesting point.  On one hand you're laundering your coins to avoid traceability, on the other hand you're protecting your privacy, and there are plenty of reasons to do that.

I realise you've made a throw away comment, so for anyone wondering about the practical application of changing the law:
Its a difficult problem to solve in practise.  The GST act is administered federally, but none of its output goes to the federal government.
For the GST act to be amended requires consent from all 8 states and territories.
Legislative change is hard at the best of times.  GST change is even harder.

What this amounts to, consensus or not is the arbitrary destruction of coins.  There are a couple of major implications here:
* Bitcoin becomes political.  Who is to decide what is right or wrong?  You say genocidal maniac, he says freedom fighter fighting for what is rightfully his.  Who are the arbiters, and why? why choose miners? how are they qualified to make decisions based on social / political agendas?
* Trust.  The entire premise of Bitcoin is based on its durability.  You cant counterfeit Bitcoin, the double spend problem is (in most practical terms) solved, and you cant arbitrarily decide to create or destroy coins.   If we, the Bitcoin community decide its in our power to destroy coins, trust goes away and politics rules.
Its bad in every way to mess with the destruction of Bitcoins as suggested.

The most popular way to achieve this, at least at the moment is to use a merchant services provider.

In Matthews opinion, business like Coinjar (or BitPOS, my company) will only be taxed if they sell their coins within Australia.
In the case coins are bought and sold on an overseas exchange, GST will not apply (again, in Matthews opinion)
@_date: 2014-02-10 19:26:12
You're right about the bank thing.  They're required to report on transactions over 10k.  The whole idea behind this (i believe) is to guard against money laundering and CTF.
Another option would be to exempt BTC from this reporting requirement as there is no practical way to police it.  OTOH this regulation has some real world and practical benefit, perhaps reassessing the method to cover AML/CTF needs to happen.  
If there is ever a transition to a significant % of the economy to BTC, lots of this stuff becomes difficult and impractical to enforce.

Why would you pay with Bitcoin?  There are a few really good reasons:
* its easy, really, really easy.  Hold up your phone, scan a code and your transaction is done in a matter of seconds
* you have a complete record of every transaction you've ever made, on your phone!  You dont need to log in to internet banking, its there.
* your balance is known to you at all times.  its right there on your phone, you dont need to log in to anything, you just look at the widget on your wallet.
* for better or worse, its your money, there is no credit involved and no need for you to dread the credit card bill at the end of the month.
In addition to this, have you bought anything online with bitcoin? man, its **so** easy, much better than buggerising about with your credit card, security number, name on the card, expiry etc.  point your phone at the QR code et voila, your payment has been made, just like that (insert click of your fingers here).

Perhaps I've misunderstood something.
You said "whereby the bitcoins held in the Silk Road accounts could be set to 0".  I've taken this to be destruction of bitcoins
I've counted with "Its bad in every way to mess with the destruction of Bitcoins as suggested." Meaning, i believe that in no way should there be a destruction process built in to the Bitcoin protocol.
You then said "Something should be done to deal with this weakness." Which I understood to mean that you believe there *should* be a destruction process built into the protocol.
My apologies if i've misunderstood!

I had a bit of a brainstorm with some good legal minds here in Sydney regarding the options for Australia.  Unfortunately most of the options are generally multi year and quite expensive.
Option 1: is to look to the courts for declarative relieve.  There is a similar case in [Travelex](
Option 2: Legislative reform
There are various other options including continued lobbying of the ATO, however given the extensive consultation that has been done by the ATO, the general feeling is they would not reverse their opinion at this stage.
The Bitcoin Association of Australia is currently looking for donations and grants to raise funding to pursue this (either options 1 and 2 above).
If you're not a member of the BAA, please consider joining via the [Bitcoin Foundation](  If you'd like to make a donation, you can get in touch with me directly, or via our website [bitcoin.asn.au](

What regulation / considerations need to be made regarding the payment network which is also bitcoin (as opposed to the currency functionality)
@_date: 2014-03-16 01:01:41
I'd like to add to this discussion.
* There has been *no* public ruling by the ATO specifically regarding cryptocurrency or Bitcoin.
* There was no government official at the barcamp yesterday claiming that GST was applicable.  The speaker in question was Matthew Gridland from DLA Piper.  Link [
* Matthew was very careful to preface most of what he said with "In my opinion"
* According to Matthews opinion, sourcing funds from out of Australia will not attract GST.
I was there, AMA.
**Edit:**  Everything that Matthew talked about yesterday was regarding how Bitcoin will be classified according to the GST act, that is, is it money.  If the ATO decides that for the purposes of GST Bitcoin is money, the GST will not apply according to what Matthew said.
Right now there has been no clarification as to whether bitcoin is classified as such, however in Matthews opinion, using the current GST act, it may not be classified as money, but as a 'supply' according to the GST act.

I just realised I never replied to your second question.
There is precedent here.  You have access to your debit/credit accounts from overseas and withdraw funds in excess of 10k.
Given your coins are accessible irrespective of borders, it would seem as tho' this may not be the case.  Having said that, the requirement is to declare 10k in cash, and bitcoin can be used like cash.

It is flawed thinking from our perspective, and I agree with you.  
The ATO did consult industry experts, legal experts and have been educated about bitcoin in technical, social and philosophical contexts.  There is nothing the ATO doesnt know about bitcoin.
The one thing that will make a big difference to the ATO is adoption, the more people are using bitcoin, the more popular it will be and the more the regulators and legislators will have to take notice.

PushstartAU founder John Haining was at Australia’s first Bitcoin Barcamp held in Sydney over the weekend. Here’s what he thought.
 
"Bitcoin is not money under Australian tax law," said tax lawyer Matthew Cridland of DLA Piper.
 
A crowd of 130 developers, entrepreneurs, financial tech innovators and information security experts bristled at Cridland’s words at the recent Bitcoin Barcamp at the ATP Innovations* National Innovation Centre in Sydney.
 
Cridland was a presenter at the first Australian ‘unconference’ on the cryptocurrency that addressed topics from bitcoin 101, how to keep your bitcoin safe (with concerns about exchanges like MtGox as well as operating system and USB security dominating the discussion), through to the future of digital currencies and the bitcoin improvement proposal, as well as what regulatory and consumer changes would be needed for broad adoption of digital cryptocurrencies.
 
There was optimism about bitcoins as a future for exchange evident throughout the discussions. Attendees pointed out the failings of traditional currency, the limited guarantees for Australian bank deposits, and expressed surprise at how the uninitiated reacted to the novelty of cryptocurrencies. Advantages such as near real-time transactions, the security of the bitchain and the intellectual elegance of the approach were listed as success factors.
 
Hanging in the Bitcoin Lounge
 
In the Bitcoin Lounge, attendees were able to get more hands on. The lounge played host to leading Australian innovators and startups who are helping to make bitcoin a reality. The lounge featured over five bitcoin-based businesses. Coinjar, a Blackbird Ventures-backed digital wallet and exchange startup from Melbourne with over 20,000 users, let attendees create a new wallet with $20. (I received 0.0272 bitcoins from CoinJar, which have gone down in value at the time of writing!)
 
Attendees also had the chance to wave goodbye to Australian currency and buy bitcoins in as little as 15 seconds using one of the first Lamassu bitcoin converters in Australia.
 
BitPOS, which allows vendors to easily accept bitcoins, provided payment services for the day, including the end-of-day networking session, Bitcoin Beers.
 
For those wanting to speculate in bitcoins, both CoinArch and BitTrade Australia were on hand to explain their approach to the opportunity.
 
Where were the banks?
 
With all of the financial innovation in the space, there was limited participation from existing financial players. Only a handful of attendees came from Australian banks, with one Macquarie Bank employee admitting to being there in a personal capacity, and not knowing if Macquarie Bank was doing anything in relation to cryptocurrencies.
 
The day culminated in a pitchfest from the various startup companies, assessed by finance tech experts Opher Yom-Tov (formerly of Westpac) and Kim Heras, general partner in fund 25Fifteen.
 
That more than 100 people turned out on a sunny Sydney Saturday to talk and learn about a niche topic is probably the most remarkable outcome of the day. Other innovations, such as education technology, wearables, and the internet of things also have strong interest, but nowhere near this level of committed participation.
 
As the day drew to a close, the words of the tax lawyer hung over the room. Bitcoin may not yet be legal tender in Australian – at best they are a tradable bundle of rights** – but if the enthusiastic entrepreneurs at the Bitcoin Barcamp have their way, that day may not be too far away.
 
 
* I am a director of ATP Innovations.
 
** Australian tax law is a funny thing: You (or your business) may be liable to GST, income tax or capital gains tax on bitcoin transactions. They may not be money, but they may cost you money. Get professional advice!
 
John Haining is a co-founder of PushStart, a startup community company, a director of ATP Innovations, Australia's leading business incubator.

I probably wasnt as clear as i could have been.  From a consumer perspective, as soon as the transaction says its complete, within seconds in my own experience, its done.
For an RBF transaction to be in a similar state, one has to wait for the transaction to be included in a block.  
The UX is completely different.
@_date: 2016-01-18 21:55:36
Zero conf works.  Whether or not it is perfectly secure is beside the point.
Hundreds of thousands of transactions have been conducted using zero conf, to say that anyone has lost anything doesnt really mean much IMO.
As with anything, there are levels of risk one will assume given any particular situation.  
In a peer to peer context, if you're selling something for bitcoin you can elect to wait for confirmations, or not, depending on the level of risk you're comfortable with.
Payment processors (disclaimer: I'm a co-founder of [BitPOS]( build systems and business processes around limiting and mitigating risk.
I'm also against RBF as it has the potential to completely destroy the retail market.  If the RBF flag has been set on a transaction, a payment processor there are two options:
* Reject the transaction
* Push the risk to the merchant
Irrespective of the the reason for the RBF flag to be set (accidental/otherwise) there is a high potential for a terrible UX for either the merchant or the customer.
Online transactions are exactly the same, who wants to wait for a conformation for any transaction, (especially time sensitive transactions like ticket sales), when you can use a credit card and have your purchase confirmed instantly.
I'm absolutely not against change in the bitcoin protocol at all, and welcome solutions and implementations that can mitigate perceived/actual risks.

I've just gone and had a look at a couple of random block explorers, and can only see txid   Your customer is either trying to scam you, or the wallet is broken.
Txid  you can go and look at anywhere and you'll see it on the network.  Anything to do with this transaction should be honoured.
Txid  if this is indeed a transaction that your customer has attempted to legitimately execute, you can prove to him, (and even have him prove it to himself) by asking him to look it up on any block explorer other than blockchain.info.
You're not on the hook for this, and it's easily provable.

AML/KYC as you put it is no real impediment. People scream, but honestly it's just no big deal, you go thru an identity process, that's it.

I hear what your saying, and agree that scepticism can be healthy and even required, especially in this case.
For better or worse, there are very few people on this planet who can comment with any authority on the actual state quantum computing. We, as the Bitcoin community, have to consume the information available and make the best decisions we can.
It certainly seems that QC is coming and will be a credible threat to cryptography in the next few years (if not already in some government basement somewhere), and it would be remiss, nee irresponsible of us not to research, form opinions and develop contingencies on what appears will be a credible threat in the future.
Voicing your opinion to influence direction is part of that.  Just because you, I or anyone elses opinions don't make it into the final codebase doesnt make whatever final decisions wrong, just different to what was desired.  If we feel strongly enough about that, we simply move on.  No one is forcing us to continue.
@_date: 2016-02-08 21:14:28
In the face of QC, it's not only you affected.  You are free to store your value in another storage medium, it doesn't have to be Bitcoin.
As with everything making Bitcoin QC resistant is a trade off between making everyone happy and the longevity of the system.

This sounds pretty cool at first glance, however I have to agree with [analysis.
If this system gained critical mass, its just a matter of time before someone can create a chirp with the details of that payment and swap out the address.  If you're in a high volume or noisy environment who is going to notice a few extra chirps?
As a developer of a bitcoin POS system myself, the last thing a merchant wants to do is look at someones phone, or have the customer check the POS screen to verify the transaction.  From my experience and testing, there is a high probability that someone will not check the address correctly, leading to funds being stolen.
lastly, the idea the transaction is sent in the clear is astonishing!  it would be irresponsible for you to push this out for public consumption as it is.

One of the problems with accepting bitcoin in an enterprise environment (or any corporate environment for that matter) is one of security.
Since bitcoin is just like cash, any unscrupulous executive / accounts pay/receivable clerk can just up and vanish with the cash.
When multi-sig transactions become popular and enterprise software can do accounting in bitcoin is when we'll start to see the adoption of Bitcoin in larger businesses.

When I first heard about Bitcoin I thought exactly this.  Then I started using it and realised it doesn't matter. hundreds of thousands of Bitcoins are/will be transferred using this method, and as wallet software matures, it's only going to get easier.
How do people transfer coins to each other now? We either email our SMS an address, or if we're buying something use a QR code or NFC.
Would having a DNS system make it easier ? Possibly, but it comes with its own set of problems

Transactions can be settled instantly, and we do it at BitPOS, and assume the double spend risk. When i say instantly, i mean we actually wait for the transaction to hit the network and do zero conf transactions.  
For higher ticket items where a double spend is actually worthwhile, the time it takes to have a couple of confirmations under your belt may be a problem.

In a retail setting having a customer wait around for 40 mins is a pretty bad experience for all involved.  The customer (generally) wants to purchase their item and move on.
Some say this is analogous to an approval process for finance, however I dont buy into that.  The customer *knows* they have the money and *knows* they're good for it and just wants to leave.
On the merchant side, they *dont* know the customer wont perform a double spend attack.  
There are, thankfully, ways to work around this.
@_date: 2013-09-02 02:59:44
FWIW, i agree with this.  Traditional payment mechanisms have had an eternity to mature and work out the kinks and bugs.  
There isn't enough infrastructure, experience, or money at the moment that will allow a large company with a massive turnover to operate with the same level of efficiency as with traditional payment methods.
Dont get me wrong here, i think it will be fantastic when it comes to fruition, its just that, right now, we need to (collectively, as the bitcoin community) build out our experience so we can bring large scale services to market.
@_date: 2013-11-11 07:53:50
If we want bitcoin to be mainstream, I would say that Bitcoin is not ready for the security the average joe requires.
@_date: 2013-10-11 21:20:16
This is an interesting idea.  IIRC coffee shops mostly take cash as its difficult to deal with banks and the traditional PIN systems.  
There is also an opportunity for the sex toy shops around the RLD (who have the same problem) to add additional payment methods.  BTC isn't really subject to fraud like plastic cards issued by the banks.
Accepting bitcoin directly, or via a BTC payment provider also creates a good opportunity for them not to keep cash on premises.

At the risk of hijacking the thread, i lived in NL for a few years, and now in .com.au.  I believe they have the right approach to this.  
We whinge and moan about alcohol fuelled violence here in Australia when really, if we legalised marijuana, or took a more opened minded approach to it i really believe our problems with alcohol would go down.

It really takes a lot of time and effort to organise things when you're dealing with people from all over Australia, not to mention the international community.
It really is a credit to the current team that we've come so far, built something from nothing and are internationally recognised. I am humbled by the level of professionalism and experience of the team.

As one of the organisers of Sydneys Beer for Bitcoins event, I've had to deal with loads of people who are brand new to bitcoin.
A lot of these people just cant grok the idea they have money on their phone.  When i say i'll gift them the equiv. of a few dollars to demo how it works, the penny doesnt immediately drop as to it being real money they can spend (albeit in a limited way right now).
We all know how physical fiat is minted and printed, but (most of us) dont really know the economic rationale behind the money supply.  We _all_ know how to spend and use fiat in its various different forms (credit, physical, debit etc).  
Likewise with bitcoin, i think we've gone past the 'extreme early adopter stage' and are getting to the point where people dont really care how bitcoins are created, they just want to know how to use it.  
I think mining and usage are now two distinct topics and in this case should probably be kept separate.

sort of:
For taxation purposes, that is, for calculating taxation liability, the Australian Taxation Office (ATO) treats one Bartercard Trade Dollar as if it were one dollar in legal currency. It also treats other, similar, "barter credits" - for example, EBanc, Contrabart - as if each "barter credit" were one dollar in legal Australian currency. The revenue authorities of the Australian States treat "barter credit" in the same way.

To drive bitcoin adoption further into the mainstream I think the key is turning the bitcoin economy into a transaction economy, that is, buying stuff with your coins.

As someone who just signed up with bit pay, the processes was trivial. I had to wait a couple of days for the approval processes to complete (my domain is even parked ATM), but in the end, there was nothing onerous, that couldn't be completed in just a few mins given I had my domain already purchased.
Also I'm technical and have built my own cart, so it's not as if I really needed to, I just wanted to explore the process and learn a little more so I can advise others who aren't so technical down the track..
@_date: 2013-12-10 19:24:07
Founder of BitPOS here.  We've had pretty good success with The Old Fitzroy Hotel using only a tablet.
The solution is not perfect as they have an existing POS machine, however the bar staff have been trained using our keypad and have no trouble with it.   The bar has a special "bitcoin" payment button on the existing POS terminal which they press, then use BitPOS to capture the payment.
Probably the best evidence for this to us was one of the bar staff saying "I thought it would be easy, but I didn't think it would be *this* easy".
We've put a lot of effort in to our design to make the interface as easy to use and simple as possible.  You may have seen us in the international media eg: [on the BBC]( and [Al Jazerea](

@_date: 2013-07-03 00:14:11
Not OP, but my take on it ATM, is that there is little economic knowledge required to get into bitcoin.  The knowledge built up by people like, say myself, and perhaps OP is a side effect of being interested in using an alternate payment system.
OTOH, right now, (IMO) is early adopter time.  Its not particularly easy to get bitcoins if dont have the contacts to trade with (going down to the bank to deposit cash while easy, is a real PITA), so it takes certain ties to the community to overcome some of the inertia.
OT/O/H, While all the technology involved right now is easy for us early adopters, the simple concept of electronic wallets, wallets in the clouds, QR codes, and the BTC infrastructure in general is a major hurdle for many people to overcome.
Speaking from an Australian perspective btw.
@_date: 2013-10-25 21:22:12
I think its pretty disingenuous of you to use the words "stupid people" with wanting to promote bitcoin.  While the world is a diverse place and people have different levels of intelligence this

Agreed. nothing had happened today that indicates that bitcoin itself is flawed. I can still transfer coins to whoever I want with no technical impediment.
Tbh, I think what happened overnight (Aussie time) was a good thing. Its given the community as a whole a good deal of experience, it's given the exchanges experience an economics lesson.
Exchanges will cater, we may not panic, and ways of dissemination of ddos events will proliferate. 
The entire community just matured a little. Good lesson.

The Fitz is a great place, its just not as central a location as the GPO bar.  
The GPO bar is the best and easiest place to get to for pretty much everyone.  its in the CBD, its close to Wynyard and Martin Place stations, not to mention there are lots of people who work in the city.

@_date: 2013-07-26 01:55:07
Depends on what you mean by support.  You can support bitcoin by:
* talking to people about benefits, questions like "do you accept bitcoin?"
* be a miner to support the network, or support a mining company by purchasing shares
* create a local awareness/action group and get like minded people in a room to talk about bitcoin
* talk with your local regulators and educate them
It depends on how action minded you are, your contacts and you desire and determination to be a part of the community.  I'm one of the originating founders of the Bitcoin Sydney group and would be happy to help you out with ideas, actions to get you going!

You know, I agree with the people who say its very early on in the bitcoin game to make a bitcoin only store.
Having said that, if its a hobby, and you're not expecting to derive huge revenues, and it doesnt cost you more than you can afford, then go ahead and leave it as bitcoin only.
I've done something similar with  which I've setup as a showcase for how damn easy it is perform a bitcoin transaction.  Sales are very slow, but the site doesnt cost me anything to have there.  I also like to think my customer service is not bad.. :-)
Admittedly your site is a bit more complex than mine as i only have one product for sale, but at the end of the day, the longer you're around, the more consistently great your customer service is, the more the word will spread about you being the go-to guy to get outdoor equipment. 
think of it as a long term investment.

functionally no different from printing out a QR code with your private key on a bit of paper.

TBH, i dont know, i got it delivered to work and wasnt at my desk when it showed up.  
its got a Deutsche Post postmark on it, so  I suspect it was just via regular aussie post. 
I'm pretty impressed with the quality of these things.  The feel nice in your hand, slightly thicker than a credit card.  I could scan both QR codes on the front without a problem with my HTC One X.
The hologram looks secure, and it appears as tho' its got some, uh, not sure of the right jargon here, but cuts in it, so if you peel it off, it will leave little bits behind, much like the "VOID" that appears if you remove a compliance sticker from an aussie motorbike helmet.

TBH, I'm probably going to either use these as gift cards or pressies for friends.  I share your concern, and my counter is the reputation of bit-card.de will be irrevocably damaged to the point of them going out of business if they did keep the private keys and were hacked, or absconded themselves.
this of course assumes they actually want to stay in business.
At the end of the day, unless you print this stuff yourself, there has to be a degree of trust somewhere.

what exactly are you after?
@_date: 2013-10-11 22:26:44
It seems to me that the theme most of the naysayers go through is something along the lines of "bitcoin cant work because its not equal in every way to traditional currency".
This is a pretty short sighted view in my opinion.  Traditional currency has been around for hundreds of years, time enough for infrastructure to be built out.  In this time, entire generations have been born and died into traditional currency societies.  The knowledge and experience of each of these generations has been compounded to where we are now.
We (the bitcoin community) are in the process of rolling out new infrastructure, gaining experience in what works and what doesnt, and educating the world on the merits and benefits of what bitcoin heralds over traditional currency.
Suggesting bitcoin will fail because its not an all pervasive and mature as traditional currency is not a valid argument.

the cost of becoming a bank in Australia and getting a banking licence and everything that goes with it has lifted the bar so high there will likely never be another competitive bank in the australian landscape at all.
There no real secret sauce in doing AML/KYC per se, no mysterious Vodo magic or anything.  For the AML part, grab your transactions, look up the source/destination in your watchlist and report.
The difficulty in all this is managing a critical system that sits in the SWIFT stream (if you're doing a international payments) and making sure everything is working *fast* so as not to slow down (or halt!) the stream too much.
people go on about how evil and bad AML/KYC is which i think stems from a whole lot of misinformation.  Personally, i dont want Bag Guys getting funds to do Bad Things (tm).

That thankfully is a simple fix by making the QR code larger.. :-)
I'm happy to say that everyone who intended to buy beer with bitcoins eventually did, even if it was by proxy of giving someone with a higher res camera payment in kind.. :-)

There is something screwy with your password verification rules.  I've entered in a password that contains upper, lower and special chars and it failed the check. 
When i attempted to engineer a password that i could post to you, it (the engineered password) succeeded.
Now i've got an account, when i attempted to change my engineered password to the one that didnt initially work, i got no message saying it has been successfully changed, or that it failed, but when i went to log out and log back in again, i had to use the engineered password.
You can find my account on your system pretty easily, the LHS of my email address is the same as my reddit username.

You're looking at a lot of negative points and forgetting the positives to come out of the US.
* [a texas court declares bitcoin money](
*  [FinCen guidelines expanded to include cryptocurrency]( 
* [bloomberg testing a bitcoin ticker](
These are just US based points as well;  there are plenty of positive stories from all over the world:
* [Germany says bitcoin is private money](
* [Bitcoin meet in argentina has &gt; 180 ppl]( 
* [The first ever pub in australia is to start accepting bitcoin]( - DISCLAIMER, I'm one of the organisers
* [the reserve bank of india not to regulate bitcoin, yet](

Is my motivation purely the good of bitcoin? There definitely is a rather large portion of altruism about what I do. At the time, there didn't seem to be anyone in the Sydney area who was already doing a Sydney meetup, so i put my hand up..  
BitcoinSYD is a great meetup where I've met lots of really cool, smart and talented people. We've also had new faces every single week we've been going (for three months now!).  I love talking to everyone from "mums and dads", to VC's, Angels, speculators, traders, miners and people who just want to be a part of something that will change the world.
I like the idea that my contributions to the community seem to make a difference, its something i get a real kick out of.

@_date: 2013-08-18 03:05:43
I respectfully disagree.  
What you've just cited is the difference between black letter and common law, or rather what is in the spirit of the law.
I would argue that miners in fact do create units of currency.  The presiding law official is the person who judges the arguments presented based on their interpretation of the law.
Edit:  The law always has to be interpreted to some degree.  Its almost impossible to create blanket statements that are irrefutable based on generic circumstances.

@_date: 2013-12-30 22:44:55
My kids are 12 and 13.  They love the idea of BTC because its what i live and breath on a daily basis.
My kids dont really have a full grasp of the value of money.  They get these shiny blue/red/yellow tokens (I'm in Australia, our money is pretty), and they dont really have to work too much for it (please lets not get in to a work ethics debate). 
They know understand spending/buying power of their yellow token ($50), but didnt really understand what investing was until they wanted to buy some bitcoins.
I did my very best to be impartial about my expln of what investing is, and they should only invest what they can afford to lose.  From their initial offering to buy $50 worth of BTC they it to $10, their reasoning being if they lost $10, it wouldnt be as bad as losing $50.
So, i guess my point is I've not educated my kids on the technical nature of Bitcoin because they wont really understand any of the technical aspects of it.
My education is based around high level concepts of buying/spending/investment.  If they show an aptitude for knowing the technical details, i'll happily explain them, but at this stage, talking about math, hashing, double spend will just go in one ear and out the other.

point 1, no, it would be counter productive for satoshi to watch an economy bloom, then cash out his millions of btc.  it would destroy the economy, way before he could reap the benefit (assuming the motive is not to destroy the economy).
point 2. no.  if coins are not being 'circulated' it means the value rises for everyone else.  if they truly are lost forever, it just doesnt matter. Currently we can divide BTC to 8 decimal places which means there is enough for everyone who wants to buy in.  If/When 8 is not enough, it can be divided further.

In terms of acquiring bitcoins, the reason to acquire them would affect how you want to use / create your personal kb of economics. 
If you were to acquire bitcoins in order to spend them, it doesnt really matter /too/ much if you're an economic genius or not.
If you want to take a market position on them, then i guess you'd ideally like to know about about how forex works, then apply whatever knowledge you have regarding the technology and community of bitcoin..
@_date: 2013-12-19 04:45:59
I admire your enthusiasm and wish you success.
@_date: 2013-09-12 05:08:26
I guess its a matter of timing.  If the economy gets too big, "cashing out" will crash and burn it, making satoshi's reserves useless.
Reaching a little, if satoshi were to cash out even now, he could crash and kill the economy, the reason? many people watching the addresses that have those millions of btc.  if those btc started to move, people would know, people would panic, and IMO, the economy would die.
**EDIT:** I didnt really address the question of a BTC only world.
IMO, i dont think that even in 20 years BTC will usurp traditional currency.  I think BTC will find a place of some sort of equilibrium along side the worlds various traditional currencies.  I dont think governments will outlaw btc, nor regulate it out of usefulness.  
All the signs so far are pointing in an overall positive direction, eg, AML/KYC regulation be applied, the ruling in texas of btc being money, and the ruling in germany of btc being private money.  all this points to btc being socially accepted, and taken out of the realm of the backyard hacker, and further into mainstream society.  By adding regulation you're raising the bar as to who can own and operate a btc business, which in turn adds legitimacy, and puts btc out there *further* into the mainstream.

I think you may be over-reacting.  
There is no proof anywhere that MtGox are insolvent.  In fact quite the opposite is true.  [Roger Ver]( has come out and staked his reputation on them actually *not* being insolvent.
Just because *you* cant think of a reason why they would require you to verify your account before making a withdrawal, doesnt mean they're insolvent.
In fact, the only actual conclusion you can reach from given the evidence you've provided is "they require you to verify your account before you can withdraw from it".

In the places I've worked, the AML systems sit in the international SWIFT payment stream.
Put simply, the transactions that flow through the SWIFT network are washed against watch lists.  These lists come from people like the CIA, FBI, DFAT and other organisations around the world, and contain really, really nasty people.  As i mentioned in a previous post, genocide is just another day in the office for some of these people, *i shit you not*.  Do some research on a guy called Charles Taylor ex pres of Liberia.
Now, sitting in the comfort of my warm lounge room, i can ideologically say that AML is bad, however in the cold light of day, its systems like AML screening that actually keep the world a safer place by making it more difficult for these really bad people to receive funds to commit terrible crimes.  
Personally, i'm happy for my transactions to be screened so that actual real life genocide may be more difficult to commit.
There are a couple of points I'd like to make:
* unless you're transacting fiat on the SWIFT payment network, your transactions will not be subject to AML
* just because you have money in a bank account doesnt mean you will be subject to AML
* AML really has an important place in our society (IMO) as a tool to help prevent these terrible crimes.
* bitcoin cannot be subject to AML, the paradigm between bitcoin and the current banking network is so different, it would require a change to the bitcoin protocol to enable AML on BTC-&gt;BTC transactions
* if you're moving funds in and out of BTC, then your transactions may be subject to AML
* AML is not some magic privacy invading technology.  AML is done by your bank, and kept internally to your bank.  Only when there is a match on the watchlist is a regulator involved in your transaction.  I mean, you're doing business with business, right? they need to keep records to see how much money is in your account, ie they know your information already.
* following on from above, your privacy is no more or less invaded by AML.  How do you think inter bank settlement are made?  Bank A knows money comes from account A, Bank B knows money from Bank A must go to Account B.  All AML does is look at this transaction and decide, is that person on a watch list
Regarding your opposition to taxation, I have an opposite view.  I happily pay tax as it pays for the roads i drive on, educates the children who will be the leaders when i'm old, and provides a government and infrastructure that provides law an order in the society in which i live. 
No system is perfect, and $deity knows the system in which i live has its own problems, but its ok, and works for the most part..

Australia here, I had to read that a couple of times to work out what you meant.  :-)
@_date: 2013-07-26 20:55:03
I've thought a lot about the accounting of bitcoin with current systems and have written a bitcoin POS system myself.
The way I've handled it is for the fiat amount to be entered which is converted the fly to BTC after which a QR code is generated.
All this is stored in a database, and for accounting I produce a csv of the fiat, exchange rate and BTC amount.
If the business wants to cash out there are the regular channels to do so and for accounting purposes the transactions occurred in fiat..
@_date: 2013-09-16 04:19:53
I think the idea is pretty cool, its kind of like a loyalty rewards program, except you an redeem your rewards anywhere.
The implementation is going to be interesting, as the customer will have to lodge an address with you, and probably most customers wont know what a bitcoin is.  Its a great way to educate people on the virtues of bitcoin.
The amount of the kickback should be tied to the exchange rate, and worked out in your business plan IMO.

Australia here.  Everyone shares different ideals and ideology.  We've been working hard for months on hammering out our agreement with the Bitcoin Foundation.  This is not something we've entered in to lightly.  
In fact, the complete opposite is the case, we've spent a lot of time on the finer points of our agreement making sure we think we're in the best position to move the community forward in Australia.
The Board of the Bitcoin Association of Australia is comprised of members with different ideals and ideology, and while we cant be everything to everyone, I feel as though we represent a pretty broad section of the community.
Edit: I accidentally a word
@_date: 2013-12-12 21:20:37
Thanks for being rational, really, its great to hear from all points of the community.
We do have differing views on things, and that's to be expected.  Our view is I guess pretty obvious.   Fwiw, there was a lot of debate about the best way to do things, and believe it or not, the way you've expressed your view is represented on the board.
We all want bitcoin to succeed, and there is room for everyone to play a part.  we believe or part is to add some organisation and formality, and perhaps be a recognised and trusted point where people governments and others can come to learn about bitcoin.
The foundation does indeed provide some of the heavy lifting for us, which makes sense to me from a pure logistics perspective, why duplicate stuff when you don't have to?
While we don't share the same implementation philosophy, I believe the bitcoin community at large will benefit from a variety of approaches at making it a success.

My take on this is they do actually understand Bitcoin pretty well. Remember, this is a research paper from a traditionally conservative industry, on a cutting edge topic. We can't expect a paper espousing the  merits of Bitcoin as we see them.
Having an publically available research paper from a traditionally conservative industry not bash Bitcoin, and in fact talk about it rather dispassionately is a positive step into the mainstream in my opinion.

here, have an upvote, not for being on the same side, but for being a champ.
underbelly wasnt too bad a series.. :-) (we'll always have some kind of corruption, we just need to make sure we police it)
Edit:  I just wanted to add (even tho' you most probably realise) for the record, its not just drug runners that need to launder money, its also people like this [Charles Taylor](  ).  
I've cited this in a previous post, and hinted above about humanity being better off, but these people are bad, *really*, **really** bad, as in genocide and heinous torture bad (see if you can find something to read on the fighting in Sierra Leone).  Its these people that AML/KYC hinders, sure its just one way to stop funds from going to these guys, but its a way to make funding more difficult.  this is the main reason i'm for AML/KYC compliance.
Another point of interest, charities are/were a favourite way of moving funds about the place.  A charity collects funds to do something to educate the local populace whereby education means blowing shit up and killing people so they'll change their ways.     It surprised me to find heaps of charities on watch lists.  I was so naïve.

There are two sides to this:

AML/KYC doesnt have to cost the earth, but surely can if you're a multinational organisation.  Most of these costs are taken up by expensive consultants (Cap Gem) implementing and configuring complicated IT systems.

I work in north sydney, and will organise something for the CBD. 
One of the major things for bitcoin adoption is to complete the economic circle, ie, i get paid in bitcoins, so i can buy bread and milk to feed myself.  The idea behind getting a pub/restaurant to accept bitcoin was to plant that seed.  
As yet, i've got no specific venue in mind, however [is checking his/her contact list for places that may be interested.
The guys from bitinnovate have also replied (thanks guys!) that they would come along.
I'm targeting june as the meetup time and was thinking of using meetup.com to facilitate the meeting, but am open to any reasonable suggestion.

I've been looking for something like this too, but couldnt find anything either.

The bar is so amazingly low, there is no reason for a merchant not to accept bitcoin from a merchant payment perspective.

I dont think his talk was a load of shit.  
There are a couple of takeaway for me on this:
 * People don't seem to mind if a currency is issued by a government, as long as they can trust it.  
 * Traditional currencies are being eroded by other forms of value transfer, eg Amazon coins, Nike calories, Vodafone Fakka, and washing liquid!
Good news for bitcoin, right?

Nice balanced and considered reply, thanks!
While there is the opportunity to start something new and 'see the light',  I'm not convinced it will be grabbed by both hands, or even one!  A lot of the existing paradigms dont exist with regard to taxation, distribution, and some economic policies.   
I want to use the word ignorance, not in a negative sense, but more like an unawaking, so i think the ignorance of the people who make the rules and their resistance to change or adaptation is a big hurdle to overcome.  I want to play my little part in education and adoption, and (to keep OT), IMO, AML/KYC is a part of that.  I strongly believe this type of regulation benefits humanity as a whole.
Now, a lot of people think AML/KYC is big brother watching you, and it isnt, at least not where i've been.  The KYC part simply identifying people who want to open an account with your bank sufficiently to determine they're not a Bad Guy (tm).  In Australia we use a system that requires 100 points of identification, which is the basis for KYC compliance.  
AML as mentioned is your bank making sure payments that pass thru' it, are not going to Bad Guy (tm).  its only if you're on a watch list that you're flagged.  I guess there is scope for your favourite TLA agency to manipulate the lists, but who watches the watchers?  In Australia is the ICAC i believe.
In the current climate, especially considering the NSA scandal, i can appreciate there is rife paranoia around regulation in general.  no-one wants to think they live in a police state..
I was watching the Tech Crunch interview with the winkelvii twins last night, and i think they hit the nail on the head when they say that crypto currency and fiat will co-exist.  you cant stuff the genie back into the bottle at all, and you cant fully regulate the hydra that is decentralised money.  The Bittorrent technology is a perfect example of this.
I went a bit OT there, but its nice to have a conversation with someone who isn't an extreme hater on all regulation..  :-)

@_date: 2013-08-18 00:35:54
My take on this is, while not literally creating anything, for all intents and purposes a miner is actually creating the bitcoins.  
A miner might not be technically creating the reward with their own mining kit, its the very act of mining that creates the reward that is distributed to each miner.
I realise this may be against popular opinion, and I'm not saying I agree with the FinCEN on this.  Its just my opinion. :-)

@_date: 2013-11-26 06:06:17
I respectfully disagree.
I believe we're moving toward mass adoption.  People don't need to know what a hash or blockchain is to be able to use bitcoin.  Most people dont know the economic theory that underpins traditional currency, they just want to know "can i have my bread and milk now please". 
To *want* to use bitcoin people have to have trust in the system and access to technology that will allow them to spend.  Most people don't care what a hash or blockchain is, nor should they.  All they care about is "can i have my widget now please".   Producing literature that will help that, will help drive adoption. 
OTOH, if people are speculating with large amounts of bitcoin (relative to their spending power), then learning about bitcoin and how to secure it is probably more beneficial to them.  learning some of the bitcoin jargon such as paper wallets/cold storage BIPS*nnn* etc etc will provide them with a good level of familiarisation they should.

that would mean that once you do a single spend on an address it becomes "compromised", right?  it doesn't diminish in security the more you use it.. 
I see your point that once exposed, if there is a flaw the address could be then used in an exploit.  this does seem like an extreme case tho'.

The wider bitcoin community is actually very small, and reddit is a place where people can come to get advice, and post their experiences.
What you're looking at here, using reddit, is an information concentrator.
Its a shame that you see only negatives with bitcoin and it has tainted your opinion.  
On the other hand, if you're smart enough to use the internet, you're smart enough to use google and find positive stories regarding bitcoin to balance your information.

I initially thought this might be a good idea, but on 2nd thought, i dont really like the idea for myself, mainly because its another device i'd have to carry around.
I also think there are some misleading points in his (OP's?) presentation:
* Smartphones rely on third party services, assuming you're talking about smartphone wallets, my android Bitcoin Wallet only relies on other nodes in the network.  I dont have to have my coins online with blockchain.info.  Even if i do use blockchain.info as my wallet, there are distinct advantages in that as well, ie, if i want to spend my coins, i dont have to have my phone.
* If i'm a consumer, having a smartphone to conduct transactions with is *great*.  its so damn easy to scan a QR code.
* transactions are not anonymous, they're pseudo-anonymous.  anyone can track the coins into the address by the wallet.. 
* The presenter mentioned that if you lose your phone on the way home and need money for the bus, you're SOL, that applies directly to this device as well!
I can see a useful application in a retail environment if you dont want your staff carrying around a tablet, altho' at the price point mentioned ($100), a cheap tablet can do everything this device does.
Also, at the end of the pres one of the other people on the call mentions the security of an address diminishes the more you use it.  I cant fathom how that could possibly be true.  The anonymity may decrease somewhat, but the security? nope.

You may as well give a link to the entire act for context: [CURRENCY ACT 1965](
My interpretation of this section of the act means that if you have anything *like* money that may be issued by someone else other than Australia must follow the same rules as Australian money.
Ipso facto, this section does not define money.
**Other Highlights:** 
**Section 11(1)** Every payment that is made shall, unless it is made according to the currency of some country other than Australia, be made according to the currency of Australia provided for by this Act.
**Part IV—Legal tender 16  Legal tender (1)** A tender of payment of money is a legal tender if it is made in coins that are made and issued under this Act and are of current weight.
**Part VI—Miscellaneous 22  Prohibition of other than official coins** A person shall not make or issue a piece of gold, silver, copper, nickel, bronze or of any other material, whether metal or otherwise, of any value, other than a coin made or issued under the repealed Acts or under this Act or a British coin as defined by the repealed Acts, as a token for money or as purporting that the holder is entitled to demand any value denoted on it.
Penalty:  One hundred dollars.

The only way to really get anonymous coins is by mining them.  Unfortunately that doesn't seem like it well work for you.
Alternately you can earn them (by working for them) and use a laundry service to transfer then to a paper wallet.
@_date: 2013-07-17 00:10:25
while those who have orders share your frustration, this is just a sensationalist headline grabbing statement.
if i was to think of just two other things that are detrimental to the public perception of bitcoin, i would think of using bitcoins to buy illicit things, or to facilitate money laundering.
both of those things are things people who dont know about bitcoins hear about, BFL, is something that affects mainly bitcoiners.

We had a trial last Wednesday which was pretty successful.
The system I've developed uses zero confirmation, it literally takes seconds for the transaction to show up on the network.
the system is of course configurable, so when it comes time for bigger ticket items, the merchant can choose how many confirmations they want..

i think you've taken my remark out of context.  Any crypto currency *can* have the AML/CTF concepts applied, and IMO, this is not a bad thing.
EDIT: Having worked in the AML/KYC area before, I can say with certainty that the central banks will not know what is in each person protfolio by way of AML/KYC legislation.  AML/KYC/CTF is all about stopping money flowing to Bad Guys (tm).
