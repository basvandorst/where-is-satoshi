Money is a network backed by the collective belief of the population. Governments and laws are also a construct that is supported by collective belief. Governments fail when people lose faith and revolt. If you were from a country who witnessed hyperinflation, chances  are that you could place more faith in the Bitcoin network than your own government. As long as people have belief in the Bitcoin network, it will have value.

When I go to other crypto subreddits it's always frustrating to see how much hate bitcoin gets. I love bitcoin because it's open and the developers on the network prioritize decentralization, security, and immutability.

Throughout human history, mankind has used many different objects as money including cowry shells, gold, and silver. In prison cigarettes are often used as money. Scarcity, fungibility, durability, divisibility are some properties of money. With Bitcoin, you can store your keys in your brain and cross borders with millions. Bitcoin is permissionless, anyone can participate in the network. Supply is fixed and the network is secured and maintained by consensus. The code is open, auditable for everyone to see and scrutinize. Compare that to centralized government currencies of the world. The Roman Empire lasted 1500 years and it too had a period of hyperinflation. The US is 240 years old in comparison.
