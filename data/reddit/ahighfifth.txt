I feel similarly about litecoin. What is special about litecoin?

If u mean you are keeping funds on coinbase, definitely 100% do not do that. Google MTGOX and read the wiki of what happened on that exchange

Oh that's good. I thought they had a flat fee for BTC. Also be careful of leaving the coins on Coinbase if they amount to anything you would consider serious value. Coinbase could just steal your money at some point and there is nothing you could do about it.
Google MTGOX, that exact scenario has already happened.

I'm not sure, but the real question is what happens after all coins are mined. Who will power the network then?

I hope she isn't getting walloped with transaction fees on buying bitcoin in such small amounts!! Also I would recommend investing such small amounts in ltc or ethereum, it's a much higher upside.
