I hear that :(
@_date: 2018-01-27 15:59:22
and green again! 
@_date: 2018-05-12 08:38:44
Cause that's what Bitcoin does.
@_date: 2018-06-24 10:28:11
Time to wake up now, please.
@_date: 2018-03-30 10:55:14
seeing a lot less ctazy "HODL" posts now. Is reality finally kicking in?
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:48:58
So at what point do you define it as a "short squeeze" and not the next step into the drop to 3k?
@_date: 2018-02-09 00:44:31
If anything, it's going to head down further until next week.
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:51:16
It has been the last chance to buy at "these" prices for a few weeks now. That's a lot of last chances!
@_date: 2018-03-16 22:08:07
I always wonder about people that do this, so you eat your food with your minty fluor fresh mouth and have it taste horrible? Then eat and let it be?
@_date: 2018-02-26 13:38:13
People buying?
@_date: 2018-03-26 11:28:15
Rinse and repeat, every week.
@_date: 2018-02-20 21:33:09
10/10 for effort
@_date: 2018-02-09 01:14:56
There should be a drop that goes a little bit further in the next few hours before the rise that has happened like clockwork almost every night. So maybe buy in about 2 hours from now.
@_date: 2018-02-23 12:36:34
There they are!
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:09:54
crash, dip, Po-tay-to po-tah-to
@_date: 2018-02-21 00:58:44
It makes it more fun if you are on the right side of the crash though. I always seem to be at the wrong side when these things happen :D.
@_date: 2018-02-21 01:20:41
But they told me the earth was flat...
@_date: 2018-02-21 11:06:21
This is actually quite a clever scam! I'm sure some stupid people will fall for it at the end of the "exploit".
@_date: 2018-03-10 00:02:22
I think you guys may all have terrible guts.
