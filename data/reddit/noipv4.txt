The tech companies provide something called a 'service', which is not a physical object, but is damn well valuable. The service provided by Bitcoin is the 'Bitcoin network' and thus the btc units have value, since it allows wealth to be securely transferred from any to any without hindrance.

Switzerland: It's a god-damn tiny country. Moreover homes there are tiny and have excellent insulation.

Less than 10 million people stay in Switzerland. It's NOT an energy benchmark by any means.

7tps on chain; off-chain it will scale to 1million tps. Transferring tonnes of gold in the traditional banking system is like Bitcoin on-chain; buying a cup of coffee by swiping a credit card is off-chain.
It makes Bitcoin the savior of the masses and looks excellent for someone wanting to preserve purchasing power. 
In fact the greatest fraud that banking does is rampant inflation as well as quantitative easing, and there is nothing to safeguard the masses from these. 95% erasure in purchasing power from 1913 to 2013 is nothing but fraud.

True: 
Nouriel Roubini has been ordered by New York City to remove his hot tub — often the site of wild parties with younger models — from his Manhattan penthouse's roof, according to a New York Post report.
The economist, nicknamed 'Dr. Doom' for his forecasts of the financial crisis, failed to get approval for the tub and roof deck from the Department of Buildings, the New York Post reported.
"Now Roubini has been slapped with a violation and was ordered to remove the Jacuzzi, the deck and a party room he built, complete with a bar and bathroom, on the roof of his party penthouse," the paper wrote.

Exactly, with traditional currency, lots of energy is consumed guarding and moving gold bullions around, running ATM machines, coin sorting machines, cash registers, and payment processing services, and transporting money in armoured vehicles, and maintaining a god-damn army.
@_date: 2019-11-09 20:10:10
But it's happening frequently now; the trend's to repatriate now and hold it locally. Maybe in the future they will put it all back in Bank of England, the Federal Reserve and other big central banks; if they at all survive. Armored secured transportation is plenty wasteful because transporting 1000s of tons of precious metal generates tons of carbon. Gold is not transported on pickup trucks with a baton holding guard in the pickup area. Trained people are employed (who need to be paid a pretty penny as well). All these cost adds up on top of the air cargo costs. Bitcoin (with Layer 2) is less energy consuming, way more sophisticated and way more elegant than the current banking shebang.

Let's calculate the energy costs of a Fiat money system like the US dollar. 
Count up the cost of maintaining a huge army with low mpg vehicles like tanks, humvees, etc. A huge airforce with kerosene guzzling transporters, bombers, and of course the blue water navy with several destroyers, aircraft carriers, and remote naval bases.
Add to it the energy wasted by running millions of ATMs in air-conditioned chambers, the data centers, low mpg armored vans transporting money and gold, maintaining the mint and the printing press.
Add to it the energy consumed by mining and refining and transporting metals like gold, copper, nickel, etc used for storage bars and coins.
I am sure Bitcoin energy consumption would be a drop in the ocean in comparison and by far the greenest / derived from sustainable sources.
