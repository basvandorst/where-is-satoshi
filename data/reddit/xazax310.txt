Tell that to Mt GOX. Guess that didn't affect bitcoin as well....

For a second I thought it was TenX  then I remembered that was a bunch of lies :)

I don't remember email costing you thousands of dollars if you f-k it up.... until we get some Human-readable wallet addresses (something that could be a front end to the hashes) I see adoption still go going slowly especially when you have to copy-pasta your BTC address and doing it wrong, unlike email, can cost lots of money.  The faster transactions like Lightning network will come and improve everything, but users usability is fairly low.

It's not a feeling, that's pretty much correct. The idea was One CPU, one vote. Each person with there own computer would run a node, mine to that node, and transfer bitcoin from that node to others. In this instance no single person could amass enough computing power for 51% attack or control a majority of nodes to change the ledger.
Its the whole idea of the Byzantine system/problem satoshi sought to solve.

Yes. The idea is to spread hash around the globe. Much of BTC mining is centralized in China due to Bitmain and other ASIC manufactures being located there, along with deals for dirt-cheap electric. There's only a handful of farms located in US, such as Texas/Washington. Not on any same scale either.  In reality I see the biggest problem is the pools, those are a major centralizing factor.

Sounds a lot like [Schrutebucks]( although I think those are far more stable.

Nope just a Cryptominer and part-time terrible trader at crypto as well.

At this current range I'd say it's safe to say 7K EOY price.
@_date: 2019-02-07 12:24:23
I surely hope not. BTC was built on the back of there failures, scams, and the collapse. Now somehow everyone is looking to those same people to save Crypto prices?
More usage and adoption by everyday people is the only thing that will bring prices upward.

Good read. I only started back in 2012 right when the GPU train for Bitcoin was about to go off the rails. It's not as interesting now, as all of us GPU miners are just chasing profits or guessing which coin is the next "bitcoin". So far I've only seen very few, such as RVN, achieve leaps in price and adoption so quickly as bitcoin did.

Not saying it's a bad thing, just saying seeing a lot of people get overly excited, we're not quite out of the woods yet.

I share a similar experience, you can read my full story on [medium]( I mined BTC in 2012.

The whole point of bitcoin was to get away from banks into a trustless peer-to-peer system. Bitcoin is v1.0 of such a system. It's not perfect, but shows it can be done. Personally, screw that, there shouldn't be any "banking integration" with bitcoin. Banks literally caused 2008 market collapse, yet we what to integrate with them? You really have no idea what Cryptocurrency was meant for then.

It's a ruse to get people to buy more bitcoin so the OP can short it :)

Well at-least people can crypto-mine in a strong Authoritative country that doesn't believe in property rights.

They asked about the business I figured since its just a checking account not a loan, they wouldn't have a problem. However once i said that they just shut the door in my face.

So what happened in 2008? when multiple banks failed? Didn't Gov just bail out to BoA and Chase allowing them to buy up all the failed banks assets? What did the Federal(not really federal) reserve do?
