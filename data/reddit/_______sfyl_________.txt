Is Roger Ver allowed to dox his customers again on there?

Throwaway? Check my hilarious post history!

Doesn't matter, it's $75M that has to exit through an exchange which is going to ask questions. You can't move money around on that scale without flags going up everywhere, that's what those controls are specifically designed to catch. Receiving small amounts of money over time that add up to lots of money is even in itself illegal!

There's no Bitcoin business in the world that makes the sort of money you could hide $75M in, BitPay was one of the largest and they can't even avoid firing all their staff. The amount of close attention Bitcoin businesses must get would catch this right away anyway.

It's fucking hilarious.

For context, 8 is considered a lucky number in Chinese culture.

Those are all things Mike Hearn has proposed in the past and been blasted for. 
* [Mike Hearn, Foundation's Law &amp; Policy Chair, is pushing blacklists right now](
* [Mike Hearn proposes to build vulnerable censorship mechanism into Tor, opposes a fix for hidden service deanonymization, on Tor mailing list](
* [Mike Hearn's "Worst Case" XT Fork Scenario: Checkpoints, Ignore Longest Chain ](
The last video is a real kicker, where he describes completely centralizing Bitcoin under his control to exclude Chinese miners which don't agree with him.

Satoshi Nakamoto, 2009:


Wonder if he actually is so deluded he thinks it was his creation.
@_date: 2015-10-01 00:31:10
I doubt Hearn has that much foresight.

Check the one he gave to f2pool when they said they didn't want 8GB blocks, he told them that he would just re-write XT to deliberately exclude them from the network. I've never laughed so hard at such a self defeating email. 


He's saying he is going to attempt to code 50%+ of the network hashrate out, and they are just supposed to bow over and take my rule even though they *literally* have the one tool which can destroy the network. Seriously. If he ever had a chance of getting 75% of the hashrate to sign the XT dotted line, he just burned it right there. 
 


Heh.
