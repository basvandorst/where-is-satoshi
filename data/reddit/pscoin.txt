Bitcoin is a currency and not a playground. I think it is supposed to bring us a step forward in independent, secure international payment systems. I see bitcoin as the future of currency for an international deregulated world.

I think it is really cool; have experienced that once... The price generates a code, which can be scanned with a smartphone by you (customer) and you can directly pay it from your Bitcoin wallet..
I really wish we had something like that in Switzerland

I am sure bitcoin is one of the most anonymous payment methods that are available, or do you know another one? Nowadays, everything that happens online is not anonymous, but the bitcoin-code is protecting people as much as possible in todays high tech world, or what do you think?

There are many products that can be bought with Bitcoin; from fitness gadgets, clothes, beverages, food, technology stuff (computer etc). There are many lists available online which list you all the shops, which accept Bitcoin as a payment instrument. However, I created the first online search engine, where you can put a word in the search bar and it lists you all of your searched products that can be bought with Bitcoins.

Hi, I did the same a couple of weeks ago and I havent regretted it, yet. Paypal is really simple and safe; so, if you completely change to bitcoin, make sure that you check the sites on which you buy something first. I have never had a problem though. Where do you shop? and what do you usully buy with paypal/bitcoin?

"McAfee also says the growth of electronic currencies like Bitcoin is unstoppable, despite efforts by governments to curb their use."
I understand that the government is not happy about Bitcoin, since it basically overrules the governmental currency, which leads to the government having less power. However, I agree with McAfee, if people realize the importance of an international independent currency like Bitcoin, it has the potential to become big - do you think governments cannot stop Bitcoin? I think they can, if they really see a danger in it.

Bitcoin has a big potential; obviously also comes with risks. Due to its volatility, it is certainly not a fixed income instrument, which are preferred for retirement portfolios. However, if Bitcoin becomes more consumer used than speculator used, it has the potential to become an influential financial instrument that will belong in a retirement portfolio in the past.
