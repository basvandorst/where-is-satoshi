I think that's the case, how long till my btc will reach it's destination. Sorry to sound paniced just put in $50 a week till I reached this so it's a big deal to me lol

Hopefully they succeed, just means that btc will lower so we can get MOARRR~!

feel like now theres a bit more awareness than the start of the month. Any dips we will see people buying into bitcoin thinking it's their only chance before takeoff (which already happened). I think awesome days are coming

honestly when that happens and it drops to near nothing is when I will pick up a lot! I firmly believe that even if it ends up going nowhere in the future, people with a lot of money will try to manipulate market. Mine as well join the fun :P

I was using coinbase but I switched the bittrex, bittrex also got me some free btc by selling right before the bubbles burst

If you can wire transfer / want to do a bigger investment 1k+ I'd go to an exchange like bittrex or gemini (slightly more confusing but slightly cheaper).
If you want $500 or less and want to just use a card use coinbase it's super easy.
Regardless I'd recommend keeping your coins on electrum on a computer. Write down the 12 word phrase on a hard copy!!!

both are at @ 3650

It was the same as coinbase I checked. Besides like I said when it entered my wallet it was still 1000$ I'm thinking it was what the other guy said my first purchase was fee free
