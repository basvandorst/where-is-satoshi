I like Trump and I like Bitcoin.

5 years? Lol, I dunno.

You had me on your side all the way until the end. At the end when you insult everyone and say that you're glad you sold, it's obvious that you're spiteful for selling at a loss. Convince me I'm wrong. 
@_date: 2018-05-27 15:59:24
None of those numbers register in my memory. Wtf? Bitcoin went down to like $5600 or something on the first major correction, April 9th was my birthday and it definitely wasn't $12k, and what is this resistance thing at $6700 when I'd say the resistance seems to be now at $7300.
@_date: 2018-05-28 15:33:45
Accurate TA. 
@_date: 2018-05-16 02:41:54
$1,000,000 or John McAfee will eat his own dick.
@_date: 2018-05-03 21:37:02
$1, Bob. 
@_date: 2018-05-05 11:07:52
Lol, wow. That's incorrect.

I don't tell people to hold but when I don't know what to do, I hold. Haha

Made me a little money but gave me a lot of anxiety. 
@_date: 2018-10-10 17:37:49
I'm trying but I only mine about $.35/day... Haha

I think for 100%, you better wrap a rubber band around the base of the condom. Tight to lock in the love juice from impregnating anyone.
@_date: 2018-06-25 18:03:20
Yeah, as someone who has blown money on stupid stuff my entire life, I don't really care either. Haha 
@_date: 2019-10-27 11:42:58
If I had no real money but I had $1mil in btc... I mean... Fiat is still current. I'd probably take some money out...
@_date: 2019-06-12 21:52:22
Nah, he'd be a btc maximalist.
@_date: 2019-02-11 03:42:01
Yes. 
@_date: 2019-10-27 11:45:24
Yeah. Earlier TIL about r/FemaleDatingStrategy
I got banned from that sub shortly after discovery.

Some of us aren't even whales. I threw in my tax return of $2400 into alts. Made $700 in the last week and got out. It's luck but it's also knowing I should take my profit. I'm sure I'm not alone. If you've been following crypto for some years, hodling isn't always the best.

You must be on the east coast. Lol
@_date: 2019-04-04 14:12:48
If it crashes back down to that, I think a good majority of people will cash out and quit crypto. I would. 
@_date: 2018-11-29 23:30:10
How old are you?
@_date: 2018-11-22 04:43:21
That looks like it should dispense arcade tokens... 
@_date: 2018-11-28 16:13:03
I don't get it? How's this relate?

At least she's still pretty.
@_date: 2018-04-25 16:54:46
I've been accurate on dips before also. Ooooooh. Want a trophy? Haha, TA is still bullshit. This is an unregulated market. Stop being naive.

Libertarian'ish here. Kind of a Centrist. 
@_date: 2018-04-13 13:32:15
First off, it doesn't stand for "hold on for dear life". I don't know who started that shit. It's just a misspelled "hold". You can sell or hold however you see fit but people have been saying hodl, especially during the bear market as a confidence that the market will recover. Don't sell for a loss. Hodl.

You jinxed us all. Beanie babies aren't worth shit anymore. Shit! 
@_date: 2018-12-25 15:21:04
Between $60-90k. That's only if we've started the next bullrun. Otherwise $7-10k. Which to many is still very optimistic. I can't help it. I'm an optimist. Real talk? $5k.
@_date: 2018-12-28 19:01:08
Love dags! I try to pet every dag I come across. 6 years and I've never been bit. 
@_date: 2018-12-25 01:35:07
Weird.
