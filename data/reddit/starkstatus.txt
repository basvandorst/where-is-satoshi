Well All Bitcoin transactions are stored publicly and permanently on the network, which means anyone can see the balance and transactions of any Bitcoin address. However, the identity of the user behind an address remains unknown until information is revealed during a purchase or in other circumstances.

Bitcoin is not fraud Belfort is saying that cause all the other guys started this “get rich schemes” and his mad because they got there before him. Think about it... he was the first one who got company built on fraud back in times. Pump and Dump... now he sees everyone making money on people who are interested in bitcoins or cryptocurrencies and his mad that’s why his talking shit .

It could be but bitcoin is not 100% anonymous so I don’t think it would be a pump and dump

The most important factor to take into consideration when you are MINING BTC its ENERGY MANAGEMENT
Of course, all those that have been mining for years, overclock them miners, use immersion cooling and the best one, go NORTH in the GLOBE or COLD temperature regions to get them even cheaper.
If you can get your rate under 4 cents your total cost should not be more than 6 cents all in. No wonder why COLOCATION SITES are a good INVESTMENT then.
