I know!  It’s like this one employee I have, in 1994 I raised his salary to $40,000, and he was excited.  Now I cut it from $80,000 back to $40,000, and he’s all upset!  WTF, it’s the same number!  The irony!

Coinbase or Circle.  I would not put more than 5% of your total investment portfolio into it.  Bitcoin is awesome but still young and risky.
@_date: 2016-04-29 01:39:43
Observational bias.  The price is determined by many factors, not just the news.  So, with good news, sometimes it will coincidentally go up, sometimes it will go down.  When it goes up, you think nothing of it because it makes sense. When it goes down, you notice this because it doesn't make sense.

Am I the only one who thinks that Satoshi selling all of his coins wouldn't be that big of a deal long term?  The market would crash, and eventually re-equilibrate.

Honestly I'm not sure that it's possible to know, especially in a market as small as Bitcoin.
@_date: 2016-04-26 22:34:28
It's a trade off.  Would I prefer to own actual bitcoins?  Sure, and I do.  However, the retirement fund issue is real, and many are willing to pay the premium because of this.  Will this eventually cause a price collapse once there are more ETFs on the market?  Maybe, I don't know.  Will it collapse below the actual Bitcoin price?  I doubt it, but also possible.  Will the Bitcoin price eventually rise to meet the GBTC price, making the issue irrelevant for long term hodlers?  I think that's likely.

I recommend splitting them up into these categories:
1) Offline wallets (paper, hardware)
2) Software wallets (desktop and phone, both with cloud and paper seed backups)
3) Online wallets -- the only one I would recommend is Coinbase multisig vault, but any one where you control the private keys is ok
Edit:  I would also like to reiterate others' advice that your life savings should not be in Bitcoin.  5% is the rule of thumb.
Edit2:  When I say phone, that's assuming your phone is passcode protected with immediate lockout.

I'm talking about initial investment; not saying you should keep it at 5% as it goes up.  When to sell is a different, more difficult question.

I’ve been using them for four years without issue but I guess I’ll stop now because of this post.
Edit: Not trying to be a dick, and not saying I don’t sympathize with OP’s situation, I’m just saying that your poor experience is not necessarily a reason for every single Coinbase customer to stop using them.  Just as my good experience is not a reason for every person in the world to sign up with them. 
There are not just two stances, “Love Coinbase” or “boycott Coinbase.”  There is an in between.  I acknowledge that they have issues but weighing all factors, they are the best solution for me at this time.
In addition, I don’t personally believe that Coinbase is evil.  Most of their issues are due to rapid growth and compliance with regulations.  The unfortunate fact is that if you are moving $50k into a regular bank account in the US, it raises red flags.  It shouldn’t, but it does.
@_date: 2018-01-19 20:24:06

There is also a company called Bitcoin IRA but they charge insane fees (like 10%).  So you either pay a huge premium with GBTC or the hassle and fees of Bitcoin IRA.

You shouldn't, but those aren't the only two options.  Once Bitcoin becomes a boring, stable universal cash, you'd probably want to diversify your holdings into stocks or other investments as well.

Mining hardware becomes obsolete very quickly, so you must constantly upgrade.  It is by no means passive income, it is a ruthlessly competitive business like any other, with razor thin profit margin.
There are two likely scenarios:
1) The price of Bitcoin continues to go up.  In this case, you could have made money just by buying and holding.
2) The price of Bitcoin goes down.  In this case, your mining business will become less and less profitable, and your mining equipment will quickly become worthless. You'll never get that money back.  If you had the coins, at least you could wait it out and hope they go up in the future, or sell them.
@_date: 2017-12-10 13:44:56
Lost coins are not a problem, the remaining coins can be subdivided and fewer coins just means higher value for everyone else.
Edit:  Also, it is impossible to distinguish lost coins from long term held coins, so it is pointless to even try to come up with a solution to this supposed problem.

I'm neither a fan nor a hater of Bitcoin Cash, and while I do think it's an irresponsible thing to say on TV, I actually agree with him about insider trading.  I think insider trading leads to conspicuous price moves, which clues everyone else that something is up (kind of like what happened in this case).  Whereas if it's banned (and no one actually does it), people are blindsided.

I disagree with this meme, and here's why.  If Bitcoin gets to the point where it's a major global currency, and each coin is worth the equivalent of millions of today's dollars, then at that point its meteoric rise will be over.  It would still probably slowly increase in value over time but not much.
So at that point in time, it would basically be like regular cash.  You would be foolish to hold a large investment portfolio consisting of just cash.  So when Bitcoin gets to that point, it would make sense to diversify into stocks which will likely have better returns.
@_date: 2018-09-06 20:04:06

That's a one-dimensional, Ferengi-like interpretation of the profit motive, which is not how the real profit motive actually works.  All companies have to strike a balance between pleasing their customers so they return and spread positive word of mouth, and scamming them to get a profit.  In the scenario you describe, people would just use another company, and the machine would learn that and stop killing people.

Let's be insanely generous and say that cloud mining has a return of 1% (an egregiously high number that has no bearing in reality).

I see your point, but this exact same data and incentive exists for human corporations today.  I don't see why it would be any different for machines. Yes, a deflationary currency does change things a bit, but I'm not sure that it changes the incentive.  Companies can make cash behave in a deflationary way by investing it in the stock market, so they have the same incentive.

Everyone is equally crappy about predicting the future, but I doubt banks are going anywhere.

Predicting and timing the market is impossible.
For a lump sum, research has shown that putting it all in at once is superior to dollar cost averaging, for assets that go up more often than they go down (like stocks, and possibly bitcoin).
For multiple buys over time (i.e. You don't have the money right now but you want to invest a portion of each paycheck), dollar cost averaging is best.

Market manipulation only works in the short term.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:39:48
It won't know the specific price you paid, but if it uses the price difference from the same index at the time you acquired it and the time you spent it, the difference might be close enough, and inaccuracies would probably cancel out over time.  It would not factor in any fees you paid, but this would actually underestimate your cost basis slightly, which would be in the IRS's favor, so it wouldn't get you in trouble and the inaccuracy would be pretty small.
@_date: 2014-03-31 22:37:55
I was thinking more of a large number of addresses.  Many wallets assign a separate address for each transaction, so if someone has a weekly auto-buy, they would have to input 52 addresses.
But perhaps you are right that this could be accomplished without modifying Bitcoin.  The same result might be achieved by either linking accounts or merging reports.  That is, each company creates a transaction report for the user by address, in a common format, and then some software merges the reports into one personal block chain for that user, matching up the addresses.
Regardless, I think we can agree that this problem can be solved by software.

Fair enough.  But I think we can be pretty certain that the excitement over shedding the dollar that exists among many bitcoiners does not exist in the majority of the population.
@_date: 2014-03-31 19:41:00
I wasn't arguing that it was necessary, only that it was helpful.  Putting all your addresses into tax software is the burdensome part.  For off-chain transactions, the exchanges will already know if it's a self transfer, unless you have more than one account on an exchange, which is not the norm.
@_date: 2014-09-24 23:37:49

True, but as bitcoin gains adoption and market cap, the price should stabilize, and would be more like an interest-bearing savings account (slow, steady increase).
@_date: 2014-11-10 09:45:59
Some of them aren't true, and the ones that are true aren't that surprising, as explained here:  
There was so an article awhile back where they picked pairs of presidents at random and were able to find equally "eerie" coincidences for all of them.  People have lots of data points, and the odds that none of them will be the same are low.
@_date: 2014-08-16 18:35:17
Agreed.  In addition, this will make no difference in the long term price.  The only difference it will make is preventing buying opportunities for people with less money.

@_date: 2014-11-16 12:13:09
Again, talking about average person.  Even if bitcoin gains universal adoption, very few people are going to care what a block reward is.
@_date: 2014-06-21 19:15:42
Even if the dollar was taxed like Bitcoin you still wouldn't have to pay capital gains tax on it because it doesn't gain value with time.  So the flipside of this argument is that bitcoin gains value and we get to keep 85% of it.
@_date: 2014-11-16 20:28:49

@_date: 2014-09-23 03:12:58
That's why I said "upper limit" and not "actual value."  I didn't feel like looking up how many bitcoins will exist in 10 years, and the number lost is impossible to know.
@_date: 2014-11-02 12:17:53
It's impossible to give a definite answer without being able to predict the future.  Putting it in bitcoin is higher risk with much higher potential reward and also the possibility of total loss.  Putting it toward your mortgage is low risk with guaranteed small reward and no potential for loss.

I think it will stay close to parity, but I can't decide if it will be:

2) below parity due to lack of utility as a currency

I thought I read somewhere that increasing block size only required a soft fork. Is this not the case?
@_date: 2015-05-15 03:29:37
I see.  That sucks.
@_date: 2015-05-08 01:52:10
I know very little about this, so someone please explain if I am wrong.  But it seems to me that the main argument against increasing the block size is that it will make it easier to spam the blockchain.  However, we are not yet even filling all of the 1 MB blocks, so if it were true that extra block space gets filled with spam, wouldn't it be happening already?

I don't hear this said very often, but personally I prefer a mix of all different methods, since each method has different risks.

Don't store it all in one place.  Split it between multiple paper wallets (split keys and stored in different locations), a variety of desktop wallets, breadwallet, and (gasp!) Coinbase multisig vault.

It's always been amazing to me that a ledger entry in a piece of software can be worth $400.  
But then I remember how my college roommate and I used to manage our finances.  We never split the cost of bills or anything, one of us would just pay for it and then on a dry erase board we'd write down half of the cost as a balance owed by the other person.  The person in debt would then pay for the next thing, and the balance would flip the other way.  This continued for four years, and at the end we paid whatever the last balance was.  If the whole world had used our dry-erase board, that's essentially Bitcoin.

I have to say, I disagree with both sides of this debate.  There are risks to storing your Bitcoin with a reputable third party, and there are different risks to storing it yourself.  Similar to cash in that respect.  Luckily money is divisible and you don't have to use just one storage method.

This has been discussed for years, my personal opinion is that since computers can do unit conversion seamlessly, there is absolutely no reason for people to have to learn a new currency unit in order to use Bitcoin.

Almost everyone will say no, but I believe that storing some (not the majority) with Coinbase is not a bad idea.  You spread out some of the risk, particularly of losing your own coins due to a mistake on your part.  Of course, with Coinbase you also have the risk of theft or fraud.  The risk might be higher with Coinbase, but they are also different risks from personal storage.

I see what you're saying.  That's true.  But what I meant was, they probably have their funds divided among multiple cold storage wallets, each of which was created/split on a different computer.  So if one of these was compromised, they would lose some fraction of their funds but not all.

With thousands/millions of users, there are going to be complaints. We just see a lot of them because a lot of Bitcoin users use Reddit.  We do not see posts from the thousands of satisfied customers, because they are satisfied.  Some of the complaints are probably from people with financial situations that trigger red flags in the hyper-regulatory environment, others are just random chance or actual customer service failures.
Edit:  it's entirely possible that Coinbase has substandard customer service (I have no idea since I've never had to use their customer service), but I don't think the company as a whole is as horrible as this sub suggests.

Agree about the hardware wallets.  I've never understood the appeal.  Especially since it's recommended that you create a seed phrase in case the hardware breaks, write it down on paper, and store it in a safe place.  So ... if you're going to be storing paper anyway, why do you need the hardware?
I don't necessarily agree about not using software though.  I like to split my storage among several methods, software, paper, multisig, even mobile (with backup).  The risks are different for each one.

If you are not planning to spend for a while, I personally prefer paper wallets to hardware wallets.

If you're going to have to securely store a piece of paper anyway, you might as well just have a paper wallet.

It's interesting to look back on, because really the only debate is over when the halving becomes priced in, because clearly at some point it is, but it's just as clear that the 2136 halving is not priced in.

good explanation. One thing that's hard to grasp is why proof of work is necessary.  My understanding is that it:
1) Proves that you have a CPU dedicated to mining, and aren't just running a thousand copies of the application on one computer, and
2) Ensure that only one computer gets assigned the reward.
What I wonder about (2) is, couldn't the network just randomly choose one user with a verified block for the reward? Or is this not possible on a decentralized network?

Hello, I'm one of the idiots who deliberately left some Bitcoins on Coinbase.  Here's why:
1) I did not think Bitcoin Cash would be worth much (whoops).
2) It was a small percentage of my total bitcoins.
3) I use the multisig vault, so getting them out is difficult, and I do control the keys, and figured eventually someone would make a recovery tool to get the Bitcoin Cash out.

There's no need to store it all one way.  Put some in Coinbase, some in paper wallets, some in hardware wallets.  Spread out the different risks.  And for the Coinbase part, at least use the multisig vault, so you're covered if they go out of business.

Actually you're right, it isn't.  I was thinking fewer users would mean fewer transactions and thus a shorter chain, but that's not how it works.  Blocks are generated every 10 minutes regardless.  Unless there are zero transactions in which case I assume there would be no blocks.

From an investment standpoint, the key thing to understand is that there will only be 21 million bitcoins, ever.  So as the Bitcoin economy expands, the only way to increase the money supply is to subdivide the bitcoins into smaller fractions.

What will absolutely be priced in is the effect on mining revenue.  For serious miners, this is their business and they will plan for it.  There will be some disruption, but in the end the difficulty will adjust and reach equilibrium.

Banks add their own rate to the prime rate, so it's not like you can actually get a zero interest loan.  So isn't this rate the same as what it would be in a free market if there were no central bank?  Isn't it a good thing that they set rates to zero, because it mimics the situation in which they didn't exist?

Gold was a great currency in the past.  It is hard to counterfeit, durable, scarce, and small amounts of it are easily portable.  Fiat has even better portability and can be used electronically, but has the disadvantage of not being scarce (ie inflation).  However, despite inflation, people still found fiat more useful in modern life than gold.  It's hard to buy something from someone across the world with gold.  Bitcoin combines all of the advantages of both Gold and fiat, and is a better currency than both.

I just meant that it still requires a lot of work.  Finding tenants, dealing with them and problems in the building like maintenance, painting, unexpected stuff like pipes busting, etc.  It basically just multiplies the frequency of all the usual issues that come with home ownership.  Of course you can pay a property manager, but that cuts deeply into your profits.  There are also property taxes and insurance costs.  And the value of your time.
I think people imagine real estate as just sitting back and letting the money roll in, but I think its important to realize there’s more to it than that.  Plus there is the risk of your property’s value declining.   By the time all of these things are factored in, I would personally prefer to get my passive income from a mutual fund.

When to sell is a tough question, because in the future this could be worth billions or pennies.
I’ve thought about this a lot for many years.  I think the best practice is to pick two or three major life goals, and sell a proportional fraction of it when it can pay for those goals.
Example: sell half when it can pay for a home, sell the other half when it’s enough to retire.
A couple of other recommendations:
1) I would sell 10% now and put it in the mainstream investment of your choice, just to make sure you have something to show for it in case bitcoin fails.
2) Of the remaining amount, I would transfer about 15% to Ethereum, just for diversification in the event that crypto succeeds but bitcoin doesn’t.
Edit:  Don’t let anyone tell you that real estate is passive income.

I don't agree that a 51% attack leads to "incredible profits."  The attacker could do one double spend and everyone would immediately notice.  If you're talking about a pool, miners would immediately drop out of that pool.  If you're talking about a single individual or organization, it is unlikely to be feasible economically.  They would not be doing it for profit, since the damage to Bitcoin would make any profits irrelevant.  So they would have to be doing it to harm Bitcoin.  But for every group that wants to harm Bitcoin, there are a thousand that want to profit.  So if it's that easy to buy 51%, then others can easily do it too.

2) Choose a monthly amount (in fiat) that you can afford to lose.  Set an automatic buy for that amount.

How are these two facts reconciled:

Sure.  I don't actually think it would destroy Bitcoin.  I just think that's the only possible motivation behind such an attack, because it would not be particularly profitable.  The only way to profit from a double spend is to quickly send to an exchange, then sell for fiat before the double spend is noticed and the transaction is reversed.  You can only double your money, you can't create Bitcoin out of thin air.  So let's say you start out with 10,000 bitcoins.  Do you think an exchange is going to let you sell and withdraw that much fiat quickly with no questions?

To buy, yes.  I don't think you need one to sell.  But regardless, in this hypothetical scenario, you would not need to buy or sell.  You'd get paid in Bitcoin via Bitwage, and it would go to your Coinbase account, where you could spend it with Shift.

Gox stopped allowing withdrawals of USD, but Bitcoin could still be transferred, so anyone with any USD in Gox was buying Bitcoin, creating an upward pressure on the price.  It was also the first time that Bitcoin had been widely publicized in mainstream media, so many people were finding out about it for the first time.

I believe there will be a significant price rise after the 2016 halving, for the following reason:  Coinbase allows automatic buys at regular intervals, and many people are probably buying a fixed dollar amount every month or week.  This constant influx of cash, coupled with a decrease in new supply, should lead to a price rise.
But I could be wrong, no one can predict the future.
@_date: 2016-05-31 20:28:38
Let's just go ahead and get this exchange out of the way, which happens every time GBTC is mentioned:
"Why would anyone want to own fake paper bitcoins rather than the real thing?"
"Because they can use retirement account money."
"You can do a self-directed IRA that holds bitcoins directly."
"Yes but that's a pain."
@_date: 2015-10-28 13:03:30
You're overlooking the fact that EVERYONE's Bitcoin goes up in value a little bit in a burn.  Add all of those increases up, and the amount is exactly equal to the amount of Bitcoin burned.  So it's like giving one cent to 100 people versus giving a dollar to one person.  Mathematically identical.
@_date: 2016-05-28 18:03:51
They do, but the opportunity for arbitrage tends to eliminate itself.  That is, to take advantage of arbitrage, you must buy on the exchange with the lower price and sell on the one with the higher price ... but every buy order tends to push the lower price up, and every sell order pushes the higher price down.
@_date: 2015-03-31 13:47:46

I don't thing multiple signers is the best use case of Multisig for personal funds.  Better to use it for splitting a paper wallet into multiple locations, all of which are controlled by you, so that if one is destroyed or stolen you've got the others.  Multiple-person signing is best used for organizations.

When are people going to learn that this market, like any other, cannot be timed?  It will go up, it will go down, no one knows why.  You're not going to trade your way to wealth.  If you believe in Bitcoin, dollar cost average and ignore the price.  If you don't, don't.
Edit:  I'm also tired of the false dichotomy of "in it for a quick buck versus believe in the technology."  It is possible to believe in Bitcoin and also want to get rich slowly.
@_date: 2015-02-01 21:19:39
Exactly.  There is no line between "manipulation" and regular trading.  It's all just people voluntarily exchanging stuff.
Besides, manipulation can only make a difference in the short term.  The long term price will be determined by fundamentals.  And if you're not in it for the long term, then you're a gambler, not an investor.

Yeah, that makes sense.  But since everyone has the option of doing this, it seems that you could cancel out the effect by just looking at longer time frames, rather than excluding certain exchanges.  Of course, since Coinbase has had no fees for its whole existence, that's not really an option in this case.
@_date: 2015-02-18 18:21:36
Yes I would. If a site paid you a million dollars per trade would you compare them to the one that paid you a cent per trade?  By your logic they should be in the same category, right?

I do.  With a hardware wallet you're going to have to write down the seed phrase and keep it in a safe place.  If you're having to keep a piece of paper safe anyway, and all you're doing is storing, I figure you might as well just use a paper wallet.
Personally I like the m of n split key -- any two of three (or whatever numbers you want) keys can unlock the coins.  I store the three keys in three different locations.
