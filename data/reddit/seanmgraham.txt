I find your lack of security transparency....disturbing. 
edit: no star wars fans i guess

After you sign up when new stock is in there will be Bitcoin buttons for purchasing the discounted codes.

Do you know any other people who would also be interested in this service?

This is actually an awesome idea. Get bitcoin into the hands of 8 year old pranksters!
@_date: 2016-12-16 12:23:25
I'm honored to be the victim of your theft, sir. Thanks! If you wind up building a version PM me. I'd love to play around with it.
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:48:03
Scrutinize away! I'm just happy to have you as a reader :) I look forward constructive criticism from you in the future. Do you have any topic of Bitcoin you'd wanna read about?
@_date: 2013-09-02 00:23:30
I believe a healthy mix will produce the best future for Bitcoin. Some people spending if it suits them and others hoarding.
@_date: 2013-08-19 00:15:21
In a normal datacenter sure. But I highly doubt Inputs.io is being that reckless with their data. It would make no sense to spend months coding and months launching a business and yet spend no time protecting your main asset of your business.

Don't worry, you're not an asshole lol. I am a full time student so I work mostly during the summer and the 4K+ is whats left after paying some of my student debt. Every dollar is precious to me as my job future after college is dicey(I'm an Entrepreneurship/Management Major) so Bitcoin has and is still a way to make money to pay down college debt.

You're not a dick. I get that you've had bad experiences with people trying to game the system and i agree those people are unhelpful to the entire bitcoin community. I can understand why my piece met those standards in your eyes and can only say my future work will be more in line with the blogs we both idolize. That sounds very interesting! PM when you get your blog up and running or if you need help setting up the site.
@_date: 2013-07-21 15:08:07
Thanks! I will of course do this in the future I just wrote this to help anyone else like me(lazy/dumb) who think you can put money online without these precautions and get away with it.

If you buy them cheaply enough(get in on a group buy or a find a cheap internet source) you will theoretically make back the cost if you run it for its lifetime. But if you're buying a mining rig for ROI then expect to invest 10x as much to generate any kind of worthwhile returns. Since most people don't have that much capital to risk these USB Block Erupters are like hobby miners.
@_date: 2013-08-12 13:48:37
been there. it's a terrible experience I wouldn't wish on anyone.
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:11:45
Judge each article please. I'm doing my best to present my own views of analysis. If you don't like it then downvote but at least give the articles a chance. Im taking all criticism into account to write better content.
@_date: 2013-09-02 12:29:26
I respect your opinion and agree that bitcoin has already displayed enough momentum and usability to continue to prosper however i beleive a paradigm shift in the way most people respond to bitcoin booms could help bitcoin progress faster. Just my opinion. Thanks for the intelligent commentary!
@_date: 2013-07-21 05:28:59
Thank you for reading! I wish i read something like this earlier, it would've saved me a few bucks lol I think I'm just going to stay away from exchanges and keep all my coins away from any exchanges or online wallets for now. I knew about Bitcoin being volatile but I never thought that I could get malware this bad and suffer something like this. I learned the hard way I'm not as smart as I thought I was but I will come back from this and make back the money I lost.

With all the android wallet security issues leading to thefts a lot of Bitcoiners have become hyper-sensitive to security and are now overlooking great services in response.

This is about the future of 2013. Not about previous success stories. ASICminer is quickly losing market share to a half dozen other ASIC manufacturers. They're definitely a great stock pick but I just don't see the same kind of growth for the rest of this year. 
@_date: 2013-07-21 14:34:16
Hard to tell ATM as I've run three seperate antivirus programs and haven't found anything yet. I just know i saw "stronghold Online Backup" in my processes and I have no clue what that thing is.
@_date: 2013-07-21 05:17:20
Go with a local dealer to avoid giant fees. Use  to find traders in your area. OR you can use BitInstant.com and pay from any walmart or cvs in your area and get the coins sent to your wallet. Stay away from exchanges unless you are taking every security precaution and need to trade often! If you don't trade often then keep your coins in a more secure wallet.
@_date: 2013-09-02 12:26:03
Good point. What do you think the percentage of businesses that convert their btc to fiat the first chance they get. I'd imagine at least some keep bitcoin on hand?
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:39:30
If you have such a problem with news and links coming from smaller blogs and other independent sources then I suggest you stop looking on Reddit(a community, and contribution based website) and go somewhere else. The heart of Reddit is about letting the community at large decide what is worth reading and gives tiny blogs like mine a chance to shine with the big dogs if it is deemed worthy. If you'd rather mindlessly sift through the "New" section only looking for established news sites then go ahead but you're missing out on some great content from the underdogs of the industry.
By the way, Coindesk is also a favorite of mine and they always have great articles. Coding In My Sleep was the first place I read about Bitcoin so it has a special place in my heart too. I just wanted you to know my posts aren't meant to be spammy as I am just trying to build upon the great sites that are already out there and put my own 2 cents in. I respect if you disagree and only ask for more constructive criticism in the future if you find the time for it. Peace and love.

Looking back at what i wrote last night(I wasn't in the best mood haha) I can see how I use "terrible security" in relation to MtGox although what I was trying to illustrate was only that MtGox has all these measures available(Yubikey,2FA) but leave them optional even though they are a must-have to prevent things like this. I am not shifting blame as I know this was all my own responsibility I just wish they would make some of these security measures mandatory and stop this from happening to someone like me in the future.
Save the noobs of the future!
@_date: 2013-08-19 01:44:39
probably better off selling it. the ASIC hype is now at ridiculous heights as everyone is saying it's the future of mining. could probably get a hefty price for it.
@_date: 2013-08-26 22:46:19
Thanks for the info and input!
@_date: 2013-09-02 01:36:57
While i respect your laissez-faire mindset you are implying that people(on the whole) are making correct interpretations of the market. I think that people are generally stupid and do what keeps them from risk which may or may not be what the market requires for continued prosperity.
I never said that the economy was harmed by hoarding I merely implied that spending BTC on things you would buy anyway with cash is the better strategy for the overall success of this currency.
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:29:04
USB Block Erupters are a not a great "investment" per say but that doesn't make them a bad buy. Think of them like a gadget rather than a tool for making money. Gadgets don't necessarily make money, they just perform a function that the user gets happiness from. A lot of people who hear about Bitcoin get so excited they want to be a part of the whole thing(without risking their entire savings) and so they purchase something like an Erupter to statisfy that urge.
tl;dr - Think of these more like gadgets and less like serious mining rigs and it makes much more sense.
@_date: 2013-08-13 21:35:33
Well some of us bitcoiners consider every major a step a to the future a success. It's only by constantly getting news and info out there to the public that we convince business leaders and politicians to take notice. The movement is only growing.

When is gen 2 scheduled to roll out?

Hmm I've never heard such a cogent comparison of those three stores of value. Great comment!
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:07:43
Its not a top 5 list of best Bitcoin companies. It's about which companies have opportunities to do unique things in the coming year. 
@_date: 2013-08-27 04:44:37
Thanks for the suggestion. I'll take a look and give you a shout out if I wind up writing something up!
@_date: 2013-09-02 00:20:12
A BTC spent is going to be spent more times by more people. If you have no interest in any of the products offered from the multitude of Bitcoin sellers then by all means don't buy anything. However if you have the option of cashing out and spending that money versus keeping it in the economy and spending it then the latter is preferable. That's all I'm saying.
@_date: 2013-07-21 23:41:49
Trying to explain Bitcoin to close minded people is one of the biggest struggles of my life. Keep up the good work!
@_date: 2013-08-19 14:15:15
I personally beleive in Draper and beleive the incubater model is an avenue for quick prototyping and funding that Bitcoin sorely needs. Maybe a new incubater will take the spotlight and deliver something in which case I'll write about them. But for now Coinlab is what we're stuck with and I'm gonna give them a shot. 
@_date: 2013-08-19 16:44:19
Scrutinize me! Keep me in gear. I only ask you keep your criticism constructive so can improve. 
@_date: 2013-09-02 00:22:07
Bitcoin is by design a limited resource. If more people know about and use said resource then the resource becomes more valuable. It's common sense and the reason why media attention and publicity put upward pressure on the Bitcoin price.
@_date: 2013-08-18 20:52:22
I think the word "easily" is being used a little too lightly in this sentence. Stealing Bitcoins physically from their server is as "easy" as stealing millions from a physical bank if not more difficult due to new Bitcoin security and tracing companies that are popping up. Just because a break in is possible doesnt mean easy or even likely.
@_date: 2013-07-25 19:34:29
Some people learn better by doing things than by reading about them. I am one of those people. Running a miner for $100 bucks and getting actual Bitcoins into an actual wallet would educate me much faster in how Bitcoins work than just reading about someone else doing it. Sorry if you can't contemplate that other people learn differently than you.
Using your GPU to mine for Bitcoins slows your computer down way too much to be feasible for any kind of hobbyist who ALSO needs their computer. They are newbie friendlier in the fact that you can run one off a computer you already have without affecting the computers functionality.
