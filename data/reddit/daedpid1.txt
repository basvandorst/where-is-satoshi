The technology (the math) is fundamentally the same. So it would affect crypto currencies. You can't have digital signing &amp;amp; verification without encryption.

Whenever I hear bitcoin being described as any traditional financial term all I hear is "horseless carriage." It'll be a while before our culture is properly equipped to describe it.

You're not forced to use someone's OSS project. If it has problems, even security problems you have three choices: Abandon, fix it yourself, or pay someone (most likely the original developers) to fix it.
You can expect them to fix it all you want, but if you are not contributing it doesn't matter if you're a user. You'll be waiting.

I can use the public key from one of your bitcoin addresses to send you a scrambled message. If the government were serious about crippling encryption they would have to cripple all of cryptography or be left with an incomplete endeavor.

They addressed this. Back in the day nobody thought e-commerce would work out because what advantage would the internet bring over just going to the mall?
... well here we are.
You're also basing your decision on your own point of view. Sure right now bitcoin doesn't offer **you** much advantage over **your** credit card. But guess what, there are 100s of millions of people on this planet that cannot get access to a credit card or traditional financial services. Many of these people do have access to the internet though. Bitcoin opens up the possibility for these people to connect to each other financially.

Open Source = Buyer beware
If a specific bug in an open source ecosystem is affecting a particular industry, then it's up to that industry to pony up the funds to fix that bug, not the developers.
Open source developers aren't vendors or suppliers. They are developers, if you want them to do something than you have to pay them.

I did not compare bitcoin to e-commerce. Pay attention. I compared people's reaction to e-commerce back in the mid 90's to you're reaction to bitcoin today. People genuinely thought it would never pan out, but it did and we're all better for it.
I have nothing invested in bitcoin that I am not willing to lose. It certainly might not pan out, but if you can't see how this could positively impact the rest of the human race than I truly feel sorry for you and your myopic perspective.
The traditional financial system is not designed for the entire human race. Frankly, neither is bitcoin since it depends on the internet but that at least reaches far more people than banks do.

OSS is not a business model, it's a development model. If you are the user and expect your vendor to fix issues for you then you shouldn't be using open source software directly. You should buy software and services from a software vendor.
As an example, if you'd like to use the JBoss application server which is OSS, but would like vendor support than you should buy that support from Redhat. If on the other hand you decide to use it without that support and something goes wrong you can't expect the development community to fix it for you. You can ask them nicely, perhaps even pay some of them to look into it for you, but you can't **expect** them to do it in a timely fashion just because it's causing you problems. The software is provided as is.


For many projects this is true, but again, you can't expect it to work 100% for your needs without you supporting the development process.


OSS developers are not selling products. And if they were than you'd be agreeing with me, you'd by buying into it by supporting them.
That's how it works for all major OSS projects. Linux has the linux foundation and apache has the apache foundation. These foundations receive funds from the software's major users and vendors and use those funds to support the development process. 
There was a post here on reddit a few days ago from the developers asking for this exact kind of support. Mt.Gox treated the developers like vendors, they're not.

You probably used google to find that the BRL x USD exchange to be about 2.2. That's the official exchange rate in Brazil. But if you actually to try to buy dollars in Brazil the best you'll get is 2.4. So 1160 BRL turns out to about 483 USD.

If your using open source software without going through a vendor willing to provide support than yes! The licenses are pretty clear. The software is provided as is and under the condition that the authors not be held responsible for any damages that might be caused by such software. 
The licenses are all pretty clear about this. 
I can turn this around on you: do you expect developers to work for you free under an SLA when they provide you source code willingly?

Why using any open source software?
Because time has shown that for common infrastructure (kernels, compilers, protocol reference implementations, crypto currencies, etc) OSS is the best development model around. But OSS is just a development model, not a business model. It's up to the market to create business models that leverage the OSS development model to sell software and services. Just because the developers aren't willing to offer warranty doesn't mean that other can't.
Right now bitcoin is still very young, it's much like how GNU and Linux were back in the mid 90's, people saw the potential but the businesses weren't mature enough. But now they are, if you were to create a datacenter company today and wanted to use linux you'd be a fool not to contract the support from a software vendor.
For bitcoin the space is there for similar businesses. Right now securing a wallet is not an easy task for most people. Bitcoin allows people to be their own banks but the truth is most people aren't willing or competent to be their own banks. There's space in the market for businesses to provide this service on top of bitcoin, and just like how linux based software vendors fund the linux development process (pay developers to work on it full time), the companies wishing to offer bitcoin support would have to do the same in order to be competent with their support and be leaders in their market.
But I'll answer your question. I use it because I believe in the technology, most users who stick with bitcoin feel as I do. We believe it's here to stay and that it will change the world for the better.
Why do you use it?
@_date: 2014-10-22 13:20:35
You are correct. Regardless, I'm not convinced that the ISO in question places any such restriction.
On a side note, am I to understand that the blockchain uses 32bit unix code timestamps? If so that's going to be a problem in a couple of decades.
@_date: 2014-02-27 17:26:12
I think there's much wrong with bitcoin. Nothing that can't be fixed with time and work though.
What I'm trying to say to you is that just because it doesn't have any value for you and your colleagues does not mean it can't have tremendous value for other people. 
You trade in stocks which automatically makes me believe that you have no idea what it's like for the rest of humanity who might not even have a word for stocks. Through bitcoin or something like it these people will be able to participate in the global economy in a far more equal footing to someone so privileged as yourself.

That would constitute supporting the development process. Than yes you can have reasonable expectations such as you've described. 
Usually this is done by vendors who hire OSS developers to work full time on their specific projects. My understanding is that none of the exchanges have hired developers to work on the OSS components of bitcoin. I might be wrong about this, but Mt.Gox certainly was a completely in house affair.
Does the Bitcoin Foundation pay the developers full time, and are they funded by the exchanges? I'm also ignorant about this.
@_date: 2014-10-17 17:06:36
Correct. The iOS app FireChat would be an example of a mesh network. It's a chat program that uses bluetooth mesh networks to get around censorship from carriers and isps.

Mistakes happen.
It's also straight up not working. Click on bitcoin and nothing happens, all links go dead.

To the layman bit just sounds like an abbreviation of bitcoin which just [adds to the confusion](
@_date: 2014-10-22 12:33:00
I looked at the code. The answer isn't quite clear cut. An [amount]( is defined as 64 bit integer.
But in the reference implementation there are [functions for formatting and parsing amounts]( These functions specifically place the decimal point where we understand it to be today, right after 1 bitcoin. 
If we were to use the 64bit int to be the Integer then there wouldn't be any value available. The formatting function ignores all values after the 8th decimal point. The value of 1 in 64bit is dust in the bitcoin reference implementation.


We would only be left with the formating's defintion of an amount. In other words 1 Bitcoin = 1 XBT.
But on the other hand I'm not convinced that the ISO 4217 makes this Integer restriction. I couldn't find a copy of it online (it seems like you have to buy it). What I read on [wikipedia]( makes me believe that It can be defined arbitrarily. The exponent could be 10^-2 or 10^-8.
EDIT: It seems that historically 1 XBT has been used to mean 1 Bitcoin, that would probably be argument enough to maintain this definition.
