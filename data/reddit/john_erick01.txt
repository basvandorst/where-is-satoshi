Why has blockstream.info become the default for wallets and exchanges replacing blockchain.info?

Why were blocks explorer one of the worst things for Bitcoin? Do you refer to privacy issues?

Every wallet you install, whether it be on a mobile phone, computer or hardware such as Ledger or Trezor, they will always have a list of all your receiving public addresses waiting to be used, for each transaction you receive, the receipt is exchanged and your receiving address is changed to another, but you can always receive at the old address normally, but you should use one address for each transaction, ie do not reuse a public address for privacy reasons as the blockchain It is open and allows any Internet user to consult a public address, for example yours. If you use an address for each transaction, it will be harder for you to track it.
This is a bank, you wouldn't show your bank statement to anyone, would you? no matter how much money you have in your bank. Just like bitcoin, nothing stops you from reusing an address, but if you don't change it and I know what your address is, even if you don't know it, I can know how many moves you made to the address through a block explorer. (ex: [blockchain.info]( Reusing an address would be the same as showing you without knowing your bank statement, but if you change the addresses (today's wallets do it yourself) it's like a bank statement for every transaction, so it's harder to track down .
Rest assured that it costs nothing for the network to generate you public addresses, use one for each situation.
