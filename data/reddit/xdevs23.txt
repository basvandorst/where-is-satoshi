I don't do a lot of trading and I own very little crypto (less than 50 €) but that might help me in the future so thanks for that.

What's the amount you can trade without getting in trouble? Would it be a problem if you e. g. bought x amount of bitcoin for $ 10 and sell that x amount for $ 12 so that you effectively make $ 2 profit? I know it isn't that much but just in theory.

Yeah, still, the IRS likes it when you don't have any losses.
Nowadays the "democracy" is done in a way that benefits the state and the rich and damages the poor.
Many people who vote don't know what they are actually voting for. I don't live in the US so I can't judge as much but in the EU, especially in Germany, that's what we've been noticing.

Wait what? So if I buy 100 € in bitcoin now, wait one year, and sell it for, let's say, 140 €, that 40 € is free of tax? 
And do I need to declare it and how? In which section of the tax declaration would that be?

That's fucked up. It's like being a slave and having to always give a part of what you earned to your master. But if you lose, master doesn't want to have anything to do with it.

Why eat, you can't repeat.

Oh that's good to know. I thought you had to declare it no matter what because it's speculation. Thanks for clarifying.
