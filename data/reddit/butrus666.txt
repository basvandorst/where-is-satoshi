Whats the point?You will have to go thru KYC when you will want to go back to cash.

So its electric poster?
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:45:47
Who uses those and why?
@_date: 2019-03-14 11:59:10
But you can do that at home on your computer or wherever on your phone....why the need for ATM...?

I used Shakepay before this incident lots of tomes too and it was all OK...until it wasnt.
The case was sooo simple to see what went wrong,but they yust would notlook into it.It was always response its all OK on our side...for six months...then all of a sudden they said you are right,sorry.But I lost money.Not them.

Back then When they had crypto to fiat debit card they managed to lost my 0,5 ETH and the rest of the ETH they managed to exchange at much lower rate then the lowest rate on any exchange at that time...I was presenting them with the historical data of exchanges but they kept ignoring it for 6 months.When they realised Im not going away ,they used exchange rate at that day(after 6 months),and ETH went from something like 900 eur to 600 in that time.They made a mistake and I lost money.They are the sort of company that keeps this space so volatile.
6 months telling me that everything is OK on their side...than confessing on their mistake,but with fuck you attitude.

It was prior to that .You guys where resolving my case for half a year.So there was time to do right.At the end you sent some funds back to me...but it was too little and to late.I payed for your mistake.Thats the end of it.I suggest people to stay away.
@_date: 2019-02-16 17:17:44
Haha...you are good at what you do.Hope you contribute it at a good cause.All best
@_date: 2019-02-15 20:53:59
It wasnt that.It all came down to exchange rate they used,which was much lower then anywhere else...much lower....I tried to get info from them from where they got their convertion rate etc but they would not disclose.It went down for 6 months like that.They replied to my emails always the same.Its all OK.At the end,they said we are sorry and wrong,you are right.But they did not make thing right.I lost money.And they where arrogant about it.Thats how it was.Stay away from Shakepay.You have been warned.

And I can see a pattern.It was the same back then...Its not us....back then their story was:Chaneglly is doing the conversion for us.But it came to that,Chaneglly only did ETH/BTC conversion.How it was converted later,Shakepay never revealed to me.So if I wanted to convert my ETH to EUR,Shakepey sent ETH to Chaneglly,and they converted it to BTC.Then Chaneglly sent that BTC to Shakepay.Thats all I found out.How Shakepey converted that BTC to EUR they would not disclose...and that conversion  rate was mistery...lower then the lowest possible...It was always Shakepay fault.Way before cards where stoped.I contacted Chaneglly...they revealed my transaction from ETH to BTC....Shakepay never revealed their doings with my money.

I strongly suggest avoiding Shakepay.Took them 6 months to resolve my case.Lost my money at the end and I did nothing wrong.Their error completely and they ignored that completely.
Mistake was made by us,but we will make you pay for it is their moto.

This was all before that.You understand that?What is your role at Shakepay?
@_date: 2019-02-16 08:49:46
I was basicly said.You are right,we are sorry,we can give some of your money back.I wanted all.They said thats it,take it or leave it.I took it ,but it was too little too late.

When quantum computer will be available to public ,things will operate differently.If not,bitcoin and its value will be the least of our problems.NOTHING would be secure...
