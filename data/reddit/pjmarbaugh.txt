That’s a great point actually. Security of crypto will definitely be a profitable business in the future. Shit, I consider myself to be above average in terms of tech proficiency but i still are protecting private keys and everything as a daunting task sometimes. So I’m a way out traditional form of banking will likely never go away. But at least now people have the capability of storing large sums efficiently all by themselves, plus all the other benefits crypto brings

Actually it was meant for that... we’ve just gone on to realize that it’s only a stepping stone to achieving that vision

I like rum, that’s what’s wrong with what you said

New lending businesses will pop up rather than the all in once place system that banks currently are. In reality, the banks we currently have will probably just begin to focus on these types of services and quit pursuing traditional banking

I mean I’m just wildly speculating as to how these types of services could be done in the future. I’m by no means an expert. But I assume investment services will still be very popular. People will still deposit money into stuff like that giving he business capital to lend to other people and do other stuff with. I also would assume that many of our current banks will fill this role. So they will have existing capital from the profits they are making now

Sorry, must have gotten it mixed up with something else. It’s hard to stay on top of all this shit. Where are you banking the hash power will move to? Bitcoin cash again?
