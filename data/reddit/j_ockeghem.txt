This is so awesome; LN will be a true game changer.
I hope the next ones to follow will be the big exchanges. The one that is first will get all my trading fees.

Well, but exchanges are in competition. If one of them would support LN - fast, trustless transactions of coins from/to the exchange - they would have a tremendous competitive advantage over exchanges that only support the slow transfer. I believe this will drive exchanges to prioritize LN support.

Looks like a good guide, great job! I can't comment on the details of the setup, as my node (ockeghem) is based on RaspiBlitz which automates most of the setup. However:


I use RTL, very nice tool. For some things I still use the command line as they are not available via RTL, e.g. opening channels with a manually specified fee for the funding transaction.

Here, as one of many options (and probably the cheapest) is a setup based on a Raspberry Pi.
It's completely self-explanatory and guides you through the whole process. I have done it myself.

Congrats! For all my amazon purchases, I am buying gift vouchers via lightning at bitrefill. Works perfectly, and I start using the network. Also got my own lightning node up and running!!

Man, this guy is already a living legend. Read his whole Twitter thread. I whole-heartedly share his sentiment:  
"I love this technology and community. I’ve found it to be deeply principled, purpose-driven, edgy, and…really weird. Just like the early internet! I’m excited to get to learn more directly."
@_date: 2019-03-06 11:50:15


Isn't this the fee for the funding transaction?
@_date: 2019-03-09 18:02:59
AFAIK it should be no different on a Raspberry Pi than anywhere else. And since it's developed by the same group (lightninglabs), neutrino and lnd should work nicely together. But it's still not recommended for mainnet.

I do all my shopping with amazon gift cards bought via bitrefill (using lightning network). Not affiliated with them, but want to support this!
I first choose the country (Germany) and then buy the amazon gift cards for this country. I am not sure if the codes would be transferrable between different amazon country pages.

Not using the RaspiBlitz I mentioned above: LND and Bitcoin Core are pre-installed on the Raspberry image (no unfulfilled dependencies). I honestly don't know how it can get any simpler than that.
There's also Pierre Rochard's node launcher, which (though I haven't tried it myself) also seems to be extremely easy, judging from the feedback on Twitter.

Anyone knows if this will also come to Starbucks in Europe?

You have two alternative options to set the rate in lncli openchannel and closechannel
\--conf\_target\_value or, alternatively, --sat\_per\_byte

Jack wouldn't do that (although the name would be cool ;)). He is the anti-Zuck. He has mentioned on many occasions that he thinks there will be a native currency for the internet and that he hopes it will be bitcoin. He also invested in lightning labs and announced lightning integration into Cash App is not a question of "if", but rather "when".

RaspiBlitz already has two mobile wallets supported out of the box. I guess there are others, but I haven't looked. 
Alternatively (that's the way I do it right now), though less elegant, you can always do instant transfers of small amounts to a custodian mobile lightning wallet (e.g. bluewallet) from your own lightning node.

Wah, thanks! This is so cool. Sending 1024 to you this way:
!lntip 1024
@_date: 2019-02-21 01:29:16
Aww, thank you! It's there, so cool!
I'm also using bluewallet right now, as it's the only option for iOS so far.
But I also want to try and setup my own node using Pierre Rochard's node launcher, which, apparently, is quite straightforward and even allows running a lightning node using only a pruned blockchain. 
Let me try and do this one here for the 1st time:
!lntip 42

I just sent my first couple of tips using "tippin". With the browser extension, you see the tippin symbol next to each tweet. And when you get some tips sent to you, you can see from which tweet they were sent.
Wow, this could really be a killer app in driving further lightning adoption. It certainly got me on board :)
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:30:54
Same for me! It's so damn cool.
@_date: 2019-02-20 23:34:08
Done! Enjoy a nice dinner :) 
@_date: 2019-02-21 12:16:13
Ah, I have to refill! Just paid the invoice.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:36:24
Chris Giancarlo for president!!!
@_date: 2019-01-25 11:57:54
I have downloaded but not tried it out yet, supposedly it's the first iOS wallet support lightning without having to install your own node. Anyone else has tried it out yet?
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:43:20
Following. One of my heroes, after this senate hearing for the history books!
@_date: 2017-09-01 17:03:04
I sold during the last few days. This will come down hard.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:35:03
I tuned into this hearing not expecting much beyond the transcripts. And then for the first time I hear this passionate and open-minded man, Chris Giancarlo. I will never forget these moments; literally had tears in my eyes – "and by the way I'm not a pie-in-the-sky dreamer". Legendary.
@_date: 2018-02-06 22:40:47
Chris Giancarlo, visionary crypto evangelist and warm-hearted dad! His kids and niece should be so proud of him.
@_date: 2018-02-06 18:42:00
He even used the word HODL, mentioned that without bitcoin there would be no blockchain technology, and that it could be used to bank the unbanked – and that his kids have bitcoin. I love this guy, he seems an awesome and interesting person.
@_date: 2019-05-04 22:55:17
Indeed. It's so easy these days, from out-of-the-box solutions like Casa Hodl, Nodl etc., to extremely low-cost solutions like running on a Raspberry Pi. I'm running a full node and lightning (lnd) node using this Raspberry Pi distribution, can highly recommend and rootzoll is very responsive on Twitter (maybe also active here?). He is even providing amazon shopping lists for several countries.
