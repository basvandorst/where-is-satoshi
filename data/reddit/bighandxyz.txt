Being victims of scams or greed have costs plenty of livelihoods. Human greed knows no bound, a non-regulated market in financials, environmental, or anything else will always end up hurting the population in the long run.
The great depression was literally the result of banks and stock market being completely un-regulated. When it was bought to public's attention in the 20s, people were diving head fists in there that ends up completely wiping out the average folk's savings years later.
Our recent crisis was also caused by irresponsible mortgage lending, faulty categorizing the CDOs, and changes to leverage rule in 2004 from 12-1 to unlimited. Banks were leveraged to extreme level that falls like domino if anything goes wrong.
Regulations are meant to stop similar tragedies from happening in the future.

We can already greatly increase CC security and reduce fraud, but all security measures comes at a price; In US, usability &gt; security. Why would your average customers use bitcoin over CC when its shown that people are fine to pay extra for the conveniences? A 3-D Secure protocol will wipe out all the low level thefts, frauds from all merchants data breach, and fraudulent charge-back, all for a simple 4 digit input. But people simply don't sign up for the protection and would actually hurt companies that forcefully implement it as the main payment method. It is mostly used for gold/silver sellers and gambling co. Call it Commoner's Dilemma or whatever you will.
Spending money we don't have is also part our culture, and it is also the backbone of our economy. CC are quick, short term loans is a role that bitcoin will never be able to fulfill.

Now you're just grasping at straws. CC makes most of its revenue &amp; profit from outstanding charges and debts. To put it simply they are loan sharks that sucks on people who can't manage their finance. In fact, CC only generates about 20% of their revenue from merchants, and probably a low margin sector at that due to maintenance costs.
And that isn't going to change any time soon. On the contrary, just about all CC companies are making record profits and is expected to make deep footing in international countries. CC spending is growing and expected to grow at 14% annually in China until 2020. You will never not have enough suckers that needs quick and easy money.

Securities is often a direct trade off with usability. Verified by Visa processes  are very secure for consumers and retailers, but customers don't want to deal with that shit so it is very rarely used (Mostly for gold/silver purchases and online gambling sites)

BABA business model is drastically different from those of AMZN and Ebay, fyi. BABA is more similar to google than it is to AMZN.
AMZN problem is that it makes zero profit, and has not for over a decade. The company itself is unwilling to open its books regarding specific spending and expenses and unwilling cooperation are things that will be heavily penalized by investors.


And you pull this number out of where? Their revenue is $8 billion as of early 2013 on the world second largest economy (AMZN is approaching $100 billion in comparison).

No it's not. First off it's a bit difficult to get the wrong address, and there is a brief period of time where reversing the transfer is possible. Your banks also can obtained detailed information about the recipient where you may take legal actions whereas you're 99.99% SOL if you transfer to an unknown bitcoin address.


Because that doesn't matter to the context at hand. When I wire money from bank, I don't have to trust how secured is my machine or that my IT guy is capable. I wouldn't trust myself holding large number of bitcoins either, and I am a CS graduate.


Not my problem. Errors on their end is reimbursed to me

Bitcoin is an investment vehicle. They are very comparable and suspect-able to human nature.

Theoretically, but we never had a truly deflationary market to start with. 
We only have studies for the effects of a deflationary spiral, and it certainly is not pretty.
Contracts that adjust for deflation is one that decrease costs (aka wages) given all things equal. In the normal market, wages do adjust to inflation abeit it lags a few years. It is fair to assume the reverse is true in the theoretical deflationary market.

It's not that hard to Google. 
You're talking about an era where companies knew there were serious problems with their cars but would rather let people die in them anyway then to do recalls. "Cost benefit analysis" at work, see "Pinto Fire Controversy".
Car safety was not a selling point in the 60s, many cars did not have seatbelts and they were deemed as unnecessary costs by corporations. So yes, seat belts on all automobile were a direct result of political push for government regulations on the automobile industry. And companies like Ford and GM have fought hard against many of these policies,
"Henry Ford II famously argued that implementation of federal safety requirements for automobiles (including lap and shoulder seat belts) would force his eponymous company to “close down.”

Because poorest of the poor in first world aren't exactly that poor relatively. Our standard of living is quite high, but that is a direct result of generations of good old hard working American, improvements, advanced educations, and good policies that directed us at the right path.
We wouldn't be where we are today without free educations for the masses. Countries without accessible education system are the saddest of the bunch
By the 1870, US had one of the highest literacy rates. This is not a coincidence, but a direct result of free public education implementation and other education reforms on all states. 


"emergencies" aka you're already dying. That is not healthcare, that's just patching whatever is left of you up. 


They would be allowed, unless they are unfortunate. Must be because they are failures at lives and aren't working hard enough, right?


Yeah, lets progressively go back hundred of years ago where people live in remote villages. Urbanization and industrialization are the natural and essential steps to progress where we are today.
It is frightening how many in this sub thinks it would be a good idea to eradicate free educations and security for the masses.

Firefighters and police would have to collect hefty fees if it were a private entity, and of no service to you or your area if it does not reach the profit threshold.

I agree one of the major flaws in patents is the costs, and its something we can vastly improved upon.
Though patents in general are in favor for small business. Having patent vastly improves your chance of getting venture capital funds and helps defend your firm from competitors from simply taking your ideas. Lawsuits against small firms are simply unprofitable, and in firm that gets on their radar have means to defend themselves.
The patent system is far from perfect, but abolishing it outright is simply shortsighted.

Here is simple logic behind it by Warren Buffet.
“The economy, as measured by gross domestic product, can be expected to grow at an annual rate of about 3 percent over the long term, and inflation of 2 percent would push nominal GDP growth to 5 percent, Buffett said. Stocks will probably rise at about that rate and dividend payments will boost total returns to 6 percent to 7 percent, he said.”

What you're saying is far too out-fetched. The decrease in tax revenue would be so minor that it is not going to cause war or even breaking down countries.
First majority of people are not going to bother with Bitcoin. A shocking number of people still does not know how to print screen on their computer. Second it'll reach an equilibrium at some point, it will not grow indefinitely. Lastly it has no backing of physical entity (This has its advantage and disadvantage; we live in a physical world afterall).
Honestly, it is also not that hard to "ban" Bitcoin if any countries wanted to. For example, a heavy fines would kill most merchant from adoption; thus losing mass appeals. For a more totalitarian approach, a simple jail time would completely cripple its usage and growth. For financial, impose a high tax fee among exchanges will also cripple its usage. Nobody would convert their salaries to bitcoin if it means incurring, for instance, 30% tax.


Fluctuating "currencies" are dangerous. What goes up quick, comes down just as quickly. Nobody wants to be the bagger, and for many business institutes they are here for safe, passive revenue. Any risks are not tolerable
Currencies are simply medium of exchange; Nothing more, nothing less.

Per transaction. Riot deals with thousands of transaction a day. Either bitpay/coinbase service needs to have sufficient funds to cover these transactions, or there will be delay until it can acquire enough funding. If anything, delay is inevitable (regulations, fundings, etc)


But the difference is bitcoin is absolutely worthless to Merchants like Amazon. They cannot pay dividend, wages, or taxes with them. They will need to convert all their bitcoins as soon as they receive them, generating additional risks. Being a volatile surely does not help either.


Are we talking about short term or long term? Speculation is going to drive bitcoin values up, but having major merchants and corporations converting all their (bitcoin) assets on a minute basis surely cannot be healthy for bitcoins at its current stage. Keep in mind the price going up or down is irrelevant, major companies needs stability in their transactions.


I understand bitcoin is a seller heaven. Once bitcoin is through, its through. Under credit and debt system, merchants and consumers can provide proofs of purchases or proof or deliveries, and frauds can be chased down. Not so much can be done with bitcoins if you are the buyer.

US will never take BTC as a payment for its jets or military protection; This is the strength of having an entity backed by a currency, for example. There is also nothing fundamentally superior about exchanging with BTC over traditional currencies. They are both simply a mean of exchange, if anything BTC instability carries far too much risks as a medium of exchange.
You're also implying people who uses bitcoin would tax invade, maybe for minor transactions but this isn't something that large merchants and transactions can get away with.
Even in the alternative universe where money laundering becomes a serious issue, I have offered multiple ways for any countries to "shut down" bitcoin within their territory.
BTC also has a ton of problems on its own that ensures it will never reach the kind of global acceptance you're describing. But I feel that is for another discussion.

Bitpay makes the process automatic and "safer", but still poses risks and does not solve the volatility/liquidity problem.
What I understand is bitcoin locks the transaction for 15 minute, and they have front end cash + fees to "take a loss or gain" when fluctuation happens. But as transaction needed to settle the cash grows, the higher the risk it becomes.  
I am sure they have a system in place where they can refuse to process your order when things comes tumbling down, and merchants will just have to take the loss. Or bitpay itself can bankrupt from the losses
May not be a big deal for small merchants though.
