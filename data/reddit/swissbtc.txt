Yep. But how could that happen with Germany ?!
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:33:06
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:34:13
Yep. I'll definitely do that. Thing is on Bitstamp's website is written that it shall give no fees with a SEPA payment.
Do people who withdraw money from outside Ukraine don't have this problem at all ?
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:31:07
For this one I have a great story. Thank you helping me pointing it out for a nice TIFU.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:51:24
Nope. SEPA transfer is only available in EUR. Therefor, it was in EUR. My bank is changing the CHF from my account to EUR, and this service I shall pay for. But when I enter the quantity I want to transfer, it is in EUR.
And again, first sentence of the wiki page ;


[And it was a European country (Ukraine) which took the fees.](
Edit: Ouch, this one hurts. Ukraine is not in Europe. But someone pointed out their bank is in Slovenia. Same stuff. Must check to whom I made this payment.

Oh come on... You want to see his hairy ass, don't you ?!
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:33:40
Wait.... What ? How does that make any sense ?
It's like saying : " Hey, let's adopt something that we won't be able to use"
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:05:15
Reiffeissen Ukraine.
Edit : Must verify. Had that in mind, but's maybe not true...
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:37:18
Nope, you're wrong. The rules of my bank are clear : they will only charge the 0.30CHF for the transfer. And they can't control what's the incoming bank is doing.
I made like 10 SEPA transfers past year to my brother who lives in Germany, never had this kind of fees.
Made a transfer to a friend who live in Germany past week, he got the outrageous fees.
@_date: 2015-01-27 18:41:01
Gonna take some time to write (ob English bla bla...)
@_date: 2015-01-27 20:38:06
Thank you kind stranger !
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:02:32
You Sir, you made my day !
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:41:30
That's one hell of a good question !
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:53:04
Somewhere I wrote that I made a payment to a friend in Germany who had to pay fees (like 10 or 15 euros) a week ago, but I also made like 10 payment for my brother who lives in Germany too (different bank), and he had no fees to pay.
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:38:06
Holy ***** !!!!
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:46:59
Need to show a pic of your ass holding the receipt as proof !

First sentence of the provided link :


@_date: 2015-01-27 13:11:33
I'm sure it was a SEPA order. It's pretty easy with UBS ebanking.
As said I've made it with my brother in Germany, and it worked perfectly (about 10 time past year), and one time last week with a friend also in Germany (different bank), and he got the fees.
@_date: 2015-01-27 15:04:05


pfiouuuuu, glad to live in Switzerland... :]
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:47:50
Exactly ! Thanks dude.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:56:30
Perfectly Sir !
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:19:07
Yep, you're definitely right. I just want to know if I misunderstood something, or if the bank are screwing us (HaHa!).
In my opinion, it's Exchanges who should fight against their bank to get it right. 'Cause 15 bucks on 10000 EUR is not so much fees, but on $100 ?
I think 10 guys buying $10000 worth bitcoin is not so powerful as 10000 guys buying worth $10 bitcoin. 
@_date: 2015-01-27 10:33:45
I totally agree with the fact that this is one of the best example explaining why the bitcoin where made, It's why they're so amazing.
But how can you "buy" bitcoin without an exchange and your bank ? Localbitcoin meaning paying 5% fees ? Ok, these won't go to a bank, which is nice, but I'm a customer, and therefor I unfortunately always look where it's the cheapest.
edit : maid is not made...and other stuff
@_date: 2015-01-27 14:56:43
Oho, nice to know. I have to try it !
Edit : [mmmmmm.](
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:29:05
Thanks for the link !
3-5% fees is a bit to high for me (assuming they apply same fees as for a direct exchange)... Ok, these guy have to win something, but again, that's the paradox with this whole stuff.
Let's hope one day only bitcoins will survive :]
@_date: 2015-01-27 13:24:30
I was afraid to say it...
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:45:38
The question is; is it Bitstamp or Bitstamps bank (Reiffeissen Ukrain) ?
@_date: 2015-01-27 16:35:53
Nothing. You can smoke whatever you want at home (or at your buddies home). Police will never have the right of entering your home just for smoking weed.
@_date: 2015-01-27 12:55:46
It was the Bitstamps bank (Raffeissen Ukraine) who charged the fees.
And for the transfer to my friend in Germany, it was his bank...
@_date: 2019-12-23 07:56:32
Yup. It's a well known fact that rfid was there way before the $100 bills.
@_date: 2019-12-30 11:01:13
Well documented article. I find it interesting because it is, in my opinion, one realistic scenario. Not a "price will be 1 zillion Dollars in 2 months because my cat said so (and I also burnt some sage which smoke pattern said the same)" scenario.
Guys, we need more of this kind of well thought stuff if we want to attract "serious" people.
Props to the disclaimer also.
@_date: 2019-12-20 08:38:25
My idea was more like using BTC directly at the store (when and if the time come).
Of course, if it hits a certain price and it's still not accepted in my grocery store (just an example), I may cash out one third of my holdings for security reasons.
Again this is all theory and I think it will take years to come to this point.
Edit: I meant the store accepting BTC without the use of a third party. I obviously should have been more specific.
@_date: 2019-12-21 13:37:29
Muahaha. I like you.
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:07:23
Sorry for you loss dude.
@_date: 2019-05-18 12:05:18
Remember minitel ? :)
@_date: 2013-11-22 06:46:45
Congrats ! You make Bitcoins becoming such amazing !!
@_date: 2013-11-22 08:09:01
Login is ok right now, but my account verification is tacking toooooooo much time... (ok, sent Tuesday, but still tooooooo looooong)
And of course no answer from support... 
Edit : it's done now.
Weeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee 
@_date: 2013-11-20 16:09:30
Same here... 3 fails and waiting for the last (hopefully the good) one since a few days :o
@_date: 2013-11-19 19:18:02
Would it make sense to have a Swiss based exchange server / provider ?
