@_date: 2019-10-08 07:23:31

Personally I often use Skrill but on CoinDeal you have a huge variety of paying methods so you can choose the best for you. You need to register and verify your account first.

@_date: 2019-09-24 09:53:53
I think that not only Bitcoin is profitable, altcoins like XRP or LTC are promising as well and we need to remember that. Of course that it's not worth investing in the less well-known altcoins, many of them aren't worth any money. 
In reference to the Galaxy Score, it's more helpful than I thought at the beginning. And I can say it as a quite experienced trader. So, I definitely can recommend it.
@_date: 2019-09-03 06:16:18
