Bitcoin transactions don't have a "sender". They have a list of inputs and a list of outputs.
There would be even more people who don't understand change bitching about the wrong address showing up in the "sender" field, and multiple addresses showing up there.

Why does BTC-E still have a chat box?
It makes the website look rather unprofessional, and to be honest, is a cancerous shit hole.

I think it would be better if it was somehow IRC based. With channels, ignore command, etc.

You're right, I accidentally copied the number from the wrong country (Rwanda).
I fixed it now.
