Who cares if it breaks through 7k...

Nice.  So, think about it like this, you've got a nice amount in.  If you look at long-term charts and see how thing thing likes to balloon, I would actually be excited to be in your position.

That's conservative.  You got me beat my a long shot.  :)  Gotta keep the woman happy.
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:52:30
Nice.  Definitely more encouraging looking at long-term charts.

And a million dollars worth of knowledge.

Take a more conservative path and consider more things.

Lots of newbies getting in cheap putting more money in than they normally could at one time.  I wonder how this will effect the price?  Disclaimer I'm a noob myself. 
I mean, not that I watched (I had work), but I read there were mentions of BTC in commercials and such during the Superbowl.

And I can get in cheaper, that'd be great.

Have you liquidated your possessions or do you still hold bitcoin?
@_date: 2018-02-05 17:28:45
I've known about bitcoin for many years but only started investing in it when I heard about its gains in recent months.  Now, like others, I'm borderline obsessed with it.
So, as you've probably figured out, I've "lost" money since getting in.  However, I haven't sold off my investment, and I'm not trading on a margin.
Here's the weirdest thing about it.  I'm not just investing, I'm learning.  Even though my portfolio has lost value, I feel richer in a sense, because I was never able to save money in the past and now I'm actually holding onto a chunk of something.  Also, experience has taught me that there is no such thing as wasted time.  You can learn from everything, both good and bad aspects.
I'm a bullish noob.  I hold onto an asset that has recently lost value but has this amazing long term history of growth.  I'm kind of starting to understand the weak hands, strong hands concept.
These are a noobs two cents.

Anyone married or in LTRs investing in BTC?  How does your partner feel about it?

Something lost is something gained?  
Did said hypothetical buddy sell his btc back for dollars and lock in the loss?
Sentiment seems to change day to day on this beast.
