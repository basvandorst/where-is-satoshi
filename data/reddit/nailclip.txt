Block reward * current price / avg number of transactions a day
(3600*$250)/120000 = $7.5
Essentially, miners are currently paid $7.5 for every transaction.

Yes I would argue that the top 1% owns more than 50% of bitcoin wealth. Satoshi has 10%. Roger Ver has 100k coins. Winkle bros also own a significant number. Who knows how much all the core devs own? So unless you can prove to me that the top 1% doesn't own more than 50% of total bitcoin wealth, you can't say that bitcoin is better for equality.

Why? This is another piece of software designed to mitigate a fundamental problem with bitcoin. It is certainly very innovative and all that, but how are they going to monetize? The company is probably venture funded at the moment so there are likely no fees, but that can't last forever. When there are fees, it will likely be passed on to the merchant, which makes it no different than Visa or MasterCard. 
Gotta love bitcoin...always solving problems that people don't have  if they just used a credit card.

You still have to recognize that even if their reserves/users 10x in the next year, they would have still only made $6000 from their proposed 1% fee, and that's only when people cash out.

I would see what kind of spread a local bank can offer you while you are there. In the countries I've been to, I've seen spreads of 1% to 8%. If it's on the lower end of that range, I don't think BTC will save you much money, especially if you want to convert it back to USD immediately because you will have to pay fees getting pesos into BTC and then more fees converting BTC back to USD.

I designed this software. Basically, it's like the best security software ever. Once you used this, only ONE person in the world can get access to your files. So of course I wanted to share this with everyone I knew. I sent a trial version to a lot of different people. But see, I also had to monetize this right? So then I had an option for them to pay me in Bitcoin or they can't access their files.
If they do pay, next year, I will go back and sell them more software. If not, fuck them, they will be out of business anyways since if they don't care about their files. This is not stealing.

I honestly don't see ATMs as a viable business model at the moment. There just isn't enough volume. By the time adoption picks up, there might very well be a new model that's faster and more user friendly. Most BTC users are pretty tech savvy so I would rather just use Coinbase or Circle. There isn't any occasion where I need Bitcoins so urgently that I would run to an ATM.

The benefit is purely on the merchant side though. I think OP is asking why normal consumers should use BTC. You might say that merchants will pass savings onto consumers, but they might easily just add it to their own profits, whereas if you use a CC, you at least get some rewards back.

My rational expectation is that bitcoin will not be widely adopted by consumers. In most places in the world, people just do not need another payments methods, especially one that provides merchants all of the benefits. That said, I believe that bitcoin does have a lot of utility when it comes to remittances or large bank-to-bank transfers. For that to work, however, prices will have to stabilize, or at least guaranteed by one party until the transfer is complete. This might not work either because once bitcoin becomes a big enough competition to banks/Western Union, they might just lower fees/implement faster transfers to squeeze out BTC. 
I don't have very good expectations for the price of bitcoin, unfortunately. This might equal automatic downvotes, but because the bitcoin market has become more rational, it has become more and more unlikely that an average person will 10x their money. This type of extraordinary return is needed for any investor who is willing to bear the type of risk that bitcoin offers. It's kind of like offering better odds to bet on an underdog, but the odds that bitcoin is offering is getting worse and worse. 
You might cite all of the good news in the past year as a way to disprove my points, but the good news has not made the price pop. Before 2014, it had been that if merchant adoption increased, bitcoin prices would pop, but it didn't. Then, it was said that if it was easy to buy bitcoins with a credit card, adoption will sky-rocket, but that hasn't happened either. It's becoming clear that infrastructure is not a major barrier to adoption.

I don't see this being overly successful. Cart abandonment is already a huge problem for most online retailers. Even if people see this discount, it's not like they can instantly take advantage of it because any newcomer to Bitcoin would have to get it through Circle or Coinbase, and it takes several days to get your account up and running.

What the banker is describing is exactly what Ripple is for...or am I wrong about that? I don't really see these types of transactions go through BTC unless there is some way to guarantee/stabilize price.

That article doesn't disprove the deflation theory as bitcoin is currently in INFLATION since new coins continue to be mined. Bitcoin will only be deflationary in the future.

Yeah it's possible, but there are a lot of hoops to jump through for the customer. Even if the buyer already has bitcoin, he/she might not have ChangeTip set up. With ChangeTip set up, the buyer basically has to trust that you will deliver the goods since the payment is one-way with (at the moment) no way of reversing it. ChangeTip is also limited to $25 for most users. Withdrawing from ChangeTip is going to eventually incur a 1% fee, and that's not even considering the fee to convert btc back to fiat. So yeah, CT is not really meant for eCommerce.

Almost any BTC company can be replaced with fiat and no one will know the difference. They don't add any additional demand for bitcoin. 
For example:
Bitpay is just Visa, but only for bitcoin. Only benefits people who already has bitcoin; no reason to buy bitcoin just to use Bitpay. 
ChangeTip is just an internal ledger that spits out bitcoin whenever you want to. You can still tip micro amounts in fiat and then just withdraw once you get to a certain amount.
Gyft already accepts CC and again, bitcoin is becoming a smaller portion of its total revenue. 
@_date: 2015-03-06 04:37:36
Here's an idea that I've been thinking about lately. I travel internationally quite frequently, enough that I pay $100+ in annual fees for a Visa card with no foreign transaction fees. I usually end up saving more money than the annual fee but I don't always travel enough to make up that difference. 
Instead, what I would really want to see is a bitcoin company that puts up kiosks in major international airports that convert your bitcoin into whatever debit/credit card that the locals use. Basically, I would be able to use my bitcoins as a collateral/funding source and draw from my funds using the local debit/credit card. This way, I can avoid foreign transaction fees and do not have to carry a large sum of cash. 
The company would still need to convert my btc into local currency for their own operations but at least with btc, they are not dealing with 10+ foreign currencies. 
@_date: 2015-03-02 17:15:53
With respect, I don't think this information is accurate at all. Credit card companies and the banks that issue them make money from transaction fees and interest from your outstanding balance. Your credit card is "free" for you since you pay it all in full every month, but many people do carry a balance. I don't really buy the argument that Bitcoin protects your privacy. You might not be giving information to Visa, but Bitpay or Coinbase still has all of your purchasing info. In addition, the online retailers also have your home address and other information as well. 
In my opinion, the privacy advantage of Bitcoin is only realized through peer-to-peer transactions (i.e. I send you $200 in BTC to your wallet address).

@_date: 2013-06-02 06:32:42
All automated sentiment analysis uses natural language processing. My guess is that if the tweet has the word Bitcoin or BTC and the positive words like great, awesome, or amazing, it would be rated positively. Generally, this is not very accurate since someone could say, "Holy shit, I just used BTC to buy sushi!" and it would likely to be rated as negative sentiment. Some programs do this better than others, of course. 
Regardless, for a niche topic like bitcoins, you can expect sentiment to be largely positive since only enthusiasts or those in the industry would be tweeting about BTCs on a consistent basis. I wouldn't think many people would be blasting BTC on Twitter because unless they have a techy audience, no one would care. 
Social media VOC is probably a better metric. Here's a chart.
As you can see, VOC spiked around April 12, close to when the last bubble was. In fact, VOC and price in the past 6 months are roughly matching up. I wouldn't speculate on the cause and effect, but just interesting.

Competition from other crypto-currencies will ultimately doom Bitcoin. People on this subreddit only focus on the positive aspects of BTC, but don't realize that it is still a system that is incredibly difficult for the vast majority of the public to adopt. The iPod was not the first mp3 player, but it was certainly the most user-friendly.

Because price to 110 was a pump to begin with.
@_date: 2013-07-01 19:19:26
BTC is slowly stabilized to its actual price before the boom. While there's been some innovation and increase in adoption in the 5 month period since it was around $35 USD, it didn't justify an almost 400% increase in price when BTC fluctuated around $120-130 USD earlier. I think most rational people could see this. I'm guessing certain speculators are seeing this as well and are cashing out now.

The U.S. is one of the best countries to start a small business. Depending on where your business is located, there's often very few barriers to entry. You don't have to bribe any officials or curry favors from the local government. All you need to do is file the proper paperwork and pay taxes. That's a fucking luxury compared to situations in other countries.

Easy. For most people, BTC IS a scam, in that it has no apparent advantage over fiat.
Let's look outside this whole Bitcoin bubble for a second. What purpose does BTC serve for 99% of the general population? It's very technical, accepted in few places, and a pain to buy. In my everyday life, I can buy almost anything I want with cash and a credit card. Why would I use this alternative currency just for the sake of using it? Some might argue that BTC is a hedge against inflation, but guess what else is a hedge against inflation? Every other type of investment option out there, and each with much much less risk than BTC. 
So yeah, why would the general public bother to even understand BTC?

That's exactly what's happening. I think this shows the continual pressure to convert BTC to USD from businesses who accept BTC and miners. This is actually a really bad sign because businesses are effectively losing a certain percentage with every BTC by selling it on Bitstamp at a depressed rate.

See, this line of reasoning just doesn't make sense. Why would an economic collapse trigger an increase in Bitcoin usage? Historically, when the market crashes, people shift their portfolio to include MORE stable investments. At the current moment, Bitcoin is at a non-investment, purely speculative level of risk. 
How do you see it reaching $1000 or $20,000 but not $600,000? There is absolutely zero reasoning behind your statements except that you wish it to be true so that you can "retire early".

Rough translation:
1. Chinese government is not currently aware of Bitcoin.
1. CCTV's coverage of BTC is only entertainment and does not reflect the attitude of the government.
3. Chinese citizens welcome BTC, but the Chinese government do not.
4. Chinese citizens value Bitcoin because of its independence and personal empowerment.
5. Because Bitcoin has escaped the attention of the Chinese government, it is very convenient to exchange for Bitcoins in China. You can exchange Bitcoins in certain hotels, for example. 
6. Very few Chinese citizens trade on Mt. Gox because of its inconvenience and costly fees. 
7. The Chinese government will definitely clamp down on BTCs as soon as it recognize the value of BTC.
8. Chinese people don't understand why the U.S. is clamping down on BTCs. Is it just because of money laundering concerns? I thought the U.S government protect personal freedom and rights? 
9. The recent actions by the U.S. government towards BTC is very discouraging to Chinese citizens.

I'm guessing what your trader friend means is that you shouldn't sit on one asset for too long, just waiting for it to go up when you can use your money to invest in something with more movement. That's how traders think but whether you agree is up to you. 
That said, the attitude of just "hoping to get back to even" is a dangerous one to have. I'm guessing that you can't afford to lose the entirety of your initial investment? If so, I would reevaluate your position.

Except not every single banking or financial problem can be solved by Bitcoin. Banks shutting down in Cyprus gave Bitcoin a PR boost, but no one is able to come up with the number of people in Cyprus who actually adopted Bitcoins. The main reason is that it is INCREDIBLY difficult for the average non-technical person to actually obtain Bitcoins with fiat and often has to take a major hit in fees both during the deposit and during the withdrawal. 
At the moment, Bitcoin is purely a first-world anarchist fantasy and not relevant to financial issues in most countries. In fact, most countries would be MORE THAN HAPPY if they could have the stability and trust of the US dollar. Stop recommending it as a solution for everything.

You might think that guy is an outlier, but he expresses a lot of concerns that I have. For one, his point about Bitcoin being a currency of privilege is absolutely true. Countries in distress is very unlikely to adopt Bitcoins, because for the most part Bitcoin is a much much less stable currency than USD. Yet, every few days, we see something about another country and how Bitcoin will solve their inflation. If you actually look at the volume and liquidity of the Bitcoin, you can see that there's actually declining demand for Bitcoin, not enough to absorb the glut of coins from mining. 
History might be full of geniuses that are ridiculed, but it is also full of Enrons and Dot Com busts. There's not enough active discussion about the risks of Bitcoin. Rather, people like you just make the argument that haters = ignorant.

This shows that you don't understand the world of finance at all. It's a great looking chart that shows nothing important. The surge since 2008 is just an accounting change that the Fed made. Even traders suspicious of the Fed don't view this as one of the shady examples.
