We hope we can create new and broader decision-making mechanisms that will allow more people to participate in Bitcoin development. [NoCORE] Action launches now, hoping Bitcoin community to get back the development review right monopolized by the Core team. Consent please sign.

Everyone can add the code,but Core can deny Everyone, that is centralized.when you want to be a btc miner ,no one can stop you ,that is decentralized.
Ethereum can finish confirm transaction in 2 minutes,  Core program is too bad and less progress
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:59:44
you are right ,but no proof mining centralized hurt BTC experience.
but development  centralized made btc worse and worse in several years.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:34:17
I think bitcoin is no a thing about nationality.
I never care about my nationality or race when I buy BTC or BCC.
I think it is so ridiculous  when a bitcoiner talk about Racism
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:43:44
Who can stop Core do good job?
Only them self.
The current problem of BTC is slow confirmation.
No miners.
so many guys  pretend not know that because they are liars
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:39:17
No, I am very good investors ,I get 2500% profit from BTC and  300% profit from BCH, I think I will get more from BCH even in this year.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:25:44
In exchange platform, sell or buy bitcoin need not real transaction on the chain.
Do you really not know that ?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:44:41
BCH miners have mine BCH in a loss for last 15 days except yesterday ,how to explain it ?
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:41:01
That means you agree development centralization.
Then why you opposite  mining centralization?
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:47:16
BTC price perhaps will drop in short time.
but never die.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:45:21
you can say your logic and reason ,not only scold.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:49:54
No one can say he is right, BTC will choose it's own success way.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:27:54
I am reasonable and in peace.
I invest in BTC and BCH. 
I really get very good benefits from both of them.
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:07:28
Worse transfer fees and worse speed.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:22:40
Yes, they will mine  most profitable chain and then sell it to balance the loss of BT2 chain. Just like I mentioned in this article
@_date: 2017-10-28 19:09:23
Yes,the current most problem is development centralized .
Not miners centralized because miner win by their high tech
@_date: 2017-10-30 00:04:21
hahaha, the number of developers is the biggest?  codes lines is the biggest?
But if Core team quit ,Bitcoin will be the biggest open source project from any side.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:41:06
No, Core is not BTC, No one attack BTC.
some body just disagree Core.
@_date: 2017-10-25 22:39:01
first it is easy to expend btc block ,just your guys mentioned ,BCH  just have on developer still can finish the codes and deploy it in several days.
I agree with you it take time to update nodes ,but not several years .
@_date: 2017-10-28 18:01:24
Just I have told ,Bitcoin is a protocol ,not a software.
@_date: 2017-10-22 18:58:58
stupid guys like some bodies  lead them.
but BTC need not leaders.
The worst thing is Core want to lead BTC  industry .
They send some liars attack any one not like them.
But they will fail and BTC price will too the moon without them
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:29:44
I think you still can be rich in future even have 0.1 btc
@_date: 2017-10-23 14:24:32
They steel  fork coin, what 's a shame!!!
I think they will lose users.
If 2x chain win ,how can they face to their users?
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:42:39
I dont think so ,that will be a new start of bitcoin.
miners  are full competition market.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:51:13
That is true ,you can find the proof in blockchair.com
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:08:56
thank you for your patience to type so many,but you still not answer my question. I dont care about the moral of Core though I think they haven't.
My question is why Core dont agree to expend the size of btc block when the block is full and transaction become slow, even it is very easy to be done .
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:36:00
You will see more and more proof of my prediction.
I am sure of that.
@_date: 2017-10-29 01:43:02
the plan start more quick than I predict.
You dont know the big miners can bear a  short time loss, even very 
big loss.
@_date: 2017-10-25 21:03:39
You are right,Bitcoin needs immutable,but you dont know which part of  Bitcoin  should be immutable.
Bitcoin protocol use same bytes for per transaction, so fixed block size can only store limited transaction records. When the block is full, the new transaction have to wait for the next block. Once the transaction backlog occurs, the expansion of block becomes a reasonable option. This is a simple truth, and this is mentioned by Satoshi.
If you use the lightning network technology ,it does not actually reduce the size of the transaction  space, just put a part of the transaction in the second layer. Thus kill the basic data structure of bitcoin: complete transaction list..
I've been a programmer for twenty years. Simple and strong codes is the most reliable, which is the consensus of the program community. This is the greatness of the Satoshi invention:blockchain, which use the most simple data structure to solve the problem of trust. If the data structure change into a multilayer, the codes become complexity in the exponential growth level, the stability and availability of the code become worst. This is the basic knowledge of the program community, what is debatable?
So it is stupid to modify the data structure of bitcoin. It's a major breach of the bitcoin protocol.

A bad news
Unfair decision
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:53:13
We need to talk about two decentralization, first, to decentralize the miners ; second, to decentralize the developers.
When it comes to the decentralization of the miners, the present miners distribution is the result of full competition. no power can stop anyone to join in the competition of  mine industry.
The Chinese miners win this game because of their technology and cost management. As long as the rules are fair, the short-term centralization has no bad effect. There's no other crypto currency that can rival the calculation power of bitcoin, and that's the best proof of good competition. 
Let's look at the decentralization of development.
First look at the development schedule, bitcoin developped first, now bitcoin’s development schedule is far behind other competing crypto currencies. Compared with the development progress of the Ethereum, I see 10 times more than the Core team's job.
Core team are good at argue with miners and organize attacks on the media, but do  a few on development. Core team here is the monopoly, to prevent the development of bitcoin evolution, They are cancer of  bitcoin industry. With This progress of development, the core team still  put on a heroic appearance, did they graduate from the Film Academy?
@_date: 2017-10-23 15:03:06
Because BTC is too famous ,have no relationship with Core.
If Core leave BTC or only one development group of BTC, 
the price of BTC will grown FASTer.
@_date: 2017-10-23 18:55:10
current price is a shame vs ETH.
we can earn more money if Core can give user better experience and cost.
@_date: 2017-10-20 17:29:03
You should keep because the price is nearly the lowest.
If you really want to sell ,sell it after a sharp pump.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:39:03
Forks make BTC stronger and evolved better,I like forks
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:46:16
I hope you can use polite words to express your thought if you really have thought ,LoL.
@_date: 2017-10-22 19:08:55
Miners will never give up BTC brand ,that is the most valuable part.
They already have BCH, so they dont dare fight again and again.
@_date: 2017-10-25 06:46:23
If some developers,can effectively take control of bitcoin governance, and force never change — that is a definitional failure of Bitcoin’s decentralised value proposition in itself. — gaici.com
@_date: 2017-10-25 07:20:27
 is a liar's list
All Bitcoin Cash supporters are also  NYA supporters
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:16:53
I am the writer of this article. thank you 
Thank so many comments.
First I wrote it in one night by myself ,no other man let me do it .
I will not use any 'f**k' words to reply ,thought has his own power if it is true.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:48:51
that is a competition ,not attack.
BTC is strong ,never die.
the stronger chain is true BTC
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:43:53
not killing ,that is competition and make BTC more healthy and stronger.
Bitcoin Cash is a seed of no segwit chain.
If segwit  is a bad idea ,we have chance to start BTC again from BCH
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:33:11
Core did bad work. we can see ETH development speed.
BTC  have a bad user experience.
The price because of the brand of BTC, not the work of core.
@_date: 2017-10-28 20:03:41
I dont care Nationalism  or racism.but some guys care,they use these to spread hatress in this place
@_date: 2017-10-25 10:50:49
No one  attack other coins? you can count how many "shit" and "f**ck" words in every page.
Why list every person and company who dont agree Core and call people dont use their business service. Is that not attack?
What change? Those changes you list are not user need urgently or we can say just Core and Blockstream need them. We need fast confirmation speed for years ,it is heard just need to change one parameter, but Core did not do it for years.
So Core is the most centralized  point of bitcoin industry ,NOT miners.
@_date: 2017-10-28 17:20:45
I have more proofs about my prediction.  I will write them later.
yesterday and today  they pump BCH price also a proof just like I said.
@_date: 2017-10-22 13:46:18
BCC still alive ,as a backup of original chain without segwit
