Awesome :D, I think I might have to read up on these and then probably invest in one :). Thanks for the recommendation.

Yes that is what I meant, I don't think my phone is hacked though but if it were the card would be useless after I had withdrawn my funds.

I downloaded the app here in Sweden. It is weird though, I sent 0.0015 btc but it displays the balance as 0.0015 kr btc. (kr is swedish fiat currency). So it says it is 0.0015 kr and btc lol , it is rather 7 kr and 0.0015 btc, some glitch maybe?

Wow those Verso cards look awesome. Do you know if free shipping includes Europe?
@_date: 2014-06-11 14:57:38
Yes very intresting, I am surprised no other company did it sooner though since I often see people talking about not having access to bankaccounts and creditcards.

Thanks. Maybe I should have read on the internet first before I swept my 18 dollar cryptocard :(. Well 18 Dollars is not an expensive lesson I guess :D. But then what if say cryptocards did not use your passphrase by mistake and you deposit 2 bitcoins into the account without knowing that you do not have the correct passphrase? You can never be sure until you sweep the card?

Ah okay thanks for answering so many of my points. I guess that when I invest a considerable amount I will have to lift my lazy ass and actually use a offline wallet. 
@_date: 2014-05-25 20:01:24
Thank you for offering to help. I looked up alot of different cold storage options before posting this and I feel paper wallets would work best for me. But these Verso cards I just found out about does also look very good.

Cool, I live in Stockholm, Sweden and it would be cool to meet other enthusiasts. When is it?

After watching the money and banks documentary they say money functions because of debt. It got me wondering. How does Bitcoin fix this problem? If Bitcoin would become the one true currency banks would not really be needed so how does bitcoin work around the debt fueling money?
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:41:18
Yes. I think I will have to use cold storage when I invest alot into bitcoin.
@_date: 2014-09-06 21:03:00
I am interested in your bitcoin story? Did you buy in early or were you a miner? How much did you sell and how much have you kept? Care to share?
@_date: 2014-06-03 18:33:57
Ah okay, but Coinjar is up again so I thought other wallets would be able to put up their apps again.
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:08:19
That is so cool!
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:40:25
Yeah I guess thanks. But if bitcoin is designed to work without trust can there never be bitcoin exchanges that I can trust as much as I trust my current bank?
@_date: 2014-05-25 19:29:34
Those cash keychains look awesome both for fiat and paper wallets. Pretty expensive though.
@_date: 2014-06-05 12:18:30
When people say that you should not use the same password on different services, do they seriously mean you should have a different password for every different company and store? That would be around 15 passwords I would have to keep track of, like how is that reasonable?

Ok. I made another post where I asked if my paper wallet would still be safe after scanning the private key and someone suggested that I leave some bitcoin on there after scanning the private key to see if my phone was hacked and they stole my bitcoins, I guess that would not matter then because they could just as easily hack my blockchain account were I swept the card and get the bitcoins from there right?
@_date: 2014-08-11 20:54:48
Yes that is smart. Thank You :)

Ok, too bad I can't come, the summer would work better for me. But I wish you the best of luck with the event :).
@_date: 2014-06-02 20:23:01
How would banks make money then if loanes were not debt back?

Was going to try with another USB cable so I plugged it out but now I cant seem to get the site to work properly, maybe they are having some issues with their website.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:59:45
Alright now the pinwindow appeared and I put in my pin then the "signing and sending transaction" message still remains and nothing happens.
@_date: 2015-01-04 17:03:58
Switched back to the other USB cable, problem occurs first try, I close windows and the transaction works on the second try. It always takes a minimum of 2 tries for it to work.
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:45:34
That is what I have been doing all the time, I am using chrome privacy window.
@_date: 2015-01-04 14:26:06
Problem fixed, tried with another USB cable and this time I got a confirm screen on my trezor and after confirming it installed immediately. 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:51:35
I got 2 USB cables with the device and I have had problems with both of them lol. The first one was not able to update the trezor firmware and the second one has this problem XD. I mean it is not a huge problem I can still send bitcoins just that it takes a bit longer. Thx for your help :D 
@_date: 2015-01-04 16:56:59
Tried sending with the other cable now and I get the same problem it just says "signing and sending transaction" but no keypin appears.
@_date: 2015-01-04 21:29:16
When I click the support button on their website nothing happens.
