Without knowing how they knew he had coins I think it's a bit early to assume the guy was bragging. As an example the local exchange could have sold his info.

Another source.. 
Just an FYI lots of insurance fraud happens in Thailand. People claim to be robbed when they weren't. I'm not saying that happened here, but it does happen to make one question every news post.

Only if you are a trader that is pumping and dumping. If you have established a business or service behind a coin then you have a lot more ties to the currency and therefore can't just sell up and move off.
It's like the difference between a shareholder that is day trading vs a long term investor. You're arguing a point that why should anyone care about having a say in the company simply for owning shares when they can sell them if they disagree with the direction of the company. Sure that's true from the perspective of a day trader, but long term investors have different perspective.
I'm not going to argue that you're wrong. You make some good points. All I'm trying to say is that there are some other points of view you're missing.

Except you still have the control on direction of currency issue in which coins like Decred solve with their voting process. That's still an issue with Bitcoin as those with the coins don't have any say into how the currency evolves.

How is bitcoin devs having control over your money any different than big banks? Doesn't sound like a feature at all.

So you're trying to dismiss this, but it's still a problem however much you try to handwave it away. A problem other coins solved, which is why I mentioned it's not just about the fastest and cheapest transfer method. There will always been competition between the coins as the goal posts move and more problems are discovered.

This site seems really shady.. They don't give you the bitcoin/thb rate, you just tell them how much you want to cash out and they tell you how much will be deducted from your account so that you have to do the math yourself..
bitcoin.co.th looks way better IMO because you can see the rate.. I've signed up to both for testing right now so we'll see how it works out.

So girlfriend just paid by credit card and now need to verify all her details and her balance is zero.. wtf? It didn't even tell me about verifying until AFTER they took the money. So upset about the bait and switch tactic.
Edit: So girlfriend bought on her credit card and now they won't give the money back and won't verify her account because her address isn't in english. So disappointed about they take the money before showing anything about verifying.
She's currently trying to charge back this scam company.

Thank you anyway for the site, but there was absolutely no need to take her money before verification, I was doing the whole thing with her and didn't see anything about verifying until after payment.
She phoned the bank and got the money back.

Everything was in her name, everything was done by her. I edited the story because I said "I did it" which after reading what I wrote is obviously wrong, since I was just sitting with her.


She wasn't prepared to wait it out. She just wants the bitcoins to buy one thing only that you can't use a credit card for.

I think it's unfair to call it a ponzi scheme, but he's right that it's too easy to manipulate the market, fraud, etc..

I lost 120 BTC that I wouldn't have if mtgox announced they had been hacked when originally discovered. I guess I'm to blame for trusting your company, but why didn't you tell anyone? Why is the bankruptcy process taking so long? Do you think realistically we're ever going to get any money back?
