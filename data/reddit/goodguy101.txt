Have you looked into [Ethereum?](

Thanks. I'll read over these while I have time at work today.

I can't say anything for other countries, but in the US you would have a really hard time doing that.

It would have to be untraceable to others. So no one can see that I am a racist because I didn't vote for the black guy. I did though ...vote for the black guy.

What keeps me thinking it is feesable is that no matter what complications may arise, like detaching the information about whether or not someone voted from what they voted for, it can be implemented in code. No matter how complicated, it can be coded.
Unlike having people doing things like it is now, you cannot have anything too complicated because people are dumb.

What about something similar to Darkcoin that has some kind of anonymous recording into the blockchain?

He is a wizard at tried-and-true, old-school value of products/markets. He is right on the money, in that NO-ONE really knows how to judge and predict the value of Bitcoin. It is a new technology and although I think it is, and can make good arguments for it being revolutionary, I can't necessarily prove it.

This is actually along the lines of what I was thinking. We have a Social Security number, so why not have a government issued voting number (address). We vote and there is a verification system that makes sure that each address appears in the blockchain **only once** and there are publicly viewed accounts that show votes showing up in the candidates "wallet" that can be seen in realtime as they're verified.

Can you give the detailed instructions in one sentence?

My point is that they are as liquid as a stock or bond, which is not very. If it is supposed to be a currency, why is it such a pain to exchange it for another currency (fiat that is)?

It just seems kinda like flying cars. They exist, but since there currently isn't a structured integration into the existing infrastructure, they can only be used in isolated areas.
Bitcoin supporters (I am one) seem to be in a bubble where "all you need is more demand and the problems will work themselves out," yet I think it's the other way around. There won't be a bigger demand until more people can see a frictionless means of liquidity. Kinda like bitcoin is in a philosophical Mexican standoff with itself.

The hiragana (Japanese alphabet) character for *sa* (top middle) makes the most sense. It's what you'd use to spell out *Sa*toshi.

Find out how the brackets break down for your state(s). It's possible you could live off BTC solely and pay tuition with it and only owe $2-3k in CGT. Buuuut, if you go over into the next bracket by a fucking cent, you could owe more than twice that.

I shit you not, my friend proposed an idea of bitcoin mining tours. I jokingly suggested we let them do a few hashes by hand. What to do with all the $$$?
