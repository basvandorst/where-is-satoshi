Does anyone know where is this? I am trying to get bitcoins and it won't let me.
@_date: 2015-05-27 09:26:01
It's the game app. Lots of malware built in.

I am a HUGE proponent for bitcoins. I am a power miner and ran a $100 millionish exchange. However, I would wait right now. There are some bitcoin finding reports and some blockchain clone reports coming out. Also, the Chinese pump is not as strong as it used to be. They are exploring making a country digital coin and 2016 will be the year of the clones from banks. Wait for the dip and rebuy back in for the halvening.

Brian is pure evil. I met him once and Coinbase moved to crush my business and ratted me out to the Feds.
@_date: 2016-01-10 07:20:45
Just so you know. BigVern and RealSolid is the same person.

Also, Bitmain ships crappy machines outside of China and use better, more powerful ones for themselves.

Is Satoshi still alive?

bitlicense is a play by big companies to filter out their competitors.

News flash - Developers don't like working with each other. Too many chefs in the kitchen.

OP HERE:
I just got a response from Coinbase. It looks like there was a bug in their system.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:40:19
I withdrew all my BTC the other day buy click the max button. The next day there was a -0.00000000044 BTC. Looks like Math error due to floating point math.

I am not going to spend 15 cents to fix a 0 balance.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:31:07
Minimum buy is $1. I am not going to support Coinbase because of their Bitcoin Classic stance.
@_date: 2015-07-31 08:22:30
The required use of a money transmitter license and a bank account discourage people like me to make bitcoin products.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:44:02
OP HERE:
I DID click the button seeing that it went to coinbase.
This is what I get when I try to fix it. The minimum buy is $1 and the required fee is $0.15. I AM NOT GOING TO SPEND 15 cents to fix a $0.00 balance. That is against principles.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:33:48
I DID click the button and it went to Coinbase. .0000000044 is like $0.00 and not even a cent. I did a full withdrawl of all my BTC. The minimum buy is $1 of bitcoins and I refused to waste time over $0.00.

I heard this game is Pay to Win. Free is useless.
@_date: 2016-02-12 02:27:26
OP here.
Geesh. Not sure why you guys are so hateful.
The issue is that the minimum buy is $1 of bitcoins with a $0.15 transaction fee. I have to spend $1.15 to fix less than a cent negative balance. I don't want to send any more money to Coinbase because of their Bitcoin Classic stance.
And also I did submit a ticket - I am still waiting. I am sending email now.

Smells like Mt Gox. Bot Willie is back. It's not that hard to make some fake trades when you control the database.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:14:41
Sorry. I forgot about date differences here in the US and Europe. I meant March 5th.
@_date: 2015-03-04 21:16:14
I just saw 2000 BTC drop on Bitstamp. I have a few miners but no skin in the game. I would like to buy some more bitcoins after selling at $280.
@_date: 2017-05-09 04:33:02
This here is a lie. Site was working fine. Chat was working. Their order books were frozen yet orders are able to get through. It's fishy that orders were happening and the API was up before the website was up.
@_date: 2015-03-27 16:26:53
So they are only giving out a total of $2.50 on their PROMO. Wow. Sad!
@_date: 2017-05-09 08:06:12
The site was working. There was no DDOS. They froze the order book and simulated a DDOS. It was shady enough that the API side was up ahead of the site coming back online letting bots trade before users can get in.

Here's an updated article:
I can't find list of registered bidders.
"The coins will be sold in two series of 20,000 and 30,000 BTC. Each series will be divided into 10 blocks of 2,000 and 3,000 coins respectively. The usual bidding rules as in previous auctions apply, the bidders will not have an opportunity to view other bids or change theirs. What is somewhat unique about this auction is that the market initially didn’t care about it. While the two previous auction announcements were met by heavy selling, the announcement for this auction saw no such selling. It’s possible that market participants have priced in the auction due to the sentencing of Ross Ulbricht , the previous owner of the coins. - See more at:

yeah people that know the code better than the branch whose testnet is crashing
@_date: 2017-07-17 21:49:54
Don't do it. They don't honor warranty. Their parts didn't have enough cooling paste and my machine died out in a well air-conditioned area. Then they had issues with the SD card that came with it and refused to boot. I had a few that had bad thermometers that they refuse to talk to me about.
@_date: 2017-07-16 22:44:51
As long as you never use their customer service you are fine.
@_date: 2015-03-05 02:52:59
You mean shot down $10?

A lot of folks think Segwit2x is the official bitcoin branch.
@_date: 2017-07-17 09:30:17
If you check the issues in the repository, they are resulting multiple SEGMENTATION FAULT issues. I haven't had a chance to clone and play with testnet but 8 weeks is not enough time to handle code that hande $60B.
@_date: 2015-03-05 05:54:00
It went up from $220 because of Kim Dotcom, BIT ETF, and Bitcoin Foundation elections are done.
@_date: 2017-07-17 07:48:36
You know this is fake Segwit right?
@_date: 2015-10-07 18:23:40
Maybe after the final auction.
@_date: 2017-07-17 03:34:16
Civil war within Bitcoin right now. China/Jihan Wu/Bitmaintech miner wants more mining fees and use secret ASICboost exploit. They also want to increase giant block sizes to kick out the smaller miners and ensure monopoly. Jihan's group came up with scams like Bitcoin Unlimited and Segwit2X. Now Segwit2X threatens a fork sometime soon. Blockchain could be disrupted. They have been so resistant to Segwit that we had to call the US Air Force UASF.

Noobs will lose BTC in the process. I think exchange has better experience maintaining wallets. Good luck with that DAT file and running an uncorrupted wallet.
