I appreciate this post.

It's not, and they've said so. They don't want to deal with it yet. Maybe next year. 
(They are just not interested afaik, and specifically don't want to deal with the legalities of tax law and other related things)

I also relate it to some lyrics by System of a Down ([Kinda nsfw?](






disco = party or entertainment
nabisco = snacks / food

Definition error. Classical and austrian economists (of those original eras) defined inflation by the money supply, not a change in value. Many still do this without clarification of the old usage.


Deflation *is* fine, just as much as inflation is fine.


You can only leverage an economy so far.


Lmao. The USD is a world currency, that's why the fed can do what they want - it is *not* a closed system  - upwards of 50% of USD is held overseas by individuals as well as businesses.

"The market" is human beings making decisions and carrying out those decisions. While usually not inclusive of government in colloquial language, all human actions are part of the market. Therefore, nothing can be solved outside of "the market."
The real issue is that people looking to solve problems tend to solve them better as individuals with knowledge and capacity within that area of expertise. While others think that government should solve the issues in behalf of the people. 
It's like many internet based programs - you need hundreds or even hundreds of thousands of actors (testers) to find all the kinks and bugs in the system. Government can't do that nearly as easily as the vast network of people referenced in "the market."
One example of this in action is what has been called ["the wisdom of crowds."]( 
Another similar concept, is an experiment that is done at the Univ of Iowa, where [bids are made in relationship to elections, etc.](
Oh but armchair economists right?

My comment is highly related to your derping (your previous comment), which kind of derp is common in these threads/subs. Thus I a. defined the market b. defined how it's used c. gave further information.

Please, tell me how bitcoin is fiat, since fiat means declared or mandated. In the context of money it can mean both decreed money (national currency) and decreed value.
@_date: 2014-09-01 07:35:42
My point is that bitcoin isn't fiat, it has no declared, mandated, or otherwise decreed value. It can't have because it has no higher/central authority to do so. 
@_date: 2014-10-06 08:10:26
BTC isn't your thing then. Please do not become a cheerleader in ruining what some of us think is a good thing simply because you don't like it. That's how it is fair, you don't *have* to use it.

Don't let the haters get to you. For so many bitcoin is a kneejerk reaction of politics and concept. It's so many things though, and the mathematics is a pretty fundamental aspect.

A large amount of doesn't understand it, and that's fine. It'll take some time, it's a big deal that has a lot of different aspects to it.
@_date: 2014-10-05 17:49:16
Well, to someone like me who wants to use BTC in daily transactions, price doesn't matter as long as the btc price fluctuation isn't large. Because even when price was 550-600 on a daily/weekly basis it really doesn't matter to me. 
However a sustained heavy drop from day to day? Yeah, I'm not touching that til it remotely hits a bottom. I don't care if that bottom is $1 or $20 - if it stabilizes, it's still btc therefore useful.
@_date: 2014-08-20 12:48:08
I have heard many BTC fans differentiate virtual and digital. Virtual has some basic synonyms that do not mean digital, nor do they mean realistic. Virtual money therefore can be seen as anything that is make-believe while being both digital and non-digital. WoW gold is 'make believe' gold. 
Digital is more encompassing, specifying that the currency is software or computer oriented. Squares are rectangles, but not all rectangles are squares sort of deal.
I will note that some news sources (more technical onces) differentiate these terms correctly as paleh0rse described.
@_date: 2014-08-11 15:11:39
Well, there is your name.
@_date: 2014-10-04 01:34:27


I think the drop is a combination of this, as well as, a situation of bitcoin still being mined at a rate faster than potential adoption. Lots of places are starting to accept it, but access - as well as knowledge of btc - is still developmental.
@_date: 2014-10-05 18:07:16


The comment is perfectly logical by technicality, which is exactly how I meant it.


So why did you repeat it?
@_date: 2014-08-12 04:19:01
Yeah, which is why I'm talking specifically about the cost of the markers, not the success rate. :)
@_date: 2014-10-17 18:53:48


Hell, Encryption is like locking the doors so that you and I don't get robbed or other issues.
If a culture/region is peaceful and low in crime, you can go without locking your doors without much consequence. The more perceived danger, the more protection you might want on your stuff, whether digital or physical.

Well, I worked in retail for a short bit. Every station has one of those bill markers. While they aren't crazy expensive - it's a cost.

"Number on the internet that can be hacked."
Oh you mean like all credit/debit/paypal and such forms of digital currency? So hackable. Meanwhile the real hacks are the ones controlling the modern currency markets. Central Bankers.
@_date: 2014-09-23 23:46:21


No kidding. I think they view it as a liability mostly. Steam does various things with taxes and sales and whatnot. IIRC you can get automatic tax forms for sales on the community markets, as well as the cosmetic markets (like dota 2). They do a lot to be an international "triple-threat" so to say. 
Partly, I don't blame them though. Imagine trying to cover your butt for laws on BTC when it might be constantly changing, both at the state and national level. On the other hand there are plenty of processors to take the real financial risks, so I do think it's a bit lame. I personally use BTC to buy steam cards though.

Savings does not require reinvestment. Savings is originally and literally a buffer. Extra stock (cattle) or grain, or the capacity to purchase something in a future moment - such as when a window breaks. Savings in cash assets is rarely outside a financial institution. And the average american has literally a few hundred dollars up to a couple thousand in savings. 
The average american is 1 mediocre emergency from bankruptcy - divorce, a lost job, a flood, new or recurring health issues, etc. That and financial literacy in america is atrocious. "Hoarding" is something you do when you stock 10,000 rolls of toilet paper in your 1 bedroom apartment, not $300 in your cookie jar.

It probably depends on the store. I worked at a clothing shop. Literally anyone paying with cash is using $50 or $100 something around 90% of the time.
But yeah, it's not really that big of a deal.

This is exactly right. Ancapism isn't about no laws, it's about individualism and ownership of property. To violate another being, the fruits of their labor, or that which is otherwise their property is exactly what ancapism is against. Removing the greatest monopoly and controlling player (the govt) is quintessential. Laws would still exist. Rules but no rulers.
