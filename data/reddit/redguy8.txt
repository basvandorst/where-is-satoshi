Called Vanguard today.  They don't allow trades in CXBTF.  The said "blue sky laws" prevent such trading.  I mentioned that Fidelity allowed it, and I asked if Vanguard had any plan to change their policy in the future.  But no policy change was offered.

Can buy thru Fidelity.  Fee is $55 (partly to pay FX fees, I guess).

AFAIK, Coinbase does not report this information to the IRS (in general).
If you get a 1099-B (or any 1099) from Coinbase, then you have to worry about the information Coinbase is providing to the IRS.
At this point, I believe the standard practice (in the US) is to file Bitcoin (and other digital asset) sales marked with Box C because you didn't receive a Form 1099-B.
In general, "Box C" transactions are not reported to the IRS, so you provide information about buy/sell date, basis and gain/loss.
In other words, don't simply take the report from Coinbase.  You may need to adjust (ex. remove simple transfers) Coinbase's report.

May want to enable withdrawal only to a white-listed account under Bittrex "Settings" :
By adding a digital currency address to this list, you will only be able to withdraw that specified currency to one of its matching addresses. To add or delete a currency and address pair, you must have two-factor authentication enabled and provide your authenticator code before submitting any changes. Warning: If you have this enabled on any currency, all currencies need to have a specified withdrawal address.
